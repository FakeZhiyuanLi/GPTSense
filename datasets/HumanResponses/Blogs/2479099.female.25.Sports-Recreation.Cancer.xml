      Maybe I'm strange, but right this minute, I'm sitting here crying. For no real reason at all. Just crying. Yeah, it's been a bad day, but we all have them, and I'm not one to just sit around and cry about it. The reality seems to have set in that in about two weeks, I will be without a job. Scary feeling. Christmas is coming up and that stresses the hell out of me.  I've decided I'm not a terribly nice person. More like mean. I screamed at a kid this morning because she wasn't doing what I told her and made her cry. She's one of the toughest athletes on our team, and I made her cry. I would classify her as a tougher athlete than I am, and never once did a coach make me cry. So, what do I do as a follow up to this screaming display? I pick a fight with Jake. It's near impossible to fight with him, but I found a way and he's not talking to me right now. I don't blame him, I wouldn't talk to me either. I also managed to make my headhunter cry today as well, although I really don't think that had anything to do with me. She was crying the first time I met her. I think it's her thing. So, it seems that crying is the theme for the day.  One fun thing happened today. We had a fundraiser 3-on-3 basketball tournament between the coaches of all the sports on campus. Nothing feels better than schooling basketball coaches at basketball. They always discount the track coaches as little waifish people who don't know how to do anything but run. Well, this year, they had a little secret weapon. A 6'2" former all-stater in everything, former volleyball wizard, and former sprinter and now long distance maniac. Myself, Jake and Buck just dominated the hell out of that tournament. When I play anything pissed off, it doesn't bode well for the opposing team. At one point, the men's basketball coach asked the women's basketball coach why I wasn't recruited to play basketball instead of volleyball. He informed him that I was, but that I couldn't swing 3 sports and still remain sort of sane. After a monster block, the men's coach turned to the women's coach again and said that he wasn't sure I was sane to begin with. Gotta love coaches. We're odd. In a good way. Sometimes.  All in all, I need a job. And I need it fast. I hate office jobs. With a passion. That's my only option.

      Why does waking up an hour earlier than usual make my day seem 18 hours longer? Better yet, why does that stupid woodpecker think my apartment building is a good place to tear into at 8am? Every goddamned Sunday that motherfucker shows up at the worst damned time of day. I'm trying to get my sleep on, and nature goes and screws with me. It's 4 in the pm right now and it seems like it should be at LEAST 8. Probably because this is the season that it starts to get dark around noon. Damned winter. Oh, and speaking of winter. 68 degrees yesterday. Today? 35 degrees and snow. Iowa weather, I just don't get it. I guess it's good that I chose to wash my car yesterday instead of today.  My god, could this weekend have been more boring? Ugh! No one, and I mean NO ONE, was around at all. Jake was at his parent's for some home cooking and to pick up some new poles he had shipped there. I could have gone along, but really, I hate to impose on them as much as I do. I mean, Greg and Cathy are probably going to have to put up with me for the rest of their lives, why wear out my welcome early? That and sometimes it's nice to have some apart time from Jake. Not that I don't love having him here all the time, because I do, but you get what I'm saying. I can walk around in my underwear and not worry about grabby hands, or just skip a shower because who cares if I smell, or make a meal and actually get more than half of a serving. I can make my coffee and not hear him complain about the smell (I don't get his dislike of coffee scent. I love the smell of coffee). I can throw out all those strange containers that have been in the fridge for way too long because he "might want to eat that later". But I miss him. Who knew I wouldn't like to spend more than a day by myself? I certainly didn't. I used to relish days of me time a few years ago. Now? They make me nuts. One day I can handle, but more than that and I start to get bored. Even watching football and yelling at the TV isn't as much fun when no one else is here to yell with me (or at least look at me like I've lost my damn mind).  He'll be back tomorrow. Which is good, because if he's gone any longer I'm sure I will have scrubbed the finish right off the cabinets and walls. I hate cleaning, and only do it when I'm so bored, that it's either clean or remodel. Remodeling isn't allowed in my building (but I certainly would like to. This stark white wall, brown shag carpeting and avocado green kitchen flooring would be the first things to get a change), so that's not an option. I did manage to avoid going to the store for the standard quart containers of Starbucks Ice Cream that I usually gorge myself on when he is gone. I attribute that to the fact that I have a dollar in my wallet and around $15 in my checking account and don't get paid for another 2 weeks (damned university and it's once-a-month payroll bullshit). Hey, it just hit me that the next paycheck will be the last from the university. Which has now booted my anxiety about finding the next job into high gear. Great.  Are you aware that there is nothing on television on Sunday afternoons if you're not interested in the New England Patriots playing the Chicago Bears? Nothing. Well, unless you're interested in the WTA championships with Jennifer Capriatti and Serena Williams. Serena isn't wearing a bizarre outfit like she normally does, and Jennifer has decided she wants some unfortunate bangs on her forehead, so I have no interest in this. Serena will win, simply because she's Serena. That and she's huge compared to Jennifer. It's like watching team of Shaqs versus a team of Mugsys. Big and powerful beats small and weak every time. Even if that's not what fairy tales tell you.  I should probably be concerned with this, but for some reason I'm not. I smacked my knee something fierce on the desk last night, drew blood even, and today it's swelled up like a cantaloupe. Two guesses. I dislodged the prosthetic kneecap and fluid has formed to protect shit in there or I just have a pentiant for swelling up now that all the moving parts in there are fake. It doesn't really hurt, so I'm going with the latter. Once the swelling goes away (if it does), I'll know for sure.  Christmas. It's coming up ridiculously fast. Last year at this time I was finished Christmas shopping. This year? I haven't started. I have no idea what to get people. I have no idea what I'm going to be able to afford to spend on anyone, or whether I'll be able to afford it at all. And if not, then what do I do? I can't NOT give people Christmas gifts, because they'll think I don't care anymore. And I'll be damned if I'm telling anyone that I am that broke. Call it pride, but to me, it's a failure.  Alright, what is it with my friends just not calling me anymore? Jamie moved back here from Seattle and I haven't heard from her in a month (and cheesy forwards don't count). She called me EVERY weekend when she lived out there. I am attributing this to the fact that she has options now and I'm disposable (that's how it's always been with her. If you're not staring her right in the face and talking about her to her, she forgets you exist). Hey, I understand that you have this new fuck buddy and all, but just because you're sleeping with him, doesn't mean the rest of us fall off the face of the earth. And Jill. Hey, just because you went and got married doesn't mean I just disappear. I would estimate that it's been 6 months since I've heard anything from Jeana. She may have dropped out of school, or died and I'll never know. Girl never returns phone calls. Hell, Jill is the only one that does. Kim was out of town this weekend, but again with the getting married thing and forgetting your friends. It just seems that lately, I've been doing a lot of calling and the phone hasn't rung much around here.  Ah, and my mother. Hey, you called me for a Christmas shopping list by Monday. I got that to you, don't bitch at me that none of the things are things you think anyone will buy. You asked what I wanted, not what I thought everyone would buy me. If I were to make that list, it would include an ugly t-shirt, an ugly pair of socks and a dish scraper (remember, that's what I got last year, and don't be surprised if I decide to regift that shit, it's still in the box it came in). I'm aware that none of those things will be purchased for me, because in the 20 years I've been making those lists, there has yet to be an item purchased from my list. I stopped getting my hopes up about 13 years ago. Yes, I only put expensive things on that list because I know damned well that I will end up buying it for myself at some point, and I'd like you to know that the $15 you spend on me a year doesn't really add up (especially when you bitch about it) to the $90+ items you buy for my brother.  Oh hell, I hate the holidays. It means I have to spend time with my dysfunctional family that wishes I would just find a new one. On that note, I need to go make something for dinner. It's cold, so I'm thinking chili or chicken soup. I guess we'll see what's in there.

      Ah, Christmas shopping. Hate it. Hate it a lot. BUT, I found the coolest gift for my brother this year. I fully expect him to revert back to a 6 year old on Christmas morning when he rips into his new old handheld baseball and football games. He used to love the baseball game when he was a kid, and I'm sure he'll love the football game too. I really expect to see the full body little kid at Christmas happy dance.  Now, as for shopping for Jake, that's another matter entirely. Not a damned clue what I'm going to get him. Not a single clue. What do you buy someone who has everything? And that's literal. He really does have everything. He even says he has everything (which makes it really aggravating when you ask him what kind of things he'd like for Christmas and he replies "um, I don't think I need anything at all"). If anyone has any idea, email me, please. PLEASE!?!  On a slightly less Christmas related note, my jaw is wired shut. Yes, folks, it's wired shut (and I'm sure some of you are thinking "well, it's about time"). I was running the Saturday after Thanksgiving and found myself faced with two choices. 1) Get hit, and likely killed, by a car, or 2) dive out of the way. I, wisely, chose option two and wound up not getting hit by the car, but instead doing a face plant into the pavement. My jaw is all jacked up and the bruising was terrible at first. Now it's down to that little yellowy green tone that looks similar to baby poo. So, anyway, I am to have my yap wired shut for 10 days at least. Well, today was day 10 and the old doctor said no dice on taking out the wiring. Something about the joint not being strong enough to deal with normal chewing yet. So that means that I have another 5-10 days of liquid food. Do you understand how much that sucks? Do you? I can only deal with soup so much before I go insane. I hit insane around last Wednesday. I'm to full on whacko now. This little wiring job also means no running. It also makes me nuts because I don't enjoy making the first impression with potential employers with my face all wonky. So that pushes back any looking into that by another week. Son of a bitch!! I need a job, and at this rate, it's not coming until the new year. 2003 better be a good year, or I'm gonna be really pissy about it!

      Well, a non-decision was my decision on that drama reported last week. I just asked both parties for another couple weeks. I did that yesterday morning and already I regret it. This morning I had to oversee a track meet. Not only that, but I got stuck overseeing and taking marks for the pole vault. Now, I don't know why that happened, because it hasn't ever happened before, but I have a feeling someone had a hand in it. Especially when that someone made every attempt to make me insanely jealous for the entirety of the meet. That and he has the ability to look ridiculously hot when he wants to. And today, he clearly wanted to. The phrase "How dare he?" ran through my mind (and I'm sure, across my face) at least 15 times in the 5 hours I was there. And then I realized that I have no right to ask "how dare he?" because it's my fault he's being that way. If I hadn't broad sided him with that information seconds after he got home yesterday, he may have had a few seconds to absorb it first. But I couldn't just sit on it and let him get comfortable back here. I should have, but because I was only thinking of me, I didn't. He also clearly has spread the word of what I did, because there were some dirty and "how dumb are you" looks. Even Buck noticed the tension (and to be honest, Buck wouldn't notice a truck coming at him until it hit him). I'm starting to think I'm pretty dumb for both putting him through this, and spending more time thinking about how this will affect me, instead of thinking about how it'll affect other people. Gah! I don't know. I just don't know what to do. Can't I just have them both? A month ago, everything was perfect. One was a friend, and one was my soul mate. Now it's all jumbled up in my head and in my heart and I don't know what to do. I'm even so desperate for a decision that I sat down last night and made a list of what I love about both of them. How ridiculous does that sound? Pretty ridiculous, but I figured out why this is such a problem for me. The lists were pretty much the same. The differences were just in what they do. They're basically the same guy, but one works in an office, and the other works on the track. One is responsible and dedicated, and the other is free-spirited and dedicated. I don't know what to do with that information, because really, it just makes this decision harder.

      For those of you wondering about my dramatic last few days, well, that hasn't changed at all. I still don't have a clue what I'm going to do about that. Anyway, I am just posting some song lyrics I ran across (well, actually searched for because I heard the song on some show and pretty much decided I loved the lyrics). So, here they are. The song is Half-Life by Duncan Sheik (and why that makes me think old-school, I have no idea)...  I'm awake in the afternoon I fell asleep in the living room and it's one of those moments when everything is so clear  before the truth goes back into hiding I want to decide 'cause it's worth deciding to work on finding something more than this fear   It takes so much out of me to pretend tell me now, tell me how to make amends  maybe, I need to see the daylight to leave behind this half-life don't you see I'm breaking down  lately, something here don't feel right this is just a half-life is there really no escape? no escape from time of any kind  I keep trying to understand this thing and that thing, my fellow man I guess I'll let you know when i figure it out  but I don't mind a few mysteries they can stay that way it's fine by me and you are another mystery i am missing  It takes so much out of me to pretend  maybe, I need to see the daylight to leave behind this half-life don't you see I'm breaking down  Lately, something here don't feel right this is just a half-life is there really no escape? no escape from time of any kind  come on lets fall in love come on lets fall in love come on lets fall in love again  'cause lately something here don't feel right this is just a half-life, without you I am breaking down  wake me, let me see the daylight save me from this half-life let's you and I escape escape from time  come on lets fall in love come on lets fall in love come on lets fall in love again  ...so that was it. It's a really good song, and I suggest you find the single and buy it.

      Ugh! Drama. All over the place with drama. You know how some people complain because they're always bored and they think their lives are ridiculously, nauseatingly boring? Well, I'd give my right leg to be able to say that. Seriously. I'm going to spend the remainder of my afternoon eating a banana, curled up behind a chair in my living room where nobody will be able to send more drama in my direction. I don't need any more. I have enough. Thanks.  Scratch that. Skip the banana. Switch that to a bottle of rum and a box of cookies and a very mind-numbingly normal magazine or something. Oh, and if you bother trying to call, I'm not answering the phone. I'll be blasting the wonderful song "No More Drama" by Mary J. Blige so loud, people in Botswana may just get their groove on from it. Yes, I did just say "get their groove on". That? Is how ridiculously out of whack I am right now.  Carry on with your lives and sincerely hope you have a day full of nothing.  Much later... Well, I finished off that bottle of rum, and the box of cookies and probably 14 magazines. I no longer have to blast "No More Drama" because it's officially the only noise rattling around in my skull. Didn't make the drama go away. Just made me remember that I have a huge decision to make. A life changing decision. If I make the wrong one, I am essentially tossing everything away. Only catch is that I don't have any idea which is the wrong one, if the wrong one is really that detrimental, or if I can live with myself after the decision is made. Oh, and on top of that, I have to find a job ASAP because just in the past 3 days around here, two businesses laid off everyone (around 300 people) and I need to make sure I don't get lost in that shuffle. Fun times, huh? Who wants to switch places with me? Anyone? Please!?  This may be the one time in my life that I wish someone else was making my decisions for me. And for someone who generally seems so in control of her life (wow, do some people not know me at all), I have no damned clue what to do, how to do it, or whether to do anything at all. I'm only one person. This decision seems to me like it should be made by a bunch of people sitting in a big room in Washington or something. Too much on the line for one person to decide this. And we all know I'm not perfect, so lord knows I have a pretty damned good shot of fucking it up real good.   Okay, so here's the deal (and since I know that none of the people involved read this site, I'm safe in reporting this fun (but not) situation. So if you know any of these people, and talk to them often, please keep this commentary to yourself, or I'll kick your teeth in). My ex-boyfriend (who I was with for about 5 years and is now one of my very close friends) hit me with some news a few days ago. He no longer wants to do the friend thing anymore and wants me back as a girlfriend. And he's about as serious as one person can be, and he's pursuing like a mad-man.  Now let's get a little background on this little relationship. The ex and I were together for five years. We got together just before my sophomore year in high school (just before his junior year). After he graduated he decided to go to school in CF because that's where he knew I intended to go. I don't know that he ever thought about going anywhere else, and he never said anything about it. His main goal in life was making me happy (a good thing, right? well, not always). Well, I finally get to school and we officially become the most boring couple on campus. We don't fight, we don't really go out, we don't do much of anything but study, eat, and sleep (and in my case, go to practices and work my ass off). Sure, we have fun with each other and laugh and do whatever it is that young kids did at that time (it seems so long ago, that I almost don't even remember what that was). We were so comfortable with each other (which happens when you know each other your whole lives), that it became more of a friendship than anything else. So, one day near the end of my sophomore year, he comes to me and says that we just need to take a break and be away from each other for a while. At the time, I find it to be an all right idea, mostly because he's going to be off doing an internship and I won't see him all summer anyway, and also because I knew we were in a rut and that seemed like a good idea to get ourselves out of it. So, we take a break.  A couple months later, we both rolled back into town for the year and he showed up with a brand new girlfriend. There was me all shocked and hurt and not knowing what to do with myself, and being pissed off because the girl is extraordinarily nice and could easily have been one of my friends. Well, there was my signal to move on (and it smacked me right in the face because I wasn't even looking for it. I was still assuming we'd get back together, even though we hadn't talked about it). So, I showed up for the first day of track practice like a maniac and basically ran until I nearly collapsed, because, at this point, it'd been a few days and I hadn't eaten, slept, or even approached sanity since I got that news.  So I was running and looking like death warmed over and looking meaner and more pissed off than I'd probably ever looked in my life and Jake came over, grabbed my arm and demanded I stop and tell him what my deal is. Now, at that point in my life, Jake and I were not friends, and in fact, I couldn't stand him. He'd been arrogant, he'd been destructive, and he hadn't given a shit about much of anything but himself. So this? Was definitely strange because he knew that I was not his biggest fan, and he knew the likelihood of me decking him was higher than average. He took that chance anyway, because he knew something was totally wrong. I don't remember this, but he told me that he said something to me that would have normally sent me slinging insults back his way, and instead I reacted with nothing but a completely defeated look (to the point where he thought I may actually cry. And if you know me, that's not something that would ever happen in public). So, anyway, he demanded to know what was wrong, and that he was going to find me after practice and we were going to talk about it, whether I wanted to or not. Blah, blah, blah, I told him, he was really nice about it and it turned out he and his girlfriend were at the beginning stages of the rut my ex and I had been in prior to our break up. And here begins our friendship.  So, cut to winter break of that same year. My ex came into the office where I worked and semi-excitedly tells me he's asked this girl to marry him and she accepted. Talk about air being sucked out of a room at a ridiculously rapid pace. At the time, I was dating someone else, albeit completely not serious. The guy was fun to be around, but he was basically all about parties, and with my schedule, there just wasn't a lot of time for fun. Well, depressed, serious, non-partier pv just isn't the type of girl that this guy really wanted to be around, so he ended it and I was about as okay with that as one person can be (a little hurt because I would have liked to be the one on the giving end of the dumping, but not at all crushed by it).  Well, a couple days later Jake found out that his girlfriend was a crazy bitch (which I'd known for a very long time, but refrained from mentioning) and dumped her (after she'd dumped him about 12 times in two weeks and then demanded to get back together). So this, for the first time since we met, left us both single at the same time, and both not exactly in the most normal frame of mind. Yadda, yadda, yadda, we ended up dating.  Okay, to make this last part a little shorter (yeah, I have a tendency to ramble), I'm just going to say that eventually, I became very good friends with the girl who married my ex-boyfriend, and then also become friends with him again (after about 10 months or so). To the point where, I was a bridesmaid in their wedding. Picture this, if you will. The man you had planned on marrying from the age of about 6 is getting married and you're not the bride, but the one to the left of her. Bizarre, no? Well, just to show you how completely strange I really am, I didn't have much of a problem with it, because he was happy and that's what mattered. His family? Well, they were completely confused by this whole thing, because they'd all assumed I'd be the one in white when he got married. So, anyway, I was at this wedding where my ex-boyfriend was getting married to one of my newer friends and I was with Jake and everyone was ridiculously happy. Without question, everyone was happy. Not everyone liked everyone else, but we were all happy (let's just say that the ex and Jake are not fans of one another. At. All).  Fast forward another 10 months or so. Tragedy struck and my ex's wife was killed in a terrible car accident. He wound up locking himself in his house and refusing to talk to anyone, and his family called the only person they could think of that had dealt with this sort of thing head on. So, they called me. Anyway, I finally got him talking and myself and his dad decided that being in that house by himself was not a good idea and that he needed to get away from there for a little while, just to calm himself and to have someone there to listen to him and reassure him that life would go on and that he should not just give up on everything else he had going for him. So, where did he decide was the best place for him to deal with all this? My apartment. One week turned into two and two turned into a month and then I just had to put my foot down and send him back up to his job and his home. Jake was not too pleased with this little situation (let's just say we were working on some trust issues when this all came about, and this set us back a little...if I were to get into that story, I'd need another website to cover it all).  Jump ahead another 8 months and we're at the part where my ex tells me he wants to get back together with me. He's one of my best friends and I love both he and Jake for different and similar reasons. Now, somewhere at the end of this thing, I'm going to lose one and I hate that. One guy who I've known basically my entire life and one who I feel like I've known my entire life. Both who I'd be crazy to not marry in a second if they asked me. Both, who if I choose between and choose the other would most likely never forgive me. Both who understand me so well that without either of them, I'm essentially incomplete. So how the hell do I decide here? I can honestly say that I love them both.   DRAMA!

      Well, shit on a shingle. I went to all the trouble of logging in here and now I can't for the life of me remember what it was that was so stinking important that I wanted to post it immediately. Guess it wasn't that important. Or maybe it was and my mind has escaped me. I'd bet the latter. Eh, I'll be back when I remember and am in the mood to lose my way with words (yes, that was a reference to "3x5", why do you ask?).  it's later... Okay, 3 hours later I remembered what it was I was going to talk about. The Grammy's! Norah Jones got on with her bad self and just kicked some major crappy music ass. Nervous while performing, but it makes her even more endearing to her fans. Love her! But, BUT, my all-time favorite Grammy moment ever? John Mayer with "This moment is kicking my ass" and "I promise to catch up" as he's accepting his much deserved (but very surprising) award. Surprising, at least, until they were announcing the nominees and his applause was literally ten-fold of what the others were receiving. Stiff competition in his category (Sting, Elton John, James Taylor) and yet he still managed to swipe that award because he is truly deserving of it. Not to say the others weren't, but this guy is giving a new face and new popularity to great music and even greater songwriting. His performance of "Your Body Is A Wonderland" just rocked (and the fact that he didn't wear his Armani to perform it? even better). Seriously, if you don't currently have Room for Squares in your CD collection, you should be ashamed of yourself and should rectify that by immediately getting your ass to Target and picking up a copy! And, while you're there, check and see if they have Inside Wants Out and Any Given Thursday (they probably don't, so you should find them elsewhere and buy them). Oh, OH, and if you're looking for a concert to beat all others? Check him out this summer with Counting Crows! Counting Crows people. Old school (well, old in the sense that these people were playing with my eardrums every morning on my drive to high school). When they announce the dates, I'll let you know. I'll also see you at one of those concerts because damnit, he doesn't come around here very often and I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss that. I've seen him perform once live and it was long before he was famous. It was in a little (well, comparatively little) bar in Iowa City and it was literally the best concert I've ever been to. Now, that doesn't really mean that much because I haven't been to that many concerts, but take my word for it, this guy is going to be doing this for a very long time at a very high level. At the Grammy's, he called James Taylor "the blueprint". I have no doubt that some day years from now, someone will be calling Mr. John Mayer, "the blueprint". Amazing. Simply amazing.  Okay, so now that you have the 411 on all that, get your credit card out of your damned pocket/wallet/purse and spend, spend, spend!!! Totally worth it.  Now, on to something else (also from my previous entry today, and also forgotten by me in the 3 seconds it took to log in). Something is majorly wrong with the heat in this building. Since Monday, I've been molested by the intense heat going on in here! My thermostat has been set at 80 all winter and has never seemed all that warm to me (and the little room temp indicator on it has remained right below 80 all year). Well, Monday night I was just sitting here minding my own business and all of a sudden I notice that I'm sweating. It's 9 degrees outside and I'm sweating. Wearing a tank top and shorts and still sweating. I had every window open in here and it was still sweltering. The windows have been wide open ever since (god help me if it snows), and it's still above 90 in here. It got up to 97 degrees last night (at which point, I decided to pull out the box fan, tube tops and shorts again) and I felt like my skin was about to melt right off of me. Now, Monday night, three people were here, including myself, and I was the only one that noticed the temperature (I attribute this to the fact that the other two live in the dorms on campus and have no control over their heat and it's been known to be 98 degrees in there year round), but last night, the bf noticed it and was miserable in it. To the point where he, for the first time in almost a month, decided to sleep at his house (where 7 other people, 4 fish, 3 cats, 2 dogs, and a snake live, and annoy him greatly). If this isn't fixed by tonight, my landlord can expect a majorly bitchy phone call. This? Is unacceptable!

      First off, I'm leaving my last entry up here a little longer because I'm not one to actually post daily, and I don't want any of you to miss anything (because I know you think it's SO important, except not).  Now for the real entry I want to post tonight. Here's something completely random that I came across on another message board. Two recent college grads are taking five months to run across the US (from New Jersey to Oregon), without the aid of a support vehicle, carrying all that they'll need on their back and without spending any money on lodging (yes, that means no hotels, no campgrounds, no nothing). They'll be departing Sea Bright, New Jersey on February 23 (that's right, this coming Sunday. In icy cold New Jersey), and are scheduled to arrive in Florence, Oregon on July 22. While I think it'd be a kick ass experience, the chances of me actually doing something like it are pretty much nil (only because I don't have 5 free months to spare right now, and this would be the only feasible time in my life to go on such a trip), but I'd like to help them. Problem is, their route isn't anywhere near me. If you know anyone who can help these guys out (who, from what I hear, are actually very nice people) with a spare floor for a night, they'd be forever grateful. You may also end up being in a documentary (they have two documentarians following their story (one network TV and one cable) and will also be carrying a video camera with them to film on their own. You also most certainly will be listed on their website as contributors to their mission. Here is the list of towns through which they'll be passing. If you or anyone you know live in or near any of the towns listed, please spare a floor or a couch or a bathtub for these guys. What they're doing is really quite amazing.

      I should just stop going to the mailbox. All it does is piss me off and make me want to throw stuff. I'm still debating whether or not to post what it was that pissed me off, so if I decide to post it, I will post it later. I even have it all written out and ready to post. If not, well, I guess you just know that I don't like getting mail that I shouldn't be getting.  later... Okay, I just remembered this and thought I needed to write it down before I forgot about it again. I had the absolute worst dream I've ever had last night(aside from that recurring dream I've had since I was three years old with the strange man's face coming out of the wall and haunting me for my childhood). I had a dream that my boyfriend was hit and killed by a car in the exact same scenario that my sister was hit and killed when we were five. Exact! same! scenario! Same guy driving the car, same paramedics, same reaction out of me (to run over and pick up the lifeless body and scream), same in the fact that I was the only one that witnessed the accident, and same feeling of half of me being ripped out of my body when my sister died. Same. I don't remember dreams very often, but this one rattled me so much that I woke up sobbing and refused to go back to sleep (yes, I've had a total of an hour of sleep today). First of all, the image of my sister dying in front of me has stayed with me since that day, but seeing it play out as two adults and her being replaced with my boyfriend? No wonder I couldn't sleep again. I'm not even tired now, and not because I shouldn't be tired, but because I don't know if I want to sleep for fear of seeing that again.  Guess I'll be playing solitaire until the wee hours again today.

      This is a rant very similar to a rant I posted over at Looking Good, but I thought I'd repeat it over here, you know, seeing as this is my journal and I can do with it what I want. So here it is...  This terror alert thing. I don't get the significance of it at all. I mean, I understand the part where we're supposed to pay attention and beware of a terrorist fucking with us much like they did on 9/11, but what I don't get is the part where the government tells us we need to be "more alert". Yeah, they change the color alert (and really, how stupid do they think we are that they felt the need to color code it), and we're supposed to run out and stockpile water, food and duct tape? Are they serious? First of all, if you don't have duct tape, how can you call yourself an American anyway? Everyone has duct tape, and those that don't? Well, you should be ashamed of yourself. There's one household product that everyone on the planet should have and that, my friends, is DUCT TAPE!  Anyway, back to the original rant. This alert mess. How exactly do you "get more alert"? Does that even make sense? And then follow the government's directions to remain calm and go about business as usual? That makes even less sense. Because how can a person be alert (and for the most part scared out of their friggin mind, as is the case now across the country), and still go about things as usual? You can't. It can't be done. If you're not alert to begin with, you cannot suddenly be alert and be the same. We're humans, not robots or computers where you can upgrade the software with a brand new version that includes the part about being alert. Stupid!  And if you're one of those people that feels the need to stockpile food, water, duct tape and plastic to seal yourself in a room? Make sure it's the bathroom. At some point when whoever-it-is that is supposed to be cleaning up this chemical/biological/radiation mess, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom (if the terror warnings haven't already caused you to shit your pants out of fear). And guess what? While you're in there, you can clean it (which you and I both know you've been putting off until company comes over, because that's what I do). Don't use bleach though, because your new sealed room isn't ventilated at all (remember, terror chemicals can get in if it's not), and you'll end up killing yourself with the fumes. That's right folks, these sealed rooms probably won't have air coming into them (if they're sealed properly), so you'll suffocate. If you plan on keeping the bad chemicals/bioterrorism blah-de-blah whatever out, you'll also have to keep the oxygen from getting in. So if you plan to survive in there, better invest in an oxygen machine, too. And don't think the terrorists don't already know this. If I know this, they know it, too! Anyone with a 3rd grade science class, knows this.   Oxygen is needed to breathe, breath is needed for life, and what's the point of a terror threat if we all plan on suffocating ourselves anyway? Sound stupid to you? Well, it should!

      Here's something I'm less than impressed with. The USA Track & Field association and their random drug testers. Now, I'm not saying I'm opposed to random testing, but there has to be a better way. This morning, not more than 3 seconds before I was off to go meet with a brand new headhunter, I hear a knock on my door. Not having expected this more than two years after my last competition, and forgetting entirely that until I submit the proper forms, I'm still a member of the USATF, I look through the peephole and see some random man wearing a suit and think "hmm, a salesman at 8am? strange". So I opened the door only to find that I have to submit a urine sample in the presence of this person (yeah, that's right, they have to watch me) and I don't get a say in the matter. I explained to the man that I was in a MAJOR hurry and that he could come back in a couple hours and I'd be glad to comply. Nope, he wasn't having it. Either I did it right then and there, or he would tail me until I complied. Well, I had to be at said headhunter's office at 8:15, and I was already pushing it to get there on time, so I chose for him to tail me (pet peeve - being late, no matter the excuse). Have you ever had to explain to some people who have no concept of your sport why there is a man in a suit nearly attached to you with handcuffs? Yeah, it gets some strange looks. But they were entertained by my refusal to be late to an appointment, so that was a plus.  So, I did my little interview/whatever with the headhunter, and then returned to my apartment and peed in the cup (while random-tester-guy watched), handed it to him, signed the paper, and then he left. Here's another question I have for the folks in the random drug tester fraternity. When are you going to send women to test women. I don't know about you all, but I don't enjoy peeing in front of people, let alone a strange man that I've never seen before. Not my idea of a good time. Hell, you need a female tester, I'm volunteering! In fact, I think a letter to them is in order, because I find it unacceptable that they don't send the women to test the women. They're just asking for trouble.  All in all, not an awful experience, but seriously, give me some room, next time send a woman, and next time check your records! I haven't raced competitively in nearly 2 years, and don't plan on competing again in the future (unless some miracle happens and I all of a sudden wake up with a Nike contract). The fun thing about the whole ordeal is that I don't even know if I'll pass the damned drug test. It's not one of those standard illegal substance tests, it's a test for performance enhancing drugs. And since the last time I actually paid attention to the list (which is ridiculously long), there have been additions to it, and who knows if any of those substances are in the vitamins I use, or the power bar I'd just consumed, or in the cough drop I'd just taken. So that'll be fun. Well, I guess if you see me on the two-year-ban list next time you see it, you'll understand why. Oh well.

      Just a little rant out of me today. I'm sorry in advance for those of you that I'll inevitably offend, but something must be said (and it's my journal and I'll say what I want to say)! I don't understand the concept of being a "follower". I mean, really, how hard is it to form your own opinions on things. I don't think it's hard at all, but then again, I'm a bit opinionated, so maybe that's my problem. I suppose there have to be followers in order to have leaders, but maybe we need to focus a little more on trying to get out of that following position and work toward being a leader. Although, if being a leader means that everyone just accepts my opinion and agrees with it because I am a leader, then I don't want to be a leader. I want people to question more things. It just doesn't make sense to me that people don't question things. For instance, I was approached with this little opinion I am supposed to have last night about hating someone who's done nothing to me, and hasn't appeared to me to be a bad/annoying person. She goes about her business and I go about mine. Our paths don't cross. Apparently she argued with someone a long time ago and god forbid anyone like her now. What is that? I live for arguing. I'm good at it. So people are supposed to hate people with alternate opinions now? Why does that sound a little off to me? Maybe it's just me, because apparently, I'm the only person on the planet that doesn't hate this girl. I just simply have no opinion and that bothers people. Which bothers me. Which makes me have a negative opinion of these people (who for the most part, I don't really like anyway, but the one's I do like, I didn't expect this out of). What really bothers me is that this person I'm supposed to hate, is just like most of the people that hate her. She's no different from them. I've seen no evidence that this person couldn't just change her name and be those people. But, because she dared to argue with one of them, they all are just jumping on the "ooh, let's hate her" bandwagon. I have little doubt that I'll be next on their hate list, if this is the criteria. Because I'll be damned if I'm going to just go along with them because it seems like the "in" thing to do. Fuck that! I did take that issue up with one of the people I respect out of that group, and she seemed to understand, so at least there's that. But seriously, we're adults. Let's start acting like it.  Well, anyway, for those of you that know me, you know that my biggest peeve is people who cannot form opinions of their own, and instead just wander around with someone else's thoughts in their head.  And finally, the drama is over. I made a decision. I don't know why I struggled with that so much, because after talking to the ex this morning, I found that he can settle for just being friends (and still survive, and be happy). I also got to talk to Jake quite a bit yesterday and he understands why it was a hard decision for me. He was pissed off about it initially, but he remembered that he did the same thing to me a while back, and knew where I was coming from. History is hard to move beyond, and now that we've both done it, I think things will move forward quite nicely. And actually, I found that last week's little "let's make her jealous" thing actually worked to his advantage. I spent most of this week thinking about what it'd be like to see him with someone else, and know that I was the reason for that. I realized I couldn't live with that, and obviously, I can survive seeing the ex with someone else (as long as she's a kind, decent, caring person), because I've seen it. This is the best decision for me, and I don't lose a thing (well, as long as my sanity doesn't count, because I lost that a long ass time ago).

      Happy birthday, Jamie! Guess what, you're still older than I am! My god, you're 24! What on earth are you gonna do now, geezer?  Alright, prepare yourself for me whining. I do it a lot, but I'm having a pity party, and if you don't want to go, stop reading now. On to the whine. Cheese will be served later. I haven't been sick in nearly a year and a half, so I guess I'm making up for it in the past week. Last week I was inundated with a case of flash vomiting. You know, the one that gives only enough warning for you to haul ass to the bathroom, makes you throw up for about 15 minutes and then is over (and no, it's not morning sickness!). I think it was a case of bad eggs (that'll teach me to eat something I find in the fridge that I didn't remember putting there). Then, last night I woke up with something that can only be described as excessive phlegm with the dry throat mix. Fun. So, I now have a full blown cold, complete with the pressure behind my eyes that makes them feel like they're about to shoot out of my head. Sadly (for me at least), this means I can't get in a full run in the mornings until this mess is gone. Now, for those of you that know me, you know that I don't function properly without it. I feel like a slug. A very woozy slug. Do you think coffee and nyquil is a good mix? It feels kind of like an upper and a downer all at once. I want to sleep, but my eyes won't shut (they'll water, but they won't let me sleep). Oh, and while I'm listing ailments, I have the biggest nastiest blister known to man on my right big toe. Painful and gross. Wonderful combination, really. If I knew it would feel better, and not get worse, I'd drain the damned thing, but in that location, that's a bad idea. It'll get infected and nasty, and then even more gross and painful, so I'll just leave it be. I guess that'll teach me to wear those damned cotton socks when hoofing it around campus. Stupid!  I need a haircut. It's out of control, I tell you! Completely out of control. Static, even when the air isn't dry? That's a new phenomenon. And what's with the highlights all of a sudden getting lighter? Hi, brown hair, where'd you go? And what's going on with my normally oily roots being dry? What's going on? And volume? You can stay, I like you, but the rest of you strange things need to be on your way post haste! And how exactly is it that no matter what direction the wind is from, my hair is always poking me in the eyes and attempting to go up my nose? It stays out of my mouth just fine, which is strange in and of itself, but the rest of it? I just don't get it.  And why is it that this particular week I am craving salty foods instead of chocolate and ice cream? That has NEVER happened before. I'm on this salt kick to the point where I baked a ham with raspberry glaze and steamed vegetables, proceeded to scrape the raspberry glaze off because it was sweet and I didn't want sweet, and then chased the meal with a half of a bag of Doritos (nacho cheese, mmm). And then I've been drinking my coffee without sugar or that wondrous french vanilla coffeemate creamer. Just straight up black coffee. I don't drink my coffee black. Ever. And my hot chocolate mix (homemade and the best shit ever), has gone untouched for nearly 10 days now. I usually have a cup every day.  And what's up with my jewelry breaking me out? And the lemon scented Mr. Clean stuff I use to clean the sink not smelling good to me? And my scented hand lotion that I love, making my head hurt from the smell? And my antibacterial hand soap making my hands soft and smooth instead of dry and rough? And my room freshener all of a sudden being so odiferous that I had to move it out of the room? And me sleeping on my left side instead of my right, and not being comfortable any other way? And the heat in my building all of a sudden not bothering me with it's, well, excessive production of heat? And petroleum jelly all of a sudden not removing my eye makeup? And me all of a sudden calling up and talking to my family just because I'm bored? And me all of a sudden not waking up at 5:52am on the dot (this has been happening for the past 5 months or so, and I got used to it)?  Okay, so who turned the universe on its head and why didn't I get the memo? My life secretary is SO fired!

      Ah, the wonders of college and all it's group-work bullshit. Why am I bringing this up nearly two years post-graduation, you might ask? Well, someone on a message board I frequent was talking about a bad group experience. I think we all have them, don't we? Yeah, pretty sure we do. Here's the story at the top of my shitty group work experience list. It was a system analysis/design class my junior year of college. Four group members, only one of which had any sense of normal to her. The first fight we had was the first day we met. It was because one of the group members likes to be in bed by 10pm, and I absolutely could not meet (ever) until 9pm or later (unless they wanted to meet at 5am. no one took me up on that). Here's why: 6am-7am weight room, 7am-9am work 9am-noon class, noon-2pm track practice, 2pm-4pm volleyball practice, 4pm-9pm work (unless of course it was Wednesday, in which case, I had class from 7pm-10pm). Weekends consisted of me on an athletic away trip of some sort, and those that didn't involved me working or studying. Sundays were all day work. So yeah, I could not meet until 9pm or later. Well, this girl that was having a fit about it decided to stop coming to meetings. Then she decided she didn't have to do anything at all. Then she decided to complain to the professor that I was a bitch and that I refused to meet before 9pm and that just didn't work for her. Now, what this fool didn't anticipate was that I had been (and still was) working in the office directly across the hall from the professor for nearly three years. She knew that there was no way I could re-arrange my schedule for a meeting (she also knew that I wouldn't be in the actual class very often because I would be out of town a whole lot, and since she knew I'd know the material when I needed to know it, she didn't care). Then the final presentation rolls around. Keep in mind this presentation involves about 70% of our final grade, and the whole group is to get the grade. Idiot group member shows up (I'd emailed her everything she needed to know for the presentation, including, but not limited to, a typed out version of exactly what she was supposed to say) in jeans and a t-shirt (for a formal business presentation). She proceeds to fumble through her portion of the presentation, turning around at three different points to apologize to me (as if it was me determining the group grade), and then handed the PowerPoint clicker off to me. Now, public speaking is not one of my strong suits. I hate it actually, but damn if I didn't bullshit my way through that mess. And then I hand it off to the rest of the group. Well, one of the other two knew what she was doing. The other one? Hadn't even looked over his notes for the presentation and fumbled some more. At this point, the prof turned and looked at me with complete sympathy and told me later that she was surprised that I didn't just walk out. I wanted to, believe me, I did. I ended up catching up with the professor later in the day and sat down with her and let her know exactly who had been doing the work out of our group. Let's just say that two of us got out with A's, and the other two were in that class the next semester. The next semester I was in a class with the one that didn't ever show up to meetings, and she found me the first day and let me have it. Well, up until I pointed out (along with 5 other people who happened to be in that class for the final presentation) how very little she'd done and how very lucky she was that I didn't rip her eyeballs out at the time. Those five people (whom I'd never spoken with before) that had been in that class and saw the presentation said that watching that presentation from that class was painful. They also said I looked like I was about to drill the two idiots with my fist. They also mentioned that it was a nice save on my part and on the part of the other girl throughout the mid-section of the presentation (where all the meat of the information was), and that was nice to hear, but the beginning and ending were positively dreadful. So that's my hellish group story. There were many, many more bad group stories, but nothing compared to this one.  Remember how last week I said I wasn't going to give my thoughts on the war, and then did it anyway? Well, it turned out that many more people than I thought think that what I said was right on, and, um, thanks for agreeing with me, I guess? For those of you who expressed your disagreement with my thoughts, well, I'm sorry, and I won't argue with you. This is America and we're entitled to think whatever we want, and I, for one, will not be holding a giant debate over the ins and outs of my thinking. I don't have to defend my thoughts to you, or anyone, and those emails requesting me to do so will likely not get a response. That is, unless you're one of my friends. But just for the sake of clarity, I'm going to reiterate my thoughts once more, and that will most likely be it (unless, of course, I have another thought on the subject). I think the force being used in Iraq is necessary and that as citizens, we need to stop the protests and stand behind our government and present a unified front. We also need to admit that no matter how much we think we know, we don't know enough to judge whether this is right or wrong. Just because this is America doesn't mean that our government should give us every scrap of information related to this war. It's safer that they don't. Just understand that they probably are doing the right thing, whether we like it or not. And if you run into any military personnel, please be kind to them, even if you don't agree with what they're fighting for. They're the reason you are allowed to express your opinions in the first place. I'd also like to say that celebrities need to just shut up. Entertainment and politics should not go hand-in-hand. And Michael Moore? Go to hell! Yes, I understand that you're not a supporter of the war, and that you think Bush is an idiot. I think he's an idiot, too, but the Academy Awards is not the time or the place for you to declare that our country's leadership is a scam. You, sir, are a film maker. You are not a politician. If you want things in Washington to change, run for office. If you think America sucks (which is how you came off), then get the fuck out! We don't need you, even if you think the world revolves around you. I can assure you that it does not. Take a lesson from Adrien Brody and learn some tact, because that display on stage at the Oscars, was just utterly distasteful. Your movie was deserving of the Oscar, and congrats on that, but really, you are a grown ass man. Learn when to speak up and when not to. The Oscars is a time you should have kept that verbal spewing to yourself. The troops overseas were watching that. They're the ones that fight for you to be able to have that right to spew your thoughts freely. They don't need to hear you telling the world that what they're doing is invalid! It is most certainly not invalid. You go spouting on and on about freedom of speech, yet you seem to have missed the part where the coalition forces are trying to help the citizens of Iraq obtain that same right. So, Michael Moore, why don't we send you to Iraq and let Saddam and his buddies have you killed because you dared to speak your mind. Here, here's one giant can of shut the hell up. Enjoy.

      So much happening this week. SO MUCH! Two new jobs plus another interview (which I think went decent, but will not speculate on, because as soon as I get excited about such things, I don't get the job), avoidance of a potentially miserable financial and legal situation, I found out some sort of sad news from home, March Madness began, and the US is at war. I'd wager to say that in the last 4 days, more has happened that will weigh into how my life is than has happened in the past 5 months.  Let's start with these new jobs. Both of the new ones are fairly simple jobs (or seem that way at the moment). One is creating a farm management system so that the clients are able to use reports and forms much easier than typing one up every time they need one. Simple stuff. In fact, I scraped this job up last night and am done with something already that they didn't expect until mid-April. Just waiting on some graphics from them now. The second job I just ran into this afternoon. Well, actually, it landed on my voice mail and how it landed there is still a mystery. I'm going to be helping edit music videos. How cool is that? Pretty damned cool, especially when you think that I'm in the middle of nowhere and people here don't make music videos. Ever. So this really could be fun. I'll find out more about this (and the person that called to hire me) tomorrow afternoon and will probably have something to say at the beginning of next week, as I'm headed home this weekend to see the family.  Which leads me into the sort of sad news from home. My grandparent's had a house fire a few weeks ago (I'd have written about it sooner, but I wasn't aware of it until last night. As always, I'm the last to know). Health-wise, everyone is fine, and the house is structurally fine, but from the sounds of it, the smoke damaged pretty much everything. My grandparents have some of the most beautiful antique furniture, and one day some of it was to be mine, and for sentimental reasons, I really hope it's all able to be salvaged. Especially the red velvet love seat. I love that thing. It's tall on all sides and has mahogany claw feet and this luxurious red velvet. It goes with nothing in anyone's house, but it's something that most anyone would be happy to have because it's just that gorgeous of a piece of furniture. There's also a lot of other things in that house that the rest of my family probably didn't think to keep (because it really isn't worth much, but it's stuff that means something to me), so I really hope they haven't tossed it out yet. So I will be helping with that all day Saturday, I'm sure. It sounds like it's pretty bad, so I'm going in with the mindset that everything is ruined and hoping that I'll be surprised.   Okay, let's discuss March Madness. Let's also discuss how Southern Illinois was robbed by the officials in the first round against Missouri. That last foul was most certainly a foul, but it was an offensive foul! And the asshats in the stripes called it like they wanted to see it. And when you call a time out with 2.6 seconds left, that doesn't mean the clock should run down to 1.5 seconds. And I'm pretty sure that's right there in the idiot manual to running the clock. Thanks, referees for screwing up my Midwest bracket SO early on this year. I appreciate it so very much! JERKS! And BYU? They screwed you over with where they put you in the brackets because if you won round one and two, you'd end up in a Friday/Sunday game, which if you don't know, playing on a Sunday is forbidden in the Mormon church. So what does BYU do with the potential to give a big fuck you to the committee? They lose. Think that's the way to get their attention? Yeah? Well, you're wrong. You just saved their collective asses. One of the biggest screw-ups in NCAA tournament history, and you just let 'em go on with life as usual. You could have done better than that! And NC State? Way to make all those people who claim the ACC is the best conference ever anywhere proud *dripping in sarcasm*. I hate the ACC and all of it's member schools, and yet I gave NC State the benefit of the doubt (mostly because I also hate PAC-10 schools for the most part, and the opponent was Cal). So yeah, way to mess up the East. At least Oklahoma didn't let me down, seeing as I had them kicking your ass on Saturday. At least Gonzaga and Marquette fought the hard fight and won. And you know what, I hope Marquette beats the living shit out of Missouri on Saturday. Know why? Because I hate Missouri and they shouldn't have been in round two anyway. And since I figured Southern Illinois to make the Sweet 16, it makes no difference who wins this game, but for reasons just stated, Missouri should be packing their shit and heading back to Columbia by Sunday morning! No, I'm not at all obsessed with this tournament. Why do you ask?  And bringing it down a whole heap of notches, I just hope that everyone stays as safe as they can be with the war going on in Iraq. I have friends over there and I want them to come back safely. To my old college roommate who is stationed somewhere in Kuwait, please keep yourself safe. And to her little brother who will be shipping out to parts unknown in the very near future, please keep yourself safe, too. Your mother already lost one child, and she wants you both back safely. So do a lot of people. Just one more request for the both of you. If you happen to come into personal contact with Saddam, will you please kick him squarely in the nuts for making me have to worry about the two of you. Then shoot him and give Dubya a call so we can end this war quickly.  I would weigh in with my thoughts on the war and all of that, but I don't feel like discussing it, and I also don't feel like being ridiculed by others for my thoughts on it. So I will just say that I think this is necessary and that as citizens, we need to stop the protests and stand behind our government and present a unified front. We also need to admit that no matter how much we think we know, we don't know enough to judge whether this is right or wrong. Just because this is America doesn't mean that our government should give us every scrap of information related to this war. It's safer that they don't. Just understand that they probably are doing the right thing, whether we like it or not. And if you run into any military personnel, please be kind to them, even if you don't agree with what they're fighting for. They're the reason you are allowed to express your opinions in the first place.

      Ah, the one year anniversary of my ultimate decision to get the hell out of a bad situation and come home. Strange how this mini city where I spent four long years and complained about it for at least three of those years is now a place I can call home and be happy about it. It has it's own little charms to it, that you really don't even notice until you leave. Driving up 58 and rounding that curve and being greeted with a campus that can really only be described as perfect. From the giant white meca peeking out of the background where I spent every day of the four years I'd spent here in the past, to the campanile where the clock is always at least 20 minutes fast or slow depending on the day of the week, to the red roofs of the buildings where I spent so very much time. I missed it. I never thought I would, but I did. The first time I came back after moving away, I knew I missed it. It was the only time in my life that I drove into a town and knew I was home. It's a strange peace that you feel as soon as you see the familiar sites and smell the familiar smells. The cherry blossoms on the boulevard near campus. The sun setting behind the trees on the west side. The fresh air smell that seems to be lacking anywhere else in the world. Ah, I'm home. People are always so eager to leave. So set on getting out of this town and this state, but once you do, it's undeniable that you miss it. I don't know anyone who doesn't miss parts of it. Not a single person. And anyone who has left who comes back here to visit, still has that look on their face when they come back. That "I'm comfortable here" look. I've tried to describe this feeling to people who have yet to leave, and they all think I'm nuts. None of them understand why I came back, especially since I was one of the biggest "I'm getting the hell out of here the first chance I get" people. They don't understand it because they haven't yet experienced it. I have no doubt that they'll get it some day. Until then, I'll just keep my comfortable happiness to myself.   It's funny, though, because this exact day a year ago was the day that I rolled into town and felt that feeling. The next morning I was looking for a place to live and within 20 minutes I'd found THE place! You know the one. You walk in and just know. You walk in and can just visualize yourself and your things in the apartment and know it's the place you're going to take. And then for the part that can kill that feeling, no matter how much you want the place. They tell you the price and how much the deposit is. The landlady told me the price and it was half (!!!) of what I was paying for a cramped two bedroom apartment that I hated (and hated the roommates that went along with it, along with the city in which it was located). And the heat was included (if you're not from the north or midwest, you don't understand the value of this, but trust me, it's essentially like winning the lottery)! So with one signature I cut my monthly expenses by about 75%. And I was going to be where I wanted to be. I was going to be home.  The best part of the whole thing? Getting to tell my old roommate that instead of throwing out her fiancé every other week (because he pulled some shit that should have got his ass arrested and her and their friends along with him) that I was going to transfer my portion of the lease to him because I couldn't stand him, her, their friends, or their habits. The lovely part about that was that he'd not been paying his share of the rent for the past 4 months, and instead I'd been picking up the slack on that (because as much as I hate them both, I wasn't about to get evicted because of their stupidity). My roommate tried to pull some fake tears out of herself, but she knew as well as I did that they were fake. And if they weren't? Well, I don't even care. That bitch made my life suck for far too damned long for me to give a shit about abandoning her with her idiot fiancé. As I was pulling away in the U-Haul 2 weeks later, I stopped at the office of the complex and let them know the deal and told them to wait a week and then do an apartment inspection up in that place and see what kind of illegal shit they find. They were evicted two weeks after I left, and sure, I took a loss on the security deposit, but it was worth it to find them both out on their ass (or better, living in the smallest basement on the planet). It was also amusing when my old roommate was arrested and used her one phone call to call me. Bad choice out of her.  See, if you don't know me, you probably also don't know that once you make a bad impression on me, you're done. You piss me off, it's over. One bad experience with you and I'm not dealing with you again. I don't have time for people and their bullshit. You stick around for that kind of crap, and you're bound to get burned more than once, and I'm not having it. I've been burned enough, and I'm not gonna put myself in the fire again. I'm just not. So when this girl called me from the clink asking me to bail her out and not call her father because he'd hate her, the first thing I did was call her father. That fool gave me attitude, too, because for some reason it was my fault that his daughter was a dumbass and thought she was above the law (apparently she spent a great deal of time spreading some fairly vicious lies about me to her family and friends). So with that, I told him that his daughter was in jail and she asked me not to call him and then hung up. Washed my hands of the situation and let her family deal with her.  But lets be real here. Who the hell calls an old roommate who blatantly hates you (and made it quite obvious, and the feeling was mutual) when you need help getting out of a jam? Why didn't she call her fiancé? Oh, wait, because he doesn't have any money and he wouldn't know what to do even if she had called him. Either that or he was in the cell right next to her. Sometimes the shadiness and stupidity of people just amazes me.  There have been a handful of shady people amazing me lately. People trying to act nice, but you know before they open their mouth that their intentions are not what they claim them to be. Like someone not being somewhere for weeks (when for quite a while they'd been there regularly) and then out of nowhere, they show up. And it happens to be after some other shady things had gone down with some other people who you know this person has contact with on a daily basis. It's amusing how they think you don't know that their reasons for being there are not what they'd like you to believe. It's also amusing how very little some people pay attention to what you notice and still try to pull one over on you. Do they really think they have a chance of me not realizing the shadiness of their actions? God help you if you're standing in front of me when you're trying to pull some shady shit, because I'll call you on it and make your ass cry like an infant. People don't pull shit with me and get away with it. They just don't. People that know me, know that. Without a doubt, they know it. And they know it because they've seen it. They don't want to be on the receiving end of me going off. What's funny is that some of my online friends (I distinguish this because they are entirely different sets of people, and they are just that. online friends. they won't be leaving the ranks of online friends. that's just how it is. they also don't know me well enough, or I them, to be brought into my inner circle. just the way it is) don't seem to understand that even online I can distinguish between shady actions and genuine actions. Some shady shit has been going down lately with this group of online people. Some claims of shit that went on that I know didn't happen because logically, it never could have. Some people claiming to send shit that never actually got sent and knowing that the people claiming they sent the stuff never sent it because they're just trying to lie their way out of a potentially confrontational situation. Funny thing about lies though. They can come back and bite you on the ass at some point. Usually when you're least expecting it.  There's another thing about the online community that I question at times. Not the validity of it, but how people who are online every hour they're awake actually accomplish anything. Wouldn't employers kind of frown on this? I know I'd have fired at least a couple people by now. Maybe these jobs that these people have aren't very strenuous, but when those same people complain about how much they had to do at work, I question how much more they could have gotten done had they not been chatting all day. Sure, chat every now and then. Everyone needs little breaks throughout the day to break up the monotony of work, but all day long? That's just unacceptable behavior for any employee I'd ever hire. Wait. I wouldn't ever hire these people. I am able to recognize people who have common sense and people who don't. The people without it, wouldn't be hired by me. The people with it, would know that chatting all day on the company dime will get your ass fired. And if it doesn't get your ass fired, it sure as hell won't lead to a pay raise or a promotion.  That's pretty much all I have to say for now. I guess that's actually quite a bit, seeing as I haven't written in a while. I'm sure you didn't even notice.

      I'm having one of those days. The one where nothing feels right, everything that comes out of my mouth seems like it makes no sense. Everything coming out of everyone else's mouth seems to make no sense, either. I'm all jittery and bored, but have no motivation. I don't want to do anything, but I don't want to do nothing. Just one of those days that everything seems just a little bit off.  I've seen all these people today, just going about their business as usual and looking content and happy while doing so. I wanted to stop some of them and ask them how to do that. I know how to do it. I'm usually one of those people. But today seems different. Like something has changed completely. Like someone flipped a switch and everything I knew is now different. I know, I'm being melodramatic, again. But you get my point. Seriously, though, something deep down inside me feels different. I'm not at all comfortable with anything today.  Maybe it's the weather. The first big storms of the spring/summer rolled through last night, so it's a little muggy and overcast. Although I don't recall feeling like this in years past at this particular time, so maybe it's not the weather. The birds outside my window seem perfectly happy, judging by the level of noise coming out of them. Pretty, but enough already! They're making my ears hurt, they're so loud.  I'm also feeling the need to yell at absolutely everyone. I don't even need a reason. I haven't actually yelled at anyone, yet, but that's not to say that I won't at some point today. The boyfriend is still being irrational and stupid and digging shit up from a couple years ago to be mad about (all stuff that we'd worked through and gotten past. Or so I thought). I'd really like him to come to his senses soon, because I hate not having him around. I've tried talking to him and left feeling insulted and angry. Which doesn't happen with him, so maybe he's not the person I thought he was. Maybe this is really him. People have a knack for changing on me and then turning on me, and then somehow making it my fault that they're different.  On top of all of this, Mother's Day is coming up. Now, ordinarily, you wouldn't think anyone would hate this holiday. Guess what, I'm far from ordinary. I would rank this one right up there with one of the worst holidays. My mother has made being cruel to me a sport. She'd win a medal if there were medals to be won. But still, I feel the need to be civil to her. Because she's family, and that's what I'm supposed to do. I do a lot of things I'm supposed to do when it comes to family. There is exactly one person in my family who has ever been kind to me without motive, and he catches heat for it every time he does. When is Grandfather's Day again? Oh, we just lump that one in with Father's Day (which, ironically, I don't have a problem with, because my dad doesn't have enough time in the day to worry about being cruel to me. He just doesn't say anything to me at all, and he doesn't expect gifts, cards, big ordeals on any holiday or birthday).  I keep seeing all of these commercials telling us that our mothers are great and that we should give them something special for mother's day. They make me sad. The inevitable Oprah special on wonderful mothers. That makes me sad, too. I wish I could say that my mother is wonderful and always took care of me, and always looked out for me. She didn't. Simple as that. She's made no secret that she doesn't like me. She's made no secret that she'd trade me with someone else, if she could. She's never said it, but I get the feeling that she wishes both of her daughters had been killed. Or at least me instead of my sister. Sounds harsh, I know, but some of you know my mother, and you know that this could very well be true. But now that I think about it, if I wasn't around, who would she be mean to? She's not that way to any other human being on this planet. In fact, the rest of the world sees her as a very kind, giving, nurturing woman. She has them all fooled. Well, not so much fooled, I guess, as she is actually that way to my brother. I wonder, sometimes, what all the rest of those people think about me. They probably think I'm an ungreatful little bitch. But ungreatful for what? What did I ever get from her to be greatful for? Okay, so she gave birth to me. Thanks, mom. Except if she really wants my thanks for that, maybe she could treat me like she doesn't regret it.  So why do I get sad at all those sappy Mother's Day specials and commercials? Because I wish that just once I felt that connection with my mom where I felt the need to celebrate it. I never have. I wish that just once she did something for me out of the kindness of her heart. She never has. I wish that just once she could treat me like she treats everyone else and not like the mistake she thinks I am.

      Someone told me I should post all of my work escapades, because they're funny reading, so I took her advice and here's the latest installment. This is from the last 10 minutes of my day at Crazy's yesterday.  Note to Crazy: If you tell me what your day's schedule is like, maybe you wouldn't have to tell me we're in a hurry all the time. Yes, I am always on time, but only if I know what time to be wherever it is that I need to be. You don't tell me at 3:52 that you are supposed to meet a student on campus at 4:00. You live 12 minutes (when I'm speeding and there are no stoplights or traffic) from campus. What's that? You have a package that needs to go out today from FedEx? Oh, well, I'll just turn back time and make sure it gets to the FedEx drop by 4pm. Nevermind it is across town and I have to take you to campus first. Nevermind it's 8 minutes to 4. No, I'm a miracle worker, I can do it. I'm superwoman! Sure, we can stop at the computer store to pick up a new mouse. No problem. I'll just put time on pause for about 20 minutes and we'll get there no problem.  Oh, you want me to drag that dry cleaning (the same dry cleaning I dragged up the stairs the other day, complete with a left shoulder that felt like it was being set on fire and stabbed all at once, but no worries. you not hurting yourself is FAR more important than me not hurting myself anymore than I already am) back to the closet? Why didn't you tell me that when I was dragging the shit upstairs the other day? "No, we can just leave it sit here on the kitchen floor and Charlie will take care of it." Okay, so why didn't he take care of it? I saw him there, he was eating a bowl of soup. He didn't look too busy to put away the damn dry cleaning. And Charlie? Let's not egg me on by asking why we haven't left yet, because we're going to be late. That will only lead to me hitting you in the head with my fist. Okay? Good. Why is it that you, Charlie, can't drag your wife to campus? You're not doing anything at all today. I'm pretty sure those are flannel pants I see you wearing, and that it's clear you slept in that tshirt. Oh, and when I'm pounding on the door with my head because I have both hands full of her crap, could you maybe tear yourself away from the television and open the door? That'd be great.  Oh, what's that, Crazy? You want me to find your blue pants for you? Any idea where they are? Oh, they're in the closet. Okay. Oh, you want me to bring you a blue shirt to go with them? You do realize these don't look at all good together, right? You do? Well, then why are you wearing them together? With your ugly black Nikes. And white socks. You realize you embody the very image of a pain in the ass professor, right? Oh, you do, well, at least you know it. What's that, Charlie? You need a sandwich? Um, get off your ass and get it yourself. I don't work for you, so fuck off.  Okay, it's 3:59 now, you think you're ready to go yet? Oh, you are? Oh, you haven't combed your hair yet? Um, you do know that nobody can tell, right? You look like that all the time. Okay, let's go. We ready? We are? Are you sure? Oh, you have a garbage bag of things for me to take to campus with you? Okay, yeah, we can do that. Why do people carry their non-garbage items in garbage bags? I just don't get it. It's not garbage, but if it's in a big black garbage bag, it's going in the garbage. Buy some luggage, or a nice shoulder bag or something. Because that would make sense. Oh, nevermind, you don't ever make sense. No, Charlie, I am not bringing you a sandwich. No, Charlie, when I take her to school and get her other errands done, I'm going home. Where people are sane. Yes, Charlie, you're going to have to make your own sandwich tonight.

      Happy Birthday (tomorrow), Janel! Damn, I feel old. Last time I checked, you were still 5 years old. That was 10 years ago. Stop growing up, damnit!  Alright, all home from the great easter weekend of 2003. I arrived home shortly after 6 this evening and brought with me some leftovers, a shitty haircut courtesy of mother, and the worst backpain I've ever encountered. All in all, a pretty decent weekend as far as weekends at home go.  The haircut was my own fault in a round-about sort of way. She mentioned that she'd learned a new trick for cutting layered hair and wanted to try it out on me. I said (last time I was home) that maybe she could try it next time I was home. Well, she actually remembered me saying that (she usually pays no attention when I talk), and sat me down in the chair and got the hair cutting cape out on Saturday morning. By that point, it's too late to protest. So she cut it. It looks alright when I go to the trouble of actually doing something to it (like curling the top layer under and the bottom layer out to hide the obviousness of the "hey, you have exactly two layers in here and they're obvious" look). I prefer just drying my hair and leaving it be after that, but with this cut, I have to get out styling products and tools and scaffolding and other sorts of things. I'll have to start saving my parking money to get this fixed by someone who knows how. At least it's still long enough to pull it back. Barely. Apparently three inches to regular people is one inch to her. I requested no more than an inch be cut off. The pile on the floor indicated a solid three inches had been lopped off (although, there were shorter pieces, but I assume that's from layer number two: the long underside layer).  The backpain is a complete mystery to me. I was sitting in church (yeah, I know. I only go on holidays when I'm home, so don't worry, I haven't gone all religious on you) and noticed a twinge of pain right under my shoulder blade on the left side. Throughout the day, it got worse and worse and worse until when I went to bed last night, I could not lay in any position and not feel as though I was being stabbed (which greatly reduced my sleep time). I've tried stretching it, getting it massaged, heat, ice, Icy Hot, heat and massage all at once, hot shower, cold shower, and ibuprofin. It still hurts, and it hurts more now than it did last night. Mom told me she could literally see the knot sticking out of my back, but she couldn't work it out. I may not like her much, but the woman can rub out a knot when a massage therapist is not on hand. I even tried her parafin wax melty thingy (descriptive enough? I think so). No help. I guess it's time to see the good doctor this week to see what he can do for me. Muscle relaxers would be helpful, maybe? I don't know. Every once in a while, I feel the muscle grab and tighten around my ribs in the front, so I think this knot is just trying to gather strength to be the biggest muscle knot in the guiness book of world records or something. You know, like they do with the biggest ball of aluminum foil. Hopefully this goes away soon. I have things to do. Like lug Crazy's crap around. And I can't do that with a bum shoulder/back.  Tonight some people and I got into a discussion of past roommate experiences. Some people were telling their sob stories about one or two bad roommates. I must be an attraction for bad roommates. They flock to me. Let's see. The first roommate I had took a shit in my closet on the first night she spent in our very first dorm room. And no, it wasn't a water closet. She moved out the next day (per my request, but she later dropped out to get some psychological help, which I believe was probably much needed). So a week later roommate number two shows up. She spent every second of every minute she was in our room on the phone with her boyfriend. You see, this guy had figured out how to get through his college's phone system so he didn't have to pay for long distance. This meant I got no calls. None at all. About a million voice mail messages, but never ever did I get to pick up the phone and have it be for me. Oh, and she liked to turn on the television as soon as she entered the room. To porn. And she liked to hide the remote. And she routinely left snot remnants in the sink after she blew a snot rocket in there (not that I'm against snot rockets, but rinse them down the sink, please). And snot on the walls. And snot in a lot of random places. And she wore a fragrance (purposely) that smelled like old people at a nursing home. And she never heard her alarm in the morning, and it went off for like 90 minutes before I'd have to get up and shut it off (and to do so, I'd have to crawl across our loft into her bed and over her to shut it off. annoying).  Eventually the phone scheme was put to an end after he got caught and was served with a $2000 phone bill. She, to this day, doesn't know this, but I was the one that called her boyfriend's university and turned him in. I'd had enough. Him being rude to me on the phone (asking me why the hell I was answering the phone in my own room, and then telling me to just fucking put her on the phone) was one thing, but when he showed up one weekend and demanded that I stay elsewhere so they could have the whole room to themselves was another thing entirely. The day he demanded I leave was the very day I looked up the department of residence at his school and gave them a call. The lady I talked to was very greatful because they'd been trying to pinpoint the location of those calls for quite some time. I explained to her the whole scheme (because said roommate was stupid enough to give me details), and told her that if she couldn't find the addresses of the person she needed to call me back.  She did, and left the most hilarious voicemail I've ever received. I'd told her she'd get my voicemail because they're on the phone nearly 21 hours a day, and the other three are spent sleeping. The message started with roaring laughter and her telling me she's been trying the roommate's number (two numbers, but both to the same room, so they rang on the same phone, but had two different voice mailboxes) every few hours for about 2 months and kept getting her voicemail, and now she understood why (apparently the computers spit out the number called, but never the number, length or time of the calls, so they didn't realize how long these calls were). She also said that my voicemail message cracked her up. At the time it was this...  "Hey, I'm here. No. Really. I am. You just can't talk to me right now because seargent phone thief is using it. She's ALWAYS using it. You can reach me by mail. But not email. Because i can't get to that either. Because. She's using it. You could come over. But don't knock too loud. She doesn't want to miss a word out of her lovely moron's mouth. And don't mind the stolen porn on the tv. You get used to it after a while. Oh, and if you have a question that requires me to think, you might want to find me and get me the hell out of this room, otherwise I don't know the answer. If you've called 47 times today and I haven't returned your call yet, I'm sorry. I want to. I probably don't know you called yet, but I promise I'm excited and enthused to return your call. I might know you called sometime next century. Whenever she gets off the phone. If you've lasted this far into my message, you really want to talk to me, so really, leave a message and I swear I'll call you back as soon as psycho goes to class or dies. Whichever comes first."  ...The lady said it was the most defeated and hilarious voicemail message she'd ever heard. She had all her coworkers listen to it and they were all cracking up. Anyway, they busted him and the next year he transferred to our school. She broke up with him for being too clingy. She was a moron.  Roommate number three was another random roommate. She was a freshman. I was a sophomore. She (Jeana) was (and is) the sweetest human being alive. She's our little soldier now. Best. Roommate. Ever! After we'd finished rooming together in the dorms, we'd planned on living together in a place off campus, but her financial aid got all messed up and tuition went up and she decided to do some military things to pay for school instead and took a year off from college. So I moved into a house with a few of my friends. Actually, I moved in right after school (I'd planned on taking a month or two off and doing my own thing, but a co-worker of mine had committed suicide and they needed me in the office ASAP, so I got a week off after classes and then started right back in). At the time there was three people in the house. One girl (Mary) was going to be staying on as my roommate, but the other two were subleasing from the other two girls who would move back in August. Katie (one of the subleasers) was a trip. She was the strangest thing I'd ever encountered. She was not the brightest apple on the tree, and was actually only getting by in life on looks (and I'd seen her before she put herself together. Not good). Anyway, she was weird, but Mary and I kind of joined forces to point and laugh at her every chance we got. The other one (Jill somethingorother, I don't remember her last name, but I remember it was funny. Why do last names matter, you ask? Well, coming up, you'll be introduced to another Jill) was only there for a month. Although we stored her shit for the better part of 18 months after that. Free of charge.  Anyway, those two didn't last long (Katie was gone after the summer) and our actual roommates moved in. Jill and Kathy. Jill is one of my best friends to this day, but Kathy really didn't appreciate that very much, so she successfully got us to fight quite often. Kathy wasn't ever one of my favorite people, but the word hate certainly applied to her at the time (she's not so bad if you don't have to live with her). She'd tell Jill things that simply weren't true, and after a while, Jill bought it. This was about October, and about this time Mary and I had had enough of each other. She had never been one of my favorite people, either, but over the summer we kind of hung out because we felt like the puddle of normal in the sea of morons. Mary started hanging out with Kathy, too, and I lost interest in dealing with any of them. It was an unpleasant 8 months after that as we tried to figure out who was going to stay and who was going to go. Eventually Kathy found some other people to bother and decided she'd go. And by eventually, I mean the end of April. And she was moving out April 30 (she still had to pay her rent for the rest pf the lease). Our lease ended at the end of May. We scrambled and tried to get Jeana (because, seriously, everyone loves this girl), but she'd already committed to live with her little brother (another of our country's soldiers) in a tiny apartment near campus since neither of them had a car. Actually, it was their parents' idea because they didn't want little Jimmy living with any irresponsible people and making the opportunity to blow off school less likely (oh, if they only knew). In this time, Jill and I made up and were all fine again. Mary, on the other hand, was annoying the hell out of both of us.  Jana moved in during May to use up Kathy's last month of rent (she needed a place to stay. She was Kathy's friend. I didn't like her from before, so we just steered clear of each other). We finally found someone to take the 4th spot on the lease, but were going to have to eat the fourth portion of the rent because this person refused to pay over the summer since she was already in a place until August. Until Jeana stepped in to save the day. She got a summer job up here, so she came and lived with us for the summer and damn were we sad to see her go when August came. And she was sad to leave. The three of us had a LOT of fun (Mary was doing a summer thing at the U of Minnesota), but she had a lease to honor with her brother. We found out later they could have gotten out of it and both moved in with us. That would have been fine with all of us, as the place they lived was a major shit hole.  So August rolls around and in comes Julie. Oh, Julie. This was trouble from day one. She walked in and moved all kinds of things in with her. She was a little Korean girl who had been living in LA until about 6 months prior to moving in with us. She had the most crap I've ever seen one person have. Why she didn't just get a place of her own is a mystery to me. She also brought with her the strangest, worst smell I've ever had to smell in my life. Not just any smell. A BO kind of smell. And she shared a bathroom with me. She was pretty sure that she knew everything better than the rest of us. She was the loudest, most inconsiderate person we'd encountered in a very long time. Jill and I had never met this girl, but she'd been in school with Mary, so that's where she came from.  There were electricity problems (she brought a space-heater with her, and a rice cooker, and a million other little appliances she kept in her bedroom and blew fuses every morning), bathroom problems (the drains were always plugged with something or other), space problems (our place was huge, but apparently not big enough for her and all her crap), noise problems (she slammed every door she ever came in contact with) and scheduling problems. You see, she had class at 8. I had class at 8. I asked her what time she had to be in the bathroom in the morning. She'd give me a time and decide instead of waiting for her to get done (which sometimes didn't happen until 7:55 and it took 10 minutes to get to campus), I'd go first and get out of her way before then, and she knew this. So, I'd wake up at 6 or earlier to get done and out of the way. Unfortunately, she either didn't remember, didn't care, or whatever, but either she or her boyfriend were ALWAYS in the bathroom when I NEEDED to be in there. And I could have used the bathroom upstairs, but then I'd be in THEIR way. After about 6 months of this, I took my stuff into my room and just went to campus to get showered and ready in the locker rooms. So much easier than dealing with this idiot.  Unfortunately, some days getting to campus was a lot easier said than done. We had a four car driveway. Two in front, two in back. Well, she never really grasped the concept that she shouldn't park behind anyone if she wasn't sure whether or not they had to leave before her. And she never parked in the "spot". She parked squarly in the middle of the driveway. So that meant that NEITHER car in front of her could get out. And instead of hanging her keys by the door like the rest of us did, she took them into her room and stashed them in her bag. I was in a bad mood one morning and nudged her car onto the grass with the monster rubber bumper on my car (it was an old old cavalier with a big rubber bumper all the way around it). She never noticed, since she was in an accident every other week, so her car was pretty dented anyway. One of my friends (who was also living next door to us) was outside getting ready to leave at the time. He said that as soon as I walked out the door and saw that car sitting there he knew I was going to just hit it. He said he was going to offer me a ride, but decided to watch and laugh instead. Jill watched me from the window of the house as well, and rumor has it, she did it the next day using the same tactic. We got to be quite comical for the neighbors. It was like "let's see which one of them rams the car next. We all took a couple cracks at it until we finally stole a parking baracade from campus and just put it in the driveway before she got home every day. She continually became more and more annoying as the days went on and finally our lease was up. All of us were graduating except her, so we all headed for other places and didn't even bother wondering where she was going.  So, that's the end of the roommates in college, and as we all know, they got worse after, so now I have no roommates. I'm very happy about that. Roommates can be evil, evil people. Jeana was the only roommate that never pissed me off, and Jill and I worked out our issues a long time ago (the day Kathy moved out, actually). Mary wasn't bad for a little while, but got to be just too much for either Jill or I to take. So really, there were two and a half that didn't suck. I gave Mary half credit. Two and a half out of 10 isn't a great good to bad percentage. Ah, that was a fun trip down memory lane. Makes me remember why I live alone.

      Yet again, things got a little too comfortable for us. You see, my boyfriend and I have this little pattern we get stuck in. We get together, are happy for a large chunk of time, then one of us freaks out because it's just TOO comfortable and either does something stupid, and/or breaks up with the other, then we get back together and the other of us does something stupid and/or breaks it off again. I thought maybe we were all done with that after my last little dramatic issue, but I was wrong. He freaked out about something minor last night and told me it's over. Again. I would imagine we'll get back together, but we were supposed to do a joint trip to his family for Easter this weekend, and now I'm going to have to go deal with my family instead.  My family is only nice to me when there are non-family members around, so I expect a lot of verbal abuse this weekend. I suspect I'll return on Sunday night in a marginally bad mood, so I guess just be prepared for some excessive bitching (hey, at least I'm warning you this time). My sister-in-law isn't even going to be there (neither is my brother, but that's a good thing), so it'll be me bearing the brunt of it all.  So anyway, about the breakup. You see, my ex-not-really-boyfriend (the one before current, but after the ex that wanted me back) has kept in contact with me since we decided seeing each other wasn't the greatest idea (we were better as friends, and that was cool with both of us. and still is). Unfortunately, my boyfriend wasn't aware of this (I didn't know that he didn't know), and took a message from this guy last night. My boyfriend has a mad jealous streak in him, and he took this as this OTHER guy now trying to get back together with me after the previous ex had tried the same thing. He also has a knack for not letting me explain things and just jumps right to "we gotta break up". He'll calm down eventually and let me explain the whole deal to him. He always does. It's usually just a matter of when. He'll send flowers and an apology. It's his standard "sorry, I'm an idiot, please forgive me" process.  You'd be amazed how unaffected I was by his flipping out this time. Just sat there and let him yell at me and then walk out without saying much of anything except "that's not how it is at all". I didn't even bother fighting too much with him, because we've done this so many times that it's just easier to save the energy because we both know it won't do much good. We're both too headstrong to reason with when we're irrationally upset about something. That's why he didn't argue with me when I told him what was going on last time. Just said "whatever" and left. He'll be back. I'm not really even too worried (maybe I should be? I don't know).  We've only had one break up that lasted for longer than two weeks, and that was a massive, massive ordeal. There was so much behind that mess of crap that neither of us even knew what to say to each other after it had all happened, and I had moved away, so there was no need to even see each other or talk at all. That was a good seven months before we finally said enough was enough and worked it all out, and shortly thereafter, I moved back here and all was peachy until January of this year (a whole year since we'd gotten back together). We got past that mess of crap and I think that bodes well for this little minor thing. We'll be fine.

      So I got some bad news today. A young and amazing distance runner passed away this afternoon. David Kimani, a runner for the University of Alabama, collapsed in an on-campus caffeteria and later passed away at a local hospital. The cause of death is, as of the time of this post, unknown.  This man was an outstanding distance runner. I witnessed him win more than one NCAA championship in recent years, and was in awe of how easy he made this sport seem. He glided to the finish and barely seemed winded after whipping a competitive field of 5000 meter runners. I don't know if he had American citizenship (or if he was looking to get it), but I do know that he was part of the future of distance running. He will be sorely missed and I wish the best to his family, friends, teammates, and coaches. My thoughts are with you all in this time of loss.

      Woo! Summer is here! Thank god! Okay, excessive use of exclamation points stops now. I appologize. So sorry. But here's my complaint. I was thinking this might be the only one for the day, but I was wrong, there are at least three.   First complaint: it's in upwards of 90 degrees today. My heat? Is still cranking out hot steamy air. My thermostat is set to the lowest setting (something like 40 degrees), and yet there is still heat coming into my apartment from the boiler in the basement. You'd think the landlords would like to save a little cash and turn that off (or at the very least, turn it down), but nope. It's still running.  Second complaint: The professor I'm working for, Crazy (as she will be referred to from now on), called me while I was working at the country club. Not a problem, really, but what she wanted, was a big problem. Okay when I left her Saturday evening, she said she wanted me to work today. Fine, okay, whatever. So we set up a time to work at 1:00. Well, she called me late last night (11ish? I don't know for sure because I didn't take the message) and said that she didn't need me today. So I made plans for an afternoon of me, myself and I. It involved the beach, the sun, music, and a book. 10:45am at the country club and my cell phone starts ringing and it's Crazy. Crazy wants me to work today afterall and she wants me to work at 11:30. She's made an appointment with someone at a doctors office somewhere and needs me to give her a ride home. Well, first of all, no. I was at work until noon, and I wasn't going to leave to give her a lift. Second of all, no. She told me she didn't need me and I made plans for myself. 45 minutes isn't notice, it's a demand and I am nobody's servant. I don't care if she never wants me to work for her again. I will not be ordered around like a paid driver/maid/butler whenever she wants me to do something. I just won't do it. She was a little ticked when I said no and offered no reason why I couldn't do it after noon instead. Too bad!  Did I mention what she had me doing on Saturday? She had me picking up and sorting her dirty clothes off of her bedroom floor. She had me taking the clothes to the dry cleaner. She had me vaccuming. She had me washing dishes. She had me taking out the trash. She had me taking her to the mall and coming back to get her. The job I applied for was typist. Not personal assistant. I don't like doing most of those jobs at my house, let alone for anyone else. The day before I cleaned her damned refrigerator! And to be honest about it, it was disgusting! There was rotton meat in there. I could not get that smell out of my nose the rest of the day. It was just...disgusting.  Third complaint: Remember in complaint number two when I said I was going to the beach this afternoon? Well, said beach wasn't open. And by open I mean that there was no one there to unlock the gates around it. Yeah, that's right, gates. And you also have to pay a dollar to get in. Sand is rare and precious here in Iowa, and they make you pay to use it. So because the folks at the state park haven't employed anyone to man the gates at the beach, no one gets to use it. How dumb is that? Pretty goddamned dumb.  So, with the whole afternoon to do whatever, what did I do instead, you ask? Well, I came back to my sweltering apartment and decided it was cooler outside (and windier). So I decided the remainder of the afternoon would be spent outside, reguardless of the fact that I had no beach to lay on. I washed my car. I washed my neighbor lady's car (she's a little on the crippled side, and she seems like a sweet lady (she worries about me all the time), so I figured I'd do it while I had the soap and bucket out). I washed my boyfriend's car. I washed my boyfriend's roommate's car. I drew the line there. This was a free service for these people, and others were growing interested, so I stopped there. And it gave me a chance to test-drive the new swimwear I purchased in January (yeah, it's really cheap in January). It's cute, and it's comfortable, and more importantly, it stays in place. Yay, for good swimwear!   So, once all the cars were clean, I took my sorry ass to track practice so coach could run me ragged, since I haven't been doing that on my own these past few weeks (stupid cold and the cough that won't go the hell away). Buck ran the cough nearly out of me. I feel a LOT better. And now I'm back in my swealtering apartment. Holy fucking hell it's like a sauna in here. Breezy, yes, but hotter than hell. I'm a little disappointed with my food selection at the moment as all I have is warm food (or food that tastes best warm). Guess I'll be having ice water for dinner (or supper if you're from Iowa, and damn if I can't break that habbit. it will forever be supper to me) unless mr. lovely brings something home with him. That's doubtful.

      I had something else all ready to post here. It was full of rants, raves, bitching, praising, and all around random things that I'd compiled over the past few days. But tonight, something happened and I feel it needs to be posted by itself. I will post the rest of the things I was going to post in the next few days, until then, I leave you with my experience from tonight...  I just witnessed the most disgusting thing anyone could ever do to another human being. I saw a man in the target parking lot beating the hell out of his (?) child. This wasn't just spanking or slapping, it was much more violent, and the child was screaming like I've never heard a child scream before. Apparently, I was the only one that was noticing this (this irks me greatly, as there were no fewer than 5 other people walking through the parking lot at that time). And me, going into instant rage like I tend to do, marched right over to this man and demanded he stop immediately. At least I did in my head. My senses took over and said "hey, he could easily beat the hell out of you next, so just go into the store and call the police". So, that's exactly what I did. I walked up to the first employee I saw and said I need to see a manager immediately. As I was waiting, I called the police and gave them the 411. This adorable little old woman scurried to the front of the store and I told her what was going on, as well. She was mortified, and called security to the front of the store (and the 4 people in the store at the time assumed I was some shop lifter, but I don't care because I'd rather be thought of as a shoplifter than someone who didn't report a child abuser).   Unfortunately, it was dark, he was three rows away from where I was standing and I didn't get this guy's license plate number, but the folks at target brought out the surveilance videos of the parking lot and since the incident had happened within a few minutes of my entry to the store, they knew fairly accurately where to look. So five minutes of tape later, the vehicle was identified. The police are apparently en route to this man's home as I type this. If they need me to testify, I'm there. I hope to hell this man is not allowed to be in the presence of children for the remainder of his life (and if I had my way, it wouldn't be longer than a week). I hope this man burns in hell!  I'm so enraged right now, I don't even know what to do with myself. I can't fathom in what world this man is living in which this behavior is okay. Where is that switch in his brain telling him that you do not, under any circumstances, beat a child. The child's screams should at least tell you that. Those were so piercing that I could hear them inside my car.  And to those who didn't even bother to turn and look in that direction? What is wrong with you people? Don't tell me you didn't hear it, and don't tell me it didn't concern you. This child was no older than three years old (if he was that old at all), and could in no way defend himself. For you people to just turn and continue on with your business is just disgusting! I hope the guilt of what you turned your back on today resonates in your gut until it gives you ulcers. The next time you hear a child cry, I hope it nearly rips out your heart (if any of you have them at all). Sometimes I wonder if people ever actually use their brain anymore. Or is it just padding to keep their head rounded?  So the next time you hear a child screaming and crying, the least you could do is turn and look to see what's going on. I don't know about you, but I'd rather be wrong in assuming it was something that needed attention than to be right and pretend I didn't hear anything.

      I got this poem in the mail today. Please read it. It expresses my thoughts much better than I have these past weeks, and since it's from someone who is actually on the front lines, maybe it'll make more sense.  "Wish You Were Here"   For all the free people that still protest.  You're welcome. We protect you  and you are protected by the best.  Your voice is strong and loud,  but who will fight for you?  No one standing in your crowd.   We are your fathers, brothers, and sons,  wearing the boots and carrying guns.  We are the ones that leave all we own,  to make sure your future is carved in stone.  We are the ones who fight and die,  We might not be able to save the world,  Well, at least we try.   We walked the paths to where we are at  and we want no choice other than that.  so when you rally your group to complain,  take a look in the back of your brain.  In order for that flag you love to fly  wars must be fought and young men must die.  We came here to fight for the ones we hold dear.  If that's not respected, we would rather stay here.   So please stop yelling, put down your signs,  and pray for those behind enemy lines.  When the conflict is over and all is well,  be thankful that we chose to go through hell.   -- Corporal Joshua Miles and all the boys from 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines, Kuwait (now, presumably, Iraq)  Right here is where you'd expect me to whine a bit about Kansas losing tonight, but it really doesn't seem appropriate, so I'll hold off a while.

      Whoa!  Three times in less than seven days?  Must be some sort of record, don't you think.  I guess I have more time since I haven't done anything this week, so not only has my brain been working like a maniac, coming up with new thoughts, but I have more time to actually post stuff, too.  And, for the record, I honestly don't even remember making other posts this week.  So if the grammar and spelling and other things seemed off, that's why.  I do recall posting the new hate message on the front page, but other than that?  It's all fuzzy.   Between crazy lady professor and I, we're never going to work together again.  I was sick (and could easily still be classified as such) this past week.  Now she's sick.  I'm thinking maybe we should take the hint and just stop the madness.  Or rather stop the cycle of sick.  But I do enjoy having a cash-on-delivery situation there.  Who doesn't love working for a day and walking home with the money in your pocket, and not have to wait two or four weeks for payroll to spit out a generic check with half of the earnings missing because good ole Uncle Sam needed his cut of it.  Uncle Sam isn't touching this money, and quite frankly, there's not enough of it for him to bother with, but for the folks with the IRS (hey, ya never know!), I'll report this income on next years tax forms.  No need to come knocking on my door.  I'm listening to my downloaded version of Jason Mraz's Waiting for My Rocket to Come, and I have to be honest here.  I love the songs.  But I do know from seeing him perform live that his live versions of all of these songs are about a million times better.  They're a little too controlled on studio recordings, and all up in free range for the live performances.  I'm sure the same can be said for most artists, but Mraz should maybe consider a live-performance release.  I'd buy it (and that's saying something, because I don't buy many CDs).    What's the deal with the new crop of singer/songwriters looking like people I've dated?  Mraz looks a hell of a lot like a guy I dated (against my better judgment) in college.  Complete with the big trucker hat tipped to one side or the other.  John Mayer looks like my boyfriend.  And to be honest, the ex from stories past looks like a cross between Justin Timberlake and Ryan Phillippe, but don't tell him that, or he'll flip out.  And not that I ever dated her (although it would sure make a lot of guy's get all hot and bothered), one of my good friends looks remarkably like Norah Jones.  And another of my guy friends from high school looks like Skippy from the sitcom Family Ties.  To the point where people would ask him for his autograph.  It was entertaining to know that people would think that Skippy would be hanging out in malls and other random places in Iowa.  Not that he couldn't be, but really, I don't think he is or would be.  My best friend tells people she looks like Nicole Kidman.  She doesn't, but we let her tell people that anyway.  She likes to tell people that, so we let her have her fun.  Actually, she's about 5'3 and not at all built like Nicole.  The only thing remotely close is the hair.  I think she really just does it to see how agreeable people are, because far too many of them have said that they agree, and then we point and laugh at them later.  And you all remember Jordan Knight, right?  From New Kids on the Block?  Yeah, you remember him, even if you won't admit it.  Well, one of my friends from college is the spitting image of him.  Heh, and for the better part of a year, the "Nicole" look-alike thought he wanted her, only to find out that he was gay.  Poor girl.  Hehe, we still laugh about that one.  He set off my gaydar immediately the first time I met him, but he wasn't telling people, so I couldn't break her little heart with that news that wasn't mine to tell.  She's since gone to Target and picked up a gaydar of her very own, for a very low price, so she hasn't made that same mistake again.  Well, I think it's time for me to find some food in this house to eat.  There must be something other than toast.  I've been existing on toast and tomato soup for the past week, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it.  I need some pasta, or some meat, or something.  Stupid cold.  Oh, and one more thing.  MTV News is doing a story on basketball.  It truly is March Madness (you know, even though it's now April).  Oh, and GO KANSAS!!!!!

      I put some more hate items on the front page.  Now I have a question. Why is it that every single time I tell someone that I've been seeing my boyfriend for over three years they ask when we're going to get married? If I knew that, I'd have a shinny and sparkly ring on my finger. Look at my hand, fool. There's no ring. And no, I'm not going to give you a play-by play of every second of my relationship, but thanks for trying. No, we're not ready to get married yet. Just because everyone around here thinks that everyone should be married and having babies by the time they're 22, does not make that right for everyone. And no, if and when I get married, you're not invited. If you have to ask me why we're not married yet, then you won't be getting an invitation when we finally decide to tie the knot. Clearly you don't know me well enough for me to have told you this information, so clearly you have no business at my wedding. You can send a gift. That's cool. But you're not coming to the ceremony.  Okay, let's delve into friends from way back in high school. Yes, there are still a few of them that I talk to from time to time, and one that I actually believe will be my best friend until one of us leaves this earth (not because we have anything in common, but because we don't care that we have nothing in common and can just talk without saying much of anything). Let's just say I trust her (and I trust maybe 4 people on this planet). Okay, so I get a message from this girl that I was friends with in high school. A little background on her. She's the biggest idiot ever. When I think of her, the phrase "dumb as a box of rocks" comes to mind. I haven't spoken to this girl in about 6 months, and even that was by mere coincidence (she happened to be in the same place I was at the same time). So, she sends me this instant message telling me she has HUGE news. Intrigued, I reply to find out what it is. She then proceeds to go into great detail about her finally having lost her virginity. And then proceeds to tell me that one of our friends from high school also lost her virginity and felt the need to give me details of that as well. Hi, this is common sense knocking at your door. People don't want to know this. Especially people who have not spoken to you in six months or more. And details are really not necessary. I know the drill, in fact, I think it was you who asked me all kinds of questions about it when we were in high school. And I CERTAINLY didn't need to know about the other girl's experience. Don't you think that if she wants people to know about it, she'll tell them herself? Oh, and one more thing. Why did you feel the need to tell me that you may be pregnant because you were too fucking stupid to use a condom or any other sort of birth control? And then ask me not to lecture you? Don't give me a reason to lecture you and I won't do it. And when you tell me that this guy (whom you claim is the love of your life, yet you talk about your ex incessantly and want to know everything about what he's doing now) has offered to drop out of college to take care of the baby and be a stay-at-home dad while you finish school, don't expect me to not point out the obvious problem with that scenario. Which one of you is going to work to PAY for the baby? They're not free, you know. And god help the world if you ever actually do reproduce. I'm sorry, but that kid will have to have an amazing dad if he or she ever hopes to do anything with their life, because the kid won't get any common sense from you. And when you beg me not to tell my best friend because you know she'll tell her mother and her mother will tell YOUR mother? Don't hold your breath on that one. Someone needs to have a talk with you, and who better than your mother to do it.  Same girl, another story. Okay, acting like a 15 year old in high school is cool. Acting like a 15 year old when you're 25 is just a little much. No, it's a lot much. Always having to be louder than everyone, bigger than everyone, more outgoing than everyone, and laughing loudest at everyone's jokes outgrew its welcome about 6 years ago. Actually, before that, but when you're in high school, you never really know how to tell your friends to shut the hell up and stop acting like you're on drugs. And my dear, I know that low-rise jeans are all the rage, and that I wear them all the time, but really (and I'm being honest here, not intentionally mean), you need to lose about 20 lbs before you put another pair on. And because the kids on TV are showing their thong, does not mean that we need to see yours. And being proud that you have no idea what's going on in the real world, is not looked upon as cool anymore. Yes, I know you're in college, and that you're busy (and for god's sake you should be about done by now, shouldn't you? You've been in college for six years now, and you tell me you have two more to go? You need help), but for fuck's sake, turn on the television to something other than the cartoon network every once in a while. Let's put this in perspective. She has never heard of SARS. She is anti-war and anti-Bush, but can't come up with concrete reasons why. She was not aware that the war had started already (clearly lives in a hole), and was shocked to know that two lovely people that I know are fighting in it right now. She tried to argue with me about how the going to war would be wrong and such, and she clearly has forgotten that her debate skills suck rocks. She started backpedaling as soon as she heard some facts (well, that and that the war had actually started a few weeks ago). And we all know how much I hate stupid people. And this girl? Is the epitome of stupid.  Okay, new subject. I spent the better part of my afternoon scurrying around the greater W'loo area because of some mix-up on the part of the transportation people at the university. You see, the boyfriend and his vaulters were supposed to have a van to take themselves (and more importantly, their poles) down to the meet in Columbia, MO tomorrow morning. Well, transport decided that they didn't need a van and instead hooked them up with a small sedan. Now, for those of you that don't know, the poles are between 14 and 16 1/2 feet long and usually travel in a case that is right around 17 to 18 feet long. These pose a huge traveling problem as most flights refuse to transport these poles anymore. Well, by having a van, you can tie them to the luggage racks on the top of the vans and drive along without problem. You can't do that with a sedan. Now, normally, he would just take his Jeep Cherokee and the problem would be solved, but seeing as they had this van all lined up, he took his Jeep to be serviced (it's been acting funny), and the second option is usually my Ford Escape, but I need it to haul crazy lady professor to and from random sites all day tomorrow and through the weekend. Next logical option? Call a rental car place. Believe it or not, but there is not one van or SUV to rent in the entire county this weekend. Not one. So what did we finally figure out to do, you ask? Well, while they all were doing their class and practice thing, I hauled the poles to the airport to see what we could work out. After much begging, pleading, and flirting (this is rarely effective), I persuaded the Northwest (or Northworst as it's widely known) ticket agent to allow these poles on the flight with the rest of the team. Yes, folks, the vaulters rarely get to fly with the rest of the team, because of these damned poles. In fact, they hate to be separated from their poles for very long. They're strange little buggers. So, the vaulters will have to leave in the morning and drive down in a crappy little university sedan (complete with the stupid outdated decals on the sides. we got a new university logo about three years ago, but you'd never know it looking at the vehicles) and will have to wait until the rest of the team arrives to be reunited with their precious poles.   Now we're just hoping that the stupid flight people that were working there 2 years ago are not still there. Why is that, you ask? Well, these people decided that the cargo was too large and it'd fit better if it was cut in half. They apparently whipped out a hack saw and just sawed the poles in half. There were 6 poles in that particular travel bag. Each pole runs roughly $500 or more. These were all poles belonging to my boyfriend, and he'd paid for them all on his own. Needless to say, he had words with them. Their response? Well, we can glue or tape them back together for you. Um, no. No you can't. You can pay for the poles you ruined and then, while you're at it, why don't you fork over another month so he can break them in. You see, poles have to be broken in a bit, otherwise they're too stiff to jump well on them. So, yeah, I had words with this ticket man and made him sign a written statement saying that if anything happened to these poles (such as being cut in half, etc), that he personally would take responsibility for it and we would be ensured a set of replacement poles.

      Alright, my update is late. I said I'd update on Tuesday, but it's Thursday and I suck. But part of the reason is that I didn't get back until late Tuesday and had to work all day yesterday, so there's my excuse. To the three people reading, please forgive me. And I'm sorry. Mostly sorry that you find my life interesting enough to read about it, yet I often don't find it interesting enough to want to be me anymore. Or maybe I just get sick of my life and want someone else's. Hmm. Too much to think about there.  Which brings me to something else. I decided that I'm going to give up thinking. Well, I decided that Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning I was thinking in full force again, so that's not working out so well. Why would I give up thinking, you ask? Well, because people who don't think about anything (ever), often seem to be enjoying the hell out of everything. I just wonder what it's like to be them.  But, anyway, my weekend. Best weekend ever. Well, maybe an exageration, but a very good weekend nonetheless. After the past six months, a weekend like this was necessary, and much-deserved. I didn't get to leave until Saturday morning because I was at Crazy's until an ungodly hour on Friday night, and driving three hours after that was just not in the cards. Plus my parents would have locked the house, so I'd have had to sleep on the ground or in my car. So, I got home just before noon and did a load of laundry. By that time, our weekend plans were confirmed and we would not be scheduled to return to our respective homes (well, our parents' homes) until Monday. We decided since this was the first Memorial Day weekend in history that wasn't rainy and 50 degrees, we'd spend the entire time on a few different lakes doing lake-like-things.  So, Saturday I picked up Ryan from his dad's house and we made the 45 minute trek to pick up my best friend, Jamie, and about 278 other people on the way to Jamie's friend's parents' lakeside cabin on a little lake in north central Iowa (yeah, go ahead and be shocked that Iowa does actually have lakes). This 45 minute trip to Jamie's gave Ryan and I plenty of time to talk and for me to tell him that I was single again. We decided to do the friend thing. At least for now.  Okay, this cabin? More like a big-ass mansion style house on the lake. I'd seen this house while at this lake in the past, but it's even more spectacular than I'd imagined. There were like 37 bedrooms (I stopped counting after 10) or something, and it was just huge. HUGE! But it sounds like these people rent out rooms in a bed and breakfast style business, so it's not usually one family in this house. I guess they weren't open for the season, yet, so they'd given their daughter permission to let us have the entire place to ourselves, which was, to say the least, very fun. There was a huge chunk of beach (yeah, beach in Iowa), boats, waverunners, fully stocked fridge, fully stocked bar, and anything else we could ever think of needing. They also had a huge video projection machine (well the machine was small, but the viewing area was huge) that we hooked up outside and watched DVDs against the side of the house. It wasn't terribly warm on Saturday, so this was nice to just curl up under blankets outside and watch movies. After the movies, we all got nice and inebriated and many woke up with horrible hangovers.  So Sunday morning we decided to go up into Minnesota to Ryan's cabin. We shaved off a few of the people in our group (well, a crap-load of them, actually), so it was just Ryan, Jamie, four of her friends from college, and me. It was a beautiful day (warm, sunny, no wind), and we spent most of the day enjoying the weather. The boys, of course, thought we needed to go fishing. Ick. I don't mind fishing, but I'm not patient at all, and fishing is just not something I enjoy all that much. But, on a boat in the middle of a lake with no shade anywhere, is an excellent place to work on your tan, so I went anyway. And I don't want to hear anyone tell me that tanning is bad for me. I know it and I just don't care. We all gotta go sometime, so save your lectures. I like to be brown. I feel better when I'm brown. And reguardless of the amount of sunscreen I use, I still turn brown.  But, anyway, I got bored after about 2 hours sitting out there doing nothing, so I "fell" in the water and pretended I was drowning. Jamie's friends didn't know me well enough to know I was a lifeguard at one point, so they dove in after me. Jamie and Ryan stood in the boat laughing at them, and you know, you can't have that, so I pulled them in, too. Granted, they were both pretty much fully clothed (who goes to a lake without a bathing suit? Come on now, Jamie, you know you're going in the lake), but they were in the lake anyway. So, we went back to the cabin and these guys think the girls need to clean the fish. Okay, Ryan didn't say it, but that's because he knew better. The other three said it. They learned quickly that I don't clean anything with gills, feathers, or fur. I'll cook it or eat it, but no way am I cleaning it.  So we cooked up the fish (cleaned by the guys) for dinner, and damn was it good. Nothing like freshly caught fish fried up to make a great meal. All the good food and fresh air and sun apparently made most people pretty tired, pretty early. I had planned to sleep on one couch and Ryan was going to sleep on the other and give the two bedrooms to the other people. One bedroom has a queen sized bed - enough for two people and the other has two twin beds and another couch. Well, by the time people had fallen asleep in their respective places (Jamie and the other girl on the couches, the other three guys in the twin beds and that couch) the only thing left was the queen sized bed and the only other person awake was Ryan. Yeah, so add a great deal of alcohol to the mix and you can probably fill in the blanks what happened in that room.  At some point during the night, Ryan and I decided to extend the weekend another day because neither of us had to work Tuesday, so in the morning we took everyone else home and then went camping at this little old campground we used to go to all the time in high school. It's run by this adorable little old couple and everything is included. They give you the tents (or maybe they just give us the tents, I'm not sure), and let us use their boat, their firewood, their cooking utensils, and anything else we could possibly need. But what was funny about this is that we hadn't been to that place in probably 6 or 7 years and they still remembered us. It's a fairly busy little place and it's been a long time, but yet they still remembered us being up there several weekends of the summer. That day and night was a lot of fun, too. We just hung out and did camping-like things.  It was just an all out fun weekend, and one of the best I can remember. So where are Ryan and I? Well, we don't know, and neither of us particularly care, either. We're just having fun without strings attached (at least for the time being). Nothing set in stone, and nothing like a scary commitment. Just fun. Which is really all I need right now - something I don't have to think about or analyze to death, and something that I don't have to worry about turning out badly. So, yay for non-bad things in my life! YAY!

      Yeah, I'm clearly sucking at this journal thing for May. In April I was writing what felt like twice a day, and this month, I'm just not thinking of anything to ramble about. So, I guess I'll just do a condensed review of what's going on in my little life right now.  Work is boring all around. Crazy is still driving me nuts, although she finally got a new computer, so eventually I'll probably get to use it. We transferred files over yesterday, but not her book, so who the hell knows when she'll let me do that. Staring at Word 97 is annoying for anyone used to using the newest version, which would include me and nearly every other human being on the planet. Her husband/boyfriend/live-in troll chose yesterday to be an ass. I wasn't having it. Go ahead and yell at her, but don't do it when you've got other people in the house. And don't go yelling at her because she left a goddamned light on. It earned him a serious glare from me with a look of "one more word and I'm gonna kick your ass from here to next Thursday!" He stopped yelling after that. Just for future reference, don't go pissing me off on a Friday. I've got a whole week's worth of crap built up, and my tolerance for bullshit drops to nothing.   Yeah, that's about all that is going on in my life (now you understand why I didn't have anything to write about). And now I'm off for another weekend at home. This time it won't be so bad, because I'll see the family for about an hour, and then I'm spending the rest of the weekend with friends. One of those friends being the ex (Ryan), who doesn't yet know that I have added an ex to the list. It should be interesting. Or it could be nuts. Either way, I'm sure I'll have something to say about it when I get back on Tuesday.

      Looks as though I've been neglecting this website, doesn't it? That's because that is exactly what has been happening. After the broken windows in the car, you wouldn't anything else could happen. You'd be wrong. Crazy has been bugging me to no end. Last weekend I went home to pick up the car (with brand shiny new windows). Well, add on to the fact that it was the third weekend out of the past four that I was spending with my family, I got the worst cold/flu I've had in years. I didn't leave bed on Sunday and didn't move from the couch on Monday. Both mostly because I honestly didn't know where I was most of the time I was there. My family doesn't suck so much when you're dilerious. And when they all have to work, and aren't around to bother me. I finally drugged myself up adequately enough to drive back here Tuesday and promptly crashed on the couch for the night. Granted it was 4 in the afternoon, but to me, it was bedtime. Unfortunately, the heat in this apartment wasn't fixed yet, so it was swealtering in here. I can't sleep when it's that hot and I'm running a fever and undermedicated. I was awake every hour on the hour.  So, Thursday I finally was well enough (and rested enough) to get my ass back to work. Just in time to deal with Crazy. Crazy twisted her ankle while I've been down and out. Crazy made me want to push her out a window within 2 minutes of seeing her yesterday. If she whines about her crashed hard drive one more time, I swear to god I'm going to put my fist through her head. And no, most people do not still run Windows 95. Most people were smart enough to upgrade about 3 years ago. Most people don't still consider Windows 95 a great operating system. Even AOL doesn't make software for Windows 95 anymore. That should be a huge hint. AOL is crap. She's been yapping for months that she's getting a brand new computer with brand new software and brand new whatever. Still haven't seen it. Yesterday I got to figure out how to pay her cell phone bill online, only to find out that they turned her service off two months ago. Idiot. You have to pay your cell phone bill if you expect to continue using your cell phone. Damnit I hate it when my brain works and other people's don't.  Speaking of using my brain where other's don't. It seems that some people think it's a good idea to let everyone else know what a moron they are. Before it seemed that myself and a few others were the only people privy to that information, but lately these people are making it very difficult for the rest of the world to not notice how very stupid they really are. The term elitist is being tossed around, and for once, it's not directed at me. Yes, I can be elitist when I feel the need to be. No, I don't enjoy conversing with insane people. Yes, I will demand that those people not invade my private personal space. Yes, some people had a problem with that. Too goddamned bad.  It just amuses me that these same people are expressing the same sort of sentiment about the crazy person in a public forum (six months too late), whereas I expressed it in my own private personal space (and wasn't alone in my sentiment). And somehow, it's okay when they do it. It made me take the crazy person's side in the whole arguement. Because I'd take blatantly crazy over people who are retardedly oblivious to their own stupidity, with elitist attitudes, and who display downright moronic thought patterns.  And what amuses me even more, is that apparently aside from myself and the few others that I knew about, there is a whole mess of people who are on to these morons. They're aware just how elitist and full of shit these people really are. I'm thrilled to know that other people use that brain they were given.  Now, rumor has it that there is a Real World-er on Days of Our Lives. On purpose. I have to go see this to believe it.

      Ah, well, I'm back from my weekend with the family. Did I say this before? I don't remember, but I was home for my cousin's confirmation. This girl is SO me 9 years ago. She looks and acts so much like me, it's easy to understand why people assume we're sisters. Thing with her, though, she's adopted. She's looked just like me since birth. Really quite scary how much she looks like me. She has the same attitude and mannerisms as I do, as well. Also, she's into the same things I am into and plays all the same sports I played in high school. I've never seen her play, but my old coaches from my high school have all commented to me that it shouldn't be allowable for me to be back in high school for a rival school. These things all make our family crazy. Because they didn't much like me, so having pv version 2.0 in their midst is a little unsettling to them. And if she really does turn out just like me, I feel bad for her. She's got a lot of shit coming her way in the next few years.  She was sad to not see the ex with me. She had a little man-crush on him (as I've found do most 15 year old girls), and it was positively adorable. She'd turn 16 shades of red when she saw him, and then just hang on his every word for the rest of the time. He knew this, so he was always pretty cool with her. Most guys I know would take advantage of that, but not him. He never did, he just paid attention to her and let her have her little crush. It really was cute. I'm not sure, but I think she was a little more upset that we broke up than I was. Poor girl.  But, back to Sunday and the festivities. It seems that during the confirmation party thing (cake and presents constitutes a party, doesn't it?), some kids in town thought it'd be fun to try to break into my car. Well, I have that shatter-proof glass, so they never did actually get IN the car, but they did sucessfully break every single window. Lovely. So I'm driving the old car that my sister-in-law used to drive in high school (which used to be her parents' car prior to being in her possession, and then she got a new car and sold it to my dad). Needless to say, it's old and crappy. I'm not happy about that, but mostly I'm not happy that I have to go home on Mother's Day weekend to get my car back.  First of all, that's three weekends out of four that I'll have spent at that place. I can't deal with that. Second of all, it's Mother's Day, and I believe I've already covered this in a post from last week. Third of all, I can only deal with so much abuse from them. I took my fair share of heat this weekend and most of it involved my breakup and how it was my fault and that I'm a worthless piece of crap. And people wonder why I hate my family.  But, anyway, I'm home now and back to my miserable little life. If that sounds as pathetic as I feel right now, then we're all on the same page. I even debated calling the other ex (you remember, the one that wanted me back a few months back), but I don't want him to get the wrong idea. It'd be just too much to deal with right now, and I have enough to deal with, already.  Did I mention that I'm cranky. I've reached that part of the breakup phase. I could easily punch anyone in the head right now, whether they're someone I have a reason to hit or not. Ah, cranky. Tomorrow I'll probably be even more cranky, as I just got off the phone with Crazy and she wants me to haul her sorry ass around starting in the morning. I'm sure I'll be extra cranky tomorrow night, so stay tuned for further bitching.

      Remember how I said things didn't feel right yesterday?  Must have been a premonition as to what was to come for later in the day.  Turns out that the boyfriend is now officially and permanently the ex-boyfriend.  He stopped by last night to pick up everything of his that was here, and I sent with him things that he'd given to me that I didn't want around without him here.  We talked, argued, screamed at each other for a good two and a half hours last night, and it was after that when we both realized that this was not good for either of us anymore.  Am I sad about it?  Of course I am.  Very much so.  And I'm sure I'll hit every other emotion out there before I'm ready to move on with my life.    So, I'm single.  What does that mean?  I sat down and figured it out a while back how often I've been single since I was 14 (right around 10 years ago).  Eleven months.  I don't think I even know how to be single.  Which is sad.  I'm pretty independent, so maybe it'll be fine.  The last time I was single, it wasn't fine, but that was a completely different time.  I didn't have any friends around me then, but I do now.  I'll be fine.  I'll just keep telling myself that I'll be fine, and eventually, I will be.  The past three years have included the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.  At times it seemed that the highs outweighed the lows, but looking back now, the lows were some of the lowest points in my life.  And for those of you that know all the details of my life, that's really sad.  No, I don't blame him for all of the things that have happened over the past three years, but maybe I need this break to clear the slate.  To just start over.  At the very least, to put all of the bad things that happened in that three year span behind me.  Sadly, that will mean putting all the good things that happened in that span behind me as well, but I think it'll be worth it.  At this point, you're probably thinking that I sound pretty okay with all of this, and that I'm dealing with it in a very healthy manner.  I'll warn you, it hasn't all sunk in yet, so I can pretty much guarantee you'll find me sobbing, whining, bitching, throwing things, and giving a good rendition of any other negative behavior you can think of in the next month or two (maybe four or five).  Will I ever be completely over him?  That's highly doubtful.  I never got completely over Ryan, either.  He'll hold a little piece of my heart forever.

      Hey! I've been away for a while (again). I'm doing a little reworking in the archives right now (nothing you all will notice once it's done, but it'll make my job easier), so things may be up or they may be down on and off today. It'll all be square by morning, though, so check back then if you can't find what you were looking for. Also, I had started recapping the Real World things - mostly because one of my friends asked me to since she no longer has cable and hates missing this show, no matter how much it sucks. Well, those will be in a separate section now. They'll be living in the archives area for now, but with separate pages for each recap. Blah blah blah maintenance, so just be patient and it'll all be at least in working order tomorrow. I promise.

      I'm all kinds of amused today. Some of you will understand what I'm talking about here, and some of you will think "What the hell? She's off her meds again." So why am I amused? Well, I've been told by a reliable source that since there's a controversy brewing, and knowing easily what side I'll be on, there are people waiting for me to join the brawl. The people, however, are not those that I would defend - these people are on the other side of the argument, and they KNOW it.  These morons actually think I'm dumb enough to walk into that powder keg and wait for it to explode. No thanks. I'll stick to making logical points to people that seem to understand English (and logic and tact), and leave the flaming, bitchy responses to them. They're digging their own grave, while the rest of us sit back, watch, and say to each other that it's about time but that we all knew they'd eventually step in the giant pile of shit they created.  People already know how I feel on the subject. I don't need to say it again, and I won't. Once a point is made, it's usually best to let it sit as is - that is unless you've made an ass out of yourself, in which case it's usually best to acknowledge it and apologize.  Weekly hits on this page are above average - and I know that this whole situation is the reason why. But hey, I'm not one to argue with an increase in hits. So, for those of you here for the first time, come on back. I might say something you can actually use against me some time. Sorry to say that today is not your day if that's what you're looking for.

      So, hmm.  What’s gone on since Thursday?  Just a few things, some fun, some standard.  Let’s see.  I got a call late Thursday night from a friend of mine who is now an activity coordinator for festivals in Eastern Iowa.  He told me that they’d like a “big name” to compete in the My Waterloo Days Annual 5K Race/Walk so that there would be a draw for runners.  They had Ron Steele and Jamie Phillips and James Patrick (covering the local TV and a couple radio stations), but would like a former Panther to draw more college kids and to maybe add a bit of a competition to the thing.  You see, they had some prize money, and they wanted to make sure it went to someone who was up on the competitive end of things, so that they can maybe draw some bigger names next year.  So, of course, I was flattered because they considered me a “big name”, and agreed.  When was this race to be held?  Saturday morning at 8am!  Hello.  That left me no time to get race-ready at all.  There is a particular process you go through during a pre-race week to build up to the actual race, and I was completely unable to do it.  I did the all-carbohydrate diet on Friday, and eased up on the run (which was not at all planned, because Friday is usually my hard day) for that day.   Saturday morning rolls around and I find out quickly that the temperature has changed drastically from the weather through the rest of the week.  All week it had been well into the 60s in the early mornings, and around 70 by 8am.  Saturday it never got above 63, and was a whopping 42 degrees at race time.  Not nice.  Not nice at all.  A few of my former athletes were in the men’s side of the competition, so at least I had someone to run with (and to block the wind for me – eventually, they’ll learn to not allow this, but they’re young).  Well, long story short (too late), I won the women’s competition – and more importantly, the $200 prize.  My time was terrible, but about as good as can be expected with the short notice and terrible running weather (which might not have been so bad had I actually planned for cold weather, but my windy shorts provided very little protection from the cold).  I was a little less than 2 minutes off my personal best time, and I suspect that will improve greatly throughout the summer.  I guess I hadn’t planned on doing 5K races – or really any races at all – but now that I have an official race under my belt, I’m going to give it a few more tries.  I guess I should take advantage of my ability and talent while I still have it, because I know – better than most people – that it may not last forever.  For those of you wondering my time, it was 18:21 – hand timed.  Ryan unexpectedly showed up while I was at the race.  Luckily, he ran into someone in the hallway of my building who I had told about the 5k.  She pointed him in the right direction and he was hanging out at my car when I got there.  What a nice surprise!  I did the standard verification that he wasn’t making this thing we’ve got going on something serious, and he assured me he wasn’t.  Of course, when I got home, there was a message from Crazy.  I’d told her I was going to be around all weekend and that I could work for her.  My mistake, so I couldn’t just blow her off.  Even with my prize dough I still need the paychecks from her to keep me afloat around this joint.  So, I ended up dealing with her for 4 hours on Saturday, too.    I was dead tired when I finally got home, but there was Ryan to rub my feet and shoulders – and then sit on my feet because they were fucking cold!  They finally (FINALLY) figured out the heat issue in this place and have shut it off for the summer.  Well, I could have handled the heat for a couple more days, as the weather has gone to shit, and quickly.  But the weekend with Ryan was good.  Just relaxing to have him around – which cannot be said for most anyone else.  He just doesn’t get on my nerves like most other people do.  Go ahead and be amazed that there is someone out there that I don’t (at least once) have the urge to slaughter with a hammer.  I am worried, though, that he’s starting to think this is more than either of us planned it to be.  If he spontaneously shows up again this coming weekend, I’m going to have to have a talk with him.  Two weekends in a row is one thing, but three (and then four counting the weekend after that we planned on getting together) is bordering on more-than-friends relationship.  And if you know this guy at all, you know that he doesn’t do spontaneous.  He’s a meticulous planner – the most organized, structured person I know.  And two weekends in a row of spontaneous activity is just fishy.  I’m probably preparing that little talk for nothing, though.  He probably won’t show up, but I’d like to be prepared if he does.

      Alright, the birthday is over, and surprisingly, I had a pretty good day. Ryan came down yesterday morning and we spent the whole day doing outdoor things, because the weather was spectacular. He came complete with all of my favorite foods (including 5 different flavors of Ben & Jerry's), and made the most wonderful dinner of baked ziti last night, and then made desert, which was an amazing strawberry shortcake creation. Now, last time Ryan and I were seeing each other, this guy couldn't cook a can of chicken noodle soup without help. And let me clarify for a second that we are not seeing each other right now. Will that ever change? Well, who knows. I'm not worrying about that right now.  So really, a very nice day. I have only one gripe. And it's miniscule and petty. You see, a web community that I belong to has these strange little birthday banners they put up for everyone. Now, I know that I'm not one of the administrators' favorite people, but it's upsetting that they not only didn't put the banner up for me, but that they put one up for a person they never even pretended to like just last week. I know that their excuse will be that neither of them were there, or that I didn't put my name on the birthday list, and both of those would be outright lies. The really sad part about this is that they're in the middle of a firestorm for being less than nice and less than honest about things that go on at that board. Well, these are the kinds of things that make the rest of the posters uncomfortable with the administrators. All people are asking for is a little consistency and fairness, and so far, they have not been able to provide any. Do I care at all about the banner? Not really, but it's the principle of the matter. Either do it for everyone, or don't do it at all. And yes, I would understand if they were both away and had forgotten to put it up before they left or have someone else do it. But that was not the case.  This goes along the lines of how they respond to individual posts on this message board. If it's someone they tend to like (and from what I've seen, the criteria for this honor is agreeing with anything they say or do), they let it be. If it's someone they don't like, the post is taken line by line and ripped up in usually the most illogical manner you've probably ever seen. Most of the time, the arguments they come up with for anything said against their groupthink mind patterns are bizarre and generally make no sense. If you are disliked by them, you officially lose the right to have an opinion on anything. It's near impossible to argue with nonsensical administrators, because once you piss them off, they're likely to ban you. In fact, I'm certain that the only reason I haven't been banned is because there is a small circle of people there that like me, and they worry that I wouldn't go quietly, and the people that like me wouldn't let them get by with it.  For the most part, I've given up on that community. I read no more than two threads (and only skim one of them for someone either asking me something or saying something of interest to me), unless I'm pointed somewhere to look at something. Because it's just a message board, I can't make myself care enough to try to be nice when what I really feel like doing is making a lengthy entry on just how much bullshit I've seen, and there really is a lot.  One last thing and I'll stop bitching about the message board (why am I bitching at all? It's a message board for christ's sake, and it shouldn't cause this much drama, but for some reason, it keeps on causing shit). The current firestorm is because an outsider to the board threw out the bait that would make a lot of things clearer to those that were refusing to see what was going on behind the scenes. These administrators, and some of their circle (including the current moderators -- not to be confused with the moderators at the time of the incident, because the list has changed) were dumb enough to take the bait. Now the person that baited them is being blamed for the way they reacted, when the people that took the bait are really to blame for all the drama. The problem actually lies in the fact that none of these people see what they're doing. Here's an excerpt of something I said as the drama was unfolding, and it's easier than just typing it out again:  Next time these people feel like being all high and mighty and elitist and deny that they are any of those things, perhaps they should step carefully, because the next could be a trap that leaves them dangling by their ankles from a tree in the middle of nowhere. It's like they keep trying to walk through the glass door before they open it. Just keep right on smacking into it and never learn to open the damn door. If you're going to be a bitch, be a bitch. But don't pretend you're not, when you and everyone around you know that is exactly what you are. And don't get all insulted when someone calls you on it. If you can't handle the shit that goes along with being a bitch, perhaps you should just walk away and try something different, because this personality isn't working anymore.  Now, for the people that keep checking in to see what I thought on the matter being discussed to death in one of those threads, well, you finally got what you were looking for. I know you were looking for ammunition to use against me, and I may have just given it to you. And since I know the people that are looking for ammunition all too well, make sure you IM all your little groupies to tell them what a bitch I am. At least I can handle the title.  Alright, we now return to your regularly scheduled program.

      Alright, I confess, it's actually July 19, but I haven't slept so it doesn't count as a day switch yet. What does that mean? Well, it's my birthday. And like the last 18, this one will go on without any fanfare. Just the way I prefer it. My parents were yapping about coming down here for the weekend, but I'm in the process of putting the kibosh on that little potential disaster. So, uh, Jamie, if you're reading this, if anyone asks, you and a half dozen of your friends showed up unexpectedly Friday night.  I hate my birthday. I really, really do. It's a bad day from start to finish, no matter what happens. It's my day of the year to hibernate and not be bothered. Some people have hibernated with me on a few birthdays, but the list is short, and I like it that way. There are only two or three people I can even think of that I would ever want around me on my birthday, and, to say the least, my parents don't make that list.  Tomorrow is the first day in what seems like months (which is actually only eight days) that I don't have to wake up and go to any sort of work related thing. I can sit in my house, in my PJs, with a couple pints of Ben & Jerry's and the remote. Of course, I have to go to the store to get the ice cream, but the rest is all ready to go. My god, I can't wait.

      Okay, so those Real World recaps I was doing? I lost interest. Because I have the attention span of a gnat sometimes. That and there's been other shit going on in my life that had nothing to do with watching an MTV reality program. Of course, now that Big Brother has started, I'm firmly back on the reality bandwagon, but BB is an addiction I have yet to find a cure for.  So anyway, an update on the goings on in my life since June. July 4th came and went and involved an extended stay for me in a hospital. Let's not rehash how very much I hate hospitals. See the hate area on the front page for that. What was wrong, you ask? Well, no one knows. I spiked a high fever and passed out while visiting friends and woke up in a hospital bed having blood drawn. It's a mystery, but the headache I've had since is only slightly annoying. You know, in that not so slightly way. The light-headedness is a trip, too.  Crazy took a zero sympathy stance on that and continued to make me do mundane, labor-intensive tasks. She nearly threw a hissy fit when I refused to lug a huge box up the stairs because at that moment the stairs were rotating around me. She finally turned her article in. One that was supposed to be finished July 5, but she was able to get an extension until yesterday. And she finished it six minutes before the last FedEx truck left, so that rushing was fun. Except not.  She's leaving in August, and after the shit she pulled the first week of July, August can't come fast enough. It involved the airport, a ticket agent, the lack of birth certificate or passport, and a whole lot of bitching. And it resulted in two trips to the airport, and putty permanently affixed to the backseat of my car. Crazy about lost her life that week.  I must go now. And clean my apartment. Because someone mentioned something about coming here this weekend and the place is a disaster. I hate having guests that aren't my good friends. They interfere with my routine. I get the feeling this weekend is going to be a "hey, happy birthday, we're going to sleep at your house because we're too cheap to stay at the Super 8 down the road." I have a life to live here, people. And it doesn't involve uninvited houseguests.

      Here's a little something one of my good friend's mother sent me and it's so true that it's rediculous.  I don't agree with everything in it (see the religious undertones), but for the most part, it's dead on.    We Will Miss Him and SO WE SHOULD!!!!    Today we mourn the passing of an old friend, in the USA, by the name of Common Sense. Common Sense lived a long life but died recently in the United States. No one really knows how old he was, since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape.   He selflessly devoted his life to service in schools, hospitals, homes, factories and helping folks get jobs done without fanfare and foolishness. For decades, petty rules, silly laws, and frivolous lawsuits held no power over Common Sense. He was credited with cultivating such valued lessons as to know when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the worm, and that life isn't always fair.   Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn), reliable parenting strategies (the adults are in charge, not the kids), and it's okay to come in second. A veteran of the Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, and the Technological Revolution, Common Sense survived cultural and educational trends including  body piercing, whole language, and "new math."   His health declined when he became infected with the "If-it-only-helps-one-person-it's-worth-it" virus. In recent decades his waning strength proved no match for the ravages of well intentioned but overbearing regulations. He watched in pain as good people became ruled by self-seeking lawyers. His health rapidly deteriorated when schools endlessly implemented zero-tolerance policies.   Reports of a six-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate, a teen suspended for taking a swig of mouthwash after lunch, and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student only worsened  his condition.   It declined even further when schools had to get parental consent to administer aspirin to a student but could not inform the parent when a female student was pregnant or wanted an abortion.   Common Sense lost his will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband, churches became businesses, criminals received better treatment than victims, and federal judges stuck their noses in everything from the Boy Scouts to professional sports.   Finally, when people, too stupid to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot, were awarded a huge settlement, Common Sense threw in the towel. As the end neared, Common Sense drifted in and out of logic but was kept informed of developments regarding questionable regulations such as those for low flow toilets, rocking chairs, and stepladders.   Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust; his wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason. He is survived by two stepbrothers: My Rights, and Ima Whiner. Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.  12:57 am

      Yeah, ouch!  There are much stronger words for such pain, but I'm keeping it clean for the kids.  Okay, no, I'm not, but the string of four-letter words I'd like to say is too long for the title area.   This morning when I was just over six miles into my morning run my hamstring decided to fuck with me.  It felt like someone had taken an aluminum bat and smashed it into the back of my right leg.  The fun part about this story?  I had FOUR MILES to go to get back to my house.  And no phone.  It took me almost two hours to get back here, limping, hopping on my left leg at times, sitting several times and realizing that if I sat too long the muscle would never let me actually get back up.  You've probably seen those races on television (if you happen to ever watch track and field on television--many people don't, which is why it's never on, which is a subject in and of itself that pisses me off) with a closeup of a runner's face when all of a sudden they look like they've been shot.  Remember Michael Johnson and Maurice Green in the 200m at the 2000 Olympic Trials?  Both of them had that look that they'd just been shot.  That, my friends, is a hamstring injury.  You sort of feel it coming, but you keep running.  Hoping that it will work itself out.  Sometimes it does.  Sometimes it doesn't.  When it doesn't is when you get that "someone just shot me" look.   When I finally did get back here, there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  Nothing.  I have ice and heat alternating on it.  I'm taking advil.  I'm waiting until the week starts and the trainers are back in the office to go in and get that taken care of.  So, I just sit here, getting up every so often to try and stretch it out.  I need to go to the store today because the food situation in my kitchen is approaching dire.  I don't want to have to pull out the crutches for such a task.  I fear I may have to.  I hate those damn things.   Note to self: bring a phone when you go out on runs--the chances of someone coming upon you at 6 in the morning anywhere from five to seven miles out into the middle of nowhere is pretty slim.  Next time, you might not be lucky enough to be able to hop and limp back on one good leg.  Idiot.   So, yeah, ouch.  11:35 am

      People!  Really!  Just when I think people can't suck any more than they do, they go and surprise me.  Now that may be an unfair generalization, and I'm trying to rid myself of those, but at this point, when 3 people in your life don't suck and everyone else does, I think the generalization is fair.  I found something out tonight.  Fifth or Sixth hand.  From someone I detest.  If she didn't have proof, I wouldn't have believed it to be true, but there it was.  Concrete, incriminating, blood-boiling proof.  Proof that another person (and another group of people that are associated with this person) are just no longer worth my time.  The fact that the incident in question (at least the proof I have) is more than two months old is even more bothersome.   This person had the nerve to say to me very recently that we never talk anymore.  Well, at the time it was because I felt like I was out of the loop and didn't feel connected to her anymore because she never made it seem that anything I said was even the least bit important.  She also NEVER initiated a conversation.  It's not my job to start a conversation with everyone all the time.  It seemed like she had a new group of people to talk to and I was disposable.  That and I didn't tell her what she wanted to hear all the time.  I find this quality in people to be patronizing, and I refuse to be a part of it.   Well, now I have more reason to not talk to her anymore.  She had the nerve (or maybe it's cowardice, I don't know) to talk about me behind my back, and even used the term 'stupid' more than once.  Now, that's fine, go ahead and call me stupid.  I'll be the first to admit that I do dumb things.  It's part of being human.  But the reason she called me stupid?  Because of something I said on this here site that SHE and other people misinterpreted.  Now, these other people misinterpreted most likely because they choose to see me as this evil person who spends all of her time hating every little thing they do and trash talking them every hour of the day.  Except, you see, I have a life (and you've read about bits and pieces of it here).  Now, I have no idea how or why she missinterpreted this entry, but she did.  Fine.  No, that's fine.  It is.  But the fact that she didn't bother asking me about it is what pisses me off.  In no way did the entry say anything about her at all (and that wasn't the part that was messed up in translation), but she chose to take these other people's word that what I did was wrong.   Now, listen, I've said some not-so-tactful things, and I'm the first to admit that when I'm enraged enough, I post first, think later.  Look at most of the shit I've written in August alone.  This was not one of those instances.  This was a simple case of her not bothering to get clarification.   It's not my fault that the other people misinterpreted.  It's not my fault that she agreed with them.  It's also not my fault that she chose to let other people know her interpretation of my thoughts and they formed an image of me that isn't accurate or fair to me.    It does explain a few things, though.  The fact that I had reason to be paranoid when everyone assured me I didn't.  Looks like I'm not crazy after all.  Okay, I probably am, but this no longer gives solid evidence supporting it.   I just want people to remember this.  Remember that when you go talking shit about me behind my back, realize that somehow I always find out.  It always gets back around to me.  Always.  I'm not saying that you have to stop talking shit about me (and I'm certainly not going to stop talking shit about other people that piss me off), but just be more careful in who you're talking to.  Maybe you can't trust them.  I have a hard time trusting anyone right now.  Now, I would assume, there is someone else out there having some trust issues as well.  Welcome.  It's not as much fun as it looks.  9:55 pm

      Okay, I was away much longer than I expected to be.  Sorry about that.   I went up to Minneapolis for the weekend and found myself having the flu that Ryan handed off to me after I spent all day Saturday and most of Sunday taking care of him for the very same flu.  Bleh.  It wasn't fun.  At all.  And since I was taking care of Ryan (and also hungover Jamie), I didn't get to wear my new shirt out in public.  But they appreciated it.  They thought it was funny.  While not intended to be a joke, it turned out to be one, and that's okay with me.  If nothing else, at least I can make someone laugh, right?   Ryan also helped me out with something.  He yelled at me for a few hours and finally drilled into my head that when everyone and everything around me sucks, that doesn't give me the right to be a completely horrendous shell of a human being.  Because that's what I've been for the last week or so.  So to all of you that thought (but were too nice to say) I was being horrible (because I was), I apologize.   So, I get home today and have no fewer than 14 messages from Crazy.  Hey, lady, you left for Detroit on Monday.  Before noon.  I am not going over to your house to help your boyfriend pack any more.  He's a big boy.  If he can't do it himself, then that's just too damn bad.  It's not my problem anymore.  Not my problem at all.  I'm finished with you and your idiot self.  Charlie will have to figure out how to do shit on his own.  I don't work for Charlie.  I never did.  I'm done.  No, I won't run to the countertop shop and pick up  your piece of countertop.  He can do it.  He has a car.  No, I won't call you long distance in Detroit.  I don't have anything left to say to you.  Shove off, freak.  I'm done.  6:27 pm

      I made a little purchase today.  Well, I suppose that would technically be yesterday.  I bought myself a simple t-shirt.  It's a white/red ringer.  Then I had some words put on it.  I will be debuting this t-shirt Saturday up in Minneapolis.  Oh, what does it read, you ask?  Well in big bold red print across the front it says "Punching Bag."  Then in little print underneath, it says "Take your best shot."  I debated putting "The gloves are off...I'm fighting back," but I don't want to give my opponents any warning before I take a swing at them.  And no, that's not literal.  Unless it is.   I'm watching Inside Edition right now, and they have women on there that are openly saying that they're too pretty to date.  They think that they look so good that men just won't approach them.  Hey, ladies, I'd just like to point out to you that none of you actually are that pretty.  Yeah, none of you are dogs, but you all look pretty average.  Oh, and the reason men won't approach you?  It's because your attitude tells them to not waste their time.  Who wants to spend time with a woman that is so sure she looks so good that men just won't ask them out.  I'm all for self love, but that only is admirable up to a point.  These women blasted past that about 12 years ago and the point is no longer visible in the rearview mirrors.  Get over yourselves.   Oh, wait, the problem they're finding is that the nice guys won't ask them out, just the arrogant assholes.  Hey, I know why.  Nice guys know better than to deal with a woman who is so sure she's the shit that she makes the guy feel unworthy.  Shut up, ladies.  A lot.  I should also mention that these women were models from Los Angeles.  I think that pretty much sums up the problem right there.  1:33 am

      Two more days.  To more damn days with Crazy and it's done.  For good.  She's been rattling on about sending me stuff to do from Detroit, and I agreed to it, but I can easily blow those off.  I will get to go places during the day again (for a little while) and not have to have this frizzy-headed psychopath embarassing me at every turn.   I am going away for the weekend.  She's leaving Monday (baring any unforseen disaster).  That's two fewer days I have to deal with her.  Minneapolis, here I come.  Here's to me having a pleasant weekend.  Hopefully.  It's all kind of mysterious.  I am observant, so I am aware there is something in the works that I'm not privy to, but because the two people doing the plotting are the only two people in the world I trust right now, I'm not that worried (I admit I was at first).   Someone tell me why when I tell Crazy to be quiet so I can listen to Bigger Than My Body for the first time on the radio, she proceeds to perform her hack analysis on the song and the artist and tell me it sucks because it's not the same as the rest of the music on the radio right now.  Um, shut up.  The woman hates Matchbox 20.  She hates John Mayer.  She hates Jason Mraz.  She hates Michelle Branch.  She's not a fan of Vanessa Carlton.  But she loves Avril Levigne (or howeverthehell you spell it).  Her taste in music is shit.  I admit BTMB isn't John Mayer's greatest song ever, but it most certainly doesn't suck.  And because it isn't the same as everyotherdamnthing on the radio right now, that makes it better than average.  Get over yourself, you fucking whacko!  1:36 pm

      Well, now that I have this handy dandy blog, the least I could do is use it, right?  So here's what I'm gonna do for today's entry.  I'm going to give you a minute by minute rundown of my day today (and since I have a sickening habit of looking at my watch all the damn time, these times are fairly accurate).   5:29am - Wake up.  Rub eyes.  Groan.  Grab running shoes.   5:36am - Begin morning run.   6:27am - Return from morning run.   6:32am - Push ups.   6:37am - Assorted abdominal work.   7:02am - Turn on shower.  Wait for hot water.   7:08am - Finally get hot water.  Get in shower.   7:38am - Finally decide to get out of shower and deal with the rest of the day.   7:39am - Dig around in closet.  Decide to put pajamas back on.   7:42am - Comb out hair.  Decide it's a pony tail day (as if there are any other).   7:51am - Check voice mail.  Laugh at bill collector looking for Lindsey.  I don't know Lindsey, but I know she doesn't pay her bills.   8:01am - Dig for bread in freezer.   8:02am - Retrieve bread and commence toast making.   8:15am - Finish toast.  Mainline bottle of gatorade.   8:19am - Turn on radio.  Wait impatiently for new John Mayer song to come on the radio.   9:29am - Realize living in Iowa has some major downsides.  On the top of that list is the fact that music takes a million years to get here, and once it does, they play it until you hate it.  And if you hate it when it gets here, you want to kill someone by the time it's finally reached reduced airplay status.   9:30am - Receive email that puts me in a bad mood for the day (but not as bad of a mood as I've been in since last Thursday).   9:34am - Receive solid confirmation that most of my friends fit into the category marked 'Shit' right now.   9:58am - Start the pilgrimage throughout the Internet reading material that polutes most of my mornings these days (including, but not limited to good message boards, good running websites, bad message boards on bad running websites, news sites, sport sites, and then a rousing game of Mah Jong).   11:52pm - Realize that Crazy may be the smartest person I've dealt with in the last three days.  Bang head against wall.  Reaffirm that right now, most of my friends = shit.   12:15pm - Begin applying products to hair and face.  Remember no one important will see me today, so put the expensive products back in the cupboard.  Grab the walmart brand cleanser, walmart brand moisturizer, sample packs of hair gel, some powder and some Carmex (old tube from like 1985 -- the shit never goes bad, and it never runs out).  Proclaim that I look good enough to not see anyone today.  Good enough is good enough.  Put hair back up in pony tail -- the hard labor I have planned for the day is not condusive for a hair-down day.   12:28pm - Check voicemail.  Realize that Crazy decided she doesn't need me until 2pm instead of 1pm.  Also wonder why she wants me to bring a bathroom scale.  Decide to call her back, but not ask about the need for the scale.  Don't have one anyway.   12:29pm - Make egg sandwich.  Look for cheese slices.  Find none.  Wonder who ate them.  Wonder if I actually bought any.  Wonder where my brain is today.   12:35pm - Eat egg sandwich.  Proclaim it easy and good -- doesn't get much better than that.   12:59pm - Make another egg sandwich.  Try it with mayo and ketchup.   1:06pm - Eat egg sandwich with mayo and ketchup.  Decide cheese is better, but this is a viable substitute.   1:38pm - Decide to change into real clothes.  Sweat shorts and a tshirt.  Not to be confused with pajamas.  Sweat shorts and a tank top.   1:44pm - Get in car to go to Crazy's.   1:57pm - Find parking space near Crazy's and ring the doorbell/buzzer-thingy.   2:01pm - Crazy finally opens the door.  She still looks crazy.   2:04pm - Go in search of missing DVD.   2:39pm - Find missing DVD.   2:47pm - Get in car for trip to Grand China, Hollywood Video, Home Depot and WalMart.  Realize there will be no trip to Target today.  Get sad.   2:56pm - Arrive at Grand China.  Knock on door of closed restaurant.  Get stared at by nearby drivers.  Little asian man finally opens doors.  Drop asian vegetables off so Chef Woo can make special Vietnamese dinner for Crazy and boyfriend Charlie.  What?  That doesn't make sense?  No kidding.   3:21pm - Drop DVDs off at Hollywood video.  Peruse new releases while Crazy seeks out new unknown movies to watch and bitch about tomorrow.   3:57pm - Leave Hollywood Video.   4:08pm - Arrive at Home Depot.  Realize Crazy needs an interpreter to translate Crazy into English so she can explain she needs a new drain hose for her dishwasher (the one she's never used), a new handle for the toilet (to replace the paper clip attached to a string being used to flush at the moment), 87,960 felt chair tips (so Charlie can have something to do tomorrow, meaning I will get to pack more shit), packaging tape, a door stop (she has 489 of these, but wants one more.  Just for the sake of having me carry something else), and a new countertop.   4:49pm - Leave Home Depot with everything but the countertop, because they have to order it.  Stand in parking lot and ponder decision of which WalMart to go to.  Groan when Crazy decides to go to the smaller, shittier one (not that there are many differences, but one is new and one is old.  The old is shittier).   5:12pm - Arrive at WalMart.  Go in search of another doorstop (because, really, with all the doors in the world, this woman wants them all open), caster coasters, Sharpies, a bathroom scale, and snack food (Crazy is hungry.  She must eat every 4 seconds or she starts talking and the world weeps).   5:47pm - Depart hell (WalMart) for campus.   5:59pm - Arrive on campus.  Argue over where I can and cannot park.  Park where I want to park because Crazy is fucking wrong and I will NOT feed the meters when I don't have to.  She stopped paying for those damn things about a week into starting working for her.  And I have like 2 quarters left in my quarter arsenal that used to be 3 ziploc bags full.   6:02pm - Unload random shit from car.  Realize Crazy wants me to carry 5 boxes, 2 bags, 3 sets of keys, and a partridge in a pear tree up to her office.  Figure out how to manage the whole load and not appear ready to kill her.  Fail at not appearing ready to kill her.   6:08pm - Begin box packing brigade.  This brigade involves me taping boxes shut (I packed them last week), taping mailing labels on, weighing them (and here is where I find out what the hell the bathroom scale is for) and trying to avoid asking any questions.  Questions always lead to more work.   7:15pm - Finish taping, writing mailing labels, taping mailing labels on, and retaping all 3,897 boxes.   7:22pm - Go to bookstore to buy stamps for all of these boxes.  Crazy requests enough $0.37 stamps to send all the boxes.  She refuses to acknowledge the larger stamps that go for $13.85, $5.00, $3.85, $2.00, $1.00, and $0.50.  Girl working counter rolls eyes and puts on smile and starts dishing out $137 worth of $0.37 stamps.   7:32pm - Return to office.  Begin affixing stamps.  Curse Crazy for making me lick half of them.  Wonder if someone has laced them with poison and hoping they did so I can keel over and die (Susan on Seinfeld, anybody?).  Realize I'm not that fortunate.   7:58pm - Finish with the stamps.  Load up to go home.  Realize Crazy wants me to carry a chair, the bags I came in with, two full boxes, a music stand, and a glass of water (because normal people use a bottle -- she uses a dixie cup).  The partridge in a pear tree will have to stay in the office.  Calmly explain to Crazy that I am not making more than one trip, and therefor the chair, the water, the music stand and one bag will have to stay in the office for another day.  Crazy protests.  I leave the office with what I can carry and ask her if she's coming.  She trudges out of the office like an 8 year old who was just told she can't have the toy she wants.  Pouting will get you nowhere, lady.   8:02pm - Load up car.  Crazy still pouting.   8:18pm - Arrive at Crazy's.  Unload car.  Crazy pouts to boyfriend Charile that she wanted to bring some other stuff home.  Charlie sides with me and says she doesn't need them until they're ready to pack up and leave.  I wonder when that will be, but don't bother asking.  No one ever knows.  Crazy pays me.  I gleefully skip down the stairs.   8:25pm - Arrive home.  Open fridge.  Close fridge.  Open freezer.  Grab Ben & Jerry's One Sweet Whirrled.  Endulge.   11:02pm - Decide to make use of my web journal.   And here we are.  Back at the present time.  Some would call that an eventful day.  I call it a day where only one of my jobs occured, but par for the course with Crazy.  And for some reason, I didn't find the need to kill her nearly as often as I usually do.  I think that has something to do with my friends.   For those of you out of that loop, the deal with my friends has not been delved (is that a word?) into on this site, and may never be.  But just know this.  All but two of them lost my respect, but most importantly, they lost my trust.  And once you lose that, you're hanging on to my world by a thread.  It's one thing to spread things I said in confidence around to everyone, but something completely different when you change the story completely and make me out to be something I'm not.   Okay, I promise my next post will not be this long.  I'm sorry.    A bit later...  If you presume you are in a position to judge me, let me present you with a pair of my shoes.  Walk for a week in them.  If you still feel the same way, then you're entitled to your opinion.  I assure you that you won't feel the same way.   So, for those of you missing the message I've been sending out the past week, here it is, spelled out crystal clear.  If you don't know enough about me to know how I will react to your comments (whether you intended me to hear them or not), then you should keep your mouth shut, because you don't know me well enough to utter my name.  Oh, and FUCK OFF!  12:14 am

      NOTE: This was written on Aug 6, but because of my inability to get to this site at the time, I had to hold off.   Alright, I've got my undies in a twist over something.  It's stupid, really.  And I should have learned a long, long time ago to not let this kind of shit bother me, but it continues to after years of experience with it.   A group of people who are friends with each other through me have started getting together more often.  Without me.  My phone isn't ringing.  My email isn't saying "hey, come join us."  Great, they all branched off and made friends with each other.  That really is great.  I really do like that they did that.  But seriously, where do I fall in there anymore?  Do I even fall in it at all?  I'm thinking no.  I'm so far out of the loop I can't even see it anymore, and in rare fashion, it's not even my fault.  It's not like I've been busy.  Hell, I lead probably the most boring life on the planet these days.  It's not as though I gave them the infamous pv-kissoff (you never know it's coming, but you damn well know once it's there, and you don't forget once you've been served).     I've noticed this happening gradually, but only days ago found out that they've been hanging out with each other as a group nearly every day.  How did I find out about this, you ask?  Well, I stumbled into it because of an email that someone had clearly mistakenly sent to me.  It was outlining all the details of their next little get together, and all the fun they have been having (and also included some not so nice, and not so true things about me). If I hadn't read the subject line, I'd have assumed it was actually intended for my eyes.  But it wasn't.  Someone just misclicked their address book while sending out a mass email, and now I'm all kinds of pissed off.   Why do stupid things with my "friends" bother me so much?  I know better than to let people get to me, but damnit, they always do.  This kind of experience is nothing new for me.  Sadly, it happens quite often.  People are careless.  If this one person had paid attention to where her mouse was clicking, I'd still be living my life nearly oblivious to the fact that I've officially been excluded from a group of people that I brought together.  Can you hear that?  It's my jealous side coming out to bat me around for a while.   First of all, I HATE being excluded.  From anything.  Mostly, that stems from my childhood where excluded should have been my given name.  Yeah, for those of you thinking I need to be in therapy, cram it.  I know what my core problems are.  I don't need to pay someone to tell me what I already know.   Second of all, I HATE that I turn green every time I hear about a conversation I should have been privy to, but wasn't.  Some days it's just not my business.  Some things I don't need to know.  But damnit, the anger rises when I find out things third or fourth hand (or because of a blatant error on someone's part).  If I never hear "Oh, I thought she/he/it/they told you" one more time, I'm going to explode.  Yes, I understand when people forget to tell me things.  What I don't care for is when they exclude me from important things that I should know, if for no other reason than not looking like an idiot when it comes up in conversation (and it always does) with someone that would assume I would know this particular detail.   Third of all, I really hate that I gave the actual sender of the email a second chance after she had fucked me over once before.  I don't do second chances, and I made an exception for this girl because she vowed to never do stupid shit like this again.  Well, she did and now I'm kicking myself for even letting her back in.   Here's a little bonus hint for those of you who don't seem to get the rules that go along with being in my good graces.  If I find out something drastically important that I should have been informed of by you, and wasn't?  You'll find yourself so deeply embedded on my shit list, you'll need scuba equipment to survive.  Please note that if I find this information out from someone I dispise, you will find yourself in even worse shape.   You know what else I'm really sick of?  Having to explain myself every time I have an emotional reaction to something.  I am not a fucking robot.  I do turn into a weepy girl every once in a while and I think I'm entitled to it.  I hate that people are shocked by that.  I'm sorry that I don't fit into people's expectations or stereotypes of me.  And even more, I'm sorry that I have to apologize for it.  I hate that people ridicule me for it.  Yeah, I'm a hard ass.  I will scream at you until I lose my voice and then scream at you some more if you make me angry.  I'm demanding, and I'm unapologetic about the fact that I expect people to be smart enough to function on their own.  I'm unforgiving, hold a grudge, and am a bitch sometimes.  But what people don't seem to get is that those are the only ways I have ever been able to find to survive my life.  There is another side to me.  It's just not readily available to the public.   Here you go.  A one stop guide to finding out whether or not I trust you (because evidently that's an issue).  It's really quite easy.  If you've ever seen me shed a tear in your presence and not tell you I have something in my eye, then I trust you.  If you've ever heard me explain exactly (with details) why I am the way I am, then I trust you (and just so you know, there are exactly two people I've written it out for, because I don't talk to them in person).  If not, well, you haven't given me enough reason to trust you.  This does not mean that you cannot be my friend.  This only means that I don't trust you enough yet to give you those kinds of things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to trust people until they give you reason not to.  Not in my world, you don't.  You earn it.  And until you earn it, you don't know shit about me.  You can go ahead and presume you know enough.  But I can assure you that you do not.   Okay, now you can disregard this entire post, because I'm in such a foul mood that I would imagine it didn't make an ounce of sense.  It probably targeted people that didn't deserve to be targeted.  Because I'm in such a shitty mood, I'm not even going to go back and find out.  So suck on that for a while (as if it mattered to any of you at all--don't worry, I'm not so self-deluded to think that people read this and scurry to make any changes in their life, and I'm also not delusional enough to think that these aren't my problems--it's no one's fault but mine that I get stupid about these things).   I take it all back.  These things don't piss me off.  At all.  They make me sad.  And that emotion is the one that pisses me off the most.  So really, I'm pissed off at myself for being sad because some people are inconsiderate dumbasses.   Next up is the August contingent from the old site so it all gets in the archive.  Because I'm anal like that.

      You all should be seeing some changes around here in a few days.  I have a big ole long rant all tricked out and ready to post, but because of this lovely (but not) switch Earthlink threw at us, it will have to wait.  For details on the reason things will change around here, see the front page.  The images, the archives, the transcripts, the whole fucking thing is uneditable with this new system they have us on.  I need a drink.  And some sleep.

      Okay, here's the deal. This site is going to be going through some changes. Or not. Why am I unsure? Because earthlink is switching servers and webpage creation companies, so some of the options I have now, I may or may not have when the switch occurs. This switch is scheduled to occur sometime between August 5 and August 8. Why such a long period of time, you ask? Well, who the hell knows. All I know is that if I do any updating or anything to the site on or between those dates, any changes I make will be lost. Into the great world wide abyss. So, gather yourself, people. It'll be okay. I didn't disappear. My site may for a few days. My graphics may. My content, the tell me, will not. If it does, oh fucking lord they have a world of hurt coming their way. Yes, I've backed things up. But, BUT, it takes a million and a half years to upload it all again, SO, if I have to spend a whole day doing that, I am not going to be a very happy camper. On that note, on with the show.    Here's a little quiz. Meaningless quiz, but something to do to keep you occupied for about 2 minutes.   your song is "Sleep All Day"   [there used to be a link and a graphic here.  It ran away]   Which Jason Mraz song are you? brought to you by Quizilla    Yeah, so that wasn't an unexpected outcome for me, especially since I kind of like that song, and who wouldn't want to sleep all day, right? Yeah, I know I would, but I also know that will never happen unless I'm unconscious. It's happened before. It wasn't fun.    Speaking of fun. Yes I was. I just got back from the best concert of the year. Okay, it was the only concert of the year that I've been to, but it counts anyway. I went to Minneapolis to see the Counting Crows/John Mayer concert. Very good. I'll get into more details when I'm less tired and sweaty (what is UP with this damn air conditioner not running at night? The sun goes down and the bitch things it doesn't have to work anymore? I don't think so!) But the condensed version of the story is that I won some kick ass seats and some even ass kickinger (I know that doesn't make sense. Save yourself the trouble of telling me later) backstage passes. Yeah, that's right. I was backstage with the man, himself. Fun, fun, fun.    Okay, must sleep now. Sleep has been lacking for the last few days. I miss it. I love it. I have to have it. It's like a drug that makes me love it more. Sleep is good. I think I once said "I'll sleep when I'm dead." Okay, so I said it like every day, but you know what? I find that I scream less when I get more sleep. I'm doing the world a favor, really. And if not the world, at least my friends and neighbors. And that's all that really counts, no? Okay, so it's not, but whatever. Fuck it. I'm going to bed. You should, too.

      Someone tell me not to yell.  Please.  Why are there so many clueless damn people allowed to breathe on this planet?  They're mucking up the air with their useless breathing.  Stupid people will be the death of me.  I swear!   But, aside from that, things are going really well in my life right now.  I know it's shocking.  And because things are going so very well, I'm not going to talk about it here for fear of jinxing the whole thing.   I could still use a job, though.  This 2 mornings/week thing isn't really cutting it.  But the fact that the dumb management company I work(ed?) for did actually scrape together enough money to pay me was a relief.  It kept me from a life on the streets for a month or two.  So, I've got a little time before I'm back in dire need of a new job.  I just don't want to have to wait until it's dire to have something land in my lap (because you know, as hard as you try, it's the second you stop trying so damn hard that good things happen--jobs included).  My printer is exhausted, though, from all the resume printing.  It actually sent me a memo yesterday telling me it needed a few days off.  I, being the kind and giving boss that I am, am letting it have a few days off, and will treat it to a new ink cartridge once it returns to work later this week.  Okay, I'm just a big dork.   So, there you go.  An update.  Isn't that what this thing is for?  Because I usually forget its here, so sometimes I'm rusty on the reasons behind my having it.  2:59 pm

      Wow.  For some reason, today seemed harder than last year.  There weren't as many TV specials, there weren't as many things around to remind me, but somehow, it was still worse.  I woke up to an alarm clock this morning, something I haven't done for nearly a year.  I decided to set it so I didn't sleep through the morning tributes.  The moments of silence, the kids saying the names of all the victims in New York, the dedication of the stained glass windows at the Pentagon, the bell tolls for the passengers on Flight 93.  I'm not ready to sleep through those things yet.   So, groggily at 7:12 this morning, I got myself out of bed (normally, I'd have been up for at least an hour by then, but until my hamstring is better, I have no reason to be).  I was tempted, on human instinct, to hit snooze and roll over and go back to bed.  I didn't do it.  I was reminded why I needed to get up when the radio came on and was playing "God Bless America."   I turned on the television just as they were ushering the flag that hung at the WTC the day it crumbled.  I started sobbing.  They showed the WTC falling.  I continued sobbing.  After the moment of silence for the second plane entering the second tower, I made myself leave the room.  I came back just in time to see even more footage of the towers falling.  Then the voice of a little girl, reading her father's name off of the list of those lost in the attacks, began to crack, and you could see her begin to cry just a little.  I lost it.  I had to turn away from the television.   Last year, I sat glued to my television all day, somehow wanting to see all of that all over again.  It was sickeningly comforting to me, and to this day, I don't understand it.  This year, I caught bits and pieces.  And every bit and every piece was gut-wrenching.   Maybe it's because we all seem so removed from it now.  Last year it was still raw in our minds.  Last year, we were still recovering.  Last year we were still seeing a bit of the unity that this horrible day a year earlier had spawned.  This year, things have moved on.  Things are back to "normal."  Politicians are at each other's throats again, people are back to foregoing the kindness and just being stand-offish.   I actually found myself saying "it doesn't seem so bad now" in reference to remembering the day itself.  My brain has told me that this is no longer a big deal.  It just hasn't been able to get that message to my heart.  My heart still hurts.  It's an internal battle.  One that may never be won.   I've heard several New Yorkers say that today was eerily similar to that day two years ago.  Crystal clear blue skies, sunny, and gorgeous.  It was like that here, too.  Both this year, and two years ago.  And like two years ago, it is supposed to rain here tonight.  I remember two years ago it was as if the Earth had decided to cleanse itself.  Maybe that's the feeling I'll have tonight if it rains.  Maybe not.  I guess only time will tell.  7:55 pm

      At 8:46am, there will be a nation-wide moment of silence.  No matter where you are at that time, stop what you're doing (even if it's sleeping) and remember all of the innocent lives lost in those terror attacks, all of the heroes of Flight 93, all of the men and women lost fighting the war on terror, and all of the men and women still fighting to protect this great nation.    11:04 pm

      I don't know what just hit me, but all of a sudden I'm feeling reflective on a few things.  Oh, wait, I know what hit me.  The news did a little segment on new-found footage of the WTC attacks.  All of it comes flooding back every time something like that comes on television.   It's almost two years, now, since that day.  It seems like a few months and a lifetime ago all at once.  How many times have you answered "the question?"  You know which one I mean.  The one that is some form of "where were you when life as we all knew it, changed."     So, where was I?  I was in the hospital, two days removed from a knee replacement.  The nurse came in, woke me, and turned on the television just a few minutes after the second plane went in.  I called my best friend in Seattle and told her to get up and turn on the television.  While I was watching the footage, with my best friend on the other side of the country on the telephone, the second tower fell.   After that, we knew.  We knew nothing was ever going to be as it was.  After three sleepless days in front of that television (much to the chagrin of the doctor--he told me I needed to sleep), I finally turned the television off.  It was the same images over and over and over again and every time I watched those buildings fall, I felt sick.  To this day, when I see that footage, I get chills.   Once the nation started moving forward again, one thing brought tears to my eyes, over and over and over again.  The national anthem.  It was merely a song on September 10, 2001.  By September 12, 2001, it was something special.  It held a much deeper meaning to all of us.  To this day, it still sends some chills up my spine and puts a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye.   I don't know about you all, but I've been different since that day.  I can't get on a plane without wondering if I'll be on an ill-fated flight.  My priorities changed, too.  Before that day, I was all about being the best.  Making the most money, having the best job, having everything everybody else always wanted.  After that day, I wanted out of the responsibilities.  I didn't want to work at my high-paying job anymore.  I didn't need that much money.  I didn't need to deal with people that I didn't feel like I wanted to know.  I just didn't need what was going on in my life anymore.  A few months later, I quit my job.  Just walked out.  A day and a half later, I went apartment hunting back where I went to college and found the place I live now.  Two days after that, I called my old coach and begged to work for the team.  I made up with everyone that needed making up with and wrote off those that I didn't need to waste my time on anymore.  I just made clean breaks and went back to where I was happiest.   Do I regret any of that now?  Not one single thing.  I did what was right for me, and what I should have been doing all along.  And, to be honest, I think that's why I recovered so quickly from that knee replacement (and the variety of other surgeries and injuries I endured from the accident).  I was in a positive environment and I was happy.  It took a national tragedy for me to give me the push to make all those changes.  It shouldn't have had to take that, but it did.   I did lose someone that day.  I don't talk about him, because in my mind, it cheapens my memory of him.  But he was a very close and very dear friend of mine, who gave me much more than I ever deserved.  For that, and so much more, I will be forever grateful to him and his beautiful family.     What was my point of this whole entry?  Well, there really isn't one, but maybe you'll sit back and maybe you'll think about how things were before and how things are now and maybe you'll notice the change in you, too.  8:39 pm

      Hey all.  I'm letting you in on a little secret.  It's a hidden track off of the Australia release of John Mayer's "Bigger Than My Body" single.  It's called "Tracing" and, in my opinion, it's the best thing to come out of Mayer since "Comfortable."  Will it ever be released here in the states?  Who knows.  But since I have my hands on it, you can hear it right here for a limited time only (bitch takes up massive amounts of bandwidth).   Listen. Share your thoughts. Hopefully you enjoy it. If not, for the time being you can turn your sound down on your computer.   Or, hell, maybe it won't work at all.  It should be playing as the background music to this page. If not, you'll have to send me an email to get the link for it.  The little email form is located at the bottom of the transcripts page or you can just do it manually by emailing me at pvrunner01@earthlink.net. Be sure to include your email address if you use the form.  You can also use this if you'd like to download the song for yourself. And the RIAA can go fuck itself, because Mayer approves of this sort of thing. His music, his right to decide how it's distributed.    Later...  Yeah, I can't get it to play for me, so if you want it, you're going to have to email me.  It's worth it, so get to typing that email!  12:25 am

      So last night was the first night in about a month that I've actually fallen asleep and not woken up about every 45 minutes.  Granted it was about 2:30 when I finally went to bed, but still, it was good sleep--none of this restless crap I've been dealing with for the last three weeks.  So it was looking to be an actual peaceful night's sleep.  And it happened to be the same night that we turn back all the clocks, so there was potential for an extra hour of sleep...something I'm in desperate need of.  Notice I said "looking to be."  5:45am.  Some asshole, who owns one of the buildings across the parking lot, decided that 5:45am on a Sunday morning would be a fine time to start construction on the building.  Saws, hammers, crowbars on wood, breaking glass, and construction workers yelling obnoxiously loud at each other.  5:45am!  All of this noise?  Because they're replacing the windows in the building.  Now, great, that's good if you live there.  For those of us that don't (and most of the people that do), 5:45am on a Sunday morning is NOT the time you want to be awakened by some jackass construction workers (who don't know that 5:45am on a Sunday in late October is not really the time to show up to work without a shirt on--it was approximately 18 degrees out there at that particular hour of the morning).   I was not the only one screaming obscenities at them out my window.  I heard it come from at least 8 different people from 3 different buildings.  It didn't do any good, but it did prove that these fools were not aware that the clocks switched back today, so they thought it was 6:45am on a Sunday morning.  And somehow, that seemed like an okay idea to them?!   Here's a little guidance for the dumbasses of the world.  Just because you're awake at what you believe to be just a bit before 7am (we'll forget for a second that it was actually just a bit before 6am), does not, under any circumstances, mean that the rest of the goddamned world wants or needs to be up at that particular time of day.  Now, I'm used to being up early on days that aren't Sunday, but in no way to I believe anyone else should be or wants to be up that early.  Which is why I go about my business before 10am very quietly.  I don't make noises that can wait until a reasonable hour (which to me is 9am, but often waits until 10am just to be safe).  I don't wash my dishes before then--the pipes make obnoxious noises, the dishes make noises, and I am not genetically able to be in the kitchen without making obnoxious amounts of noise (my mother does this, my grandmother does this, and from what I hear, my great grandmother did it, too).  I don't do laundry before noon, because the washing machine is downstairs and will disturb the sleep of the guy who works the late shift and doesn't get home until 4am.  Unless I have to, I try not to use the shower before 9am, partially because the pipes are loud and partially because the hot water doesn't regenerate from the early morning working people's use of the hot water until about 9am, and cold showers are not my idea of a good time.  I don't vacuum until afternoon because my vacuum is loud, and I get pissed off when people use theirs when I'm trying to sleep.   Just a little common courtesy, people!  It's SUNDAY!  Around here, some old woman is going to come up to you and tell you that you're making baby Jesus cry because you're working on the sabbath.  Trust me, they will.  It's something I can assure you that my grandmother has already said to 4 farmers she saw in the field on her way to church this morning.  It's what they do.  They're old and they're Christian.  Don't make them angry.  They'll lecture you into submission and make you cry in the process.  Just put the saws and crowbars and clumsy ass construction workers (who've dropped no fewer than 4 windows and broken them in the past hour) away until it's a decent hour.  Or until it's not Sunday anymore!   Another subject entirely:   Warren Sapp.  Shush, man!  Dude, everything that happens to you does not have to do with race.  People want you to be quiet and not call the commissioner of the NFL a slave-master.  Slaves were not paid.  Slaves were not richer than 97% of the population.  And guess what, just because you're a black man, does not give you the right to call anything negative that happens to you, racially driven.  No, it's not racially driven that you got fined for "accidentally" bumping an official.  No, I don't agree with the fine, and I don't believe you intended to bump him, but I do believe that you had it coming.  You've been doing stupid shit for quite a while, and the NFL is pretty much sick of it.  You were not fined because you're black.  You were fined because you're a repeat-offender.  A white man in the same position would have gotten the same fine.   And sadly, it's all about money.  Billionaires arguing with billionaires makes those of us that don't have million-dollar contracts, hate you even more.  And Tom Jackson on ESPN just said it best.  If you don't like your boss (the NFL/NFL commissioner/team owners) enough to bitch incessantly about it?  Find a new job.  No one is making you stay.  Go play in the CFL.  I hear NFL Europe is hiring.  Why not try the low-paying Arena League?  Go get an office job where you make about 8-10% of your former salary.  I don't care how good you are as a player.  If I'm your boss and you go around calling me a slave master, then I'm firing your ass.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Your refusal to be respectful of authority is enough reason for me.  Those of us living in the real world wouldn't get away with it, and because you make more money than god, shouldn't mean you should get away with it either.   So, Warren Sapp.  SHUT UP!  The more you talk, the dumber you look.    Later...  Okay, I just heard the complete interview with Warren Sapp.  My comments above were pertaining to the last 30 seconds or so that I caught when I flipped to ESPN.  Well, guess what?  He wasn't talking about anything racial at all.  Well, maybe he was, but that wasn't his primary gripe.  He was pissed off because the NFL will not allow him or any other player to promote themselves on the field.  His arguement?  Professional football is about the players, not about the team.  In the words of Gilbert Godfried in "I Love the '80s...Strikes Back", WHAT THE FUCK?!?!  That whole "there's no 'I' in 'team'" apparently doesn't apply to Sapp.  Just ask him.  No, dumbfuck, you shouldn't be allowed to promote yourself on the field.  You should be allowed to do one thing, and one thing only.  Play football.  If you're busy telling the world how awesome you are, then you're not playing football to the best of your ability, which is what you're being paid for.  No, Warren Sapp, you should NOT be allowed to do anything you want on that football field.  No, the game is not about the players.  The players should be about the game.  And on the field, the players should ONLY be about the game.   And then he made the assenine comment that football is the most popular sport in the world but that nobody knows the players.  Um, Warren?  People outside of this country don't give two shits about football.  Well, I take that back, they do, but we call that sport 'soccer.'  Perhaps he's confused by the dual usage of the term 'football'.  Soccer is more popular globally.  Baseball is more popular globally.  Hell, basketball is more popular globally.  American football?  Is just that...AMERICAN!  Nobody outside of North America knows the players because nobody outside of North America cares even the slightest about the players.  It has nothing to do with the fact that you wear a helmet.  And trust me, Sapp, here in America, people know who you are, and they know your face because you're on television every 5 minutes bitching about something or other.   I don't know, but if I'd been Michael Irvin and been conducting that interview, I'd have bitch-slapped you for that 'slave-master' comment.  Because the way you went about explaining yourself told me (and others) that you didn't know what the hell you were talking about, and calling your boss a slave-master was just an uncalled-for low blow.  You said it yourself that you just meant it was because they're your authority figure.  Not because they treat you at all like a slave.  The look on Irvin's face was one of shock and a little bit of disgust.   So, I'll say it again.  Just SHUT UP!!  If you want more positive press, stop acting like a three year old who got his halloween candy taken away and play the fucking game.  Knock somebody's head off, then keep your helmet on, refrain from the stupid celebratory dancing, get your ass back in the huddle, and play. The fucking. GAME!  11:17 am

      Can I just lop off my legs?  Just above the knees would be great.  Seriously.  I've been helping out with the volleyball team for the last two weeks, and it turns out that the doctors were probably not just being cautious when they told me to steer clear of sports that involve much jumping.  My knees are in serious pain.  SERIOUS pain!  Like they've been throbbing since the alumni game and no amount of ibuprofin makes any difference.   But, back to the volleyball part of things.  I've been helping with dig drills (which involves jumping about 75 times in two hours) along with another former player and another former player who is also an assistant coach.  It appears to be paying off, despite the fact that they dropped a match this weekend (one that they should have won).  Now it appears we'll need to work on serving and continue work with digs--they're finally decreasing the number of dig-related errors, but they're not passing them where they need to be.   Hopefully, they'll get their game back to the way it was earlier this season before November.  There are two major non-conference games at the beginning of the month that we must win if we want to go to the NCAA tournament (yes, that's how badly this team has been playing lately), and we absolutely must win the rest of our conference games.  And then we must win our conference tournament.  A month ago, that may not have even been thought to be an issue.  But the level of play has dropped off so dramatically that it's an actual concern now.   Another subject entirely.  Since I was all lazy last week and forgot to post it, Happy 80th Birthday, Opa!  You're the coolest guy I know!  12:16 pm

      Alright, this is the third, and last, post of the day.  I hope.  But I just wanted to let people know that the alumni game is tomorrow night.  I will be playing, along with Fridge, HVH, KK, KMac and Shonee.  Coach is playing, too.  And my guess is that many others will commit before the match starts.  It's at 6:30 and it's free.  Be there or be square.  Rumor has it that Eich will be back as well.  I would assume Maya will be there too, since she's still in the area.  Schnek was also mentioned, but not confirmed.  It's gonna be a sloppy game (KMac and KK are the only ones that I know of that are still in playing form--and KK will wipe the floor with the rest of us, what with her national team trained skills), but it's gonna be fun.  I, for one, can't wait.   Who's taking bets on which of us goes down to fatigue or injury first?  My money is on me, because (full disclosure) I'm already injured--I'm sure that shocked no one.  But, um, my second choice is HVH.  It'll be just like old times.  She can get taped up while I medicate and then we can switch.   And for those of you who have no idea who or what I'm talking about, feel free to skip this.  8:02 pm

      You know what I'm sick of?  I'm sick of people who think it's okay to say that I'm a bitch, just based on my appearance.  You know, I'm sorry that my being thin and in shape offends people, but it's not like I just sit around eating bon bons and entire cheesecakes without a bit of effort to work it off.  I work my ass off for this body.  Literally!  And you know what, I'm one of those sick people that enjoy working my ass off for this body.  Hate me for that.  Call me a bitch for that.  But don't call me a bitch because I happen to be thin.   I was at the store this morning, minding my own business, buying some toilet paper and I passed these two girls in one aisle and doubled back into the next aisle to scope out the coffee.  I overhear (from the next aisle over--so they were by no means quiet about it) one woman say to the other, "God, she's such a bitch.  She thinks she's better than the rest of us because she's skinny.  I fucking hate skinny girls like her."  And for confirmation, the other girl says, "Yeah, you know who that was, don't you?  She used to be an athlete.  What a bitch."  So, right there, it's confirmed they're talking about me.  I didn't say a word to either of these girls as I passed them in the cereal aisle.  I didn't even look at them, really.  I'm just minding my own business, trying to buy some tissue and some coffee and I'm getting roasted by people I've never met, let alone spoken to.  Now, if you've had a conversation with me and still hate me, well then that's fine.  At least you have something to base it on.   I'm just sick of people treating me one way, just because I look a certain way.  If my minding my own business was so damned offensive to those two girls, why didn't they say anything to me?  Why was it my responsibilty to talk to them?  I don't know them.  They don't know me.  And you know what?  I get the impression that had I offered to buy them their entire cart full of items, they still would have thought me to be a bitch.   Know what else?  I don't judge people on their appearance.  Not until I've been given a reason to dislike the person will I even go to their appearance as something to nitpick on.  Yeah, that's right, I admitted it.  If I don't like you, I will certainly hit you with a low blow every now and then.  At least I'm honest about it, because I know that pretty much every human being does that.  They can deny it if they like, but they do it.  But back to the subject, I don't give people a judgement based on their appearance.  Would people be less abrasive to me if I put on 40 pounds?  Probably.  And that's really fucking sad.  Why should I have to be curvy and less fit just to avoid people making comments?  And I know this is the reverse of what overweight people go through, but no one seems to address the other side of it.  And you know why that is?  Because even the sheer mention of it pisses people off.  Well, if you live with it, you know it's there.     I've even had someone say to me (and actually mean it) that they think people like me are just out to make flawed people feel bad.  Those were her words, not mine.  "Flawed people?"  What?  I've got a list of flaws longer than my inseam!  I've got self esteem issues, just like everyone else.  I'm sorry, but statements like that just make me crazy.  So people think that because I'm tall, I'm blonde, and I'm thin, that I'm just out to make people feel like shit about themselves?  Well, if that's the kind of things we're all thinking, then why is it that I don't feel like people who are wealthy are just there to make me feel bad for not having any money?  Oh, I know why.  It's because it's not something I would even think of.     You know, I'd gladly swap places with either of those girls from the store for a few days.  From the sounds of things, they think my life is all sunshine and roses and it's a personal affront to them.  Well, I haven't seen much sun or many roses.  If you happen to see either of those, could you maybe point them out to me?  12:39 pm

      Did you read that last entry?  The one where I kind of was saying that I was fine?  You know what?  I'm not fine.  I put up a good front, but I'm not even close to fine.  And you know what I would normally do in a situation such as this?  I'd pick up the phone and call Ryan.  I've picked it up three times today already and then remembered.  I should just take his number out of my cell phone, except his is one of two numbers I know by heart, without hesitation.  Taking it out of the cell phone will do no good.   I should have stayed at his house.  I shouldn't have come back here.  I should have convinced him he could use the hidden spare key to get into his house so he didn't drive back to the office.  Either that or I should have convinced him to take the long way from the office instead of the tunnel.  I should have done something that would have kept him out of that damn tunnel.   I should have told him the truth when he asked me that damn question back in August.  He knew I wasn't, and I knew I wasn't, but neither of us did anything about it.   And I shouldn't be mad at him for dying, but I am.  I'm so incredibly angry and so unbelievably sad that I can't even stand it.  12:36 pm

      That title is more my mood than anything.  Because it's certainly not silent in my world right now.   You see, the man that I've talked about quite a bit on this site (though not nearly as much as I could have) was killed in a car accident a week ago tonight.  He's gone.  I made a big deal about saying how my life was going quite well last week.  It isn't anymore.  My world changed.  A lot.  I'm keeping my last thoughts of Ryan and all of that emotional stuff private, but I will share with you all the way my last few days have gone.   His family isn't doing well.  They're not dealing with their grief well at all.  So badly, in fact, that I have taken on all the duties usually related to the family of the deceased.  I planned the visitation.  I planned the funeral.  I notified people.  I am now in charge of dealing with the bill-collectors and the other people that have to be informed that their services are no longer needed.   Do you know what that last little bit entails?  First of all, most companies on this planet don't have any measures in place to deal with those that die.  They don't have anything in their system to deal with it.  Nothing at all.  Second of all, actually being able to deal with these sorts of situations is near impossible if you're not a blood relative, next of kin, or spouse.  I am none of the above.   One of the businesses I'm dealing with is local to our hometown.  The person I spoke with on the phone to deal with this situation was AT the funeral.  He was standing less than four feet from me at the burrial.  He shed at least one or two tears.  He tells me on the phone that I need a death certificate to prove he's dead.  So actually seeing the body wasn't enough for him?  This is refuckingdiculous!   Trying to get the phone shut off is really an issue because this is still in his late wife's name.  He couldn't get them to switch it to his name after she died.  They wanted HER to call in to have it switched.  How exactly does that work?  I don't think they have phones from the great beyond.   In less depressing and annoyed news, I now have fish.  Ryan had a huge aquarium and he treasured those fish.  I couldn't bear to let the poor little guys starve to death, and no one else could take them, so they're here now.  And they make this place a little happier than it was before.  I think it has to do with the sound of the water.  Or maybe it's that there's another living thing in my apartment.  I don't know, but I'm glad I have them.  6:53 pm

      You know what's funny about that statement?  It reminds me of my freshman year in college.  There was this girl that used to burst into my room, plop herself down on my floor, and exclaim, "Let's talk."  She'd say this whether she actually had anything to talk about or not.  Just her phrase of choice.  Well, I take that back, she always had something to say.  The girl talked more than any single human being I've ever come across, but there may or may not have been a particular topic she was throwing out at whoever happened to be in the room.  I kind of miss her.  I didn't miss her before, in fact, I didn't really enjoy the girl, so I don't know what this is all about.   She was this over-achiever, too many irons in the fire, always heading up some committee or other, and just everywhere you looked.  If she hadn't become an RA our sophomore year, she really really really wanted to live with me.  I have to say, I was thrilled that she got the RA position, because the thought of living with her made me just a little bit anxious (not to mention that if she had lived with me, I never would have met my roommate that year, who I absolutely adore).  I am a fairly laid-back person (I know, some of you find this a little hard to believe, but it really is the truth).  She was very loud and very involved in everything and really got pissed when any of us would blow off anything she had planned, but never understood that while she may have taken hours upon hours to plan something, she never asked if we wanted to do anything, just came to us at the 11th hour and said "you will [insert activity here]."  So, in other words, pushy.  She never understood why I couldn't just drop everything and do whatever she wanted whenever she wanted.  I didn't have time.  Her philosophy was that if she could make time to do something, then obviously everyone else could, too.  Nevermind that I scheduled my day so meticulously that I knew exactly when I had time to go to the bathroom, and often, if not informed of an activity a good three weeks in advance, there was no way I could fit it in to my extraordinarily full schedule (this is what happens when you're focusing on two sports, 16-18 credit hours and pulling a near-full-time job).  But, I gotta say, she was good people.  She always meant well.  And from stories from her roommate, she was actually a lot more low-key than she was when others were around.  And I also know that's true, because when I was going through some not so pleasant (read: scary as fuck) things, she was always there for me to talk to instead of be talked at.  So yeah, she was a good egg.   I lost touch with her after I moved out of the dorms, but the last time I did talk to her was when I heard her intentions to run for Student Body President.  She called me up to see if I thought she could win, and I really thought she could.  The girl was all heart, and the most level-headed person amongst the candidates that had already thrown their hat in the ring.  I remember telling her that if she decided for certain to run, that I'd publicly back her and put a good word in for her with everyone I could, and I also remember her crying because it meant a lot to her.  I hadn't spoken to her in more than a year, and she still was that invested in our friendship that she was affected by my support of her.  I also recall her begging me to be her running-mate, and I turned her down flat.  Politics is not my cup of tea, and there was absolutely not enough time in a day for me to play that game along with the other four (2 sports, work and school) I was invested in.   In what came down to a difference of a dozen or so votes in a run-off election, she didn't get the job, but there was certainly no one more qualified for the position than she was.  Unfortunately, as an elementary education major, it's a hell of a feat to run a decent campaign against a political science major.  The guy that won didn't find anything wrong with mudslinging, and paying people off, and he was rewarded with the job of dealing with the Regents on a weekly basis--which, as far as what I've seen recently, is not an appealing job at all.  This guy was so busy ass-kissing that he neglected to put up a big fuss about the biggest tuition hike in the history of the university.  The student body was not overly-happy with their decision.  The guy was not re-elected the following year, and my friend didn't run again because she was student teaching.   So my point (I usually have one, don't I?).  If any of you out there have any idea where I can find Liz Green, could you drop me a line?  I really want to talk to her.  I heard a few years back she was having a rough time and I want to get back in touch with her to see how things are going.  6:34 pm

      Why?  Why am I so damn tired, but cannot, under any circumstances, find a way to sleep?  There is a gaggle of people here and they're all sleeping.  Me?  Typing with one eye open, but completely unable to get any sleep.  Whatever it was that had me feeling like ick on Thursday has gone away, so it's not that.     Which makes me a little bit happy because once the ick went away, I got to see my friends and we've been having a lot of fun.  You'd be amazed at the kinds of hijinx we can get into in this little corner of the world.  Tonight, I witnessed a group of 10 or more grown men jump into a lake fully clothed just because they all dared each other to do it.  I don't anyone of them actually expected any of them to do it, but, dude, a dare is a dare.  They seemed completely unphased by the fact that it was not even 35 degrees outside.   This was, of course, after the football games of the day.  Holy shit, was it a good day in the world of football.  Okay, so Iowa State lost.  Again.  To Kansas.  But, other than that, it was spectacular.  Iowa won and virtually assured themselves a New Year's Day bowl.  Michigan won, but more importantly, Ohio State lost to Michigan, thereby throwing their ass out in the cold as far as the national championship game goes.  No way in hell did OSU deserve to be there this season.  Last season it was debatable.  Yeah, they won last year, but they didn't even win the Big Ten outright, how do they then have the right to say they're the best team in the land?  They don't.  Because I said so.   You know what.  If I didn't adore JM so very much, I'd be about tired of seeing this special on MTV.  This is the fourth or fifth time I've seen it in the last two or three weeks.  It's good, don't get me wrong, but I could put the thing on mute and give you the entire show.  Verbatim.  To be completely honest, I also have it on tape.  Because I'm obsessed.  It's a sickness.  BUT, in my defense, I taped it because I wasn't sure when it re-aired and I wanted to see it.  I had no prior knowledge of this insomnia bullshit that has been plaguing me.  AND, I now know that it's actually better than this big over-hyped performance on Austin City Limits.  I know this because while I was still awake last night, I watched that (because it finally aired here).  Now, I'm not saying ACL was bad, I'm just saying that it wasn't quite what I'd pictured with all the hype surrounding it.  Buddy Guy was phenomenal.  The few songs they aired were great.  But it left me unsatisfied.  Kind of like when you just eat one potato chip--because we all know you can't eat just one.  There needed to be more; the show needed to be longer.   Okay, in my quest to sound like the biggest hypochondriac on the planet, I have to say that something is wrong with my arm.  Something bit me or stung me or something right near the elbow-pit and it itches and kind of stings like a mo-fo and its driving me a little bit crazy.  You can only scratch for so long.  If I could find my bag o' wonders with all the weird little medical items that I rarely/never use, I'd be able to put some goop on it to make it stop itching.  But, I can't find it.  What's up with me not being able to find shit around here?  Seriously.  My place isn't that big (well, it's bigger than most, but not that big), and there isn't a ton of storage, so how do you misplace a queen size comforter bag full of first aid type crap?  I just don't understand.  I've looked in boxes (yes, I still have boxes in my apartment from when I moved here more than a year and a half ago), I've looked under my bed, I've looked in drawers, I've looked in storage containers, I've looked in the medicine cabinet (I know), I've looked in the backseat of my car.  I've looked EVERYWHERE!  No bag.  Now, I know the bag is here, because I've used items from it since I moved in.  But I've looked everywhere for it to no avail.     In other news (there's always other news--we should just accept that as a fact of life), the heat that some days I believe is fixed is now not fixed and it's really fucking hot in here.  On the eve of the first winter storm to rumble through here, I should not be sitting here with a tank top and shorts on while sweating and watching the temperature guage on the thermostat continue to creep up.  My guests are all sleeping sans-blankets (I'm still not clear on why they're sleeping on my floor instead of on the nice soft comfy beds at the already-paid-for Ramada, but whatever).   Someone remind me that I HAVE to get groceries tomorrow.  Because 24 hours more without coffee and I'm probably going to kill someone.  Well, that and I just finished up all the pasta in the house, and in this house, that's a disaster--especially now that it looks like I'll be making the race-eve pasta dinner for all the people that don't actually need the pasta (coaches are so needy sometimes).  Oh, and because I honestly have absolutely no edible items in the house.  I have a container of sweet and sour sauce, ketchup, a clove of garlic and three gallon jugs of water in the fridge--and that's all.  The freezer has bags of ice in it and some Arm & Hammer.  The cabinets have a lot of spices, olive oil, sugar, some paper plates, and a container of Country Time Pink Lemonade.  Yes, I am going to have to go to the store tomorrow, no matter what.  I can't even make excuses.  I really hate grocery shopping.  I hate it even more on weekends.  And even more than that when I know there are thousands of extra people wandering around because of this NCAA meet on Monday (let's just say it's not terribly common to see a group of girls wandering around wearing Carolina blue track suits--hell, it's not even common to see a group of anybody wandering around wearing panther purple track suits, because we never did and they still don't).  And I know where all of those people will be.  They'll be clogging up the aisles of SuperTarget.  And that?  Will not make me happy.   What did make me happy?  Getting to get an early look at the NCAA course and give it a good run-through before anyone else.  That kicked all sorts of ass.  And the course will, too.  Especially when it gets nice and muddy (which it will because of the spectacular weather we'll be offering these nice kids from out of town--24 degrees with lots of wind and some possible snow, after a solid three days of rain).  Nice and goopy.  My early predictions for the winners (based solely on who everyone else is picking, because I haven't paid any attention to any runners not on the team here this season): Flanagan and Ritzenhein will win.  Shit, from what I hear, Ritz loves running in the shitty conditions.  The shittier, the better.  He wouldn't let this course beat him (it's not a difficult course--at least not when it's dry).  And Flanagan is, well, she was good last time I saw her run a few years ago, so I assume that hasn't changed.  Well, that and the consensus of the sleeping people in the room tell me that's who will win.   Okay, there's a Figi's catalogue tormenting me.  I need to go look at that and listen to my stomach growl because it's not being fed any yummy chocolate.  3:10 am

      Not necessarily.  It might actually kill me.  I just read this article in Elle magazine (yeah, I read it, and I also grumble about the price of the items featured in it) that now gives me factual permission to tell the next person that tells me that to shove it, because there is now evidence that it'll shorten my life.    Two Cheers for Pessimism Lauren Slater, Elle Magazine December 2003   We all know that Cheerful, optimistic people fight off illness better and live fuller, healthier lives--right?  Well, not exactly.  According to Lauren Slater, a landmark psychological study is shaking up the happy consensus.   Stop smiling.  If asked how you are, feel free to say, "Not good."  Go ahead--sit with the lights out, or better yet, just stay in bed.  The melancholic among us may finally be getting a break; new research suggests that, contrary to popular belief, pessimists may tolerate stress better, and live longer, than their cheerful chums.   Over the past decade or so, we've been regaled regularly with yet another study touting the virtues of yet another positive personality trait.  Optimism, happiness, and laughter are said to make our minds sharper, our bodies stronger.  Oft-cited research done in the mid-1990s at Ohio State University found that women who report having higher levels of stress heal more slowly from puncture wounds; other studies have detected more robust white blood cell activity in optimists than in pessimists.  Psychologist Martin Seligman has made a name for himself by promoting optimism and its link to success in school, careers, and relationships.   Given the proliferation of evidence that cheerfulness is good for you, why on earth would anyone question the fact?  No one did.  What happened was that researchers analyzed life spans among 1,200 gifted children who were first identified by the renowned Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman and whose "life outcomes"--relationship patterns, personality traits, career success--have since been tracked for almost seven decades.  The findings were shocking: Those subjects who were rated cheerful as children tend to die earlier than their less bubbly cohorts (by several years, according to subsequent calculations)--and those who were the most cheerful (even though they by and large remain so) die earliest.   Psychologist Leslie R. Martin at La Sierra University in California recently led a study to determine why.  Her hypothesis: that the early mortality among the cheerful Terman subjects is due to their tendency to drink and smoke more or to engage more in other risky behaviors and activities.  But the data didn't pan out: Cheerfulness seems to be a mysterious, so far irreducible predictor of a shorter life.   Martin's team isn't alone in calling into question the merits of good cheer.  Wellesley College psychologist Julie K. Norem has written in praise of "defensive pessimism" and has conducted empirical work on the phenomenon.  She theorizes that pessimism can provide important buffers in life.  For instance, anxious people set expectations low and anticipate how to cope with the worst possible event, should it happen--which, of course, it too often does.   "Concern about the lifelong health of children who are low on cheerfulness is unwarranted," conclude Martin et al.--music to the ears of those of us who have been trying for years to lighten up for the health of our hearts and minds.  And yet, how much should we take this message to heart?  "It's certainly not enough to overturn the mountains of opposite findings," says Philip G. Levendusky, the director of the phsychology department at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.  But, he adds, "it's possible that pessimism is more complex in its effects on lifestyle and life span than we thought."   Martin believes we need to refine our thinking; "Excessive optimism is clearly bad for you.  You think, Hey, I don't have to wear this seat belt, and then your car crashes.  On the other hand, a small dose of optimism is probably good for you, and defensive pessimism--as opposed to catastrophic thinking--is probably good for you too."   So should the cheerful be brought down a notch or two?  Probably not.  Belief in the power of positive thinking is quintessentially American; the right to the pursuit of happiness is written into the Declaration of Independence.  And if we do cast our lot with the power of pessimism, what are the implications?  Should we pull back our self-esteem-building curricula, withhold antidepressants, and try to tamp down the natural exuberance of children?  I celebrate my child's blithe spirit and hope it lasts.  Who could really choose otherwise?   Down the street from my house, two restaurants recently opened side by side.  One is a health-conscious, lean-cuisine kind of place that serves soybeans and silken tofu topped with cilantro.  The other offers your usual tasty fare: barbecued chicken, glazed and crisp; mashed potatoes whipped with butter and cream; salads topped with curmbles of blue cheese.  The first restaruant has a sign in its window: EAT HERE, LIVE LONGER.  The second also has a sign in its window: EAT HERE, DIE HAPPY.  Both are always crowded with customers.   So, yeah, all you nausiatingly cheery people out there, you're going to die before me.  And that?  Makes me smile.  And laugh a little.  Oh, damnit, I just lowered my life expectancy.   12:46 pm

      The title of this entry is the exact noise my stomach has been making this afternoon.  I don't like that.  I don't like that at all.   Normally, I can ignore the noises coming from my stomach (there are many, and often, they've been known to entertain those around me), but combine it with the fact that I'm so incredibly tired, that I'm typing this with my head on the armrest of my chair because I could conceivably fall asleep in the middle of writing it, and I'm just not happy about it.   I'm supposed to go out with some of my friends who are in the process of flying in right this very minute.  But these same people cannot, under any circumstances, afford to be sick, so I'm afraid that, even though I haven't seen these people in about a year (three in the case of two of them), I shouldn't go.  I don't want to infect them with whatever this bug is that I might have.  Maybe I can hit them all before they leave town Monday night and/or Tuesday morning, but until then, no fun party hijinx for me.  Poo.   Hmm, here's something new.  I'm ice cold.  That can't be good.  Maybe I'll have to schlep myself down to the doctor's office.  Yes, I know I said I was probably going to do this at the beginning of the week, but I put it off and put it off and I just don't really want to go.  Much hate for the doctor.  No, I love my doctor, just hate the process and reasoning of going to see him.  Did I write about this last week?  I think I did, so I won't do it again.   I guess I'll just throw myself on the couch and see how that goes.  If any of you over campus-way are reading this, someone bring me some chicken noodle soup from GA's.  I'll even tip you.  And I'll give you the beer in my fridge for your troubles.  4:08 pm

      Alright, I've been sitting on Quizilla for about an hour doing random quizzes (people keep sending me more emails for more quizzes and now I'm addicted).  This, of course, is more proof that I have no life.  Or that I'm easily amused.  Or both.  Or neither.  You decide.   But, anyway, here's the latest....    You are Form 0, Phoenix: The Eternal. "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire. He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal." Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun. As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual. You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations. You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.   [this used to be a picture and a link.  It left]  Which Mythological Form Are You? brought to you by Quizilla    Is it just me, or when you think Phoenix, you think Stefano on "Days of our Lives?"  I'm trying to decide if that's a good or a bad thing.  Both associating a quiz/mythical creature with a soap opera, or the fact that a soap opera is the first thing I thought of, even though I'm well-versed in mythological figures (and have been known to rattle off some random mythological fact at random times during random conversations).   I haven't yet decided, but I might be doing a quiz-a-day thing to post here for a little while.  There's absolutely nothing going on in my life right now (at least not that I'm talking about), and I'd hate to have this cute little blog (it's not really that cute, and I'm aware of this) just sit here and get all dusty while waiting for my next crisis, pity party, or basket of roses to come along.  And who knows, maybe somedays (today perhaps?) we'll have more than one quiz.   Is it obvious that I've run out of things to do for the day and there's nothing on the idiot box to distract me?  I have about 4 hours as of right now to do absolutely nothing before anything with the potential for interest occurs.  Practice was short today (hence my being home and doing nothing for the last hour), work was uneventful this morning (why do I even go anymore--I'm back working the phones, and they don't ring, so really, all I do is stare at the new computer they set up there that I jerry-rigged to the network without their knowledge so I can at least play games on yahoo all morning), and I've seen this Trading Spaces is probably an episode I've seen 4 times before.   It's something I actually haven't said in months (and this is a shocker to anyone that knows me)---I'M BORED!   Okay, here's what I don't get (look everybody, a rant--aren't you excited?).  Why do homeowners on Trading Spaces choose rooms that need absolutely nothing done to them?  And why do the producers select both Kia and Frank for the same episodes?  It's like guaranteeing that a lot of people will hate both rooms.  And Kia with her wallpaper borders and rearranging makes me want to vomit.  What is up with these two homeowners?  Both of them have televisions bigger than my living room (and for those of you that've seen it, you know that's saying something).  And you're telling me that they want a room done for $1000 or less?  Sell the TV, Frank!  You'll more than double your budget.  Then maybe you can pay someone else to paint the chickens and vines on the wall.   Swiffer commercials amuse me.  If for nothing more than the fact that they are entirely unrealistic.  First of all, who cleans (even with just the swiffer) wearing a sweater set, chinos and full makeup?  Second of all, who, aside from the speed-freak moms of the world, dance around like they actually enjoy it?  No one I've ever met.  And no one I ever hope to meet.  Are you kidding me?  I throw on some music and some sweats to clean, but I can assure you that there is no dancing and there is no makeup.  Hell, if I'm cleaning (and I mean really cleaning--none of this sweeping and calling it a day), I'll roll out of bed with full-on bed hair, no shower and bad breath.  I clean my house, then I clean me.  It makes sense to me.  Am I alone?  I don't think I am.   You know what else I've been doing today?  Trying to get on to one of the jmftps.  For those of you that think I just went all eye-chart on you, it's a John Mayer FTP server, so I can see if there are any shows of interest there for me to download.  Unfortunately, the server is so full of people that after 2 rounds of 40 tries each, I'm still not logged in.  It's on try 30 of round 3 (at least it has auto-retry).  Yes, I have become quite the obsessed fan, but unless you've seen him live when he's having an "on" night?  I don't want to hear another word about it.   For the love of christ!  The Asian Lady Beetle infestation has been particularly annoying this year.  They just don't ever stop.  Because the weather just doesn't ever decide to stay cold.  It's in the 60s today.  They're back, and in a big way.  They're buzzing all over my ceiling.  I've tried using the Dust Buster.  I've tried soapy water (they said this would work on the news).  I've tried my grandma's tried and true End-a-Bug.  I think they liked it.  Nothing stops them.  NOTHING!  They're just incessant.  Won't leave me alone.  They just. Won't. QUIT!  I'm about thisclose from setting off a bug bomb in here and dealing with the fumes that linger and make me ill for weeks after.  It's not like they bite or anything, but when they're just in and on everything, including your person (try waking up with them under your shirt and tell me how you feel about them), it's like someone pissed off the lady beetle population and they've come to exact their revenge on the entire human race.  They fly around and clink off lights when I turn them on and drive me absolutely batty!  This morning, they pushed their luck a bit.  One of them flew directly into my coffee.  My "must have it must wake up will die without it" cup of coffee.  Normally, I'd have made more.  BUT, I was OUT of coffee and had emptied the grounds into the garbage by this point.  I was absolutely FURIOUS!  I mean, I don't go into their little dwellings (where do they dwell, anyway, aside from my house?) and disturb their morning routine.  The worst I've done to them lately is flick them off of my hand because they not-so-invitedly landed there while I was trying to brush my teeth.  Come on, guys.  Just leave me be.  Go bother someone else.  I'm begging you, please, for the love of all things great, go back outside and stop harassing me.   Whew.  Okay, just had to get that off of my chest.  3:31 pm

      Yeah, so you know that feeling you have just prior to a really big, really exciting event?  You spend so much time being so completely and totally excited that you lose all site of everything else, and the bad stuff just doesn't seem so bad, because, hey, look, there's this huge cool thing going on and it's all that matters?  Yeah, that was me last week (and honestly, the week before).  This week?  Depressed.  I have nothing really exciting to look forward to anymore.  So what do I do with that extra time and energy?  I have no friggin idea, and that, my friends, is the problem.   This happened after the last Mayer concert I was at, too.  The next two weeks were just....ugh.  Of course, there were more reasons at that particular time, but still, same results.  I've been listening to the CD and checking various sites for the tapers like it's going out of style.  And then I read reviews of other concerts of his that have happened since, and from the sounds of things, Ames was the best.  Columbia got a killer setlist.  Iowa City got some songs I'd hoped to hear (and apparently Holly brought cookies, and I'd give my left foot for one of her cookies).  But Ames had a better show.  How come I can put my CD player on repeat, but I can't put my life on repeat so I can relive that concert over and over and over and...well, you get what I'm saying.   I could say that during that show was the happiest I've been in months, but that wouldn't be true.  Things aren't going badly for me right now.  And haven't been for the last couple weeks.  I'm actually, dare I say it, alright.  I hesitate to actually say that outloud, because every time I've said it in the last few months, my whole world goes wonky and drops me square in the middle of a brand new game.     I'm also *gasp* seeing somebody.  Yeah, I didn't think it'd happen that quickly, either, but it was a very pleasant surprise, and I'm absolutely thrilled.  I'm not going to talk about him on here, though (aside from this), so don't come in here looking for details.  You won't find them.     My new favorite coffee shop: Santa Fe Espresso in Ames.  Cutest little place I've seen in years.  And they have Snicker Lattes.  Shit.  You can't beat that kind of thing.   Yeah, I don't know why anyone wants to know that, either, but I told you, so there it is.   It wouldn't be me if I didn't gripe about something, so here it is, my friends (does anyone even read this thing anymore?  nevermind, I know some of you do because I got a handful of emails answering my questions from the last entry--thanks for paying attention guys, I do appreciate it).  So, anyway, my eye is twitching.  Same eye that twitched for about 3 solid years of college.  It's either from stress or lack of sleep, usually, but the difference now is that I'm not stressed--not any more than usual, anyway.  And I get sleep, but I'm always tired, so maybe that's it?  I don't know, but it's driving me the kind of crazy only I have the ability to be.  Just twitch twitch twitch all day long.  I don't know if it still does it while I'm sleeping, but by the time I've wiped the sleep goo out of my eyes in the morning, it's already twitching away.  And it twitches until I've lost consciousness on the couch.  I don't get it, but I suppose if it keeps up (and this constant tired feeling keeps up), I should go to the doctor and find out what the hell the problem is.  But I hate the doctor.  Well, I don't hate him, he's a nice guy, I just hate all the crap related to being at the doctor.  Tests, lectures (because I never follow doctor's orders when it comes to something physical), recommendations, more tests, and then, of course, the bill.  I really don't like the bill.  My insurance sucks all kinds of ass (because I can't afford it to not suck--my theory is that at least I have insurance, because that's something I considered not having, and then remembered my pension for getting injured--good call on that one, since I stopped working, I've been injured about 3,907 times), so the bill that comes with any doctor visit makes me all kinds of angry.   Oh, hey, and speaking of stopping working (and by working, I mean a job that I actually consider a job and not a collosal waste of my time), at the end of this month it will have been a year.  Great.  That makes me feel really good about things.  Oh, who cares.  No, really, who cares.  Life just doesn't always go the way you'd like it to, and if you can't roll with the punches, you're going to land on your ass when life sends a right hook your way.  So, keep your fists up and land a jab when it's got it's guard down.  You'll feel better.  I promise.   Son of a bitch, I think I'm getting a cold on top of this sleepiness and twitching.  NyQuil, I'm coming for you!  10:37 pm

      Whew, I'm sleepy.  And strangely, I've actually been getting sleep, so I shouldn't be sleepy.  It seems like when I actually get sleep, I am more tired than when I go three or four days with minimal sleep.  Makes no sense at all.  Par for the course with me, I'd say.   This weekend was friggin great!  I've seen many concerts in my day and this Mayer concert was, by far, the best one ever.  And yes, it even outdid the Mayer concert I saw this summer.  It was two hours of pure, unadulterated bliss.  Or in my best friend's opinion: FUCKING PHENOMINALLY AWESOME!  Because in our world, everything worth putting an exclamation point at the end of, deserves a 'fucking' at the beginning and all caps.  It just does.  This is something one does not question.  Because it is what it is.   The show was in Ames, and the venue was Hilton (gave a new meaning to 'Hilton magic').  You could tell he was actually very happy to be there (which cannot be said for the Target Center in Minneapolis--but let's face it, no one is ever happy to be at the Target Center.  It's just too damn big for a concert).  And Ames is one hoppin' little town when it wants to be.  At least for a town in Iowa.  And last night?  It totally wanted to be.   First of all, let's just get this out of the way, Teitur was great.  Much better than his opener for the Minneapolis show this summer.  So great, in fact, that Jamie purchased his CD and we played it most of the way back here and loved every minute of it.  I didn't buy it because I'm broke, but I would have if I could have afforded to.   The set was right up there with the best arangement of songs I've ever been witness to.  Just kind of flowed just right and had a good combination of new and old material.  Not too much new to alienate the people that were too cheap to buy the new album and not too much old to...nevermind, there can never be too much of his old stuff.  Started out with "Bigger Than My Body" which was the appropriate starter--current single and upbeat to get the crowd into it.  Followed that up with the uber-hits (at least in my head) "Why Georgia" and "No Such Thing."   Then came the new stuff.  First up was "Wheel," complete with horn and sax, and then "Clarity," which is, in my opinion, the best song on his new album.  Then into "Something's Missing," which is on the new album, but one of his less new "new" songs.  During this song he started talking about how you have a bunch of numbers in your phone, but on any given day you can go through them and pretty much deem that they all suck, so you call the person that sucks the least.  He encouraged us all to not call that person because there's a reason we stopped calling them and there's a reason they suck, so don't bother.  I didn't explain that well, but it was totally something I was doing about two days before.  Just flipping through the phone and not finding a damn person in there that I really had any desire to talk to, but I wanted to talk to someone, but...well, that's a whole other entry, and I'm not going to bother with that story.   Then came "Daughters," to which Jamie gave a big "huh?" to.  She doesn't have the new CD.  She'd never heard this song before.  She had no idea what he was talking about.  Probably because she missed the first bit of the song while she was getting some beer.  Upon listening to it in the car on the ride home, she deemed it a good song.  She's got good taste.  Usually.  He threw in "3x5," which I didn't expect, so it was a nice surprise.  One of my favorites off of Room for Squares.   Next up was "New Deep," which sounded great and led into "Your Body is a Wonderland," which had all the girls screaming and the flashbulbs popping off like crazy.  Not my favorite song.  But he joked that it was about espionage before he started playing, so, you know, I can get into that.  Who doesn't love a little espionage, right?  Right?!  No?  Just me?  Okay, nevermind.   Then came the highlight of the night.  "Come Back to Bed" was just phenomenal!  He played his way through it and riffed and was enjoying the hell out of his solo and it was just amazing.  You could tell he was loving every single second of that song.  And of course, he gave the obligatory 'thank you' for letting him take his time with that one.  He closed it up with "My Stupid Mouth" and "83."   Of course, as with any show, there was an encore.  The encore was great.  He dusted off "St. Patrick's Day," which was great to hear and unexpected (at least by me).  He brought out Scotty to play the bells on that one, and Scotty topped himself in the wardrobe department.  Even from my seats that were seemingly up in the sky, he looked like he may have gotten dressed in the dark.  But it's Scotty, so it works.  After the song, John called him over to show us their handshake, which was essentially made up of every awkward, strange, messed up handshake they could think of on the tour bus that day, but it was good for a laugh.   He closed up the night with "Back to You," which I also didn't expect, and it sounds like he hadn't played it in a while (I could go check old playlists, but I'm feeling a little lazy) and was enjoying it.   Just a downright great show.  And what was really great was after the show he was roaming around signing autographs.  I'd met him up in Minneapolis (radio contests rule, y'all), and was shocked (shocked, I say) that he remembered me.     It was a total fluke that we even ran into him.  You see, Jamie got herself a new car, so we drove that down to Ames.  Well, in getting her new car, it no longer stands out like a big old shiny beacon in a group of other normal cars.  So, yes, we were wandering around trying to remember where we parked.  Turned out that I was right, but the door we went out (her third opinion of where her car was--I should know by now that her sense of direction sucks rocks, but I let her go with this one) was no where even remotely close to where we'd parked, so we went back in the building and I don't know what the hell we were doing, but we went up some stairs and down some stairs and found ourselves wandering the underside of Hilton.  Impressive and quite maze-like.  Great fun.     We finally found ourselves by the locker rooms.  From there, I could figure out how to get out of the building through the bus-deck (having used this exit a few times, myself).  We finally get to the door and there stands the band.  And all their crap.  We had to stand around and wait for them to move it so we could get out and in our waiting, down the hall comes John.  First thing we had to answer (after having been asked by the crew) was how the hell we got past security and got down there.  Well, if you get lost enough, you don't even see security to tell you you're not supposed to be there.  And then once John got down there, we had to answer why we looked so damn familiar, to which he replied, "Oh, yeah, I remember you guys."  I wish he'd been kidding, but he wasn't.  He recalled something particularly lame that I said shortly after meeting him, so yeah, he wasn't just saying it to be nice.  Which is totally sad, because we're not all that memorable and he has been touring for damn near ever, so he should totally not remember two girls he met at a backstage post-show radio promotion.  Apparently, we're so lame that we're memorable.  At least that's our theory.   Anyway, he asked where we were sitting for the show and whether or not the setup was good for those seats.  During the show he'd made some comment about having taken his guitar and gone up to the nosebleed seats to see what it was like up there, and he nearly "shit his pants."  We told him that those were the seats we were in, and they were, indeed, decent for viewing the show and getting all the sound and blah, blah, blah, blah.  We commended him on the video projection screens, because at least we could see the people on stage.  Had they not been there, we wouldn't have been able to see the infamous faces he makes throughout his performances.   He asked if we were going to make the trek to Iowa City for the next show, and we replied that we were not because we couldn't afford two shows, and Jamie had to head back up to Minneapolis so she could work on Monday.  I said that if we were handed tickets to go, she'd have called in sick.  She disagreed, but she totally would have.  He said they were still readily available, but didn't take the hint to give us free tickets.  The availability of tickets is sad, because Carver isn't that big, and it shouldn't be that difficult to sell it out.  But, that could have something to do with the area it's in--Iowa City people have a tendency to do everything at the last minute, so they probably sold a load of tickets today.  It also could have to do with the tickets being over $40 with the fees that Ticketbastard charges, and people had to choose one show to go to, and Carver just wasn't it.  After that conversation, a mob of people showed up outside, so he went out to sign autographs and we went out to find our car (which took about 2 minutes once I was given control to go in the correct direction).   So, yeah, yet another great experience at a Mayer show.  Which is just really fucking cool if you ask me (and I'm aware that you didn't).  But now I'm tired, and still wondering if I got in my car right now I could be down to Iowa City in time for the end of the concert and he's staying in IC tonight, so he'll be around.  But then I remind myself that would be stalker-ish, and then I'm not fond of that idea anymore.   Random assortment of topics that I need to talk about but that don't warrant entire entries:  Did you all watch "8 Simple Rules" last week?  I cried for, like, hours after that.  Just couldn't stop with the waterworks.  Did anyone watch the Iowa v Purdue game yesterday?  Was it as ugly as it appeared in the boxscore?  How exactly did Iowa State football manage to go from early season specatcularity (not a word) to totally trashy in less than a season (this refers to last season, but has carried over into this one)?  45-0 is unacceptable.  No matter who you're playing.  What happened to UNI football this weekend?  They totally should have won, but only scored a field goal.  That's not right.  And then the Vikings lost today?  To San Diego?  The hell?  Um, Gordman's is one of the best stores on the planet, but I wish there were more stores and fewer people in each of them.  Raisenettes are the best candy in the world.  Wearing a tanktop when it's 12 degrees outside is not a good idea, and I don't want to hear you bitching that you're cold when you should have known by the fact that you could see your breath outside that it wasn't tanktop weather.  My spaghetti sauce is still the best out there.  Six cups of coffee in three hours will make me just a little bit crazy.  A 2 hour trip can be made in 1 hour and 15 minutes if you remember where to speed, where not to speed, and which roads have no traffic.  My heat appears to be fixed, which boggles the mind, because this morning it wasn't and no one has been in the building today who can fix such things.  VCRs only work if they're set properly.  Britney Spears needs to just go away because her shit is played out.  Alias is still my favorite show and I wish I could kick ass like Sydney Bristow.  Bottled Nestea tastes like feet.  My Yatzee computer game is a big waste of time, but a waste of time that I actually am addicted to like it's a tech-geek version of crack.  I need to eat some ice cream right now, so I'm going to do just that.  8:33 pm

      In approximately four minutes, I  will  change out of my pajamas and finish packing those three boxes I should have finished last week.  I will do it.  Well, maybe after this cup of coffee.  Today is moving day.  Well.  Sort of.  I still have to be here tomorrow, because my landlord is a bonehead and got me all riled up for some damn inspection last Monday, only to call me at about 11:30 to say they decided to wait until the 30th at 3pm.  So, uh, when I have all of my furniture and other assorted crap on the truck, and dad is en route to home with it, I'll have approximately 24 hours to sit around with my thumb up my ass and stare at the stark white walls.  That'll be fun.  You know.  Except not.  Mom's idea was that I should stay in a hotel.  Me, in my cheap wisdom said, "you want me to pay to stay somewhere when I still have a paid-up lease to stay in my own apartment with nice warm showers and no one knocking on my door at 10am for checkout?  That seems silly.  It's like double-paying for that last day on my lease."  Mom, of course, rolled her eyes at me and wandered away.  I get this trait from my dad and she has no understanding of it at all.  That theory that if you spend it now, you can't spend it later on something you might actually need drives her absolutely insane.  My feeling on that is that if I wasn't that way, my brother never would have finished college--I paid for it while still in high school (I didn't plan on it, nor did I know about it until I got to college and had no money).  And had my brother never finished college, he never would have met his wife, and that, my friends, would have been a tragedy, because like I've mentioned, she's awesome.  But anyway, I will be here yet another day after this one.  Of course, I'll be here without anything to keep me occupied (including this here hunk of scraps that I call my computer), so I'll probably go a little more crazy than I already am, but I think none of us will be surprised by that.  Okay, maybe just four more minutes.  And maybe another cup of coffee.  So sleepy.  If I haven't mentioned it before, moving sucks.  Seriously, rappers in Waterloo?  This is Iowa, fool, go elsewhere if you'd like to be taken seriously.  And he calls himself chilidog.  The guy needs some help.  Or I need to reconnect my cable and stop listening to the radio.

      Holy holiday misery, batman.  Someone needs to remove all sweet food from my vicinity before I puke.  Really.  No more holiday desert, no more chocolates, no more sugar cookies, no more mint ribbon fudge.  Just no more.  Give me a box of Alka Seltzer, please.  And speaking of gimmes, I got some pretty cool loot this year.  First and foremost, I got a DVD player.  Now I just need some DVDs.  Someday I'll be ahead of the technology curve.  Today is not that day.  I also raked in the gift cards, which makes me happy, because it prevents me from having to return things.  Then of course there were the standard items of clothing--sweater, sweatshirt, sweatpants, socks.  These come every year.  Difference this year: they fit.  A couple of necklaces also appeared in my stocking, along with a sleve of grandma's chocolate crinkle cookies.  The most exciting present of all didn't actually show up.  My sister-in-law (who is quite possibly the coolest person on earth) had tried to arrange Mr. H under the tree Christmas morning, but four cancelled flights later, he couldn't get here.  It was the thought that counted, and I'd have been thrilled, but I'd have been sad when he had to leave right away, so it's for the best.  I'll have more to say Sunday when I get back to my place, so I may write then.  Until then, you'll find me on the fouton making miserable "I ate too much" moaning sounds.

      Okay, so I'm not moving quite yet, but in all likelihood, this is the last you'll hear from me prior to the move.  Or at the very least, this is the last you'll hear from me out of my apartment in Waterloo.  I hit full on meltdown a few hours ago.  Since then I have gone to Burger King (this is a special treat--post-move, the nearest will be more than an hour away), drank a rum & coke, and watched  Titanic .  I have not packed a single thing more.  Well, I take that back.  I did put another pan in another box, because I discovered the pan in a place I never would have dreamed looking for it--in the oven (I believe it was put in there to catch drips from a potentially overflowing casserole dish (which never did overflow).  Oh, and I pulled a pizza box out from beneath my couch.  Don't ask me how it got there, because I can assure you that I didn't put it there.  Luckily, I saw it while I was picking up random bits of paper on the floor from my gift wrapping escapade earlier today (yes, another means of procrastination).  The end of  Titanic  always makes me cry.  Damn movie.  Good.  Homeland Security raised the Terror Alert to Orange.  Whatever that really means.  Does anyone truely know, anyway?  Oh, and my local news thinks an appropriate file clip to use for this is a helicopter shot of both towers right after the attacks (still standing, but burning and with holes in it).  Do we really need to continue to use those shots, when the news actually has nothing directly to do with the WTC.  Some of us are already somewhat desensitized to those images, but that doesn't mean we should continue to use them when the story is not directly about 9/11.  A better choice would have been footage of the press conference announcing the change in status.  I actually blame this on the overzealous fill-in weekend anchor on the news here.  She's almost famous for using graphic footage when it isn't necessary.  She thinks it makes the story more powerful.  It doesn't.  It just makes us ignore her grating voice.  Look at me and my procrastinating self.  Aren't I something?  You know what would be just my luck?  If my stupid landlord didn't ever get my message, or got it and chose to wait until next week (the days I'm moving) to let the inspectors in.  She would SO pull something inconvenient like that.  And by inconvenient, I mean making me bust my ass to get completely packed so all my shit was out of the way for the inspectors (which was never really clarified--what exactly are they inspecting, and what exactly do I need to do to make certain the place passes for this schlub that is moving in after me--I'm willing to help her out, as long as someone tells me what I need to do in order to do so).  Anybody need extra boxes?  I have plenty.  As in there is a stack from floor to ceiling in the corner that are empty and will remain as such.  If you do (for, say, wrapping large presents, or storing lots of crap), give me a call before noon tomorrow and they're yours.  If you're nice, I'll even deliver them on my way out of town.  I have to stop at the post office, anyway, which is pretty far out of my way, so it won't be a problem.  Either you take them or the trash guys take them.  Heh.  Here's a message from my voicemail this evening:   "Hey, it's mom.  Just wanted to remind you to bring  nice  clothes home for Christmas Eve services.  And don't forget to bring all your presents."   Okay, perhaps that's only funny to me, but you have to hear the tone of voice, and you also would have had to have been privy to a conversation we had this morning where I told her that I was bringing home  all  of my clothes tomorrow.  Mostly because I can't ever decide what to wear, so if I have it all there, it won't be as much of an issue when I feel like a certain outfit makes my ass look big.  It isn't, but we all have those days, don't we?  I just seem to have them every time I have to go to church.  I blame it on church.  And I also find humor in the fact that she didn't want me to forget the presents.  Even though she's aware that I haven't purchased her gift yet (tomorrow night, dad and I will do our annual last-minute rush to find her something that won't make her complain a month from now).  So, anyway, I told her both of those things just a few short hours prior to that message.  Sometimes I wonder why I even speak.  People don't pay attention anyway.    I should go do something productive.  Like put all my hanging clothes in a suitcase.  That should be fun.  Or maybe I should take out the garbage.  Do it now while it's still semi-warm out, I suppose.  There's only seven bags between me and the front door.  That's not bad.  Not bad at all.  [/sarcasm]  So, farewell from Waterloo.  The next time I post, I'll be writing from the smallest town in the world (not literally).  Utopiaville, USA.

      Well, as you can see, I changed the colors on here.  I'm not sure I like it, but I don't completely hate it.  I didn't completely hate the old, either, but military green isn't really my idea of aesthetic appeal.  Really, let's just chalk it up to procrastination and be done with it.  I'm so completely sick of packing that I've found things I never had any intention of doing and used that as an excuse (to no one but myself) for not finishing packing.  Because, you know, changing the colors on my blog is  so  much more important than cleaning out the hall closet (which I haven't open since packing began, so I really have no idea what's in there, let alone what can be packed and what can't be until I come back down here with a U-Haul.    I did get my teaching schedule in the mail yesterday.  I have, quite possibly, the best schedule known to man.  Classes are in 90-minute blocks, and rotate on an every-other-day schedule.  I have class from 8:30-10:00 and 1:30-3:00 every day (on even days I have study hall in the morning and PhysEd in the afternoon, and the opposite on odd days), meaning first and last period.  Bonus for me, as far as I'm concerned.  I have a huge block of time in the middle to get done anything that needs getting done for the day.  And, I can get a good-sized workout in for myself before class starts for the day.  And, and, AND, I co-homeroom with three other people, so my presence won't be necessary most of the time.  Not that it matters, because I'll be there anyway, but I don't have to deal with stupid morning paperwork (which, so far, I've heard every teacher complain about--I have no idea what paperwork they speak of, but possibly student absentee forms?).    Alright, I really do need to go pack now.  The person who (finally) decided to take this place has to have an inspection of it tomorrow (hope they don't mind looking around the boxes, because those will still be here until the 29th or 30th).  I'm not terribly sure why she has to have an inspection, but from the sounds of it, it's a governmental thing.  My best guess is that it either has to do with child welfare (this apartment is not big enough for a child to live in--and there's only one bedroom), parole, or someone on welfare.  But, I admit, I'm not really informed on all (or any) of those things, so I could be completely off-base.  If it's the woman I believe it is that took the apartment, she's a real...well...trip.  She waltzed in here, went  in  my closets and poked around in them,  opened  a few of my packed (but not taped shut) boxes, looked around  in  my medicine cabinet (moved things to look at them), and then informed me that she had the flu, followed by coughing on me.  I've had the throat tickle of impending doom since the day after she was here.  I'm not terribly fond of her.  So, um, yeah, I should go finish packing.  Bleh.

      No, really, it does.  Well, at the very least the Godiva chocolate raspberry truffle ice cream did a decent job of distracting me so I'd stop freaking out.  Of course, it's worn off, but it did it's job for an hour or so.  Whoever had Thursday, December 18 in the pool for when I was going to start freaking out about moving, you win.  Warning: This entry probably won't even be coherent.  Not that they ever really are.  It just hit me last night that I'm leaving.  I think I've been so focused on packing and Christmas shopping that I haven't even had a second to think about what I'm really doing.  And now that I have, I'm freaking out.  I've already half-convinced myself that I'm going to be miserable there, even though I'm aware that I'm going back there to do what I really want to do.  Of course, those of you who know me, know that I do this every single time I move, even when it was when I moved from one dorm room to another.  And it's not like I'll be a million miles away from here.  When I need a hit of sanity, I know Waterloo will welcome me back for a visit.  Two and a half hours isn't that far.  Of course, I said the same thing when I moved to Des Moines, too and I didn't come to visit for seven months.  I think what I'm afraid of is going back there and being as miserable as I was in high school.  Or getting so far out of touch with reality that I don't know which end is up anymore, which is all too often what happens to people in that town.  And what really concerns me is that when I freak out, there's a huge lack of friends there to calm my ass down.  There's no where to go to get away from everyone.  Here I could always just lock the door, unplug the phone and exist unbothered.  I value that kind of thing.  I NEED privacy.  I won't have that anymore after Sunday.  Did I say this?  Sunday is my final day in my apartment by myself.  I'm heading home for Christmas (the weather has caused me to adjust my departure time from Tuesday afternoon) Sunday (maybe Monday morning), and then I'll be there until the Monday after Christmas, when we'll be coming down here to get all my stuff.  And that'll be it.  That'll be the end of my having a spot in this world that no one else can touch.  I've had to segregate my stuff, too.  I had to sit there and decide what of my things I would need in the next year and what I probably wouldn't need.  I don't have the slightest idea what I'll need at home, as opposed to what I need here.  I have like 35 boxes in my living room with two items in each because I don't know what I have to have around and what I can put into storage.  How am I supposed to know all of these things.  And how can I be expected to know.  Hell, I've been living on my own for two years now, I don't have the slightest damned idea what I won't need when I live with other people.  Maybe I like my stuff better than theirs.  Maybe trying to make an egg in one of their pans will send me over the edge and just drop me right into full on crazy.  And really, I'd like to know why exactly my mother has already told me where all of my stuff is going to be in my area of the house.  And why she's told me that I can "have" the rug out of the entry way so that my feet don't get cold on the cement floor.  I hate that rug.  And she knows I hate it.  It's scratchy, it's ugly, and it smells like burning rubber because she once threw it in the dryer.  But it's too late.  She already told dad to put it on the floor down there with double-sided tape.  My real issue here is that I'm going to lose all control I have over any little aspect of my life and I really fucking hate that.  Every piece of mail I get, they're going to ask who sent it.  Every item I buy, they're going to ask why.  Every piece of toast I eat, they're going to complain because they're running out of bread.  Every secret I have has very little chance of remaining as such.  Every phone call I have, they're going to ask who it was.  Privacy is over.  Mom straight up listens in on phone conversations.  Dad's the mailman--he knows what's coming in the mailbox before you do.  And every old person in town is going to be all up in my business before the last box is off the truck.  Let's top this little deal off with the fact that my mother still hasn't frayed completely from her old ways.  She made the comment as she was leaving today that my moving home is giving her an ulcer.  Good way to start it all off, add a little guilt, too.  Thanks, mom.  Point of the story:  I'm terrified that I'm going to be miserable again for all the same reasons I was when I lived there last.  But I do know that I have to do this if I want to get where I really want to go.  It's a good opportunity for me.  And most importantly, it's not permanent.  As soon as something better comes along, I can go if I choose to do so.  I'm not locked in, and in fact, I'm on a semester-ly contract.  I just need to stop for a second and breathe.  And then I need to go see my friends and go to some of my old stomping grounds and have one last look around and things before I head out.

      So, I was talking to one of my friends today.  We were talking about weddings, and inevitably ended up comparing war stories from the bridesmaid front.  I've served my tour of duty in bridesmaid hell, and suspect that I'll only have one more call up on that.  I don't believe it'll be terribly soon, but it will happen (I'm supposed to keep that hush-hush, so you didn't hear it from me--she's afraid of jinxing it).  The final one won't be bad, that I'm sure, because the bride will be one of those "eh, whatever you think" kind of brides.  She's not big on high-stress things, and I could see her flying off to vegas to get married with a group of us trailing along with her.  Don't tell her mother that, she'll flip her lid.  Her mom is destined to be one of those momzillas (as opposed to bridezillas).  She just is.  But anyway, we got off on the subject of our most recent dealings with nuptuals and I am starting to wonder what the hell happened during the last wedding I was at, because since the day of the wedding (14 months ago), I've heard from the bride no more than two times.  One was in the form of a thank you note (impersonal mass-printed thank you note at that), and the second was to tell me she was moving (this was via email, so there was no conversation about anything).  Okay, first of all, a mass-printed thank you note for your maid of honor?  I'm pretty sure there's an etiquette book out there that walks all over that idea.  Yes, she did get me a gift, and I hand-wrote her a thank you note for it, but a mass-printed thank you card?  I don't think so.  Second of all, is she  that  wrapped up in her newly married life that she can't even return phone calls or emails or anything anymore?  She lives less than 5 minutes from me, and I haven't seen, nor spoken to her (on the phone or in person) in 14 months.  I'd just like to know what gives.  What exactly happened that I all of a sudden became expendable?  I've tried emailing her.  I've tried calling her.  I've tried sending hand-written letters to her.  No response.  None at all.  I would ask if this is what happens when people get married, but I know it's not.  I know this because of my assortment of close female friends, only myself and one other person are not married, and we all still talk frequently.  Then again, maybe I should have taken notice at the wedding and noticed that I was the  only  person there (plus my date) that she went to college with.  Maybe I was part of the final purge.  Get one last ride out of the maid of honor to the world and then off she rides into the sunset never to be seen or heard from again.  What the hell is up?  Oh, and what the hell is up when I hear from my best friend that she tried to get ahold of this girl after Ryan died to tell her what had happened, and she never got a return call.  If I didn't know better, I'd say she picked up and left town without a word to anyone, but I know that's not true, because I've run by her house, and sure as I have eyes, her car was there.  That shit just stinks.  And you know what else stinks?  The fact that she's done it to every single person we knew in college.  Just up and stopped giving a shit about anybody but herself.  I don't know why it is that I thought it'd end up differently with me, but damnit, I did.  Call it a moment of weakness.  It won't happen again.  At this point, all I want is to know what made her decide to cast away a 5 1/2 year friendship.  There was no fight.  There was no falling out.  There was not a single thing that happened that I can think of that would have led her to that decision.  I guess that's just a bunch of questions that I'll never really know the answers to.  I'll just deal with it and move on, I suppose.  But really, here's a question that I'd like an answer for: do I even bother to tell her I'm moving?  Is there a point to bothering with that?  Some days I think I should.  Some days I don't.  Today?  I don't.

      I'm so incredibly sick of packing that it may actually make me puke on my shoes.  Nevermind that I'm not wearing shoes, but I'll find some and puke on them.  Seriously, though, every time I move, I think I purge all the crap, but then I have to pack again and realize that there is more crap to get rid of.  Thing is, though, that I'm a lazy sack of crap and don't like to trudge down to the dumpster more than twice and so I end up packing crap that I have no intention of keeping, but merely too lazy to toss it out.  I have almost every issue of Rolling Stone from the last four years.  I kept them because I was always going to do an artsy project with the covers and some of the illustrations inside.  I haven't done it, and I probably will never do it, but I still have an entire bookshelf full of Rolling Stones.  And for reasons unbeknownst to me, I still can't make myself take the damn things to the dumpster.  I am starting to believe that I have inheritted the packrat gene from my grandfather (not my Opa, my grandfather).    I remember roaming around in my grandfather's attic on the yearly visits to his house.  There were piles of National Geographics taller than I was, miles and miles of newspapers, antique furniture everywhere.  When you pulled up to the farm, there were old Studebakers (sp?) littering the yard, and last time I saw the farm, one of them was still there (actually, most of them were still there), except it had a full grown tree growing through it.  As morbid as it sounds, the whole family is dreading the day he dies, because it's going to be a nightmare going through all of his stuff.  See, the odd part about this is that he doesn't live in that house anymore, but all of the old stuff is still there.  He lives with his second wife in the town about seven or eight miles away.  So, the old stuff in there just keeps getting older and covered in more layers of dust and cobwebs.  My dad would be the same way, except about every six months, mom gets on a cleaning spree and throws out everything that isn't nailed down (ask me where my old bed is.  Go on, ask me.  It's in ashes because mom decided to throw it into my grandparent's burn pile because it was taking up space in the storage area of the basement).  Of course, about three or four weeks after the cleaning spree, dad is throwing things around trying desperately to find some random peice of paper that he tucked inside some random magazine or book, only to find that mom has purged it.  You want to see bottled rage, you just have a look at my dad's face while that all is going on.  Looks like his head is about to blow right off his shoulders.  Actually, looks a lot like me just before I start screaming at people.  Except he's got that vein in his head that kind of juts out and makes its presence known.  Those are the times when you just back away slowly with a smile on your face and hope he didn't notice you were even in the room.  I think you all see where I get my rage.  Okay, here's my issue-du-jor of the day.  This Saddam thing is great, and I almost want them to execute him.  And by almost, I mean I really should, but for a single solitary reason, I don't want them to.  The reason being that if you add 20 years to him, thin his hair a lot and color it grey, he'd look exactly like my grandpa (not the packrat--the other one--my Opa).  Especially with the furry beard.  Opa doesn't have it anymore, because grandma made him shave it off, but he really truely looks just like him.  And anyone that resembles my Opa in any way just can't be a bad guy.  And so, I'm torn.  Because I know I should hate him, and I do hate him for all the evil, inhumane things he's done.  But I don't want them to kill him.  Just because he looks like my wonderful grandfather.  Go on, call me crazy.  It's okay.  I already know I am, so it won't be news to me.  Other news of the day: my tailbone is not getting better.  In fact, I'm inclined to say that it's feeling worse.  This doesn't make me happy.  Not at all.  It makes me wonder if it's more than just an injured tailbone, and that, my friends, is not something I need to deal with right now.  What I really want right now is to be able to sit comfortably for fifteen minutes at a time without having to get up and walk around for ten minutes before I can get back to whatever it was I was doing while I was sitting.  Where's that cheese I asked for?

      ***This is a continuation of the last entry***  Yep, the sounds that woke me up impossibly early on a Sunday morning (which has made my Sunday morning seem like it's lasting all afternoon, and will probably continue into evening).  Early Sunday morning phone calls usually mean something very very bad, so I scraped myself out of bed and stumbled to the phone, catching a faint look at the clock on the way.  6:48am, it read.  I don't have my cell phone set to one of those utterly annoying ringtones that oh so many people have.  You know those ringtones that play "Jingle Bells" or "Mexican Hat Dance" or something equally as disturbing to those around you.  Just a plain old ring, that happens to sound a lot like my actual phone.  And strangely enough, my actual phone looks a lot like my cell phone, at least in my half-of-one-eye-open, blurry, just woke up vision.  I picked up the landline phone and couldn't figure out why the damn thing didn't stop ringing.  My cell phone was the one that was ringing, so that ruled out anyone that I didn't know, because I just had my number changed last week, so no one outside of my circle of friends and family have that number (I'm still trying to figure out how telemarketers got the old cell number to begin with).  So, I fumbled around with the charger and managed to pull it out of the wall with the phone still attached to it.  I may have tripped on it, I really don't know.  SO not awake, and I'm so not a morning person (despite my being up very early most days of the week so I can run).  I try to avoid speaking to people prior to noon, because not only am I grumpy, but I also sound grumpy, which doesn't translate well over the telephone.  Anyway, I finally answer it and it's Mr. H.*  Mr. H. is not familiar with my sleeping-in-on-Sunday habit, so I forgive him.  He is in Italy for a while and he'd just heard from his friends that the Coalition Forces had found Saddam.  Having no idea what he's talking about, I nearly hang up, because I'm sure it's yet another of my bizarre dreams (which in the last few days have involved not only the Iraqi military, bombs coming through my living room, and running through the streets of Waterloo (which was actually New York City) trying to escape Iraqi retaliation, but also Osama bin Laden threatening my life because I knew the exact location of the cave in which he was hiding and I was threatening to use that information against him).  So, logically, I just assume it's another dream I'm having and go to hang up.  In this process, I step on the remote, which has landed on the floor after my tirade trying to find and then answer the phone, and the tv turns on to NBC where not-Tom Brokaw is telling me exactly what Mr. H has informed me over the phone.  Saddam has been captured.    I'm still not terribly clear on why Mr. H. thought I needed to know this news prior to my morning coffee, but I think he thought I'd be more excited about it.  Or that I'd be more relieved that my friends in the military have done their job and might be coming home sooner.  It was a good thought, but I don't think it shortens their tour of duty any.  I also think he may have completely neglected to remember that we're 7 hours behind them.    Anyway, he was telling me about the reaction in Italy, and it sounds as though it's all positive.  Which I suppose I would expect, because--and I may be wrong on this--I think they were part of the coalition.  At this point, I don't even remember which countries are pissed off at us and which ones are standing there following The Idiot's bumbling lead.  I know the British are, and I know they wish they hadn't (Tony Blair couldn't appear more annoyed with his life if he tried--but then again, you try dealing logically with people like The Idiot.  I know I couldn't do it).  So, I'm taking bets on how long it will take The Idiot to start throwing campaign ads around with a picture of Saddam in a cage.  My guess is early next week.  Nothing brings in the Christmas spirit like campaign ads.  Goddamned politicians.  Which one of these jokers is going to be the first to use holiday music in their ads, is a nother question yet to be answered.  Note: those ads will probably only air in Iowa, because it's overwhelmingly Christian (something like 97-98%), and they'd only piss off the 2-3% of the population who don't celebrate Christmas.  It's tradition, folks.  Some jackass does that every election year.   * -  Mr. H is the aformentioned guy I've been seeing.  Nickname is Mr. Hypothetical.  I said I would not speak of him on this website, but this is something that I think needs mentioning, so this is the exception.   Sidenote:  These damned Minnesota Vikings are going to be the death of me.  I swear.  They only play like they mean it 1/3 of the time and the other 2/3 they either get lucky, or they get killed.  Today, they're going to be beaten.  By Chicago.  Something like a minute left in the fourth.  The touchdown was in Moss' hands and some damn cornerback took it away from him for an interception.  And now they're going to lose.  They don't belong in the playoffs.   If they get there, they're going to lose in the first round.

      Well, Earthlink went and proved just how stupid they are (or at the very least how stupid the people who work for them really are).  I don't know how anyone mistakes December 31st for December 14th, but they did.  And not only did  they  mess up, but they expected me to pay $15 to fix their mistake.  I think not.  So, I'm suffering through the crap that is AOL until the move.  If you know me at all, you know this pains me greatly.  Because AOL = crap.  Everyone knows this, unfortunately, there are several million who choose to ignore this fact, and thus, AOL lives on.  And for these two shining weeks, I thank those people.  And I also thank the 49,897 CDs that AOL has sent me over the past 8 or 9 years, because in this one very rare instance, they came in handy.  Come January, I'll resume thinking you all are idiots and that AOL is an idiot for spending money on something that 98% of the population uses as a coaster or a frisbee.  I once had to do a presentation for a marketing class in college on AOL.  It was one of those lousy group presentations, but thankfully, it was one of the very very rare moments where I was rewarded with a group that didn't suck.  The professor in that class was evil.  She hated everyone to the point where she criticised each presentation as it was going on, right down to how people had done their hair.  She ripped into almost every group.  And by almost, I mean every group except mine.  We were all over that presentation like white on rice.  I believe there were three reasons for this.  1) We got lucky with our product draw.  AOL was rediculously easy to come up with a marketing analysis for.  Everybody and their dog knows AOL, not only because they advertise everywhere, but also because they throw their software on nearly any other piece of software you buy.  Not to mention they send out those promo CDs.  Whether you use them as coasters, frisbees, or wall art, you know exactly who they are.  2) We showed up looking like the ball-busting squad from some upper-class marketing company.  I'm talking designer knockoff suits (matching black power suits); sleek styled hair; and briefcases.  Our PowerPoint presentation was full of flashy--not distracting--displays and necessary information.  Our handouts were bound (advantage of working in an office where this kind of thing was part of my job--and also advantage that I did it for free).  And, even though this was pure luck, this group was a group of four women who could easily scare the living hell out of any insecure man they ran into.  I would go so far as to say we were a very confident bunch, and I was the least confident-appearing of the group.  And for those of you who know me up close and personal, you know what I'm saying here (read: I have a tendency to indimidate people just by showing up).    3) The ball-busting professor liked absolutely no one in that class (or any other class, for that matter).  Except for me.  She worked in an office a few doors down from me and no one ever talked to the woman.  Ever.  I came across her in the mailroom one day and started chatting her up about absolutely nothing (probably the weather).  This was very early in the semester, and long before she'd given us this assignment (which, by the way, was something like 40% of our grade).  The woman couldn't have been nicer to me, but the mere fact that she was scary to every other student in the world made her unapproachable to everyone.  My group members nearly fell over dead when during some random group meeting I not only waved to the professor and said hello, but I got up and went to talk to her.  I think it was a combination of the fact that she was talking in a civil manner to a student and the fact that she was smiling and laughing while doing so.  I came back to the table, and these other three kind of mumbled simultatneously something along the lines of "we've so got this in the bag."  And it didn't hurt that we went last.  We'd heard every single thing she'd said about every other group.  She taught three marketing classes that semester.  One group got an A on that project.  I don't think I need to tell you which group it was.  She video taped each performance (so she could give more critiquing on it before she handed out the grade), and from what I've heard from others who've gone through that class since, she shows our tape to give the students an idea of a performance that will get you an A.  You know, if I actually didn't hate the sales aspect of it, I think marketing would have suited me just fine as a career.  But I'm pretty sure that coaching suits me better.  And I don't have to wear a suit.  Ever.   Edit:   urlLink We got him!   I'm not sure how it is that I neglected to mention that in this entry when I wrote it three hours ago, but, uh, brain fart or something.  Sadly, I think this probably secures Bush's re-election.  Still doesn't change the fact that the man straight out lied to the country and put our military in danger because of his need to blow shit up.  And it also doesn't change the fact that the rest of the world hates us more than they did before.  It also doesn't change the fact that the man's solution to a down economy was to cut taxes for rich people and somehow create absolutely no new jobs.  I'm glad we got Saddam, but four more years of the Idiot may be too much for me to take.  I'm pretty much over the media coverage of it.  Alright, just tell us we got him and then leave us be.  I don't need to see them inspecting his mouth.  I don't need to know every political analysts views on it.  I don't need to dread another round of desperate Democratic candidate phone calls, only to interrupt me when I least need to be bothered.    They say every cloud has a silver lining, but a lot of those silver linings also have clouds.  Some days I like to focus on the clouds.  Today is one of those days.  My next entry will be about Saddam and how I heard.

      Well, you found me.  Here is where I will eventually call home.  Well, I'll call it my homepage.  No, I'll call it my webpage.  Because it's not really home.  Is anything ever really home to me?  Oh, big subject that we're not going to go into because I don't have time.  Once my Earthlink pages are dead (as in, I can no longer log in there), and I've moved, this is where you'll find my babbling.  Welcome to the new people, whatup to the people who've been with me since the beginning, and uh, whatever to the people that followed me out of a need to bitch at or about me.  Grab a chair and get comfortable, because when I have time, I'm going to make this place great.  Okay, maybe not, but I'm going to fix things up a bit to make them more....me.  Thanks for coming, and check back often.  I may surprise you with the ramblings I come up with.   Edit:  Hey, y'all.  Just wanted to point out that I dragged all the archives over here.  Because I'm a sentimental freak and I wouldn't want to lose those on the slim chance that Earthlink decided to throw my website in the sad abandoned website trash can.

      Shit, y'all, I thought Earthlink might have been going on a pre-emptive strike or something.  I've spent the better part of today trying to log on and tell all you fine people where to find me once this site has become inaccessible.  I was starting to think that Earthlink either didn't like me leaving it so it wasn't letting me get here to tell you guys the new address, or that it hated me so very much that it decided since I was abandoning it, that it would leave me first.   But, anyway, the new address will be: http://pvrunner.blogspot.com/   Go, check it out, I've added a welcome message.  I'll spruce it up when I get around to it.   This, my friends, may be the last you hear from me prior to my move.  It really just depends on when I actually get people together to help me do that.  So far next week and the week after christmas have been discussed.  My padre said he would take time off of work the week after christmas to help me, however my mom has informed me that at any given moment on any given day, they may show up to strip me of my independence.  This is how my family works.  I've grown used to it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't annoy the living fuck out of me.   Until next time, my friends.  If it's next year, I'll leave you with a Happy Holidays.  Enjoy your families, friends, pets, loved ones, privacy, space, loneliness.  Whatever it may be that you enjoy.  If it's next week, well then, I hope you've been doing some Christmas shopping.  Because I haven't and I'm getting a little bit stressed about it.  I have to have one gift in the mail by the middle of next week, nevermind that I haven't bought it yet, nor do I know what it will be.  Sending things overseas sucks, y'all.  If you can avoid it, do.   Anyway.  Like I said before, Happy Holidays!  7:28 pm

      Packing sucks donkey balls.   Do you think it'd be kermudgeon-y of me to go to my neighbor's apartment right now (at 11:24pm) and inform her that her really really bad, really really loud music should be turned down, because it's interrupting my not-watching of SNL?     Is it bad that I'm more annoyed that I can't watch SNL because all Iowa stations have chosen not to broadcast it since Al Sharpton is on it and I guess it violates some equal time rule for political candidates?  Is it really bad that just because of this SNL issue, I wish I had already moved home so I could watch it on the NBC station out of Rochester, MN (home of the Mayo clinic for those of you unfamiliar)?  Because at home, we get NBC out of Des Moines and Rochester, and CBS out of Mason City, IA and Mankato, MN.  And how sad is it that every time I'm home, I feel a little bit neglected because we don't get a second ABC station (because the one out of Austin, MN sucks rocks--the reception is, at times, pretty shitty), but that since I "know" people, we get any FOX station in the midwest that we want because it carries whatever football games we want on Sundays?  Does that make me greedy?  I think it does.   Oh, another thing I won't miss when I move.  The 489 democratic candidates and their campaign camps who call all of us registered democrats to ask us questions and fill us in on their campaign points and the only thing that they don't seem to understand is that the more times they call me, the less likely I am to vote for them.  Wesley Clark and Joe Lieberman are toward the top of my list right now.  Not because I know a ding-dang thing about what they stand for, but because they're the only two candidates who haven't, at some point in the last two weeks, bugged me on the telephone.   Tailbone?  Still no good.  Still not going to the doctor, especially after checking out WebMD and finding that I'm already doing everything any doctor will tell me to do, except he'll charge me for X-Rays, some other random tests and the actual office visit fee.  No thanks, I like to not have to pay for unnecessary things, thanks.   Speaking of paying for things unnecessarily, my student loan people messed up this month and withdrew double the amount they're supposed to withdraw from my account.  AND they withdrew it 11 days early.  Lovely.  Had I not checked my balance online to see what kind of funds I was working with for Christmas, I would not have known this until NSF notices started piling up in my mailbox.  Jerks.  Someone is getting an irate phone call on Monday.  Won't they be happy to hear from me.  I should point out on any contract that I sign as a side note that if they mess up, they won't like the consequences, because I don't like people messing with my money.  Makes me cranky.  Add to the fact that it'll be Monday, and you can up the cranky factor about 2 or 3 times.  Add to the fact that it'll likely be the first phone call they receive on their Monday morning (where the forecast is rain), and I think we can probably expect their week won't get off to a good start.  Not my problem.  Oh, and believe me on this one, if they don't remedy it quickly enough to avoid any NSF fees, they're paying those, too.  Moral to this little story?  Don't fuck with my money.  It's bad for your health.   Speaking of bad for your health, my coffee pot is on its last leg.  Either that or it's just asking to be launched out the window.  What's the deal with it not draining the coffee nicely from the basket into the pot?  And by not draining the coffee nicely from the basket into the pot, once it finally manages to get from water form to coffee form, the bottom of the pot is heavy with coffee grounds.  Some stupid lever just doesn't want to work right, but only when I really neeeeeeed the coffee, and not so much when I'm only making some because I have run out of things to munch on and coffee seems like the next best thing.  I don't like it when my home appliances mess with me.  I blame it on the fact that it's actually my brother's coffee pot.  I only took it because he stopped drinking coffee because it gave him an ulcer.  Well, that and he took my toaster, and now I'm left with his cast-off that grabs hold of pop-tarts and burns the living hell out of them because they get warm and soft and then ooze down between the slats.  Makes that pop tart setting right on the toaster a little misleading, don't you think?   Funny.  In the time it's taken me to write this, someone else has told neighbor-girl that it's time to turn off the bad music.  Good on them.  Probably the old lady downstairs.  The one who's alarm clock goes off every morning from 4:27am until 6:53am.  And who's television is cranked so loud that I could tell you what she's watching at any given moment (at the moment, she's watching a show on A&E).  The same woman who has a terrible case of OCD, to the point where she locks and unlocks her door exactly 26 times before she's sure it's securely locked (this goes for both car and appartment door).  She also has a taste for slamming the same door 26 times in a row.  She has a little bit of love for the number 26.  Because 25 isn't enough.  She's a sweet old lady, though, so I let the fact that she sometimes makes me a little bit crazy slide.  Shit, y'all, she gave me homemade hot chocolate the week I moved in here because she was sure I was getting too cold on my morning runs and needed something to warm me up when I got back in (it was April, and it was still snowy).  Anybody who gives me hot chocolate is on the right track, regardless of the fact that I wasn't too cold on my a.m. runs.     Hmm, now that I think about it, there's a lot of disabled folks around this building (it's only an 8-plex).  The former maintenance man (who once had puppies that were positively adorable, but they've since disappeared, which makes me sad) is now wheel-chair bound (people have been trying to figure out a way to put a ramp on the back of this building for a month now, and they still haven't figured it out).  The sweet little old lady has been in a cast since I moved in, and always walks with a cane.  The guy across the hall has a chronic case of asshole-itis, which I hear is quite painful.  The girl next door must be hard of hearing, because she yells a whole damn lot when she's actually here, and that cell phone ring will be forever embeded in my brain, and I'm not all that happy about it.  The other two apartments that are filled have people in them that I've never spoken to, but they appear to be healthy young men (albeit scrawny--is that a disability?  probably not).  And then, of course, there's me, who is, well, apt to be on crutches, in a cast, or too stubborn to go to the doctor when I know damn well I should because I've injured myself in some way or other.   They should just put a giant handicapped sign on the front door.  Even though no one uses that entrance (especially now that no one ever shovels the snow off the walk out there--shit is slippery, and my shovel has been misplaced (meaning I think it's in the back of Jake's Jeep and I may never see it again)).     Today was a sad, sad day in the world of sports.  Okay, just in my world of sports.  The panther women's volleyball team lost.  To Minnesota in the NCAA second round.  The panther football team lost.  To Delaware in the quarter-finals of the D1-AA NCAA playoffs.  The Oklahoma football team lost, making it possible that they won't play in the Sugar bowl, and instead making it a possibility that it'll be USC versus LSU, and that, my friends, is the biggest travesty of all.  Now, if USC and LSU had lost, it would have been a sure bet that it would have been Michigan and Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl.  That?  Would have made me happy.  But it wasn't to be.  At least Notre Dame got their ass kicked.  That always makes me feel a little better.  And, perhaps the most annoying sports-related thing that happened today?  The Iowa basketball team was supposed to play on television and they weren't on, so I was forced to watch bad television instead.  Ask me what I watched.  Go on.  Ask me.  Answer:  I don't remember.  That's how bad it was.  I'd have felt better about it if I could have watched SNL tonight.  But I think we all know how I feel about that, now, don't we?!   Last thing and I'll leave you all to do whatever it is you were doing before you decided to waste some time reading my drivel.  If you would like to continue reading my drivel after I move, shoot me an email sometime in the next week and as soon as I get something set up, I'll let you know.  And for those of you that don't want me to know you read it, email someone else you know who reads it (or doesn't read it--go ahead and just email anyone, doesn't matter to me) and have them email me to let them know and then they can email you to let you know that I let them know so you can know.  If that doesn't work for you, how about I just promise I won't tell anyone, and I won't bug you if I don't know you (there are a few readers out there that I don't think I know), and we'll just live our lives and pretend you never emailed me except for the one time that I return your email and let you know where in cyber-space I've gone to.  Is that a deal?  Good.  Just make sure you do it soon, but if you wait too long and the email bounces back to you?  Well, try me at pvrunner01@yahoo.com.  I don't check that often (only log on to the account when I'm checking my fantasy basketball scores--where I'm kicking some of y'all's (ouch--that's a gramatical nightmare, right there) ass), but at least I'll have access to it after I jump off of Earthlink's service.   A little trivia for you all (this will be cake for some of you).  Name the one faculty member that Northern Iowa and Hawaii have in common.  scroll down for the answer and short explanation                                 Stan Sherriff.  The actual name of the football field in the UNI-Dome is Sherriff field, named after former Panther football coach, Stan Sherriff.  Stan Sherriff Center is the name of the sports complex (where basketball and volleyball are played, and usually holds the Lakers training camp) on the University of Hawaii campus.  Stan Sherriff moved to Hawaii from UNI to become a beloved athletic director for UH.   See, now don't you all feel smarter, just for reading my online journal-thingy?  Yeah, you know you do.  12:19 am

      Well, folks, I got a job.  Who's excited?  Oh, right, me!  Yay.   I'll be teaching Phys Ed and coaching track (for now) at a high school very close to my hometown.  Close enough that until I'm ready to buy a place of my very own, I'll be living in la casa de la parentas.  Yep, I'm gonna live at home.   Okay, you can pick yourselves up off the floor and return to your chairs, I assure you that was not a typo and you didn't misread it.  The parents and I are actually getting along fairly well at the moment, so the timing is good for this kind of thing.  I'll share more details with you all as I get around to it.   As for right now, I'm suffering from a broken or badly bruised tailbone, and with my distaste for doctor visits, I haven't/probably won't go, because it's not something they can fix.  So, my visits to the online world will be short (in the five minute area of things) because I cannot make myself sit that long, because it hurts like a sonofabitch.  As long as my tailbone has no pressure on it, I feel fine (meaning I can run and jump and play and frolic all I like), but sitting on my ass doing absolutely nothing is out of the question.  Fun.  But not.   Oh, and one more thing.  When I move (this month), I will no longer be an Earthlink subscriber, therein rendering this site useless and unaccessable to me (from previous experience, it'll probably sit here until the internet is obsolete and no one uses it anymore, and it'll continue to sit here after we're all gone from this world).  Chances are good that I'll find another site to use.  Unless I don't.  In which case, well, I guess you'll just have to come back here and read all the fun (but not) things I wrote and think of all the fond (but not) memories.   And my minutes of sitting are up.  So, uh, later.  Unless I get sidetracked, in which case, this could be the last time you hear from me via this website.  7:54 pm

      Alright, midwest folks, who's sick of hearing about the cold weather in the Northeast?  And the snow, too.  Seriously, East Coasters are the biggest bunch of whiners out there, aren't they.  "Oh, it's frigid in the Northeast today!" says the man on the national news.  I look at the weather map and it says that it's 15-35 degrees there (depending on how far north you go).  I look at the temperature guage outside and it reads -8 degrees.  Both of those are daytime highs.  Okay, wherever it was that they were talking about with the 72" of snow yesterday, yeah, I feel sorry for you guys.  But, really, you knew about the lake-effect snow when you moved there and that when it starts snowing, it snows more than two feet each time, so my sympathy for you isn't really all that high on the sympathy scale.  But the New Yorkers who are whimpering when the temperatures hit 15 degrees, and the snow reaches your knees, I say to you this....pffffft!  It's winter.  Get over it.  It's not a news-worthy story.  It's just not.  The only place that has a right to national bitching-rights about the temperatures is the tundra up in Minnesota, where at one point over the last couple days, the daytime high was -38 degrees.  They are newsworthy.  New York City is not.  Go ahead and bitch amongst yourselves, but the rest of the country doesn't want to hear it anymore.  It ranks right up there when people in Southern California bitch because the sun didn't come out for two whole days.  We just don't want to hear it.  These fools would shrivel up and die if either coast had to swap places with the midwest.

      Prompted by an online journal that I'm actually too embarassed to admit I read (because I loathe the person, and only read it to laugh at how dumb she and her friends are), I made a map of states I've been to.  As filled in as it looks, I thought I'd covered more area in my college career, but I guess not.  I would have filled out the world map, except, uh, I haven't ever left the US, so that would have been a bit sparse.      urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide   Looks like I need to plan a trip to Alabama.  It looks lonely all surrounded by red down there.

      And guess who it's directed at.  Mother Nature?  You're a bitch.  This snow thing was fun for like, oh, 10 minutes.  If you would kindly stop further torturing us with the sub-zero temperatures (and no, that's not even with the wind chill).  Oh, and the wind?  That's a fun game you're playing, too.  And while I'm bitching, Mr. Principal and Mr. Superintendant, could you kindly make up your fucking mind about school delays  before  half of the teachers have already arrived.  And when school finally starts, could you maybe just let it go all day?  Because that drive this morning was about the exact same amount of time I spent in class.  And then I had to drive home.  Did you not get the memo that it's a goddamned blizzard outside?  And to the janitors who are in charge of salting the parking lot near the gym (where myself and most of the students park), get your lazy asses up and actually do your job.  My broken tailbone didn't appreciate slamming into the icy pavement upon exiting my car.  In fact, it pretty much knocked all the air out of me and I had to sit there for 10 minutes to get my bearings.  Did I mention that it was -12 when I got to work this morning (2 hours before I needed to be there).  I'm going to go downstairs, make some hot chocolate, and then come back up here and run a hot bath.  Because for once in 4 weeks, no one else is here.  That'll last for approximately 68 more minutes, so I'm going to go revel in it.

      You asked for it and now I deliver.  The survey that has been hounding me for the past week.  See, slowly but surely, I get things done.   Firsts    First best friend:   Ryan  First real memory:  Learning to ride a bike just because my sister did (and learning just by watching her once)  First car:  1987 Chevy Cavalier (also known to many as the shiny red lawn mower, due to the sound coming from the car while it was in motion)  First date:  It wasn't a "date" date, but it was Homecoming my freshman year with Ryan.  And I think we all know how that turned out.  First real job:  Waitress/bartender/beer girl at a country club/golf course.  First screen name:  coop3dog (at least the only one I remember, circa 1998)  First self-purchased album:  Dirty Dancing soundtrack  First funeral:  My sister at age 5  First pet:  Shih-tzu "Cinnamon"  First piercing:  ears at age 4, elsewhere at age 19  First tattoo:  Both a lily and a frog, on my thigh and ankle, respectively, at age 18  First credit card:  Visa when I left for college  First true love:  Ryan  First enemy:  Marcie.  I was in third or fourth grade and this girl said something mean to one of my friends, whereby I kicked her in the shin and called her a bitch.  She was an evil little girl.  First big trip:  I'm told we took a family vacation to Valley Fair in Minneapolis when my sister and I were 3 months old.  First play/musical/performance:  I sang some obscure song for a christmas play in church when I was 12 or so.  I don't remember the song, but I remember I was asked to sing in church monthly, which I opted not to do.  See?  I didn't even like church when I was a kid.  First musician you remember hearing in your home:  Well, technically, it was my brother singing into the vacuum, but he was singing a Kenny Rogers song.   Lasts    Last big car ride:  Today's trip to and from work should count, considering it took an hour to go 12 miles, but I'd have to say the last big one was the 9 hour trip to and from NCAAs in Arkansas a few years ago.  Last kiss:  November 18th  Last good cry:  Sunday afternoon Last library book checked out: My guess is that it was a reference book for a final project in college.  Unless the books I checked out for Crazy count, in which case it was a reference book for her.  Last beverage drank:  Ginger Ale  Last food consumed:  An orange that wasn't as good as it should have been for all the work it took to get the rind off of  Last phone call:  Received from Mr. H.  I called Jamie about 10 minutes ago.  Last time showered:  About 6 hours ago  Last shoes worn:  Thom McAn brown leather slides  Last cd played:  John Mayer's "Heavier Things" (duh--okay, but mostly because I have no clue where the rest of my cds are)  Last item bought:  Some pretty black pointy-toed heels at payless  Last disappointment:  Knowing that screaming at my mother will do no good, so having to sit on my anger until I let it out on someone who didn't deserve it.  And that, of course, made me disappointed in myself.  Last soda drank:  Does ginger ale count?  If not, I'm sure it was a coke.  Last ice cream eaten:  Coconut sorbet with chocolate drizzled over the top  Last time wanting to die:  August 30th, 2001 (but I sort of felt it last October, too)  Last time scolded:  Last Tuesday morning at work  Last shirt worn:  Ribbed tanktop for sleeping  Last web site visited:  blogger.com and symantec.com (I'm a multitasker, especially with the new slough of worms they've been talking about lately, and also because my parents now use this computer and haven't a clue what a virus could do to it)  So, there we have it.  Feel free to pass this little gem of a survey along to anyone else you'd like to harass into doing it.  It's really not so bad, just requires a little thinking.

      Okay, to the 12 people that sent me the survey thingie to fill out to put up here, it's coming.  I actually filled it out yesterday at work, but now that it's a day later, some of the answers have changed.  Oh, and in approximately 4 1/2 minutes I have to begin the prepping frenzy of hair, makeup, and dress clothes that easily could classify themselves as the very bane of my existence.  Why, you ask?  Well, because my mom decided that just because neither grandma or grandpa wanted huge 80th birthday celebrations, we're doing the second in the series anyway.  Tomorrow is grandma's 80th (you may remember me mentioning my grandpa's 80th back in October), so we're having a huge reception-type-thingie at church.  This leads to many many family members showing up and knowing me, but me not knowing them.  And some of these people are driving 6+ hours for cake.  Because all we're serving this time is cake.  I think I'd rather be sleeping.  But the survey is on it's way.  Maybe tomorrow if I get a spare minute.  Maybe Monday sometime.  I emailed it to myself, so it's just a matter of cutting and pasting and changing some answers.  So to the 8 of you who are impatient and have emailed me asking why I haven't done the survey yet, relax.  I did it.  I just haven't had time to fix and post it.

      Okay, so I didn't go to the caucus tonight.  I really just couldn't make myself get all bundled up to go sit in a room for three hours listening to people I have no intention of taking political advice from.  BUT, I'm quite happy to report that Howard Dean only managed a paltry third place finish, and really, that's all I needed to happen to make me happy.  I don't trust him.  He's shady.  More importantly, my precinct was heavily in favor of John Edwards and John Kerry, with no viability for Dean at all.  Even Gephardt had viability in our precinct.  So, again, woo!  Edwards is my man.  He kicked all sorts of ass and that makes me happy, too.  Even getting beat by Kerry isn't a bad thing.  It's all momentum and that's what they both needed (as did the democratic party) going into New Hampshire.  The way I see it at the moment (barring any bizarre happenings in the next few days) Kerry and Clark will start to pick apart each other's voter turnouts and it'll let the guy in third slide through to win NH.  The way I see it, that'll be Edwards.  Yes, Dean is the front-runner at last look, but I think with the momentum coming out of Iowa, Edwards will slide in there and win NH.  If not, I'm perfectly happy with Kerry taking it there, as well.  Ah, politics.  Some days I love it and some days I loathe it.  At the moment, I'm on a caucus high (even though I didn't go).  Oh, and for those wondering, mom and dad made it home from shopping without killing each other.  But they started right in with the sympathy/guilt tug-o-war as soon as they walked in the door.  It wouldn't be right if they didn't, you know.

      You know what?  I kind of liked it better when I thought both my parents hated me instead of each other.  Mom never has a nice thing to say about dad.  Dad never has a nice thing to say about mom.  Both bitch about the other to me, since I'm the only other being in ear-shot.  I get out of bed this morning (my day off, as well as my dad's since he's a federal employee) only to sit down with my cup of coffee and hear fire from both sides.  Mom is bitching about how dad gets angry about everything so easily.  He's a live-wire (always has been).  He gets angry because she doesn't clean the house as much as she should (and trust me on this, she should--it's embarassing).  He wanted to go to Mason City on his day off to pick up some odds and ends to fix some things of his that need fixing.  The man is a live-wire, but he loves shopping and usually likes to go by himself if he gets time to go.  He's a browser.  Never in a hurry, never bothered by crowds and pretty much self-sufficient in a store.  He's a decent shopper (and thrifty, so that's not all bad, either).  Mom didn't want to go.  She was tearing into him (to me) about how he never asks her to go, but just demands she go.  He never does this.  She is under the assumption that he will get angry if she says she'd rather stay home.  He never would--he hates shopping with her.  Now five minutes after mom goes upstairs to get dressed to go shopping, he comes in and plops down and says that he would rather go by himself.  I told him to tell her that.  He said that he wasn't going to because then all day she'll bitch that he didn't want her along.  She would.  He wants to take his car to fill it with gas on the way home (because gas is cheaper over there).  He goes downstairs to change shoes so they can go.  She comes back downstairs and I tell her to change out of her dark sweater, because it's going to get dusty in dad's car (he's a rural mail carrier--everything in his possession is covered in road dust).  She bursts into a tiny fit of tears (something she's become quite accustomed to using on me over the last month) and says she hates riding in that car because it's so dirty.  Probably like dad hates walking into the kitchen with dishes piled all over the counters and never being able to find a clean spoon to eat his cereal in the morning.  Mom has been pulling this shit since the week before I moved home.  She goes and "hides" in full view of me and starts sobbing about anything under the sun and then I'm supposed to feel guilty or feel bad for her about something or other.  It's a new thing every time.  I was supposed to feel bad for her the week before I moved home that she hadn't cleaned the basement to fit all my stuff in there yet.  She had a month.  I packed all my stuff in less than a month.  She works about three days (at the most) a week, and sits on her ass the rest of the time watching television.  She started sobbing the other day after she got off the phone with her mother because her mother was busy telling her about what her sisters and their kids were up to.  She thinks she's unloved.  She had the audacity to whine to me last night about how she hates hearing her parents fight and bicker because she never used to hear it.  And it makes her cry.  I just glared at her.  Dad, on the other hand, uses silence as a weapon.  He comes home from work and goes right upstairs or right to the basement to watch television or eat his cereal and then when he's done with that (he can stand about 20 minutes of tv at a time), he goes elsewhere.  He has a mechanic shop that he used to run where he often escapes to.  He'll sometimes go visit my grandparents (her parents).  Some days he'll go ride his bike (he's a big bike-riding fanatic).  He just leaves.  This is something new since I was in high school.  He used to sit down with the family and be civil.  The only time they interact with each other is when they're in an all out verbal sparring match, where neither ever wins, but both retreat back to their corners and then they don't speak for three or four days.  And somewhere in there, I fell right into the middle of this mess I call a family.  Mom cries.  Dad leaves.  I sit and wonder whether or not I liked it better when they just didn't like me enough to put me in the middle.  All they do is fight, and it makes me curious as to whether or not they've ever considered separation or divorce.  Hell, I'm considering it for them.  They don't like each other, and that's no secret.  Why they keep putting up with each other is a mystery to me.  Surely they don't do it for me, because I could honestly not care less.  Perhaps they do it for my brother, who would likely throw a world-class fit if he ever caught wind of something like that.  Seriously.  Mom, dad, please consider not throwing my dysfunctional ass in the middle anymore.  I have enough of my own issues to deal with, without dealing with their bullshit.

      Who's happy they don't have to work in the morning?  Oh, you already guessed it's me, didn't you.  For the three or four of you who waded through that last entry, I appologize.  It was me pissed off and in a hurry.  Not that there's a lot of difference between me pissed off in a hurry and me pissed off with all the time in the world to ramble on about it, but I could have at least organized my thoughts (or thought about doing so) before I went into what turned out to be a novel-length rant about my job.  What I really should have done is paid attention to the folks who gave me this job who all told me how goddamned aggrivating this man is.  Hell, I dealt with Crazy for months, I figured this guy couldn't be any worse.  He is, except he's not insane and I can't flash shiny objects in front of him and distract him like I could with her.  I'm sure he feels the same about me, because, as I'm sure you're aware by now, I don't tend to back away easily, and when I know what I'm saying or doing is the right thing to say or do, I've been known to be a bit pitbull-ish.  Just the mere sight of this guy makes me spring into defensive pitbull mode.  On a completely unrelated note, the Iowa Caucuses are tomorrow.  I'm in a debate with myself about whether or not I want to go.  I know I should, and I know that in this tiny area, me not going could actually effect the outcome of this whole damned process.  An estimation on my part makes me think there will be a total of ten, maybe fifteen people at my particular caucus precinct.  The way a caucus works is that for the first half hour, we elect delegates to go to the state democratic convention.  Chances are pretty good that I would end up one of the delegates, and I really truely don't want to be.  The next two-and-a-half hours are spent debating and deciding which candidate you will put your vote in for.  If your candidate doesn't secure 15% of the people's support, then you are forced to choose between those who did secure 15% of the support.  There can be much yelling, and much pressure to go with what everyone else is doing so you don't have to be the focus of a hold-out.  The end result cannot be that you decided you didn't like any of the options that were left open.  Also during one of these portions of the process, you sit and decide whether or not you back certain legislation or certain things that would be on the ballot in November.  Things here can stem from street improvement to garbage fees.  What I'm saying here is that I'm not sure I want to spend 3 hours locked in a small room with a bunch of die-hard Democrats.  Yes, I am a Democrat, but I find the thought of being stuck in that room right up there with a three hour lecture on the environmental effects of water buffalo farts.  Add on top of that the fact that this goddamned tailbone of mine hasn't yet stopped with the surges of pain when seated on hard chairs (which is what will be in that room), and I'm really considering staying home.  Why can't I just phone in my vote?  Sit me in the John Edwards group, and if that doesn't get 15%, then I'll move over to John Kerry.  And if that's not an option, then I guess Gephardt is the next choice.  If all I'm left with is Howard Dean, I'd rather just abstain, please.  Before I ever heard the man say anything, I knew I didn't like him.  Hearing him speak has further driven home my initial reaction.  I've said this before, but the man is Bush with a faster tongue and more brains to talk people into doing stupid shit.  In my mind, that's not the kind of person that I want anywhere near the election, let alone the potential person we're sending up to go against Bush.  One thing I will say about all this caucus mess, though.  Come Tuesday morning, we'll be back to being a second-thought state, and we won't have to listen to another political ad until late spring/summer.  And that?  Will make me so very happy.  I'm just sick of the whole thing.  Though I am glad to hear the polls as of late having Dean and Gephardt slipping.  The two started slinging shit at eachother a few months back, and it's finally caught up to them.  I said all along that the way to win this thing wasn't to bash the other democrats, but rather to go after Bush.  Edwards and Kerry have been doing that all along, and now it's paying off.  When will those silly fools listen to me?  Never, because I'm just a peon, but seriously, it was really simple common sense.  You think your party is going to beat the other party after people within your party spent three months tearing eachother apart?  Duh.  So the Carolina Panthers and the New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl, huh.  I think I speak for a good chunk of the country when I say....who cares.  If it had been Indy and Philly, that'd be a different story, but Carolina cannot surge any excitement in people.  Recent expansion team?  No history?  Leads to big doses of nobody cares.  Iowa v Iowa State basketball game on Wednesday.  My parents got tickets for Christmas from my brother and sister-in-law.  No, I wasn't jealous at all.  It should be a good game.  Notice I said should.  Iowa has been inconsistant at best.  Iowa State hasn't played anybody worth much of anything.  Personally, I think Iowa State should have to play Northern Iowa one more time (and this time they'd have some advanced warning that Jackson Vroman actually wasn't in jail and would actually be on the court).  The way UNI is playing right now, I'm not sure ISU would win.  I'd actually wager that ISU would lose.  And I've said for a long time that UNI basketball sucks.  But, the tides may have turned.  A win over two ranked teams in the Dome already this season?  That's probably enough to officially declare the season one of the best in the last 20 years.  Sad, isn't it.

      Just fucking incredible.  How have I not yet figured out how to maliciously push my own agenda on people and make them go along with me without even a second goddamned look?  Once I master that, I think I can rule the world.  Because right now, I'm supposed to be a pawn in someone else's game and quite frankly, this shit stinks.  I'm done playing--the endgame is coming sooner than anyone else expected, because my patience doesn't happen to last that long.  No, president of the school board, I will not be "teaching" a unit in  Physical Education  on how to play 500.  Just because the word "play" is in front of it, doesn't make it a physical activity.  Just because your grandson doesn't like getting sweaty doesn't mean I'm going to cater to him.  Yes, I'm aware that the last person with my job did, but I'm afraid she left to go have a baby (with no intention of coming back), and that doesn't mean you hired yourself a new pawn.  And no, I don't care that this is what the other classes are doing, because this one is not going to do it.  I will not be a piece on a chess board (oh, and by the way, I won't be teaching that, either).  Next unit in my classes: cross country skiing.  You don't like it, well, too bad.  We've got the skis in storage.  We've got the snow.  We've got the actual professional-type instructor lined up (for free).  And  most  of my students are really damned excited about it.  Even the non-active ones.  Oh, and just to spite your sorry butt, I'll put bowling on my list of units before I'll ever consider playing cards worthy of being tought in school.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure the prez knew quite what to do when I gave a big hell no to his request.  In fact, some of the other school board members were a little shocked (I guess no one ever flat out turns his requests down).  Listen, fool, I know you and I know what you're all about.  I also know that next year is re-election year for you, so unless you feel like giving up your little reign of terror on an already-floundering school-sharing agreement, I suggest you not push it.  And most certainly, not push me.  You won't like me when I push back.  Oh, and you won't like it at all when you find out that more than one of those board members who rarely, if ever, have your back, are (confirmed to be) firmly in my corner.  Call it a conspiracy if you will, but your days of pushing innocent people around are over.  OVER!  It starts with me, it ends with the rest of the school board.  There's already a bit of a plan in place.  There was when the job was dropped in my lap.  I came in here knowing that this is the one job in my life that I  could  actually be fired from.  I also came in here knowing that more than half of the school board wouldn't let that happen, just because they want your screw-ball butt out of there.  37 years is 35 years too many for you to have been in that position.  The fact that half of your precinct is too afraid to run against you, and the other half has too much invested in your company to rock the boat is no longer an issue.  We want you out.  They want you out.  And the students want you out.  And we'd like it done sooner than later.  This time, the students are going to get a say in the matter.  You taking away their right to have any sort of fun, and also taking away the teachers' right to teach things that actually matter (reminder: cards doesn't make the list), kind of has you on the bad side of both the faculty and students.  Your son no longer teaches here.  Your daughter no longer lives here.  Your brother is no longer living.  Looks like nobody's got your back.  Happy trails, asshole.  I'd like a photograph when you finally figure all of this out.  The look on your face may just be priceless.  There is one single reason that I came back here.  Just one.  It wasn't the job (though I do like the prospect of coaching).  It wasn't the pay (I scoff at the lowball offer that I took).  It was the fact that there's some pretty serious shit going down in the school where my cousin (who is like a little sister to me) is often the target of bullies, and quite frankly, is often terrified to even go to school.  High school is a bitch without all that, but add that all onto it, and she's considered dropping out, and her parents (and the rest of the family) has been concerned that she may harm herself.  The school board president has sloughed this all off as "oh, kids will be kids."  No, that's not the right way to handle things, and this is going to be rectified if I have to do it myself.  It comes down to the fact that the lead bully is his grandson.  I've seen him in action, and the kid has never had anyone ever tell him "no."  You could see on his face he wanted to come at me when I told him he couldn't be excused from class the other day (his excuse was just this: "Well, I want to and Mrs. [last teacher] always let me").  He didn't take too kindly to me making him stop swearing at the other students when they were playing simple man-on-man defense during a game of basketball.  And really didn't like it when I personally escorted him to the principal's office and put his butt in detention for defying a teacher.    Nobody gets away with messing with my family.  I've had my moments of not loving what they're all about (more than moments--more like years), but that doesn't mean I'm not going to protect them when they need protecting.  I will not let this continue and I will not let these people who turn their heads to continue serving this community's children.  It's no wonder kids are so out-of-sorts these days, they don't have anyone showing them what is right and what is wrong.  Parents deny their children have problems.  Authority figures deny that anything is ever wrong, because they're too lazy to deal with it.  Christ, this may be a utopiaville, but shit is screwed up around here.  It was never this bad when I was in school here.  There was some sense in everyone that at least let people know right from wrong.  Substance abuse may have been here, but it wasn't dipping into the middle and high school.  And now there are gangs.  Yeah, I said gangs.  Gangs that will pluck you right off the street, terrorize you for a few hours, put you in your trunk and then leave you to freeze to death in the cold.  There have been three instances of that since I moved back, and it's only been a few weeks.  What happened to my sleepy little hometown?  Nothing ever happened here.  Meth lab busts weren't a weekly occurence.  Kidnapping was something that happened somewhere else.  I never intended to have to do this, but after cross country skiing, I think self-defense is going to have to be the next unit.  The "good" kids are afraid to leave their houses by themselves.  If I wasn't so damned stubborn and confident that I could take care of myself, I'd probably be smart enough to not leave the house at night as well.  You'd think living miles and miles out of town on a little family farm would make it safer to go out when the sun goes down, but it doesn't.  One of these kidnappings happened out in the middle of nowhere, where the woman was just walking down her driveway to get the mail.  Hell, when I lived here before, even the word divorce was foreign to us.  Nobody's parents were separated or divorced.  Like I've said, it used to be a little utopiaville.  Everything was always the way it always was.  If you've ever seen the movie, "Pleasantville,"  it was very similar to that.  Of course, we were all in color and it wasn't 1952, but aside from that, it was quite similar.  Nothing ever changed.  The same families that lived here in 1928, still lived here and ran the same businesses.  Most of those businesses are now gone (since I left for college), and most of those families are still sparsely here, but there are new crops of people I've never met, and who don't know me (this is both a blessing and a curse), and who, for the most part, don't speak english.  I know that last one isn't shocking to most people from a city, but it just wasn't something that you had around here.  They taught spanish in school, you didn't learn it when trying to figure out what the clerk at the grocery store was saying to you.  I mean, that part is progress, but it's change that nobody here is used to.  My poor grandmother has had to stop using racial slurs, and you know, whatever will she do about that?  Like I said, it's progress, but some of the things that have changed have dirtied this little town.  When we were in high school (a different high school in a different town--different sharing agreement), our little town was known as the "good" town.  People here never got in trouble.  The worst you could do here was speed (and I don't mean the drug).  None of us ever even contemplated anything worse than that.  At least not in our town.  We would go elsewhere to find trouble, but never ever in our town.  Too many people talk.  And too many of them talk to our parents.  And the four of us that graduated from my high school from my town all knew that there was only one thing to do to get us out of here.  We had to keep our nose clean and study our asses off.  Two of us managed to do that, the other two didn't, and never left.  Yeah, I came back, but like I said, I came back with a purpose in mind.  Okay, I'm aware that not a lot of this entire entry was coherent, but I'm pissed off.  And this is how I sound when I'm pissed off.  If I feel like it (and have time), I'll go back and fix things when I get home.  Until then, have a better day than me, okay?

      And for once, I actually mean it.  Shocking, I know.  To anyone still sending crap to my Earthlink mail and then bitching at me on my voicemail that I never email you back, get a clue.  You have my new email address.  Use it.  It's not my fault in any way, shape or form that you're dumb.  To anyone looking for a beautiful song to make you cry in the middle of doing and thinking about absolutely nothing, I would point you in the direction of "My Immortal" by Evanesence (I'm tired and may have slaughtered that name).  Yes, I don't like the band.  I've mentioned it on numerous occasions.  But this song is fabulously sad.  And if you know me, you know I can never resist a sad song as long as it's fabulously sad.  Mediochrity in the sad song department breeds contempt from me.  You can't half-ass sadness in music.  It makes you look like a chump.  Shit.  I need to sleep.  Or maybe I need to watch this episode of VH1's "Driven" about Dave Matthews.  I'll decide once I'm tucked under my flannel comforter and on top of my feather bed (some days it pays to dig in the boxes in the attic--you find all sorts of goodies up there that no one has ever used).  Yeah, I guess it wasn't so short.  Oops.

      Sleep.  That's what I should be doing right now.  But, uh, obviously I'm not.  Why is that?  No really, why am I not sleeping?  I don't know.  Any input would be accepted with open arms (unless it's dumb, and then I'll laugh at you).  Okay, brainfart of the weekend.  "Oh, hey, Mom, what do you say I help you clean the storage room in the basement so I can move those huge boxes out of the middle of the living room."  Big mistake.  BIG.    This task may never end.  There's crap in there from before this house burned down.  Just a little history lesson for you.  My aunt and uncle used to live here.  They moved in here after it had been rebuilt after a fire (where a woman died--a fact that I was not aware of until a few years ago, but quite frankly explains a few of my childhood nightmares).  Several years later, they moved to a farm out in the middle of nowhere (which is really everything within 45 minutes of here) and a year or two later, my parents moved in here.  Anyway, in the fire, a lot of stuff was left behind that belonged to the woman who died in the fire.  She had no family, so this stuff was all just cleaned and put back in the house (things like old coffee cans filled with nails and those kinds of things that don't burn).  Yeah, this whole home transaction from burned down to my aunt and uncle living in the house was about five or six years before I was even born.  That's how old some of the shit in there is.  Oh, and just to give you a visual, all of the beams in the ceiling of the basement are the same as those in the house that burned down.  They weren't replaced.  They're charred and if you touch them, they smell like burning wood.  At some point, I fully expect the house to collapse in on itself.  Anyway, from about 8am until mom stopped to make dad dinner at 5:30, we were in there moving shit around.  She refuses to throw anything out.  Now, a few weeks ago, I mentioned that dad was the packrat.  I was wrong.  They both are.  Jeez!  There is an entire 5-shelf unit with doors with just old jars in it.  Empty and not used for years.  And not old canning jars.  Just old jars that used to contain something they bought in the store.  Jelly jars, pickle jars, peanut butter jars.  Just miles and miles of jars.  No dice on trying to get those thrown out.  Because we "might" need them someday.  Probably 476 cans of old paint down there.  Right next to the furnace.  I bet that's still good.  Except that there are colors in there for things mother claims she painted, but which I've never seen.  Boxes upon boxes of old wallpaper.  Because she might want to touch up the paper that has been on the walls for close to 10 years in some parts of the house.  Okay, first of all, no.  And second of all, wallpaper is of the devil.  I hate wallpaper.  I hate wallpaper paste.  I hate the smell of it, and I refuse to have it anywhere near me.  If this shit falls off the wall, we're painting the shit.  Christ, even she hates the wallpaper in the living room.  I hated it as soon as she rolled it out on the table.  I've papered far more walls in my lifetime than any one human being should be forced to do, and I will not do it anymore.  Just no.  No more wallpaper.  I refuse.  When she turned her back, most of it went in the trash.  Don't tell her.  I suspect we'll be at this basement storage room cleaning business until the end of January or one of us drops dead or lights a match in there.  At this particular moment, I'm not sure which will come first.

      Sounds like the faculty lounge not only just got computer hookups, but also recently got cable.  The folks around this place are rediculously excited because they can watch soap operas all day.  Fun for about an hour, and then you must find something else to do.  Don't tell the English teacher that, because she may actually bite your head off.  I saw her do this to someone yesterday.  Yeah, so I promised an update on Wednesday, but the whole thing about the parents being gone for meetings was just a mistake on their part--as in, they didn't actually have meetings, but merely misread their stupid calendar.  Chances are that the next update from home might be extraordinarily late at night, or on the 21st or 22nd of the month because I  know  they'll be out of town one of those two nights.  Anyway, back to work stories.  There aren't many, because at the present time, my job is about as boring as can be.  Study Hall is excruciatingly uneventful (I'm also in the process of waiting for the students to get in here and sit down for an hour and a half of bored time).  Seriously, when we were in high school, we at least made study hall interesting.  We'd come up with elaborate plans to figure out how the hell to get out of the building without the study hall teacher noticing we were gone for an hour.  I was good at it.  A trustworthy face helps this effort.  Shit, all these students would have to do is put forth a good effort and I'd let them run around.  I could care less.  This particular study hall this afternoon is 8 seniors who have already got all the credits to graduate, not to mention they've been taking remote courses from a college nearby, so really, all they do in study hall is....study.  What's wrong with them?  Maybe they're just feeling me out for a while to see how I work (the stone-face tends to keep the kids on their toes, which I guess isn't a terrible thing) and how far I'll let them go before I reel them back in.  The fact that I nearly napped their first day in my presence should be an indication for them, but my guess is that the last person in my position was a bit more uptight than I am.  I've never met her, so maybe she was.  I have yet to be included on the gossip circuit from the faculty lounge, so I don't know much of anything about anyone around here at the moment.  As for the PE portion of my schedule, the designated unit we're on right now (as determined by the head fitness guy--he has a title.  He shouldn't) is basketball.  Three of the 15 kids in one of my sections are actually coordinated enough to dribble the ball.  The other section is mostly athletes (which makes me exceptionally happy--less teaching, more doing) so it's easier to just jump right into things.  I had the athletes this morning (they have the schedule set up this way for some reason--if they were smart, they'd put the athletes in the late class, because then they don't have to worry about changing before practice, and they also don't have to worry about missing tests for days that they have to leave early).  There's 9 kids in that class, so they need a spare to fill out a 5-on-5 game, so I get to play.  Which is great.  Gives me something to do.  The other section doesn't allow for much more than me pointing to give them an idea of how to do things, so there is less participation on my part.  Hopefully once track season gets started I'll be more excited about work, but a week into it, I'm getting bored already.  At least once practices start, I can spend the downtime (and there's a shitload of downtime) to figure out drills for each person on the team.  I'm already aware of a shining spot on the team (it's a fairly new program for the school, so the development has been slow), but I also was made aware that this girl's mother is the coach of everything (including the head coach of the track team), so I'll have to watch myself to not step on toes.  This coach woman doesn't teach at the school, and I'm not even certain she's aware that I was hired.  I've encountered this woman in the past.  She was an assistant volleyball coach when I was in middle school.  She didn't like me then, and I can't imagine her thoughts have changed all that much.  I guess we'll see.  I should go make sure everyone is present and accounted for (they are, I can see they're all here).  Maybe I'll run to the library and find something to read.

      Whoever it was that thought moving home was a good idea was clearly having a delusional moment.  So much to bitch about and so little time to do so.  I finally hear snoring from the parental bedroom, meaning no one will be wandering in here in the next three and a half minutes, giving me just enough time to let people know that I did make it here alive.  I can't guarantee I'll leave that way.  I'll have to wait until Wednesday to give all the juicy (read: fucking annoying) details, because on Wednesday evening, both mom and dad have meetings so I'll have the place to myself for a couple hours.  I would imagine there will be a flurry of phone calls, IMs, emails, and postings on here at that time, so keep a look out for that.  As for the job, so far, so good.  The first day started with a 2 hour late start on account of a busted water mane.  Day two is going to start 2 hours late on account of the fucking miserable windchills (how does 50 below strike your fancy?  Yeah, mine isn't struck either).  Guess who isn't doing her morning run tomorrow.  Go on, guess.  That's right.  Even I have enough sense to stay the hell out of that kind of frigidity.  Hey, Iowa won their bowl game.  Perhaps the biggest shock of the bowl season.  At least it certainly was to Ron Zook.  You bet your ass you got out-coached, punk.  Remember that next time your guys are still talking smack when they're down 20 points.  Y'all didn't stand a snowball's chance in Miami of winning that game as soon as you underestimated the coaching staff.  Oh, and saying that PK Nate Kaeding was a really great wide receiver helped things along quite well, don't you think?  Bonehead.  Okay, now I need to go to bed so I can be well rested for another day of dodging mom (she's making me crazier than I already was) and shortened work schedules.  God I can't wait until track season starts.

      I'm back at the little internet cafe.  I kind of like this little place.  It's cute and quiet and just, well, pacific-northwesternish.  Does that make any sense?  Does it matter?  Well, Mr H  finally  got on a plane.  He was on the 9:30am flight out of London to Atlanta on Delta.  I've never flown Delta, but he was utterly unimpressed.  Well, I take that back, he was impressed with the fact that his flight arrived an hour and a half before it was scheduled to, and still managed to depart twenty minutes late.  He's been in Atlanta since a bit before 2:00pm (ET).  He's supposed to get on the flight from Atlanta at about 7:30 (ET) and get here around 10 tonight, but he's trying (without much success so far) to get on an earlier flight.  Why does air travel have to be so rediculous?  But, of course, it could be worse.  He was talking to a guy at Heathrow (he ended up flying out of Gatwick) in London who was trying to get home to Charlotte for his little girl's first birthday.  He kept getting on standby on flights out of Heathrow and being just a few people away from getting on the plane.  I guess this happened about five times to both he and Mr H before Mr H finally decided to check other airports (I'd never heard of Gatwick--hell, I didn't even realize there was more than one airport in London) and other carriers (he has more frequent flier miles with United and American, so he tries to use them all the time).  Mr H said that when he left Heathrow (after securing a guaranteed seat on a  much  cheaper flight), the other guy was on standby with three more flights.  Hopefully the other guy will give up the standby route if he's rejected from all three of these flights and try the surrounding airports.    Remind me if I'm ever going to or through London to go through Gatwick instead of Heathrow, because after looking around online for the past few minutes, flights to and from Gatwick appear to be much cheaper.  And looking at schedules, it appears they're on time a lot more often than those in and out of Heathrow.  Unfortunately it doesn't appear that United flies out of there, but everything else appears to.  Mr H had to retool his return trip so that he flies into Gatwick (roundtrip ticket).  Of course, then he has to get himself over to Heathrow to get back to Rome.  If he hadn't had that stupid problem in London (okay, it wasn't stupid, but you get what I'm saying), and had he known about Gatwick before, he wouldn't have to still use the rest of the roundtrip ticket from Heathrow to Rome.  A one-way from Gatwick to Rome will cost about the same as a roundtrip to Portland.  Which, to me, sounds odd.  One flight shouldn't cost more than two that cover more than 6 times (each way) the distance.  It just shouldn't.  Can you tell I've had too much time to look into all of this?  Yeah, I have.  It's making me crazy.  As if I had far to go.

      Well, some of you won't be checking here for a week or so, so here's an early surprise, I guess.  I'm in a cafe/bookstore in Portland, Oregon, waiting very impatiently for a message letting me know someone's alternate travel plans.    You see, I'm supposed to be meeting Mr H here.  I didn't find out that his flight out of London was delayed until I checked my voicemail three hours after landing here in Portland.  You know how the cute little envelope is supposed to pop up on the screen of your phone when you have mail?  Yeah, mine is supposed to do that as soon as the message arrives.  It apparently thought no big deal of waiting until 8 hours  after  the message was left to let me know it was there.  Not that it would have made a lot of difference, because my flight would have still left on time and I would still be sitting here waiting, but I wouldn't have spent three extra hours in the airport.  I'd have gone and done something.  I have no idea what, but surely I would have found something.  I did manage to pick up the rental car (in his name) so I could at least get to the hotel and drop my stuff off.  And in the process, I saw this little cafe (I wish I could remember how to put the accent on the 'e', but I just can't remember right now).  I tied on my running shoes as soon as I got checked in and got a good "shake the plane-stink off 'ya" run in on the way here.  Anyway, Mr H's flights were messed up because I guess it was foggy in London.  He's trying to get booked on the next flight to the states at the moment, and not having a great deal of luck in doing so.  If he manages to get on one of those flights, he'll figure out how to get to Portland from wherever the chosen state-side destination may be.  That's, again,  if  he gets on one of those flights.  From the sounds of things, it's not all that likely.  If he doesn't get here before Monday morning, the entire weeks plans will be switched or chucked.  He's supposed to be meeting with an orthopaedic surgeon to repair his broken hand, and if he likes the guy, he plans to have the surgery on Tuesday morning.  If he doesn't have the surgery this week?  He won't have it until he moves back to the states the first week in May.  So his arrival by Monday morning is fairly important.  I'll keep you all updated.  And someone call me if you can think of anything interesting to do by myself in Portland.

      Well, I have the day off today, and for once it has nothing to do with cruddy weather.  In fact, the way it sounds, it's downright balmy outside today.  BUT, I'm sick.  I have a cold.  Only this cold has taken me on with no warning whatsoever, and has invaded my inner ears, my sinuses, my throat, my nose, my eyes, and every last muscle.  I sent mom out 5 hours ago to bring me back my termination remedy of DayQuil and NyQuil, but I haven't seen nor heard from her since.  My eyes are rediculously watery, my nose will not stop running, and in fact, this is the first I've been out of bed all day.  This week has been nothing short of full.  Insanely full.  Between crappy roads on a return road trip to helping my very smart cousin study for a geometry test that she has to do well on (I haven't had geometry in nearly 10 years--I remember nothing), I'm exhausted.  I'm chalking that up to the cold.  And now, I'm off to refill the vaporizer, rub on the vapo-rub, grab another wad of tissues and nestle myself back into bed.  Hopefully sometime this millenium my mom will return with drugs.

      For those of you who aren't planning on calling me at 5:45pmCT, skip this message.  I'm about 10 minutes removed from leaving for the weekend, and just thought I'd leave a little note to those I couldn't get ahold of (read: person with disfunctional voicemail and even more disfunctional email--hey, I told you you'd need a virus protector).  I'll be in Ames/Des Moines for the weekend, so if you need to get ahold of me (read: when you call in 2 1/2 hours), I'll probably be inside at an indoor track meet where cell phones never work.  But, leave me a voicemail (instructions: press 1, wait for the instructions to stop, press 3 and then start talking--there is no beep) so I know when to call you back.  If any of that doesn't work, just call Dana and she'll give you instructions.  But don't call her between 6 and 8.  She'll be sleeping.  Okay, now if you're not the person this message was intended for, you officially fail at following directions.  I'll deal with you later.

      Looks like the  urlLink US Attourney's office wised up  and nixed the subpoenas on the people who attended a protest rally back in November.  The part of the story that strikes me as quite possibly the funniest thing I've heard all week, is that they were going after members of the National Lawyer's Guild.  And they thought nobody would raise a fuss?  Have they ever met lawyers?  Especially with the gaggle of civil liberty lawyers that annually come out of Drake University's law school?  How dumb was that?!  At least they wised up.  Gotta give them a tiny bit of credit on that one.  But just a tiny bit.

       urlLink War protesters were served with subpoenas by the US Attourney's office .  Who thinks that's a good idea?  No?  You don't?  Yeah, me either.  No, I don't agree with the protesters, nor do I think 20-person protests of a war does much to change the minds of the administration that sent kids to war for reasons that turned out to be blatant lies.  Weapons of mass destruction, my ass!  Read back to my entries in March of last year, when this whole damn thing started and you'll find me defending the reasons we went in to Iraq.  I'm afraid to say I was wrong, but I was (and as it appears most of the government was) going along with the president who claimed there was intelligence that supported his claims.  Turns out he was lying, or the CIA was lying.  I'm inclined to believe the CIA knew what was up and GW chose to ignore the facts.  He's really good at that.  Yeah, sure, GW, the economy is improving.  Sure, I believe you did that without creating any new jobs and giving the rich folks tax breaks while overtaxing the middle and lower classes.  Yep, I really buy that.  Of course, I've been known to see pigs flying out of my ass, too, so take that into consideration when believing anything I have to say on this particular administrations achievements.  Or lack thereof.  But my point?  Is it a good idea to start a grand jury investigation into peaceful protestors?  It's not.  This shit ranks right up there with this Patriot Act that has every word out of my virtual mouth monitored, analyzed and flopped into the category of "good egg" and "bad egg" like the goddamned golden geese in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  No, governmental watchdogs, I don't think you checking into what I'm up to is a good process in which to find possible terrorists.  No, governmental big brother, I don't buy that anyone thinks you can find a terrorist by checking into what people are checking out of the library.  Oh, and do you know  why  I don't think these methods work?  Because I'm by no means the smartest person in the world, but if I were a terrorist and knew you're watching for those things, I just simply wouldn't do those things.  If you're going to monitor us, fine, go right ahead.  You'd save yourself a lot more trouble if you'd stop publicising all the security measures you take (okay, not all, I know as well as the next guy that there are things going on that we don't know about).  And in the meantime, let's see if we can't get a handle on airport security at the very least.  Or maybe, I don't know, round up all the people in this country illegally and send their collective asses home.  Yeah, the INS is busy, I get it, but since GW said the economy is doing so well, I think he should shovel some money into the INS so they can get some more workers to get all the people here illegally, out.  Oh, and while we're on the subject, GW thinks giving undocumented foreign workers cheap jobs in the US somehow makes that better than letting them have the same cheap jobs in their home countries?  Let me get this straight.  He thinks that if we pay undocumented (read: illegal) workers to work in the US for cheap that it will improve our economy and clear up the load on the INS?  Shit, just get rid of the INS all together and open the goddamned borders, while you're at it.  It seems like 50% or more of the manual labor force in the state of Iowa is undocumented workers.  Nevermind that those workers are taking the jobs that should go to tax-paying Americans who have a right to live and work here.  The illegal folks will work for damn near free.  And nevermind that the unemployment rate in the state is at about a 50 year high.  George W. Bush and the rest of this administration have done everything in their power to set us back 20-30 years.  Thank you, you overgrown monkey.  I'll leave you with a little food for thought.  Is anyone else starting to wonder whether the attacks on 9/11/01 would have happened if GW wasn't the president?  This thought came to mind while reading an article on the Bush family agenda that was in  Rolling Stone  a month or so ago.  Isn't it even the slightest bit possible that Osama figured GW was going to be rolling the tanks in that general area anyway to get back at Saddam for trying to kill his father, so why not throw the first punch?  Am I the only person who has thought this?  I can't be the only one who has wondered this.  And quite frankly, who the hell knows, maybe GW and his monkey staff were provoking al Qaida.  At this late point in the Texas fry-daddy's (for those of you out of the loop, read up on GW's execution streak while serving as the governor of Texas) administration, I wouldn't be even the slightest bit surprised.

      This hottie alert brought to you by the UMC.  Yes, folks, that stands for the United Methodist Church.  I went to church this morning.  I've gone every morning since I've been here, because not going only unleashes the wrath much worse than any this God person can hand out.  It unleashes endless hours of lecturing at the hands of my grandmother, and now you'd pile on top of that, every old person in town, along with everyone where I teach.  In this town, if you don't go to church, you're considered a leper.  But, I digress.  I said hottie alert, damnit, and I'm not even kidding this time (I'm actually putting it in writing--that's enough proof right there--but even this hottie has his flaws).  I'm sitting in church this morning, minding my own business (aka, trying desperately to get comfortable, but not too comfortable as to fall asleep--the pews are uncomfortable for folks over 5'4"--not enough leg room to cross and/or uncross the legs, and no place to go with the feet except straight under the pew), and this drop dead gorgeous creature strolls in and parks himself in the pew in front of me.  Clearly it was his first venture into this particular church, because no one knew who he was judging by the not-so-quiet whispering going on from the back to the front of the small church (old people's perception of a quiet whisper is a little off).  Another dead giveaway was his confusion as to what to do with his well-over-six-foot frame in this no-one-over-five-foot-four pew.  He was at enough of an angle to me that he saw me out of the corner of his eye and noticed the same sort of issue, to which he asked quietly for some pointers.  Now, I'm very rarely speechless, and even more rarely flustered by a good looking man, but this one was just so perfectly....perfect, I nearly had to roll my tongue back up into my mouth before I could answer.  Instead I answered with a demonstration (I'd go into it, but this story is already becoming too long for Mr. H's taste--I'm sure I'll get a call bright and early about it).  Anyway, this man's name is Jason, and he's a model from West Virginia, in town to visit his grandparents for a week or so.  Those of you who know this place can imagine my shock that someone from this town could have genetically produced such a fine specimine of a male.  He, being in an industry where looks are everything, asked me where to find a good gym around here.  Me, being an insider around these parts, scoffed and said there are no good gyms around here, but I'd be willing to supervise the high school weight room if he needed to work out on whatever he could find in there.  He, apparently being used to getting whatever he wants whenever he wants, took me up on the offer, but requested a workout a half hour from that exact moment.  Of course, then I had to tell the silly model that the weight room is locked up tight on the weekends.  He, of course, reminded me that as a faculty member, I have a key.  Hey, how 'bout that, he was right, I do have a key.  And I, being a slight bit scatterbrained, had yet to take advantage of that, so I caved and went to let the pretty guy work out and work out a bit myself.  Sunday workouts?  This is the first in many months.   [Mr. H will love this portion of the story]  Anyway, while he was working out, I realized he was a lot more interested in watching me work out than he was in actually working out himself.  And, of course, there was the inevitable attempt at a come-on, to which I knocked down.  And then, the creme-de-la-creme, he grabbed my ass on the way to the car.  Those of you that have seen this happen to me, also have seen what happens to anyone who thinks they can cop a little feel without any repercussions.  Let's just say he found himself face-down in a snow drift with his arm twisted up behind his head and a knee into his back.  From then through the ride back to his dear old grandparents' house (who I know and have nothing but respect for), he was a completely different person.  I get the impression that he's not used to having a woman turn him down, let alone knock him down and threaten to break his arm if he didn't quit acting like such a douche-bag.  He appologized probably 17 times in the 15 minute ride.  I think he thought I would press charges or something, I don't know, but the turn-around was stunning.  So, stunning, in fact, that I said if he behaves himself, he's welcome to use the weight room before, at lunch, or after school this week if he let me know he was coming in advance so I could make sure it was open and supervised.  Chances are good, it won't be tomorrow.  Fucking winter weather.  We're already 2 hours late because it's supposed to snow tonight and blow like a banshee in the morning.  Do you know how long I actually worked last week?  Not very damn long.  This weather gets shittier and shittier the further into February we get.  If it's not snowing a half of a foot, it's so far below zero that the school buses won't start or the wind chill is farther than 35 below, so by school mandate, we have to have a late start.  My morning class seems to start at like noon lately. Speaking of morning, I should go to bed.  I'm expecting a phone call no later than 6am.

      Okay, so here's another survey sent to me by my many (okay, three) fans.  This time I jumped right on top of it.  Aren't you proud.  1. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? If you don't know it, you don't get it here.  2. WHAT COLOR PANTS ARE YOU WEARING? Gray velour sweatpants.  Despite some people's loathing of them, they're really damned comfortable.  3. WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW? SportsCenter  4. EVER BEEN SO IN LOVE IT MADE YOU CRY? Yes.  And the total of times this has happened to me is currently at 5, but two guys did it to me twice.  5. WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU ATE? Broccoli cheese soup.  With crackers.  6. IF YOU WERE A CRAYON WHAT COLOR WOULD YOU BE? I'd be white.  Because no one ever picks white.  I feel sorry for white.  7. LAST PERSON YOU TALKED TO ON THE PHONE? My grandmother.  She called to tell me that she was going to town.  Because for some reason she thinks I needed to know.  8. THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE OPPOSITE SEX? Their face.  Then their build.  I like a guy with muscles.  9. DO YOU LIKE THE PERSON WHO SENT YOU THIS? Yeah.  And if I didn't, I surely wouldn't tell them here.  10. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? Well, 45 minutes in, and so far, so good.    11. FAVORITE DRINK? Water.  How original.  12. FAVORITE ALCOHOLIC DRINK? Whatever somebody else is buying.  But if I have to pay, I'd say Vanilla Rum and Coke.  13. FAVORITE SPORTS? Track, volleyball, basketball (college), football, golf, etc.  You name it, I probably don't hate it.  14. HAIR COLOR? Blonde, but I need a little help because my true color is starting to show.  15. SUMMER OR WINTER? Summer.  I love it when it's hot.  Even if I bitch about it.  16. HUGS OR KISSES? Kisses.  Because a hug can come from anyone, any time.    17. RELATIONSHIPS OR ONE NIGHT STANDS? Relationships, hands down.  18. CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA? Chocolate rules.  But, uh, I choose both.  Because I can.  And I'd like to see anybody try to stop me.   19. LIVING ARRANGEMENTS? 3 br house in the smallest goddamned town in Iowa.  Oh, and my parents live here, too.  Now what'd I do with that gun?  20. WHAT BOOKS ARE YOU READING? I was reading a psychotic thriller murder mystery, but at one point it caused me to have a dream that I was running through the streets of Manhattan from a crazed terrorist who knew that I knew where he lived, so I stopped reading that one.  I just uncovered my mom's stash of trashy romance novels, so I suspect that'll be next on my list of items to read.  21. WHAT'S ON YOUR MOUSE PAD? CC&I Inc.  I applied for a job with them while in college.  They turned me down.  But they gave me this mouse pad.  How nice of them.  22. WHAT DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT? Watched The Matrix on TNT.  Somehow listening to Neo say "Jeepers creepers" 14 times instead of whatever he was intended to say at that particular moment kind of takes the fun out of the movie.  And if that doesn't do it, the ads for Tampax will.    23. FAVORITE SMELLS? Fresh brewed coffee and homemade bread.  Smelling them at once might actually kill you because they smell so good.  24. CAN YOU TOUCH YOUR NOSE WITH YOUR TONGUE? No.  I think that if you can touch your nose with your tongue, there are many more important things you should be doing with your time.  And I can think of three.  25. WHAT INSPIRES YOU? Fear of failure.  26. BUTTERED, PLAIN, OR SALTED POPCORN? I spend more time picking hulls out of my teeth than I ever spend eating it.  I'm just not really a fan of popcorn, unless it's all I have.  27. FAVORITE CAR? I'm pretty fond of my 2002 Ford Escape.  But I'm not really that picky.  But I'd still never pick a Saturn.  28. FAVORITE FLOWER? Lilies.

       ITEM ONE:  First and foremost, happy birthday to Jamie, because I will, inevitably, forget to call you and tell you on Wednesday.  I always do.  But then, you forget my birthday every year, too, so it's just tradition at this point, isn't it.   ITEM TWO:  The track season is off and running (see that...a pun.  Lame, but no less a pun.)  We even had a meet already.  Okay, it was a half-ass indoor meet at the dome (which, by the way, remind me to talk to the AD so he never schedules that three hour trip with a bus-full of 14-18 year olds ever again), and we had only had about 6 days of practice.  Our next meet isn't until the second week of April, so we have a little hiatus, which is needed.  We have a lot of girls who are out for track just to have something to do in the fall.  Some of them aren't too bad.  Some of them clearly would rather be eating bon bons in front of the television.  And some of them have a lot of talent, but have no clue what to do with it and no encouragement from anyone to even realize the talent.  Those are the ones that I'm working most intensely with this early-season.  Because those are the ones that need the most help, but will also be the ones to benefit the most from learning that they are good at something.  I have to admit that I'm working them harder than they probably have ever been worked in their lives, and some are on the verge of quitting, but those are the ones that don't really want to be there anyway, so if they go, I'm okay with it.  The head coach might not be, but that's the difference between the two of us.  Speaking of the head coach, as I mentioned previously, she is the mother of one of the athletes.  This girl is crazy talented, and her mother knows it.  And her mother gives her breaks and lets her do whatever she wants to do during practice, which has included standing around telling others how to do things, standing around timing every one else, and telling me that I don't deserve this job because I'm a bitch.  You all know how well that went over, don't you?  She's dreading next week, when dear old mom won't be there.  Because she's running her ass off, and I'm running with her to make damn sure she does it.  That's another difference between the head coach and I.  I can run.  I was/am a runner.  She never has been and never will be a runner.  She doesn't know jack about the sport, let alone how to train a distance runner.  Not to mention that she has no clue how to put the girls on a weight lifting program that will not bulk them up (have you ever seen a distance runner that could also play linebacker?  Me either).    I'm already okay with the fact that, at the most, we will have no more than 2 state qualifiers this year.  Because I have a lot of damage to undo to what the non-qualified head coach has already done in the past 5 seasons.  We've got to basically change the body composition of some of these girls, and that's not at all easy.  At least I've got the trust of most of them (which was really quite easy to come by--all I had to do was run with them so they understood that I didn't just read this shit out of a book and instead apply it in my own life).  The sprinters are okay with me because someone (I don't know who, but I'm guessing it was my cousin) filled them in on my sprinting resume.  All it really takes to make a decent team is some trust and some talent, and we've got both, but we've got to fix some stuff first to make the talent shine.   ITEM THREE:  My brother and sister in law were home last weekend.  I'd really just as soon they never come home again.  All my brother did was spend the entire weekend telling me how dumb I am and how I'm always wrong and how I don't know anything.  And then, of course, there's the inevitable fight about our sister, which leads to him reminding me just how much that was my fault and then of course he punches me.  Which, like I said, is standard.  Of course, this time he punched me in the knee, so it hurt more than usual.  My sister in law doesn't ever know what to do or say during these interactions, and if she did say anything, he'd yell at her.  My mother is never around for them, not that she'd defend me.  My dad is, well, my dad so he doesn't care enough to be in the same room with any of us.  And I can't punch him back, because then I get in trouble, and it's just too much hassle to defend myself against him.  Why deal with another lifetime's wrath of my family's bad side instead of just dealing with my asshole brother for a weekend?  This is why I hate my family so often.  When you have to make that choice, you know something is seriously fucked up.   ITEM FOUR:  A little March Madness discussion.  My brackets are totally fucked up.  Yes, on a few of them I did pick UNI to upset Georgia Tech.  I had to.  I wouldn't have been able to live with myself had I not and they actually pulled it out.  Of course, all of my brackets, save one, still have a shot at the final game (barring a loss by Oklahoma State as we speak [edit: they won on a last second three--WOOOOO!]).  And you know that Kansas is going to go to the finals this year, just because for the first time in 4 years I didn't pick them to win the whole shebang, so they're going to do it to spite me.  That's how it works, really.  Stanford's loss wasn't a shock to me.  Michigan State's was.  Kentucky's was.  Gonzaga's was.  Mississippi State's was.  Those all hurt.  Gonzaga less so, but still it hurt.   ITEM FIVE:  How much was that UNI v Georgia Tech game a heartbreaker.  Down by 17 in the first half and battling back to take the lead toward the end of the second?  Giving the last shot (where we need a three) to the best three-point shooter on the team (Ben Jacobson), and having it go long by just a smidge?  Oh the humanity!  They came so damned close to playing cinderella that the glass slipper was in the shoppe being fitted for the panther paw.  And the way Georgia Tech has been winning (by 4 or fewer points) since then, I would like to say that we could have played with any of the teams left in that bracket.  How sweet would that game yesterday have been with UNI instead of Georgia Tech.  The battle for the elite eight slipper between Nevada and UNI?  UGH!  So close.  SO SO close!   ITEM SIX:  My grandma is having some health issues as of late.  A few weeks ago she was complaining about intense shoulder pain.  She assumed it was from her tendinitis surgery a long while ago (ten, maybe fifteen years ago), but it was so bad that she decided to head for the doctor to get it checked.  Well, the doctor said that it was probably from that, but they wanted her to have a stress test, just in case.  It is her left shoulder, afterall.  Well, about ten days ago, she did the stress test, and the results alarmed (mildy) the doctors, so she has to see a cardiologist on Monday.  She's so rediculously nervous that she doesn't sleep and doesn't eat and just doesn't function properly.  She's sure it's going to be the worst news ever.  What she fails to recognize is that if it was a matter of life and death, they would have had her meet with a cardiologist immediately, instead of ten days later.  But she's freaking out anyway, and in her freaking out, she's just making her blood pressure go up, which is completely unhealthy for her.  Hopefully everything turns out alright on Monday, and I'm fairly sure it will, but if it doesn't, you probably won't hear much from me for a while.   ITEM SEVEN:  Here's something new and annoying now that mom doesn't see me as the devil incarnate anymore.  If I'm sitting doing whatever I'm doing at the moment, and not looking like the happiest person on the fucking planet, she demands to know what's wrong and then tells me to smile.  What if I don't feel like smiling?  What if nothing is wrong?  What if I just feel like sitting and reading the newspaper or watching television without putting on a faux happy face just to make her feel better?  It's not my job to appear pleasant at all times.  It's not even my job to pretend that I am not annoyed when I am.  It's also not my job to smile every time she talks to me so she doesn't think something is pissing me off.  No, when I have a long day at work and get home and sit down, I don't have to be the mary sunshine she wants me to be.  I've never been that person, and I never will be that person.  Mary sunshine is someone I've never been.  Mary sunshine is someone who clearly has mental problems, because no one is that happy all the time.  And, just in case it's not obvious, I don't do faux feelings.  If I'm happy, you'll know it.  If I'm not, you'll know that, too.  Thing is, if I'm not, don't ask me why, either.  If I want to tell you, I will.  I usually don't want to, and the more I'm asked about it, the more angry I get about it, so leave it the hell alone, okay!   ITEM EIGHT:  Okay, let's just revisit that brother and sister-in-law visit I was blathering about earlier.  Do you know what kinds of shit I had to do to make the place presentable for them?  I had to scrub the house top to bottom, give up my bed, and give up my basement oasis.  This normally would not bother me.  Normally.  So why does it bother me now?  Well, I live here now.  Not to mention that when I didn't live here, my parents didn't bother to even make sure there were any clean dishes in the house, let alone clean the bathroom or kitchen floors.  This house is a disaster area on most days.  I wouldn't invite people over here because it's embarassing.  BUT, I'm at work from about 8am to 8pm Monday through Friday (and occasionally half the day on Saturday), so I don't have a damned bit of time or energy to devote to cleaning my mother's house when my mother is here all day long every day.  I came home on Friday and she was still in her bathrobe--she didn't "feel like doing anything" yesterday.  And apparently everything includes close a fucking cupboard door.  Or put the cereal back in the cereal cupboard.  Or put the milk back in the fridge.  But my point is that I shouldn't have to clean her house to make room for her son to come home and abuse me.  And I certainly shouldn't have to sleep on the fouton (sp?) when the bed in my room actually belongs to me and was purchased by me.  Not to mention that when I want to get up in the morning and run, my clothes are all in that room, and my clothes when I get out of the shower are all in that room.  And my oasis in the basement is mine.  I don't want other people in there moving things around and disrupting my...well, I don't know, but they're disrupting it, damnit.  My brother actually ripped the remote out of my hand while sitting on my couch and turned my vcr off and then turned the channel on my television to something that looked a goddamned lot like fishing.  No.  Just no.  I fucking hate that.  I hate not having the remote in my hand and not being in complete control of my watching ability.  And I hate it even more that I go to the basement so that I can have that control because my mother's taste in television is summed up in four words: Law & Order and Home & Garden.  So that's my tv down there.  And my remote.  And my couch.  And my pillows.  And my blankets.  And my VCR.  And my DVD player.  And my lamps.  And my rugs.  And mine!  And my fucking brother takes it over like he fucking owns the place.  Oh, and before you ask why I didn't sleep on my couch in my basement?  My brother was sleeping there because it was "too hot" in my bedroom upstairs.  So my sister in law slept in my bed.  My brother slept on my couch.  I slept in the computer room on the hard, too-short fouton with a sheet and a throw pillow.  In my own fucking place of residence.  Yeah, so that's all I have to rant about at the moment.  Seems like a lot, I know, but It's a couple of week's worth of stuff.  And in my life?  A couple of weeks can be a small lifetime.

      Okay, I just finished reading a weblog entry by someone who I describe as the biggest idiot I know.  Which is, of course, saying something.  She blathered on and on (and on and on) about how people are more honest online, and therefore this is proof to anybody who ever doubted her honesty that she is, in fact, telling us the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help her god.  WHATEVER!    Yeah, she does tell the truth.  Occasionally and when it suits her.  And perhaps in her very own pea brain she thinks she's the most honest person in the world.  But realistically, let's all just remember one of the things she's said (in writing) that makes her statement of solumn truth complete bullshit.  She lied to one of her supposed friends about doing something, that any human being with two brain cells rubbing together would know was unlikely, not to mention blatantly false.  If she'd actually done said thing, she'd have offered proof.  Another item of proof for you, if you please.  In the same goddamned blurb, she wrote about how she never divulges personal details in public webspace.  Lie.  She'll take any and every opportunity to blather on about herself so long as the attention returns back to her (oh, and her illness, let's not forget the illness).  Oh, and I could probably give you her credit rating if I were a bit more evil, but I'm not, so I won't.  Let's just say that at 30-something, one should not still be using mommy's credit card to buy and return merchandise at will.  To tell you the truth, I can also relate the ballpark of her mother's credit rating.  And on another note, the shit about the guy at the store?  He's a salesman, you nit!  He gets paid to be nice to you.  And if was really as nice as you say he was, he's a really damned good salesman.  Of course, as is my guess (and the guess of my best friend who just finished reading the same story), her mention of her career (okay, not career, but it just as well be, seeing as she's at it every minute of the day) sent him into full on compliment mode.  She runs a fucking message board that talks about makeup, so why wouldn't this salesperson (who sells cosmetics) kiss up to her when she presents it as a beauty website?  That just makes sense, doesn't it?  Wouldn't that be what you would do if you were a salesman for a product?  I know I would.  One more thing.  Stop telling everyone "I'm so hot" or "Everyone says I'm so hot."  Even if you think it, just don't put it in writing in a public forum where other people are forced to be nice and agree with you.  And because we all know that I'm not nice and I don't tend to agree just to be nice, I'll let it be said that she is NOT hot and her makeup is NOT attractive and if you have such noticeable eyeshadow on your face that a person walks up to you (a complete stranger) and says "I love your eyeshadow," chances are good that you look like a fucking clown.  Now that this rant is all off my chest, I have something else to say.  I'm SO hot!  I mean, drop dead gorgeous.  My hair is perfect.  My makeup is flawless.  My body is slammin'.  And my personality is above and beyond perfect.  See how that sounds?  See why no one should ever say it?  I think my point is made.  [For the record, none of those things are true, and you can try to flatter me by disagreeing, but then I'll just call you a chump, mmkay?]  Okay, I'm getting divebombed by ladybugs so I need to move from this room.  I'll catch up with you all later.  I have a list of things to rant about when I return (after I fumigate this fucking room)!

      Someone remind me again why it is that I thought that third cup of green tea was a good idea.  I'm wide the hell awake and tired enough to sleep standing up, if that makes any sense at all.  I didn't fall asleep until well after 4am last night, and I'm guessing it's going to be more of the same tonight.  A year ago, that would have been almost normal.  Between then and now, I figured out the value of sleep (and was also actually able to sleep), and I love it!  My whole sleep schedule has been thrown off by my recent excursions, and now the rediculous amounts of caffeine I'm putting in my body (which didn't used to affect me at all) keep my sleep schedule all helter skelter.  Let's talk March Madness for a second.  UNI is in!  Iowa and Iowa State are out (probably meeting at some point in the NIT).  As of this moment, ESPN.com's Bracketologist has UNI seeded 13th and playing 4th seeded Illinois.  I don't love that matchup, because I'd love to see a Big Ten team make the final four, and my pick to do so would be Illinois (because both Wisconsin and Michigan State aren't terribly consistent these days).  A Big Ten team generally always makes the final four, and seeing as there will only be three of them dancing this year because of the media's claims that the Big Ten is "down" this year, the chances are drastically reduced that the regular will occur.  And don't even get me going on the media's bias toward the Big East and the ACC (and the SEC, and the Atlantic 10 this year), while still telling the country (ad nausium) that both the Big Ten and Big 12 are down this year, when really it's more a case of parity.  There is no one superstar team in either of those conferences this year because the top half of the teams in both conferences are all really good, thereby depleting the win-loss record for all involved.  Don't tell me that Michigan, Iowa or Purdue couldn't beat two opponents in the big dance.  Don't tell me Oklahoma, Missouri or Colorado couldn't either, because when it comes down to it, those teams have a lot to prove, and when a team has a lot to prove, they often outperform even their own expectations.  And don't tell me they're taking teams away from the mid-majors.  I'm a mid-major girl!  I understand the concept, I do.  BUT, if they're going to take Florida State, Washington, Louisville, Charlotte or Alabama, then surely they should be looking at Iowa, Michigan, Purdue, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Colorado.  Let's take a closer look at Louisville.  They started off the season an astounding 16-1.  Does anyone remember where that loss came from?  Anyone?  Iowa.  On a neutral court.  And speaking of home and away advantages, let's look at Florida State.  Florida State managed to win a grand total of 0 ACC games on the road this year.  The same can be said for Iowa State, but they're not even close enough to the bubble to see it.  And Iowa State knocked off Texas, Kansas, UNI (which now counts for something because at last glance, our RPI is up about 27 points to 68--oh, and we're in the dance) at home, and for all intents and purposes, beat Kansas at Kansas (blame that shit on the refs--they fucked up and it cost ISU three points, and the win).  Washington got trounced in their first five Pac10 games against teams like Cal, UCLA, and Oregon State.  They pulled their own ass out of the fire the last week, but two wins over a drastically overranked Arizona shouldn't weigh heavily on the committee's mind as "good wins."  Shit, let's even look at the number 1 team in the nation (before their conference tournament trouncing): Saint Joseph's?  An Atlantic 10 team, who plays absofrickinglutely no one in conference play (don't tell me Dayton or Xavier is a better team than Kansas or Michigan State, because I don't buy it) is the number one team in the NCAA?  Who the hell is in charge of this shit?  I can live with the constant bias toward Duke.  I can live with the constant playing up of the ACC.  But when conferences like the Big East, Conference USA and the SEC start getting bids for more than 5 teams, something in this logic starts to reek!  I'm a firm believer that if you can't go .500 or higher in conference play and/or can't win your conference tournament, then you don't deserve to dance.  I don't care if you've beat 14 RPI 1-25 teams.  If you can't win at least half of the games that matter (read: conference games), then I don't want to see your stinky ass cluttering up my brackets come selection Sunday.  All that practice does is reward mediocrity, and let the teams know that for those 16-18 games of the season, it really doesn't matter at all.  Now, I understand that for some teams, the conference tournament also serves as the same sort of incentive.  Suck all season, but play four games in four days and you're dancing.  The difference here, being, though, that by running the table of a conference tournament, you have just proven to the committee that you can win games when you know your season is on the brink of being terminated.  Regular season slacking, on the other hand, shows everyone that you can't even beat the guys in your league, so why should the committee think you can beat anyone outside of your league.  *light flashes on*  I just had a brilliant idea (okay, maybe not brilliant).  Why don't we just do away with selection completely.  Let's do it this way.  Throughout the season, depending on how well a particular conference performs against other conferences (similar to the ACC/Big Ten challenge), seed the conferences in the tournament.  Then, hold the conference tournaments as usual, and when you win your conference tournament, you get the conference's bid to the dance.  There is no at large.  There is no play-in game.  There is every team in Division I vying for the national title.  So, for instance if Duke wins the ACC tournament tomorrow, they get the Number 1 seed that their conference gets.  They're paired against the winner of the worst conference--for the purpose of this rant, I'm going to say it's the WAC, which is not to say they are the worst conference--Nevada.  No other teams from the ACC continue on, and no other teams from the WAC continue on.  So, how, you ask, would the conferences wind up seeded?  The teams play as usual, but not necessarily against each other.  The teams are judged on record and strength of schedule to determine conference seeding.  The conference is also judged on overall RPI and SOS (similar to the way it's done now) to determine their NCAA seed.  So, essentially, the entire conference is holding all of its teams accountable for a decent seeding, which they all are eligible for at the beginning of the conference tournament.  Teams would be less likely to hold their conference seed down by scheduling easy wins if they had better insentive not to.    I don't know.  It makes sense to me, but it's late and I'm tired and caffeined up and it might not make any sense at all.

      ...yes, I'm home.  Yes, that  is  Mr H you guys around here have seen me with (why you didn't ask me when you saw me is a bit of a mystery).  No, he's not here to stay, he's leaving tomorrow.  Yes, he was supposed to fly back to Italy on Sunday.  No, I didn't know he was coming here instead.  Yes, I did take the day off on Friday so I could take him to the airport on Thursday evening and not have to worry about getting back in the car and getting home at 4am.  Yes, you probably have seen him before.  No, he's never been here before, so you didn't see him around here.   Yes, his mom is nice, but his stepdad is a nutjob.  Yes, we did finally have fun when we got to Seattle.  Yes, his hand is healing nicely.  Yes, his sister probably will get the job, but she's going to turn it down.  Yes, we did go to EMP, and yes, I did say hello to Pam for you (whereby she looked at me like I had four heads and I had to remind her who the hell I was).  Yes, the mentioned (to some) friend of Mr H's that we visited is someone some of you know.  No, he's not an asshole anymore.  Yes, Melissa has driven by my house more than four times a day this week trying to zero in on who it is that is in my house.  Yes, I did wave at her when I saw her through the window.  Yes, I did see her not paying attention to the street in front of my house and nearly hit you, Jen.  No, she still hasn't called me to find out the dirt, but I expect the call any minute now.  No, I don't know why she still calls me.  Yes, it does annoy me.  Yes, I did know she got fired and yes, I did laugh when I saw the moving truck.  You people clearly forget we're related and this town is the size of a gnat.  I realize it's difficult to remember, because we've loathed each other since birth.  Yes, I did notice that her sister is now back home, too, and I'm sure my cousin will fill me in on that dirt as soon as she gets it, and I will pass it on to those parties who feel it would make them feel better.  Who doesn't love it when the over-priviledged, self-righteous, far-too-impressed-with-themselves, completely oblivious to anything remotely negative about themselves, fall flat on their face?  I know I do.  And yes, yes, yes I was the first to laugh my ass off when I found out (purely by mistake) that Melissa's boyfriend threw her out because he was sleeping with her sister (nevermind that she was sleeping with his best friend, as was her sister, but I'm sure she doesn't know that yet).  For those of you I've confused, talk to me this weekend or next week and I'll give you the scoop.  You'll laugh.  I promise.  No, I'm not going to Fayetteville this weekend.  No, I didn't know who all qualified for the meet.  Yes, I am surprised.  Yes, I did know that my Panthers now find themselves with the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.  Yes, I did watch the game.  Yes, it was exciting.  Yes, they should have finished off SMS in regulation instead of stretching it to two overtimes.  Yes, everyone in the state is excited about it.  Yes, I do have a wallpaper I can send you to commemorate it, but it's not very good because I ripped it off of someone else's site and touched it up while supervising study hall this morning.  Yes, you can email me if you really are hard up for it.  No, I don't have anywhere to host it.  Yes, I did color my hair.  Yes, it is brown.  Yes, it's my natural color.  Yes, it probably does look weird, but I've gotten used to it, and so should you.  Yes, Alicia at Spa-dee-dah did it, and yes, it's worth the price.  Yes, that was me with the curly hair that you saw going in the grocery store yesterday.  No, that's not normally how it is, but I decided to embrace the curl that has appeared out of nowhere instead of fight to straighten it.  Yes, it's much easier to go curly than it is to dry it straight (or to dry it at all for that matter).  Yes, I do voluntarily have bangs now.  Yes, they do bug the shit out of me by the end of the day.  And to answer the rest of the questions (christ you people know how to throw out a load of questions at once (more than 8 of you asked me more than three of each of those)), yes, I think so, yes, probably not, no comment, yes, no, that's not any of my business (let alone any of yours), maybe, and I hope so, but I'm not holding my breath.

      Don't worry, it's not me.  I'm in the middle of planning a bridal shower for a girl I've met exactly twice (and both times I was in a foul, anti-social mood--imagine that).  She's marrying my cousin.  Yes, I'm planning a bridal shower from way out west, while I chat with folks in what sounds to be dreadfully dreary Iowa.  How exactly does one plan a bridal shower via instant messenger, anyway?  Well, the better question should be how, or perhaps why do people plan a bridal shower at all.  And better yet, how did I get designated the head shower-planner person?  Isn't that a job for a bridesmaid?  Or an aunt?  Or someone else who isn't me?  And why is it that everything I suggest and explain makes absolutely no sense to the people who are actually sitting in a living room somewhere in Iowa, trying to figure out how exactly to log on to AIM?  Whoever came up with this idea (me planning this, while simultaneously on vacation) was an idiot.  I honestly don't even know who it was, I just know that at some point in the last two months, someone decided that this would be a good idea.  And then when I protested to anyone who'd listen (or whomever I thought might have some say in this) after I found out I'd be on vacation this very weekend (when whoever it is that shoved this job on me decided the planning  must  happen), no one seemed to give two shits.  So, I spent the last three + hours online (where the rate I was being charged is by the hour, so I'm just blowing off the next 32 minutes to get my money's worth), two and a half of which were spent simultaneously on the phone and online, because the group of women back in Iowa couldn't figure out how to log on.  I'm not terribly happy that I've had to spend three + hours dealing with this, when I have a very limited time before Mr H and I must go our separate ways yet again.  Speaking of Mr H and our vacation, it's been good, but weird.  Good in the sense that I'm so elated to spend time with him that the rest of the junk going on almost hasn't mattered.  Almost.  I thought my parents drove me nuts, but his mom and step-dad win the award for most intrusive, interruptive, irritating, and all-around annoying parents ever.  His mom actually isn't so bad (sweet and well-meaning), but she's a floor mat, and her husband is a world-class pain in the ass who thinks it should be his mission in life to disrupt plans, lives, psyches, and make anyone in his path, homicidal.  Mr H doesn't like him at all, and now that I've met and interacted with him, I don't blame him a bit.  Back in Portland, we knew they were going to be there, and that was fine.  They had a room in a hotel close to the airport, and we were downtown, so we figured we'd have at least nights/evenings to ourselves.  Not the case.  His mom merely suggested getting a room in a hotel closer to ours (but not in ours), and within 10 minutes, not only were they in our hotel, they were in the room right next to ours.  Okay, fine, whatever.  At this point, I was still fine with them, but Mr H was less than pleased when he finally got in from Atlanta.  As soon as they heard us in the hall going into the room, they were at the door.  They were in the room until well after Mr H fell asleep.  If you hadn't heard, I suck with the small-talk, especially when I'm tired, so it was just them sitting in our room watching television while Mr H slept and I tried to decide how exactly to ask these people to leave the room so I could go to bed.  Monday morning, Mr H had an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to see if he wanted to have his hand repaired now, or when he gets back in May.  Sounds pretty straight forward, doesn't it?  No, his mom and step-dad wanted to be in the room with him when he met the guy.  I stayed out (which I found out later, I shouldn't have, because I thought of some actual valid questions that would have been helpful), and from the sounds of things, his step-dad not only insulted the surgeon, but he told the man how to do his job.  To the point where this guy almost refused to do the surgery, fearing that no matter the outcome, he'd find himself somewhere in the middle of a lawsuit.  Luckily, Mr H and I doubled back (due to a blatant lie about me leaving my non-existant pager in the office waiting room) after leaving the office so he could talk to the guy and re-assure him that regardless of what his step-dad had to say, Mr H wanted to have the surgery and that his step-dad would have nothing to do with any of it.  So, the surgery was scheduled for Tuesday morning.  Of course, the rest of Monday we spent with his mom and step-dad, because no matter what we came up with, we couldn't get them to give us 10 minutes to ourselves.  Tuesday morning we were going to spend a couple hours just relaxing before we had to go to the hospital, but I woke up really early and instead of bouncing around the room, I decided to go for a run.  When I came back (it had to be no later than 6:45am), there sat his mom and step-dad chattering at him.  His mom was clearly nervous, so I understand her nervous chattering, but his step-dad was doing absolutely nothing to calm anyone's nerves.  He was running down every negative scenario possible (and several that weren't even remotely possible) and then laughing every time he mentioned them.  Mr H, in the meantime, is getting more and more nervous, and at the same time, more and more annoyed with every passing minute.  At this point, to at the very least calm his mother's nerves, I started in on the successes I've had with the same sorts of surgery.  And then the man thought it was a good idea to start arguing with me about all the potential problems.  Now, you all know me, and most of you know that while I tend to be awake fairly early in the day, I'm by no means a morning person.  I get irritated more easily in the morning, and this guy was irritating the hell out of me.  It took damn near every thing I had to not rip into this guy like no one has probably ever ripped into him.  It was bad enough that I had to leave the room for a good 20 minutes, because had I not, I probably would have hit him.  One good thing came out of it, though.  Mr H was all kinds of amused (as he tends to be when I get riled up and ready to spit venom, which I don't understand, but it tends to disarm me, so it's not a bad thing) and it took his mind completely off his nerves.  Mr H politely requested that they wait at the hotel for us to come back, and thank god that they decided to adhere to his request, because I may have beaten the man in the waiting room had they been there.  BUT, the second we got back to the hotel, they came right to the room instead of letting Mr H rest (the pain meds he was on had him extremely tired and a bit loopy).  Every time he'd be just starting to nod off, his step-dad would ask some assenine question.  After about an hour and a half of this, I asked them to leave so he could sleep.  His mom  finally  was able to corale the man and get out of the room (I'm sure she sensed just how annoyed I was becoming, because I'm sure I wasn't hiding it at that point).  After they left, Mr H slept off and on for the rest of the day, mumbling incoherent things here and there and then dozing back off.  Wednesday, we were scheduled to jump in the car and head up to Seattle for the rest of the trip, where his younger sister (and her significant other) was going to be for a job interview.  His parents were not scheduled to accompany us on the trip, and we were supposed to say our goodbyes to them that morning.  At 7am there's a knock at the door and his mom informs me that they're going with us so they can see his sister, too.  Not only did they already have their rental car, but they had called and made reservations in the hotel we were in up there, and they were going to see if they could get a room close to either us or his sister.  As much as Mr H detests his step-dad, his sister detests him more, so I already know this isn't going to be what he (or me, for that matter) wants to hear.  As soon as I shut the door, Mr H was already dialing the phone to find us all somewhere else to stay.  He found it, contacted his sister, and then cancelled both her room and ours in the other hotel.  I know it was sneaky and underhanded, but had we not, this vacation would have been less of a vacation and more a practice in vitriolic restraint out of all of us.  Not to mention that in the middle of a job interview, it would have been the last thing his sister needed.  Interviews are stressful enough.  They've stopped in here and there since then, but we haven't kept them up to date on our plans and schedules, so they've been kept at bay.  They tried to get a room in this hotel, but by the time they got up here, there weren't any that were open until Sunday, so they stayed in our original hotel, which, as it turns out, wasn't as nice as the one we're in now, and we got a deal because of the last-minute booking (sometimes it pays to wait--hotels like to put heads in the beds, so if it's looking like they won't, they'll discount).  So, now that my time is nearly up, and I'm done bitching, I will mention that aside from interaction with his parents, this week has been great.  I really needed to get away from all the crap at home (read: my mother and her obsession with nosing into my business), and it has been great to see Mr H.  Tomorrow morning, we head back down to Portland and then in the evening he flies home and I fly home.  I really don't want to go home.  I really just don't.

      First of all, no dice on that offer for another gmail account.  I've since learned that they did only allow one clickthrough on that offer, so the rest of you who were not lucky enough to get the offer will have to wait until the final release.  It kicks ass, though, so be sure to sign up as soon as it becomes available.  You'll never yahoo again.  On to the promised list of topics.  I might just do part of the list tonight and the rest tomorrow.  Because I'm ridiculously tired, but not quite ready to go to bed yet.  We all know how that is.    Drake Relays   I did actually secure tickets for Saturday.  I got them at the very last minute because someone I knew decided not to go because of the impending monsoon.  What's a little rain and wind when you're talking world-class athletes running world-class times, right? Right.  It was so rainy and so windy, though, that they moved all of the jumps inside.  They NEVER do that.  It was sucky and cold.  The meet was great, though.  I wish I could have made it down for Friday, but due to a badly re-scheduled high school meet I had to coach at, it wasn't possible.  It sounds like I missed some terrific performances and some even more terrific parties.  There really isn't anything like the Drake Relays.  At least not in the US.  The Drake Relays are reportedly very similar to the European meets.  And in Europe, track and field is revered instead of pushed to the side. That's another rant for another day, though.    NFL Draft   I have to tell you that the draft was highly successful for the teams I cheer for (both college and professional).  The Vikings did well.  Pretty much the entirety of the graduating seniors on the Iowa team got either drafted or signed as free agents.  More people from Iowa State got signed as free agents than anyone expected, because if you missed last season, you probably didn't know that they sucked hardcore.  And even a handful of former Panthers got signed, including a former teammate of mine from the track team.  I believe he got signed to Tennessee, but I could be mistaken (I'd go look, but I'd have to dig for a while to find out).  And let's just hear it for Robert Gallery, the second pick in the draft from the University of Iowa.  He should have gone first, because Eli Manning sucks.  And he's a whiny bitch.  And Amy would have been much happier had her football boyfriend not gone to Oakland.  Apparently that is unforgiveable.  I don't know Amy all that well, but she expressed this to me in an IM this week (yes, an IM.  I actually logged on to AIM this week.  More than once.  I'm on it right now, as a matter of fact).    Teases revealed   And now here is where I reveal the tease from the last entry.  I promised you that I'd tell you who was getting married and how the whole engagement went down, not to mention a little more information about myself (that most of you already know).  So here it is.  Jake got engaged.  To the girl he has been dating since last summer (Nikki for those keeping track--and yes, that is yet another Nikki that got engaged to an ex boyfriend of mine).  Nikki and I are friends.  Jake and I are friends.  Do you see any parallels to some other engagement here?  If you don't, well then you've missed out on some major history lessons, and you'll have to email me to find out all about that.  Anyway, that's fabulous news and I'm extremely happy for them.  No date has been reported yet, but I'll keep you posted.  I guess the proposal was pretty straight forward.  He took her to dinner and then in the middle of dinner he proposed to her and she cried and said yes.  I saw the ring before he did it, and it is beautiful. Funny story behind that (isn't there always some sort of funny story? No.  Okay).  When Jake was showing me the ring the weekend I was down in CF, one of our friends from college jumped to major conclusions.  She was half crocked, but she ran around the house telling anyone she could find that not only did Jake and I get back together, but in a matter of an hour we were getting married.  It was funny.  You probably had to be there.  Luckily, that got cleared up prior to Nikki's arrival, so the cat didn't claw its way out of the bag.  So here's the part of the story that will not be new news to most of you.  Jake and I were engaged before.  About a month before I graduated from college, he took me up to a bluff for a picnic (and a break from studying and working and running and being busy all the time).  There was a little rock wall that we always used to sit on when we'd go up there, and he'd hidden the box in a little hole so that it would only be visible to someone looking directly at it.  So, long story a little shorter, at the end of the picnic, he looked at the wall quizically and asked me what that box was.  I pulled it out, opened it (to reveal a grossly over-the-top mass of blinding diamonds--I used to have a link, and if I find it again, I'll edit it in) and he got on his knee and proposed.  I said yes, and we agreed to wait until after graduation to tell anyone (because we knew the probability that someone would jump right into planning a party, shower, rehersal dinner, reception and wedding instead of studying for her finals--you all remember Jill in college, right?  The queen of overplanning, overreaction, overindulgence, and overabundance of cheery, sometimes annoying energy, and the enforcer of all things related to wedding etiquette.  We also called her my roommate and one of my best friends.  She was insane and I stopped talking to her).  Leap forward a month and both parties had cheated, called off the engagement, broken up, and I'd moved out.  Also known as the worst. summer. ever.   2001 sucked, kids.  And now leap forward to the present and we're both happily involved with other people.  Of course, we put each other through another couple years of torture, but we eventually got on with our lives.    The rest. . .   The rest of the list will have to wait until tomorrow or Sunday, because I'm sleepy (and feeling a little ooky), so I'm going to bed.  This may be a record.

      I have a long list of things to talk about, but not the ambition to write it all up.  Consider yourself lucky.  At least for today.  Because eventually I will get around to talking about those items.  The list gets longer as I avoid it.  Just like any to-do list would.  Looks like the gmail offer is still there for me.  I figured once I signed up for it (or declined the offer) it would go away.  It didn't.  I'm tempted to sign up for five addresses through there and claim my username so no one else can have it.  You'd be amazed how quickly my name gets snatched up on these things.  And because I'm nice (when I feel like it), if any of you would like to sign up, email me and I'll see if I can't get you hooked up.  I don't remember if they logged my IP when I signed up, so I'm not sure if I really can get another address, but it wouldn't hurt to look.  Because I like to tease you, part of the list that I mentioned in the first paragraph refers to someone getting married.  Ponder that for a while, and check back often to see all the juicy details, including who, when, where, and how the whole engagement went down.  I'd say what went down, but I think that's pretty self explanatory, no?  And then I'll reveal something about myself that apparently I haven't revealed to all (this will be old news to a bunch of you).  So, stay tuned.

      Okay, either I'm special, or everyone that uses blogger got this offer (I'd bet the latter if I were you), but I was just "chosen" to beta test the new free email service from google.  I, being the collector of email addresses (I signed up for a random one yesterday, too, just to say I have it), signed right on up.  And from what I've seen, gmail fucking rocks!  1000 MB of storage, first of all, rocks my face right off.  Because I'm a packrat in life, and I'm a packrat online.  I don't like to delete anything.  Ever.  Second of all, it's got this handy little feature where it crams all of your replies from a specific email into one "conversation," so if need be, you can refer back to every little big of anything that was sent from the first email to the multiple replies to it.  That explanation wasn't as clear as I'd like it to be, but I understand it, and really, that's probably all that matters.  Because you losers won't get to use gmail until the beta tests are over.  Neener neener.  By the way, that other email address I signed up for yesterday was just because it's the longest domain name on the internet, and I figured you can't go wrong with that--people will remember it, right?  Well, turns out that it doesn't matter because 80% of the current email providers don't recognize the domain, and therefore won't send your message to that address.  They'll receive it.  But won't send it.  Which is only good if you're avoiding spam and any other piece of email.  If you have time, you have to read this article:  urlLink What she doesn't know will kill you .  It's really good, and I don't know a single person who can't relate to it.  Go.  Go read it.  Right now.  Scoot!  Oh, and my original reason for logging in here (before getting distracted by gmail) was to wish Janel a happy 16th birthday.  Don't get a speeding ticket on your first day with your license!  Now, after I've spent the entirety of my evening on the phone and now the last 20 minutes online, I think it's time for bed.  I really have to stop drinking Redbull after 2pm.  Because it takes about 11 1/2 hours before I hit the wall.  I slammed into it about 10 minutes ago.  Stupid wall.

      Because for some reason some channel here is replaying old Campbell's soup comercials, I have that silly little song in my head.  I'll spare you all the pain of me singing it outloud, though.  Nobody needs to have that earworm wiggling in their head.  Anyway, my weekend was really good.  Lots o' fun was had by all (well, most anyway), and it was a nice visit back to the old stomping ground.  First of all, let's just get this out of the way right at the start.  Juri was awesome when I was a freshman, and he remains awesome to this day.  There really wasn't much doubt that he would be, but I just thought I'd tell you anyway.  It really is difficult to beat a hungarian pole vaulter in terms of coolness, isn't it?  I mean, come on.  How many of you can say you know someone cooler than that?  The only people even remotely close to the cool factor of Juri are Balazs and Levante, because they're just insane hungarian distance runners.  Pshhh.  Hungarians are just cool.  Straight up nerdy cool.  For those of you unlucky enough to have been somewhere other than CF this weekend, you should know that Juri and Levi have both shunned the scissors.  The hair is plain out of control.  I've only seen a few white men with an afro, but these two were rocking it, hardcore.  In talking to Jake, he's all kinds of jealous that the fro-ness of Juri's hair has outdone his attempts back in '99, so I will make this prediction right here.  Come US trials, Jake will be rocking the manshee.  Nobody outdoes Jake in the hair department.  It makes him jealous and causes his folicles to grow like a mo-fo.  Okay, that may not be true, but seriously, I've never seen hair grow faster, and his  will  be growing through the remainder of the spring.  And let's just discuss Levi with a full head of hair, for a moment.  For those of you unaware, Levi (Levante) was the biggest clean-cut, nothing but business fool in college.  Since his days in the chem lab ended, he's shown us that he wasn't actually full of shit when he said his (now formerly) shaved head actually could grow some hair.  Curly hair.  Maybe not curly, so much as nappy, but it's long and large.  Wait, that sounded dirty.  Anyway, big fro-y black hair.  On this tiny little hungarian boy.  It's funny shit and if you ever get a chance, you need to ask to see my pictures.    Or maybe you just need to ask me to develop them.  I suck at that.  I still have three rolls from spring break of my Junior year.  I don't even know what's on two of them.  Because I was drunk and someone took my camera.  Ah, that's another story.  Back to the one at hand...  So, Friday night I got down there just in time to meet up with the team coming out of the dining hall.  There was much bitching because life is not the same now that Campbell dining hall is closed (or turned into a giant sitting room as I came to find out while fully expecting to surprise some people, only to find out that the old hall is no longer serving the best taco salad on the planet, and instead only serving up a round of drinking fountain water or pop-machine soda).  They really ought to clear those kinds of things with people that count.  Like me.  Okay, maybe not, but I wanna know where dining center Russ went?  And Carla.  And Roxanne.  And her sister Lila.  Where did they send those folks when CDC was closed and its patrons were sent to the ghastly Towers dining center?  I need answers!  Well, as soon as I got there, I got the scoop on where all of us old foggies were going to be partaking in the twilight eve festivities.  Turns out that Eric is back in town (we all leave, but we never stay gone--we're like a nasty virus) and living in the once-creepy, now-renovated house directly across the street from the track.  Come on now, you all know the kind of debauchery that goes on when runners get together in direct sight of the track while participating in drinking games that we actually used to be really good at.  That's right.  Naked beer mile.  Okay, for most of us, semi-naked beer mile.  Because some of us (read: myself and the rest of the fairer gender) are more paranoid than we were in college.  I am proud to say that I, per usual, won.  This, however, seems to be up for debate, seeing as I was wearing clothes.  Some people (read: Eric and Jason, who came in second and third, respectively) think I should be disqualified for having the good sense to put shorts on under my jeans while nobody was paying attention.  Eh, oh well.  I know I won.  And they know they got beat by a girl.  HA!  Somewhere during all of this debauchery, I found something out about Jake, which I'll share with you as soon as I possibly can.  It's not bad news, and it has absolutely nothing to do with me.  I just can't tell you because some of the people that are involved read this site and I don't want to jump the gun on it.  I promised I wouldn't say anything, so no matter how much you beg, I won't tell you until I get the all-clear.  But you can remind me periodically, otherwise I'll forget to spill it on here for those people I don't see or talk to all that often.  So, after I won the beer mile (we didn't time it this year, mostly because the only watch available was on Jason's wrist, and he was too drunk to unhook the band), we headed for the hill.  Which was a real drag (where the hell did Steb's go? It's just a pile of dirt now.  And what happened to Tony's and Sharky's?  They sucked hardcore with all their underage little girls.  They used to have standards), so we continued walking until we found some random kid's party to crash.  Hey, that's what you get for living in Eric's old girlfriend's best friend's house.  You have a party and some drunk strangers will come in and crank it up for you.  It's really just a service, because your party needed some help.  And you know you enjoyed it, even though you tried to get us to leave for the first two minutes.  Right up until Elly started flirting with you.  And then you were fine with it.  Go figure.  By the time the party ended (had to be around 4am), we all kind of dispersed for our beds.  Better planning on my part would have been to direct the mob (12 people) back toward Jeff's house after the hill.  I should mention to those who've never been that the hill is really a string of bars on a hill near campus.  And not so much on the hill as at the bottom of it.  It's a downhill roll from Eric's and the track and Jeff's and everything else except the group of houses where we attended the party (really, man , thanks for a good party, whoever you were).  Oh, and Jeff?  Lives in a house further up the hill from Eric's.  About 22 blocks further up the hill.  It took the smattering of people headed to Jeff's until nearly 5:30am to get home.  Mostly because we had to damn near carry Jason, but it was actually all uphill.  I loved to run up that hill when I was sober.  Well, I sort of loved to--I used to do it because it's good for me, not because I wanted to, and I never, ever ran up the entire thing--that would have blown up every muscle in my body.  But walking all the way up that hill in non-running shoes, while drunk and dragging another drunk?  It's 40 blocks of sheer hell.  We should have just slept on Eric's floor.  Or in the smattering of tents we saw along the way.  Afterall, it was damn near 90 degrees on Saturday, and Friday night/Saturday morning didn't get below 70 degrees.  Shit, we could have just slept in the press box of the track complex.  We all have keys anyway.  Well, we (the three of us--the only three that were staying there) finally got back and then slept.  And slept.  And slept.  I woke up at about 1 and started waking people, because we were supposed to be at the track at 12:30 to start officiating the field events.  I can assure you that they told us 12:30 for this very reason.  Buck knows all of us, and he knew that none of us would be there before 1:30.  And none of us were.  None of us were there until about 1:45.  And we were the first ones there at that time.  The rest of the crew didn't roll in until 2:30 (about a minute and a half before the meet was scheduled to start).  And those fools only had to walk across the parking lot.  I'm fairly certain they were pointing and laughing at us from the windows while we were trying to switch the vault pit from the North runway to the South (fucking wind, man!).  They should have heavy machinery to do that job, because it sucks greatly.  Ah, and then the meet started.  I haven't been around a college meet in far too long.  The talent.  The crowd.  The people that know what's going on while both watching and officiating the meet.  The coaches that actually did compete in the sport at one time in their life.  My god I miss that.  Some days I wonder why some of the other coaches are even bothering trying to coach their girls.  They have no idea what they're doing, because they've honestly never run in their lives.  It'd be like me trying to teach someone how to pole vault.  I've never done it, and therefore should never try to teach it.  There are too many high school coaches that are not qualified to coach the sport they're employed to coach.  I can name four such coaches that I know of in my own school, and it makes me crazy.    After the meet was the obligatory post-meet party.  Not near the level of debauchery at this party because the current athletes are involved and they're all in pre-drake form, basically saying no thanks to the drinks and heading home early to keep their bodies well-rested.  As an aside, I am really bummed that I'm not going to Drake this year because I waited too long and couldn't get Saturday-Sunday tickets.  If I didn't have to work Wednesday through Friday, I'd totally take off and go watch the early rounds and multi-events, but I have to work, so I can't go.  And I know that Kellie is going to be extraordinarily pissed at me because of it--so, I'm sorry.  I tried.  Unless you can scrape together another set of Sat-Sun tickets, I'm shit outta luck.  Yes, that was a hint.  Anybody with an extra ticket for either or both days, you need to call me or email me as soon as possible.  And if you have an on-field pass, I'll pay extra.  Whatever you want.  So, back to the post-meet party.  Most of the kids bailed early.  I say kids as though I'm so much older than they are, but that's not the case.  Technically, according to NCAA policy, I could still be eligible to compete.  Well, had I not gone to school until I was 20, I could be, but I'm not even older than all the athletes on the team right now, so I don't feel quite so ancient.  Anyway, once the kids bailed, we (us old-fogies) headed back to Eric's.  Since we're all old now, we were all alched out from the previous night's festivities, so we just watched movies until we all fell asleep.  Sadly, this was before 2am.  By 3am, we were all awake though.  A tornado warning horn less than 20 yards from your open windows will do that to you.  There's really nothing more fun than hearing a tornado siren go off after sleeping for an hour and trying to figure out where in a house with just a crawl space are you going to cram 16 people should the angry sky actually produce a tornado.  And then there's me, who at the hint of bad weather, just walks right outside to see for herself.  I LOVE storms.  LOVE them.  I've chased a tornado before.  Of course, I was far enough away from it that had it turned toward me, I could have scurried away, but chased nonetheless.  So, myself and a handful of other people grabbed a flashlight (in case the power went out) and went outside, knowing full well that if it did get as nasty as the siren indicated it could, we could run to the press box, which has a lower level used for storage.  In the flashes of lightning we saw a couple wall clouds and three (possibly four) funnel clouds, but no touch downs (none even remotely close, really).  Coolest weather-related thing I've seen in a long while.  At one point, we encountered the weather spotters (a group of volunteers trained to spot tornados and report back to the county and national weather service) who told us that "you kids should be taking shelter right now."  To which we all (fairly simultaneously) replied that if something should approach, we'd have a better shot of finding and getting to shelter than the weather spotters would.  The somewhat large head weather spotter man didn't know whether to be offended by the statements or whether to laugh because he knew we were right.  Like I said, nothing ever happened, so we never needed to run to shelter, so no need to call and yell at me for risking my life.  Save yourself the dime.  You already know it will do no good.  Silly monkeys.  And now I'm back home.  The ride home was eventful in the sense that I got hammered by a nasty little storm on my way back and had an encounter with a truck driver.  And by nasty, I mean baseball-sized hail and ridiculously high winds and a jacknifed semi.  The semi was already wonked up in the ditch when I got to it, but it hadn't been there long, as the driver was just climbing out of the cab.  I, being the good samaritan I can be, pulled over because it was just starting to absolutely pour and I was the only other fool trying to drive through that crap for what seemed like 20 miles.  And yes, I did have my cell phone with 911 dialed with my finger resting lightly on the dial button should the truck driver try anything, so you can spare yourself the dime on that one, too.  But I took the truck driver, Randy, who had called the highway patrol from his own cell phone to tell them of the accident and to let them know that he was fine (he'll feel that tomorrow, I'm guessing) and that he was getting a ride to the nearest town for some shelter.  The nearest town in that particular area was about 12 miles away and had exactly one store in it, which, luckily, was an open cafe.  Me, being as antsy as always, decided to just leave him there (where he phoned the highway patrol again to tell him where he was should they need to talk to him--I'm sure they did--and to jokingly tell them that if they see me on the road today and I'm speeding to let me off with a warning, because I did a good deed.  While that was a nice gesture, it sort of let the police know that I speed and I'd really just as soon they not know that, because I speed all the time (and in my nervous small talk with him, had told him so) and I have never gotten a ticket for it, and never really hope to.  So, you know, thanks and shut up.  So, I'm on the road again and the rain starts to let up.  I, not thinking clearly, think this to be a good thing, completely not noticing the large dark clouds that I'm driving directly into.  And then it starts.  The hail.  It starts out small--pea sized I'd say--so I just keep driving.  It starts to get bigger, so I slow down to a near crawl.  And then it starts throwing baseballs at my precious car.  I'm nowhere near an overpass and nowhere near an exit ramp and nowhere near anything that could be of any use in such a situation.  My car takes the beating and then it starts to pour like it means it and I can't even get going, because I can't see a damned thing.  About 20 minutes later, the rain just stopped.  No letting up.  It just went from pouring to nothing.  I didn't even want to get out and look at my car yet, so I just waited until I got home.  Oh the dents.  We're talking  major  hail damage.  Luckily the windows are fully intact, but the rest of the car looks like an acne-ridden teen's face.  So, tomorrow I have to call my auto insurance agent and get the claims guy out to look at it.  That's fabulous.  They've probably missed me since I haven't bugged them in such a long time.  Or, rather, such a long time for me.    Rhonda Shear is hocking control-fit underwear on television.  I know that's random of me to say, but I just flipped past HSN and this is what I see.  You all remember her from "USA Up All Night," right?  She is far less attractive than she used to be.  And she wasn't all that attractive before.  Time has not been well to her.  But her shoes are hot, so I'm over it.  Amazing what I'll forgive you for if you're wearing a kick ass pair of shoes, isn't it.  Must. Get. Sleep.  Too much Redbull.

      Alright, I've figured it out.  I'm pretty sure I figured it out a long time ago and probably frequently since then, but most likely forgot that I already knew the reason.  What am I talking about?  Well, I figured out why I ramble on like a babbling idiot on this thing.  Some of you are sighing with relief, believing that I will stop it now that I've realized why I do it.  It's an unfortunate day for you, my friend, because I will likely continue rambling and rambling and rambling, because it's just what I do.  Ask anyone who's ever received an email from me written between the hours of midnight and 6am.  And quite a few written between 6am and midnight.  Okay, so I ramble like this because I spend the majority of my day not speaking at all.  Because contrary to popular belief, I do, actually, hold my tongue and not let every single thought or gripe I have fly directly out of my mouth.  In fact, most people find me to be a very quiet and somewhat calculated person (not in the scheming, caniving way, but rather in the way I don't speak unless I actually have something important to say and an effective way of saying it).  Most of you that know me in person know this to be true.  I sit on a thought until I've properly crafted a way to say it so it makes sense to me and to the person I'm speaking to.  Because if I hate anything, I hate having to explain things I've said because they didn't come out clearly.  This always got me into trouble in school, because I really didn't like raising my hand to contribute until I'd crafted the perfect answer or perfect question or perfect comment.  Which is dumb, but it's just how I am.  Why, you might ask, is it that I do not employ the same standards for written thought?  Because when I sit down to write something, I write or type everything that comes to my mind.  EVERYTHING.  There's no editing, no crafting, no nothing.  Just free flowing thought.  Once I've done some adequate purging of thoughts, time permitting, I go back and fix things so they make more sense or edit some things out.  You can't even imagine what I actually write that doesn't make it to the click of the final publish button or the click of the send button.  Sometimes I edit out words or phrases that don't make sense.  Sometimes I edit out entire subjects and their offspring (we're all aware that my thoughts spill over into new thoughts and those spill into other thoughts and it's really just a stream that usually doesn't make a lot of sense anywhere but in my head).  When I go back and read some of my old entries here or old emails I've sent, I usually appreciate the ones where I didn't have time to edit.  Most of you don't appreciate those nearly as much as I do, and I don't blame you.  Like I said, most of that stuff only makes sense in my head.  I'm able to look at those and see exactly what I was thinking and why, where most of you look at them and think, "girl needs some sleep," all the while giggling like a monkey at some of the randomness of it all.  In reading over the archives from this site for the past few months, I realized that the edited posts made it sound a lot like "oh, poor me,"  when in fact, my head didn't mean it to sound that way at all.  I'm not a "poor me" kind of person.  No, really, I'm not.  I'm more of a "hey, this happened and it sucked, it was probably from something I did and I hate everyone involved at the moment and it may or may not pass, so now let's move on" kind of person.  What's the difference, you ask?  Well, the difference is that the first creates pity, which I loathe.  The second creates a bit of self-awareness (because let's face it, I'm really good at doing the wrong thing at the wrong time), a bit of a warning as to my mood, and a bit of what I like to call my own private inside joke.  The joke being that everyone I know knows that I hated them at one point.  Because I hate everyone at some point.  But I move on.  Some people come with me, some people don't.  The ones that don't may get verbally jabbed (some physically--okay, that only happened once, but I'm still not apologizing for it) for the rest of my natural life, but that's just how I am, and I've become okay with it because if you hadn't noticed, I don't really do the whole change thing very well.  And it sucks to admit this, but if I still hate you after a long period of time, it's because I actually did like you once and I'm probably more pissed at myself for that than I am busy hating you.  Either that or you fucked me over greatly and I'd like to drive a bus over your head.  Or in at least one case I'm actually mad at everyone else for failing to realize what a fucktard you are, even after it was blatantly obvious to the whole goddamned free world.  So what am I saying?  I know I ramble and I ramble because I have to.  Imagine the explosion of my brain if I didn't let some of this crap out of my head on a semi-regular basis.  It would be catastrophic to most within a 400 mile radius.  Oh shit, I should go to bed.  We had a meet tonight that went late, so my body clock is a little off and I didn't even notice it was damn near 2am.  Shit.  I'm going to be a bit cranky in the morning.  At least it's only Study Hall.  I guess I'll sleep sometime on Sunday afternoon, because my weekend is full of things to do.  I'm returning to Cedar Falls for a visit.  A real visit this time, none of this bus in, sit for three hours, bus out bullshit.  I have a lot more catching up to do with a lot more people than three hours will allow for.  And my big dopey Juri will be there.  I love me some Juri.  Does anyone not love Juri?  Even if you don't know Juri, you absolutely have to love him!  Because if you don't, you're just plain dumb.

      Not too much to say tonight.  And you all know that "not too much" usually means I'll ramble on for what seems to be a few pages, right?  Let's talk about Easter weekend, shall we?  Okay, we shall.  Wednesday afternoon sometime, presumably while mom was in the waiting room waiting for my grandmother's angiogram to be completed, my aunt invited the entire family to our house for Easter dinner.  In a normal household, this would not be an issue.  In our household, it turns into some sort of fancy catered event.  Okay, not really fancy, but fancy enough that you would think these were complete strangers coming to our house instead of my mother's sisters and parents and nieces and nephew.  The really great part about the whole thing was that nobody even mentioned this to me until Friday, so I had no choice but to help mom all day Saturday.  So, my entire Saturday (which I'd planned to use for relaxation and release from the early-week dramatics) was blown.  Blown even moreso when I awoke bright and early Saturday morning only to hear the impending achy groan from the general direction of the mom-shaped-lump on the sofa.  Yep, mom with a headache.  She's worthless in the cleaning department when she's well, but when her head hurts, she should just leave the house or go to bed and leave the rest of us alone.  So, the entirety of the cleaning fell on my shoulders.  I've bitched endlessly about how unconcerned with housekeeping my mother is.  It'd been a few days since I had tackled the kitchen (something that should be done daily in this house because anytime mom or dad are in the house, the counters are piled full of dirty dishes).  Someone (dad, I presume) had spilled a can of pop on the floor in front of the fridge, so it was nice and sticky.  The coffee pot had apparently overflowed the day before, because there were grounds on the floor.  The garbage was flowing out of the trash can onto the floor.  The dining room table and chairs were piled with millions of bits of paper that I have no knowledge of, nor do I need to.  Dad had moved his vast sea of plants up to sit in front of the deck door to get some real sunlight, so it was a forest of leaves and dirt.  There is no separation between the living room, dining room and kitchen, not to mention that the stairs going to the second floor are open.  The living room was wall to wall newspapers and more dirty dishes.  Mom got ambitious one day this week and took down about twelve more christmas decorations, so they were sitting in the living room on top of the box they're supposed to go in.  This, of course, was just the main floor (or rather, most of the main floor).  The basement wasn't terrible, although there was a bunch of crap sitting on the table that I neither knew where it went, nor did I know what most of it was.  Dad brought a bunch of car-related parts home and piled them up there.  I don't know why and I learned not to ask.  Anyway, my point to all this blathering is that there was a shit load to clean and barely enough hours in the day to finish it.  Not to mention that the food all had to be prepared yet and in time for me to get at least a couple hours of sleep before getting up at 4:30am so I could be to church by 6am.  Because it's Easter, I'm expected to attend church for both sunrise service and regular services, so I had to go again at 10am, which leaves not enough time for a decent nap.  I got an hour and a half of sleep, and three hours of church in one day.  I think that ratio is a little...what's the word I'm looking for...um...fucked up, I guess.  First of all, I don't do church because I'm not at all religous.  As in, I don't even believe in the whole deal.  I go to these things to sate my family, and because it spares me hours and hours of lectures.  In the midst of all of the cooking and cleaning and organizing, I got a phone call that made little-to-no sense to me.  I'd go into it, but some people who read this thing would make it into something much bigger than it probably is and I don't have the time or energy to defend myself against the ridiculous rumors that would inevitably spin out of it.  So, I'll leave you guessing, but it added a whole other level of angst to Easter that myself on less than two hours sleep should ever have to maintain my sanity through.    Rapid change of subject.  The weather has sucked the last few days.  Tomorrow it's supposed to be in the 70s.  Same for the day after.  Of course, we can't have nice temperatures without hurricane force winds.  I hate the weather.  I think that's just going to be a recurring theme in my life.  Alright, I'm to the restart portion of my windows update, so I have to end it here, but you should know that I have a million and a half thoughts in my head that I could have forced upon you.  It must be your lucky day.  Now go play the lotto or something.

      Yep, it's been a good news kind of day, so here we go with all the developments...  I am going to live.  Yeah, I knew it, and you all knew it, but that doctor of mine likes to make us all think I'm going to die tomorrow from some horrific disease.  Catscan came back all clear (just like I told him it would).  Turns out that I was right with my initial diagnosis--my headaches are caused by my wonky jaw.  Now we just have to figure out how to un-wonk it.  My grandmother is also going to live.  The angiogram came back clear--no blockages.  Just as we all suspected.  Turns out, she's just old.  Whodathunk?  Oh, wait, all of us thought it.  Mr H's issues have been semi-dealt with and now he's going to be home the week originally planned.  For those of you uninformed, he was contemplating an early return because everything around him just started to suck greatly.  A translator and a sit-down with the head honcho cleared things up (just as I figured it would).  And he's got his place all to himself, so in actuality, things are better than they once were.  His roommate was a dope.  More Mr H news.  When he comes back, he's staying with his dad for a week and then spending the rest of May and part of June in the general vacinity of me.  We're not sure where, yet, but I hear the new hotel a few towns over have long-term rates, so my guess is he'll be there.  My contract just got renewed for next year (full year, none of this semester-to-semester mess) and I am on board with the volleyball team.  Oh, and I got a raise starting in August, so that's a plus (the more money I make, the faster I can get the hell out of the parent's house--well, so long as I can find a respectable place to live, and considering the options available right now, I'll put up with my mother).  I also was asked to coach summer softball, which I turned down.  Why turn it down, you ask?  Well, mostly because I may have played the game, but I don't know a thing about coaching it.  And you know me.  If I can't be good at it, I don't want anything to do with it.  I actually plan on checking into the management job for the swimming pool.  Or, I could just sit at home all summer and not work.  And quite frankly, I kind of like that idea, especially with Mr H back in the country.  It'd be nice to have three months to go off and do whatever I'd like.  Spend a few weeks here, a few weeks back in Waterloo, a few weeks in Minneapolis, a few weeks wherever Mr H ends up after he leaves here.  The more I think about it, the better it sounds.  And now it's time for me to make some supper.  First time in a while I've been home at this time of day during the week, and it's only fair that I cook for everyone, right?  Yeah, it's not, but that's okay because I think both mom and dad have meetings soon anyway, so it'll be supper for one.

      Okay, so last week (maybe the week before) I mentioned that my grandma was going to see a cardiologist.  She went.  She has an angiogram scheduled for Wednesday.  If there is blockage, she'll have another procedure the same day to clear the blockage.    And then this past Friday, I hit up the doctor myself because I've had ridiculous headaches lately.  Not gradual headaches, per usual, but rather non-stop, sleeping and awake, throbbing headaches.  Not migranes, but headaches.  I've had a migrane before, and this is not dis-similar from it, however, this is at the base of my neck up to my right ear and just messes with me all day long, every day of the week.  My personal diagnosis is that I've started grinding my teeth and that has my wonky jaw (we all remember the face-plant, don't we?  It's been weird ever since) even more wonky than it once was.    So, my brand new, prone to overreaction doctor has me scheduled for a catscan on Tuesday.  Because, you know, it could be a brain tumor.  It's SO not a brain tumor.  He is certain it's not my jaw (I'm still not so certain).  There are three things I believe it could be, if it's not my jaw.  1) My eyesight has finally decided to suck just like it's genetically required to do (I am the only family member in my immediate and extended family that does not wear any kind of glasses--reading or otherwise), 2) my spine is rediculously out of alignment because my bed is shit and causes me to sleep as one would sleep if she were sleeping on a cement block, or 3) a pinched nerve in my neck caused by the whack I took in an after-school pickup game of one-on-one with the men's basketball coach last week.  Seriously.  It's not a brain tumor.  I need a new doctor, because this one likes to call for tests that are not necessary.  And I have to pay for them.  My insurance company probably hates me (and on some level, him).  Either that or they see me as some sort of cash cow.  I think doctors see dollar signs when I walk into their office.  All they have to do is look at my chart.  Christ.  Sometimes I think I spend more of my free time in a doctor's waiting room than I actually spend doing anything else.  Stupid overreacting doctors.  Here are the things he's had "checked" since I started seeing him in January: I had an MRI on my foot (necessary), he scheduled an MRI on my right knee because it didn't move properly (unnecessary--knees without cartiledge and with prosthetic kneecaps tend to move differently from regular knees), he ordered an xray on my right ankle because there was a protrusion he was concerned about (unnecessary--it's scar tissue surrounding the pins), he ordered a biopsy on a mole on the back of my neck (unnecessary--it's been checked every year since I was 8, it hasn't changed color or shape since then), he put me on antibiotics for the red bumps on the back of my arm (unnecessary--it's genetic and it doesn't bother me, nor is it anything to be concerned about because numerous skin-doctors have said so), he did a blood test for diabetes (unnecessary--I came into the office one day and was rediculously thirsty, and had a wierd crack in the skin on my foot, and since my mother is diabetic, he figured that was why--I had eaten some salty soup for lunch, and my feet are always fucked up [you run 15 miles/day and see how your feet look]).  I don't fault him for being thorough, and I am happy that he's actually concerned about things, and that he knows my family history and all that.  He's my whole family's doctor (from my 80-year-old grandparents right down to my cousin's 3-year-old daughter), so he knows all the dirty little medical secrets that roam through my family's blood lines.  You name it, someone in my family probably has it (whether they know it or not).    BUT, as has been my legacy, I don't have any of the serious genetic malfunctions that my family has.  My mother got most of them.  My father has his share for his side of the family.  My brother has his share (and mine, probably).  I'm your injury specialist.  If it's been broken, sprained, reconstructed, repaired, or put together with a popsicle stick and twine, I'm your girl.  Test my blood all you like, I can assure you that it's all good.  The only thing you have a snowball's chance in hell of finding on a blood test is that my iron is higher than it should be.  If anybody can figure out why that is, that would be fabulous.  It's been like that since I hit puberty.  No one knows why.  But that's the only thing anyone ever finds when they stick that little needle in my arm.  So, on Tuesday, I get to have a catscan.  So the doctor can "know for sure" that it's not a brain tumor.  Silly little monkey.  One of the many tests I've had before.  It came back clear that time, and it will this time.  Normally, I'm a worrier, but this time, I'm not worried in the least.  Seriously, I'm not even joking.  I'm not even remotely worried.  I hope this guy enjoys me paying off his med-school loans.

      Okay, I'm better now.  Does anyone else have ridiculous weeks like that?  Where no matter what they do or what happens, they just feel shitty?  If you don't, let me be the one to tell you that they suck giant donkey balls!  This weekend is going to be el weekend de relaxation.  Hopefully.  I'm already seeing my mother circling trying to make it as un-relaxing as possible, so we'll see how that turns out.  Has anyone out there ever lived in a house where no matter how many times you remind someone of something, they just don't do what they're supposed to do?  I do.  As I left for work every morning this week, I remind mom to go to the store and buy some toilet paper because we're almost out.  I'd do it myself, but the store here opens at 8 and I'm already gone by then, and it closes at 8, and I haven't been home by 8 in the last three weeks.  And there is no store between here and work (sad to say, this town is larger than the two I have to drive through.  Combined).  So, here I sit on Saturday morning waiting for someone (mom) to go buy some damned toilet paper.  We're completely out.  Three bathrooms and not a ply anywhere.  Nothing.  Nadda.  Zip.  Zilch. Zero.  Her excuse for this?  "I refuse to pay an extra $2 for toilet paper in the grocery store!"  Okay, that might seem like a fine idea to anyone who's never been here, but that store is the only store in town, and the only one you'll find for 30 miles (20 if you're in search of a convenience store, but that's north and nobody ever goes north unless they're going to Minnesota, and once you get past that convenience store, you have another 75 miles to go to find anything).  So, here we sit on Saturday morning without toilet paper, because mom hadn't found a "good" reason all week to go to the town 30 miles over, and so hasn't bothered to replenish the TP supply.    I  made  her go this morning after I ran the three miles to my grandparents house to use their toilet paper and then ran back.  The grandparents weren't up yet, so I scared the hell out of them by letting myself in.  Grandpa came downstairs with a tennis racket, just like a grandpa in a cartoon would.  But I will say, that was the best on-the-fly breakfast I've had in years.  Three hours later, mom is still in search of toilet paper and I'm contemplating another run.  At least I'll get dinner in between.  And really, isn't it all about the food?

      Alright kids, I'm putting out an apology before I offend, hurt, bitch at, hit, scream at, hang up on, or do anything else to you that might be seen as irrational and/or erratic behavior.  I'm having a shitty week.  Shitty in the sense that I just feel like the pot is boiling over because it hasn't in a while.  And because I have been missing Ryan more this week than I have in a long while, and it's killing me.  Slowly, and surely, it's killing me.  Yes, that sounds overly-dramatic, but it's how I feel right now.  He's not around to talk to like I used to, which is why these things are building up that I just don't know what to do about, or who to talk to about them and he's the only one who ever truly understood any of it.    And also because something happened to someone I've never met (nor spoken to) that is eerily similar to something that happened to me.  Even more eerie is the fact that if you put us side-by-side and colored my hair a shade darker, she'd be looking a whole damn lot like me.  So much like me that I had a friend who now lives on the west coast call my house to see if my family was okay because he saw "my" picture on TV.  The sound of gasping was heard when I answered the phone since he was fully expecting me to not be here.  He just caught the tail end of the story and missed the name of the girl and just assumed it was me.  It wasn't.  Not this time, anyway.  Six years ago it was, though.  Six years ago on Monday.  The same day he called.  I'd have to say that this week is about as close to a panic attack as I will ever get.  Of course, no one looking at me knows it, because I'm really goddamned good at covering that look up (years of experience with that will help), but seriously, things are very unsettled.  When nobody's been looking, I've been sobbing to myself in private.  Some things are so ridiculously...well...ridiculous that I can't keep up with all the things that are not quite right, but not really wrong, either.  It's not something new that I'm always looking over my shoulder (damn if that news story didn't freak me out a bit--like I said, it's just too similar for it not to freak me out), and it's not something new for me to walk around afraid that when I let my guard down something bad will happen.  I'm used to all that.  What I'm not used to is having no one here to mop up the mess I leave when I inevitably lose my mind.  As stupid as it sounds, that's probably what's freaking me out the most.  At the moment, there is no buffer between me and the world, and that's probably the scariest thing of all.  To me anyway.  To anyone else, it probably isn't something that ever crosses their mind.  It shouldn't cross mine.  But it does.  All the time.  It's sick, but I'm one of those people who need someone in their life all the time that can take their abuse and come back with some sort of compassion and understanding.  Yeah, Mr H is in my life, and he is that kind of guy.  He's wonderful.  But he's not here.  There's only so much he can do over the phone.  And that's a two-way thing.  He's having some trouble in Italy, too and there's only so much I can convey over the phone that is at all comforting.  He's miserable at the moment.  Absolutely miserable.  He wants to come home right now and can't because of his contract.  And I can't go visit him because I can't take the time off from work.  All the shit that is happening to him is enough to deal with without my adding all the shit that I go through on a regular basis, so when I do vent to him, I feel like I'm just adding to the pile of problems he has.  He says I'm not, but I know better.  UGH!  When is life going to get easier?  When?  Someone answer me, please!

      I've been called stubborn, hard-headed, excitable, bitchy, evil, and a host of other adjectives, but today I heard one that makes absolutely no sense.  My mother called me fickle.  Fickle.  Maybe my understanding of the word is skewed, so let's just go look it up.  The Webster's Dictionary tells me that it means inconstant or deceitful.  Ummm...perhaps my vision of myself is a bit skewed, but I'm the most brutally honest, consistent person I know.  Her reason for calling me this?  Because she thinks I change my mind a lot.  I don't change my mind a lot.  Once my mind is made up, that's it.  No changes.  Which is why hard-headed is an adjective that suits me so well.  Not that it's always a good thing, but seriously, it's just how I am.  The instance for which she felt "fickle" would be the appropriate backhanded comment to flick at me?  While watching a soap opera this afternoon (one which I haven't seen since last year--Guiding Light for those of you wondering), I commented on how I hated the coupling of one particular super-couple (Cassie and Edmund).  They don't fit, and she has much better on-screen chemistry with another guy in the cast (Danny).  She, feeling that my comment was somehow inconstant, called me fickle.  I've been bitching about the coupling since they put the two people together.  And bitching even moreso when the Cassie/Danny coupling seemed such an easy transition to make a couple of years ago.  So, even if I am fickle (I still don't buy it), this was certainly not the time or place to throw it out there.    I think my mom needs a dictionary for Christmas next year.  So, Memorial Day weekend was eventful.  Mr H and I went up to Minneapolis to help Jamie and Will (both) pack so they can move tomorrow.  We managed to get some tickets to the Timberwolves/Lakers Game 5 (from an unlikely source, which I will not disclose should I ever need another big favor).  Excellent seats, even.  I got MVP (Kevin Garnett for those of you not into the NBA--I used to be among you) sweat on me during more than one occasion, even.  That's how close we were.  And we were about six seats down from a Kobe sized shoe in the face, which was good, because I don't think I'd like a shoe to the face.  Oh, and the game.  The game was great.  NBA games are SO not the same on television.  Having never been to one in person, I was a lot less interested in them prior to my close-enough-to-view-the-woodgrain-on-the-floor seats.  I'm so interested, in fact, that there is a potential that I'll opt-in on TWolves season tickets, should the offer be extended to me again.  I opted out two years ago, and now I regret it.  Oh, and by the way?  The Lakers are the biggest bunch of fucking whiners I've ever seen.  They get paid like a billion damned dollars and all they can do is bitch to the referees when the correct calls are made?  Grow up.  Mark Madsen was tossed to the ground more times than I can count and never bitched that he was being fouled.  Even when the officials were calling him for those fouls.  Shaq may be big, but that doesn't give him the right to toss the other guys around like ragdolls.  Oh, and how about a little less preferential treatment for the LA team and a little more fair treatment for the fucking MVP?  Karl Malone was draped all over him like a wet blanket all night and only had like two fouls.  That, my friend, is bullshit.  And it's even more bullshit that the officiating won the series for the Lakers in Game 6 tonight.  But that's another rant for another day.  We couldn't get in to see Jamie and Will's new apartment because the old tenants hadn't moved out yet (sounds like they were going to do that today), but Jamie assures me that it's nicer than where she lives now.  I forced her to assure this to me because she's got a fucking great apartment right now.  HUGE and low rent for her particular suburb of Minneapolis.  And anything is a step up from where Will lives.  Good lord.  He lives in the basement of a three bedroom house with three other guys, who from all accounts, have never heard, nor seen, bleach or a sponge in their entire lives, let alone a vacuum cleaner.  Grossness.  But the new apartment allows pets, and Will has an adorable puppy, so they needed to move, I guess.  So, what else?  Oh, the basement is finally completely dry.  Now I just have to get a cleaning company in here to clean my couch.  I love my couch and the kind of fabric on it may have spared it from complete and total destruction.  I'm not sure what the fabric is, but it's shiny and cool and mustard yellow.  Okay, so it's not a pretty couch, but it's the most comfortable couch ever and I could never ever part with it.  Even if the insurance adjuster tells me I can buy a new one.  I will finally be getting some money to buy a new armoire instead of the rickety old chest of drawers I once had.  The one that I've had to nail the side back on not once, not twice, not even three times.  Four times I've had to rebuild that damned thing.  And now it smells so godawful that I MUST replace it.  Oh, and contrary to prior reports, my old apartment building is actually still standing.  The roof on the opposite side of the building caved in or sagged in or something--all the apartments except mine had a leaky roof, so that wasn't unexpected.  But it is still in tact and livable.  Jake, apparently, needs to have his eyes checked.  Mr. H got a tryout call-up on Saturday.  He's stoked.  But that means he'll be going to Iowa City, Kalamazoo or Madison in two weeks (he'll decide soon--it depends on a myriad of criterion--essentially which one will offer him the kind of support he needs to get prepared for the tryout call-up).  Some of you are now completely confused, and I like it that way, so I'll leave it that way just for you.  Anyway, it'll be back to long-distance again.  And we all know how much I love that.  Unless I decide to go with him.  We'll see.  Anything else?  Ummm...no, I think that's it for now.

      Seriously.  One more drop of rain and I may just traverse that short little path to asylum-bound crazy.  Last night I was nearly asleep in the most comfortable bed on the planet (read: not mine) and I hear this crash of thunder followed by this flash of lightning and the inevitable pitter patter of little rain drops.  Followed soon thereafter with the plunkity plunk of bigger rain drops.  And right behind that was the tinkity tink of hail stones.  I?  Was a half hour from home.  Home where nearly all of my belongings are walking that fine line between trash and salvageable.  Someone spilling their water on the sidewalk makes me spaz out.  Because I'm fairly certain that all gutters and sidewalk cracks lead to my basement with all my stuff in it.  Now, I really wasn't aware just how much I value all of my stuff.  There've been times when I think lighting a match and dousing the place with lighter fluid isn't a completely bad idea.  But I do value everything I have.  From the shitty Sheryl Crow CD to the paintings (that really only have sentimental value).  It's all mine.  I bought it or was gifted it.  And I'd like to be the one to decide when it's time has come to meet the bottom of the dumpster.  Faulty drainage shouldn't get to decide that.  So what did I do when I heard the rain last night?  I took my pajama-clad ass out the door, in the car, and motored it back here so I could sit on the basement stairs and stare at the floor just waiting for the seepage.  What would I do when it came?  I have no idea, but I suspect I would have gathered the most precious things (which I've already had cleaned twice this week) and start moving them to higher ground (read: my car).  Putting them in the car makes the car undrivable, so I can't actually store them there long-term.  And there is no place else for them to go.  So, no, I haven't slept since Tuesday night.  And the rain?  Supposed to start again tonight.  I have a pot of coffee all ready to start brewing.  It's supposed to keep this up all weekend again.  The good news is that the sewers are working now, so at least we don't have that to deal with anymore.  The really good news is that I got a lead on a house to rent here in town, but it's totally on the downlow.  It's not listed and it's supposed to be sold, but the sellers are useless windbag idiots who think they're going to find a buyer willing to pay what they are asking.  FYI: You could sell the whole town and everyone in it for what these people want for the house.  If, in the next two weeks, the seller doesn't lower the price and/or get an offer, it's going up for rent.  And rent is going to be extraordinarily low.  Like chump-change low.  The best part of this is that the basement doesn't leak.  At all.  And there have been few, if any, problems in the recent past, so my belongings would get a major reprieve from the flooding.  Oh, and the other best part about this would be that I wouldn't live at my parent's house anymore.  How fucking great will that be?!  Oh, and Jamie is officially doing some shacking up.  She and Will have decided to live together and have found an apartment in Eagan.  I think she just likes moving a lot.  From one side of Minneapolis to the other.  I think she gets a kick out of it.  And I think she likes making us all help her pack.  And then figure out how to transport all her stuff in three cars.  Anyway, if any of you were left off the mass email she sent out with her address and, most importantly, new phone number, let me know and I'll get it to you ASAP.  Can I just mention how friggin' cute Jamie and Will are?  Absofuckinglutely adorable.  At the risk of sounding cheesy (don't I always), they're going to have cute, albeit devilish, redheaded children someday.  Many of them.  And they're all going to be insane.  It's not possible that they won't be.  Bunches and bunches of little devil children.  And I, as their enabling auntie (no, not literally), will spoil them completely rotten.  And then send them home all wound up on sugar and caffeine.

      ...I'm begging, now.  Just stop.  All of my stuff in both my basement and my grandparents' basement is floating.  It's time for it to stop.  It rained over 4 inches on Friday.  It rained 3 more yesterday.  But hey, at least there hasn't been a tornado here.  Yet.  An entire town about 40 minutes south of here was obliterated by a tornado on Friday night.  The small town of Bradgate, IA, with just over 100 residents has about 50 homes.  All but three of them were either heavily damaged (ie. no roof, a wall missing) or completely destroyed (ie. picked up and tossed on the neighbor's house).  This was about five miles to the north of where the wedding I had to attend was located.  I had to drive almost through Bradgate (I say almost, because they won't let you drive through--you have to go around via gravel roads, which are mostly washed out) to get back home, and from what you could see a mile away, it's pretty much flattened, aside from the grain elevator and a few trees.  We're expecting more of the same both tonight and tomorrow.  I just hope the expected rain isn't too much and that we don't have to evacuate.  But the house is currently on lake-front property.  You all noted the sarcasm there, right?  I hear it's worse in Waterloo and that my old apartment building has collapsed in on itself because of the water and the current from the Cedar River.  So it really could have been worse.  I guess it's okay that they ripped me off with my security deposit.  Okay, it's not, but now I'm not going to pitch a fit to them about it.  Carpet cleaning, my ass.  I moved in with cat and dog shit on the floor, and they tell me they're charging me for carpet cleaning.  Bastards.  Last night was Des Moines' turn for the severe weather, so we've spent the better part of the morning trying to get ahold of my brother and sister-in-law and finally reached them.  They had to head north to find a phone that worked because their phone lines are all screwed up and the electricity in their building has not yet been turned back on.  Sounds like the flooding down there is bad and expected to get worse.  I would assume so, since all but two rivers in this state run through Des Moines, and they're all out of their banks.  Agh.  It's starting to rain again.  I have to go help with the sandbagging effort around the lift station so we don't end up with sewage in our houses.  I'll try to keep you all updated, but I'm shutting off the machine again.  I don't need it to get zapped by lightning.  And with our weather luck lately, I'm not going to push it.

      Okay, I rarely bitch about my dad on here--I reserve most bitching for my mother and my life.  Today, however, my dad is severely pushing his luck.  Okay, it started yesterday, but it's carrying over to today.  He walked up to me after I got home from work yesterday and told me I had to get a job this summer if I expected to remain living here.  Okay, fine, whatever.  That doesn't bother me.  But then he shoves the classifieds at me, which contain numerous jobs that are more than an hour commute from here.  And then he demands that I apply for all of them while he's sitting there watching me do it.  Now, those of you who know my father know that when he says something (which is rare--he doesn't talk to me or anyone else), you just as well do it or your life will become hell in short order.  Mr H was standing there when he handed me the classifieds, and was assuming it was a joke.  Poor poor Mr H.  My dad doesn't joke.  About anything.  Ever.  So now Mr H is getting the evil eye (and squirming under it) while witnessing me "do what I'm told" (which you all know that I never do) and not even complain about it.  So he's confused AND uncomfortable.  And then dad takes up a seat right next to Mr H while I'm crafting some damned resumes and cover letters to send out to companies at which I have no intention of working.  Now, lucky for me, dad doesn't know a good resume or cover letter from a bad one, not to mention he doesn't even understand the concept of a resume, because this man has literally been handed every job he's ever had.  He has a college education, but he's never ever worked in the actual field in which he studied (agricultural science for those of you interested).  He doesn't understand the job-search process.  But, back to the original story where dad throws me into a rage and Mr H doesn't know what to do because he has never seen this rage thing before (lucky for him, he lived in Italy for a while so he missed a few months of it).  Oh, and add to the mix that there is absolutely nothing I can do about the whole situation because my throwing a fit will get me nowhere, because my dad, quite literally, doesn't give a shit as long as he gets his way.  So I'm crafting bogus resumes and cover letters and dad is sitting glaring at Mr H and Mr H is squirming and trying to make small talk and joke around.  When I finally finished going through the entirety of the classifieds and printed up approximately 27 copies of the resume and a handful of the cover letters, dad hands me a stack of envelopes (already addressed in his chicken-scratch handwriting) and then I put the resumes and cover letters in the envelopes (thinking that I'd fake sending them this morning on my way to work).  I put the stack in my room near my bag to go in the morning.  WELL, somewhere between then and this morning, dad let himself into my room, took those envelopes, put stamps on them and mailed every single one of them.  So this morning, when I went to leave, the stack was gone, so I asked him about them and he said that when Mr H and I went out last night that he ran them up to the post office (where he works) and put them in the outgoing mailbox.  So now I have a good old stack of resumes floating around out there that have no business floating out there, not to mention that some of these jobs are jobs I'm not even qualified for (I can see the HR people at the hospital reading my resume and getting a good chuckle out of me thinking I'm qualified for an RN position).  The only saving grace with that is that I'm not  actually  interested in any of those jobs, but should I some day decide to switch careers (yet again) and need to apply to any of those companies, their first impression of me is going to be not so good.  So, not five minutes ago, I walked in the house and there is dad with  today's  classifieds from two more newspapers (none of which we subscribe to, so I have no idea where he got them).  So, right now he thinks I'm writing up resumes and cover letters for all of those jobs right now.  No.  No I'm not.  I'm not going to, either.  He's got to go away in an hour and I'm going to lie to him and tell him I mailed them already.  He is the mailman, I know, but from my limited knowledge of how things work in that office up there, he doesn't have a key for the outdoor drop box and therefore never sees what's in it.  But seriously, when did I return to being 16 years old and have him have to make my decisions for me.  If he wants me to pay rent, I can do that.  If he wants me to move out, I can certainly start looking for a place to live (I have been since I moved in, for christsake).  If he had some interpersonal skills and less of a temper, I think I could explain to him that I am almost 25 years old and it's really time to start treating me as such.  BUT, he's not the kind of dad you can sit down with and explain anything to him.  He doesn't listen because he doesn't care to.  So now if, god forbid, I actually get an interview for any of these jobs, dad will know about it (because, as mentioned previously, he is the mailman) and then no matter what I think of it, he'll make me go.  I could say no.  I could also dig my own grave and jump right in and then will the dirt to bury me alive.  Because both will heed the same results.  So then when the interview goes well (because it would be my luck that an interview I don't want to be at would go better than I ever wanted it to) and they offer me the job, I'll have to take it.  Because I won't have any say in the matter.  None at all.  Well, at least it's becoming more obvious to Mr H why I didn't want him living here.  Because my family is screwed up and he doesn't need to see all of it.  Nor should he want to.  He left last night with that deer in the headlights look, and I'm pretty certain I won't see him now until Sunday (or Saturday night if I can convince him to come to the wedding reception--he already nixed the wedding--with me).  He's now thoroughly afraid of my dad.  Which just makes my life  SO  much better.  Note the sarcasm.  Ugh.  I hate my family.  I really really do.  Oh, and my aunt?  Already giving me a ridiculously hard time about the possibility of being late for the wedding.  Because it's my fault that my cousin decided to get married in May when not only every high school in the free world is having graduation, but also the state track meet (which could have affected my other cousin who could have qualified had she not broken her toe).  Yeah.  That's my fault.  God I didn't miss this part of my family.  The part where anything and everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, and it is always my fault.  No matter what.  Fucking hell.  I'm going to the bar.

      This past Saturday, my girls had what I had figured to be the final meet of the season.  I was happy, seeing as it's my first year here and I really had no expectations going in that anyone would end up at state.  The state meet is this coming Friday and Saturday in Des Moines.  In some sort of last minute effort to extend the season, which I didn't see coming at all, not just one of the girls qualified.  THREE of them did.  The girl with the most potential on the team (also known as the head coach's daughter) showed up at this meet like I've never seen her show up before.  She won the 3000m, thus qualifying herself for the state meet.  Not only qualifying for it, but hitting one of the best times in the state this season.  Just as a quick explanation, in order to get to the state track meet here in Iowa, you have to compete in a regional qualifying meet and get first or second, or be one of the best eight times or distances following those qualifiers.  The rest of the season doesn't matter, aside from figuring out the lane and seeding assignments for the regional meet.  Anyway, perhaps the biggest surprise in any of this is that my 400m Hurdler qualified.  This regional meet was the first time she'd ever run the race, and only ran it because we decided to throw her in there to see what a decent hurdler could do when stretched to the limits.  And damn did she prove herself there.  She came in second, thus qualifying for the state meet and leaving me mightily worried that I might have to forego my cousin's wedding this Saturday and probably never hear the end of it for the rest of my natural life.  BUT, to nearly seal that deal, one of our 400m runners found herself qualified as well.  The only reason this surprises me is that some of the teams in our regional had previously (read: when I was in high school) been known as 400m schools--they always sent girls to state, and routinely made me push myself harder to qualify ahead of them.  Unfortunately (for them, I guess) they've dropped off as far as track and field goes, and this girl slid into the final qualifying time slot (she auto-qualified, but with the slowest time).  So now here's the problem.  The 3000m is on Friday night, so there's no issue there.  The 400m Hurdles is at 8:30 on Saturday morning.  Still no issue, because the wedding is at 4:00 and only an hour and a half away from Des Moines.  The 400m, however, is at 2:00 in the afternoon, with three heats, each spaced five minutes apart.  This puts the end of that event--at the earliest and if the meet remains on time, which never happens--at 2:20.  That gives me ten minutes to change and get to the parking lot (which, considering I will not be riding the team bus, will be somewhere an estimated six miles away--okay, I'm exaggerating, but it'll seem that far).  And then I have to maneuver from downtown (nearly) Des Moines to the north side to get the hell out of town.  Now, any of you who've been in or near Des Moines in recent months knows that this is not an easy feat, because it's gone mad-crazy with the road construction.  Pick a street, any street, and it's not open all the way through.  Not to mention the hell that is I-235, which is utterly ripped to shreds on weekends so they can blow up overpasses and try to rebuild them.  I've resigned myself that I'm most likely going to be late for the wedding.  Now, this may not actually be a problem, because this particular side of the family has a little issue with NEVER being on time for anything.  So, for once in my life I'm hopeful that this trend continues and the wedding starts about a half hour late.  Oh, and while I'm hoping for stuff, I hope it's not windy or rainy Saturday, because that'll just add to my frustration in getting changed and ready to go to a wedding from a track meet.  Oh, and if you happen to be cruising up 141 on Saturday 2:30 and 3:00, perhaps you might consider watching out for the woman flying down the road in an Escape while brushing her hair and probably applying lipgloss.  Because I won't be watching out for you.  This all would be solved if Mr H would agree to come to the wedding with me.  Stubborn man.  Oh, he's home now, by the way.  Like literally.  He's at my house right now.  Or he's supposed to be, anyway.  I should call and find out.

      Okay, here's a rant about my mother.  Those that choose not to read it, knock yourselves out.  Those that choose to read it, well, here it is.  She came home from work today early on account of the rain.  I came home from work earlier than usual on account of the same thing.  I came in the house and she was on the sofa in her bathrobe with a thermometer sticking out of her mouth, looking about as miserable as the weather was today.  So, I make the ominous mistake of asking her what's wrong.  Good lord.  She's got a fever of 102F.  She aches all over.  She's hot and cold all at the same time.  Okay, fine, I understand.  Not a problem with me at all.  She's sick.  I get it.  BUT, she made a sport of the remainder of the day telling both dad and I how cold she is.  And how hot she is.  And how she thinks she has a tickle in her throat.  And how she must be sick because she's drinking water like a camel.  All the while, she's actually feeling fine, aside from the hot and cold flashes and the hint of a tickle (which she's had for about a month because of her allergies).  So, tonight, I come up here to sit at the computer and in she walks.  So now I'm in a tiny space with this germ-breathing woman that will not shut up about how sick she is, nevermind she's not actually feeling any sort of sick feelings (aside from the tickle and the flashes), so she thinks this is perfectly acceptable behavior.  After about an hour of this, I finally snapped and told her to take her germy ass to bed and sleep the fever off.  Which, of course, was not met with the greatest reception.  To which I replied that if she ever wanted to get over whatever ook she's got, she's going to have to go to bed sometime, because wandering around talking about it isn't going to make it go away.  To which she had no response and then finally took her germs and went to bed.  Now, is it just me, or is there some common courtesy with other human beings that kind of instructs you to leave the healthy people alone while you're sick so as not to spread whatever you've got?  I know when I'm sick, I would just as soon no one even come in contact with me, because as irritable as I am healthy, I'm infinitely worse when I'm sick.  I get that she didn't feel sick.  I get that.  I do.  But if you have a fever, chances are really good that your body is fighting off something that I don't want.  Damn me and that damned common sense!  Oh, and by the way, the weather here (as mentioned previously) sucked donkey balls.  The electricity kept flickering all day long, rendering my day at school completely useless.  The team hit the weight room for about a half hour after school and then the power went out again, so we all just said 'fuck it' and left.  Stupid thunderstorms.

      I read an article in  urlLink Rolling Stone  yesterday, and it just added to my outrage over this country's administration, not to mention outrage over just how easily this administration is trying to make it for themselves to get re-elected.  The article is  urlLink Mock the Vote: College students are discouraged from voting by local election boards , and the title alone probably clues you into why it pissed me off.  I was a college student during the last election, and luckily, I lived off campus, so registering to vote was never a problem for me.  Some of my residence hall friends, on the other hand, got denied registration because the election boards don't recognize dormitories as places of residence.  Now, I'm no genius, but when someone spends time in a 12x12 non-descript box that doesn't have bars on the front of it for 8-9 months of the year, I'd say they live there.  It's their place of residence.  The IRS certainly thinks so, because that's the location for which you'll be paying taxes.  The US Postal Service thinks it is, because they'll send your mail to you at that location.  The United States Bureau of the Census (for which I used to work) agrees that it is, indeed, a permanent address if you choose it to be.  In fact, everyone except the local election board (and some of the more obnoxious residents of the community--any community with a college campus has these people) thinks you are an actual resident of the town in which you live (and spend exorbitant amounts of money).   "But in recent years, many election officials have been building a variety of hurdles to make it more difficult for students to register and vote. In May 2002, the city council in Saratoga Springs, New York, shut down a polling place at Skidmore College, forcing students to travel off-campus to vote. That same year, a judge in Arkansas tried to block 1,000 students at Ouachita Baptist University and Henderson State University from casting ballots, ruling that they must vote in their hometowns -- even though the deadline for absentee ballots had already passed. And when students from the University of New Hampshire showed up at the polls on Election Day that year, poll workers handed them a pamphlet warning them that voting locally could affect their financial aid and taxes. The scare tactic worked: Many students left without voting."   Registration to vote will not affect your financial aid or your taxes.  It's a lie that they'll tell you at the voting precinct to scare you off so they don't have to deal with you (who, all too often, they see as an inconvenience, because you take up space in their universe--except they fail to realize that their universe would not be as plush and cozy if you didn't exist, especially if the university population makes up at least half the population of the town in which it exists).  At the very least, at least where state-run universities are concerned, if you are from out of state and now register to vote in your current place of residence (where the university is located), you'll probably get instate tuition after six months.  Or not.  I don't know how in-state/out-of-state tuition works.  But most importantly, guess what.  It's illegal.  It was illegal four years ago, and it's illegal now.  It's illegal for an election board to refuse you the right to vote if you choose to vote in the precinct in which you live.  If this was any other administration that didn't involve George W. Bush and his numerous illegal acts and violations of American's simple rights (look at what he (and the FCC chairman) have done to freedom of expression), I may just look the other way at this story, but because of all the shady business going on, I feel like it's a fucking conspiracy.  Bush didn't win the election legally last time, either, but it didn't stop them from swearing him into office, now did it?  On another anti-Bush note, does anyone else ever remember a time where the President of the United States and pretty much everyone in his immediate cabinet were actually forced to testify in front of a Senate or Congressional subcommittee?  I don't.  Of course, I'm not that old.  But doesn't it signal to anyone else that this guy and all of his colleagues are doing something horribly wrong?  Iraq is a disaster, and I was one of his biggest supporters when I heard there were WMDs and Saddam was ready, willing and able to use them.  I think the number of soldiers killed in action is above 700 now, and all of it was for a vendetta the man has against a leader of a country that made an attempt on his father's life.  Oh, and oil.  He wants Iraq's oil.  So he can fuck with gas prices a little more.  Because paying $2.00 per gallon is just not enough for this president who has so many oil companies in his pocket that he looks like he might just shit oil.  I'm so incredibly sick of this president and his lies.  I understand the need to fudge the truth just a little bit, but blatant lies to the American people is downright unacceptable.  And here's where I show my democratic blood.  The republicans have gone on and on about how John Kerry flip flops on issues.  How he can only make a decision if he believes it's the popular opinion, nevermind what he originally felt was what he should do.  To me, and to anybody with a couple of brain cells rubbing together, this is what a leader should be.  Not so narrow minded that he can't see what isn't working.  And when it isn't working, he goes another direction.  George W Bush has yet to admit that anything he's done in the last 3 1/2 years has been a mistake.  GOOD leaders admit when they've done something that didn't work.  They admit when they've made a bad judgment call.  They admit when something that seemed so very right at the time actually turned out to be something that just flat out didn't pan out the way he'd hoped.  John Kerry admits it.  He admits it and he tries to fix the problem, even if he was a part of creating it.  He voted for the war, and then he voted in various ways to stop it.  He "flip-flops" on issues because they need to be flip-flopped on.  Don't forget that while George was lying to the American public, he was also lying to the members of the House and the Senate.  George can go ahead and blame the CIA for bad information, but I think it's become pretty clear that the person who messed this up was not a member of the Central Intelligence Agency.  The person who messed this up, and continues to mess this up, is the guy who refuses to admit that he acted on an agenda he has had since the early 1990s, when a guy named Saddam messed with a guy named Daddy.  Now, I don't love John Kerry as an alternative to George W Bush, but I will vote for him because I cannot fathom another four years of this man and his colleagues who, for all intents and purposes, have fucked us over from the beginning of their terms in office.  At least with Kerry we'll see a little more humility, tact, and, oh, I don't know, maybe he'll honor the United States Constitution.  George hasn't done a very good job of that lately.

      Looky, looky, friends.  Blogger got new templates.  I never really liked my old template anyway (we all remember that the reason the blog appeared the way it appeared was because I was busy trying to procrastinate while I should have been packing).  I said when it finally went live that I didn't love it and I'd change it to something better when I had more time(I don't completely love this one, but it's better).  Well, I've had lots and lots of time, but when I logged on to blogger this morning and found a completely new layout to the backend of the blog, I figured the least I could do is make a pretty new front end to it, as well.  Of course, I hit refresh and the May archive about 372 times over ten minutes because I was wondering why, exactly, the rest of the May entries weren't showing up, while April and the months prior were right there when I wanted them.  And then I looked at the date of the last entry and realized I'd only posted once this month.  So, I did a final publish of the template and went right in here (where, by the way, it's much easier to deal with, because it's much much prettier to look at) to make my second entry for the month.  I really don't have much to say today other than the View is probably the most annoying talk show on television.  I'm in the faculty lounge and that's what's on and I'm trying my best to ignore it.  The end of the track season (and the school year, for that matter) are rapidly approaching and I'm pretty excited about that.  Mostly because I'll have a lot of free time to do whatever I'd like.  At the moment, I'm not sure what that is, but I'll figure it out as the days go by.  Mr H got in early this morning.  His flight from Minneapolis was grounded a few hours because of the nasty weather they had up there, so he decided to wait for an early morning flight instead.  He said that aside from the bad weather in Minneapolis, the flights were really quite good.  Considering he flew Northwest into Minneapolis, that's actually saying something.  Northwest generally sucks pretty hardcore.  Anyway, I will see him next weekend for the first time since March, and I'm ridiculously excited.  Okay, maybe not ridiculously.  Just the right amount of excited, I guess.  Okay, I have to get out of this room, so I'm going to end this now (before I babble on for hours).  I cannot watch the View anymore.  It makes me want to kill the women.

        April 23   Nineteen years ago on that date, my sister passed away. This is the first year in the last seven that I've been home on that anniversary, and I commemorated it with a trip to her grave, where I placed nineteen lilies and five roses (a lily for every year she's been gone and a rose for every year she was alive).  I missed doing that the last few years.  I have done a make-shift version of it wherever I've been on that particular day on the anniversaries when I was unable to be here, but it's not the same.  I was sad to see that, while my family has assured me the opposite, none of them visit her grave on that day (or any other, from what I've seen).  My aunts assured me that on the anniversary of Lily's death, they'd make certain someone from every branch of the family tree would at least have flowers delivered to the grave site.  They lied, or they forgot, or they didn't care enough to tell me the truth, because I went to the site that night, and no one had been there.  Or if they had, they didn't leave any flowers or notes, or anything.  Maybe they've all just forgotten her.  I haven't, and never will.  Or maybe they're just doing something else to commemorate the day, but I really wish someone would clear that up for me.  Because, to me, it makes it look like they don't care.  Even if I know they do.    Sludge   Well, it's official now.  Half of my stuff that was stored on the floor in the basement is junk.  I said it would happen.  I pleaded with the parents to let me put another set of metal shelves down there to get my boxes off of the floor in the store room.  They turned me down.  And now half of my boxes, all of my rugs, the bottom dust ruffle on the sofa, and the desk are soggy because the sludge pump stopped working and sent sewer water throughout the basement.  Yes, for those of you curious, it did stink a bit, but luckily it happened while mom was doing laundry, so it was mostly laundry water.  At least the sofa has metal legs that keep it off the ground (they built 'em well back in 1952--the fabric didn't even absorb up from the ruffle), so that's pretty well in tact and safe.  The desk, on the other hand, was particle board with wood veneer (sp?) and is completely ruined.  The rugs are washable, and I hope after six or seven more washings, the smell will dissipate.  The stuff in the boxes, though, is junk now.  Boxes of books, notebooks, cooking utensils, and shoes.  I weep for the shoes.  Most of them were leather, and now are nasty looking, and therefore will be retired.  My grad plaques from the volleyball team and the track team were also in there and they're ruined.  I think my diploma was in there.  I know my cap and gown were, so I'm sure the diploma was near it.  A couple photo albums (including the entire wedding album for Ryan and Nikki--hopefully the other copy is safe and sound somewhere between those two families), and a box chock full of important papers should I ever be audited by the IRS.  So, yeah, I should have just stored them in the garage.  At least the garage doesn't have a sludge pump that might malfunction.    Gentle Cycle   So, that same day that the sludge pump went wonky, you'll recall that mom was doing laundry.  She threw not one, not two, but three of my shirts that go in the gentle cycle (but are supposed to be hand washed) in the regular cycle of the washing machine.  On hot.  And then she dried them.  Two of those shirts I'd only worn once, but the other was my absolute favorite shell tank.  It was a bargain basement purchase at TJ Maxx like three years ago, and I wore that shirt like once or twice every week, even in the winter (usually under a hoodie or under a jacket or under an oxford.  That shirt is now reduced to shreds and could maybe fit a second grader.  Eensie and unraveling.  Not cool.  I don't know why she tries to be helpful when it comes to my laundry.  She KNOWS that all it does is make me crazy mad.  I'm less than pleased with her right now.    Mr H   In much, much better news, Mr H will be home a week from tomorrow.  I won't see him that day, nor will I see him for the week after that, but two weeks from Sunday, he's coming up here to spend the remainder of the month, plus some, with me.  Once he gets here, he plans to stay in the extended stay hotel about a half hour south of here.  I couldn't be more excited, even if I won the lottery.  Good god I've missed him.  Some have asked about what I plan to do this summer, and at the moment, I have no idea.  First of all, I'm stoked to have summers off, and I can't for the life of me figure out why teachers bitch and moan about salary when they have a built in three months off, not to mention paid personal and sick days and full benefits.  I certainly will not.  Summer vacation rules, y'all.  Some of the plans I've tossed about include going wherever Mr H is going and keeping him company.  Picking up a managing gig with the local swimming pool.  Traveling the world (that's not happening).  Crashing on someone's couch in CF and partaking in all the summer debauchery that goes on around there.  Throw my ass into training and see if I can't snatch a spot on the Olympic team (not going to happen--I gave up my USA Track & Field membership, and all the random shit that goes along with it).  Seeing if I can't work my ass off somewhere and send myself and a group of my friends to Athens to watch the Olympics (where, if you read yesterday's entry, you should know is where I was supposed to be heading to get married--romantic thought, but I'm happy it didn't work out).  If you have some crazy suggestions for what to do with my summer, you should call or email me and let me know.  I'm up for almost anything, as long as I can afford it.

      Yeah, the lighthouse grew old.  And I didn't like the text formatting.  And the archive listing was annoying.  So I changed it again.  That?  Is all I have to say for now.  Write this down.  It's a historic moment.

      The meet was a success.  So was the after-meet stuff.  Which is why it's taking me a long while to type.  Mostly because my eyeballs burn from my allergies, but it's aided along by the drinks we drank to celebrate.  Yay spellcheck.   urlLink    I pulled this from the Courier.  Jake cleared 19 feet 1/4 inch and auto-qualified for the Olympic Trials.  And simultaneously jumped to #5 on the US vault rankings (at least that's the rumor).  Lucky move I made there this afternoon when I enabled email posts to the ole' blog.  Now I can harass the blog readers any time I'm anywhere near a computer.  Go me.

      I decided to change the look again.  Because I could.  I don't know if I like this as much as the last one, but we'll go with it for now.  It's ridiculously easy to change it, so it's not like it'll ever be permanent.  In other news, I'm going to Madison tomorrow.  All that shit I bitched about in my last entry is going to be taken care of.  I hope.  Today, however, I am going to CF.  Because there's an olympic trials qualifier at the home track and I need to see some of that.  I would love to be running in it, and could have been had I not relinquished my USATF membership.  But I didn't need the hassle of random testers and the mess that goes with them.  Not that I'm on anything illegal, but I don't want to sit down after popping an alergy pill and have that damned tester come knocking on my door only to find out a month later that I am now serving a 2 year suspension.  Not that it would matter, but you know, I'd like to keep my name off any black list if I can.  Another reason I'm going is because Jake is trying his damndest to get qualified for the trials (he finished 9th 4 years ago) and if he makes it, I want to be there to see it.  And if he makes it, I'm sending my ass to Sacramento to see the Olympic Trials (well, if he or anyone else makes it--there are already two people qualified, so a third would make my track-obsessed self buy a ticket) in July.  I do so hope to see Sacramento this summer.  I will head to Madison from there in the morning.  It's on the way anyway.  Sort of.  In furniture related news, I'm getting a crap load more.  None of it comfortable.  Mom is down in Omaha helping my cousin and his new bride paint their house.  Well, I guess sometime they went to Nebraska Furniture Mart (probably the biggest furniture store I've ever been in) and she found an entire living room set for less than $1000, so she's buying it.  She's sending the old stuff with me.  So I guess my old living room furniture will be in the make-shift office.  Which isn't a bad thing, because if you remember, you know that the off-white and blue wing-back chair was what I used to use as a computer desk chair anyway, so it'll go back there and I won't be dealing with sparse seating where it matters.  I'm going to slip cover the sofas from here (and try to fix the love seat--it's one of those with two rocking recliners attached in the middle and it's been broken for years) in some fabric I haven't picked out yet.  And then I'm going to paint the end tables (they're a weird veneer look and they're not exactly attractive).  And I guess in the package with the furniture, they get an area rug, which Mom doesn't want or need, so I'm getting that, too.  Which is good, because the living room in my new place is hardwood and it needs a little soft cushiness under your feet.  Especially in the winter.  But now I need to go pack.  I don't know how long I'll be in Madison, but if I'm back on or before Monday, I think we can go ahead and assume it isn't good news.

      Just because I haven't in like a week, I figured I'd update.  I have very little to relay as far as information is concerned.  Nothing is happening.  Nothing.  Oh, well, I guess I maybe haven't posted this here, yet.  I'm moving at the end of the month.  I finally found somewhere that doesn't come complete with a set of parents you wish you didn't know most of the time.  It's a fabulous 4 bedroom house with a huge yard and lots and lots of space.  I have virtually nothing to put into it, but I guess I'll eventually pick random things up and fill that house with things I don't actually need.  Which is always a challenge for me.  Buying things I don't need (this does not apply to shoes) has always pained me.  I hear of people buying bookshelves and wall hangings and kitchy things, but I never have seen the need for any of it.  Sure it makes your home look good, but is it useful?  The bookshelves are, unless you're me and you have three sets of them that you've moved from place to place to place and have yet to find a valid use for most of the space they provide.  I don't have a lot of books.  I don't have any kitchy stuff (because kitch is just not my thing).  I find storing things like sweaters on shelves out in the open a bit annoying (why would I want them on display?).    This, of course, is where I seem to differ from everyone else on the planet.  I don't go off on a whim and buy things.  Everyone I know makes random purchases.  I bought a sweater today and it was a huge decision.  I could afford the $14 it cost, and it's cute and I have wanted this type of sweater for a long time.  But somewhere along the line, I became frugal.  No, not even somewhere along the line.  I remember when I started getting money from my grandfather (the one I never see) for my birthday and at Christmas.  It pained me to spend it.  I would search high and low for something so completely perfect to spend the money on that I rarely, if ever, found it.  I usually ended up putting it in my savings account and it would sit there until my brother went to college and I became his college fund.  Not voluntarily, mind you.  But then the bills come and I have very little trouble parting with my money in that manner.  Because I guess electricity, water, rent, etc. is all necessary, so I have no problem with that.  I have this car I've been thinking about trading, too.  Not because I don't like it, but because I know the sooner I trade up, the more the trade-in value will be worth.  But then it comes down to whether or not I  need  a new car.  I don't.  Mine works just fine.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  It's served me well.  I haven't been in an accident with it (yet), and the only thing decreasing its value right now is the hail damage (which is going to be fixed as soon as I get around to it).  But I've been thinking that the newer model (which is a hybrid now) would be more cost effective.  But there's nothing wrong with what I have.  And what I have is paid off (that's a long story, but essentially, I only had to make two semi-large payments on it) and that would be another expense to add on.  It's not like I'm poor, and I could certainly afford to buy a new car.  But I still live like I make $3.50 an hour and every little cent made a huge difference to the sixteen year old who got those paychecks.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll just wait around for people to feel like discarding their stuff before I fill my house with things.  That's where most of the furniture I have came from.  But some days I think it'd be really cool to pick out my very own brand new sofa.  Or my very own brand new bedroom set.  Or my very own brand new non-plywood dining room table with matching chairs.  And then I remember that those things cost a lot of money.  And I will, probably forever be cheap.  I am so my father's daughter.  And that pains me greatly, because he's a grade A asshole.  So what's going on today?  Absolutely nothing.  I think I might take the tent in the garage and go camping this weekend.  By myself.  Because that sounds like fun, I guess?  I don't know.  I'm just bored.  **Sorry, Mr. H, you're about to be drug through the mud.**  Why am I bored?  Well, because I had this whole fantasy of a summer break that won't be happening.  I still get all the time off, but absolutely none of the fun I had planned to go with it.  Mr H is no longer.  Permanently?  I don't know.  It's up to me.  So what happened to my happy little life?  Well, Mr H dropped the one bombshell he should have kept to himself.  While in Italy?  He had a girl on the side.  We had discussed before he left whether or not we'd be exclusive, and due to some strange circumstances, we never actually landed on a definitive answer.  The subject never came up while he was gone, and he just assumed it was okay with me.  I, however, was not okay with it, because I sat around and waited for him to come back.  I had opportunities to jump into the dating game while he was gone, and I declined because I "knew" he wasn't seeing anyone else and if exclusive is what we were, then exclusive is what I was going to remain.  Only he wasn't.  And I didn't know.  And he didn't mention it at the time.  And then he came back and everything was fabulous (or as close as it ever gets).  And then I get a phone call from a girl named Michele looking for him, and this number (my cell phone number) was the number he had phoned the most while overseas (apparently she lifted the number from a phone bill he'd left somewhere?  I really don't know).  She is apparently a girl that was studying abroad or traveling from the US or whatever she was doing, because she is most certainly an American and she is most certainly back in the States and looking for him.  I know this because the number that showed up on my cell was carrying an area code from somewhere in Indiana.  Where he is originally from.  Which doesn't sit well with me.  At all.  So she called and I handed my phone to him, not quite thinking anything of it (actually I thought it was his sister until he started talking to her).  She must have asked who I was and he told her and she flipped her damned lid.  She laid into him loudly (I could hear the conversation from the other side of the room).  So, of course, she didn't know about me, either.  That also doesn't sit so well with me.  I was not even mentioned to this girl.  At all.  Not even when he came back to the states and stayed an extra few days.  She didn't question that?  But then again, I didn't question when his moving date changed every two days, either, so go figure.  So now he's off the phone and about as red as red gets, because now he knows he has to tell me who that was.  I don't know how guilty he was feeling, because I didn't ask, but he told me the whole story, and I sat there and listened to it wondering when would be the best moment to throw him out of my house.  And then he continued explaining and I started to realize that whether I like it or not, I'm partly at fault for not being crystal clear in my expectations (which may not sound logical to a lot of you, but it really does make sense where it needs to).  But the thing that irks me the most about all of this is that it could have been prevented.  I could have called him to finish that goddamned conversation (that ended with both of us completely undecided on the matter--well, not completely undecided, but still negotiating what was fair) and it all would have been cleared up.  Then at least I'd know whether to be mad at him for screwing some other girl or be mad at myself for not telling him not to screw some other girl.  Oh, and I might be a little less angry if it had been more than one girl instead of making me crazy by cavorting with just one girl.  Because one girl = serious and multiple girls = slutting around Italy.  I think I could deal better with slutting around Italy.  So the explaining ends, and I send him away and tell him that I'll talk to him when I'm less angry.  He left.  This was two weeks ago.  I still haven't talked to him.  Because I'm still angry.  And I'm afraid that if I talk to him right now I'll say a lot of things I don't mean, and I'm really trying to stop doing that.  And what's really stupid is that I'm actually more afraid that he'll be ready to end it when I do decide I've subsided the anger long enough to talk to him.  Which totally sucks.  Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.  Sometimes I have to bitch somewhere where nobody is standing there looking at me like I'm an idiot because they just don't really get it.  See, I think you all see the pattern here when I have nothing to say.  I say a crap load of randomness.

      Okay, so last night I did something that is completely out of character for me.  I went to hang out with a girl I knew in high school.  One who I didn't like.  And still don't like.  Not because she's evil or anything like that.  No, she is the leader of the churchy crew.  I call her the churchinator.  She?  Bugs the living hell out of me.  Which, I suppose, is what her intent is.  Why did I do that, you ask?  Well, because I knew for certain that her house would be the absolute last place anyone would come calling for me.  I've been not answering the phone all week, throwing people on ignore when I'm online, putting my status on "away" whenever I don't want to talk to certain people.  I'm in full-on avoidance.  So let's get into the less lame than anticipated details from the evening, shall we?  We shall.  I showed up late (because that's what I do when I'm not at all thrilled with the people I'll be meeting up with) and was immediately cornered by another friend from high school who was absolutely shocked that I showed up.  SHOCKED!  Because I'd blown off the last dozen or so attempts from the churchinator to get together with me.  Because for the most part, she's really trying her hardest to never leave the memories of junior high and high school behind her.  Oh, and because at random moments in the evening, she'll quote and analyze Bible verses.  SO not my idea of relaxing or fun or entertainment.  This time, however the churchy crew blew her off.  Which means that she's not only annoyed the non-christians of the world, she's started annoying her own.  That's just how annoying this girl is.  I've known this girl for over fifteen years, and I have NEVER seen her pissed off.  Never, at least, until last night.  She was throwing a birthday party for a guy she had a HUGE crush on in high school and he blew her off to go fishing.  This is the standard operating procedure for her.  She throws lame birthday parties for all the guys she's ever liked.  She had one for Ryan three years in a row.  And we never showed up.  Because her parties?  Are generally lame.  Cupcakes and lemonade.  I shit you not.  At 24, you'd think she'd have graduated from cupcakes (with Happy Birthday spelled out on them) and lemonade to something a little less 7th grade.  She hasn't.  She doesn't drink, which is fine.  But she judges those that do, and judges loudly and often and to whoever will listen.  She's got issues with tattoos and has lectured me time and time again (every time I show up with one showing).  She's not terribly fond of extra piercings, and if she knew I had some, she'd lecture me on that, too.  She?  Is an 85 year old woman in a 24 year old's body with 12 year old tendencies.  So, back to the story.  The evening started off with everyone but me riding go carts.  I was never entertained by this, not even when I was in junior high.  No thanks.  I have enough trouble with people in cars driving me off the road, I don't need seventh graders in go carts doing the same thing.  After two hours of that (where I was entertained by my friend's 8 1/2 month old daughter), it was time for food.  The food was good.  Who doesn't like walking tacos?  I know I do.  I could have used something a little stronger than lemonade with kool aid in it, but with this non-drinking girl, that's the strongest drink you're going to get.  After that, it's time for ping pong.  I suck at ping pong.  I hit the ball too hard all the time.  Imagine that.  Anyway, I was paired up with the churchinator's "friend," Anna, from Alaska (she's also a coach and also not terribly thrilled with the lack of maturity at this party--did I mention that it was attended by a couple of seventh graders?).  Friend is in quotes because you can tell immediately that this girl does not really like the churchinator but she was too nice to decline the offer to get out of Minneapolis for a few days, even if it meant checking her sanity at the state line.  Anyway, Anna and I paired up to play ping pong against the seventh graders.  We won.  Because seventh graders are spazes and spent more time hitting each other with their ping pong paddles than they did playing the game.  Well, in the middle of this game, I came in contact with a rotten board in the floor.  And by came in contact, I really mean I stepped right through it.  Because it's not a party until you put your foot through the floor.  It didn't hurt last night, but it's all bruised and swollen today.  The same foot that was swollen last week.  And it hurts.  It's stiff and sore.  Blech.  Stupid board.  The seventh graders wanted a rematch after being blown away at ping pong, so they chose fooseball.  I've never played fooseball.  Didn't matter, because Anna had and we won anyway.  This is good for the two most competitive people in the room to be paired up together.  Because if either of us had lost, we'd have probably gone apeshit.  At this point in the evening, I was debating heading home.  And then the two seventh graders begged to play Phase 10 and said they wouldn't play if I went home.  What is it with seventh grade girls taking a liking to me?  I don't get it.  But whatever.  I humored them and stayed to play.  I think maybe one of them got the idea that they'd wipe the floor with both Anna and myself.  Poor girls.  Usually, I suck at cards, but I won that, too.  Anna wasn't pleased with that, but we both couldn't win.  And it's better for everyone if I do.  Because I can be a sore loser.  Ask anybody.    She'll learn that at some point, because next time I go up to Minneapolis, I promised to call her so she can learn that we're all not country bumpkins down here.  Jamie and I will show her how to live it up the right way.  Because we're good at that.  Anna has earned herself a spot in my cell phone.  The cell phone is an exclusive club.  I'm picky with my limited phone book space.  And after you use up all the VIP numbers (work, home, old contacts with other jobs, etc) and the VIF numbers (Very Important Friends), there are very few left for frivolous use.  So I pick and choose wisely.  Anna made the cut.  I should make up an award or something for that.  It rarely happens anymore.  Anyway, after cards, we sat down to watch "Win a Date with Tad Hamilton," which I'd never seen, but everyone else had.  Cute movie.  Josh Duhmel is hot and I could watch him read the phone book without a second thought.  After the movie, I came home.  Because it was just me and the churchinator (Anna had gone to bed--smart girl), and I don't do one-on-one with the churchinator.  But now it's time for lunch and if I don't eat now, I'm going to gnaw off my arm.  Or maybe my leg.  This right one keeps having issues, so maybe I'll do that instead.  I'll let you know.

      How's that for a title?  Fits perfectly if you ask me, especially since I don't have one of those fancy live journal-related mood indicators.  Today?  Has sucked.  No, I take that back.  This morning didn't suck.  This morning was okay.  Since noon?  Sucked.  Why?  Because people are dumb.  Not just some people.  ALL people.  No exceptions, myself included.  The only thing that has a snowball's chance in hell of saving this day from going down as one of the most annoying in my almost twenty-five years of life is the fact that Bridget Jones' Diary is on tonight and I can sit down with a gallon of tequila and pretend to drown in it.  If you're looking for me, you'll find me passed out on the floor somewhere.

      Four inches of rain in less than an hour does not a happy pv make.  Especially when I'm the ONLY person home.  The back yard is a lake.  The basement is dry--for now.  Not that the sewer didn't TRY to back up into the basement yet again.  It tried and I got there first.  Just as it was starting to trickle up the storm drain, I outsmarted it with a piece of PVC pipe that dad fashioned to make certain excess sewer pressure didn't force it into our house.  It took me about ten minutes to find it, but damn it, it worked.  All of this and I had to unplug the sludge pump because it's electric and so it's the first thing that gets unplugged, followed closely by the washer, the dryer, the freezer and the heater.  I?  Am supposed to be getting ready to go to dinner this evening, and also drop off some crap for my mother.  And now I can't.  I am able to go get ready elsewhere and take things to where they need to be taken, but I now can't leave the house, because I'm on water-watch.  Mr. H and I outsmarted the weather in another way, too.  We moved my sofa (which was cleaned to near perfection last week) and other items that would get completely funked up if they remained in a potentially water-logged area up into the garage.  Because in the garage, at least they can quickly and easily be loaded into a truck and whisked off to safety.  I fucking hate the weather.  Mother nature can kiss my ass.  Shit, I think she heard me because the clouds are forming again and the rain is getting ready to fall yet again.  SON OF A BITCH!

      Alright, kids.  Google has afforded me three more invites to the wonderful world of gmail.  I already wasted one or two entries on all the wonderful amenities offered by gmail, so go read that again.  If you want it, it's first-come, first-serve.  So send me an email (at either yahoo or gmail) to get an invite from me.

      Okay, I have a randomly swollen foot.  As in I did nothing to it, it doesn't really hurt and it's swelled up so badly that it looks like a fake leg with a club attached to the end of it.  The swelling goes down when I elevate it and then my calf and knee region swell up.  This is a new development (as in late--2am--last night I looked down and saw this...thing.  I thought it was something else, for instance a randomly wadded up pair of sweatpants or a shirt or something, and when I realized it was attached to me, I got worried).  Not worried enough to call the doctor, but worried.  I've been icing it all day and trying to keep it semi-elevated (enough so that the swelling stays down but whatever the liquid is in there doesn't pool around my already screwy knee), but every time I get up to go do anything (as small as walk to the kitchen or to the bathroom) it swells right back up.  I think if it hurt I'd be more worried, but this just doesn't hurt at all, aside from the stretched skin feeling I get in my foot.  If anyone has any pseudo diagnoses, let me know.  If not and the swelling hasn't receded by Friday, I guess I'll go in and get it checked.  Oh, here's a brand new development (in the last 12 seconds, in fact).  The skin is red, white and purple splotched.  Hmm.  Maybe I'll go to the doctor sooner than Friday.  Maybe.  I hate going to the doctor.  Or maybe I'll just sit back, lift my foot and see what happens when it pools around my knee again.  Or maybe I'll just sit back and eat my swiss cake roll and drink my coffee and pretend it's not even there.  Hmm.

      You know what sucks giant bits of ass?  The fact that I just spent the last hour here writing up a bunch of stuff that was probably irrelevant to anything, but really just rambling and in one stupid blip by my computer it was completely wiped out.  In the former post there was info about my summer plans, my weekend, my good luck, and my new place.  I guess we'll all just have to sit on our hands and wait for the majority of that information because I no longer have enough time to finish a proper write-up and you all know that I don't like to not have a short novel in every post.  That camera that I was selling, by the way, did not meet reserve, so I relisted it.  Go find it.  And put in a bid.  I took off the reserve this time, but upped the starting price.  And I already have a bid, but it's not at all what I think the stuff is worth, so please go bid.  Or run up the price for me.  Or something.  Mama needs a new pair of shoes.  Or maybe not, but I want them real bad.

      Okay, I made my very first foray into the world of ebay.  I'm trying to sell  urlLink a very expensive camera  that I purchased while in college for a photography class.  I loved this camera very much and I think any of you would love it too.  I'm selling it because, well, I don't need it anymore and I'm trying to purge things I don't need.  Flooding will do that to you.  So will moving 398 times.  I haven't used it in about three years now, so it's time for it to go.  If I'm successful in selling this item, I'll think about selling more of my stuff.  Because I have a lot of stuff that didn't get ruined in the flood that I would have just as soon it had so I didn't have to move it again.  So, go bid on it or something.  Or tell your friends.  Or your relatives.  Or some sucker who signed up for Photo I next semester.

      So clearly I don't read enough.  At least not enough to make this list a lot darker than I thought it would be.  Or maybe I just never finish all the books I start.  Actually, most of those unfinished books were from a nazi lit professor in college who though any of us had time to read a novel every three days.  I got most of them started but then had to get back to the real world where I didn't have time to do anything.  He had good intentions (read: excellent taste in novels), but he needed a little refresher coarse on how many hours there were in the day.  Anyway, must go to the Library.  You see?  This is what happens when I have time off.  Be prepared for more lists.  Oh and for credit's sake, I got this from Mr H's blog.  And no, you can't have the link.  PS.  The unusual number of books about sex is in direct correlation to the number of books assigned by a lady who taught a class called Human Sexuality and Relationships.  Which my friends all thought would be a fun class to take.  Turns out it wasn't and I had to hear a lot about sex from someone I never ever hope to ever see have sex, and wasn't all too thrilled to hear her talk about it, either.

      Ah, I'm all in my new place.&nbsp; Though I am still waiting on the living room furniture.&nbsp; I think mom is going to end up canceling her order and getting the sofas somewhere else, because clearly NFW is both unable to read AND write.&nbsp; When she gets her stuff, I'll get mine.&nbsp; We did pick up the tables for their place yesterday at another store because they were on sale.   Speaking of yesterday, Mom and I went to Mason.&nbsp; She's been trying to take me out to dinner for my birthday since the day before (when I believe she forgot that I was not in the state--but judging by the messages left, she was completely unaware).&nbsp; So we went to lunch at Papas.&nbsp; Which is usually quite good.&nbsp; It's just a little hole-in-the-wall kind of sports bar with fabulous food.&nbsp; Except yesterday the food was not quite so fabulous.&nbsp; I ordered the seafood alfraedo.&nbsp; I should have known better, as I don't always enjoy alfraedo sauce, nor does it always enjoy me.&nbsp; This time, though, the sauce was not the problem.&nbsp; They use imitation crab meat in the sauce.&nbsp; Which I usually do not mind.&nbsp; Yesterday, it had the most bizarre texture and was far too sweet.&nbsp; Which is the reason I stopped eating it.&nbsp; But not after injesting a few pieces, thinking perhaps it was just that piece of meat that was not right.&nbsp; Needless to say that I spent the better portion of last evening barfing my guts out.&nbsp; Me and bad food do not mix.&nbsp; I've had food poisoning more times than I care to remember (I think most of us recall the clam chowder incident in college, don't we?&nbsp; I can't even look at the stuff anymore it was so bad).   The rest of the afternoon (prior to arriving home and feeling like my stomach was trying to scratch it's way out of my body) was spent shopping.&nbsp; We hit McGregors (where I saw a nightstand table that I would die for, but I can't justify spending $400 on a nightstand table) to pick up&nbsp;Mom's tables.&nbsp; They're black metal with various shades of gray and brown and black slate tile on top.&nbsp; They're cool.&nbsp; Then we went to Target.&nbsp; Where I helped mom pick out a new cordless phone (if you ever have to buy a new phone, DO NOT choose the V-Tech 2.4gH cordless with caller ID.&nbsp; It doesn't stay charged.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because when placed on the charger, it does not maintain contact with the charging nubs.&nbsp; It's junk.&nbsp; So she's giving the Uniden model a shot.&nbsp; I still use the V-Tech 900mH model I've had since 1997 with absolutely no problems.&nbsp; Maybe it's just that I'm not as hard on my phone as most people.&nbsp; Probably because I don't use it all that often, and when not in use, it just rests it's little head on the charger.&nbsp; Where it is face down.&nbsp; All the new phones are face up.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; And they don't use common laws of gravity to stay in the charge base--with the nubs properly aligned and touching.   And then I priced MP3 players.&nbsp; One more $30 gift card from Target and I'm getting one.&nbsp; Or maybe I'll get one anyway.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; But&nbsp; I have a junk-load of music on my computer that I'd like to be able to listen to somewhere other than in my office.&nbsp; Like while running in the mornings, for instance.&nbsp; Or driving.&nbsp; Or wherever.   And then the bestest part of the day ever.&nbsp; We went to Dairy Queen.&nbsp; We tried the Moolattes.&nbsp; We died and went to heaven.&nbsp; I can validate spending $4 on a coffee drink now.&nbsp; Because that shit is from out of this world.&nbsp; I struggled deciding between the Mocha Moolatte and the brand new brownie batter blizzard.&nbsp; I'll try that next time.&nbsp; But dudes, go to the DQ and get hooked up.&nbsp; Mocha Moolatte is the way to go.   And just this minute I remember what it was that I was trying to remember that I forgot yesterday.&nbsp; I needed more sheer foundation.&nbsp; I cannot find the stuff anywhere anymore.&nbsp; It's Neutrogena's Healthy Defense.&nbsp; In the squeezy tube.&nbsp; With SPF30.&nbsp; They still make it.&nbsp; But nobody carries it around here.&nbsp; I bought the first three tubes of it at Osco Drug in Waterloo.&nbsp; There is no Osco here.&nbsp; Suck!   Last night I had a dream.&nbsp; The fourth in a series (back to back nights this week).&nbsp; In this one, I was dating Kevin Garnett.&nbsp; The only common thread of these four dreams is KG.&nbsp; What the hell does that mean?&nbsp; Very strange.

      Okay, I'm home.&nbsp; I'm tired.&nbsp; Note the hour and you'll see why.&nbsp; Six hours on a plane plus three in a car plus other events of the day just took it out of me.&nbsp; However it didn't take it out of me enough to sleep.&nbsp; I've been trying for the last couple hours and I think I'm too tired to sleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Event updates (the ones I remember since Sunday): Alan Webb's 1500m was nuts.&nbsp; I've never seen a miler take it out after 800 meters to the extent he did.&nbsp; He truly is the future of American distance running.&nbsp; I was skeptical.&nbsp; I'm not anymore.  &nbsp;  The 200m was blazing!&nbsp; Crawford and Gatlin will double in Athens (and double in the medals if they run the way they did over the trials).  &nbsp;  The women's 1500m was a disappointment.&nbsp; Suzy Favor-Hamilton dropped out with a hamstring injury (at least that was the rumor going around my area of the stands--Joey knows her, so I believe it).&nbsp; Marla Runyan (legally blind distance runner--already qualified in the 5000m) pulled out part way through the race (can't remember if it was 400 or 800 in) most likely due to the intense heat on Sunday.&nbsp; At the time of the race, the on-track temperature was above 115.&nbsp; Distance races are best conducted at around 65 or 70 degrees.&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; I guess Suzy will probably still make the Olympics because she's one of the few with the Olympic "A" standard.  &nbsp;  Deena Drossin-Kastor killed the 10K.&nbsp; But she was grabbing water about every lap due to the intense heat.  &nbsp;  Stacy Dragila nailed the vault.&nbsp; If it had been a tad cooler, I think she would have broken the world record (she was really close at 16'00.50, but brushed the bar and it tumbled).  &nbsp;  All in all, I had a great time at the Trials.&nbsp; Sacramento isn't a bad city, but I wouldn't want to live there.&nbsp; Too damned expensive.  &nbsp;  The flight home was decent.&nbsp; We left early, early this morning, and unwittingly were all on the same flight.&nbsp; Luckily for everyone else on the plane we were all too bagged to be our usual babbling selves.  &nbsp;  When we touched down in Minneapolis, I headed straight for home.&nbsp; I don't think anyone even realized what today was, which is both a blessing and a curse.&nbsp; But I think I may have worried the group when I blazed out of the airport and didn't stop until I got back here, where I promptly went out to the cemetery.&nbsp; I just hate today so much.&nbsp; Just hate it.  &nbsp;  I'm going to try to sleep now.&nbsp; That'll be the last update for the Trials.&nbsp; So stop emailing me to tell you how I though the men's high jump went.&nbsp; I didn't pay attention to it.&nbsp; And I didn't care to.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Whoever you are that keeps emailing me (I'm saving you face by not listing your email here), STOP.&nbsp; I'm not a news source.&nbsp; I never will be.&nbsp; Get a grip.&nbsp;

      Okay, every damned time I log on to this motherfucking blog today to write something new, I get tossed back out.&nbsp; Now that I'm in, they've changed some shit.&nbsp; Hopefully my font doesn't show up in the retarded font it shows up on the backend because if it does, well, that's a lot more goddamned work for me.&nbsp; And, uh, thanks for letting us all know you were making changes, blogger.&nbsp; Because being hungover, a little annoyed, and finding new (but not yet determined to be improved) software when all you really want to do is just whip out the claws and start tearing things to shreads.&nbsp; It's always a good day when it starts out with those thoughts.  &nbsp;  Onto much lighter notes.&nbsp; Mr H finally was allowed to disclose where he's going.&nbsp; He's in Indiana now.&nbsp; He'll be in Utah later this summer.&nbsp; Friggin' Utah?&nbsp; I'm not visiting him in Utah.&nbsp; Indiana I could swing.&nbsp; No thanks to the Utah drive.&nbsp; Have you ever driven from Iowa to Utah?&nbsp; Neither have I.&nbsp; But I hear it's the most boring ride in the history of life.  &nbsp;  Another lighter note.&nbsp; Jake and Nikki pulled off the surprise of the century on Thursday.&nbsp; They got married.&nbsp; I would imagine that Cathy screamed into the phone in utter perturbance at that news.&nbsp;Cathy is Jake's mom, by the way.&nbsp; Nikki's family knew about it the entire time.&nbsp; Greg (Jake's dad) knew about it from the inception of the idea.&nbsp; The people actually  at  the ceremony didn't know about it until it started.&nbsp; We went to the friggin' courthouse to pay one of the 37 parking tickets Travis' brother has received since he arrived.&nbsp; And because it was warm, they just told us to come into the courthouse and wait (myself, Travis, his wife, his brother, Dave, his sister, his girlfriend, Joey, his wife and son, and Nikki and Jake).&nbsp; We were on our way to go eat early lunch and get to the track to get decent seats (there are like 45 seats that hit the afternoon shade and are much better than the bleachers in the swealtering 95 degree sun), which is why we were  all  there.  &nbsp;  Note to everyone: if you're going to get married, this is the way to do it.&nbsp; No expensive fanfare.&nbsp; No fighting with bridesmaids.&nbsp; No fittings.&nbsp; Just an off-the-rack white sundress, button down shirt and flip flops for all.&nbsp; And no wedding showers from hell.&nbsp; No rediculous skits by people you don't know.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; If ever I decide to get married, this is the way it's going to go.&nbsp; This or Vegas.  &nbsp;  So, for the past few days, I've been staying in the athlete's hotel--much closer to the track.&nbsp; I figured that I'd give those two some honeymoon privacy (not to mention how completely weird it is to have a third person in your room when you're now a newly married couple).&nbsp; I stayed the two nights I paid for, so no loss to me.&nbsp; Plus the Internet here is free to the athletes, so I'm just pretending I'm an athlete.&nbsp; It's not that hard to pull off.&nbsp; Except for the remembering to use Jake's PIN to get into the computer.&nbsp; Which is annoying and I always have to ruffle through his papers to find, which is why I haven't written when I said I would.  &nbsp;  Update on the trials: Travis performed decently in the decathlon.&nbsp; He came in 11th, which when you consider he was only a provisional qualifier (I think he got the last spot--if not last, it was really close to it), is really quite good.&nbsp; He was disappointed with his throws, but he made up for it with a great 400m and a great 1500m.  &nbsp;  Marion Jones qualified in the Long Jump (and by qualified, I mean she blew the rest of the field away).&nbsp; I'm glad that she got those two days of down time to relax between the qualifying round and the finals, because she needed it after all the media was on her like flies on shit after failing to qualify in the 100m.&nbsp; She pulled out of the 200m, which was a good idea after seeing her in the quarterfinals, where she lost her heat but still qualified on time.&nbsp; It wasn't pretty.&nbsp; And she didn't look like she gave a damn.&nbsp; I did run into her after her long jump in the hotel (I've run into ridiculous amounts of people here--and they all think I'm one of them, which is...bizarre), and gave her a 'good job' and went about my business.&nbsp; She is probably one of the nicest athletes here, and it just sucks that she has all that USADA shit swirling around her.&nbsp; I believe she's clean.&nbsp; I truely believe it.  &nbsp;  Anything else of note?&nbsp; Let's see.&nbsp; Alan Webb is tiny.&nbsp; And bald.&nbsp; Which is sad for a 21-year-old.&nbsp; Allen Johnson is really nice (he bumped me in the lobby and apologized profusely for it).&nbsp; JJ Johnson is a player.&nbsp; Complete with catcalls.&nbsp; You find out the most random shit at the breakfast buffet.&nbsp; Tim Broe eats like a horse.&nbsp; The fitness facilities in this hotel are...shitty.&nbsp; I haven't seen them, but that's the consensus of the people at the breakfast buffet.&nbsp; I'm staying on vaulter row on the 16th floor.&nbsp; I trip over poles every time I enter and exit the room.&nbsp; They don't worry about them because it's such a task to get them into and out of the hotel that nobody would bother trying to take them.&nbsp; And if they did, someone would notice.&nbsp; It's a lot easier to run in the mornings around here because nobody cares and there is more open sidewalk on which to run.&nbsp; Dave's sister is staying with me tonight, and she wants to athlete-watch.&nbsp; She'll be disappointed.&nbsp; Most of them are leaving today.&nbsp; But she's fun anyway and it's always nice to have a roommate.  &nbsp;  Anything else that needs talking about?&nbsp; Nope, I don't think so.&nbsp; I'll come back if there is.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Fucking spellcheck doesn't work.&nbsp; I guess my typos will stay.

      So yesterday was a day off.  And so I didn't write like I said I would. Am I in trouble?  Because I'm really sorry.  Okay, I'm not sorry.  I caught up on sleep and caught up on buying some cute new shoes and caught up on buying a kick-ass new bathing suit and caught up on buying some other random stuff.  But I'm back now and I'll fill you in on all the news that's left up in my head.  So what happened on Day 4 of the trials?  None of my friends were competing, so it's all less important to me.  Marion Jones competed in the qualifying round of the Long Jump and made it (though she looked like she might throw up the entire time--she's got boat-loads of stress on her shoulders).  The men and women's 5000 meters happened.  Marla Runyan was defeated by a fellow American for the first time in like five years (and just barely, at that--Shayne Culpepper got up and nabbed her at the tape).  The men's 800m was exciting because a collegian (Joshua Johnson I believe is his name) took a spot from the favored American (who's name has escaped me at the moment--I'll edit it in when I remember it), but an acquaintance of ours (Derrick Peterson) came in third for a spot on the Olympic team.  Then there were various other qualifying events with people in them that I don't know so I didn't pay a lot of attention.  The women's 800m was won by Jearl Miles-Clark who is still mad-talented, even at the ripe old age of 37 (she's now been on five Olympic teams--I think that's a record for a track athlete).  Her sister-in-law, Hazel Clark made the team with her and also got engaged right after the race.  Her fiance was all kinds of nervous and then of course the NBC crew shoved a camera and a microphone in their respective faces right after the fact and she looked like she couldn't be more annoyed by the questions the reporter (who I've never seen before) was asking.  The rock was nice and large, though.  It showed up well on the jumbotron.  That was the extent of the trials information I retained on Monday.  But here's that funny (probably only to me) story I promised.  Nikki, Jake, Dave, Travis and I went to the mall Monday afternoon and I noticed that a group of little girls were staring at us.  Now, I'll preface this story with an explanation of my hair color.  It is actually brown.  Light brown these days.  But sitting here in the hot sun for three days has caused my light brown to look a lot more blonde than it has been in a while (a color I once used to achieve with lots of bottled maintenance).  The hair color information will be pertinent later on.  So these little girls (12-14 years old, I'd say) were in the food court sort of pointing and discussing which one was going to be the bravest and approach us.  I figured they were pointing at Jake and thought okay, that's cool.  Kids always want his autograph (at least kids that know of him, which is rare outside of CF).  We were sitting down to a meal of sesame chicken, which was quite good, by the way, and this tiny little thing saunters up to the table and asks me for an autograph (she was so cute I thought about putting her in my pocket and carrying her home with me, not to mention she was all shy and blushing).  I hated, absolutely hated, to ask her who she thought I was, because it clearly took a lot of talking to get her to come over in the first place.  But I can't sign an autograph and have her go back to her friends and go "who?", so I asked.  At this point, Nikki is nearly wetting herself with laughter and Jake, Travis and Dave are trying hard not to break out into hysterics because as they all know, I'm nobody famous and would never ever want to be.  So after asking who she thought I was, she said her friends thought I either had to be Amy Acuff or Erin Aldrich (both high jumpers competing in the trials) because of the height and the fact that I was wearing a USA Track & Field tshirt.  I got the Amy Acuff thing once already this weekend, but I don't share many features with Erin.  I know Erin from an intense meeting of the volleyball minds in college (and from around the meets--she's another double sporter--there aren't many of us and we often commiserated when we ran into each other).  Anyway, I broke it to this adorable little girl that I wasn't a high jumper and wasn't even competing in the trials.  I made Jake, Dave and Travis give her their autographs instead just so she could go back to her friends with something (not that it was much, but it was better than absolutely nothing).  Then I gave her my fortune cookie (not because I didn't want it, but I was feeling generous).  Then I made Travis give her his fortune cookie.  Because he's not done competing yet and he shouldn't be eating shitty stuff.  HA!  He was bitter the rest of the day.   But that leads me into several mistaken identity encounters over the weekend that actually make complete sense now that I've met Amy (I met her yesterday at the meet--we were actually sitting with her fiance, whom I mentioned in the last edition (Tye Harvey)).  Anyway, on the first day of the meet, I had three or four people tap me on the shoulder to ask how I've been.  My turning around caused them to flinch at their own error and apologize profusely for thinking I was someone else.  It never in a million years occurred to me that I was being mistaken for a world class high jumper.  And nobody ever said who they were mistaking me for.  The same story on days two and three.  Three or four people every day here are mistaking me for her.  And since the city is almost overrun with people attending the trials, I'm now getting mistaken for her outside the stadium.   So after meeting Amy Monday (after the mistaken identity at the mall), I finally get it.  I sat down at one end of the group of people we were with and she sat down at the other.  One of Dave's sisters was sitting down in front of us and told us we looked like goddamned bookends.  I was a little slow on the uptake and apparently wasn't the only one.  I looked to my left to find...nobody.  I guess she looked to her right and found the same.  I leaned forward looking in her direction and she leaned forward looking in mine.  And then the people between us busted out laughing like the jackals that they are.  And then I yelled at her for causing me pain and suffering.  And then she laughed at me because I guess someone asked her how Mr H was doing and she had no idea what the guy was talking about (and the guy ran off like a scared mouse when she turned around because he had mistaken her for me).  We later found out the guy to be Travis' brother who I haven't seen in a year or so, but who knew I was at the trials.  I smacked him on the head for his mistake.  I'm cruel like that.   But anyway, that was the funniest story of the trip so far.  Not the best story.  But the funniest.  For me, anyway.  The rest of you might not find it the least bit amusing.  Now while I was typing that all out, I forgot everything else that was floating around in my brain to tell you guys, so I guess if I remember it, I'll include it in the next update.  Which may not be until Friday.  A lot of the things going on these last two days do not a good story make.  Not that this one probably did, but I told you anyway.

      Okay, so since today is the first off-day in a series of two off-days I'm going to do nothing.  Because I'm wiped out.  Stupid sun.  So in my doing nothingness, I am updating the blog with something other than an update of trial-related things.  With that, I bring you the  Three Things About Me  list that I again stole from Nikki.   three things I'm wearing  1. Navy tank top 2. White running shorts 3. Towel on my head    three things currently on my desk  1. Lamp 2. Hilton notepad 3. Hilton area guide    three things I want to do before I die  1. Travel abroad 2. Buy a house 3. Win the lottery (I should start playing I suppose)    three good ways to describe my personality  1. Random 2. Fun 3. Intense    three bad things about my personality  1. Temper 2. My moods change faster than the Iowa weather 3. I hold grudges    three things I like about my body  1. Hair 2. Eyes 3. Stomach    three things I don't like about my body  1. Knees 2. Ankles 3. Feet    three things most people don't know about me  1. I've only been to two amusement parks in my life.  Both after the age of 22 2. I ran away from home when I was 14.  I was gone for a week.  I'd still be gone if a friend hadn't made me go home. 3. I once had the state high school record in the 400m hurdles.  For less than a half hour.  That was my last hurdles race.    three things I say the most  1. "That's funny" (when something clearly is not) 2. "Goddamned" (when I'm mad at myself--often) 3. "Seriously" (in different tones of voice it serves millions of different meanings--kinda like "fuck")    three places I want to go  1. Italy 2. Hawaii (for vacation) 3. Fiji    last three things I've eaten today  1. Omelet 2. Toast 3. Cantaloupe   If you're here looking for Olympic Trials - Sacramento, CA - Part IV, wait till later today.  I have a funny story in this one.  It may only be funny to me.  Aww, my grandma just called me to see if I wanted to come out to the farm for dinner.  I guess the parents went to a funeral today (Dad's uncle--a relative I've never met) and she didn't want me having to worry about dinner myself.  She's so cute.  And forgetful.  I moved out of the parent's house and I'm about six states away.  I told her all that last week.  She's making meat loaf because it's my favorite.  I hate meat loaf.  She's so forgetful.  She's 80, and she's good at it.  How cute.

      I find myself sunburned yet again this summer.  Not for lack of SPF, but because when it's 91 degrees outside and you're sitting in the sweltering sun from 1pm until sundown (and then some), you just can't really avoid it.  HOT!  The pole vault last night was quite possibly the most impressive vaulting performance I've witnessed in my life.  And I've seen (and heard about) a LOT of vaulting.  Jake pulled in a 9th place (he couldn't get his sticky grips to work right with the intense heat on the field--it made them too sticky).  During his second attempt at 18'4, the adhesive on the tape near his grip on the pole started to slide causing his easy clear to become a miss (his flailing hand nudged the bar).  The winning height was 19'4.  Three other guys were over 19'.  A guy that jumped 19'+ in the finals of the Olympic Trials has NEVER been left off of the Olympic team before.  But this year, Tye Harvey will have to stay home.  Tim Mack, Crash Stevenson and Derek Miles will be headed to Athens.  If all goes well (as it did for them yesterday), the US could conceivably bring home all three medals.  The 100m?  Was straight up good viewing.  From our prime (but not) spots in the stands, we couldn't tell who won that final until they showed the photo on the jumbotron.  And even then it was ridiculously close.  Nice to see that both Tim and Marion will not be contesting the 100m in Athens.  Neither have had the proper training time needed this season to compete successfully in the Olympic rounds.  Both looked really sloppy.  Both are swirling with drug controversy.  Tim moreso than Marion.  I don't actually believe Marion is dirty (there aren't the tell-tale signs as there clearly were with Regina Jacobs).  Tim on the other hand looks guilty as all hell every time they talk to him.  Marion has been dominant since she stepped foot on the track in high school.  Tim has not.  Tim was successful for one year and one year only.  Which just screams drug cheat.  Marion had a baby last year, which contributes to her off-track distractions (and running shape).  Tim has no speed-related excuses there.  Shawn Crawford is just as fast and talented as he was back in college when he busted up the 200m indoor world record against Coby Miller.  I was at that meet.  It was fucking awesome to watch.  The man is built like a Mack truck.  You may also remember him from FOX's Man vs Beast.  I think he raced a zebra or something.  It was amusing.  I watched it.  I laughed really hard.  So the 100m field could easily take all the medals in Athens as well.  Gatlin is straight up crazy talented.  And then Mo Greene of course.  The three fastest times in the world were run last night in the finals by these three men.  I can't wait to watch the Olympics.  On television.  At home.  Without a gyro.  Anyway.  It's time to go buy some aloe and food and stuff.  I'll tell you about tonight's action tomorrow.  I also may have some guest reporters to update you all in the next few days.  We'll see.  Until tomorrow, I bid you farewell.

      Well, some disappointing news from the trials last night.  Joey had the semifinals last night in the 400m hurdles and came in 5th, leaving him out of the final and out of the Olympics.  Needless to say, he was very disappointed.  This will probably be his last shot after failing to have made it in '96, '00, and now '04.  But stranger things have happened, and he could still find himself at the trials in '08.  It just depends on what he decides to do, I guess.  I'd love to see him keep going, but then again age is always a factor on the track.  Another disappointment was Marion Jones.  I don't know how many of you out there watched the semifinals and finals on television last night, but they were ugly.  I've seen Marion run in several races (none this season--which is probably the problem) and have never seen her run so sloppily.  Her starts were abysmal and it appeared she was lugging a 20lb monkey on her back through the entirety of the races.  Some guy in the hotel lobby last night said she didn't look any different than usual on television, however in person, it was ugly.  And Lauryn Williams has a ridiculous form, but anyone who saw the finals last night knows that with another few weeks of polish, she'll be difficult to beat in Athens.  She damn near face-planted out of the blocks and still managed to get up for third place (and the final slot to Athens).  Also, SO weird to see Latasha Colander running the 100m.  I ran the 400m against her years ago, and I can tell you that the 400m and the 100m are two entirely different beasts.  But good for her.  Nikki is nodding over my shoulder on this--"that's like a 400m runner deciding to run the marathon and then winning the damn thing".  Hey, it could happen (says the former 400m runner who gained a new love for distances and considered a marathon before the foot problems of summer '04 interrupted any thoughts of that).  As for the weather yesterday?  Complete opposite from Friday.  Friday was cool and windy (cool in northern California terms is in the 70s).  Yesterday was warm and still.  If there'd been humidity it would have felt just like home.  But everyone knows California doesn't have humidity.  I happened to hear Carol Lewis interviewing one of the athletes after the women's 400m last night and she asked about how the heat affected the woman.  The woman, who I do not know, nor do I remember her name, said that it was really warm and made it difficult to stay hydrated.  I'd buy that line of bull if I wasn't a runner and didn't live where the humidity is straight up out of control in the summertime.  Dehydration is nearly a way of life around home.  You learn to control it, and you savor any race you run where the humidity doesn't live.  So to this athlete I say, "shut up."  Tonight's events include the pole vault final (which starts at about 1:30 (3:30 CT) this afternoon, so my mentioning it should be on television LIVE was actually quite unlikely.  Unless they're still jumping at 4:00, which I guess is a possibility, but if that's the case, then they are having some issues clearing heights.  Which is never a good sign.  They'll probably just tell you who won, show the winning jump, tell you who got second and third, show their final jumps, and then call it a day.  Okay, I promised that if I had more time today I'd tell you what happened in the qualifying round of the vault.  Jeff Hartwig was on the runup to his final attempt at the qualifying height.  He got nearly to the plant-portion of the runup (I'm so not a vaulter so this is all just my own terms for things) and bailed.  He didn't "break the plane", so he wasn't charged with another miss.  Vaulters have a minute to complete any attempt.  If you go over the allotted time, you are red-flagged and a miss is charged to you.  On Hartwig's way back to his mark on the runway, he asked the official how much time he had left.  The official said 12 seconds.  Hartwig then proceeded to sprint back to the end of the runway (to his mark) and then decided to switch to a smaller pole (Jake said that he did this because he said he was getting tired--this shouldn't have been the case as he'd only jumped one full attempt--he bailed on his first attempt).  By the time he got his other pole, another official had red-flagged him, rendering his turn over (emphasized by the placing of an orange cone in the runway).  He complained loudly and filed a protest.  Once the protest was filed, he should have been able to complete a 4th attempt at the jump and then let the protest be investigated.  HOWEVER, the man in charge argued with him for another 20+ minutes before he was allowed his protest jump, which he failed to clear.  Now, this is important (and the other athletes reading this will understand), because 20 minutes in cool conditions doing nothing but stand around and argue with the official (who was wrong) makes your muscles tighten up.  If you've ever watched vaulters while they're waiting for their turn, they flail around, jump around and try to keep moving at all times.  You'll often see them running up and down the length of the track to keep warm.  Hartwig wasn't able to do this.  Once he was allowed his protest jump, he had to do it immediately.  No re-warming up.  No nothing.  And by no nothing, I also mean no time to remeasure for his start mark.  Which the officials had torn off the runway by the time he was allowed his 4th jump.  It was utter ridiculousness going down there.  Now, to clarify, he missed his protest jump and then his protest was denied.  The problem lies in the fact that the official didn't know that he was supposed to allow him the protest jump as soon as the motion is filed.  This was also the case with Hanna's protest.   All of this is emphasized by the fact that there were about 8 people in the stands (us included) with cameras (video and/or digital) who were allowed onto the field to play back their captures to reveal that after the yellow flag was raised (indicating 15 seconds remaining) AND being told by the official that he had 12 seconds remaining (note the discrepancy already), Hartwig was only allowed 8 seconds before the red flag was raised.  All eight people with cameras (Nikki included) proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the official who threw the red flag and the cone was in the wrong.  To add insult to injury, he called Jake for volzing on his first attempt at the qualifying height, which was complete and utter bullshit (also evidence on the tapes).  For those of you I've now officially lost with use of a term you've never heard before, volzing is when the vaulter, after clearing the bar (usually) uncleanly, places the bar back onto the pegs with his hands on the followthrough.  It's pretty clear that they had a field official in place that didn't know the rules, and at the Olympic trials, that's just unacceptable.   Then of course there's the set up of the facility.  The vault pit is located at the end of the track, running perpendicular to the homestretches.  The stadium is built like a bowl with the corners niched out.  The location and setup of the pit led to swirling winds.  You'd start your runup with a tailwind and by the time you reached the pit (5-7 seconds), you'd be facing a straight on headwind.  And the wind kept knocking down the bar during lulls in the action.  It just wasn't set up right.  Joey had complaints about the quality of the track as well (for hurdlers, those kinds of things come into play far more than the rest of the events).  He said it was a mondo surface that was either extremely worn or just completely messed up.  From my brief hikes across the track to intervene in the events involving the vault official, I can say that the surface was just not standard.  Squishy in some places and hard in others.  Anyway, Joey said he was flying over the hurdles and it messed up his step count (too much air and not enough contact with the track).  He nonchalantly mentioned it in the prelims, but you could tell how thrown he (and others) were during the semis.  The guy that edged him out of his heat was a guy who'd run four or five meets on the Sac State track this season, so he was used to it.  My overall impression of the quality of the facilities at Sac State:  Shoddy at best.  The stands are great.  Press room sucks.  Warm up facilities virtually non-existant.  Infield isn't bad, though it could stand to be rolled to prevent those of us with the wobbly ankles from breaking an ankle.  Runways to both the long jump and pole vault appear to be quite worn from the sun.  The two vault runways are parallel to each other, causing warmups to be distracting at best.  The officials are completely unaware of several well-known rules.  It echoes wicked bad down on the field (I saw several athletes pull up after a start thinking they'd been called back on a false start, only to realize it was just the echo).  There is an area near the fourth turn where they've changed the color of the track.  Whether that's cosmetic or because it's been patched is a question I have yet to receive an answer to, but it's distracting and not necessary.  The locker rooms are apparently quite nice as far as locker rooms go.  The volunteers are the most competent people on the staff.  All of this is just after two days of observations.  Imagine my thoughts on it at the end of next week.  OH!  After an angry (but not) email from someone, I realized that I had neglected to mention that Travis is getting geared up for the Decathlon later in the week.  I COMPLETELY forgot about Travis.  I should be punished.  Harshly.  So, in a new and updated and corrected count, there are two athletes remaining that I know and love.  Yesterday there were actually three.  Today, just two.  HOPEFULLY someone gets himself qualified for the Olympics so I can sit and wonder whether or not I can swing a quick trip to Athens (the answer will most likely be no, but I can dream, can't I?).  Anything not in this issue, will be in the next one.  I think.  Unless there are more issues.  Which there will be.  Because Travis doesn't hit the track until Friday.  So next weekend's updates will be all Travis.  All the time.  (Have I paid my penance yet, Travis?)

      Just a brief update (Nikki needs the computer as soon as she removes herself from her much-too-long shower).  We arrived in Sacramento early (very early) yesterday morning and managed to make it to the hotel without any semblance of directions (call it beginners luck).  I've been here before, but I wasn't driving, not to mention that I wasn't paying any attention to where we were in relation to anything else.  But, in a series of right "wrong" turns, we ended up in the parking lot to the Hilton, where our very comfortable beds were waiting for us.  The room?  Much larger than the two of us need.  We could charge rent to a couple people and not even know they were here.  I guess we're used to low-rate motels on most T&F related journeys (Motel 6, to be exact).  Anyway, to wrap this up a little quicker than usual, of the seven athletes we know quite well (one must distinguish, because the T&F community is small and we all kinda know -- or know of -- each other), two made it out of qualifying rounds.  Joey and Jake in the 400m hurdles and pole vault, respectively.  It was ridiculously windy yesterday, so Jake making the pole vault finals was a feat in and of itself.  Especially seeing as the American Record holder didn't even clear a height (much controversy there and I'll explain more if I have time in Part II).  But those finals should be televised live on Sunday evening on NBC.  I believe Joey's next round of hurdles comes on Sunday as well, but I'd have to go have a look at my now-missing schedule of events to be sure.  Nikki needs the computer now so she can send off some files to the Courier and update their commentary.  We'll keep you up to date on things from here.  Or we'll try to anyway.

      You kids and your questions.  I theived this (by force) from Mr H.  Nikki made me do it.  Lock her up, not me.   What is the geekiest part of your music collection?  I no longer have any geeky music.  The bad CDs were done away with in the flood.  The good ones were saved.  That's a pretty easy way to get rid of the bad without embarrassment that you ever owned two copies of a Sheryl Crow CD (whether you purchased them or not).   What is your secret guaranteed weeping movie?  Armageddon   If you could have plastic surgery, what would you have done?   I'd get some scars fixed.   Do you have a completely irrational fear?   Heights, but that probably wouldn't stop me if the opportunity to sky dive approached.   What is the little physical habit that gives away your insecure moment?   I fidget with my fingers (from playing with a hangnail to biting them).   Do you know anyone famous?  Depends on the level of fame you're looking for.  The person that I ripped this from is famous.  If you're looking for Olympic athletes, football players or basketball players, I can probably find someone to get you in contact with them, or I can look them up on my phone.   Describe your bed:  Queen size with no headboard.   Spontaneous or plan?  A bit of both.  Spontaneity is good, but sometimes planning is required.   Who should play you in a movie about your life?  Uma Thurman.     Do you know how to play poker?  Yeah, I'm decent at it.   What do you carry with you at all times?  Chapstick, keys, phone.   What do you miss most about being little?  Innocence.

How much money would it take to get you to give up the Internet for one year?   Depends on what I would have around me to entertain me.   What color is your bedroom?  White and hunter green.  That's gonna change.   What was the last song you were listening to?  "Tracing"   Have you ever been in a play?  Several (The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, Arsenic and Old Lace, Carousel, My Fair Lady, and several other little plays).   Have you ever been in love?  Three times.   Do you talk a lot?  It depends on the situation.  If I know a lot of people well, then I'll babble forever.  If I don't, I will remain quite quiet.   Do transient, homeless, or starving people sometimes annoy you?  I've never had an encounter with one.  Welcome to Iowa.   Do you consider yourself to be a nice person?  Sometimes.   What is your ideal wedding location?  Wherever my friends are, but hopefully the beach.   Favorite fabric?  Silk   Something you both love and hate?  People   What kind of bedding do you use?  I prefer my 300 count sheets, but right now I'm using some tshirt sheets because they're what I could find.   Do you tell your friends about your sex life?  Depends on the friend.  Also depends on what they ask.   What's the one language you want to learn?  Italian   How do you eat an apple?

Most of those funny things happen when you're the only one there to see them or the only one who thinks they're funny.   Do you drive stick?  No   What's one trait you hate in a person?  Stupidity   What kind of watch(es) do you wear?  A Nike race watch or a silver bracelet-style watch.  Lately, though, it's been no watch at all.   Most frivolous purchase?   Frivolous?  I don't do frivolous.  Unless my upcoming trip is considered frivolous.  Which it isn't.   Do you consider yourself materialistic?  No.  Unless we're talking shoes.  And then it's more of an obsession.   What do you cook the best?  Spaghetti   Favorite writing instrument?  It's a blue pen with black ink and a rubber grip that I swiped from the bank.   Do you prefer to stand out or blend in?  Blend in, but that never happens.   What's one car you will never buy?  One of those giant, house-sized SUVs.  Who needs that much room?  Or a minivan.  Shoot me if I ever even think of buying a minivan.  Minivans just mean you have too many kids to cart around.   What kind of books do you like to read?  Anything that can keep my attention after I put it down for the night.  I have to be motivated to pick it back up the next day.  If it doesn't make the pick up the next evening, put it back on the shelf, because I'm probably never going to finish it.   If you won the lottery, what would you do?  Buy a vacation home.  Buy a regular home.  Pay off my debt.  Invest the rest and live off the interest.   Burial or cremation?  Burial.  Or Cremation.  I think burial, unless it was a disfiguring death.  Then cremation.   How many online journals do you read regularly?  15, I think.  Maybe 20.  Define regularly.   What's one thing you're a sore loser at?  I don't think I'm a sore loser.  I don't like losing, but I'm pretty graceful in defeat.  Sometimes.  I think it depends on the game and the opponent.   What kind of first impression do you think you give to people?  Intimidating, sarcastic and sometimes bitchy.     What do you like to do alone?  Sing, write, read, think.  I don't like running alone, but I do it daily.   Are you a giver or a taker?  Both.   When's the last time you cried?  Yesterday   Favorite communication method?  face-to-face or email.  NEVER phone.   How many drinks before you're tipsy?  Depends on the drink, but quite a few.  My metabolism is a beast.

      Okay, I have all my flight plans confirmed, my hotel room paid for, and my meet tickets secured.  I am going to Sacramento come hell or high water (and with the rate it's raining, high water might come).  Nikki and I fly out on Thursday evening from Minneapolis (using a combination of my frequent flier miles and her half-comped travel vouchers), we're staying at the Hilton (almost completely paid for by her club--we pay for the non-competition nights), and we used the family/friends discount for the meet tickets ($80 compared to $250 per person).  Oh, and we have press credentials.  Because Nikki works with a club that is funded by both the local newspaper and the local television station.  And we promised to take lots of pictures and document our trip with daily updates to the newspaper and daily telephone interviews with the television station (via telephone).  Nikki also managed to "borrow" a mini DV camera from the university television station (meaning she has permission from someone she's not entirely sure had authority to provide permission).    Discounts rule, you guys!  Flight: $90 round trip/person Hotel: $260 per person for entire stay (breakfast included) Tickets: $80 per person ===================== Total: $430 plus food, rental car (which will probably be paid for by the club), and shopping.  For a trip that lasts from early evening on the 8th of July to the middle of the day on the 19th, that's pretty damned cheap.  Now if I could just get confirmation on when the parents' furniture is coming (supposedly Saturday, but who knows), I'd know if I need to leave them the keys to move their old stuff over to my place (which I'm still not in because the AC still doesn't work--hopefully tomorrow).  But once I'm on the plane, I will forget about worrying about the furniture and stuff.  Yay vacation!  Yay vacation with friends (especially friends that are like my second, more family-like family).

      Okay, so this post, for the most part, will not be about me.  Except, that is, to say that my new favorite channel on the television is CNNfn.  It's the financial partner to regular CNN.  Except at night.  When it's the british version of CNN.  Which is the best.  CNN. EVER!!  There is one guy (Richard something or other) who is quite possibly the oddest man on television and he is just funny as hell to watch.  They sent him to New Hampshire for the primaries this past Winter and the first thing he said to the CNN crew back in the fn studios was that he was "freezing his jibblies off."  I couldn't stop laughing for like an hour.  If you have this channel, I highly recommend you watch it for that alone.  Not to mention you'll get far more news about what's going on anywhere else in the world (whereas with regular CNN, you get national news and a little peppering of international news when Paula Zahn decides she wants to talk about it).  So, really, go watch some CNNfn when you can't sleep.  It's totally worth the lack of REM hours.  Onto a much less me-related topic (aren't you grateful?).  What is it actually like to be living in Iraq right now?  We here in America have absolutely no clue.  We've never (in modern times, anyway) had a country come in here and take our leader out of office (sometimes I wish they would) and then have other people living in our own country start blowing people and things up because they didn't like what this other country was doing.  Perhaps they are just defending their country.  They're doing what we might do if faced with the same circumstances.  I don't know how many of us would just sit back and take some country who we've hated (or were supposed to have been hating) for years came in and tore down everything we knew (good or bad) and started dictating what kind of things would need to go on in our country.    Imagine what would go down if our situations were reversed.  The Bush family has been drilling into our heads how evil Iraq and it's government were since 1988.  Saddam has been doing the same to the Iraqi people about us.  Imagine if Saddam had declared war on the US, stormed in (suspend the reality that the US has a much stronger military for the moment), sent Bush into hiding, and subsequently blew up every person in the Cabinet, as well as any and all military leaders, finally found and then held Bush without so much as due process, and then put an Iraqi-approved lackey in the leadership roll (as interim president).  Would we, as Americans, sit back and let any of this happen without at least putting up a guerilla-style fight?  I'm pretty certain we'd be attempting to take out any bit of leadership we could find.  I don't think we'd go as extreme as beheading people, but we'd blow some shit up, that's for damn sure.  We've got like 200 little militia groups around this country (probably many more than that, actually) that thrive on this kind of thing.  Any opportunity that they got, they'd take and blowing people and things up comes pretty naturally to a lot of those groups.  I don't condone anything that is being done in Iraq, but I think I understand it.  Just like a lot of people like George W here, a lot of people liked Saddam there.  A lot of people prospered while he was in power, even though he was well-known to kill you if you spoke poorly of him or did poorly by him.  Not to mention the other countries surrounding Iraq.  Iraq having a democracy would not be prosperous for most of them.  Imagine a dictatorship in the US.  Canada and Mexico wouldn't benefit from that (I would imagine).  How willing would they be to let a dictatorship be put in here?  Better yet, how willing would countries like India be to let a dictatorship be put in here?  They get a crap-load of exported jobs from the US, and with a dictatorship, that pretty much goes out the window.  Mexico wouldn't get the companies and jobs that come with them, either.  I mean, think in terms of the world's economy alone.  If the US were taken over, that would take a huge nosedive.  On the same level, if Iraq is successfully turned into a democracy, the world's tyranists would lose one of their largest contributors.  Those tyranists (is that a word?) are going to do anything in their power to get back what they're losing.  Which is why al Queda is all over Iraq like flies on shit.  If Osama loses this (especially to the evil US), he loses a lot.  I guess all I'm saying is that in order for us to understand the Iraqi people (the good and the bad) is to try to imagine what we all (the good and the bad here) would do in that situation.  We don't know for certain until we are in that situation, but I suspect it would be somewhat similar to what the Iraqis are doing.  And for the record, I'm thinking Iraq is going to turn into another Israel.  People will be blown up daily.  And there isn't a lot we can do to stop it.  I just finished watching the Wimbledon final between Roger Federrer and Andy Roddick.  It was a spectacular match.  Federrer won, but at many many points in the game, it could have gone either way.  Congratulations to Federrer (because he reads this, you know.  Okay I'm lying).  Andy Roddick (after losing in the finals to Roger Federrer) -- "I threw the kitchen sink at him, but he went to the bathroom and got the tub."  when asked about the burgeoning rivalry with Federrer -- "I'm gonna have to start winning some of 'em to call it a rivalry."  Even in defeat, Roddick brings the funny.  Great match.

      Alright, it's that time of year again. That's right.  It's Big Brother time.  Now some of you may know that a few years back I was completely and utterly obsessed with recapping the live feeds.  Last year, the love was lost.  This year, I'm completely undecided on.  The cast seems a little less loath-worthy this season (as you may know, last season there was no more than two likeable people, and I think they were only likeable by default--surround yourself with the cruddiest people on the planet and you will come out smelling like a rose, even if you are a complete nutjob).    And this year I may actually have time to recap, and DSL to keep my computer from attempting to blow right up (dial up and recapping makes for a whole damn lot of work).  But will my new place be set up to accommodate that kind of recapping?  I don't know yet.  I moved my bed and closet-items over this morning (with kind help from a passing through stranger--okay, it wasn't a stranger, but he just happened to be headed up to Minneapolis and stopped here on the way (which is completely out of the way) and helped little ole' me with the pre-move move.  Thanks Travis.  You MUST return to get your reward for your humanitarian efforts.  Or some food or beer or something).  The rest will be moved sometime at the end of this weekend or next week sometime.  I plan on hitting an Independence Day sale at McGregor's to get a new desk for my computer (not that I can move the computer until the parents' new one gets here).  We remember the flood damage, right?  The problem comes in when I note that I only have two televisions and one will go in the living room while the other will go in my bedroom.  This leaves no background noise for the recapping.  I have to have background noise while recapping, otherwise I just lose my will to bother.  I also have no more stereos to hook up anywhere but in the living room (with the television and the surround sound audio), and the newly decided upon fitness room (where it is just a mini-stereo).  I could move that from one room to the other whenever I need to, but that's just a lot of prep to sit down and recap and we all know I don't like a lot of prep-work for much of anything.  I lose interest.  Anyway, I have no idea just how much I want to recap anyway.  Not to be all up on myself, but I posted once on that board already and one of the mods was almost up my ass begging me to recap.  I know I won't have the same dedication I had to it two seasons ago (where obsessed with it might be considered the understatement of the millennium).  Mostly because I really enjoy that whole sleep thing these days, not that I get a lot of it lately, but I do enjoy what comes my way.  And then the second or third week of the show, I'm probably going to Sacramento for a few days.  And then to wherever I want to go toward the end of the summer.  I have no idea.  So, I guess I may or may not recap depending on a variety of things.  Anyway, I mentioned the new set up of the new house.  I decided to utilize all of the four bedrooms (why close them off and let the spiders have them, right?).  I am using one as my bedroom (obviously--and I'm using the largest with the 3/4 bath attached).  One will be the office (with my former living room furniture and computer desk and other office-related things).  The third bedroom will be my at-home gym.  I'm taking the exercise equipment that has been stored in the garage since about a week after it was purchased (I'm guessing 12 years ago) and instead of going in search of a work-out facility, am creating my own.  We have a bowflex and free weights and the like, so why not use them, right?  The fourth bedroom will be the guest bedroom.  I'm taking my old twin bed and setting it up in there (the bed has been in storage since I went to college) and my old bedroom furniture to go with it (who doesn't like white veneer furniture?  I don't, but it works for that, I suppose).  So that almost fills the house.  I guess I have more at my fingertips here than I thought I did (it helps muchly that I'm getting the old living room furniture from the parents).  I'm so excited about it that I can barely stand it.  Now who wants to help me with the big furniture?  You know you do.  There's not even any packing involved.  The rest has been boxed up for--well--since I moved last time.  Easy as pie.  And maybe you'll get some of that pie if you help me move.  Please.  Please please please?!

      I'm finally home. We left for Rochester at 2am Wednesday. I got home an hour ago. I have not slept. I will probably not be coherent.  Why is Babe Chandler such an idiot? Okay, that's off topic. But why?  Okay, back to the day yesterday. Grandpa was supposed to go in for an angiogram at 6am. At 9:30, they finally came to get him for that. I don't know how long those typically take, but he was in there until 11:30. The doctors had told Lois (my step-grandma) that they'd probably just take him right to surgery after the angiogram, so we all assumed he'd gone there. Until they called us back to the same little prep room and grandpa was wide awake and as full of piss and vinegar as he always is. He was getting annoyed having 9 people standing around staring at him, so he told us to go to lunch. Myself, my mother, my dad and my uncle went, and while we were gone, they came and got him for surgery. This had to be around 12:15 or so.  They'd told us that the actual surgery would only take about 25 minutes (a valve repair), and that we could wait in the family waiting room on the 5th floor of the Brigh building. We went. We waited. At 3:30 (with all of us thoroughly on edge), the information nurse called the waiting room and said they'd just put him on the heart/lung machine. Meaning he'd  just  started surgery. At this point, no one had come to tell us whether or not he needed any bypasses, which is what the angiogram was supposed to tell them. We didn't hear another thing until around 5:45. They said he was off the heart/lung machine. Which meant they'd done the surgery, but he wasn't closed up yet. They said it'd be about another hour before we heard anything else. At 8:30, after I finally went back to the ICU to see what the hell was up, they said he'd had to go back on the heart/lung machine because someone  finally  read the angiogram results and found he needed a bypass, on top of the  two  valve repairs (they never said two--only one was reported to any of us). This all should have been reported to us so we weren't sitting around waiting to see him, and it should have been reported shortly after they'd realized it.  Through all of this waiting, we spoke with a family that was waiting far less patiently than we were for news on their 24-year-old daughter. She had the same surgery as grandpa, and she, we found out later, was not fairing well. It turned out that she was having the same surgeon, as well. Which is why they kept neglecting to tell us everything. They were busy trying to save this girl's life. So I understand all that now, but I was hopping mad at the time.  Anyway, at about 11:45, they called us back and told us that the surgery was over and that he'd faired very well. Everything had gone as expected. I scoff at this, because it had gone nothing like any of us expected, because we weren't told much for a long damned time. At this point, they said he'd be set up in his ICU room in about 30 minutes. 30 minutes turned into over 5 hours. I'd have gone back to find out what was going on, but the doors were locked because visiting hours were long over and you had to have a hospital ID to get back there.  When the night nurses finally realized that there was an entire family still waiting for news in the waiting room at 5am (all still awake, and all assuming the absolute worst), they came out and told us he was fine but that we'd have to wait until 8am to see him. They never said why. The family of the 24-year-old did say that they were probably busy stabilizing her, because it took until about 4:30 before they got word that she was out of surgery. And not doing well.  Why get a hotel room for three hours, right? So we stayed in the damned waiting room until 8am.  My 91-year-old grandpa was doing better with the same surgery than a 24-year-old. That makes no sense at all. This man has asthma, allergies, has had a stroke, prostate cancer, and a host of other medical issues. And he survived this. Before we finally got in to see grandpa, the family of the girl were told that she crashed in the ICU and they were unable to revive her. She didn't make it. It really doesn't make any sense.  My uncle said (and we all agreed) that we all had gone into it assuming the worst. We all assumed he wouldn't make it out of surgery. He's a tough old bird though. And I'm happy to report that upon seeing him (he's still heavily sedated), he's going to be fine. I really feel terrible for that other family, though. Life is so strange.

      Okay kids, I didn't have a chance to call people, and some emails bounced back, so here's the deal.  I'm going to be out of town for a few days.  My grandfather (on my dad's side) is having major heart surgery, so I'm going up to Rochester for anywhere from one to three days.  He's 91, and at his age, it's not out of the realm of possibility that something will go wrong, so I need to be there just in case.  I'll update everyone when I get back.  Hopefully it'll go well and I'll have all good news to share.  Send good healing vibes to my grandfather care of the Mayo Clinic.

      And that somebody is me. I feel like I haven't slept in months. I cannot get back into a normal sleeping routine, and haven't since I moved. I don't get it. Maybe it's just too much quiet and privacy for my poor little head to comprehend.  God help me if I don't sleep soon. I've been ultra-bitchy the last few days because of it. At least I know it, but still it's nasty and not called for. I remember two years ago around this time, sleep was not even necessary to me. Just didn't even need it. And now? Totally opposite. I don't sleep, I'm not pleasant. Or maybe I wasn't pleasant then, but just didn't realize it. It wouldn't be the first time I didn't realize I was being an evil shrew.  I'm going to go try and sleep. The imperative word in that phrase being 'try'. I'm getting good at trying. Just very poor at doing.  Oh, and for those of you who regularly speak to me and still completely forgot my birthday? The statute of limitations has run out on that. Any belated birthday wishes must be accompanied by a Target gift card. Okay, I'm kidding, but I'm about a $35 gift card away from the MP3 player I want. So much music on my computer needs a place to go. I don't want to delete it, but I don't want it slowing my machine anymore.  Okay now I'm really going to try to sleep. If this week ends and my sleep is still not restful, I'm going for a physical or a pack of Unisom. Please send good sleeping vibes to me if you have any to spare.
