      Cocktales  Jack Quigley’s has resided on State Street for about a year now.  It took place of The Old Bridge Tavern, home of local bikers and legendary locals. The ones everyone talks about, but no one actually drinks with. Unless, you are a true fan of Portsmouth. The walls were tan and decorated with dark green sponge paint. A dirty Budweiser light fixture hung gloomy over a stained pool table.  The bartender looked like an out of work stripper, with hair that was fried like chicken, and a belly made of stretch marks that hung over her stone washed jeans. She had a voice that was piercing, but her smile was genuine, and I appreciated that.  I miss the Old Bridge, it was dirty, but it was real. The drinks were as cheap as they were strong, and I had picked it as a regular spot to start my night. It served as a great break from the average scene of Portsmouth. Average as in the pants of J.Crew and the sounds of Dave Matthews.  It’s been about a year since I have sat on a stool next to a blue collar. Watched cigarette smoke gush between the gaps and imperfections of an honest face. I still sit in that structure, but now it’s all different. Modeled after an old Irish pub, it screams New England prices. And the bartenders are slow to the point where it’s painful.  Cocktail waitresses in lingerie float by on a cloud of cigarette smoke, unscathed by stares of thirsty desperation. Orders are made, and then I’m not sure where these girls actually go to get the drinks, but it must be some far away land. Don’t get me wrong, I like when boys have something to look at. A bar of good looking people is nice. But when I need a drink, give me the hag who’s been on a bar floor for fifteen years.  So, if you can’t count on a stiff drink or decent service, what can you count on? If there are any cute boys in town, this is where a single girl can find them. Walking into Quigley’s is like walking into a damn Abercrombie and Finch ad. Boys with side burns and baseball caps line the bar. They all wear khakis and like things like the Patriots. Easy on the eyes, and even easier to impress. The thing about these kinds of boys is they are all UNH alumni, with those American boy dreams. They want to talk to you, but they don’t know how.  The second plus given to Quigley’s is the Friday night cover bands. Where, Gina works the diner all day, so to speak. And anywhere that happens, is excellent in my little twisted book. A place to dance, while waiting for drinks is key.  I spotted Jeremy in midst of doing my “Ally Sheady.” I was in mid swing when I noticed his green eyes, looking back at me. Jeremy was a cute boy, with a thin frame and sunken in cheeks. Lamb chops lined the sides of his face, and I loved that. His voice was unusually deep and when he smiled, gaps decorated his mouth. He smoked Marlboro Reds and that turned me on. I always appreciate a man who can handle a manly smoke.  In my bed, a small joint came before a long conversation. I tripped over his green eyes and fell right onto his lips. I went from solid to liquid when he kissed me. Our mouths just fit together, like your favorite pair of jeans do. The ones that make your ass look great. He fingered me and moaned in my ear. Licking. Biting. Aching. He told me I was sexy with great conviction. I believed him.  He was a philosophy major, which sounds perfect for me. Perfect on paper, anyway. In reality, the philosophy major, inside the writer, will most likely end in an ego clashing tragedy. He would say “So is life” constantly. This, over time, would surely grate on my nerves.  We made plans.  Waiting. Wanting. Willing. He called me, while I was wearing a dress. He sat at the Scoreboard, a classic lounge of scum bags. As he fed me lines of bullshit, he left my ego starving. He called me the next day, but my principles forced me to ignore him.  I haven’t seen him since. I still think about his mouth. So is life.  -Katie Siska
