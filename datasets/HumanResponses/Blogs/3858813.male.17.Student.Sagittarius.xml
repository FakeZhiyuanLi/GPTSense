      It has been an hour in the making, but I finally finished my cool new picture to fit the whole "cartoon" theme of my website. It took me a while to find a website with a face designer, because everyone knows I am not that much of an artist. I found this one website that was so good, I decided to make all of my friends too. So I shall be asking everyone else to change their profile pictures to the cool new cartoon pictures I made.

      Hello again everyone!  Welcome to the "Viral Cartoon Show", and this is where all the traffic from Kakutama +3 is going to focus for a while. Some of us are still fighting with each other, while the rest of us have moved on.  I am talking about how my sister is still bothering Mute about how he never takes any risks. That is for another time though, back to describing this cool new website.  It is a project at the moment, and Mute shall be joining me soon. He was the first one to jump aboard on my brand new idea for a website. Then when Michelle heard about how Mute was joining me, she decided to tag along. The mysterious Adam (Michelle lives with him) also has started to show some interest in the world of the internet. Maybe he is going to jump on the band wagon also!

      Soon there will be a giant upload of character biographies. Including individual bios there will also be group bios that contain the relationship data of each "couple". So as soon as we get off our lazy asses, and I finish editing Jackie's hack job, then the pictures will be posted along with the information.

      It has been brought to my attention that the first set of cartoon characters I made, were not as good as they should have been. Well, I thought they were fucking awesome, but everyone else said they were crap. So, I remade them again and again, and then another time and finally came up with some good ones.  For some reason Ian and Michelle's characters are the hardest to make. I keep going back to them trying to perfect them to what they actually look like. It is hard, there is something about those two that makes it difficult to put onto paper. Abby, Adam, and I were easy ones to make. I knew exactly what to do with each one.  In a couple days we are going to start doing different things on this website, so get ready for some fun. None of the yelling that occurs on Kakutama +3.

      Adam is joining the ranks of my great website tomorrow. The weird thing is, neither Mute nor I know him personally. I just know him through Mute, whom knows him through Michelle. Yet, it is always great when I meet new people! I welcome him aboard! It looks like my great idea for a website is finally being realized by everyone else from Kakutama +3. It also looks like no one but Abby is posting on it. Looks like everyone has realized who the better of the two Emmons sisters is. The long battle has finally ended and I win.

      After discussing things in a chat room with Jackie, Michelle, and myself. We have all come to the conclusion that we needed a fresh start. Jackie jumped at the idea of having a sister sight to Kakutama +3. I agreed to join her new "cartoonish styled website" under the circumstance that my cartoon character didn't look like a retard. I don't understand why this is called a "cartoon" website in the first place. It is more like, switching profile pictures to cartoon versions and just talking about different things. But, I will not rain on Jackie's juggernaught of a parade. I will just tag along and ride this thing as far as it will take me.  On another note, I have noticed that this website is very... pink. I am unsure why Jackie wants to "pink" it out, when she knows there is going to be two men joining the damn sight. I actually don't care though, she is in control on this one. So if she decides to run it into the ground, it is all her.

      I have been addicted to a game called "Kingdom Hearts" lately. Starting over a couple of times, I finally obtained a file that I did well in. Instead of losing the race in the beginning, I actually won. Now the Gummi Ship is called Excalibur. I win Riku, so you can go cry in a hole somewhere, but not in my Gummi Ship. I don't tolerate that bullshit.

      Jackie is actually speaking to me, which is very wonderful. She asked me if Adam and I wanted to join this new website, and I had nothing better to do so I agreed. I just have to say that I love the color of the website. It is my favorite color in the world and Ian knows that. Anyway, I guess I need to get a cartoon picture of myself too, if I want to be in this little group.

      I guess AVP didn't go over to well. I should have known since they didn't give critics an advance screening like they do with regular movies. I was going to see it, but now I think I would rather drown myself in the puddle outside my window. It sucks that two of the greatest monster franchises ever, were ruined just like that. Actually Aliens were ruined in "Alien Resurrection" and Predator ended at "Predator 2". I don't know who thought a transition from the California governor to Danny Glover would be okay. That is the last fight I want to see, some chump from Lethal Weapon against a creature with an atomic bomb on his wrist, and for some retarded reason Danny Glover seems to win.
