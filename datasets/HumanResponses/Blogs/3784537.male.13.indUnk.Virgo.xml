      Because we all know I'm not Asian so I cannot have a spiffy XaNgA.   Steph's sister is talking to me. She's CrAzY. But now Steph is back. She got the Tootsie Rolls. We have a total night of fun planned. I'm coming over and we're going to eat Tootsie Rolls and watch Degrassi. What fun.   Ooh a commercial for The Secret Window. I saw it at Dylan's, and I must say it is an awesome movie. Somewhat confusing, though. I guess I just need to see it again.  Today, I went biking with Tory and some other chums. Woah I was scared because some guy told us that a guy in a brown car might be following us, and we should watch out and stick together. That was after Adam fell on his bike for the third time. That was funny, but I just wanted to get home. While we were biking, I went the wrong way, so I had to catch up. Me being the slow biker that I am, I could not catch up in time. Where on Earth were they? Thankfully I found them, and Adam said Richard's (I'll tell you about him later)mom flicked them off. Ha. Good thing this was before the guy told us about the brown car. I would've been so fricking scared if that happened after the guy told us about the brown car. I would go CrAzY.  Well, that's enough for now. In a while, crocodiles.

       So that's why I'm back for another wonderful post.  I got my haircut today. I hate them so much. But the lady who cut it actually did a decent job. My mom doesn't care that much about my hair. But my dad just flips out about it. He's just jealous that I have hair and he doesn't. But that means that when I get older. I'm going to bald v_v.. But it's all good. Since I got my haircut now. My hair will be decent when I get my "school pictures." I'm determined to have a decent picture. So I'm going to take you down memory lane and talk about my awful pictures of the past. Kindergarten: I am wearing an incredibly ugly sweater. I'm not smiling. Probably one of my better pictures, actually. First grade: I remember that morning. I was so pissed off, because my mom made me wear this shirt that I hated. And she combed my hair to the side. Once I got to school, I wet it down so it looked better. My hair is kind of sticking out. Not that bad of a picture. But I don't really look like that anymore. So meh. Second grade: Once again, I hardly smiled. And I was wearing YET ANOTHER ugly shirt. Third grade: Well, my clothes are a bit better. But I look like an evil fat ass. Fourth grade: I look fat again. And my hair is ugly. Fifth grade: Eeeeh not too great. Not smiling much. Not much to say about it. Sixth grade: Blech. I was wearing some dumb necklace. And I just look ugly in my opinion. Sixth grade: Gross. I am really pale in this picture, and I look kind of fat =P This picture is just plain all together ugly. So now. Eighth grade will be different. I will have a decent smile (but now it will be a smile filled with braces) and I'm going to make sure I'm not pale. And I'm not fat. So I shouldn't have that problem again. Wow. Paragraphs are my friend.  But why am I talking about school in July? I must stop.  I have been on the computer all most all day. This is pretty sad. And there isn't much to talk about. So I'm out.

      This computer smells.  I was at homestarrunner.com, and it froze.  So I restarted it.  When it was all restarted, the settings were different, and yeah.  The sound wouldn't work.  So I tried to fix it.  No luck.  My sister's boyfriend came down hurr.  He restarted it.  The sound worked!  But AIM didn't.  Restart.  AIM worked.  Sound doesn't.  And he just went on the Internet and looked for crap.  And he left.  So then I restarted it a billion times.  Now AIM and the sound works.  HUZZAH.  But this computert is only like a year and a half old...well I guess it's somewhat my fault for being crappy.  I downloaded iMesh and stuff like that.  But it's just so gosh darn tempting.  And I don't have the money to just go out and buy CDs.  I need one of those jobs kids do like mow the lawn.  But that's a lot of work.  And these cheap ass neighbors probably wouldn't pay me much.  And I also hate mowing.  It is pretty gay.  Also from what I hear, porn isn't good for the computer.  That's not my fault, though.  That's my brother's problem.  I don't look at porn..  And these pop ups are liek fpidsfubs{DGrzgfd[gjoisdbg;KJDF they won't go away.  So I tried to download some pop up stopping crap.  And now, there's some Smiley Central crap in my conversation window on AIM.  I'll just deny it to my brother and sister and say I came out of no where.    I'm watching The Little Rascals (the new one) and it is an awesome movie.  Except that damn Darla is so damn annoying I want to run over her with a lawn mower.  Her voice is really annoying (and sometimes it looks like her lips don't even match the words, like some crappy voice over) and this girl is a bitch.  I want to slap her for being so cruel and annoying.  I mean these nice boys' clubhouse is burning down.  And she sits and watches them trying to rid the flame.  Not trying to help.  Alfalfa has bad taste in girls.  I'm also eating a bunch of candy.  I'm going to get fat.  And I'll be one of those dumb kids I see at Wal-Mart that I hate.  You know, those fat kids that wear ugly clothes.  I know what I mean.  But hey, if I ever got fat, I'd still be as awesome as I am.  I'd just be an uglier awesome kid.  Which brings me to thinking.  I hate how some fat girls/guys want great boyfriends/girlfriends with great sexy bodies.  That's uncool.  What I said didn't really make sense.  But oh well.  I know what I mean.    The Fourth of July is in three days.  And my birthday is in about 2 months (August 30) I hate how my birthday is so close to school.  So I don't look forward so much to my birthday.  Because that means school is about to start.  And that's not good.  I wonder what I shall do for my birthday.  Perhaps I'll go to Valley Fair again.  I typed a lot.  Seeya.
