      People who go tanning don't look attractive... they look stupid.  Why don't you just cut out the middleman and slop some cancer right on your skin?     Pass the cancer, please.   Oh, and another thing...   This is not the Patrick and Sam Variety Hour. Idiotic, drug-induced rantings get real old, real fast (unless i'm making them). So post some content for once. And get haircuts, you crazy hippies.  End transmission.

      This is the way I see things. The name is Galick, Sam Galick. I hear that Patrick is runin the show around here but there is soon going to be a regime change. The world may be corrupt in your eyes but to no avail Operation American Liberation of Patrick Yancy is well under way. My collition leaders will put some whop ass on the Mr. T. Bill Gates the leader or Somolia will head the electronic front. He will make sure every electronic device will have anti-Mr. T ads. Gore will lead up the political end of the cheap deal and the American people will believe him (We believed him when he claimed he invented the internet right?)Dr. Evil will just do his thing I don't know what he does, but he looks evil which will kinda contridicting what i'm trying to get at which is good not evil but anyways.  Muahahahahahahahahahahahah

      For those of you that are new here, this *waves arms around* is a Blog.  It's a weblog. we.. blog. Get it? Neither do i. It still sounds like a naughty word to me.  Anyhoo, this blog here is one of many millions of blogs created by people just like you and me. They allow ordinary people to express their innermost thoughts, dreams, goals, ideas, and experiences, and publish them, for the entire world to read.   At this point, you may ask yourself this question:  WHO CARES?  There are a few different types of blogs. Some are entirely devoted to a certain subject (politics, technology, naval lint collection, etc.) Others are personal blogs, which are, essentially day after day of references to inside jokes that only make sense to around 3 people. Here's an example:   "AverageKid's Personal Blog Monday Hey carl remember ME AND THE CAT ON THE COUCH!!!!!111 HAAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA PINK NUSTS!!!! THIS IS NOT FUNNY TO ANYONE BUT ME AND YOU, BUT I'M WRITING IT HERE TO SHOW OFF THAT I HAVE FRIENDS! This time i'll wear my underwear on the inside!!!!!111"   A message to bloggers everywhere: WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR INSIDE JOKES. TALK ABOUT THEM WITH THE PEOPLE WHO THEY MAKE SENSE TO, THE REST OF THE WORLD COULD NOT GIVE A DAMN.   End Transmission (REMEMBER THE PINK NUFTS LOL ROFTLEMAOAORLDKLA!!).

      I do. I hate it more than anything i've ever hated in my entire life? Why? Because it sucks, that's why. It is the worst movie i've ever not seen in my entire life. For starters, how about Johnny Depp in the previews? HE LOOKS LIKE A TRANSVESTITE! Cut back on the eye shadow and we might talk, Johnny. Another thing: What is the deal with pirates? How come they have to be all "arrr im a swashbuckling pirate yarrrr"?! I mean, seriously, folks. Anyway, I give Pirates of the Carribbean -5 stars out of 5 stars, and strongly recommend that nobody sees, talks about, or even thinks about this god-awful movie on penalty of torturous death by eye-gouging.  YARR, SHE BLOWS!   Pirates of the Carribbean -  (negative five out of five stars)   End Transmission.

      It's some public television travel show. The theme song, however, is particularly good. It starts off and ends with a naturalistic ambient sound, accompanied by that funky Australian aborigine instrument (you know the one i mean), then builds to an interesting synthesized crescendo. Rockin' good fun for all involved.  urlLink Listen here.  You'll need RealOne Player and a decent connection. Unless you don't like this song. Then you really don't need anything.

Okay, so this isn't a monumental leap into the future. I'm not making great strides for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.

      I'm Flick (no, not the kid from A Christmas Story or the bug from A Bug's Life or that duck from PB&J Otter) I've decided I'll post every aspect of my life down to the very last detail for the whole world to enjoy  on second thought, maybe not...  As I sit here, just home from work(a farm, none-the-less) and listening to country music, I've come the realization that I am a hick. What the hell am I doing!? Country music sucks! Actually one song by Travis Tritt called "Country Ain't Country" is pretty good. I'd say go download it but i've heard "the law" has been cracking down on kazaa users lately. Most country music is just too naive and clean or just damn boring.   anyway...i'll be back with more rants in the future  asta la pasta (who cares, it rhymes)

       SCENE: Jim sitting at his computer.   He's slouched in his chair, playing with one of the many empty Vanilla Coke bottles strewn around the room.    Suddenly, he hears it.  Someone has signed on to AIM. In a near-impossible feat of speed, Jim sits up, deftly swooping the cursor to the taskbar and opening the AIM buddy list. With eager anticipation, Jim lobs a casual "Hi" at the person, cleverly disguising his desperate need to alleviate his boredom through social interaction. Prepared to pounce on the keyboard like a tiger and respond in a split-second, Jim waits. And waits. The person ignores Jim and puts up an away message, probably consisting of nonsensical song lyrics or angsty teenage poetry. Jim slumps back in his chair and shakes the Vanilla Coke can above his head to retrieve the precious last drops.    Suddenly, he hears it...    ...And it continues. On the rare occasion that a person responds, that an actual conversation is initiated, the other party discontinues it in short order. This is probably due to    distraction  "OOH! Look at that grass grow! Whoo-eee! This is much more interesting than talking to Jim!"  fear  "Okay, Jim IMs me every single time i get on within a second. That's freaking me out."  revulsion  "Doesn't this loser have anything better to do?"  sympathy  "The poor guy. Maybe if i don't talk to him he might actually get a life." or, last but not least, simple  sadism ! "Heh heh... I know how much Jim wants to talk to me... so i'm just going to ignore him."  So help out an obsessive compulsive AIM user and IM him. Now.  End Transmission. (It's  "NerveStaple" )     NOW LISTENING TO: Rob Dougan - Clubbed to Death (Hybrid Remix)

      Now that i've recovered from camp, i'll give you quick and dirty run-through: spending a week in a tent with another guy and a healthy sampling of blood-sucking, poisonous, and just plain annoying insects. Besides dealing with all of the minimum-wage counselors who hate their jobs, the adult leaders (the parents of other campers... usually their sons are rude, obnoxious, and hateful... and there's nothing you can do about it because, as i said, their parents are there). Mine was an insane  Vietnam war veteran we referred to as "Viet Don". Of course, if he knew that, i would probably already be a bloody corpse in the wilderness of pennsylvania. His son set fire to my tent on more than one occasion. Oh, but there's more. So much more. If you'd like to hear about the escapades of Pool Director Dan, the Pool Director who seems to like little kids a little  too  much, or the  Kid Who Tried To Smoke a Cheeto , i'd be glad to tell you. Right after i go through my post-traumatic stress therapy.  In conclusion, if you are ever offered the exciting opportunity to attend one of these wonderful camps... run. Run and don't look back.

It's the kind of hot that a kind, just and loving god would not allow on this earth. Especially if you don't have air conditioning, like me.   Anyway, i'm back from camp. Besides getting exposed to harmful radiation, i also got a fire ant trapped in my shoe for half an hour. Ouch.  End Transmission.

      A look inside the world of Jim! Instead of crap like "THE ORIGIN OF RICING"!  I've been telling everyone like a pompous ass about my 100 on the physics test, which you've probably heard unless you've been living under a rock or you've stabbed yourself to death after hearing me saying it so many times. I didn't forget any homework. Chicken tenders for lunch. No class seemed to drag on too long. Leftover pizza in the refrigerator when i got home. Amazing days like that are few and far between.  Anyway, I've now fulfilled my legal obligation to talk about shit in my life that nobody really cares about. Back to the good stuff.    Whaaaaat is the deal with people who make sarcastic jokes and then retract them immediately after they make them? I'll bring out my good friend SomeLoser to demonstrate this absolutely annoying trait.      SomeLoser:  so anywayz  NerveStaple: yeah? what's up  SomeLoser:  i gained 300 pounds today.  NerveStaple:  hehe  SomeLoser:  no i really didn't, i'm sorry.  The only way to properly describe my feelings at this point is to use the following phrase:     WTF?!?!?!!!!!?!       Seriously, people. You don't need to dumb down your jokes for the benefit of the ignorant. If someone doesn't get it through their thick skull that the completely outrageous and wacky thing you're saying in a SARCASTIC TONE OF VOICE is SARCASTIC, then they deserve to get the wrong impression.  And I hate you all. Not really, i'm sorry.  End Transmission.

NerveStaple:  same.   long period of silence until someone signs off     Even attempts to answer the dreaded "nm u" with something that actually is up will result in failure.     SomeLoser:  nm u?  NerveStaple:  I climbed mount everest, was shot out of a cannon to the moon, and developed a cure for cancer.  SomeLoser:  k   long period of silence until someone signs off     Your online relationship with this person can be considered in cardiac arrest.

      Seriously. This has got to stop. You don't seem to understand that I know that you're not wearing pants. The weeks of emails, IMs, phone calls, telegrams, letters, and skywriting messages have drilled it into my brain.   I know that you're not wearing pants. That's not the problem, though. The problem is that I don't care. The fact that you're not wearing pants presents no interest to me whatsoever. It frightens me that you seem to think that I, and the rest of the world, has an extreme interest in the clothed-ness of your lower half.   Now that that's out of the way, Why The Hell Aren't You Wearing Pants? If it's a comfort issue, i'm sure you could have found at least one pair of leggings that you are inclined towards. If you're trying to make a political statement, i'm also sure that you could have found a better way to express yourself. If you just felt like it, that's your personal prerogative. But don't you think you could have found a better place to take off your pants than in the middle of an airport? Sooner or later, someone's going to try and stop you. And it might just be me, if you tell me one more time that you're not wearing any pants.  Don't say it. You've pushed me to the edge.  End Transmission.

      Returning home after a long and hot summer day, sweaty and thirsty, I peered into the refrigerator and grabbed the nearest can of soda. Digging my nails under the tab and pulling it up resulted in the normal, satisfying sound.  However, there was nothing normal about  this  can of soda. Completely unaware of the horrors about to befall me, i put it up to my lips and began to suck down the liquid. What passed over my tongue I can honestly say was the worst-tasting thing i have ever consumed. Ever. I promptly spewed it all over the room, almost vomiting, and rushed to the sink to attempt to wash the taste off, but it only made it stronger. It went down my throat like sewer slime and sat in my stomach like a lead weight. After I recovered, thoughts went through my head: Who would make such a horrible, horrible ooze and market it as an drinkable product? What the hell was it? I picked up the half-empty can and read the label: "Cel-Ray Celery Soda."  I read it again. Celery. Soda.  Celery.  For god's sake, look, and i mean really  look  at what you're getting the next time you reach in the fridge.  Oh, and apparently Anna is God's gift to men. And available. And holding a gun to my head.   Celery. What the fuck.   End Transmission.

      Whoa.  I'm not sure what that last post was all about.  I'll just pretend it didn't happen.     Anyway, I've noticed a disturbing trend in my posts of late... they all lack a certain something. I'm sure you all (all three of you who read this) have noticed it also. They all lack one thing: namely, ME.  You look at Jimbo and questions run through your head. How does he work? What makes him tick? Why am I thinking these questions when i have no idea who he is and don't care at all?  So tape your eyeballs open, strap yourself to the computer and prepare to be devastated by my brain-seeking word bombs.     I can't remember anything. It's not serious enough to be a disorder, but it's bad enough that it screws up things. Most people take for granted being able to remember their schedules, or their homework, or what they had for breakfast. The worst feeling is being punished just because i couldn't remember to do my homework, or even if i do do my homework, bring it in to school.  "You need to work harder, Jim. This homework situation is unacceptable."  How the fuck is working harder going to help me remember to bring in my homework? In what fantasy world does the amount of work i put into an assignment have any impact on whether i remember to bring it in or not?  I wish that was the worst part, but it's not. The worst part is walking somewhere... and suddenly realizing that i have no idea what i just did or what i'm about to do. I can usually grasp some memory fragment floating around and figure it out... but it's scary.     So, the next time you see me, give me all your money, shave your head and submit to the all-powerful will of your new God, Jimbo. Or you could uh... not. And run away fast.  .noissimsnarT dnE

         Vote for me!  I'll fight for the rights of women, gays, and minorities!    But I'll jack up taxes, entangle you with dozens of stupid nitpicky little laws, and violate your rights in order to protect you from yourself.    OR     Vote for me!  I'll lower taxes and protect you from the liberals trying to take away your privacy and freedom of expression.   Unless, of course, you abuse this freedom and privacy by being a homosexual, a feminist, a minority, or in any other way fail to conform to our idea of how our God wants you to be.

      A head-to-head match-off between the two most contentious rivals in the world of dairy...   CARTON MILK  versus  PLASTIC JUG MILK     POINT: CARTON MILK      To begin, I’d like to thank Jimtopia for the opportunity to make my views heard. Here and now, I will erase any preconceived notions you had about milk from a carton by convincing you of its many benefits. While I agree with my opponent on the subject of milk itself, where we differ is on the delivery… All property relations in the past have continually been... He seems to think that a plastic jug provides a more efficient conveyance for the dairy, and this is simply not the case.  1 -  Storage.  Carton milk, with its standard rectangular prism shape, is perfect for stacking and storage without hassle. Plastic Jug milk, however, has rounded edges, and when combined with sweating (see point 3) makes for a very unstable milk-stacking structure.  It’s time to leave the stone age of milk conveyance!  Join the exodus unto the future of that white, gland-fresh substance we call milk.    2 -  Rigidity.  The pyramidal hood on all Carton milk gives it a rigidity of form that simply cannot be had from the malleable plastic material of Plastic Jug milk.  3 -  Condensation and Absorbency.  The state-of-the-art hybrid paper/cardboard/wax alloy of which Carton milk is made provides maximum absorbency of condensation, giving you, the drinker, a firmer grip on your milk conveyance. Plastic Jug milk condensation simply gathers on the outside, making a mess and a slippery situation.  There’s plenty to cry over when your spilled milk accidentally trips up a loved one.    4 -  Ease of Use.  Simply put, Carton milk utilizes what people in my profession like to call "Immediate Drinkability," or "Buy 'n Drink." It helps move milk, as a drink, out of the past and into the 21st Century; thus, moving the beverage down the consumer’s esophagus, and, eventually, back into the 21st Century once more. Its easy to use lid allows the drinker to swallow his or her milk most effectively.  As opposed to the archaic and obsolete design of Plastic Jug milk, the carton of milk’s “lidless” lid follows closely the Euclidean derivation of a 36-degree angle (accept no substitutes!).  Would you really want to drink something out of anything but a golden ratio?   The four points above, along with many more that have not been published here (environmental factors, ease of production, and cost of materials), should sway you and your buying decisions toward Carton milk – the Superlative Milk Conveyance of the 21st Century!   COUNTER-POINT - PLASTIC JUG MILK      That absurdly gracious, “carton-milk introduction” aside (an obvious ploy), I believe that it is time that the American people experience the truth.  For only then can any real, positive change be affected in the fight against the red and white, pasteurized specter that is Carton milk.    Carton milk is an obvious tool of the Communist and is a mere trifle in its eventual goal of the total and complete enslavement of the proud American people. Pay no heed to the traitorous lies you see above you, for they contain many subliminal messages inserted by the Stalinist lords of Carton milk. The obvious red color scheme of Carton milk clearly displays its roots in Godless Communism, along with its mind-warping "images" and “designs,” so obviously designed to purposefully cloud the senses and rational thought, leaving the viewer unaware of the twisted mental and ideological messages being inserted into his or her mind. The material from which Carton milk is made does not originate from America or even America's Heartland, Mexico. Nay, it is produced in foreign nations—that’s right: Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea, China! I am willing to forgive this fact, that Carton milk originates in the vast, evil region, because many goods we all use do, and that’s OK, because most goods are not insidious threats to our God-loving society. However, it is obvious to anyone with the will to overcome the evil, medusa-like tendrils of Carton milk already influencing and warping our society, that with the production of Carton-paper in these countries will eventually lead to the collapse of the proud capitalist tradition of the US, leaving it wide open for Communist overthrow. Finally, the chemical lacing on every carton of Carton milk is a godless cocktail of drugs designed to leave the mind open for ideological conversion to Communism, along with radioactive markers so that you can be tracked from outer space (if this purported "outer space" exists, and is not another Marxist myth).  Remember: Every time you buy Carton milk, it's like punching an American baby in the stomach and setting his or her toys on fire.

         STEP ONE:  Have an appealing color scheme. Dark grey text on a black background works, black text on a black backround is even better. As an alternative, choose neon green text over a flashing yellow background. When your eyes begin to scream in pain, you know you've got it right. (NOTE: Change your color scheme every day. It's hardcore.)   STEP TWO:  Make a profile. For your picture, put a picture of another person, or an object that has nothing to do with you. If the picture must be of you, try to make it of your eye, ear, or other single body part. Extra points go to pictures that are completely out of focus.     For "Location", put something absolutely crazy and wild, like "Albania", "Antarctica", or "Zimbabwe." HAHA! It's funny because it's not the country you really live in! CRAZY!   STEP THREE:  The content. Make sure posts have no punctuation or line breaks. This makes them much easier to read. And remember, this is the Internet, so spelling doesn't matter. (NOTE: Insert some spelling errors if there aren't any. It's hardcore.)   Posts should be extremely detailed: "lol likk so me n kris wer gona go to da malll but i was lik nuh uh bitch and tehn she wass all up in mah face n shitz but so i then it lik wha? an no way n stuf likk dat an lololol omgomgomg tehn i lik talkd ta her agian an it was awsom cuz she dint lik him but i did sooo..."  ...Or extremely short: "2day we went to da mall n shitz. teh end!!1"  Now, you want to ensure that as many people as possible can easily read and understand your writing. To do this, you must master the art of  Inside Jokes .  Confuse! Annoy! An easy way to not write a lot of shit, because it's hard! Make almost everyone feel inferior because they're not in on the joke!   BE HARDCORE: USE INSIDE JOKES!    If you have friends, and do things with them, then you can make an inside joke. Example: if you all went to the movies and something totally hardcore happened, simply mention the movies. Do not, under any circumstances, explain what happened.  RIGHT: "LOL REMEBER DA MOVIEZ GUYZ!1"  WRONG: "On saturday, my friends and i went to the movies. We tried to sneak in, but it didn't work. Then we started making fun of the movie employees."

      Overpopulation. Starvation. Poverty. Murder. Rape. Hate. Fear. Pain.  Wouldn't it be great if we could do away with it all?  Well, rest assured, fellow citizens: Jim Labs is working around the clock toward a foolproof solution to all of these problems.  AND YOU CAN HELP!              Funds transfered to Jim Labs Offshore Holding Account have no guarantee of being used toward ending the universe.   "How," you ask, "could 'Jim Labs' possibly be able to pull off this amazing feat?" you might also ask: "Isn't 'Jim Labs' just you and your crappy computer in a sewing room with poor lighting and lots of dirty laundry?"  To the latter question, I would most likely respond with wit and cunning, something to the effect of shouting "YOUR MOTHER!" or curling up into a fetal position and crying like a little girl.  To the former, however, I would simply say:  "Destroy the Universe."   To which you would most likely respond by bludgeoning me to death with the nearest heavy object before my horrible horrible designs could be unleashed upon existence, or, possibly, screaming, "ARE YOU INSANE?"  Sanity has nothing to do with it. We here at Jim Labs  (allegations of Jim Labs simply being Jim McGee in a sewing room with a crappy computer and poor lighting and dirty laundry are completely unfounded and repetition of these slanderous lies will most likely end you up in a federal penitentiary with a 250-pound cell mate they call 'The Shredder')  believe staunchly in the righteousness of our cause, and are working day in and day out to bring an end to the failed experiment known as 'Existence'.     One of Jim Labs' many state-of-the-art Research and Development facilities across North America    SOME OF OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES:   Elimination By Logical Contradiction and/or Paradox    Our most ambitious effort, the Jim Labs Paradox Division has a specially trained team of mathematicians (volunteer precalculus students), along with physicists, engineers, and our esteemed Project Director, Dr. Emmett Brown.      MATHEMATICS:  Prove that 1=0. Existence=Nothingness. Maybe while the seams of reality are unraveling around him, my math teacher will finally admit he graded my midterm wrong. That'll show him. Or maybe we could divide something by zero. Or trick the universe into taking the square root of a negative number. We're not really sure... most of the staff has been busy studying for midterms.   TIME TRAVEL:  Doctor Brown has a vested interested in this project, being the inventor of the world-famous Flux Capacitor. Armies of our staff are presently engaged in traveling backwards in time, in order to have sex with/kill their relatives before they are born. Sickening, but all's fair in love, war, and toying with the fabric of space and time.  (The brave employees of Jim Labs who attempted to travel back in time and prevent the Big Bang from occuring came back with nothing but failure. And really, really bad sunburn.)   PHILOSOPHY:  We've put two monkeys trained in basic language skills and metaphysics, in a room with a stack of bananas, with the axiom "I Think, Therefore I Am." And we're not letting them out until they disprove existence.    A Really Gigantic Bomb No, really. It's Frickin' Huge. Enormous. Immense.    Nothing much more to say about this strategy. This explosive device will have the destructive capacity of one hundred bajillion gazillion nuclear bombs. There won't be much left of the universe except for space cockroaches. If they exist. Which we're almost certain they do. And then, the Really Gigantic Bomb Mark II (it's Destructarrific!) will take care of them.   We're starting with some firecrackers and bottle rockets, and working our way up. That is, if we didn't use them all to blow up frogs.  Um. Next strategy.    Waiting for the End of The Universe    This is our fail-safe plan. Modern cosmological theories indicate that the universe will eventually die, whether by collapsing in on itself or expanding into nothingness. It works, but... we're impatient. And bored. So shut up, stupid.    Pretending It's Not There    Some scientists have stated that things don't exist unless we observe them. So, Jim Labs has started a grass-roots and major-media campaign in order to organize the entire populace of the world to Ignore Reality.   What's YOUR strategy? Comment, and you might just have hit upon the perfect plan. The lives of 7 billion people hang in the balance... let's end it now.  End Transmission.

                 The staff of Jimtopia congratulates Evil Senator John Kerry on his victorious conquering of the Commonwealth of Iowa. We are confident that the Kerry campaign, the unstoppable juggernaut of the Democratic primaries, will continue blasting its way through the rest of the country. Bringing his dream of a never-ending reign of unbridled carnage and suffering to the rest of America will be difficult, but in the end, we are sure he will succeed.    NEWS BULLETIN: At a recent rally, Senator Kerry paused from gnawing on raw human flesh and mutilating defensless kittens to announce,    "KNEEL TREMBLING BEFORE YOUR NEW LORD AND MASTER FOR ALL ETERNITY. BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO ME, SO THAT I MAY DEVOUR THEIR SOULS AND LIVE FOREVER. MY ARMIES OF RADIOACTIVE SUPERMEN WILL MARCH TO SLAY ALL WHO OPPOSE ME. BEHOLD: KERRY, THE NEW FACE OF PAIN."   He then cackled maniacally to resounding applause, afterwords giving autographs and greeting the public.   Senator Kerry is expected to make attempts to lift the ban on human cloning if he is elected, along with several child abuse statutes and anti-cannibalism legislation.

      Anna Breslaw is the Prince of Darkness. She lurks about and is crafty. She fills us with the pessimistic thoughts, the bad thoughts, the hateful thoughts. She shows us all the hurts, frustration and troubles of this world and of our own lives, hoping to lead us to despair.  Throughout Sacred Scripture, we find mention of 'Anna Breslaw', the devil. The name 'Anna Breslaw' comes from the Hebrew word 'Brezlow', meaning to oppose, to harass someone; so 'Anna Breslaw' would be the tempter, the one to make up trip and fall, the one to turn us from God. Her name is also derived from the Greek 'brezlos', meaning an accuser, a slanderer. Other synonyms for 'Anna Breslaw' in Sacred Scripture are the Evil One, Beelzebub, the Accuser, the Tempter, the Great Dragon and the Ancient Serpent.  Given these titles and roles, it is little wonder that Christian art has depicted Anna Breslaw as an ugly, horrible beast with horns. Even in the morality plays of the Middle Ages, Anna Breslaw could appear in disguise but was always recognized by her limp, a sign of her fall from heaven.

      Recently it has come to my attention that liberal feminists have opened their next front upon this very website; Jimtopia.  I will not stand for this unjust turn of events.  I shall die for Jimtopia, as I was made from Jimtopia.  I will not let my mind be manipulated by such liberal propaganda or suggestions such as the addition of an X chromosome to this website.  Bitch: the New Deal act was diagonal and you know it.    "Get to know two things about a man. How he earns his money and how he spends it. You will then have the clue to his character. You will have a searchlight that shows up the inmost recesses of his soul. You know all you need to know about his standards, his motives, his driving desires, his real religion."  And if Anna spends her money on booze and porn, I think it says everything we need to know.

      "And then Jim said, 'Let an X-chromosome infiltrate Jimtopia and shine some light through the testosterone-induced haze we live in.' And then there was estrogen. And it was good." By the way,  does anybody know which New Deal act was the "vertical one" as opposed to the AFL's "horizontal?" Was it the CIO, the NIRA or the NLRA?  We have a test tomorrow, and I'm so screwed if I can't find this in my notes before fifth period. Nobody in my class seems to know. Dumb fuckers. On the bright side, it's going to snow tomorrow.

      I realize that nothing I say matters to anyone else on the entire planet. My opinions are useless and unfocused.  I am an expert in nothing.  I know nothing.  I am confused about almost everything. I cannot, as an individual, ever possibly know everything, or even enough to make editorial commentary on the vast vast majority of things that exist in my world.  This is a stupid document; it is meaningless drivel that I do not expect any of the several billion people on my planet to actually read.  People who do read my rambling, incoherent dumbfuckery are probably just as confused as I am, if not moreso, as they are looking to my sorry ass for an opinion when they should be outside playing Frisbee with their dog or screwing their life partner or getting a dog or getting a life partner.  Anyone who actually takes the time to read my bullshit probably deserves to ingest my fucked up and obviously mistaken opinions on whatever it is that I have written about.

      On the rare instances that my dreams are interesting, and i remember them (very rarely), they go here. Hey, i need to do something with all my time when i'm avoiding my homework... This one i had while sleeping over Conor's house...   So i'm sitting at the beach. I think it's on Long Beach Island. I'm sitting on the dock with one other person who i don't know, and we're watching the bay. It's a normal summer day (only oddly dark), the clouds are floating by, and suddenly one cloud starts to form into what looks exactly like a nuclear mushroom cloud. Then, suddenly, a real nuclear bomb explodes and an identical-looking mushroom cloud appears right next to it. Somehow i know it's real. Then the shock wave hits, i die, and wake up.   Thoughts: Could be meaningless, as i spent alot of time unleashing nuclear armageddon upon the world in a computer game during the day. On the other hand, it could be revealing some deep-seated thoughts in my unconscious. Anyone want to pick my brain with an amateur psychoanalysis? Leave a comment.  (PS - If someone says that this dream means i'm actually gay, i hate you.)  End Transmission.

(119,  The Concept of Irony ).  The tragic hero expresses the universal and sacrifices himself for it.  The sectarian punchinello, instead of that, has a private theatre, i.e. several good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the beadles in  The Golden Snuffbox  represent justice (164,  Fear and Trembling and Sickness Unto Death )

       Let's face facts, you're getting hoovier.  Not only are you getting hoovier, I mean,  really  hoovier, you also have no idea what to do about this hooviness.  Well I'm here to tell you all today that there's a new place where you can meet hoovy people like yourself and just have a good time.  It's a blog called  You're Getting Hoovier  and it's GREAT.  It worked wonders on my aunt, who after using the site for just one week quickly lost 120 lbs.  But !HEY! don't take it from me, try it for yourself FREE OF CHARGE for the next twenty-five years.  If you're not satisfied with your hooviness, try ephedra or even better try methamphetamines, they work too.  In fact, if I had to quantify the  You're Getting Hoovier  experience with some non-hoovy substance, I would use methamphetamines, perhaps even freebase cocaine...but, again, don't take it from me...visit the  You're Getting Hoovier  patented system at  urlLink hoovier.blogspot.com , and join the millions already taking part in this dangerous moral experiment.

       Chris Peters - Senior War Correspondant   STAND BACK. BACK I SAY. I have come. What is it that I have come for you ask? Well it’s complicated (too complicated for many) for I am the new War editor of Jimtopia. I report on all the crap weather it be secret Iraqi movements(I will tell you the correct pronunciation later) to the ever raging war between the evil Jug Milk radicals and the good non communists, non brain stealing, regular tasting cardboard milk. Now you’re thinking this is going to suck just like everything else on Jimtopia, right. Well you probably are right. So listen to my crap because I know all. You don’t get a position like War editor on Jimtopia by doing nothing in your life. I know all.  Enough about that other crap I was saying. Now let’s get down to the dealings of me, and me only.  I believe you all know about the groundhog and how he saw his shadow. Well many credible sources including myself, have determined that the Ground Hog and the Iraqi’s are related. How are they related you ask? Well for one, they both had to be smoked out of their dirty spider caves like the primal beasts they are. That means there the same horrible bests who posses the power to corrupt all. Many of you have previously thought that the ground hog was a medieval best that was primarily used to determine the length winter. Well fact actually is that the groundhog has been playing you common folk for many a year, playing you like spoons in fact. The truth is that the ground hog is an evil device used to spy on the types of car we use, that way they can determine the price of oil. Now you scream with rage about what I’ve told you. Well don’t go crazy like a certain Jug Milk sympathizer I know. (You know who I’m talking about) I have a plan. I have a great plan that’s even better than actually making a low fat type of food that actually tastes like food. My plan is to send all of our Nuclear Titan missiles to Iraq and blow them up. This will kill of the Iraqi people and possibly any other type of ground animal living there, unless these ground animals live in a really deep spider cave, at which point they must be smoked out of their holes and brutally blown to pieces. After we are done blowing up stuff we will be free to steal the oil thus cutting gas prices by 60%, saving people an average estimated sum of 3 dollars a year. We will be able to use these three dollars to spend on the stock market and make it good again. See it’s a win-win situation for all. Don’t you wish all War reporting was as informative as this.

          Conor:  10  Asteroid:  11   WINNER: THE ASTEROID FROM 'ARMAGEDDON'   The asteroid coasts silently through space at 20,000 miles an hour. Conor looks up at the sky, seeing the bright silouette of the rock bear directly on him. He moves into a fighting stance. The asteroid hits Earth's atmosphere several miles above Conor, burning it instantly into superheated plasma. The sky above Conor lights up as the asteroid barrels toward him. The deafening noise of sonic booms pierce his ears. The instant before the rock hits the ground, Conor swings a punch with all his might.  The asteroid slams into Conor, immediately vaporizing him. It shatters Earth's crust with the impact force of millions of thermonuclear explosions. The cloud it throws into the air blankets the entire world, killing all life. When the dust settles, Conor is little more than a fine powder scattered evenly over a cold and lifeless Earth.  Tough break.   COMING UP: CONOR VERSUS CONOR

He staggers, then falls. With his final ounce of strength, he gazes up at the triumphant face of Misha, his foot resting on Conor's slain body.  Better luck next Grudge Match, Conor.

      I like the concept of the AIM "Block," allowing you to avoid annoying people without them knowing that you're doing so.  Just imagine if you could have a "Block List" in real life... Who's on yours?

      Okay, that does it. I'm unbelievably sick of the word "random." "We  randomly  did..." "That's SO  random ..." "We were being really  random ..."  Random this. Random that.  ENOUGH! I will personally castrate   the next person who I hear use "random" in casual conversation.  For those of you with a need to describe a situation "having no specific pattern, purpose, or objective," I present the following alternatives:  -aimless -arbitrary -casual -erratic -fluky -haphazard -impromptu -incidental -irregular -purposeless -slapdash   Really. Any one of these will do. Just please, for the love of god, stop over-using "random" before you're drawn and quartered by crazed statisticians.   (To all those who  will  comment using the word "random" thinking they're hilarious, clever little shits: fuck you and the liberal horse you rode in on.)

      The newly released "Art Film" by rising actor/director  urlLink Johnathan Zamboni  is truly one of the definitive films of this generation. This gripping political thriller provides an intriguing and controversial perspective on American culture in post-9/11 society. The improvised narrative (the voice of Mr. Zamboni himself) chronicles the story of Quentin Azara (also played by Zamboni). Quentin, a former Israeli military commando-turned FBI agent struggles to discover a chilling and ancient conspiracy within the upper echelons of the US government, and eventually, discover himself. Watching the interplay between the colorful cast and rich, complex plot is a joy. By the first five minutes, you can be completely absorbed and entranced by the story as it follows Quentin around the globe - from Cairo to Cherynobl. Quentin's monologue at the foot of one of Cherynobl's monolithic cooling towers is especially transfixing, and a performance that will be remembered for some time.  This movie will appeal to all types of people and all age groups - there's something here for everyone. Side-splitting comic relief is provided by Quentin's devil-may-care partner, Toronto Horowitz (also played by John Z. in true Sellers-esque fashion, with a little help from technical wizardry). Toronto's performance, while hilarious, does sometimes detract from the weighty subject matter of the film. This negative is the only point that kept "Art Film" from getting a full 5 out of 5 stars. Still, from the explosive beginning to the thrilling climax, "Art Film" is sure to transfix and satisfy - a definite must-see.   "ART FILM":   (four and one half out of five stars)

          Conor:  7  Conor:  7   WINNER: NEITHER   Conor turns a corner. He sees him. At the other end of the long, empty street is Conor's quarry. Their eyes lock. A chilled silence fills the air, broken only by Conor cracking his knuckles. In a flash, they leap foward and run to eachother. Leaving a wake of old newspapers and other refuse, Conor and Conor plow toward eachother at near-inhuman speeds, their eyes filled with murderous rage. As they collide, they are both instantly converted into pure energy. The resulting explosion and shock wave levels the surrounding city for miles, leaving even more of the surrounding area uninhabitable due to radiation for centuries. Conor and his duplicate are now only echoes in a barren wasteland.   THIS CONCLUDES THE GRUDGE MATCH SERIES (FOR NOW)

      To :  nervestaple@msn.com  Subject :  business c o operation     For The Attention of: OWNER / CHIEF EXECUTIVE  This is for your urgent attention.  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.  My name is KEN AMOBI, a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country, the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also retired.  In its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and company's information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairman’s official study, which he left behind in his office.  Going through some of the files left behind by the former chairman, we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence, we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office, this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.  I am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your company's name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this, we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your company's name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter.  For your participation and investing in this project, we are prepared to concede 25%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project, we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.  I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval, please respond immediately.  Endeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.   KEN AMOBI

      There are those who accept the beliefs of people of authority (Jesus, God, Buddha, Parents, George Bush, John Kerry), then find arguments as to why they believe what they do.  There are those who listen to all possible arguments, then attempt to make a rational decision about what they believe.  We've all heard this. Despite this, even the most closed-minded who have heard it simply apply it to those around them (ignoring that they are the very ones the advice is trying to help), and continue to live in ignorant bliss. My obsession has become to reach total internal consistency - having a belief system based upon complete objective, rational thought. The problem is, I can't stop. Constantly questioning everything I believe leads to thought spirals that don't stop until my brain hurts. Maybe nobody can truly live up to the ideal, yet I've been trying to. It's incredibly difficult to form an opinion in this state of mind. I can't truly "believe" anything, I'm always waiting for more data. When I argue with people, it's always from a detached, playful standpoint; I don't actually believe what I'm arguing for. I get especially confused when thinking about my stance on controversial political issues. With two sources of data, each polarized heavily toward each side, I not only have to question what the data means, but where it's coming from. (The Liberal Media, The Right-Wing Media)  It may be that being ignorant and simply assuming a certain belief is a necessary evil. I see people all the time, everywhere, who walk around with complete and total inner peace, completely assured that  their  beliefs are the right one. (Note: this is why I find I fit to the philosophy of "liberalism" rather than "conservativism" - extremists on both sides make the same closed-minded mistake of not thinking about their beliefs rationally (you could also argue that extremist liberals are actually conservatives with a different set of beliefs (this will be the third nesting of parenthesis), but a true "liberal," by definition, will be open-minded and analyze all their beliefs rationally).  Not to get too "Philosophy 101," but could it be that there is no such thing as completely objective truth?  That was fun. Maybe I can get a frontal lobotomy, and my mind will stop making endless "pro" and "con" lists whenever i have to make any minor decision.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.blogsnow.com/

      At 3:53 in the AM, preparing to go to Long Beach Island at about 8AM, I suddenly have a realization.  Not many things piss me off. Despite Misha's best efforts, it's incredibly difficult to annoy me in any way, shape or form. However, one thing absolutely must end. Tonight.  I can't even explain my blind hatred for this phenomenon, or exactly what it is. Maybe someone can express it better than I can. It's nicknames. Yes, nicknames. I don't hate the people with the nicknames, or the nicknames themselves. Maybe it's the people who give the nicknames. I don't really know. Some don't tick me off, some make my blood boil.  "Termie" - Whenever someone says this, i get a vivid mental image of thousands of termites with little Conor heads all writhing in a nest deep in a piece of old, wooden furniture. Is it really that fucking hard just to say "Terminator"?  "Meatball" and "Sandwich" I'm not even sure who these nicknames belong to. I think one of them might be Justin. I'm so angry right now, I can't even pin down what I hate about them. Maybe it's the fact that they sound so incredibly artificial and forced. It sounds like they were named by a corporate focus group, trying to be "cool."  This sub-par entry disappointed me. I think you really deserve something better after all these days of silence. Remind me to make it up to you guys with obsessive posting this summer.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.popvssoda.com/countystats/total-county.html

      I remembered some of my dream from last night. All you amateur psychoanalysts, give this one a go:   I am shot in the bellybutton with a pistol. I feel it enter my body and lodge itself inside. Eventually, I work up the strength to reach in my hand to pull it out, but it has grown to the size of a large rifle shell. Every time I reach for it, it slips inbetween my stomach and liver, and I feel them get pushed out of the way. I remain very calm throughout this. (I can't remember where I was and what I was doing while this all happened) At the end of the dream, the pointy bullet tip is sticking out of my bellybutton. I reach for it and it shrinks back inside.        info.link:&nbsp; urlLink http://www.astrobio.net/news/article966.html

      It's come to the point where I can't ignore it anymore - I need to start seriously thinking about colleges and careers.  urlLink The Short List  was off the top of my head and a bit optimistic. Right now the two colleges that are really interesting me are University of Chicago and Rice University in Texas.  I also found the most kick-ass scholarship ever... the  urlLink National Security Agency  offers full-ride scholarships each year for Math, Engineering, and Foreign Languages, as long as you agree to work for them for a few years after college as an Intelligence Analyst. Hell, I'd want to work for the NSA even if they didn't give me a scholarship.  I might need to eliminate all independent thought before I submit to be a tool of the Man, though.

      My goal in life is to become immortal. (I'm using immortal in the context of 'not having a limited lifespan') Or, failing that, at least find a way to extend my lifespan significantly. I agree that it is a far-fetched goal, but technology does have 80 or 90 years to develop before I run out of time. Besides real, physical immortality, there are other options, as well.   Downloading my brain to a computer is more realistic, but brings up the tricky problem of souls and consciousness. If the pattern of electrical impulses and neurons in my brain were 'scanned' and transformed into a digital simulation, would "I" still exist? Would "I" die, only to have another digital person born within the simulation?  If all else fails, I'd at least want to be cryonically frozen. Despite the major problem of cryonics (water in cells and blood freezing, expanding, and breaking cells and capillaries - essentially, freezer burn), there are workarounds being studied, such as quickly replacing body water with other chemicals. Even if it hasn't improved, I've got a better chance of being revived if I'm frozen than if I'm a rotting skeleton.  Another, more radical strategy for living forever comes to mind - time-traveling into the future. Despite common conception, time travel to the future is quite easy and feasible - it is time travel to the past that is considered impossible. One may travel to any arbitrary point in the future simply by exploiting time dilation in special relativity. If you were to embark on a journey of several years on a space ship with reasonable acceleration (one that will most likely be invented in our time), several hundred years would go by on earth. The point of all this, of course, is to eventually reach a time in which medical technology has advanced far enough to prevent death from old age. The downside to traveling into the future is that it's a one-way trip - so if you travel 500 years into the future only to discover Earth has gone through a nuclear war, leaving only dust and cockroaches - tough luck.       Evolutionary explanations for things have always interested me. Many people consider death to be a process inherent in biological organisms - this is not the case. If a creature had evolved in such a way that immortality was beneficial to its survival, it would not die of old age. The reason for death, then, is that we become useless to our genes once we reproduce. Evolutionarily speaking, the purpose of any living thing is to reproduce. In humans, reproductive age spans from about 12-45. Notice that there are no large-scale diseases endemic to that age group - this is because we have evolved safeguards against diseases that prevent us from reproducing. If one did not have these safeguards, it would not live to reproduce, and thus not pass on its faulty genes. Those humans that evolved protection against diseases  during reproductive age  did reproduce, and passed on those protections.  After humans pass reproductive age, any mutations that cause disease or decay the human body are allowed to continue on, as they have no impact on reproduction. For example, if a mutation is introduced in a person that causes cancer at age 65, it will not interfere with their child-bearing, as they have already had children (or the opportunity to have children). Death from old age is simply these mutations collecting, growing, and piling up over time, decaying the body.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.tastycicada.com/  how i died today:  urlLink crushed into a quantum singularity   [Listening to: Cocaine -  urlLink JJ Cale  (02:50)]

I purport that people lack both the aformentioned "will," intelligence, and moral consistency to rule themselves. Rather, the most successful republican governments attempt to create a system of government that overcomes our shared human flaws.

      Another one of my many goals for the summer is to experience "lucid dreaming." Normally, a dream is experienced something like watching a movie or acting from a script. Lucid dreaming changes the dream experience into something more like being a god.   Essentially, a lucid dream is achieved when one realizes that they are dreaming within the dream, but do not wake up. This allows the dreamer to take control of his or her "dream world" or "dreamscape." A major road block on my journey to lucid dreaming is my horrible memory, especially related to dreams. I'm getting better, though.   There are lots of strategies for training yourself to stay lucid in dreams, the one I'm trying now is to associate a symbol with the fact that I'm dreaming. I've also learned apparently hands become distorted or fuzzy in dreams, along with the fact that writing often changes  - so I thought of this little trick:      wow, my hands are hot     If I happen to glance at my hands in my dreams, I'm hoping that I'll notice that this is changed or gone completely.  If you've been reading any of my "serious" posting recently, you'd probably get the feeling that I don't know myself very well, psychologically speaking. I've also been feeling a bit impotent (still psychologically speaking, assholes) - that none of my decisions matter, that I can't even make decisions into the first place. So, what better method to achieve self-understanding and control of my life than physically exploring and taking control of my own subconscious mind?

      I can't stand leap years. Therefore, I propose that the US Government fund a project to build a Really Gigantic, Expensive Rocket Engine pointing straight up somewhere on the equator. This rocket will be the size of a city, with the pushing force of over 11 trillion horsepower (with optional leather interior, to boot). The R-GERE will fire at midnight every night as it points straight away from the sun. Several years of this will push the Earth closer to the sun, decreasing the length of our year from 365.265 days to 365 days. Or, if we're feeling really ambitious, we can keep it going longer and get it down to 360 days, so we don't have to remember that stupid damn "Thirty Days Have November..." rhyme or however the hell it goes. It doesn't even rhyme right.  Anyway, once we're done screwing with Earth's orbit, the R-GERE's immense and unimaginable power could be used to further other noble causes, such as:   Crashing the Moon into the Earth, for kicks   Souping up a Honda Civic   3-D Planetary Pool    "Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun."

      On these lazy summer days, it's a pleasure to lie on the couch with a good, mindless, action movie, and let your brain just rot away into oblivion. On  this  fateful summer day, however, I made the mistake of choosing "The Beverly Hills Cop Trilogy" on DVD. As I listened to the disc spin up, I nearly chortled with glee with the thought of the gratuitous violence I was about to recieve. Several minutes into the film, I was lured into a hypnotic trance by its groovy synthpop soundtrack. Little did I know, "Beverly Hills Cop" is nothing more than an insidious piece of government propaganda, designed to force-feed programming into our atrophying brains!      Yeah, you smile now. You won't smile so much after I've punched you in the face, you big jerk.        Eddie Murphy: Does He Sneak Into Our Houses At Night And Steal Our Children?     Where was I?     I'll wipe that grin off your face with the back of my hand, asshole.   Ah, yes.   If you haven't already been lured into the story by the catchy 80's music, witty, fast-paced dialogue and expensive explosions, take a step back. Realize that your mind is being taken by force by the nefarious forces of evil known by some as Eddie Murphy and Jerry Bruckenheimer. Distracting your rational thinking, the movie implants several themes that contradict the very fundamental nature of reality.    Number One:  Getting around due process, undue search and seizure, and committing other variously grossly unconstitutional acts is easy AND fun if you're a plucky detective such as Axel Foley.    Number Two:  Jokes about how people in Beverly Hills are rich and people in Detroit are poor do not get old over the course of three movies and approximately six hours of viewing time.   Number Three:  Eddie Murphy's laugh doesn't remind you of a moose being beaten with a sick cat.   Number Four:  The Guy From "Mad About You" isn't a loser with a dead-end acting career. His role in the movie is deep and meaningful.     don't you start with me, Reiser, or i'll shut you up like i did your friend up there.   So, that about wraps it up. What is the purpose of these evil messages, waiting to insert themselves into your very soul? Who knows.

      On the occasions that I attempt to probe the deep and seemingly ineffable mysteries of existence, I eventually and inevitably run into difficulties. I still hold on to the little glimmer of hope that the Great Truth will find me, allowing me to transcend everyday, menial existence. Regarding my dalliances into the philosohpical, it usually begins as a general observation, then inquiry into the nature of said observation, such as   Why am I so happy? Why does me being happy have such a large impact on my behavior? Why should chemical signals left over from our animal beginnings have such a large impact on a supposedly "intelligent" species? Of what purpose is intelligence, then, if it means still being governed by emotions? Of what purpose is intelligence?  At that point, the questions stop being defined by language. I can feel the wave of meta-thought wash into the core of my mind, then disappear. From what I've been able to gather, though, is that all of our human systems (such as art, or mathematics, or morality or philosophy) all are intertwined, all providing reasons for the other's existence. Only, there's no foundation. It is a gigantic structure, human existence, built up on itself like some Escheresque suspension bridge, with no foundation.  And it scares me.  Why does me being scared have such a large impact on my behavior? Why should chemical signals left over from our animal beginnings have such a large impact on a supposedly "intelligent" species?... ...       info.link:  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/mikewinkler

Anyway, here's the inner monologue:  A  cot(x)sin(x)/sec(x) A  (cos(x)/sin(x))sin(x)/(1/cos(x)) A  cos(x)sin(x)/sin(x)/(1/cos(x)) A  cos(x)/(1/cos(x)) A  cos^2(x)/1 A  Ah, cos^2(x). A  I dig through my mind. BIFURICATE B  That's not a good metaphor. A  I don't think there is a good metaphor. B  Well, if there's not a good metaphor, it's not worth expressing. A  That's stupid. What was I saying? B  You like to dig through our mind, that's what's stupid. BIFURICATE C  Maybe he likes to channel-surf through our mind. A  Shut up. B  Shut up. C  Sorry. A  Okay, I thought of one. B  I hope it's not as stupid as the last one. C  What, the digging? B  Yeah. C  Oh. A  My mind is like a tree. B  That's trite. C  I like it. B  How can you possibly like it? C  He's talking about all the bifurication. C  I'd say it's more like a tree getting struck by lightning. B  Or a tree going through a wood chipper from the top down. B  Maybe a metaphor isn't the best way of going about this. A  Why do you say that? B  Because you're wasting our time thinking about wood chippers. A  Hey, that's you thinking about it, not me. B  It's my time, too. A  Oh, right. C  Why is your mind like a tree? A  Because, I can't follow a train of thought to its end point. C  Oh, the branching?

The Tour de Freedom, perhaps?   CHENEY: (Talking out of the side of his mouth) The Tour de France?  Well, the racers should come to my home state of Wyoming and try riding on them mountains, those are REAL mountains...not those pussy mountains out in France and Belgium.   ROVE:  I also have some good news, and I have some bad news.  The good news is, Lance Armstrong's second testicle does not pose a threat to the nation's security.  We have neutralized it and hidden it within our borders at a secure location.  The bad news is Dick Cheney refuses to share a shadow office with some "prissy bike-queen's testy."   -  urlLink Operation Infinite Justice

         A central lesson of science is that to understand complex issues (or even simple ones), we must try to free our minds of dogma and to guarantee the freedom to publish, to contradict, and to experiment. Arguments from authority are unacceptable.     urlLink -Carl Sagan          ...But Robert Paine, an ecologist at University of Washington who chaired an advisory panel on endangered salmon and trout, said his team was warned by the government to remove facts that undermined policy.  "We were told to strip out specific scientific recommendations or see our report end up in a drawer," Paine said.     urlLink -CNN         urlLink House.gov - Investigating the State of Science Under the Bush Administration   urlLink CNN.com - Bush Science policy swayed by politics   urlLink Scientific American - Bush-League Lysenkoism   urlLink Union of Concerned Scientists   They're not liberal lackeys or tree-hugging hippies. They're reputable scientists, and their business is the truth. The Bush Administration seems to regard science as a blunt tool, for pushing its religious and corporate agenda. Issue after issue of Bush policy clearly demonstrates the Administration's lack of regard for the scientific process and the truth.    urlLink Healthcare Disparities ,  urlLink Yellowstone National Park ,  urlLink Arctic Drilling ,  urlLink Oil and Gas Practices ,  urlLink Global Warming ,  urlLink Abstinence-Only Education ,  urlLink Breast Cancer Risks ,  urlLink Condom Effectiveness ,  urlLink HIV/AIDS Policy and Research ,  urlLink Prescription Drug Advertising ,  urlLink Stem Cell Research ,  urlLink Missile Defense ,  urlLink Education Policy ,  to name a few. ( urlLink house.gov ) I don't understand how anyone can deny that the truth has just been tossed aside in all of these cases, in favor of persuing "What God (Jerry Falwell) Sez" or larger corporate profits. Do people believe that the scientific community is lying, perhaps? Or that they've all been infected with homosexual liberal hysteria? The fact that the Bush administration can maintain 50% approval rating in the face of such evidence (with more mounting, not even to mention certain OTHER instances of *ahem* "truth massaging") is frightening, to say the least.   There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to the American public. It is a dimension as vast as space, but as hollow as a coconut. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between  urlLink science  and  urlLink superstition , and it lies between the pit of fundamentalist christianity, and the summit of corporate campaign contributions.

       urlLink Ridge Warns of Election Terror Plot   In the wake of major attacks, like those brought against the US on September 11, hard-line leaders are always more favored by the people. Thus, political experts have agreed that a terrorist attack before the Presidential election would almost guarantee a victory for Bush.   "But Jim," you say. "Bush is tougher on terror than Kerry! Wouldn't the terrorists want to manipulate the people to vote for Kerry, so they have an easier time?"  If by "tougher on terror" you mean "vengance-obsessed and wildly striking out at any (or all) of the many camel-oriented countries," then I think I would agree that Bush is tougher on terror.  What one must realize is that the terrorists  know  that Bush would win if they conducted an election attack. Therefore, they must be acting in self-interest. Why would terrorists want Bush in the White House again? Simple. By being "tough" on terror, Bush is GOOD for terror. The military action he is so very fond of creates conditions that are breeding grounds for terrorists: bombed-out cities, dead family members, prison torture. By making the United States hated and feared worldwide, the President Bush has galvanized anti-Western terrorist movements, and made himself a clear enemy that the terrorists feel represents America.      info.link:  urlLink http://www.cat-scan.com/  how i died today:  urlLink struck by lightning 5 times   [Listening to: I'm Not Driving Anymore -  urlLink Rob Dougan  (04:33)]

      I really need to find a focus here. I need to find something to write about.  All the really good blogs, they're all  about  something. All I've been able to determine is what this blog  isn't  about. It's not about my life... I really don't see that my life has any discerning qualities to seperate it from other lives.   That, of course, doesn't stop the millions of other people who go into great detail about their incredibly boring, normal lives - but I'm stopped by my obsessive need to be "original." I just wish I could write authoritarively on something - anything, besides these meaningless, inane rants on the nature of this-and-that.  Jimtopia isn't really about anything. That would imply that it's about "nothing," but I can't use that either. (Damn you to the blazes of hell, Jerry Seinfeld).  It's not even about me. I don't feel that this site accurately represents me, as a person, by any measure of accuracy.  On that note, I leave you.      info.link:  urlLink http://zapatopi.net/mindguard.html  how i died today:  urlLink mistaken for a homosexual by rabid lunatic   [Listening to: House of the Rising Sun -  urlLink The Animals  (04:31)]

      America. I love you, and all, but... your national anthem  really  sucks. I mean, it's acquired some reflected prestige from your world superpower status, but "O, Say Can You See..." is exactly the kind of namby-pamby 'Lite' song that should never be a national anthem. The lyrics are stupid, and the melody does nothing to inspire the spirit. To contrast: the  urlLink Soviet National Anthem . Of course, we all know it was bad, dictatorship, totalitarian, blah blah blah... but they really knew how to write a bad-ass national anthem. It's the kind of swelling, orchestral piece that can convert a foaming, reactionary fascist into a Party-line Pinko. I'm not saying the US anthem should be Communist, but the style is one we should adopt.  We need a better national anthem, America.

      Eugenics, as a concept, was introduced into the world consciousness with the horrific acts of genocidal dictator Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. The idea of eugenics is fairly simple: by eliminating problematic traits and genetic diseases from a gene pool, the health and standard of living will be improved for society as a whole. I agree with this, but only at the most basic, conceptual level (note: If I may, I would like to strip the word "eugenics" of all connotations for the remainder of this writing).    Note: I agree with eugenics because  homo sapiens  can no longer evolve as a species. The egalitarianism of the modern world has attempted to ensure that all, regardless of genetic makeup, have equal opportunities and an equal chance to survive. (For example, negative genetic mutations, such as those that cause poor eyesight, are no longer selected against, as eyeglasses make those with poor eyesight able to survive just as well as those with perfect eyesight.) I would like to stress that  This Is A Good Thing.  The reason I believe in egalitarianism is the same reason I disagree with most iterations of eugenics.    The many, many problems with eugenics arise from the execution. The Nazis took a brute-force approach, simply murdering those they deemed "undesirable." The genocidal campaigns of the Nazis barely fit under the definition of eugenics, as eugenics was used primarily as an excuse for psychopathic hatred and prejudice. Another, slightly less radical approach, is the sterilization of those with "bad genes." I obviously disagree with sterilization in that it's a clear-cut violation of reproductive rights (I hope I don't need to explain why I disagree with murder).   Despite all of this, a solution is on the horizon. Direct gene manipulation technologies will allow parents-to-be to eliminate genetic diseases and negative traits in their children. This is the only way I could possibly agree with eugenics (and really, then, due to all the negative associations the word has taken on, I'm not really a proponent of eugenics at all). Like most solutions, however, this one explodes into another firestorm of ethical questions. How do we prevent this technology from transforming the world into a Huxley-esque dystopia (also see: Gattaca)? Won't it further divide the rich and poor by making the rich more powerful  and  genetically superior to the poor? Insert fatuous worry about "playing God" here?  I raise many questions and provide few answers.

      Last night, I happened upon the phenomenon of "Free Ipods." Now, I've been suckered by internet scams before, so I promised myself I'd be more skeptical in dealing with this, but finding a reputable  urlLink Engadget article  assuaged my worries slightly. So, I dived in to  urlLink www.freeiPods.com  and decided to give it a whirl. Registration was fairly easy and standard - email address, password, home address, etc. After registration I was greeted by about 10-20 "Please Complete Our Short Optional Survey" prompts. I clicked "No" on all of them, it doesn't have any impact on registration. After that, I was asked to supply the names and email addresses of 5 friends. I skipped this step, and proceeded to the "Complete Offer" page.    Here's how it works:  There are 9 "Offers" available. They all involve some kind of payment, except the AOL 9.0 with Musicnet free trial and the RealRhapsody free trial. You'll still need a credit/debit card to give them, but no money changes hands as long as you cancel your account before the free trial is up. I tried signing up for both AOL and RealRhapsody, and found the RealRhapsody offer to be much easier. You sign up, download their software, then cancel the account online and uninstall it. AOL makes canceling much more difficult, I had to call Customer Support and deal with a perky, brainwashed sales rep with an annoying southern accent trying to talk me out of canceling.   This begins  The Hard Part : getting five other people to sign up and complete an Offer.  You're on your own from there. Have fun.    urlLink FREEIPODS.COM      Don't take my word for it, though - do your own research:   urlLink The Original Free iPod Guide   urlLink Freeipods.com Economic Analysis   urlLink Better Business Bureau - Freeipods.com/Gratis Internet    Side note: I'm interested in the legal status of this enterprise - it's obviously a pyramid-type scheme, but if it's working and people are actually getting their iPods, what's the problem?      info.link:  urlLink http://www.freeiPods.com/   [Listening to: American Woman -  urlLink The Guess Who  (03:48)]

      When you are greeting someone, in passing, and they ask you "How are you?" do you respond with "I'm fine," or "I'm fine, how are you?"   I usually respond with "I'm fine," or "Good," in a cheerful tone of voice.
