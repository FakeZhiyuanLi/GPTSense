      Monday mornings are crap. i hate getting up really early to catch the bus anyway but especially on modays. :( Today was interesting. For once KT didn't have a good weekend which kinda suprised me. even mine was more exciting. Kim and KT were both at skool today but there was no confrontation. Danm it. Oh well. Attempted to find out about kims saturday night. maybe tomorrowe. I finished leahs pom pom which is a lot bigger than planned but still awesome. I should probably be doing Homework right now so i better go. Dee

      I had yet another extremely boring weekend. Had to stay at brionys while the parentals rode to Cowra. I was invited to a party and then was uninvited just before arrival. What a waste of time and money. although i had KFC for dinner which numbed the pain slightly. i woke up incredibly early on sunday morning andbriony didn't get up till 11.30 in the morning. i have never been so bored in my life. Briony and i went shopping and i couldn't find anything to buy which sucked. so i was quite unimpressed. as you can tell i'm not really impressed with my weekend.

      Well I finished school on Friday, which was a fantastic day of fun and play. So for all you bludgers who didn't come. You missed the best day ever. After school I got my hair cut so it looks nice again. Now I need to learn to blow dry it straight(if anyone wants to teach me how I would be appreciative). On Saturday I worked all day which is 7.30 till 5.30 in North Sydney. Hello 6 am starts. That night the parentals went to the A.F.L so I was left to baby-sit the little bro, which was ok he wasn't too bad. We ordered pizza and watched movies. The highlight of the evening was a call from leah. She called from Airlie beach and it was great to speak to her. On Sunday I went shopping and to the movies with my Mum. It Was a fantastic day. We saw The Prince & Me which is a really good movie and I recommend it to everyone(even boys). I Bought Two new pairs of Jeans and two tops which was good. The Rest of my holidays have been sitting on my arse all day bored out of my brains and having to watch daytime TV. ARRGH!!  Somebody Save Me From Going Insane!! Luv Dee

      Hey people, First i would like to officially laugh out loud at Leah aand Liz who decided not to attend the Dance. Seconly to Deeni would like to say half a thank you for coming with me. I would give her a whole thanks but i only saw her half the night. Details later. Anyways for this dance we decided to be the stereotype tarts in the mini skirts and knee high boots. This evening i wore Sarzo's tie up boots (thanx Sarzo), a black mini skirt and a halterneck top with spots. Interesting i know. Anyways we picked up deenie at 7.20 and proceeded to the Kings School Gymnasium. Upon entering we dumped our bags and jackets and in my case jeans. We then went inside and secured the prime position in front of the dj's and speakers. In all, there was about 12 yr 11 bennies chicks.We then danced for a while to really crap music. I then went and got a drink and grabbed my jacket cause i was cold and my top was falling down. I danced a little more then deenie started dancing with some guy who was "16" and in yr 10. I went and got another drink. At this stage i decided to put my jeans on and i made my skirt into a top and i added my jacket. Now for those who don't know my jeans are lblack denium and my jackets blue denium and also for those who aren't style concious they don't mix together. Anyways i kept dancing and keeping a careful eye on deenie and her "lover boy"(sorry deens). Then because my skirt which became a boobtube kept falling down i made it into a belt. (very versatile piece of clothing) and i did my jacket up to make a top. By this trime there was half an hour left and deensta had been dancing with lover boy for over an hour. it was quite amusing as she did nothing much in like 2 hours and yet in five minutes people were all over each other with one interesting case. A one marian gilfedder getting with some year 9. Not on my list of things i ever wanted to see. Anyways about 10 minutes before the end of the dance deenie joined us again. So to deenie i hope you had fun nigelating me and thanks leah and liz for not making an appearance. More stuff happened but my wrist is getting sore so i can't be bothered to type more.  Luv D P.s. You should be nice to poor Charlie he thought you really had something!!

        I Am SOOO angry at the moment!!!   The first thing I'd like to do is apoligise to everyone that i may have or will take my anger out on!  Now The Reasons I'm Angry: 1-My mum made me a doctors appointment for my wrist (long story) but she didn't make it for today. Oh No!, that would have been a good idea instead she made it on monday after all my assessments are due in which i need to write copius amounts of information so now i will be able to write nothing therefore fail my assessments! :(  2- The Way a certain boy has been treating me and my friends. If you know me you know who this is, if you don't well you don't want to know. It all started one fateful day when i met friends to see a movie. it was all going fine until mr x started being an absolute bastard to me and my other counterpart. i didn't actually realise at the time he was being mean but i think about it now and realise. We then went up to see Leah in her break and mr x started being quite obviously very mean. i realised but thought he was in a pissy mood (which he was)but i thought about it and realised he'd never been very nice to Leah and Leah had never done anything to him. Whats a girl to do?? 3- I'm angry at my teachers because they set impossible exams that are  made for me to fail. it's only me that fails everyone else passes. it is annoiying the hell out of me. Why do they do that to ,me. i'm a good student. i ocassionally do work and what do i get for it... fail. 4- I'm angry at my school because they gave us really crap drama teachers who can't teach and who waste our time and energy. we need miss Fonteyne to teach us then we may have a chance at passing the HSC in drama. It's sooo screwed.  I'm angry at other people and things but i won't waste any more of your precious time.  Luv D P.S thanks Leah you are my rock!!

      MARK YOUR CALENDAR FOR NEXT SATURDAY  As you may, or may not, already know it is a sin for a Taliban male to see any woman other than his wife naked, and if he does, he must commit suicide.  So next Saturday at 4pm (Eastern time) all Australian women are asked to walk out of their houses completely naked to help weed out any neighborhood terrorists.  Circling your block for one hour is recommended for this anti-terrorism effort.  All men are to position themselves in lawn chairs in front of their houses to prove they are not Taliban, and to demonstrate that they think it is okay to see nude women other than their wives.  AND to show support for all Australian women, and since the Taliban also does not approve of alcohol, a cold 6-pack at your side is further proof of your anti-taliban sentiment.  The Government appreciates your efforts to root out terrorists and applauds your participation in this anti-terrorist activity.  Thank You Fpor Your Assistance In This Matter!!
