      So im here watching TBS and Everyone Loves Raymond comes on.  Thats right, im watching Everyone Loves Raymond, or what i shall forever call ELR.  As i watch this and listen to what i can only assume is a laugh track i cannot help but wonder why they brought the show back for another season.. expecially paying him a ton an episode!  he's got the typical cookie cutter tv family  the wife: the loving and understanding, he gets in an argument every episode or at lease some problem is reconciled  the brother: a little wacky and ackward he is the constant source of random amusement when he either hits his head on something, makes a wacky face when he is caught doing something or ray does something bad and the audience goes Ooooooooooo  the mother and father: crazy to a tee, these two are known to either shell out useless advice or make ray feel bad. much like the parents from seinfeld they bring up embarressing things about ray that he does not want anyone else to know about.   ah here comes seinfeld..its not much better but at least it makes me occasionally smile.
