      Here we are! My third post. Yep. And I still don't have much to talk about. I can't really talk about the weekend 'cause I didn't really do much. Well, yesterday we cooked the leftover hot dogs & burgers from a previous BBQ at a friend's house. That's something! Eh...see you next post.

      Sitting here in my pajamas with nothing to watch on TV (sigh).  So bored. I should get out, but the powers of the pajama holds me in it's most comfortable grip. Anyways, yesterday I decided to try out this blog-thing for a while, with the idea that I might eventually have something meaningful to say here (but I doubt that). Let's see how it goes!

      I sit in front of the mocking glow of the computer screen with my legs crossed, right over the left. My brow furrows, my fingers sleep on black keys, and nothing but a thought echoes between plastic headphones:  What the f*** am I going to write on my blog!?   Inner thigh itches. Lingering minutes that refuses to pass buzzes about annoyingly. I scan my faux-wood desk looking for beautiful inspiration, but find none. An empty glass, miniature men & women, and papers strewn about is all was spotted. My knee itches. I am reminded of the thousand-and-one mosquitoes my friends and I encountered at the park earlier that day. How I hate the tiny pricks.  A yawn washes over my body at 1:04 am. I stretch as many muscles to the tune of the blissful yawn, because I know the moment to follow would be a completely relaxing feeling. A thought comes to me, hasten by the fact I should get some sleep. It whispers: take the last seven seconds and stretch it into three paragraphs of filler. Keys dance without hesitation. A barely audible titter escapes my mouth, finding humour in the fact that someone will see through my sad attempt at being a writer. With sleep beckoning to me, I'm sure there will be spelling and grammatical errors, but I don't care. I have finished a post, ending several days of creative drought on my blog.

      You need to check out  urlLink Diesel's latest campaign for their Fall/Winter 2004 Collection . Their whacked-out design team some how were able to take their keen fashion sensibilities and twisted it to work within the context of an old sci-fi/fantasy comic magazine you'd find in the 70's. Incredible!   SONG OF THE DAY  Unicorns - Emasculate the Masculine

      A while back I was messaging with my friend Jen, and I made up a poem on the spot just because. A ridiculous ditty that may bring joy if even for a moment. So today I wish to share it, give you a moment or two of cheer, or at least a seed of inspiration to write something silly.      Upside down umbrelly to catch all your precious rain     then sip the goodness of rain that fell from the heavens     the rest of the heaven juice will be boiled to make tea for two     with a dollop of honey for sweetness     SONG OF THE DAY  Yesterday's New Quintet - I Am Singing

      One of the good things about these kind of Sundays is you're left with nothing but your meandering thoughts to entertain yourself. It's interesting what runs through your head, you go through two different states of thought (or at least that's how my mind is working at this moment): Analytical and Creative.  With analytical thoughts you start analyzing things (outwards and inwards) in your life. Creating a mental list of things that can be better organized or improved upon. And within that list a sub-list of steps to take to create change is created. Now to initiate these changes, motivation is needed. The tasks you've listed may seem daunting, but can be done with the proper inspiration to push you. That's where the creative thoughts come to play.  Your creative thoughts can inspire you to action or it can distract you. The mind poses different questions or situations where you come up with solutions or possibilities. Depending on the solutions or possibilities generated, motivation can be built. And I just lost my train of thought and forgot where I'm heading with this. :P  Oh, well. Happy Father's Day, everyone!   SONG OF THE DAY  Peter Tosh - Stepping Razor

       Today's top story:  Man discovers life does not stink. It has been revealed that the stench that was thought to be emanating from life was in fact coming from the world. When asked about this recent discovery, man replies "The world has indeed stunk for many years, tests that were performed earlier show that man just gotten used to the smell."  In other news, man continues to bitch and complain like a baby on his blog. More on that after weather and sports.   SONG OF THE DAY  Queens of the Stone Age - Never Say Never

       urlLink Murphy's Law: If anything can go wrong, it will.   All too often this stupid law proves itself irrefutable with the universe's innate ability for ineptitude. Through the years, new laws are formulated and added; it's gotten so numerous, laws can be split into different categories like bus laws and nurse laws. And as much as I loathe to add a new law, it should be included in it's Love Laws: If you are interested in someone, they can  AND will have a boyfriend and/or think of you as just a friend.  I find this cynical way of thinking very stinky, but it feels like all I can do is give in. I'm tired of the 'love game', why should I play when I can't even get a chance to bat. How often can one dust himself off and stand back up without having to hunch? Where do you go from there? You go to the gym, then to Perkins for some Eggs Benedict, then complain about it on your blog, that's what.  See you in the funny papers.   SONG OF THE DAY  Spoon - I Summon You

      Yep. Sunday. And I've never felt so unproductive in my life. I did absolutely jack squat all day, I just sat in front of this ol'computer and watched a less-than-stellar anime series,  urlLink Ikkitousen  (i dunno, maybe you'll enjoy it more than me). The only time I got up was to eat or go to the bathroom. I know there's a lot of things I could do, I'm just not motivated lately. And I really HATE that feeling. Gwah! I should just go to sleep. Good night, people.   SONG OF THE DAY  Lawrence Welk - Good Night

      Know the real Harold...according to  urlLink Master Rao . I don't believe astrology, but I've always found them damn fun! This reading was taken from combining your western and chinese sign.   "You function almost exclusively with your heart, your reason having no word to say here. With your extreme emotivity, you sift everything through the sieve of your affectivity. Even your intelligence is always colored with sentimentality.    Loving beauty under all its forms, you're inclined to facility and like to profit by the unexpected. You obtain much from others by your charm and kindliness, and can get things accepted without having to fight. In fact, you're more made for enjoyment than for struggle. Your greatest flaw is touchiness.    You've gifts for studies and much chance in examinations. Your taste for letters, publishing, bookselling, for all that's related to distribution of art and beauty can bring you great profits. You also have a good contact with the public and frequently enjoy certain notoriousness. Your friendship or love relations play a great role in your material destiny by facilitating your fortune.    In love, you're gifted for pleasing even though you hesitate to attach yourself profoundly. What you'd prefer would be to live a merry single life. But you'll also be happy in a union where fantasy and an easy way of life prevail."    SONG OF THE DAY  White Stripes - One More Cup of Coffee

      Blogs. Everyone should have one. It's like one's personal soapbox where one one can rant and rave about how it sucks when you're at the gym and you sit down at a bike realizing too late the previous biker neglected to wipe it down leaving his nasty sweat and B.O., or showcase the latest pic of your drunk lady friends flashing their lop-sided boobies to any horny by-standers willing to look (which I don't have, sorry). It's kind of empowering that way.  Recently my friends,  urlLink Rob  and  urlLink Ray , started up their own blogs and I'm trying to get more people into it. I found it cool reading what insights they have when you're not hanging with them at the moment. Insights like:  Don't you hate it when you have to fart, but someone comes up to you and starts a long conversation, and you try to hold the fart in, but can't, so you try to let it out in a way it doesn't make a noise and pray that it doesn't stink? Yeah, I know I hate that.    SONG OF THE DAY  Kylie Minogue - Chocolate

       urlLink Le Parkour  is a relatively new sport created by David Belle. You've probably seen  urlLink commercials  with Le Parkour in it. Imagine Jackie Chan taking up skateboarding, only he forgot the skateboard.  I find the stuff they do really cool. I'm surprised I don't see more of it around. Heck I'd take it up if it weren't for the fact I'm, y'know, lazy.   SONG OF THE DAY  Human Beinz - Nobody But Me

      Once again NBA's  urlLink Hoop-It-Up  is coming to Winnipeg this weekend, and as suggested by Rob, I thought it'd be fun to profile the team slated to dominate all suckers on the court and take 1st place in their division. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you (dum, dum, dum....)  Max High All-Stars!!!    Rob Carino  AKA Max High  Team Captain  This man's proven that a man can bleed basketball. Through injury after injury, this outside treat is still ready to go high....MAX HIGH!   Rhoden Chavez  AKA 2 Hype Hesitate for a moment and Rhod will school you 5 times and call you Susan! Size will not intimidate him, so you better bring your game on.   Ray Hamel  AKA the Weatherman Eye of the Tiger may be a cliche phrase, but still rings true when describing the man called Ray. Through will and determination, he'll take it to you any way he can.   Chris Kolev  AKA 2 Dope You'd think his height would be his major advantage, but it's not. Chris brings mad skillz (yes, with a 'z') to the table and will smash the table with said skillz.   Rey Quiogue  AKA Your Daddy Don't let his smile fool you, inside is a monster waiting to be unleashed. Get into his space and he'll shut you down before you even think of going up.

      The sun was shining with hot temps and a slight cool breeze, felt like I accomplished quite a bit at work, I got a haircut, took time to sit at one of those neighbourhood parks, had gelati with a friend who I haven't seen in a while, and I just finished up the day with a refreshing shower after a nice little workout. Today did feel good, almost perfect. The only thing that can make it better is if a gorgeous woman fell into my lap carrying a million dollar cheque with my name on it. Well, there's an hour and change left in the day, so here's hoping!  A couple of friends been saying my blog needs some pictures of naked chicks. Well, if there's enough requests for it I'll do it, but in the meantime they'll just have to settle for  urlLink this .   SONG OF THE DAY  Broken Social Scene - Pacific Theme

       Note: I'm probably missing a lot of details in this description of our Vegas trip, maybe because it was undescribable!   Probably goes without saying that Rob and I were estactic to be heading to Las Vegas, Nevada for vacation. It was our first time in the city of bright lights, Elvis, and showgirls, and it showed. As we were about touchdown, our excitement mounted higher and higher at the sight of desert and mountains (or as we grew to call them 'mow-taings'). The desert heat hit us immediately as we left the ear-popping plane. An amazing 40°C (and it maintained that temperature for the rest of the vacation)!  At the  urlLink Tropicana Hotel  they didn't have the room we requested available, so they upgraded us to an Island Tower room. Bonus! We quickly threw our baggage into the room, so we can explore the Strip, but not before taking notice the king-size bed had mirrors surrounding it at the top, right, and above. Funny. Now, we walk. This being our first time here, our senses are loaded with bright flashing colours selling tonights show and sounds of the 80s blaring from hidden speakers, creating feelings you get when you first enter a candy store as a kid. We walk forever in the heat seeking refuge at cooling stations and air-conditioned casinos serving free beer, we thought we can go on without sleep, so we wouldn't miss one beat of this city. Fat chance! We wuz tired!  The next day we continue walking despite blisters from the other day. Walking past vendors handing out strippers-to-your-door fliers we found  urlLink Madame Tussauds Wax Museum . There, we posed with many celebrity wax-replicas. Touching and prodding them as much as the curators would allow. Very fun. At night we head over to  urlLink Cheetahs , the topless club where they filmed the movie  urlLink Showgirls . Surrounded by beautiful women, I kinda got carried away with the booze, making the next day a write-off. Sleep and vomitting took up the whole day, leaving me enough energy to eat at  urlLink Todai  for a Japanese buffet dinner.  Tuesday was spa day. We booked that day to get ourselves pampered a bit. I got an aromatherapy wrap and a massage, and it felt good! At the end of it all my skin felt smooth, my body relaxed, and I smelt like coconut, almond, jasmine, and eucalyptus at the same time. And at night I decided to take in a show. I went to see  urlLink Zumanity  and it was awesome! Nothing beats watching half-naked contortionists, acrobats, and dancers performing unbelievable feats.  Highly recommended!  Then it was time to leave. I was sad to go. I had to take in the sights one last time, trying to burn in the imagery into my mind what my camera couldn't capture. We board the plane. Rob gave up his window seat, so I can see the Vegas terrain as we took off. Lotta mow-taings. At our stop-over in Minneapolis we were running late, so we had to run for it like you see people do in the movies. Finally we were home in Winnipeg. It was weird coming back, we had just left a city with bright lights and +40° weather to a flat town with a mild 15° temperature. It felt so laid back compared to the energy of Las Vegas. I kinda missed it. But can't wait to leave it again! ;)  Photos of our trip can be found  urlLink here .   SONG OF THE DAY  Jody Watley - I'm Looking For A New Love

      In about 34 hours me and my pal, Rob, will be boarding a plane to fabulous Minneapolis! What's in Minneapolis? Another plane to wisk us off to  urlLink Las Vegas, Nevada ! What's in Las Vegas? Nothing but 4 nights of family-oriented sin!  I've lost sleep thinking about Vegas. It'll be the first time to fly in a plane. It'll be that farthest I've even been from home (Edmonton being the furthest so far). It'll be just two guys in a town geared for having a good time and we have no gameplan whatsoever! I was just thinking of standing in the middle of the street and letting the natural flow of the city's energy take me whereever it wants. If anyone happens to see us, feel free to join us in the grand adventure they call Sin City. Drinks on whoever feels like paying.  On a different topic, if you're philipino born in North America, please rent  urlLink The Debut . It's like watching your family onscreen...only with a dance-off. Please check it out.  "An award-winning English language film for the whole family, "the Debut" revolves around Ben Mercado (Danté Basco), a talented high school senior who has rejected his Filipino heritage. The long-simmering feud between Ben and his immigrant father Roland (Tirso Cruz III) threatens to boil over and ruin the 18th birthday party of Ben's sister Rose (Bernadette Balagtas). But to Ben's surprise, his sister's celebration challenges his sense of misplaced identity, and the way he regards his father and grandfather (Filipino film legend Eddie Garcia). In one night, Ben faces the true nature of his relationships with his family, his friends, and himself."

         This past Monday and Tuesday, me and my amigos were at the  urlLink WWE  Raw and Smackdown shows, respectively. Even though we had less than spectacular seats, it was a fun time filled with blood, sweat, and smoke! Good times, good times.  Though I'm fully aware of it's homo-erotic undertones and it's ridiculous storylines, there's something about wrestling I find appealing. I think it's because it's the closest thing we have to real-life super heroes. Think about it: characters in colourful costumes, larger than life physiques, good guys vs. bad guys, people performing incredible feats and taking inhuman amount of pain. The only difference is the whole "flying and shooting lasers out of your eyeballs" thing, and I think they're going to have the Undertaker do that next week.

      G'day, eh? I hope everyone's enjoying their day off to celebrate  urlLink Canada Day . Whether it be camping, catching the fireworks display, or just getting piss-drunk. Me? I did what any good Canadian would do and saw  urlLink Spider-Man 2 .  I have to say that I enjoyed it. Even though the movie had the same amount of cheesiness the first one had (must be a  urlLink Sam Raimi -thing) and many parallels can be made to the first movie (villain created in lab accident, kidnaps MJ, yadda yadda yadda), I thought the overall presentation was superb. The effects were better, fight scenes were really cool, and you still feel for Parker (the poor sap).  Verdict: Well, it get a (some-what biased) thumbs up from this comic-nerd! And if you're wondering what Spidey and Canada have in common? Not a damn thing, you hoser.   SONG OF THE DAY  Hidden Cameras - Boys Of Melody
