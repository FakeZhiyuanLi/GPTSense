      It's been quite a while since I've written in this, I'm not sure why though?  Oh well here I am on the computer again when I'm not supposed to, I hooked up the cord again.  Hmm, nothing much at all has happened lately.  Or has it?  Well I got these pretty bad ass sunglasses yesterday.  I've stil been going to the gym during lunch playing extreme ping-pong with Steven, I'm fucking awesome.  LoL, I've never played before these past two weeks, and damn, I'd like to think I'm pretty good.  We still go see those chicks and talk to them, Maren is pretty cute and very nice.  She just happens to live quite near me.  I knew her sister way back in Kinder, hehe.  Steven was all telling me to hook it up with her, but damn I don't even know her.  I don't think I'd mind though?  I was able to evade both bans in #totse and #zok today, I rock:)  I also talked to Ironz on the phone, I haven't talked to him in all of forever, he's doing fine.  I also talked to Nathalie two days ago, I haven't done that in quite a bit, she tells me she's volunteering at this church as a teacher, I was like aww...how cuuute, because it is.  Crazy.  She's trying out to be a cheerleader, I can't see her doing that.  Dave and I are going to jam out today or tommorow, I'm not sure when I can borrow Jimmy's drumset.  But that'll be awesome.  I took my midterms yesteday, I think I did well, I'm not quite sure?  I'll just have to wait and see on Monday now won't I?  Yup, there isn't much left to say, I'll write later on today though.  OMG, you have to see this, it's the funniest shit I've seen in months, it's supposed to be North Korea's dictator Kim Jong Ill's LiveJournal:  http://www.livejournal.com/users/kim_jong_il__/  Omg, it's light outside, wow, that's crazy, I can't believe I still haven't gone to sleep.  Well I think that's what I'm going to go do, Bye now.

      I can't sleep, but this time I have school tommorow, so I have to try I guess.  My parents got all pissed at me today because I forgot how to do the homework that was assigned to me on Thursday.  Really mad, I ended it pissing off my mom and she just told me to take a bath and go to sleep.  She said it was the computer's fault, that I'm obssessed by it.  That's not true, what else is there to do in my house?  NOTHING!  Damn, when I'm at my cousin's I have no urge to use the computer like I do here, because there are actually things to do there.  It's fucking crazy, and I hate it when she calls people online that I know, imaginary.  They aren't imaginary, they are as fucking real as you and me.  What would you rather do, watch TV, or talk to people online, learn about things, play games that interact with you, I mean fuck, it's the obvious answer.  But she doesn't see that, oh well.  It rained a lot today, and then after there was a cool breeze, that was awesome.  I love it when it's dark and rain outside, one of the best times of the year, besides when it's cold.  I got a little Yahoo pictures account setup, so I don't have to keep sending people my pictures with my slow ass connection.  Oh you want to see it?  Here you go.  http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/osiris6411/lst?&.dir=/Boredom&.src=ph&.begin=9999&.view=t&.order=&.done=http%3a//photos.yahoo.com/bc/osiris6411/lst%3f%26.dir=/Boredom%26.src=ph%26.view=t   Quite long URL, I know.  I'll post the pictures I took with my "nice" camera later.  Damn, my shoulders are soo sore from all the working out I've been doing, it kinda sucks, but I'll live, and lift weights tommorow as planned.  I just need to start a schedule for running.  Hmm...July 28, BAM, I'm going to be built as hell.....heh:)  I got a new door...WOO.  LoL.  Awesome boots I'm going to buy http://www.coveshoe.com/mt_hh_10tanker.html  Until next time,        adieu mon ami :)

      My dad took the power cord away from the computer tonight after he saw me get off the computer at 7.00 AM yesterday.  But, you have to remember, I'm quite the sneaky one.  I have the power cord from te computer my uncle gave me, I just hooked it up, and I'm running.  Not much happened today, I was online, lifted weights.  Kenny came over around 5.00 PM, surprised me.  He stayed over 'til about 7 or so.  He borrowed lke 6 of my CD's, heh, and I finally got my necklace back:)  I talked to Heather a bit today, damn she's really cool.  Myra told me to download this sound called Creep by Radiohead, it was such an awesome song, thanks Myra:)  I got Opped in #Jshroom by Eiri who I finally talked to for a good while, he's a cool guy, thought I was in my late 20's, he was kinda surprised to find out I was only 16.  I read about Satanism today for no reason whatsoever, but it was intresting, I'm going to read more about.  I'll post some thing about it later.  Damn, I saw the hottest picture of Shami tonight.   http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/angels_chula/vwp?.dir=/&.src=ph&.dnm=My+BellY!.jpg&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.yahoo.com/bc/angels_chula/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=ph%26.view=t  Damn, she has an awesome body, heh.  Yeup, oh well, it's only 4.30 AM, I think I'm going to go chat a bit more in IRC and own a bit more on Soldier of Fortune, before I go to sleep.

      I've been awake all night again, haven't slept a wink yet, I'm not that tired either.  There was a little storm around 5:00.  I'm calm now, not pissed anymore, like the last entry.  I am now moderator of two forums, Philosophy and Harmony (dealing with music) in Mr-Smith's BBS.  You should register  urlLink  .  Yeup.  I just got done owning in Soldier of Fortune once again, 50 kills in 10 minutes:)  I didn't do anything at all today that I can recall, I think I'm going to the movies with my cousins this afternoon, that is, if I can wake up.  Yup, I'm off to go lie down, I don't feel tired, but I'm sure once I lie down I will, so until someday later today  Adieu.

      How I felt about an hour ago.  I was talking to Mona arguing about how things are, yeah, that shit, and right. And out of nowhere she goes  "BabyGi7875 (9:46:23 PM): look im tired and im gonna go play my guitar I will more talk about this later  BabyGi7875 (9:46:31 PM): talk more* Amphitrius324 (9:46:34 PM): It's not liek I'm ever going to talk to you BabyGi7875 (9:46:47 PM): there you go again typical typical haha goodnight"  We won't ever fucking talk about it, she never fucking calls, ahh, she pisses me of soo much.  But then I played Soldier of Fortune and killed people over and over which let out my frustration. I was ready to fucking call her up right then and scream, I was soo pissed, you can't imagine.  I'm glad I didn't though, I'm going  to let her call me (ha, as if that'll ever happen.)  I think I'm going to stay up all morning again, there isn't anything else to do.  Heh, that chick Heather thinks Jon is hot, pretty funny.  She's quite cute herself.

      This makes soo much sense. Read more about this theory at  http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html  Many women want to argue this point and say things like " I have lots of guy friends." Maybe. There are exactly 3 cases Intellectual Whores has identified whereby a guy and a girl can be friends:  1. The guy is gay 2. The guy does not find you attractive. 3. The guy already has a woman much higher than you on the ladder  Even Nietzsche knew this. Most guys know this intuitively. Most girls doubt. I have a challenge for all of you girls who still doubt. Pick a guy who does not meet any of the criterion on the above list that you think is your friend. Then ask yourself this question: If you were both alone at his place one night, and you excused yourself to the bathroom and came out naked and asked him to have sex with you would he:  1. Tell you he doesn't want to risk the beautiful friendship you have created with messy physical entanglements. 2. Comply  Remember this only works if you are honest with yourself. Number one is of course something that guys hear all the time

      I haven't gone to sleep yet, I've been awake since about 8.00 AM, this morning, I'm quite the insomniac.  I've been online all night, talking on AIM, IRC, owning on Soldier of Fortune.  Heh, I was checking out Deepak's webapage and this chick Heather thought John was hot, that was pretty funny.  She's pretty cute herself and we have a lot in common.  DAMN'T!  For the past 15 mins I've been trying to put a comments area on the page, but I can't FUCKING get it, I don't know why!?  Nevertheless, I'm pissed, I'm going to figure it out eventually.  I think I'm going to go to sleep soon, I'm not tired, I've run out of things to do online.

      Yes, I fixed the settings, I rock.  LoL, it's now 1:02 AM, and I'm bored as usual, I'll probably be awake 'til about 4.00 AM again.  I kicked some ass in Soldier of Fortune right now, had 78 kills with my 300 ping:)   My sister's recital was ok, there was a lot of hot chicks there, I mean, A LOT.  Wow, it was pretty cool.  But yeah, I'm talking to Danielle right now.  I have concluded that Mona, no matter what she says, does not care nearly as much as she use to about our relationship.  It's sad, but "Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky It slips away. "  Something was bound to happen.  Maybe we'll fix it, who knows:(?  Yup, I'm off for now, bye.....

      Today as usual was boring as hell.  I woke up late, my brother and sister didn't go to swimming today, so I didn't realize what time it was, I was a bit late to class, nothing important.  I took a test, I'm not sure what I got, I'm guessing around an 85 - 95?  I ate lunch with Jenny, Daniel, and Allison.  I wasplaying with Jenny's phone and pretended to call someone, and MS. Tenorio came and fucking grabbed it out of my hand, I got pissed.  She siad to pick it up after school, and I would have to pay $5.  It was fucking crazy, but it ended up, Jenny picked it up, and she didn' thave to pay, I'm going to talk to that bitch tomorrow, it reall ypissed me off for some reason.  I'm going to my sister's dance recital soon, I'll probably write again this morning.  The time is way off for some reason?  I have to fix it.  Adieu.

       Again you say?   Yes, again, I have a lot to say. Yup, so since the last post, I've gone to the beach, fishing with my dad, brother, and uncle Ernie, they fished, caught a few, I was bored, and didn't bring my reel, didn't much feel like fishing either.  I ended up calling Mona on the cell, I talked to her for quite a while, didn't talk much, she hasn't called in forever.  I haven't spoekn to her since about two weeks ago or so.  Oh well, it's a start.  She called when I got home, I call back 5 minutes later, no answer, weird.  Probably asleep.  Right now I'm talking to Danielle, how cuuuuuuute.  LoL.  Yup, I'm bored now, nothing to do, I'll probably see if I can call Danielle, if not, go to sleep after I work out (by July 28, I'm going to be fucking built, you'll see:)  Around 2 or so, I have to wake up at 7 :(   Summer school, 5 hours of Algebra 2 it really sucks.  Yup.  Oh well,  Bye now.

      I'm bored.  So far summer school has been long and boring.  Very boring.  I fall asleep quite a bit in 2nd period.  It's not fun.  Heh, I like little sentences.  Yeah, I'm tired right now, hence the grammar.  I need sleep, I went to sleep last night at 4:00 AM and woke up at 7:00 AM, and I haven't slept since.  I'm banned once again from #totse.  Damn that Zok.  I'll get on again when I want.

Just insult my computer after I sign up. :)  This is the first day of the rest of my life.  Or is the the last day of my life?  We won't know until the next post now won't we?  Adieu.

      Just wandering through IRC is what I'm done, you'd be amazed at this huge web of networks upon networks with the sole purpose of connecting people to a global *nix based chat service, very amazing, you just have to sit back and actually think about it.  Heh.  Today, I did nothing as usual, boring indeed.  I talked to Mona finally, she said she was hurt to hear the message, and she's dealing with something else and she can't handle it all, weird shit like that.  I talked to Crystal though, that got my mind off of that subject so that was good.  I got online downloaded a few Trance Opera songs and watched Pirates of the Carribbean.  Michael brought Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Carribbean, and The Hulk today for burning, GREAT quality.  Yup, I played SoF and owned as usual, laggy as hell too, and I'm looking for an active channel in IRC as we speak.  I'm not having any luck, I'll have to resort to the very restrcited Aussie channels or some Kiwi one, we'll see.  Bye now.

      Why hello there.  I'm back as you see, I have not been gone for long, a few days at most, but not to fear, I am back again with my boring life.  Or so I think it is, because by the time I get to thinking about it, all the excitement is gone.  So maybe it really isn't that boring, but oh well, now for the recap on yesterday and today.  Yesterday, I got The Matrix: Reloaded, Terminator 3, and Legally Blonde 2, in GREAT quality.  I'm talking VHS quality off the internet.  Very, very good, they were SVCD's that's why : )  I watched T3 and TMR until about 5 AM.  I then went to sleep and awoke to today.  Nothing much at all happened today.  I slept until about 3 again.  Woke up, got online, did much of nothing.  Later on in the evening I saw Mona online, that was a bit of a surprise.  I was going through one of my little psychotic fits, I was all hyped up, I was shaking, my fingers and toes were cold, and I had a cold sweat.  Pretty weird.  I asked Mona to call, but as usual she didn't.  I called her, and left a message saying all this shit, it's over and everything, it was because of my little psychotic fit that made me say this.  And midway throught the message I broke down crying saying I don't know why I said all those things.  I have to admit it was very weird.  Although, I don't think she'll hear that message for a good long while.  She never fucking checks them.  Oh well, then I got online.  Spoke on IRC and AIM.  I also Uploaded 3 new pictures on my photo album, showed Anahi and Josie.  Played SoF, owned as usual.  Then around 5 my dad caught me online.  He's taken the power cord for the past 2 weeks or so.  And well he didn't say much of anything, it was already 5, so why bother, you know?  And now here I am, writing and talking on IRC.  My God, my fingers hurt.  Bye now.

      Newbies upon newbies were in the rooms today in Soldier of Fortune, I owned their asses like there was no tommorow, 170 in under 20 minutes, no caps.  But as for today, nothing at all happened, as usual.  My dad went to the beach with my brother, sister, my uncle, and his kids.  I was asleep.  I found that Ironz's situation yesterday was nothing more him acting out a paper he was writing.  Little bastard, I read his paper in Spurious and it made my eyes well up, I got offline and called and then he told me that it was just a paper for his English class, very good paper indeed, evoked my emotions.  I then did nothing for a few hours.  I watched Men of Honor (good movie).  I called Crystal after, talked to her for a bit, but then she went to go watch some movie, and she was supposed to call back, but oh well: )  I was online downloading some songs and I left the computer for a bit, and I come back surprised, Javier had told me to go out with Anahi, bu the time I got back, he was gone.  But I was surprised, I wondered why he would tell ME this?  Oh well, I'll ask tommorow, but I have to admit, it was pretty weird.  As for that, nothing else happened this night online.  I'm just talking to my little buddy Killswitch here on #totse.  I think I'm going to go to sleep soon, it's 6:18 AM now, so until tommorow morning, adieu mon ami:)

      Yes, it's 5:10 AM here, and as usual I'm sitting here bored talking to my good friend GeneralSpecific on IRC and convinving some newbie that I'm an FBI agent after he admitted to making counterfeit bills on Photoshop and using them.  Nothing much at all happened today, even less than yesterday, heh.  I talked to Crystal from 9 to 11, and that's about it.  She's suuuper cute, heh.  It's crazy.  You crazy cat!  Yup, I got online, talked to Anahi, she's doing better, so that's good.  Pr0to and Ironz are getting kicked out of their houses:(  We'll see what happens, I hope they're ok.  I'm more worried about Ironz, he has nowhere to stay and he doesn't know what to do.  Pr0to has a job, someone to stay with and a car soon, so he's doing well.  Oh well, I'll see what Ironz's situation was tommorow on Spurious, he was too tired to explain.  Besides all that, all I did was OWN in Soldier of Fortune again:)  As usual.  And here I am typing away, but I shall go now, nothing much left to say,  Bye now.

      Yup, it's about 5:42 AM right now and I've been awake all night.  I just looked at my eyes and they're all red, damn.  Nothing much happened today as usual, I slept 'til about 3 PM.  The night before I went to Michael's house, he got broadband, so I couldn't resist.  I downloaded millions upon millions of songs, it was orgasmic (the speed that is.)  But now, I'm just here online, doing nothing but chatting on IRC, #totse, #jshroom.  I watched X-Men 2 today, it was ok, not really my kind of movie, but I liked it none the less.  I talked to Anahi tonight, she broke up with Javier, poor thing, I hope she feels better and does what she has to do to make it better, if she wants that is:(  And yup, nothing going on, just another boring day.  Nothing to say or do.  Oh well, I'm not going to sleep, but that's all I have to say for this morning, Bye now:)  Time  It's soo quiet I can hear my thoughts touching every second that I spent waiting for you circumstances have given me no second chance  to tell you how much I've missed you. My beloved do you know how many times I've stared at clouds thinking that I saw you there? These are feelings that do not pass so easily I can't forget those things we claimed as ours. Moments lost in time remains I am so proud of what we were No pain remains, no feeling My restless soul is longing Insanity awaits.

      Well I haven't written in this in quite a while as you can see.  Things have actually happened, amazing isn't it?  The last day of summer school is tommorow, FINALLY.  I really hope I pass, I haven't been doing my work, but I've been doing well on the tests, and passing barely.  I don't know why I do that?  It's pretty fucked up, I hate it.  I wish I could always do my best, but I just don't really care.  But when I sit back and think about it I do.  It's crazy.  And tommorow, I'm spending the night at Mike's, he's getting cable, 500+ Kb/s!, orgasmic isn't it?  I can't wait, I installed his internal CD burner yesterday without instructions, just using my common computer knowledge.  I felt special : )  Not as if it were that complicated at all, oh well.  It's kinda sad that tommorow is the last day, I think I'm going to miss some people, considering some are seniors and some go to other schools, I might not see them again, or for a looong time.  Oh well, I've gotten the SN's and phone numbers of those people I've wanted to keep in touch with.  Heh, today during lunch I was with Lucas checking out girls as usual, and we looked for Maren to get her number, so I could keep in touch with her.  We couldn't find her and we were about to leave, but then she came to the S pod, quite a coincidence.  Out of all the places in the whole school, she went there, so I got it and that was good, heh.  About two weeks back I went to Dave's house and jammed out, it sounded really good for not ever playing together, I think we're going to start a band, by the way, I play drumset, been playing for about 6 years.  He's been palying guitar for about the same length of time, we just need a good bassist.  Otherwise than everything I stated above, nothing at all has happened.  'tis crazy how boring it can get.  Well actually,  I did talk to Anahi 2 days ago, I hadn't spoken to her in like 4 weeks, and Mona FINALLY called back.  Damn her.  Heh, but we did talk, so that was good.  She said she'll call back soon, we'll see.  Yup, but that's it for now, I can't think of anything else, so until next time, Adieu:)

      'tis been quite a while now hasn't it?  Missed me?  Heh, I didn't think so.  Man, nothing has been going on lately, as usual, I've just started school last week.  Very tiring it is.  I thought U.S. Hisotry AP would be harder than it is now.  I mean our History class last year was much harder, but oh well.  I haven't talked to much anyone on the phone here at home.  It's kind of weird, I was just used to it I guess.  Band practice has been tiring as hell as usual.  Very hot, I turned black, heh.  Yeah, and I'm going to fix our drumline website, I recruited Josh to help: )  We'll see if he's really that good at graphics, heh.  I haven't talked to Mona since......Hmmm, I can't even remember the last time I talked to her.  I see her in the halls every now and then, I don't say hi, neither does she.  Sad, really, but I've seemed to finally cope with it.  Heh, this song reminds me of her, yes I know I sound like a loser, but it's kinda hard not talking or not seeing  someone you're that close to.  Just sometimes there are certain moments, when I think about it, and it really bothers me.  But I'll do fine, I think.  I have a football game to perform at today, heh, be at the band hall by 4 PM.  I've been awake since 4 AM, and now it's 7:17 AM.  Suprisingly enough I'm not that tired.  I'm going to go to sleep for a bit soon, I should get some rest before the game, if not, I'd stay on 'till my parents told me to get offline.  Yup, life is boring, and I've yet to meet anyone intresting.  As far as girls that is.  I was looking up colleges about two days, found quite a few with the my major, but they ended up being vocational schools:(  I want to go to a college, o university, take other classes as well, like psychology or philosophy.  Oh well, heh, yesterday was Fili's birthday, we tried putting him in the quint case, but he wouldn't go.  Sophie bought him this cake and gift basket, very cute it was.  Once I start getting the Drumline site up, I'll post the pictures.  But as for now I think I'm going to go sleep, there isn't anything else to do online.  Well there is, but as I said before I need sleep, even though I'm not that tired.  I know I will be later, maybe?   Adieu Mon ami.

      Yes, it's been quite a while.  I'm not going to say much at all right now, because I'm tired as hell from practice and I'm planning on lying down soon.  I'm just reassuring those who might have seen this, that, indeed I am still alive.  Not that you might care or anything, but it makes me feel better knowing that I'm not putting anyone in anxiety over my possible death.  More to come later, well just about everything that has happened in these past months.  Bye now:)

      What to say?  I have nothing to say.  But I shall grace you all with my "Rules of Life."  Enjoy:  12 Rules for living life  1. Never accept the rules and regulation society has placed on you. Explore. 2. Never believe the mass media. 3. Never assume you know what's actually going on. 4. Shoot for total quality. Don't shave standards. 5. Break things. Welcome destruction. It's the first step in the creative process. 6. Take risks. Don't play it safe. 7. Realize that right and wrong doesn't exist; it's only defined by society. 8. Question the nature of your consciousness. Look around and define the properties that make reality real. 9. Live your life as if there is no afterlife. 10. Do everything you've always wanted to do. Take enough precautions to never get caught when doing anything illegal and then do it with confidence as though you couldn’t get caught. 11. Realize that your culture is not 'right' culture. A culture that hates your nationality is neither wrong nor right. You hating that culture back is neither wrong nor right. 12. Stay alive.   So what do you think?  Do you agree?  I sure do, it's how I live most of my life.  And so far it's worked.

      You're asking me an age old question, you realize that don't you?  Well, a las, I shall answer it for you.  As much as it wants, allowing for infinite wood, or an amount that is greater or equal to the amount that it would like to chuck. If there is less than the woodchuck would like to chuck, however, that is harder to define. They may chuck the entire load, or they may chuck a smaller amount, or, snubbing the smaller pile, they may not chuck any wood at all. It will have to recondition its wants in order to know how much wood it will chuck.

      I don't, that's for damn sure.  Or do I?  Will a title make me feel warm, fuzzy, and secure in knowing that people will realize I took a minute to find a suitable title to summarize this entry?  Oh well, enough of that.  What have I done in these past days?!  You're soo curious aren't you.  Well I can assure you, my answer is 0.  I have nothing, and I have done nothing of nothing all the time.  I am in a complete state of nothing nothingness.  If you can fathom that.  Heh, all though I've really done worth any mention is speak to Roxanne for an unimaginable amount of time almost every morning.  But besides that, the only word that comes to mind is sleep.  I did go to the library yesterday, I checked out:  Zero, the biography of a dangerous idea The culture of fear, why Americans are afraid of the wrong things Strange brains and genuis, The secret lives of eccentric scientists and madmen   A good choice indeed.  Now to read them.  I want to read them horribly, I wish I could just upload all the information to my brain instead having to take ample amounts of time to read them.  I read faster than most people, still, it's a process.  Oh well, not everything can be instantaneous.  So yes, life is boring right now, I'm still in the process of paying that $108 dollars I owe my parents.  Hopefully I get a fucking job so I can pay them off, buy stuff I want, and stop keeping a clean system, if you know what I mean ;)  Other than that it's all just here.  Oh, I can't believe I forgot, heh.  Chantal called me two days ago, and I sounded mad at her for the first 5 minutes or so because I thought she was another former friend of mine, but then I realized it was her.  I felt mean:(  Heh.   Random conversation:  Sweetpea: I hear a clicking sound in my room Sweetpea: I think it's my clock Sweetpea: Wait I don't have a clock, OH, it's my fan.  LoL!

      Today as it has been soo far this summer was another completly uneventful day.  Nothing really occured of any value at all.  I believe I woke up around 2 or 3 due to talking to Roxanne 'til about 5:40 or so.  I still don't usually wake up that late, but oh well.  From then on, I did nothing, until about 6 when my parent's almost made me go to my little sister's dance recital.  I ended up being stubborn, and didn't try to get dressed, and by the time they were leaving I was still not dressed.  So, they left without me.  So it was an ok day I suppose, it could be worse.  I could be sitting watch a boring dance recital.  Oh, I almost forgot, my phone call to Stormy cost me $104.  My dad was pissed about that.  He said I have to do things around the house to pay it back.  Hopefully I'll get a job VERY soon so I can pay that off without having to do random things around the house.  But other than that, nothing at all happened today.  Oh well, I'm off, I hope you're glad you can now comment Rox, I didn't like that Xanga, too "busy" so to speak.  I like this one, nice and simple:)

      Yes, as you may have guessed it's a new year, 2004 I believe.  And what has happened this year to me you ask?  Nothing I can quite remember that stands out in my memory.  I met a lot of strangers.  Online that is.  You know who you are.  Chantal, Elissa, umm...random people whose names slip my mind.  Yeah, crazy people, just like me.  Hmm..yes, life is going slowly.  Very slowly.  I'm applying for jobs all over the place, well 6 places to be exact.  Best Buy being my number one choice.  Besides that I've just being laying around, doing nothing at all.  Literally, nothing.  Oh well, I suppose I'll end it now, not much more to say.  See, I told you guys it'd be boring (Roxanne).  Adieu.

      Hmm..I sitting on my bed at 5:30 or so A.M. and for some reason has the idea to write this.  And so I did, and this is what I came up with, so tell me what do you think?    GodSlave Machine    So lifeless, dull it may seem  Though with a push of a button  You, the God of the machine have brought it to life.  It exists ONLY for you.  Electricity pulses through the silvery solder and forest green boards  to enhance your life, and not its own.  So vivid and dead all at the same time.  The  lackluster keyboard in which you use to convey emotion  The monitor which shows you things you may never see in real life,  and will never know the TRUE  beauty of.  Yet, this satisfies you.  Soon you grow to have no care, but commanding this machine.  Nothing seems as real anymore, and conversations without a keyboard  leave you open and vulnerable.  And soon the machine controls YOU,  it breathes life into YOU,  you know longer know what it is to be real.  You are merely a slave...to the MACHINE.

      Yup, it's been a hella long time since I've posted, well it's all relative.  But, yes, I'm sure you're eager to know what's been happening with me.  Ha!  Well either way, you're lucky because I'm going to tell you anyways.  I mean that's why you're reading this right?  Hmm..let's see the first thing I can remember that I wanted to post was pretty fucking hilarious.  Roxanne had a lucid dream, and for some reason, she's not sure why, she wanted me there.  So she willed it, nothing happened for a little bit.  And then finally she says a little pencil drawn face of a black cat appeared.  Her mind could not find my image, how sad:(  I'm a pencil drawn cat.  I feel kinda special too, she said for some reason, I haven't asked that she is going to stop talking to all her guy friends, except me:)  Yup, that's good to know.  Hmm..I went to DCI in San Antonio, that was pretty fucking awesome.  I watched The Santa Clara Vanguard in the Lot, damn, they were fucking Godly!  I felt drained after I left.  That lot performance convinced me to try out for them when I'm about 19 or 20.  Damn, soo amazing.  That bus ride was hell, fucking cramped and shit.  Nice bus though.  I finally got my new Whitemax head, fucking beautiful sound coming out of my drum, now all I need is the Falam II on the bottom and I'm set.  The Drum key ended up being fucking small, and I'm not sure why?  Oh well, I'm going to return that.  Hmm..not much else happened that I can remember.  I went to Cindy's house for her little birthday thingaling and found out that she is extremely cute.  Being the idiot I am, I didn't think of getting her something.  But, oh, I will.  Which brings me to now, sitting here alone.  My family went to go watch a movie and well I didn't feel like going.  My mom says I'm not normal for obvious reasons, she says I should go out and enjoy life, I think I'm doing damn fine, but oh well.  That's about all, I downloaded three fucking awesome Tech house, and Goa songs today:)  Bye now.

      Yes, people have asked me when I will post a new, hmm, shall we call it, Blogit.  Yes, these little Blogits of mine have been entertaining some people so it seems.  So here I am to write another about my life.  I have done nothing really of any value at all, these past few days as usual.  Just slept a lot.  I'll go to sleep around 6 AM, wake up at 12 PM, and here I am, most of the time.  I ordered a new drum head and ratchet key, I was happy about that:)  I can't wait 'til it comes in.  And Domino's said they'd call me back on Monday.  So I finally actually have some money coming in.  And yup, that's all that has happened to me so far.  I think I shall leave you with some intellectual commentary done by me at an earlier time.  Heh.  Read on.  A bug. Ever system has a bug. The more complex the system, the more bugs. Transactions circling the earth, passing through the computer systems of tens or hundreds of corporate entities, thousands of network switches, millions of lines of code, trillions of integrated circuit logic gates. Somewhere there is a fault. Sometime the fault will be activated. Now or next year, sooner or later, by design, by hack, or by onslaught of complexity. It doesn't matter. One day someone will install ten lines of assembler code, and it will all come down.  If you really read into this, it's not just about computers and technology, rather you can interpret it as being about humans and their emotions, and someday something will get the best of them, and they will snap.
