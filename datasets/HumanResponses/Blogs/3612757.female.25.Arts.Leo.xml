      My polling station was inside a Catholic nursing home. The door was locked and the lady at the desk was talking on the phone. I stood there waiting for someone, anyone to let me. Finally, a nun passed by and after convincing her that my voter's card and lack of any other reason to visit a Catholic nursing home was proof of my legitimacy, she opened the door. I have the feeling she's been doing that all day. She craves the power.  I'm not happy about my choice but I've known what I would do for the past week or so. I toyed with the idea of using the last-minute-menu-ordering system - when unable to choose between several menu items, you wait until the waitress asks what you'd like and then blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. Lucky for me (and Canada) I made up my mind before then.  I was surprised to see a Marxist-Leninist candidate running in my riding. If the election wasn't so close, I might have voted for him. Instead, I did all I could do.

      Finding an apartment in Toronto is My Least Favourite Thing. I say that about many things and unfortunately, Vive remembers most of them so when I was rehashing the reasons why finding an apartment in Toronto is My Least Favourite Thing, she asked for clarification:  "You mean you hate it more than carrying the drink tray?"  Point. I have said, in the past, that carrying the drink tray - that cardboard tray for fountain pop cups from fast food restaurants - to and from the car is My Least Favourite Thing. I've said that a lot. My reasons are three-fold:  a) I'm the baby of my family. No one trusts me to do anything. I was NEVER given such a responsibility of the drink tray. If I looked especially clever that day, I might be assigned to carry the bag. More often than not, however, I was told, "You just get the door."  b) There's no glory in it. While you're checking those sad, pushed in lid tabs, giving up and finally sipping everything to determine which is the diet soda, someone else is handing out fries and becoming the hero.  and c) You can never have faith in the tray itself. It's recycled cardboard, it's flimsy, the cups don't quite fit. It's a risky affair and if you drop it, everyone is forced to drink milk with dinner and you KNOW who they'll blame. There's too much anxiety involved.  But apartment hunting is worse. Or that's what I believe right NOW.

      In the past two days, I've made two people cry. Not by being mean but by being the catalyst who delivers the final motivation for a pent-up emotional breakdown, with such careless phrases as "it's not a problem" and "you don't have to do anything right now". Tears, stomping away. At BOTH my jobs.  The saddest part is that I don't even react anymore. Watching people weep at work has become part and parcel with my paycheck.   Can I make you cry? I charge extra for the time I spend with you pretending it never happened.

      I was able to sleep in today which was fabulous. And while I have to go to work soon, this was very nearly a day off.

      I'm tuckered. Too much of "doing things" and "being places". Not enough "sleeping in my bed" and "staying home".  I'm stage managing a musical that's in rehearsals. When this is over I never want to hear music again. At least, not THIS music.

      I'm lazy. There it is.  (A huge aside: This e-mail from a friend:   It used to be that in order to make a difference in the world you had to GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING.   Well apparently through the magic of the internet THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE.   Just click on some of the clickie-buttons on this website every day to do all kinds of wicked, environmentally-responsible, proactive things! All without using your legs or head!    urlLink www.ecologyfund.com    I've made it my homepage, because I'm so lazy I don't trust myself to actually go to this website once the novelty wears off. Plus it will really cut down on the number of times I'll have to click. So already, I'm way ahead of the game.   I'm not THAT lazy.)  But I am lazy. So I've moved. Blogging is easier and I don't have enough substance as a writer to warrant a diary/journal. A blog of self-absorption is the best I can do. urlLink

      It's new.  But it is neither hip nor happenin'.  You'll need to find that elsewhere.

      The show I am working on ends this Sunday - in time for rehearsals for another show to start. I'm trading six actors who sing for two actors, one of whom doesn't speak at all. Do not be alarmed, it's not a mime. I'm working up to mime shows.  Does anyone remember the  Cheers  episode when Diane brings a mime into the bar and insists on using the French pronounciation of  mime ? Better yet, remember  Troop Beverly Hills ?

      No updates. Yes.  I'm tired and frustrated and angry. And well aware that I have no right to be. So in addition to being tired, frustrated and angry, I feel bad about it. ("I enjoy being a girl..." - Doris Day)  Also, my blog has become a forum for whining. Now I'll have to wear black, pierce something on my face and become 14 years old. I don't have that kind of time.
