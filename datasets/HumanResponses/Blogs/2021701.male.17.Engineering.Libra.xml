      College today was fun.. 9:30 - 11am only. I went to internet lab 11-12:30pm.. The lecturers were having a meeting of some sort. So, half day of Telecommunications.. Was kinda fun, cuz Jason was funny. Later, as I was waiting at the bench for mum and dad, suddenly I got a call. They went out with Uncle & Aunt for lunch. I had to eat myself. I went to the restaurant operated my the Hotel and Tourism (H&T) guys at my colllege. No 1st class service, but decent service lah. I had this pie that costed RM6.. reasonable lah.  I met Sean Paul. He's from Sarawak, dad's a politician, mum's Filipino. He's 23 now, but just 1 year my senior. He was studying Civil Engineering at INTI Sarawak, but middle into year 2, he sort flunked a couple of subjects a couple of times. Quit INTI Sarawak and decided to come to KDU Penang instead. His girlfriend's in Penang, so.. that's the main reason he's here. Ahh... Neway, we had lunch together.  The apartment we were looking to buy wasn't good. It housed sick patients, lotsa "tourists" looking for a spot to live. The apartment is very nice, but unfortunatelly, there are drug addicts lurking nearby... and lotsa sick people! Dang.. they're like waiting for medical attention in the hospitals nearby. The lifts are darn slow.. you'll prolly have to wait at least 10 minutes everytime! So stupid.   As for now, we're staying at our present apartment. Its abit far from college, but I'll be driving soon, so that's good =)  Remember to visit  urlLink My site  and  urlLink My blog

      Phew, end of the week already. Lets recap.  Thursday afternoon was BM classes with Puan Suraya. Today we did some Fahaman, and believe me, its much tougher than O Levels. No doubt I got credit for O's, but if I were to take the test here, I would surely merely Pass. It is a great experience, I can testify. I met some Hotel and Tourism guys. They're all a fun bunch. Breaktime, we went down the cafeteria.. For once we all had lots to sembang about. Kenneth was a fun guy... with anti American setiments. His ambition is to be chef is large cruise ships. Also, he had experience working at Shangri-la. Ah well..  Friday telecom class. The supposed test didn't turn out to be true. But Jason promised this coming Friday we'll have a test. The new National Service girl came. Forgot her name... but she's the pleasant type. Nothing much happened except the usual tech / telecom discussions. We're into networking and networking fabrics now... (i.e. telephone wires, coaxial, and fiber) Its fun!  Saturday, today went for Micro-app. We did some MS Dos commands and played around abit. It was basic, thus deemed boring by someone as leet as myself. Everyone knew how DOS worked. As usual, the challenging part of this subject is to put our knowledge in words. Thankfully, I have Computer Studies experience. Woot!!  Later I'll be off to BM for the weekend. I received an SMS from Radiance that I might be needed as backup singer for the youth meeting tonight. Can't wait for that :P Then, Sunday we'll attend church, then go to granny's. We're gonna get the orchard cleared up abit. I might have to go college on Monday by bus. Take the 7:30 from BM to Komtar, then, hop onto another bus to Burma / Anson Road hopefully by 9:30am where KDU is located. It has been done before, and its quite an exciting thing... for one, I'm a public transport virgin and for another... its like.. "independence" ya know.. Now that mum and dad are staying together with me, I'm pretty much under scruntany.. not that it's a bad thing.. but I love freedom.  So as usual, I'll be afk (away from keyboard) till Monday afternoon after college. Happy weekend, everybody! And visit http://bmbc.info , ok? Sorry about piptech.org not working!

      Last Friday, Telecommunications class with Jason. We started the more technical parts of Telecom now.. with complex Physics terminologies and such. It was okay, just need some reading up. We're far behind the schedule, cuz usually when we discuss about something, other things pop up! Ev3r so often, we're distracted from the original thing. I think we were talking about Radio waves & Communications. Then, he said something about Astro. We all know that Astro is satellite, and that's another topic.  So, Jason actually worked for Astro for a period of time. He brought up the issue of hacked Astro cards and said that Astro actually knew those who are stealing their services. A mate of mine said that his whole neighbourhood are using hacked cards. I mean, pay a one time fee, and you're FREE from pesky subscription charges. It costs about Rm 130 a month for all packages here in Malaysia, so, in a year, its about Rm 1500 in fees. Then, he talked about spot beams... that Astro has a big "footprint", yes.. basically, if you're in China, India or Philippines, or even West Australia, you can get Astro reception. However, a concentrated "beam" is sent to an area (for example, Kampong Beribi in Brunei).. then, the computer calculates how many signals "reflect". Its sort of like a "ping" and then, they check with their subsciption records for people who paid. If they get more "pings", that means someone's not paying.  Actually, its kinda foolish for people not wanting to pay AT ALL. It'll be too obvious dammit! I wonder what guts it took you to go to the Astro office and say, "I don't want your service anymore". I mean, Astro is god. There's no other competition, and its programs are top dawg, other that the annoying local ads. If you don't pay a cent, you're telling them "I have a dish at home... er.. I ain't gonna use it". So, word of advice for hacked cards users "pay the cheapest subscription (and use your hacked card)". If you don't pay at all, they know something is going amiss.. If convincted, you'll be fined Rm 100,000 here in Malaysia and possible jail sentence; doesn't matter whether or not you produced the cards, as long as you're using it.  Btw, my Telecom lecturer happens to be an "ex" American grad phone phreaker, and hacker. He's Malaysian chinese but the accent, attitude and all is there =) Owns an audio shop, I believe, with RM60k turntables at his disposal and WiFi network at home :P Very fun guy. Today (thursday), there's gonna be a Engineering Society meeting with elections and all, basically an AGM. Hope I get selected.. thus improving my chances for a merit scholarship :P  Later that day, came back, rested. Arrived BM at 4pm, picked up a church friend, and set off for Sungai Petani. Its actually about 50 km away... but accessable via highway. In case you don't know.. the highways here have 110km/h speed limits, thus... its not "luar biasa" if you see cars zooming at 140-160km/h. Speed traps are set tho.. and you have the option to (a) bribe the cop (b) give lame excuse and escape altogether (c) pay the fine. Hahah..  Arrived at  urlLink Cinta Sayang Golf and Country Resort  by 6:30pm. Tonight tho, some church members hadn't arrived yet. That night, it was dinner by the golf driving range. FOUR!  Next morning, more friends came. Almost everybody was there. The Youth, little kids and adults were separated into their separate groups with Ps. Alex Chong ministering to the adults, Unc. Micheal and Aunt. Hannah with the Youth (fun guys) and their daughter Joanne playing with the kids. If you look through the  urlLink photos here , basically, it tells you the whole story lah.  Throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there was non stop, high octane action and amusement. Certainly there was time of worship and bible teaching, then the games, and the swimming in the evenings. The thing about camps is that, for the first days, you really think its tiring and a bore, and when its time to head home, you miss it. Luckily, I was well prepared (mentally)!! And.. actually loved the whole experience.  urlLink Aiyah.. just browse through the pictures lah! .  I made new friends, and grew closer to older ones. It was fun. The activities organised were well planned and all. uncle Shannon, an entertainer by profession showed kids, youth and adults alike some of his "geng" magic tricks. Phew.. such fast hands to deceive the eyes, and the mind.  Monday, packed, and went home with a teary eye. Not teary because of missing the camp, rather the thought of gaining knowledge of the one and only God almighty and the lessons learnt. Arrived home by evening and was too tired.. just slept till 9pm before going for dinner. Tuesday, still in BM, we did absolutely nothing. Mum had the clothes washed, dad did the gardening, I watched TV (no computer there!!). Evening visited granny tho, and the Siamese temple my dad grew up in. Too bad I was out of "ammo" to take pictures of the temple. Recently our Chief Minister  urlLink Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon  visited the temple and He and His guys were tasting some "masakan kampung". They liked the Thai dish "kilek" so much that they promised to return for more soon! Apparently, the temple's chef's secret was excessive "santan".... That's what granny said. Granny could cook better "kilek"! She's got a tree in the orchard.  Oh, and its durian season again. Finally, after a year of fruitlessness, those thony fruits have finally sprouted. Its not fully riped, but when it is, it'll automatically drop down. Durian tree is a special tree which requires minimal attention yet producing rich, tasty fruits. There were about 40 trees brearing fruits... kinda cool to see all those durians on the trees. Maybe in a month or two, we should have some fruits ;-) I'll report to you the taste and all. There was also campedak fruit and other small ones. We left granny's at 7pm, and tapau some kampung eggs. Small and cute, but yummier than "normal" eggs. It is said kampung products are always better than the mainstream. Its true! I wonder what about kampung "chics" ;-) ;-) ;-)  Wednesday (yesterday).. at 9am, we went to the IC department to collect mum's MyKad. After 6 months+ of processing, its finally done. I took control of the car, while parents lined up. And a minute later, I was lucky enough to land in a parking slot. Whopee. Oh, earlier the previous night, I drove from the dinner place (Tenang restaurant) back home. Its about 1km+, but my driving was near flawless. So smooth, so lancar. I'm leet now. Afternoon, I rushed to this courier service to collect my mail. I won this voucher for Rm 100 in Thai food in KL. Gonna give it to my sis. Then, was slightly late for Maths class. There was a test today, so we were pretty spread out. It was all on Surds and Rational Numbers. I think I did okay, with 1 or 2 errors. But what the heck. Its 10% of the semester total, but yeah.. I did fine.  Thursday. My day started at 3am. Wanted to watch the Chelsea Champion's League match. Watched for a good 10 minutes then said to myself "Argh.. i'm no chelsea supporter! Everyone knows I love  urlLink Man United . What the heck? I went online instead and was surprised to find  urlLink San Fui  online. Talked to her abit. Apparently she was under exam stress. Sigh~ sometimes other people expect too much, and when numbers are programmed into your mind, your "panic quotient" just skyrockets. If you're kind hearted, ask her to calm down and think less about all the worries lah. Full time, Chelsea 2 - Monaco 2.. Monaco meets Porto in the Champion's League Final. Visit  urlLink Soccernet  for full report. Ah well, the team that narrowly beat Man United contraversially is now in the Finals. Nevermind. Its all right. Its 11am now, and I'll rest abit before going for BM classes this afternoon. After that, there's a 2 hour Eng. Society meeting, so look forward to that. I might report back tonight, if given the opportunity.  Thanks for visiting, and sorry for the server downtime.  urlLink Pinchpenny is cheap, but sucks . Oh, tell everyone you know about Piptech.org by adding this "signature" to your e-mail... or by word of mouth of MSN. Tell 'em "Visit piptech.org today!" =) I owe you one, dude and dudettes!

      Sorry about the slighly blurred pictures. My hands were shakey... or perhaps I didn't know 100% how to use this digital camera. Seems like good ol' fashion ones take better pictures. Sigh~ Advancements... one step forward, two step backwards!  I think I can claim that there are a good 100 "clear" pictures lah.. tell me which ones you're interested in ;) Good day, all! Mail me: pip@piptech.org if you are a BMBC youth who wants to try out this "blogging" thing.

      Here's what I read today... Just want to share   Sometimes it doesn't take much to get us down, does it? An unkind remark from a friend, bad news from the auto mechanic, a financial set back, or misbehaving child can put a cloud of gloom over everything, even on the sunniest day. You know you should be joyful, but everything seems to be against you, making simple tasks a struggle.  David must have been feeling that way when he wrote Psalm 6. He felt weak and sickly, troubled, forsaken, weary, and grief-stricken. But he knew what to do when he was down. He looked up and trusted God to take care of him and to see him through.   When we look up and focus on God, something good happens. We get our eyes off ourselves and gain a new appreciation of Him.  Next time you're down, try looking up to God. He is sovereign; He loves you; He considers you special; He has a purpose for your trials.  Yes, life can seem unbearable at times. But don't let it keep you down. Meditate on God's goodness, talk to Him, and know that He hears you. That will give you strength to get up when you're down.  Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish - Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel; Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish: Earth has no sorrow that heav'n cannot heal.

      In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. That's where the phrase, "goodnight, sleep tight" came from.  The phrase "rule of thumb" is derived from an old English law which stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider than your thumb.  It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the "honey month" or what we know today as the "honeymoon."  In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King & the King gave them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K. (Fornication Under Consent of the King) on it. Now you know where that came from..

      Scam alert! I got this in my e-mail and I feel suspecious!  From Marc Hunter   reply to: hunter/xxxx... (lotsa stuff) Subject: Could you please verify your e-mail address!  Hi there, You are receiving this message because automated spam detection software has flagged your recent email to me as suspicious, and it did not recognize your email address. If you simply reply to this message, your original message will go through and you will not be asked to do this again. Sorry for the incovenience, and thank you for your understanding. Rgds, Marc   I warn against replying. I have a sneaky feeling that if you DO reply, you'll be subjected to bombardment of pr0n advertisements and spam. I know of no "marc hunter" and certainly didn't e-mail him. I bet that he e-mailed everyone on Hotmail, and if you reply, you're telling him "Here I am... now, send me pr0n spam."  Good day, all.. I'm off to college soon and meet up with  urlLink Ruth

      A poor man in Ireland was plodding along toward home, carrying a huge bag of potatoes. A horse and wagon finally drew alongside him on the road, and the driver invited the man to climb aboard. After getting on the wagon, he sat down but continued to hold the heavy bag.        When the driver suggested that the man set the bag down in the wagon, he replied, "I don't want to trouble you too much, sir. You are giving me the ride already, so I'll just carry the potatoes."       "How foolish of him!" we say. Yet sometimes we do the same thing when we attempt to bear the burdens of our lives in our own strength. No wonder we become weary and overwhelmed with anxiety and fear.       In Psalm 55, David spoke of anxiety he felt because his enemies were attacking him (vv. 1-15). But then he gave his concerns to the Lord and was filled with renewed hope and confidence (vv.16-23). That's why he could write, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you" (v. 22)       When we recall the story of the man and his bag of potatoes, remember the simple lesson it illustrates: Rather than trying to bear your burdens by yourself, set them down in God's hands.       Give Him each perplexing problem, All your needs to Him make known;     Bring to Him your daily burdens - Never carry them alone!    Just want to share these words

      Well, am in college now. I'm having a 10:15 - 11:15am break courtesy of the Semiconductor lecturer, Mr Babu. Apparently, some guys from Northumbria, UK are coming over to check the facilities and the programmes here. He's one of the main guys of this School of Engineering, so.. he has to be present. Btw, this semiconductor class is the most hardest subject this semester. Thankfully, the others are reasonably easy.  Driving today just improved. More lancar now. I'm hopeful that by this coming Saturday, I will be allowed to drive to Church for the youth meeting :P woot woot.  Tests are coming up. We're almost approaching the middle of the term. Wow, time flies.  I'm very happy because the blog at  urlLink BMBC Youth  is doing great. We have Jason, Daniel and Vivien on board now, so.. I'm anticipating an active blog like  urlLink these girls . Maybe by the end of the month, we should have about 10 bloggers. Wheeee!!!  In other news, I'll be going mountain climbing (more like a hill) with Aunt Lily tomorrow morning. Class tomorrow only begins at 2pm, so that's good. We'll wake up at 6:30 and be there by 7:30am. Its gonna be a good exercise as the last time I remebered exercising was....  Anyhow, life has been great as usual. College friends are great, and I've grown closer to a few. Basically, with that, I can get and offer help whenever necessary. Its good to build a network of study partners. Meanwhile, I need to work on my internet addiction. I think I spend close to 20 hours a week surfing the internet and on other net related activities (chat, surf, mail, blog, website management). Hope to cut that down before the exams.

          Today, May 11th is Adele Poh's birthday!   In other news, there will be only 5 "posts" on the mainpage. This is to encourage fresh content. So, if you wanna see older posts, just click on the "archives". Glad to finally have Jason on. Hope that we all can post some encouraging e-mail and forwards on this blog.  As for the layout, I hope to get a nicer one soon.  urlLink Check this out ... hope to get help from these people :P Also, there is a function to "Upload" files, more specifically pictures. So, please resize pictures to MAXIMUM  320x240  pixels or else it would look ugly. Thanks!  So today I'll again be driving to college with dad by my side. This will go on for the whole week, then next week I'll be alone. Its fun, and abit nervy, but I can cope. Good day and enjoy the new layout!

      I am in too.. Well, guess I would have one more thing to do every time when I go online starting from tonight, that is to keep updated with you bloggers. I'm glad all of us pool our resources and time together to form a virtual cafe where we can keep in contact always. Sad :) I have one month time before I leave my hometown, guess it would be a long long time before I'll be back in BM after I left.  It would be great to see that this blogging thingy can last, hope it is publisized officially and permanently as our BMBc Youth's online cafe. "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven." Matthew 5:16

      Welcome to the blog, Vivien! Glad to have you on board! It would be great if we could invite Jason, Daniel.. and anyone not in BM in 3-4 months time to blog with us. That way, we can continue to keep ourselves updated on things and happenings in our lives.  Well, the Sarawak pictures are up  urlLink here  so do check that out. Otherwise, you still can see Keston's Contributions  urlLink here .  I'm in college now, Learning computer fundamentals. Its really fundamental to me, but the class is going at snail pace.   In other news, I managed to "hack" one of our friend's e-mail. Its mainly due to weak passwords. SO a word of advice, create tough to guess passwords in the future.. like... ph1Lip90210 or some weird combination! :D Good day all!

      Finally there is some life at piptech.org .. but guess what? They screwed up all my files! They're all gone! All my hard work in setting up piptech.org!! GONE!!   I'm in BM now. I drove mum to The Summit, a shopping mall. Its Mother's Day.. and she's being pampered at the hair saloon. I'm now at the Cybercafe lah. Wow.. I drove from church, to makan place and back home.. These are not ordinary big wide streets. These are the streets of ancient Bukit Mertajam.. Where.. there are NO rules. I survived and am glad.  Parking at the basement was thrilling. COntrolling the clutch and brakes. Thank God I didn't make any scratch on dad's car. My driving is leet. Tomorrow (Monday).. I'll drive to college, with dad by my side. Will see how it goes! I'm overly excited! :P :P  Later, we'll be going home, and do some gardening. The orchard at Granny's is almost done... and maybe next weekend, we should be getting some durian now... This coming week, college will be exams on Friday and small quiz on Tuesday.  Oh, and church has some plans this weekend. Firstly, we're visiting the hospital and doing a dance to entertain the sick. Its all part of our church's community services. So.. its gonna be fun hangin' out with my buddies after Sunday service. As for Sat. youth meeting, I'll be worship leading. Phew! Yesterday, I was backup singer.. now I lead? Big step.. but I'm confident I can deliver! Heheh  Youth is a small group of 20ish. The pastor is Ps. Tamil.. he's the Charismatic type. A bit disturbing, but I'm starting to accept him now. We were all uncomfortable with his style of ministrying to us youths, but I guess we can all compromise. So, next week, worship lead (whooppee).. and that's about it.  Gday all. And thanks for staying faithful (despite piptech.org being down).

      What I read today...  Grant Murphy of Seattle was the active type, a man who ran at full throttle. Idling and coasting were not in his nature. "One might even call him hyperactive," recalled a dear friend.  	The multiple sclerosis began to slow Grant down. First he needed crutches to get around. Then he was limited to sitting in a chair. Finally he was confined to a bed.  	Near the end, he was hardly strong enough to talk. His friend recalls, however, that "he expressed only joy and thankfulness with a constant anticipation of being in the Lord's presence." Not long before he died, Grant whispered Romans 15:13 to a friend. He repeated the words "in believing," then added, "I can't do anything now."  	It's when we can't do anything that God does everything. And herein lies a profound paradox of the Christian's experience. Faith is simultaneously an exercise of our will and the impartation of divine strength. And from that marvelous mixture spring joy and peace and an abundance of hope.  	Are you in a total helpless situation? Strength gone? All options exhausted? If you have trusted Jesus as your Savior, God will Strengthen you to keep on believing. As you trust Him, He'll give you not only joy and peace, but also hope when all hope is gone.  When we are weak and in despair,  Our mighty God is near; He'll give us strength and joy and hope, And calm our inner fear.  No one is hopeless whose hope is in God...

      Just want to share what I read...  In his book Christians in the Marketplace, Bill Hybels says that people outside the faith often say, “Show me” before they say, “Tell me.”  	I knew a young man in Germany named Wolfgang who modeled Hybels’ principle at a building site where he worked. As an enthusiastic believer, Wolfgang always read his Bible during lunch. Though his fellow workers jeered, he didn’t stop his daily reading. He simply prayed for a way to demonstrate Christ’s love for them.  	When the workers went home at night, they always left their muddy boots behind. Wolfgang began staying late after work to clean their boots. The men were puzzled at first but then realized that Wolfgang was the only one among them who would perform this humble service. Not only did they come to respect him, but sometimes they even asked him to read the Bible to them. Only eternity will reveal the full effect of Wolfgang’s shining life. But this we know: When his co-workers saw his good works, they started listening to his God.   	Jesus said, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may... glorify your father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16). If you long to lead the people around you to Jesus, radiate His Love by doing practical deeds for God’s glory alone.  My life was dark until the Light shone in, That Light was Christ, who saved me from my sins; His light that I’ve received I long to share In loving deeds for people everywhere.  A Christian’s life is a window  through which others can see Jesus.

      Well... a surprising news. A 30 year old soon-to-be KING marrying a 17 year old girl that  urlLink my friend, Fui  used to play "Barbie Doll" with. Wow.. =) I'm shocked.  Congratulations to Prince Billah & Dk. Sarah binte Pengiran Haji Salleh Abdul Rahman. They're next in line to the throne.   urlLink from Brudirect.com   In other news, worship leading during youth meeting went well. We had a short 15 minute discussion about Conflicts. I'll type out the text when I have time. Very interesting. Anyhow, you can always search Google on conflicts.. :) Its good to know these sort of things.  The English premier league is over, and Ronaldo and Fletcher will be missing the final due to the red cards receieved during the last game of the season. That sucks. But I'm sure we can beat Milwall this coming Saturday, 9pm on Astro Supersports ;)  Sunday came and went. Nothing unusual.. We went to granny's orchard. We ate some durians and now I'm home. I think there's a test this week, now.. which subject it is..

      Since I'll be back less than a month from now.. I guess it's best that I can keep in contact with you bros and sis in Christ.

Thank God, the Youths and church camp helped a lot to bring me back closer to you.

      God sure knows how to teach His children.  Just now, at class around 11am, the Microapp teacher was teaching us to use Excel.. and asked us to draw a plan (diagram) using Excel. It was as fun as eating sand! Well, after finishing, she inspected my work, and concluded that it wasn't complete.  With a sour face, and an inflated ego, I gave her the middle finger salute. Had a giggle with my friends, and yes... that WAS satisfying.  Driving home, near the "underpass"... I wanted to go to the left lane in order to reach home. After signalling for 10 secs, still they don't give way. Suddenly, I look in front and I was so close to the Merz's bumper.. I swirved left, and nearly hit this motor cyclist. Asshole gave me the salute!  Haha.. isn't it amazing how God works?  Oh, I won't be going to Youth Meet today. Dad and mum have Malay wedding reception to attend. Oh well, guess I'll continue my Shrek 2 in CANTONESE, Confessions of hot chic and of course, Troy.. VCD galore.. and of course, study for my Semiconductor exams!

      Today after college, at 3pm ish.. I drove dad and mum to BM. This is the first time me driving across the famous Penang bridge. I nearly met an accident as there was a sudden "brake" near the Toll Plaza.. emergency braked.. luckily the air bags didn't pop up, or I get killed by the air bags!! lol..  it was frightening (for dad and mum).. I was reasonably cool and calm, altho abit shaken lah.. Overall, it thought me the "peraturan dua saat" I learnt once upon a time. Other than that, the whole journey to BM went smooth, I'm now l33t.  Talking about l33t.... Liang, Neil (collegemates) and I were on MSN talking l33t. Leet talk (or elite talk) is a language commonly used by hackers so that their messages cannot be intercepted or searched using a search engine. If I were to tell you "i'll be breaking into microsoft june 1st".. then, the FBI or whatever can Google these terms and find my website (gosh, no.. I don't have the experties to hack MS).  So, h4ck3r$ t4lK 1!k3 tH1$... and u$3 t3Rm$ l!k3 ph34r, l33t, p4wned (search around the web, there should be a leet dictionary somewhere). Its a fun language to learn and use while MSNing.. Rather than lousy SMS lingo.  Hi to cousin Li Tinh, Ruth, Jen, Radiance and all da nice people who managed to drop by piptech.org (through the bulletin board). Sorry for inconvenicen.. Just wanting them to post something in the Forums b4 arriving here.  =0  Neway, congrats to Vivi for getting Biochem, Danny for getting Dentistry (hey, its a blessing too.. u may earn your million in 5-10 years.. if u work hard!) also to Andreen (Chinese lit, whoa.. respect dude.. everytime I *try* to speak Manglish, u sure / can laugh at me... cuz I speak like ang-mo!) and to Jon.. whatever course u might be taking.. all da best!  =)  Dad and I watched the American Idol replay, the Finals on 8TV.... first song for Diana deGemuk was great, 2nd one abit lousy and 3rd one was a disaster. She was intimidated by Fantasia's wonderful performance.... Fantasia didn't start well, but her 2nd and 3rd song was out of this world. I'll buy her album when it comes ;) Remember Ruben Studdord, Clay Aiken and that Guy Sebastian (yea, Rach, I know u like him).  Listening to Bone Thugs, and D12. Gnite all, college at 9am tomorrow, hence 8am have to leave home, hence 7am have to wake up. And as usual, I'll be mia, afk (missing in action, away from keyboard) for the whole of Saturday and Sunday in Bukit Mertajam. ;-) Thanks for visiting!

      Well, yesterday was eventful. After the usual 2-5:30 pm date with Ms Voon, the Engineering Maths teacher, I headed for Komtar.. it was abit of a crawl.. but eventually, I found the BSN (bank simpanan).. the place where the badminton was on.  It was only about 6pm, so I went to Komtar there and Cybercafe-d.. Wasted RM 3 for an hour's of access, but what the heck :P At around 6:45pm, went for makan. I had yin yong.. which was excellent - at New Lane area.... 7:10pm, met the gang. And I was surprised!  Apparently, almost all of them are from Engineering. KDU Penang has 6-7 schools, but School of Engineering was the dominant one.. A few ppl I know, they're my senior. It was fun stuff, really.. cuz all of them played very well.. Even the girls were skilled. I had loads of fun, and oh.. I beat them all :P [brags]  Next Wed / Thu, I'll probably have supper with them. They usually have a gathering after the 9pm game... so that's kinda fun. Today, I'll skip badminton, my arms hurt badly... Its been 1/2 a year since I last played, see? But I was still reasonably at the top of my form. Wheee =)  Later that night, wrote some testimonials on Friendster and had fun ;) Nothing much happened, and I slept a bit late lah... 2:45am, my alarm woke me up. I woke up, shut it off.. and went back to bed. FC Porto and Monaco don't excite me. Probably the worst finals in Champions' League History! Ultimately, the class of Porto showed, and they won 3-0. Good for them... screw their coach! (who is apparently going to Chelsea next season).  Woke up as usual this morning... abit late, preparing my assignment (as below).. then 9:25am, went to the school computer lab to have it printed... Still got 50 pages in my Printing quota :-D must use puas puas! I'm staying back today for BM classes later with Puan Suraya... The cool teacha.. =) Gonna meet my buddies from H&T.. and have loadsa fun learning about the history of the Malay language, and how to improve my language in general.  5:30pm, shud reach home. Plan to sleep well, and rest my right arm... Still kinda hurts, and probably will read up my Semiconductor and Telecommunications and do some Maths. My Maths sucked. Only 8 marks out of 15.. and its all on Surds and rational numbers nia.. me so disgraceful. I can justify that my buddies also got around that region, highest being 8.75 marks nia.. but hey, gotta do better!!!  Man U has signed Alan Smith for 7 mil pounds. Well, he's a good buy, except his temper. He's known to get angered very easy. Surely will get lotsa red card wan, and tunnel burst up with his own team mate or manager. He's a tough guy, so.. hope he can score and provide for Man United in 90 days time. Till then, its boredom 100%!!! No footie, only Euro 2004.... But that's equally good too.  Next weekend, Olivia & Anthony are coming to Penang for a wedding, and on Sunday, dad and mum are going to KL for a wedding... So, they carpool and dad and mum take bus back to Penang lah. I'll be driving them, so that's l33t.  I've been starving myself the past few days.. eating less and all. Hopefully, my waist can reduce sikit to less then 36' lah... (now its around 37') and my weight, target: 160 pounds, 70kg... (now at 165 pounds oredi). I've been badmintoning abit, so my leg muscles are leet now... So firm. =) Sigh, how I wish my whole body was as mascular!  Do post in the  urlLink Forums / Community Discussion Boards . Start a topic, reply to a post.. just say anything that's on your mind. ALL ARE INVITED and your post will make me smile ;-)   Thank you.

      Today, as I was browsing the net, doing the usual online stuff, and of course the occasional thought about my Uni application feedback. This verse comes to mind :   29 He gives power to the weak, And to those who have no might He increases strength. 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, 31 But those who wait on the Lord Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint.  ISAIAH 40:29-31  Wassup everyone?Hope you guys are doing great. As for me, things are just the usual..Hoping and Praying for the best... God bless ya everyone alwiz !!!

      let a = 1 and b = 1 a = b a2 = ab a2 - b2 = ab - b2 (a+b)(a-b)=b(a-b) a+b=b b+b=b 2b = b 2 = 1 !  Huh? 2 equals 1?

      DeGemuk? So harsh on her, anyway she doesn't understand!!  Let me clarify It wasn't all because of "symphaty votes" the fact is LaToya London's hometown had a power failure so the phone wasn't working...... I read bout it from The Star few weeks ago  those hum-sup lous should cast their vote for the Miss Universe contest, not the American Idol! They ruin the whole show!!

      Deep in a Wyoming canyon I came across the biggest porcupine I've ever seen. As he lumbered toward me, I watched him closely and gave him plenty of room. I was not about to get near a guy whose quills looked like missiles. No wonder he was alone!  But he's not alone all the time. Every November and December, porcupines get close enough to produce offspring. During that time they choose to relax their quills, then they return to their prickly selves.  In nearly every church, there will be porcupine or two, with sharp quills of criticism or sarcasm or arrogance. We want to avoid them, but God places us in communities of believers for fellowship. He commands us to love one another - including the porcupine types. And in our honest moments, we have to admit that we have quills too.   John wrote, "He who loves God must love his brother also" (1 John 4:21). To do this, we need to ask God to help us "relax our quills," even when other people are prickly. The Holy Spirit will help us stop being so defensive or critical or controlling, and enable us to love our Christian brothers and sisters. It's the way we show the world that we love God (John 13:35).  Some people can be difficult to love  And so we do not even try to care, But God says, "Love them just as I've loved you You'll bring Me glory as My love you share."  God loves you and me - let's love each other!

      Ya Some say we "halau" Pastor !!!! Some say it's not entirely our wrong !!!!(Just some conflict Pastor can't handle !!!!)  For me ( i was there that day ) it's misunderstanding that spark the flame !!!  Let's forget it "if we can" and learn from it !!!  Look at 3 of our "most wanted" weaknesses 1) not punctual = late 2) come empty handed = without notes even some without bible 3) low attendance = very very low (maybe low tide) others are the worship .... etc....  Hoping to see everyone in the coming youth meeting Maybe without the usual Pastor Tamil but i got latest news that negotiation is going on .....  Bye C ya

      Dear Youths Of BMBC,  It's been GREAT growing up and learning from all of you... I truly appreciate all the good times and bad times we have all gone through together as BMBC Youths. No matter what happens we know that God will always deliver us through each hurdle in our lives... The times that we have spent and shared, I will cherish it... Thank you all and may God bless all of you in everything that you do.  Until the time we meet again, I'll do my best to keep you all updated and in touch with me while I'm in Kuala Lumpur pursuing my studies and my dream. I'm going to miss all of you and the whole congregation of BMBC as a whole.   Take care and remember to "Puji Tuhan" always!!!  Bye for now.

      WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?  Love. Forgiveness. Mercy. Grace. Goodness. Compassion. Kindness. Generosity.  Who in the world would be against these characteristics? Who could oppose such positive forces in a person's life? In other words, who could call Christians nasty names, consider them dangerous, and seek to put as much distance as possible between themselves and Christians?  Who? Many people. But why? It's because in the Christians they already know, they do not observe love, forgiveness, compassion, goodness, kindness, mercy, grace, and generosity.  They won't see Christ and His attributes if we're standing in the way. If we have a self-serving agenda or cause, they'll see our hate instead of our love, our grudges instead of our forgiveness, our indifference instead of our compassion, our harshness instead of our goodness. Our lives need to be consistent with the message we proclaim.  Christianity is about Christ and His loving, forgiving, and compassionate gift of eternal life. Anything we do that reflects something else gives others the wrong idea.  It's all about Jesus. Let Him shine through your life so that others can see Him. Show me the way, Lord, let my light shine As an example of good to mankind; Helps them to see the patterns of Thee, Shining in beauty, lived out in me.  Live So That Others Will Want To Know Our Savior.

      I read the mail that Anonymous sent, and I've something to say.    Well,I have a few comments for the BMBC youth !! I wonder how pastors have this church halau.I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records. It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors. If you ppl do not like how the way pastors preach, I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes.And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again.  Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude.Especially saying they suck.If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!!  So there!!!!    First of all, whoever you are, I hope you're reading this. I appreciate your concern for the youth group, and with you wanting to tell us what you think about the youth group is good, but please, if you want to do so, do it by also including your name, and your info. No, you cannot just send comments from your side of view/story and not allow us to defend ourselves and enlighten you with our side of the story. Don't you think you're being unfair? Like a kid who refuses to listen to anyone, stubborn & stone-hearted, not willing to listen to others.   Quote:  I wonder how pastors have this church halau.I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records.    From that sentence, you don't seem to be one of the youths. Not someone who belongs to the church. If not, wouldn't you have known if there was a case of "halau-ing pastor" as you call it? But anyway, let me tell you, I've been in BMBC all my life, and NO, we've not chased any pastors away before. Don't be silly, our pastors are voted, discussed, put on probation before hiring, if we didn't like them, we can just NOT vote for them. Oh, you think it'll set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records? Then I think you can also join their "list-of-cowards" for not having the courage to even tell us your name. Anonymous? HAH!   Quote:  It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors. If you ppl do not like how the way pastors preach, I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes.   Please, enlighten us. How do we treat pastors? You said pastors, plural. So it means we treat pastors terribly. If you have the guts, name the pastors and tell me how badly we treat them. Thanks. So, if WE don't like the way pastors preach, it means we're too stuck-up to admit our mistakes? Ah, what a nice definition. I wonder who taught you that? God? Are you saying that pastors don't make mistakes? Pastors are holy & righteous that they don't make mistakes? Let me tell you something. Nobody is perfect, and yes, pastors are not perfect either. Different pastors have different ways of preaching and YES, sometimes the way they preach just doesn't suit us, so we tend to dislike the pastor. It doesn't mean that we don't admit mistakes. I've met so many pastors & I've heard many of them speak, tell me why do I love some of them so much? It's just the difference of mankind. Don't be unreasonable.   Quote:  And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again.   I agree with Philip on this. Why must we, avoid looking like real idiots, just because you say so, or Pastor Tamil says so? It doesn't matter how good we are, or how terrible we are. We are singing praises to our Lord, and that's all it matters. Our focus is God, not pleasing the audience. It doesn't matter if BMBC Youth are playing, or Altered Frequency, or Planet Shakers or Hillsongs. The one and only reason is to worship God. If God is unhappy with the worship, let Him deal with us. Who are you to say anything? If you don't like it, why don't you come and lead worship someday? I'll be glad to give you a chance. Just let me know.   Quote:  Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude.   I totally agree. But who are you talking about? As far as I'm concerned, the youths of BMBC did not chase away Pastor Tamil. No, we didn't hold brooms & asked him to go away. No, we didn't say we didn't want him to come to our meets anymore. We did no such thing. Get your facts straight. Who said we HALAU-ED pastor?   Quote:  Especially saying they suck.    That was a mistake. He apologized, didn't he? The Bible teaches us to be forgiving, right? So what are you doing now? Keeping a grudge?   Quote:  If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!!   Once again, you're using plural. Who are THEY? Well, YOU think it's bitingly good. I don't. Sue me for having a different opinion. You're talking as if we can't have different views about other people. Are you just being totally unreasonable or are you trying to be God?   Yup. That's my opinion. Don't like it? Well, I don't care. Come talk to me face-to-face if you have the guts, and we'll talk it out. I'm Radiance Leong, in case you don't know. I'm the Youth Leader of the youth group, you have probs with us? Come talk to me. I'm always open for opinions. -peace- God bless!

Can u please deal directly with Sir "Chief" Morgan , he's the "Chief" so u should tell him so that he can address to us about your comments !!! By hook or by crook , we are still One In Christ (OIC) !!! Once again "Walk the Talk"  Pls note, i'm Keston a.k.a. "z.OR.ro_VIR.a.GO" at least i'm not someone "Anonymous" my viewpoints are mine and only my own viewpoints !!!

       Here's what I got from an e-mail... was meant to be a comment to one of the postings of BMBC's Youth.    Well,I have a few comments for the BMBC youth !! I wonder how pastors have this church halau.I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records. It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors. If you ppl do not like how the way pastors preach, I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes.And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again. Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude.Especially saying they suck. If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!! So there!!!!    First off, I would like to thank "Anonymous poster" for his or her comments.  "I wonder how pastors have this church halau". Sorry, please rephrase.  "I think it would set a new record in The Malaysia Book of Records." Well, if you think so, then, go tell them to make this new category.  "It's kinda terrible how you ppl treat pastors." How do we treat them? I dunno myself. Tell me about it! Btw, do you come to the Youth Meets?  "I guess you're to stuck up to admit your mistakes" What mistakes? Tell us!  "And the worshippers or musicians who were ambarassed by Ps.Tamil , i think they should brush up on their musical skills if they wouldn't want to look like real idiots again." Its EMbarrased. My personal opinion, and I might be wrong is that BMBC's musical talents are the finest in Bukit Mertajam.. I couldn't wish for any better. And who are you to comment on the Youth's musical skills? This is worshipping God! If God is unpleased with our worship or musicians, let Him deal with it. You shut up.  "Well, i guess there's nothing more to say accept halau-ing pastors are very wrong and very rude" No doubt you're right here!  "Especially saying they suck" Well, I take that back. Sorry. Apparently, Malaysia is not a free world after all. No place to express one's personal opinion. Btw, the church hasn't pay me my RM 250 for bmbc.info and the hosting space.. Hmm.. Mr. Morgan?  "If you're that clever, why don't you try going up yourself and preach a message as bitingly good as theirs!!!!" I would. I really would. Never did anyone say that he/she is more clever than the pastor. But as human with senses, we know an [insert favourite adjective here] when we see one.  "So there!!!!" What's your point?  Oh, and anonymous, next time, when posting, at least include a contact number, name or e-mail address or at least a "nickname" so I can address you properly!  Its no point listing down all Ps. Tamil's weaknesses and our "beef" with this dude. For He is God's servant. So.. yes, you're right in stating that we need to respect him. Like I said earlier, sometimes, us DEMANDING youths need someone we can relate to. And if one or two have a problem with a particular "person", then, its an isolated case. If almost everyone have differences with an individual, then, I don't see any sin in evaluating and acting on this individual.  Good night =)

      Friday June 18 2004 Jit Sin teacher's day!  The highlight of the day is undoubtedly The Ever Ready Teachers versus The Kaki Bangkus Prefects in a entertaining high scoring match! The match was an one sided affair and the final score, an embarrassing 5-0 lose for the prefects! Even our own church leader Sir Ravi Samuel got into the act, scoring a brace and with his commanding defensive role,the students voted him the Man Of The Match. However there's no prize for the winner nor the Man of the Match.

      Church History By Ps. Tamil July17,2004  All through the years the church was persecuted but they were growing in number, in strength, in holiness and spirituality. Until AD64, an emperor by the name of Nero came into power in the Roman Empire. This man masterminded the persecution against Christian. He sat the city of Rome on fire and then blame it on the innocent Christian. * Software giant Nero got it’s logo and name from this incident! Then on, official persecution against the church broke out. Christian then became the enemy of the nation and they were to suffer all kinds of persecution.  Until AD324, Constantine came into power. “Tradition or belief” supposed that he had an encounter with God. * But the bible didn’t state anything alike. He was at the verge of losing a war when he saw a cross. *Because it’s tradition, when “things” passed down through the ages, common sense tells you to doubt it! So some dudes try to add some authenticity to it and say he saw two words which mean Christ. Miraculously Constantine’s army won the war. So after the war, he made Christianity legal and Christian started to return to the church.  Around AD392, Theodisius was in full control and he gave privileges to those out there, if and only if he or she is a Christian. Thus this brought in non-Christian as they too wanted to be privileged and not to be saved. Worst of all, they “naively” bring in all types of idols into the church……..  Ps Tamil also spoke about the papacy(pope), Lutheran, Ana Baptist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Anglican, Methodist, about the Pentecost and how the “tongue” came about through the century of recovering the truth and the primacy of the scripture restored!  Sorry! I cannot or should not continue further! Join us every Saturday, 8-9.30 pm at BM Baptist Church from 17 July to 21 Aug! If you really can’t attend those meetings, vcd(s) for every session is available at RM7 each. For enquiries, call: 04-3240307, 012-4142690.

      I had the wildest nitemare during my afternoon nap!  Ever since the last O Level paper, I made a promise to myself not to think back of the past. If we continue to miss one another, then, there can be no progress, or progress is hindered. I succeeded in not thinking too much about my Brunei friends. Occationally, there's MSN, and e-mailing. But we've gotta move on.  However, it all changed this afternoon. I dreamt of a dream so scary, that it was like a movie of friends separating. There was lots of emotion, deep feelings and what-nots. There were flashbacks of the times we spent walking to church (for midweek), doing councillor duties and those longwinded meetings, those classes where we played truant, those recess times we spent yakking, those boring homework and annoying teachers.   I love you guys!  Now i miss them all. It'll take a week for me to recover, but I'm hopeful. College after all, has been excellent. I love studying what I love rather than being stuck with irrelevant subjest like Bio, Chem, Eng, Malay (I love language activities, but not lessons)... So now, I have basically 2 days (6 hours) of computer studies, 3 hours of maths, 3 hours of phy, 3 hours of telecommunications, and soon, 2 hours of BM (for 1 semester only) - next semesters, will be Malaysian Studies and Moral.  Oh, today, 2 pretty girls quit the course. Apparently, it didn't suit their likings. Now, we're left with Su Chin, petite, and friendly.. and an Indian girl, very smart. The rest are boys, 17 in all. Grrr.... competition :-*(

      College today was fun.. 9:30 - 11am only. I went to internet lab 11-12:30pm.. The lecturers were having a meeting of some sort. So, half day of Telecommunications.. Was kinda fun, cuz Jason was funny. Later, as I was waiting at the bench for mum and dad, suddenly I got a call. They went out with Uncle & Aunt for lunch. I had to eat myself. I went to the restaurant operated my the Hotel and Tourism (H&T) guys at my colllege. No 1st class service, but decent service lah. I had this pie that costed RM6.. reasonable lah.  I met Sean Paul. He's from Sarawak, dad's a politician, mum's Filipino. He's 23 now, but just 1 year my senior. He was studying Civil Engineering at INTI Sarawak, but middle into year 2, he sort flunked a couple of subjects a couple of times. Quit INTI Sarawak and decided to come to KDU Penang instead. His girlfriend's in Penang, so.. that's the main reason he's here. Ahh... Neway, we had lunch together.  The apartment we were looking to buy wasn't good. It housed sick patients, lotsa "tourists" looking for a spot to live. The apartment is very nice, but unfortunatelly, there are drug addicts lurking nearby... and lotsa sick people! Dang.. they're like waiting for medical attention in the hospitals nearby. The lifts are darn slow.. you'll prolly have to wait at least 10 minutes everytime! So stupid.   As for now, we're staying at our present apartment. Its abit far from college, but I'll be driving soon, so that's good =)

      Well, Proton and Norwich are teaming up. In case you dunno who Norwich is.... check out  urlLink their page ! Next season, my first team will of course, be the mighty Manchester United, but my 2nd team, will be Norwich... Proton has signed up a sponsor deal with them, and they'll have their logo on their jerseys. Being a newly promoted club, I'm sure their jerseys are cheap (relatively).... So, that's my Christmas / Birthday wishlist... Size: L adult please, with the words Piptech and the Number 86, thank you =)  College later, Telecommunications with Jason. Should be fun. Then tomorrow, more Microsoft Word! Ahh.. 1st sem is like heaven! No one wanna blog wit me yet?

      Ah.. I'm in college now. Its 3:45pm and I'm in the middle of Engineering Maths 1. Ms Voon's a nice lady, very gentle and all.. so I guess she can excuse me for an extra 5-10 minutes (I'm supposed to be back in class by 4pm).  Yesterday night, 8:15pm, we arrived at Dewan Sri Pinang. We were kinda late, and already, my cousin Susan who works in Intel as an engineer was oredi there with my uncle and aunt whose daughters are taking part in this orchestra.  After the formalities and speeches by the Chief Minister of Penang, the thing started. I'm not really sure whether or not I like Classical, but I listen to the likes of Maksim and Koji guy... and I seem to click with this genre of music. I don't play it, but I guess I like it.   Jocelyn's solo was at 10pm that night, so we had to wait till after the interval. Stephanie, I think in Form 2/3 was playing the middle sized voilin. There was like.. so many mini-violinist (the standard size, held by the neck).. then, there's the bigger violin thingy (about 4 feet) and the bad boy, the big ass ones, that's almost 6 feet tall. Jocelyn, the elder of the sisters was playing the violin while her younger sister was on the middle sized one. I know they have specific names, but what the heck.  The thing I like about orchestra is the plucking part.. So soft, so uniquely sounded. Ahh.. Can't have enough of this shit.  At the interval, mum, cous, and I went for a pee break. Outside the auditorium, I saw a Maksim wannabe. He dressed like him, had a similar hairdo, and acted like him. So funny lah.. but I guess that's "fashion!".   Well, if you've visited the  urlLink Main site , you should have seen the many pictures I took. Boy, great looks always accompany great talents! Leng luis galore!  It ended at 11pm, but I didn't sleep till 2:30am... editing the pics, and fixing my webbie. Guess what, I woke at 6:30am, effectly sleeping for a mere 4 hours. Main reason was becuz I slept yesterday afternoon 3-6.. so, it sorta give me the extra "oomph!" I need to stay awake. It is said that short naps are much better than long sleeps. Maybe this tactic will be useful come exam time.  Nehow, My  urlLink sister's blog  is almost done. Still buggy with broken links.. but she's learning =) And I can't link to my sister's law firm's website cuz they might sue me... They specifically said that you mustn't link to their pages without prior consent. Dun wanna get trouble wit a law firm now, do I?  I've just uploaded a  urlLink plethora of Mp3s  available for download. Share the wealth! I'll blog more tonite!

      I spent Sat afternoon till early Monday in Bukit Mertajam. I attended youth meeting on Saturday night. Pastor Tamil talked about ways to hear God. This time, he also  talked diplomatically about the Process Theology bit. At least this time he offered his reasons why Process in his opinion, is wrong. That's what I wanted. Argh.. I can't remember what he said, but yeah.. I'm still not satisfied :P  Sunday service was like a "scolding" from this Charismatic pastor. You know, these charismatic people... so, weird... so rude, so right-to-the-point. How can we accept them if they were to lecture us as if we're little kindergarten kids. Nuff said... they suck.  Monday morning, 7:15 am, went for breakfast. 7:45pm, went to bus station. I took the bus from my hometown, BM to college. Wow.. it was thrilling! I manage to get to my college in time, thanks to an additional RM5 cab ride atop the Rm 3 for the bus fare. Overall, it was fun!  Computer today was boring. I've gotta be considerate for those who understand slower than me.. sigh~ But then again, it gives me free time to brush up on my semi-conductor, telecom and maths.. the other 2 days are computer studies... damn easy if you've took it in O levs.  I'm doing my church's youth website. In Dec last year, the visited Sarawak.. and they came back with loads of pics. Well,  urlLink here they are  in case you're curious. Some of them are my friends, some are from other churches in other states.. so yeah, i know some, I dunno some. If you're interested" in any, do drop me a mail. I'm all ears! pip@bmbc.info  That's about it. 1 hour of persistent Photshopping isn't really that fun. But its worth the effort. Till we meet again ;-)

      Phew, end of the week already. Lets recap.  Thursday afternoon was BM classes with Puan Suraya. Today we did some Fahaman, and believe me, its much tougher than O Levels. No doubt I got credit for O's, but if I were to take the test here, I would surely merely Pass. It is a great experience, I can testify. I met some Hotel and Tourism guys. They're all a fun bunch. Breaktime, we went down the cafeteria.. For once we all had lots to sembang about. Kenneth was a fun guy... with anti American setiments. His ambition is to be chef is large cruise ships. Also, he had experience working at Shangri-la. Ah well..  Friday telecom class. The supposed test didn't turn out to be true. But Jason promised this coming Friday we'll have a test. The new National Service girl came. Forgot her name... but she's the pleasant type. Nothing much happened except the usual tech / telecom discussions. We're into networking and networking fabrics now... (i.e. telephone wires, coaxial, and fiber) Its fun!  Saturday, today went for Micro-app. We did some MS Dos commands and played around abit. It was basic, thus deemed boring by someone as leet as myself. Everyone knew how DOS worked. As usual, the challenging part of this subject is to put our knowledge in words. Thankfully, I have Computer Studies experience. Woot!!  Later I'll be off to BM for the weekend. I received an SMS from Radiance that I might be needed as backup singer for the youth meeting tonight. Can't wait for that :P Then, Sunday we'll attend church, then go to granny's. We're gonna get the orchard cleared up abit. I might have to go college on Monday by bus. Take the 7:30 from BM to Komtar, then, hop onto another bus to Burma / Anson Road hopefully by 9:30am where KDU is located. It has been done before, and its quite an exciting thing... for one, I'm a public transport virgin and for another... its like.. "independence" ya know.. Now that mum and dad are staying together with me, I'm pretty much under scruntany.. not that it's a bad thing.. but I love freedom.  So as usual, I'll be afk (away from keyboard) till Monday afternoon after college. Happy weekend, everybody! And visit http://bmbc.info , ok? Sorry about piptech.org not working!

      Last Friday, Telecommunications class with Jason. We started the more technical parts of Telecom now.. with complex Physics terminologies and such. It was okay, just need some reading up. We're far behind the schedule, cuz usually when we discuss about something, other things pop up! Ev3r so often, we're distracted from the original thing. I think we were talking about Radio waves & Communications. Then, he said something about Astro. We all know that Astro is satellite, and that's another topic.  So, Jason actually worked for Astro for a period of time. He brought up the issue of hacked Astro cards and said that Astro actually knew those who are stealing their services. A mate of mine said that his whole neighbourhood are using hacked cards. I mean, pay a one time fee, and you're FREE from pesky subscription charges. It costs about Rm 130 a month for all packages here in Malaysia, so, in a year, its about Rm 1500 in fees. Then, he talked about spot beams... that Astro has a big "footprint", yes.. basically, if you're in China, India or Philippines, or even West Australia, you can get Astro reception. However, a concentrated "beam" is sent to an area (for example, Kampong Beribi in Brunei).. then, the computer calculates how many signals "reflect". Its sort of like a "ping" and then, they check with their subsciption records for people who paid. If they get more "pings", that means someone's not paying.  Actually, its kinda foolish for people not wanting to pay AT ALL. It'll be too obvious dammit! I wonder what guts it took you to go to the Astro office and say, "I don't want your service anymore". I mean, Astro is god. There's no other competition, and its programs are top dawg, other that the annoying local ads. If you don't pay a cent, you're telling them "I have a dish at home... er.. I ain't gonna use it". So, word of advice for hacked cards users "pay the cheapest subscription (and use your hacked card)". If you don't pay at all, they know something is going amiss.. If convincted, you'll be fined Rm 100,000 here in Malaysia and possible jail sentence; doesn't matter whether or not you produced the cards, as long as you're using it.  Btw, my Telecom lecturer happens to be an "ex" American grad phone phreaker, and hacker. He's Malaysian chinese but the accent, attitude and all is there =) Owns an audio shop, I believe, with RM60k turntables at his disposal and WiFi network at home :P Very fun guy. Today (thursday), there's gonna be a Engineering Society meeting with elections and all, basically an AGM. Hope I get selected.. thus improving my chances for a merit scholarship :P  Later that day, came back, rested. Arrived BM at 4pm, picked up a church friend, and set off for Sungai Petani. Its actually about 50 km away... but accessable via highway. In case you don't know.. the highways here have 110km/h speed limits, thus... its not "luar biasa" if you see cars zooming at 140-160km/h. Speed traps are set tho.. and you have the option to (a) bribe the cop (b) give lame excuse and escape altogether (c) pay the fine. Hahah..  Arrived at  urlLink Cinta Sayang Golf and Country Resort  by 6:30pm. Tonight tho, some church members hadn't arrived yet. That night, it was dinner by the golf driving range. FOUR!  Next morning, more friends came. Almost everybody was there. The Youth, little kids and adults were separated into their separate groups with Ps. Alex Chong ministering to the adults, Unc. Micheal and Aunt. Hannah with the Youth (fun guys) and their daughter Joanne playing with the kids. If you look through the  urlLink photos here , basically, it tells you the whole story lah.  Throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there was non stop, high octane action and amusement. Certainly there was time of worship and bible teaching, then the games, and the swimming in the evenings. The thing about camps is that, for the first days, you really think its tiring and a bore, and when its time to head home, you miss it. Luckily, I was well prepared (mentally)!! And.. actually loved the whole experience.  urlLink Aiyah.. just browse through the pictures lah! .  I made new friends, and grew closer to older ones. It was fun. The activities organised were well planned and all. uncle Shannon, an entertainer by profession showed kids, youth and adults alike some of his "geng" magic tricks. Phew.. such fast hands to deceive the eyes, and the mind.  Monday, packed, and went home with a teary eye. Not teary because of missing the camp, rather the thought of gaining knowledge of the one and only God almighty and the lessons learnt. Arrived home by evening and was too tired.. just slept till 9pm before going for dinner. Tuesday, still in BM, we did absolutely nothing. Mum had the clothes washed, dad did the gardening, I watched TV (no computer there!!). Evening visited granny tho, and the Siamese temple my dad grew up in. Too bad I was out of "ammo" to take pictures of the temple. Recently our Chief Minister  urlLink Tan Sri Koh Tsu Koon  visited the temple and He and His guys were tasting some "masakan kampung". They liked the Thai dish "kilek" so much that they promised to return for more soon! Apparently, the temple's chef's secret was excessive "santan".... That's what granny said. Granny could cook better "kilek"! She's got a tree in the orchard.  Oh, and its durian season again. Finally, after a year of fruitlessness, those thony fruits have finally sprouted. Its not fully riped, but when it is, it'll automatically drop down. Durian tree is a special tree which requires minimal attention yet producing rich, tasty fruits. There were about 40 trees brearing fruits... kinda cool to see all those durians on the trees. Maybe in a month or two, we should have some fruits ;-) I'll report to you the taste and all. There was also campedak fruit and other small ones. We left granny's at 7pm, and tapau some kampung eggs. Small and cute, but yummier than "normal" eggs. It is said kampung products are always better than the mainstream. Its true! I wonder what about kampung "chics" ;-) ;-) ;-)  Wednesday (yesterday).. at 9am, we went to the IC department to collect mum's MyKad. After 6 months+ of processing, its finally done. I took control of the car, while parents lined up. And a minute later, I was lucky enough to land in a parking slot. Whopee. Oh, earlier the previous night, I drove from the dinner place (Tenang restaurant) back home. Its about 1km+, but my driving was near flawless. So smooth, so lancar. I'm leet now. Afternoon, I rushed to this courier service to collect my mail. I won this voucher for Rm 100 in Thai food in KL. Gonna give it to my sis. Then, was slightly late for Maths class. There was a test today, so we were pretty spread out. It was all on Surds and Rational Numbers. I think I did okay, with 1 or 2 errors. But what the heck. Its 10% of the semester total, but yeah.. I did fine.  Thursday. My day started at 3am. Wanted to watch the Chelsea Champion's League match. Watched for a good 10 minutes then said to myself "Argh.. i'm no chelsea supporter! Everyone knows I love  urlLink Man United . What the heck? I went online instead and was surprised to find  urlLink San Fui  online. Talked to her abit. Apparently she was under exam stress. Sigh~ sometimes other people expect too much, and when numbers are programmed into your mind, your "panic quotient" just skyrockets. If you're kind hearted, ask her to calm down and think less about all the worries lah. Full time, Chelsea 2 - Monaco 2.. Monaco meets Porto in the Champion's League Final. Visit  urlLink Soccernet  for full report. Ah well, the team that narrowly beat Man United contraversially is now in the Finals. Nevermind. Its all right. Its 11am now, and I'll rest abit before going for BM classes this afternoon. After that, there's a 2 hour Eng. Society meeting, so look forward to that. I might report back tonight, if given the opportunity.  Thanks for visiting, and sorry for the server downtime.  urlLink Pinchpenny is cheap, but sucks . Oh, tell everyone you know about Piptech.org by adding this "signature" to your e-mail... or by word of mouth of MSN. Tell 'em "Visit piptech.org today!" =) I owe you one, dude and dudettes!

      I'm baaack! Phew, 5 days AFK (away from keyboard) is pain, but I survived it, at the same time, not think too much about the computer. I'm in college now, uploading the pictures to the camp. I was like the official photographer there ;P  Location: Cinta Sayang Golf & Country Resort, Sungai Petani Dates: 30th April - 3 May 2004  I had an exhillarating, extraordinary experience at this camp... the best I've ever been! All good things have got to come to an end, but I'm pretty happy overall.  BMBC Camp 2004 Pictures are available  urlLink HERE . I'm sorry they're not sorted properly, but in due time lah ;) Now I'm in college :P Just had a mini Maths test, I think I did okay, altho got wrong!  The full sized pics are available at RM 1 for a 4R print (buy 5 free 1) or RM 2 for 3 copies of 3R print. Sorry about the funny pricing stucture, but its still pending approval from church. Meanwhile, enjoy the online versions =)

      In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. That's where the phrase, "goodnight, sleep tight" came from.  The phrase "rule of thumb" is derived from an old English law which stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider than your thumb.  It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the "honey month" or what we know today as the "honeymoon."  In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King & the King gave them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K. (Fornication Under Consent of the King) on it. Now you know where that came from..

      This morning, I woke up early as usual (7am ish) and did the usuals (surf net, check mail, etc).. I'm trying to buy a  urlLink Palm Zire 21 . It costs about RM 400, so I'll have to save money from now on, if I were to buy now. It has the usual organiser functions, few games, etc. and I really need an organiser now. Paper and pen don't cut it anymore. And the wow factor is certainly there for me.. I'm looking forward to be a Palm owner! :P  Later, it'll be BM classes with Puan Suraya. She's nice, and smart. Also I get to meet new people from other "schools".. so that can't be boring. Its usually a fun activity filled session, 2-5pm. Then, later I'll go check into my sister's room. She'll be here till Sunday morning on official business. Look forward to meet her.  Other than that, the  urlLink BMBC youth blog  has 5 members now. I'm overly excited and hope the activity there won't be stagnent unlike  urlLink some   urlLink blogs ! Hehehe.. As for piptech.org, still no word from  urlLink the idiots . Sigh.. looks like its gonna be okay only in June. Sucks, I tell ya! Sucks.

       Scam alert! I got this in my e-mail and I feel suspecious!   From Marc Hunter   reply to: hunter/xxxx... (lotsa stuff) Subject: Could you please verify your e-mail address!  Hi there, You are receiving this message because automated spam detection software has flagged your recent email to me as suspicious, and it did not recognize your email address. If you simply reply to this message, your original message will go through and you will not be asked to do this again. Sorry for the incovenience, and thank you for your understanding. Rgds, Marc   I warn against replying. I have a sneaky feeling that if you DO reply, you'll be subjected to bombardment of pr0n advertisements and spam. I know of no "marc hunter" and certainly didn't e-mail him. I bet that he e-mailed everyone on Hotmail, and if you reply, you're telling him "Here I am... now, send me pr0n spam."  Oh, and the thing about pr0n e-mails.. they don't really give you the "good bit"... They'll tease you over, and ask you to pay for quality pron. That sucks. The world should be gree!  Good day, all.. I'm off to college soon and meet up with  urlLink Ruth

      Take note: The post below was typed in typical pip fashion. Beware.  Well, that Thai Prime Minister finally bought 30% stake in  Liverpool FC.  Obviously, there are lots of Liverpool fans in Thailand, mainly because of Owen and Gerrard. But hey, can't blame 'em... that's what Liverpool's all about! Now they have 60mil pounds from Thaksin's share purchase + a 30 mil kitty litter he promised. That's close to a cool 100 mil to spend in the seasons to come. Good for you, Ziq :-)   Mass mailing.  Hmm.. I like doing it. Many of us teens do... but the problem is, no one bothers do hide your receipient's identity! Its quite rude to display all those e-mail addresses naked like that. That's how pr0n advertisements get into your box, silly. So, next time you're forwarding something, in the To: field, type your own e-mail address, then, for your friend's e-mail addresses, hide it using the BCC (blind carbon copy) field. Simple? Practise it today! :-D  Do you think we are created with a random preset? We're talking  creation, and our origins  here... a bit to do with religion. Do you think God pre-programmed us with stuff, or is there really free will? My opinion: Certainly, we need some sort of instruction to start with. As we know, humankind's inputs are their eyes, ears, tongue, skin, and nose. But what initially  initiates  the senses? Our sixth's sense? Do you get what I mean?   We need our basic set of instructions. We need to be programmed to do what we do. A baby needs guidance from his or her parents... hence influence. Is our upbringing to blame, if we ever falter, and do the wrong things (aka sin)? Can we blame consequences? Why do people kill? Can the murderer go free, and blame it on his upbringing, which has NOTHING to do with the murder, but has a DIRECT IMPACT with his life? Did God program such thoughts (like murder, adultery etc) into man's knowledge?   Wait, what is the purpose of God creating us? He has his heavening beings singing praises to him all day long. Why create us? Where did the "dust" that God used to create man came from? Wait a sec, what ground? What happened 10 years before God started his 6 day creation? Drinking Heiniken and watching football? NO wait.. he existed before anything. There's no logic. No wait... is there a God?  All the evidence brought forward to me are unconvincing. If they were, there wouldn't be such doubts in minds of billions today. And all would agree on one single religion. Even Christianity has different diviations and cults.  Is hell big enough for all the unbelievers of Jesus Christ? Seriously, there should be close to tens of billions of people in hell today. Hey, if we actually made the wrong "choice".. our creator's gonna burn us in hell. Dude.. that's sad, innit? But don't worry. Look at the friends around you. They're all from different religions, I'm sure not all of them will make it to heaven anyway... so, at least you have company.  My theory is that when we die, we just die. Body rots, heart stops beating. End of story. We will be in a state of nothingness. No judgment, no suffering, no bullshit. My motto: Live life (on earth) to the fullest! yeah, baby!  Wait.. now its starting to become clear... There MUST be some sort of private competition between God and Satan. They must be in their heavenly thrones, playing a game of "Sims".   God: Haha.. I got 5 billion people believing in a God Satan:   You watch out.. My 1 billion consisting of atheists and people not being preached to are mine. They're owned. They're pawned! (thanks Fend for those terms).. God: Ah.. this game is getting boring. Satan: Yeah... lets start a "religion" game.. Since everyone is convinced that there's a God, why not see who they LOVE. God: Great idea. Satan: Alright.. [insert religionS here] belongs to me. God: Alrighty, I'll take Christianity, Buddhism and Islam. Satan: Deal. Lets see who will get the more "believers" God: Your tactics are pathetic. Satan: [middle finger salute] God: >:-P  Now, there are still people fighting for their faiths. All of them are political. If religion is proven to be a big joke, then the world will be in chaos. There will be no order and we'll be living in fear. There will be people killing people, all the bad things will just dominate the world. Hence, religion has been maintained so those bad things don't happen; and that we actually live in peace. Its like.. the good conscience winning the victory.  okay, that was totally random.  How do you differenciate between our good conscience, and the "voice of God"?? Everyone, since birth, has been implanted (like I say, pre-programmed) with a good and bad conscience. These conscience are attacked when religion comes into play. It seems to me, they are given new names, i.e. God and Satan. Funny how we interprete things. Who is to be believed? Who has the answer?  Look at non-Christians. There are the good guys and the bad guys. What makes them different from us, the believers of Jesus Christ? Are we that special? Let's not take any scripture quotes into the picture. Lets talk reasoning and human logic. Doesn't make sense, does it?  And the thing about faith. What the heck is it? Believing in something you cannot prove? What for?  Bottom line: Believe. Just believe.. :D and Christianity rawks! Christianity p4wNs all your other religion's asses! mwahhaa!! Oh, and we're gonna f*king die soon. An Asteriod, a few miles in diameter with an uncertain "course" is scheduled to make a near-Earth approach. If anything screws up (god forbid), it could mean the end of the world this September. "Are you ready? Let's try it!"

      Well, am in college now. I'm having a 10:15 - 11:15am break courtesy of the Semiconductor lecturer, Mr Babu. Apparently, some guys from Northumbria, UK are coming over to check the facilities and the programmes here. He's one of the main guys of this School of Engineering, so.. he has to be present. Btw, this semiconductor class is the most hardest subject this semester. Thankfully, the others are reasonably easy.  Driving today just improved. More lancar now. I'm hopeful that by this coming Saturday, I will be allowed to drive to Church for the youth meeting :P woot woot.  Tests are coming up. We're almost approaching the middle of the term. Wow, time flies.  I'm very happy because the blog at  urlLink BMBC Youth  is doing great. We have Jason, Daniel and Vivien on board now, so.. I'm anticipating an active blog like  urlLink these girls . Maybe by the end of the month, we should have about 10 bloggers. Wheeee!!!  In other news, I'll be going mountain climbing (more like a hill) with Aunt Lily tomorrow morning. Class tomorrow only begins at 2pm, so that's good. We'll wake up at 6:30 and be there by 7:30am. Its gonna be a good exercise as the last time I remebered exercising was....  Anyhow, life has been great as usual. College friends are great, and I've grown closer to a few. Basically, with that, I can get and offer help whenever necessary. Its good to build a network of study partners. Meanwhile, I need to work on my internet addiction. I think I spend close to 20 hours a week surfing the internet and on other net related activities (chat, surf, mail, blog, website management). Hope to cut that down before the exams.  Happy Birthday, Adele Poh!

      Am in college now. AS you know, my "hosting service" got screwed up. Basically their servers kept crashing and they lost all my data. Hence, my old efforts at piptech.org are all gone. Shit.  ANyhow, I've changed hosts, and piptech.org should be online in a week's time. Meanwhile, keep visiting piptech.blogspot.com =0 I'll be mass mailing everyone once the site is available again.  I managed to hack into my friend's e-mail account.  urlLink read about it here . Basically, this person's password was weak. Hence, I recommend everyone to use tougher pass.. :D use alpha-numeric combinations like ph1lip90210 or something.  Earlier, I drove 15 km to school for the 1st time. Wheee.. no scratches. Later I'll be driving home, and depending on dad's confidence.. I might be driving to school on my own tomorrow. I'm leet I tell ya! Leet!  Thanks for visiting my blog~!

      11pm, finally reached home. Checked my  urlLink Search for ET Intelligence (SETI)  and wow, I've completed close to 600 work units. One work unit takes about 3 hours to complete on my AMD Barton 2500+ processor.  Nothing much happened today. At church, Radiance broke the news that I was to worship lead this coming Sat at youth meet.. so gotta prepare for that. Otherwise, its the start of another hectic week for me. Let me run through what I go through in a typical week.  Morning session - 8:45am leave house, 9:30 college starts, 1pm college ends, 2pm reach home &  have lunch (hence, 8-2pm) Afternoon session - 1pm lunch & leave house, 2pm college starts, 5:30pm college ends, 6:30pm reach home after 1 hour in traffic jam (hence 1-7pm)   Monday - morning session - Computer Fundamentals.  Its like Computer Studies on steriods. All the thing I probably knew when I was 12~!  Tuesday - morning session - Semiconductors.  This is by far the most challenging subject in 1st semester. Its loads of Physics with a pinch of Chemistry. Very tough... but can cope kua..  Wednesday - afternoon session - Engineering Maths . For the 1st 3 semesters, its pretty much revising on O level Mathematics. But they're moving at such fast pace that you'll have to keep up, or lose the race. Nice teacher..  Thursday - afternoon session - BM . This is a wajib subject. I'm the only one in Engineering that has to do BM. Damn O Levels credit wasn't recognised, hence I need to attend this class. I see it as a blessing, cuz I get to improve my spoken Malay and make new friends at the same time. Very diversified bunch.. I love 'em... And the teacher's good too!  Friday - morning session - Telecommunications . The most understanding, fun and bouncy lecturer of all - Mr Jason. This subject is kinda fun to me.. and I like it. More so because this guy makes it more interesting.  Saturday - morning session - Microapplications  Translation: How to use the computer & its programs. Like Monday, this is the most basic subject and sorta boring. But its okay lah... I feel this 1337 aura =) attending these classes.  Then, right after Sat. classes, I rush home, have lunch... then family and I go to BM, about 25 km away from Penang island. We have a house there... dad usually goes for gardening, mum tags along. And at 7pm-ish.. I attend Youth Meeting. By far, they're the most lovable bunch lah... people I can directly relate to. College mates are great, but they come and go.  Sunday - Church worship. Then afternoon, more gardening (this time, I get involved). Perhaps some house-keeping and car washing (I do it!) and we head back to Penang to repeat the cycle.  I count myself blessed to have such an interesting routine. I thank the powers above for such great blessing bestowed on me. I love my life.

      Finally there is some life at piptech.org .. but guess what? They screwed up all my files! They're all gone! All my hard work in setting up piptech!! GONE!! f*king unreliable hosts.  I'm in BM now. I drove mum to The Summit, a shopping mall. Its Mother's Day.. and she's being pampered at the hair saloon. I'm now at the Cybercafe lah. Wow.. I drove from church, to makan place and back home.. These are not ordinary big wide streets. These are the streets of ancient Bukit Mertajam.. Where.. there are NO rules. I survived and am glad.  Parking at the basement was thrilling. COntrolling the clutch and brakes. Thank God I didn't make any scratch on dad's car. My driving is leet. Tomorrow (Monday).. I'll drive to college, with dad by my side. Will see how it goes! I'm overly excited! :P :P  Later, we'll be going home, and do some gardening. The orchard at Granny's is almost done... and maybe next weekend, we should be getting some durian now... This coming week, college will be exams on Friday and small quiz on Tuesday.  Oh, and church has some plans this weekend. Firstly, we're visiting the hospital and doing a dance to entertain the sick. Its all part of our church's community services. So.. its gonna be fun hangin' out with my buddies after Sunday service. As for Sat. youth meeting, I'll be worship leading. Phew! Yesterday, I was backup singer.. now I lead? Big step.. but I'm confident I can deliver! Heheh  Youth is a small group of 20ish. The pastor is Ps. Tamil.. he's the Charismatic type. A bit disturbing, but I'm starting to accept him now. We were all uncomfortable with his style of ministrying to us youths, but I guess we can all compromise. So, next week, worship lead (whooppee).. and that's about it.  Gday all. And thanks for staying faithful (despite piptech.org being down).

      What is it about wedding?  First, the Danish CROWN prince broke the law and married an Australian without the consent of the government (how sad).. Then, now the Spanish Prince wed. Both the brides are commoners.... how sweet.  Oh, and lets not forget the CROWN prince of Brunei wed a 17 year old school girl :) Future king and queen of Brunei... Argh.. all this pressure is killing me!! And my sister is getting married this December! I need to beat her! Anyone wanna marry me? Starting bid: RM 1... e-mail me!

      "You are a girl, who could pick any guy you want. Why Mr. Navorski"?  "This is something a man like you, can't understand!"  I've gotta watch "The Terminal".  In other news, I've been fiddling around with my new Zire 71. I've loaded close to 60 songs onto the 128MB SD card I bought, and it works like a charm.  I also bought 6 audio CDs.. D12, Eminem, Disney Classics 1&2, TVB Cantonese serial songs and William Hung - Inspiration. Will sucks. End of story.  Gday all!

      Wow.. I'm actually honoured to receive my first hate note. All my friends would laugh their asses off when they see this. I'm really actually a friendly guy. Anyhow, this guy think otherwise.  This guy, Zeroize is from Lowyat.net. He tried to buy one of the many things I offer for sale there. So, yes, he's right.. he tried to cut a deal with me and forced me to lower the price. Me being the seller had the final say, right? Well, he didn't really take critisism well.. Just like the guy on American Idol that Simon said "Sounded like a sick puppy dog"... Hahaha....  Vell, harsh words, by Zeroize's intepretation means "I'm not as nice as your girlfriend.. I can't kiss your ass as much as she does". My point being, basically, I can give you your HIGH EXPECTATIONS of what a Netizen should be. Simple. If you don't like what I say, stop talking to me. Instead, he replied "You are very rude".. Well, I must admit I'm sarcastic but, rude? hahahhaa.. U crack me up!  I don't know what it mean(s) to be polite? I am THE MOST polite person you'll probably encounter. Think I'm bragging? Head over to my  urlLink Forums  and post a poll on whether or not I'm rude. You're crazy, my friend. Crazy.  Certainly, I don't have the businessman quality. Me is Engineering student. Well, duh~  Well, if I don't have a businessman mentality, how am I to made so many deals go through at Lowyat.net? I have sold my P4 mobo and processor, bought a Palm Zire... Pen drive.. I've made close to 6-7 successful deals. So far, you are the worst "sad puppy dog" in the internet.  Nuff said. I don't feed the trolls.  ------  Now I'm at college, doing BM. We've got an assignment to do, it'll take up 10% of our final marks.. Ulasan on a story written by our Malay teaher 14 years ago. She's a great author, btw.. Noor Suraya.. Very understanding lady with great personality. Her knowledge knows no boundaries and her language is fluent as silk :) both in English and Malay. Well, to sum it up: she rawks.  My palm zire 71 is with me now, and its great as promised. I loaded the bible onto it.. and i have 2 versions. I could have up to 40+ versions in different languages, but what the heck for! I also am using the remote control function. Later I'll try other games and programs... Need time :)  Hi to K.Y (Khai Yuen)

      From  urlLink Slashdot.org   Iphtashu Fitz writes "Matthew Erhorn was filling his car with gasoline outside of New Paltz, NY when when he flipped open his cell phone to answer a call. The next thing he knew he was engulfed by a ball of fire. Luckily for Erhorn a quick thinking employee hit the emergency fire suppression system and he ended up with only minor burns. Firefighters investigating the accident  concluded that the cell phone triggered the fire. Experts at The Petroluum Equipment Institute disagree however, attributing the fire to static electricity. Since 1992 the PEI has documented 158 cases of gas pump fires believed to have been started by static electricity. Apparently cell phone signals are too weak to ignite gasoline vapors, but the human body can generate enough static electiricy (60,000 volts) from simply sliding out of your car seat to do just that. Do you pay attention to all those signs at the gas pump telling you to to make sure your car, cell phone, PDA, pacemaker, etc. are all turned off before you start pumping?  =====  Oh, and today is my library book due date. I had it renewed last week, but never touched it ever since. Its all about fiber optic networks and the players of this game. Anyone for OC-768? (640Gb/s that's 640 billion bit per second) over ATM (Asynchonous Transfer Mode)...  BM classes today, gonna have a fun time with buddies from H&T. And my palm WILL come today.. I'll take some pics when have opportunity lah. Thanks for visiting ;)

       Euro English  credits to  urlLink Sharon Cheong from Brunei .  Gawd.. I hope dis doesn't happen!! i know it won't :)  The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the European Union rather than German, which was the other possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5-year phase-in plan that would become known as "Euro-English".   In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will make sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of "k". This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.   There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like fotograf 20 percent shorter. (sidenote: wheee! for filip)   In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent "e" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.   By the fourth yer peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing"th" with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz yer, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou" and after ziz fifz yer, ve vil hav a reil sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor trubl  or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi tu understand ech oza.   Ze drem of a united urop vil finali kum tru. If zis mad you smil, pleas pas on to oza pepl. Zen ve vil rul ze vorld!!!  ========  My palm zire is coming soon. I wonder how many posts have i rant about this baby reaching my hands! It should arrive by noon or maybe afternoon since its all the way from Kuching. Yeah, I guess I'll have it by evening. Rest assured, I'll drive 100km/h from college just to reach home asap. College today is from 2-5pm doing Engineering Maths. I might SMS to update the blog from college.. so watch this space..  Another gentle reminder to visit  urlLink  Pipboard

      I'll sign off today's ACTIVE day with an e-mail forward. I think i set a record today with 5-6 posts! Phew... I love updating my blog :P I'm a blog whore! Gnite everyone!  =======  Don't Mess with the IT Guys. This is an actual letter of resignation from an employee at "Zantex Computers", Australia, to his boss, J.Pilgrim. His boss, known as "Pilly," apparently resigned very soon afterwards!  Dear Mr. Pilgrim,  As an employee of an institution of higher education, I have a few very basic expectations. Chief among these is that my direct superiors have an intellect that ranges above the common ground squirrel. After your consistent and annoying harassment of my co-workers and myself, during the commission of our duties, I can only surmise that you are one of the few true genetic wastes of our time.  Asking me, a network administrator, to explain every little nuance of everything I do each time you happen to stroll into my office is not only a waste of time, but also a waste of precious oxygen. I was hired, because I know how to network computer systems and you were apparently hired to provide amusement to myself and other employees, who watch you vainly attempt to understand the concept of "cut and paste" - for the hundredth time.  You will never understand computers. Something as incredibly simple as binary still gives you too many options. You will also never understand why people hate you, but I am going to try and explain it to you, even though I am sure this will be just as effective as telling you what an IP is. Your shiny new iMac has more personality than you ever will. You walk around the building all day, shiftless looking for fault in others. You have a sharp dressed, useless look about you that may have worked for your interview, but now that you actually have responsibility, you pawn it off on overworked staff, hoping their talent will cover for your glaring ineptitude.  In a world of managerial evolution, you are the blue-green algae that everyone else eats and laughs at. Managers like you are a sad proof of the Dilbert principle. Seeing as this situation is unlikely to change without you getting a full frontal lobotomy reversal, I am forced to tender my resignation; however I have a few parting thoughts.  1. When someone calls you in reference to employment, it is illegal to give me a bad recommendation. The most you can say to hurt me is:  "I prefer not to comment." I will have friends randomly call you over the next couple of years, to keep you honest, because I know you would be unable to do it on your own.  2. I have all the passwords to every account on the system, and I know every password you have used for the last five years. If you decide to get cute, I am going to publish your "favorites list", which I conveniently saved when you made me "back up" your useless files. I do believe that terms like "Lolita" are not usually viewed favorably by the administration.  3. When you borrowed the digital camera to "take pictures of your mothers birthday", you neglected to mention that you were going to take pictures of yourself in the mirror n*de. Then you forgot to erase them like the techno-moron you really are. Suffice it to say I have never seen such odd acts with a ketchup bottle, but I assure you that those have been copied and kept in safe places pending the authoring of a glowing letter of recommendation. (Try to use a spell checker please.I hate having to correct your mistakes.)  Thank you for your time, and I expect the letter of recommendation on my desk by 8:00 am tomorrow. One word of this to anybody, and all of your little twisted repugnant obsessions will be open to the public.  Never f*** with your systems administrator. Why? Because they know what you do with all that free time!  Sincerely, Adrian

I'm expecting my Palm Zire 71 shipment by tomorrow afternoon, wish me luck. I paid RM 620 for this baby... while a new unit costs RM 950 (official), RM 750 retail stores.... so, $620 is not really a bargain, but can do lah :)

       Lizard's love   This is a true story that happened in Japan.  In order to renovate the house, someone in Japan tears open the wall. Japanese houses normally have a hollow space between the wooden walls. When tearing down the walls, he found that there was a lizard stuck there because a nail from outside hammered into one of its feet. He sees this, feels pity, and at the same time curious, as when he checked the nail, it was nailed 10 years ago when the house was first built.  What happened?  The lizard has survived in such position for 10 years! In a dark wall partition for 10 years without moving, it is impossible and mind boggling. Then he wondered how this lizard survived for 10 years without moving a single step--since its foot was nailed!  So he stopped his work and observed the lizard, what it has been doing, and what and how it has been eating. Later, not knowing from where it came, appears another lizard, with food in its mouth.  Ahh! He was stunned and touched deeply. For the lizard that was stuck by nail, another lizard has been feeding it for the past 10 years... Such love, such a beautiful love! Such love happened even with this tiny creature ... What can love do? It can do wonders! Love can do miracles! Imagine? it has been doing that untiringly for 10 long years, without giving up hope on its partner.  Imagine what a small creature can do that a creature blessed with a brilliant mind can't. I was touched when I heard this story and started wondering about relationships between family members, friends, lovers, brothers, sisters. As information and communication technology advances, our access to information becomes faster and faster. But the distance between human beings is it getting closer as well?  I ask you...please never abandon your loved ones.   She Bangs - made famous by our william hung   Talk to me Tell me your name You blow me off like it's all the same You lit a fuse and now I'm ticking away Like a bomb Yeah, Baby Talk to me Tell me your sign You're switching sides like a Gemini You're playing games and now you're hittin' my heart Like a drum Yeah, Baby Well if Lady Luck gets on my side We're gonna rock this town alive I'll let her rough me up Till she knocks me out She walks like she talks, And she talks like she walks And she bangs, she bangs Oh baby When she moves, she moves I go crazy 'Cause she looks like a flower but she stings like a bee Like every girl in history She bangs, she bangs I'm wasted by the way she moves No one ever looked so fine She reminds me that a woman only got one thing on her mind Talk to me Tell me your name I'm just a link in your daisy chain Your rap sounds like a diamond Map to the stars Yeah, Baby Talk to me Tell me the news You wear me out like a pair of shoes We'll dance until the band goes home Then you're gone Yeah, Baby Well if it looks like love should be a crime You'd better lock me up for life I'll do the time with a smile on my face Thinking of her in her leather and lace Well if Lady Luck gets on my side We're gonna rock this town alive I'll let her rough me up Till she knocks me out She walks like she talks, And she talks like she walks  =========  That's about it. Very bored at home, guess I'll be doing the unimaginable! I'll be revising abit!! wooot!

      My semiconductor lecturer Mr Babu is hospitalised. Dunno what happened, but I was told by  Mr Jason that there's no class today. Oh well, who would complain when given an extra day of rest.  The mp3 link is now  urlLink piptech.org/mini . =) Opens up an Angelfire site.. Since its free, heck why not?  going to the Tenaga National today to do some business. Then, going to the Bank to withdraw some cash to repay dad for using his online banking for the Palm payment. Whee.. Palm Zire 71 is mine! Its quite a good device, altho not the latest... :D Check it out at  urlLink Palm One .  Remember to visit  urlLink Pipboard  okay?

      Phew.. I made it to college without a scratch. The parking system is abit pathetic.. I've gotta incert coins less than 50 sen in denomination to pay for the RM 2 parking. IT was a PAIN inserting so many coins.... and my hands are short!! I reached class at 9:40am & was 10 minutes late, but no worries.. no one's punctual!  I've uploaded some MP3s using my college line for all to enjoy!  urlLink Not your Average Thug 3,924 KB   urlLink Linkin Park - Session 3,389 KB   urlLink Eminem - The Kids 4,768 KB   urlLink Dang Ni (Chinese) 3,178 KB   urlLink Hillsongs Australia - Touching Heaven Changing Earth 3,617 KB   Now having a break from Computer Fundamentals, and yes.. its really Fundamental! We're learning flowcharts now. Basically, its Computer Studies.. and I have 5 years experience already. All my classmates are Computer virgins.. so.. I've just gotta shut up and prove myself in the tests.  Life rawks - cuz I'm finally driving. Yeah, and I SMSed a few guys at 2:30am just asking them to visit piptech! I finally slept at 3:15am.. and I'm still quite awake as of now!

      Yupp.. today's the moment of truth. I'll be driving 15km ALONE to college. Phew. The past week, I had dad by my side, but now, I'll be going solo.  In other news, I sorta screwed up on my  urlLink Lowyat.net  bid handling. I bid $660 for an item, and now I'm only willing to pay $600. I feel so bad. But that's what I can afford. A new unit of the product will cost $770 with free 64 MB card, so I thought $600 was fair. Its all up to the seller now.. it looks bleak. If it fail, then I have to resort to a more powerful, more "latest" model, costing $600.. this one doesn't have digital camera.. that's the only downside.  Thanks for visiting, all!

      Well... a surprising news. A 30 year old soon-to-be KING marrying a 17 year old girl that  urlLink my friend, Fui  used to play "Barbie Doll" with. Wow.. =) I'm shocked.    Congratulations to Prince Billah & Dk. Sarah binte Pengiran Haji Salleh Abdul Rahman. They're next in line to the throne.   urlLink from Brudirect.com   In other news, worship leading during youth meeting went well. We had a short 15 minute discussion about Conflicts. I'll type out the text when I have time. Very interesting. Anyhow, you can always search Google on conflicts.. :) Its good to know these sort of things.  The English premier league is over, and Ronaldo and Fletcher will be missing the final due to the red cards receieved during the last game of the season. That sucks. But I'm sure we can beat Milwall this coming Saturday, 9pm on Astro Supersports ;)  Sunday came and went. Nothing unusual.. We went to granny's orchard. We ate some durians and now I'm home. I think there's a test this week, now.. which subject it is..

      God sure knows how to teach His children.  Just now, at class around 11am, the Microapp teacher was teaching us to use Excel.. and asked us to draw a plan (diagram) using Excel. It was as fun as eating sand! Well, after finishing, she inspected my work, and concluded that it wasn't complete.  With a sour face, and an inflated ego, I gave her the middle finger salute. Had a giggle with my friends, and yes... that WAS satisfying.  Driving home, near the "underpass"... I wanted to go to the left lane in order to reach home. After signalling for 10 secs, still they don't give way. Suddenly, I look in front and I was so close to the Merz's bumper.. I swirved left, and nearly hit this motor cyclist. Asshole gave me the salute!  Haha.. isn't it amazing how God works?  Oh, I won't be going to Youth Meet today. Dad and mum have Malay wedding reception to attend. Oh well, guess I'll continue my Shrek 2 in CANTONESE, Confessions of hot chic and of course, Troy.. VCD galore.. and of course, study for my Semiconductor exams!

      Today after college, at 3pm ish.. I drove dad and mum to BM. This is the first time me driving across the famous Penang bridge. I nearly met an accident as there was a sudden "brake" near the Toll Plaza.. emergency braked.. luckily the air bags didn't pop up, or I get killed by the air bags!! lol..  it was frightening (for dad and mum).. I was reasonably cool and calm, altho abit shaken lah.. Overall, it thought me the "peraturan dua saat" I learnt once upon a time. Other than that, the whole journey to BM went smooth, I'm now l33t.  Talking about l33t.... Liang, Neil (collegemates) and I were on MSN talking l33t. Leet talk (or elite talk) is a language commonly used by hackers so that their messages cannot be intercepted or searched using a search engine. If I were to tell you "i'll be breaking into microsoft june 1st".. then, the FBI or whatever can Google these terms and find my website (gosh, no.. I don't have the experties to hack MS).  So, h4ck3r$ t4lK 1!k3 tH1$... and u$3 t3Rm$ l!k3 ph34r, l33t, p4wned (search around the web, there should be a leet dictionary somewhere). Its a fun language to learn and use while MSNing.. Rather than lousy SMS lingo.  Hi to cousin Li Tinh, Ruth, Jen, Radiance and all da nice people who managed to drop by piptech.org (through the bulletin board). Sorry for inconvenicen.. Just wanting them to post something in the Forums b4 arriving here.  =0  Neway, congrats to Vivi for getting Biochem, Danny for getting Dentistry (hey, its a blessing too.. u may earn your million in 5-10 years.. if u work hard!) also to Andreen (Chinese lit, whoa.. respect dude.. everytime I *try* to speak Manglish, u sure / can laugh at me... cuz I speak like ang-mo!) and to Jon.. whatever course u might be taking.. all da best!  =)  Dad and I watched the American Idol replay, the Finals on 8TV.... first song for Diana deGemuk was great, 2nd one abit lousy and 3rd one was a disaster. She was intimidated by Fantasia's wonderful performance.... Fantasia didn't start well, but her 2nd and 3rd song was out of this world. I'll buy her album when it comes ;) Remember Ruben Studdord, Clay Aiken and that Guy Sebastian (yea, Rach, I know u like him).  Listening to Bone Thugs, and D12. Gnite all, college at 9am tomorrow, hence 8am have to leave home, hence 7am have to wake up. And as usual, I'll be mia, afk (missing in action, away from keyboard) for the whole of Saturday and Sunday in Bukit Mertajam. ;-) Thanks for visiting!

      Well, yesterday was eventful. After the usual 2-5:30 pm date with Ms Voon, the Engineering Maths teacher, I headed for Komtar.. it was abit of a crawl.. but eventually, I found the BSN (bank simpanan).. the place where the badminton was on.  It was only about 6pm, so I went to Komtar there and Cybercafe-d.. Wasted RM 3 for an hour's of access, but what the heck :P At around 6:45pm, went for makan. I had yin yong.. which was excellent - at New Lane area.... 7:10pm, met the gang. And I was surprised!  Apparently, almost all of them are from Engineering. KDU Penang has 6-7 schools, but School of Engineering was the dominant one.. A few ppl I know, they're my senior. It was fun stuff, really.. cuz all of them played very well.. Even the girls were skilled. I had loads of fun, and oh.. I beat them all :P [brags]  Next Wed / Thu, I'll probably have supper with them. They usually have a gathering after the 9pm game... so that's kinda fun. Today, I'll skip badminton, my arms hurt badly... Its been 1/2 a year since I last played, see? But I was still reasonably at the top of my form. Wheee =)  Later that night, wrote some testimonials on Friendster and had fun ;) Nothing much happened, and I slept a bit late lah... 2:45am, my alarm woke me up. I woke up, shut it off.. and went back to bed. FC Porto and Monaco don't excite me. Probably the worst finals in Champions' League History! Ultimately, the class of Porto showed, and they won 3-0. Good for them... screw their coach! (who is apparently going to Chelsea next season).  Woke up as usual this morning... abit late, preparing my assignment (as below).. then 9:25am, went to the school computer lab to have it printed... Still got 50 pages in my Printing quota :-D must use puas puas! I'm staying back today for BM classes later with Puan Suraya... The cool teacha.. =) Gonna meet my buddies from H&T.. and have loadsa fun learning about the history of the Malay language, and how to improve my language in general.  5:30pm, shud reach home. Plan to sleep well, and rest my right arm... Still kinda hurts, and probably will read up my Semiconductor and Telecommunications and do some Maths. My Maths sucked. Only 8 marks out of 15.. and its all on Surds and rational numbers nia.. me so disgraceful. I can justify that my buddies also got around that region, highest being 8.75 marks nia.. but hey, gotta do better!!!  Man U has signed Alan Smith for 7 mil pounds. Well, he's a good buy, except his temper. He's known to get angered very easy. Surely will get lotsa red card wan, and tunnel burst up with his own team mate or manager. He's a tough guy, so.. hope he can score and provide for Man United in 90 days time. Till then, its boredom 100%!!! No footie, only Euro 2004.... But that's equally good too.  Next weekend, Olivia & Anthony are coming to Penang for a wedding, and on Sunday, dad and mum are going to KL for a wedding... So, they carpool and dad and mum take bus back to Penang lah. I'll be driving them, so that's l33t.  I've been starving myself the past few days.. eating less and all. Hopefully, my waist can reduce sikit to less then 36' lah... (now its around 37') and my weight, target: 160 pounds, 70kg... (now at 165 pounds oredi). I've been badmintoning abit, so my leg muscles are leet now... So firm. =) Sigh, how I wish my whole body was as mascular!  Do post in the  urlLink Forums / Community Discussion Boards . Start a topic, reply to a post.. just say anything that's on your mind. ALL ARE INVITED and your post will make me smile ;-)   Thank you.

How smart ;) Its actually due tomorrow, but today, I'm pretty bz  9-1 Telecom replacement class.... 2-5 usual BM class 6-9 badminton, 9-10, supper with badminton gang.  Tomorrow 9am assignment due.   Sucky Porto won the Champions' League final. Their coach is going to Chelsea next season.. interesting...   urlLink jason.zip

      Okay, here's the deal. I'm now in BM Summit Cybercafe.. I paid RM 1.50 for 1/2 hours internet... my mum is doing her hair here, somewhere. And I really feel the urge to update!  Lets talk about:   MSN Nicknames  Not exactly a nick but more like a way to express oneself! Gone were the days where you would type "pip" or "alan" or "mariah".. nowadays, "nicknames" not only come in phrases but in long sentences professing their love for another, advertising websites or just plain funny.  As of 8:53pm, I have....  (8)Rutheeeeeeee >:) now that is cute! How about Pipppeeeeeeeeeeeee... :)  J?z http://uniqueunity.reality-bytes.org  =) ahh... advertisement of their blogs.. just like me!  ad infinitum... if i'm statusless and i don't reply u, its either i'm dead or ignoring you.  Boy, she does make her feelings known to the world!  Boo.. getting sick Sucks Well, duh~!.. I think the "sick" means lovesick.. I dunno.

      Wow.. its been 48+ hours since I last updated.  Just came back from badminton, dad rejected my request for RM 1500 to get a 2nd hand laptop which was an absolute steal  Lemme give ya the specs:  p3 / 600 Mhz speed step upgraded 256 Mb ram upgraded 40 gig hard disk 12" screen tip top condition  RM 1500.  I cannot believe it.. Its still sinking in that my dad rejected such humble request... reasoning that I've been "spending too much"! Its a fking joke. But i accept it, for he knows what's best for me. Mana tau, later when I really need laptop, he'll Shell out RM 5000 for a top of the line FULLY decked out Centrino 15 incher? Who knows?  I'm off to console myself.

      If one or two people hate him, then, its prejudice.. Its unfair judgement.. Its a personal "beef". But if 20 or nearly ALL / EVERYONE hates him.. there HAS to be SOMETHING wrong.  Look at the Uncle at Sunday Service last week. Everyone says He's wrong and he still think he's right. Something's wrong, right? HEhehe...  Ps. Tamil's approach is kinda "new age"... No one really accepts this sort of teaching. I'm sure our parent's intentions for us to go to Youth Meet is to hang out with friends and to learn good values.. Now this dude is preaching about weird weird stuff in weird weird WAYS. He critisizes like we're his own children and leave the helpless worship leaders (*during his visit) look like idiots.  Two words: He sucks.  I hope the church can forgive the youth for "halau"-ing the pastor... But he's a bad pick. WE need someone who can relate to us, who is understanding and knows that we're not perfect.  College exam just now, Semiconductors. The saying goes "It was a piece of cake"... I'll modify it to reflect how it was, for me...  "It was a piece of 2 hour cake MUNCHED by me in 45 minutes."  Make sense to you?  Me neither  :P

      His name was Fleming, and he was a poor Scottish farmer. One day, while trying to make a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby bog. He dropped his tools and ran to the bog There, mired to his waist in black muck, was a terrified boy, screaming and struggling to free himself. Farmer Fleming saved the lad from what could have been a slow and terrifying death.  The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman's sparse surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved.  "I want to repay you," said the nobleman "You saved my son's life."  "No, I can't accept payment for what I did," the Scottish farmer replied waving off the offer. At that moment, the farmer's own son came to the door of the family hovel.  "Is that your son?" the nobleman asked.  "Yes," the farmer replied proudly.  "I'll make you a deal. Let me provide him with the level of education my own son will enjoy. If the lad is anything like his father, he'll no doubt grow to be a man we both will be proud of." And that he did. Farmer Fleming's son attended the very best schools and in time, graduated from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, and went on to become known throughout the world as the noted Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of Penicillin.  Years afterward, the same nobleman's son who was saved from the bog was stricken with pneumonia.  What saved his life this time? Penicillin. The name of the nobleman? Lord Randolph Churchill. His son's name? Sir Winston Churchill.  Someone once said: What goes around comes around. Work like you don't need the money.  Love like you've never been hurt.  Dance like nobody's watching. Sing like nobody's listening. Live like it's Heaven on Earth.  It's National Friendship Week. Send this to everyone you consider A FRIEND. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. AN IRISH FRIENDSHIP WISH: You had better send this back!! Good Luck! I hope it works...  May there always be work for your hands to do; May your purse always hold a coin or two; May the sun always shine on your windowpane; May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain; May the hand of a friend always be near you; May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.  ====  What a load of crab! But I don't mind the encouraging words :P

      Isn't it funny - how teens nowadays can afford $1500 for flashy handphones but struggle to get $50 for airtime credit? I mean, we can afford to change phones on an annual basis (not that the phone is faulty, but just cuz "its the latest!") Seriously, one should question the source of one's income to afford such luxuries!  I stuck with my 3315 till my sis left for the States (she got a diff phone there, diff networks) and hence I'm now left with a 7250 (half-broken, 99% functional). Its funny how teens change phones like they change their jeans!  I'm at college now, Malay test just now was okay. I guess I did decent.. :P altho no where near B+ performance.

      Just arrived home at Penang. Dad collected about 15 durians from grannys.. And believe me, they're absolutely fab!  I'm actually tasting the labours of my grandad (deceased).. he took the seeds that was recommended by his buddies, and planted it at his estate. 15 years down the line, his grandchildrens are reaping its rewards.. Ah.. how emotional.  Off to take my maths test soon! And.. later tonite, badminton as usual!

      Today, I got ffk-ed by the cops. I parked too near to the junction... just for the sake of saving $2 and having to walk far. Perhaps it was because I was abit late, reaching college at 9am, when the bus actually took off 15 minutes past. Well, I've learnt my lesson... next time, if wanna illegal park, make sure its abit further away from junction and not "obstructing traffic".    My first ticket  Neil didn't come today, dunno why. Perhaps it was the exhausting England vs Switzerland match, which btw, England won 3-0 (Rooney 2x, Gerrard). France only drew 2-2.  Here are some pics of the factory visit. We went to Globetronix, a medium (relative) sized company making semiconductors. Everyone claims to have links with the big names (Intel, Moto, SonyEricsson, Samsung).... I guess they really are quite a big company. The building is big, with quite a lot of engineers. I got to see the engineers at work, doing various processes throughout the assembly line. Its tough, and somewhat boring. I don't know what caused me to choose this field... but what is chosen is chosen. Stick with it.... :P    Puan Suraya - same name as my BM teacher.. She's our Globetronics tourguide    Chun Hoong, exiting the factory    Kuan Loon, in college, waiting for the bus    The group at the conference hall. Liang is right, front sitting    40 Engineering students from various semesters    Hakim =) left of Yellow shirt dude..    More...    The Administrator guy at School of Engineering. Also my Telecom lecturer. Jason. Fun dude.   Tomorrow, dad's friend is coming over for the weekend. I'll be sleeping in the tv area :P, but for one night, that's okay! Will be watching the TV all nite long. Unfortunately, this means I'll miss youth meeting and the special Parents Day Sunday at church. Sigh~  Exams are 3-4 weeks time, so I gotta be revising. Wish me well!!

      Whee.. I got my 1st traffic offence. Kudos to myself. I think its gonna cost me RM 100... but I've saved Rm 100 from parking fees so far, so I guess the law of probablility finally caught up with me. I was unlucky.. But what is done is done.. Dad will fix it for me soon (thx, dad!)  Oh, and we had a factory visit today. Now I realise that being engineer is not about big $.. more like donkey jobs working with dumb machines :(

      Sigh~ Late late goals from France drubbed England aside in the 2-1 game that broke the hearts of the Lions. In case you haven't read about it (I highly doubt), here are the highlights.  * 38th minute SUPERB header by Lampard from a David Beckham freekick. Eng 1 - Fra 0 * 60 something minute. Silvestre brings down Rooney. Beckham steps up, Barthez (Fra) saves. Should have been 2-0, but score stays 1-0 * 90th minute -  Free kick to France. Zidane steps up... the defencive "wall" did its best. James was stoned. 1-1 Ole Zizou! * 93rd minute - Unfortunate error by Gerrard... backpassed to goallie, without seeing Henry behind him. Henry intercepted, and brought down by James. Penalty for France. Zizou stepped up. *thud*......... GOAL! England 1 - France 2.  Brooklyn / Romeo Beckham cried.... so did many of the England supporters around the world, in their hearts. These kinda things make you wanna kill yourself. But ah well, that's football.  Last weekend was uneventful... The church youth wanted to do a skit and a couple of dances. The practises over Saturday and Sunday were pathetic, to say the least. Heh... lack of organisation and discipline. See if we can bring it up this Saturday nite (hope so...) Parents Day will be this Sunday, at church.  This morning, the KDU IT Fair kicked off. We've got industry players visiting our college (the likes of Oracle and various Penang IT companies). They've got customers such as Dell Taiwan, China and everywhere. The semiconductor lecture today lasted from 9:30-10:30am only, then, we went to the Lecture Hall to listen to this guy, an ex-KDU student.... It was an interesting keynote, with a heck of a lot of videos to show us how the industry works in general. We saw Supercomputers (Apple VA tech with 1100 Computers at 2200 processors with 10Gbit communication fabric from Infiniband), how Microsoft works (how bugs are detected and swashed), how his company worked... very cool robotics and manufacturing systems. Just wonderful.  I felt abit sleepy tho :P  Tonight I'll be watching the Netherlands play Germany. Wanna see Ruud the man scoring. Sad to see that Scholes and Butt and Gary received knocks in Euro 2004 so soon into it... I think Butt ain't gonna recover in time :( and Scholes' role in left midfield ain't as effective as behind the strikers. Oh well.. Sven, you gotta choose!  Last few days, the guys at college have been going crazy over the Eamon - Don't Want you Back song. It kinda reminds oneself of the harsh reality... most of the times in a relationship, its the girl who initiates the break up.. Ultimately, she gets to brag "I just dumped this so & so.. Now, this guy is singing to the girl, hence ... creating the "I fire the boss scenario" instead of the boss firing you!   Tomorrow, Maths class is in the afternoon, so that's good (can wake up uber late). Go Holland! Oh, and thanks to an online friend (who apparently studies in the same college and share the same interest and knows the same bunch of guys I interact with)... She got me this self-cut CD which includes:  United Live: More than Life, To The Ends of the Earth, King of Majesty, My Best Friend  Planet Shakers: Rain down, My king, Open up the Gates, Reflector, Phenomena  Altered Frequency.  1337 |-|4x0r  I always had something in mind, and when wanting to write it to the blog, it sorta disappears. Which reminds me of the guy who came to talk today, saying that "If you have a great idea, immediately stop whatever you're doing (including pang sai). Write it down on a piece of paper (in my case, the Palm handheld :P ) and continue what you're doing". Great ideas come and go very quickly.  Wishing you all the best!

       TWO TOUGH QUESTIONS  thanks to  urlLink San Fui   Question 1:    If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already, three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?    Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.    Question 2:  It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.    Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.  Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.  Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.    Which of these candidates would be your choice?              Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Candidate B is Winston Churchill.  Candidate C is Adolph Hitler.    And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven.    Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone. Never be afraid to try something new. Remember: Amateurs built the ark. Professionals built the Titanic.    Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500 employees and has the following statistics:   29 have been accused of spousal abuse  7 have been arrested for fraud  19 have been accused of writing bad checks  117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses  3 have done time for assault  71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit  14 have been arrested on drug-related charges  8 have been arrested for shoplifting  21 are currently defendants in lawsuits  84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year    Can you guess which organization this is? Give up yet?    It's the 535 members of the United States Congress.   The same group of idiots that crank out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest of us in line. You gotta pass this one on.  --

      Read this. It's quite good. Things that really annoy you!!!!  People who point at their wrist while asking for the time....I know where my watch is pal, where the f**k is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is?  People who are willing to get off their arse to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.  When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too". Too F**king right I do! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?  When people say "it's always the last place you look". Of course it is. Why the f**k would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?  When people say while watching a film "did you see that?". No tosser, I paid £4.50 to come to the cinema and stare at the f**king floor.  People who ask "Can I ask you a question?"...... Didn't really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?  When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.  When people say "life is short". What the f**k?? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever f**king does!! What can you do that's longer?  When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks "Has the bus come yet?".If the bus came would I be standing here, Kn*bhead?  People who say things like 'My eyes aren't what they used to be'. So what did they used to be? Ears?, Wellington boots?  When your eating something and someone asks 'Is that nice?' No it's really revolting, I always eat stuff I hate!  People who announce they are going to the toilet. Thanks! that's an image I really didn't need.  McDonalds staff who pretend they don't understand you unless you insert the'Mc' before the item you are ordering.....It has to be a 'McChicken Burger', just a 'Chicken Burger' gets a blank look...........Well I'll have a McStraw and jam it in your McEyes you McF*ckin McTos*er!

      Well, dad and mum headed off to BM this afternoon while I was napping. They're going to attend a funeral. Its the 3rd funeral within the week. All of a sudden, everybody's dying. Which prompts me to think about life. What happens after we die? But before that, I think I should live life to the fullest, and enjoy every moment of it.  Sorry to  urlLink Juan  for mistakenly wishing her her 17th birthday when in actual fact, she just turned 16. How embarrasing; but that's what you get for not knowing your friends that well.   Sunday church service was interesting, with the youth doing their presentation.  urlLink Click here for a full report . I backed out at the last minute, reasoning that I don't wanna ruin the show because of my no-show for the crucial practise the night before. Sorry I disappointed a few, but.. :P I'll try to make it up, next time.  England will meet Croatia tonight. Supposely they're the weakest team around, but somehow managed to savage draws in both their games. It'll be interesting where Paul Scholes will play. He has proven to be ineffective in left midfield. Gosh, I hope Erikson make some changes...  My ideal lineup will be  4-3-1-2 formation (or 4-3-3 hybrid)  ------rooney------owen------- ----------scholes------------ ---gerrard--lampard--becks--- -cole-terry--campbell--gary-- -----------james-------------  See wot happens tonite. I hope to get some revision done, cuz exams will be a week before 24th July... I think starting on the 18th. Also, I have Malay orals this Thursday.. gotta put up a good show in front of the class.. carries a mere 10 marks, but its the "overall satisfaction" of pleasing the class that excites me. =)  Thanks for visiting!

      Malaysians are getting married at older age. Why? Let me give an example.It is a little bit long example. If you wantto skip it, there is a summary at the end.  Say you are a fresh graduate at that age of 23, a male, starting a carrier as an executive officer working somewhere in KL with a salary, say RM2000 per month and without any saving in the bank.  Monthly, extracting your expenditures on foods, transportation (public or motorcycle), electricity, water, phone, house rent and other expenses, say youcan save about RM800 the most. Then, because you are a good son, you send some money to your parents or relatives about RM300 per month. This will give you a balance of RM500 of saving. For the first year, maybe you are very discipline with your budget, so you save about RM5000.  The next year at the age of 24, you meet a girl of your dream. Both of you plan to get married after one year or two. Ok, that's fine, it gives you time to save some more money and some more timeto prepare the basic necessities for a 'happy' family?a car and a roof to live under. That year because you are a hard worker, you get a raise of 10%. Since you are also agentleman, you make sure some money is put asideto spend on dates and gifts for your girl, so 10% goes for her. Like the previous year, after much sweat and meggie-eating months, you save another RM5000. Your company is doing ok. You are paid 2 months bonus. So, another RM4000 is added to your saving. So, your total saving now is RM14,000. You decide to spend about RM8000 on a brand-new RM40,000 car downpayment. So, you net saving that year is RM6000.  The next year at the age of 25, you are doing fine at work. But because now you have to pay for car every month, your total monthly saving is cut down to about RM400. You save roughly about RM5000 that year. No bonus that year because your company is doing poor. So, your total saving in the bank is RM11,000. Then, you decide to get engaged with your girlfriend. She said OK. So, need to buy an engagement ring. RM1500 is spent on ring plus 'hantaran pertunangan'. So, your net saving that year is RM9,500.  The next year at the age of 26, you get promoted. Your salary now is 1.5 of your starting salary at the company. Good news! You think. "Ok, this year I will get married". You also are 'gersang' already.  So, you ask your fiancée "how much is the dowry (hantaran)? " She say, "berapa-berapa yang u sanggup". You ask,"RM5000 ok?". She replies, "I okay je. Tapi my mom tu. Dia kata grad oversea macam I ni mane boleh letak rendah-rendah. Paling kurang RM10,000 tau!".  Your eyes 'terjegil', your tounge 'meleleh' and you faint on the spot. "Where else in the world can I get extra money?", you say to yourself. But, because you are very determined to get married with your dream girl and in the name of love, you work really really hard that year until you are awarded "The Best Employee of The Year". You get 3 months of bonus. You also do some side business to supply ayam pencen. So, roughly your net saving at the end of that year is RM20,000.  Ok, now you are 27 years old with enough saving in the bank to pay for the dowry. But then, come your mom saying,"Anak mak nak kawin ni mesti la buat grand grand. Kita sewa khemah besar-besar, jemput penyanyi ke artis ke sorang dua datang buat persembahan. Lauk pauk kita cater aje la ya? RM10 je sekepala. Baju kawin ko, kita sewa yg cantik-cantik dan mahal-mahal sket. Kita jemput dalam 1000 orang datang ok?"  You did a quick in-the-head-calculation, "1000xRM10=RM10,000, penyanyi lagi, khemah lagi, buta-buta je RM15,000!!! Tu tak masuk cincin kahwin lagi!!" You say,"Mak, nak buat apa membazir-bazir duit ni?" Your mom replies,"Apa pulak membazirnya? Kau kawin sekali je seumur hidup. Biarlah buat betul-betul." You insist,"Tapi mak?" Your mom says, "Dahlah, kau jangan nak buat malu mak. Cik Tipah jiran kita tu buat kenduri kat hotel siap dato, datin, tan sri puan sri lagi datang. Mana la mak nak letak muka kalau buat kenduri kecik kecik?".  Anyway, you finally get married. But, a beautiful happy life after marriage that you dream of with your wife does not last long. You have debts around your waist, interest gets higher every month, cannot afford to pay them, you wife gets tired of you asking money from her, she accuses you of being irresponsible husband for not being a good provider, blah blah blah? At the end, you two go into separate ways? You get divorced.  Problem breeds problem? Sometimes we wonder why marriage institution is failing in our country. The above example may not represent the whole phenomena in our culture, but perhaps it gives us some ideas of the problems young couple these days are facing in getting married from my perspective.  The Root Cause of The Problem...  There is something wrong in our culture. I really think there are some practices in our culture in Malaysia (Malay culture specifically) that do not make sense and especially they are contrary to the teaching of Islam. These practices are well-rooted in our culture that unfortunately because of them, many people are 'afraid' to get married, or simply feel like they cannot afford when they are actually can afford. These are some of my observation and summary analysis:  (1) Marriage should be done in the most modest way but in Malaysia, it is ought to be done in the most lavish way. Competition on whose wedding is the most grandeur is almost unavoidable. Fame is usually the reason why people spend unreasonable and wasteful amount of money for a wedding.  (2) The "price" of a woman is measured according to her perhaps educational background, physical attributes and family social status not according to her knowledge and understanding of Deen and piety as suggested by the religion. The saddest thing is that "price" is put on women, who are supposed to be, if God-loving, kind-hearted and pious ones, "priceless"! 'Dowry' system is adopted by the Malays from perhaps the Indians who came to Malaysia long time ago. When the 'dowry' is put too high and men can't afford to pay, marriage is usually delayed or cancelled. An effort to build another small brick unit of this Deen is delayed or perhaps destroyed only for this reason.  (3) Marriage should be a quick and easy process for the couple not hard, which eventually becomes a burden. These days, we make marriage so complicated that people are afraid of getting married. When I was in the US, I saw Muslim brothers and sisters getting married at the mosque, with just some sweets as the main course for the guests. The guests who were invited to witness the ceremony were usually whoever prayed jemaah at the mosque or some close relatives and friends. There is no point of being extravagance. We should focus on the life after wedding not the wedding itself.  Wedding is only a door to the marriage house. Why should we spent a lot of money to decorate the door so beautifully, when the inside of the house is then left empty, dark and unattractive?  ....and the pressure is on men...

      Today, from 9-12pm I watched the Cassini satelite enter into Saturn's orbit. This spacecraft travelled 900 million miles all the way to Saturn, and this whole journey took 7 years! Isn't it amazing?  The reported speeds to which the craft is travelling relative to Saturn is >30km/sec, which translates to 66,000 miles per hour or 106,500 km/h.. now that's wickid.. It would be like travelling from Penang to Brunei (1500 km) in 50 seconds!  Later at 10, I'll be watching the NASA Satelite feed via National Geographic. I think we'll be seeing the first images taken of Saturn's rings. One thing that bothers me tho, is the cost of the project: US$3.3 billion. In a time where 1/5 of the world is living on an income below US$50 a month, people are actually splashing such large sums of money on space exploration... all in the name of Science and the "spirit of exploration".  In other news, I skipped Malay classes today. Just felt the need for a sabbatical... nope.. just a rest! As ranted over and over again, I study 6 days a week and travel 15 km to college everyday... so its time for a break. Watching the TV isn't exactly every parent's dream-activity for their child to do, but ... what the heck. Hopefully, as the 2nd semester approaches on Aug 15, they'll somehow fit in morning and afternoon classes into one single day. FYI, I study either from 9:30am - 1:00pm or 2:00pm to 5:30pm with 30 mins break in between.  Oh, my prediction of the footie scores this morning turned out the opposite... Portugal 2 - Holland 1.. Its good to see Man U's youngster, Ronaldo flourishing in such a prestigeous event. AS usual, the referees were biased towards the home team, Portugal. Every 50-50 decision went for them. Its unfair, but that's the way the cookie crumbles! All the best to Ronnie and the Portugese team. I hate that deco guy tho, and the diving antics... Them portugese like to DIVE alot. Haha....

AMAZING!!!!!  A  SHOCKING  news straight from the United Kingdom's "The Sun"...   Gay to go, Cristiano  Whizkid winger Cristiano Ronaldo, 19, has been voted Portugal's sexiest pin-up - by his country's gay association.  -Staff reporter, The Sun  Geeze..  Anyway, Holland meet Portugal tonight, so, gonna stay up late! Whee!!!

      Today is my parent's 3rd day of the week travelling 40km to and from Bukit Mertajam. They're finding tenants to stay at our home, cuz its a waste if we only stay there during the weekends, and on the other days, left empty. Apparently, today's deal didn't work out. Racial issues I shan't touch on. Hehe...  Got some pics using my  urlLink Zire 71 handheld .. some taken a week ago, and some just today.  First off: Today, housecleaning. Which means...     MONITOR TRASHING! . Yupp, it aint displaying properly oredi..  Then, the poor kitten got stuck at the drain!    And I thought cats knew how to climb well! Apparently  NOT      There were actually TWO kittens falling into the same drain! Haha..     Thankfully, dad had the pity to rescue 'em.. This pic doesn't quite show what I saw: Mum's love. Even tho it was so dirty, she licked her kitten up repeatedly till its "sparkling clean!" Yupp..     The discarded monitor.. *sniff sniff* - Cat     "Hey, check out this fan".. "No, wait a sec, lemme finish with the monitor first!"     Liang.. the hardworking and smart dude. Skateboards - but never crosses the "drain" successfully. n00b! Reasons that "aiyah, study too much mah, no time to sk8!"     Just an update on how I look ;)     A doggie I saw at an eating place.... VERY HUGE! (5 feet long)     No, this isn't a rehearsal for a play! Our Mongolian friend, Jack, actually dozed off last Friday during the Telecom class. He watched the Euro Eng v Por game. So did many others, but he looked pretty tired.  Indices and Log test tomorrow! Argh.. gotta do well! Also, badminton and frisbee with the dudes in Engineering!

Capped it off with some Chinese literature he wrote. Sunday came and went. Oh, we're renting out the house at BM. A couple of Indian dudes are moving in. Its better than leaving the house unoccupied from Monday - Sat morning.  Hopefully, my next Sem schedule doesn't have classes on Saturday. ITs a pain, especially now I'm obliged to pay $2 for the parking after that parking ticket I got! Hehe.. Actually, its reasonably safe to park for FREE by the roadside, but.. its better safe then sorry. U never know these valdals and ppl NBTD who scratch cars with coins! Lol...  Wed will be Indices & Log test and Sat will be Computer Usage test.. They're actually gonna test me on what i do best! [wa haha haha...]  Saturday, I had a glimpse of hope for getting broadband again. There were some contractors with large steel cables at our ground floor. They seem to be pulling some wire. I think Streamyx will soon, really very soon, come to Pip! IT really sux, when your other friends are paying 1/3 of what you pay, and get 6 times as fast speeds and unlimited usage. Screw technological limitations! haha..  Its been raining for the past SO MANY days. Nice to sleep, but in my exam time... Sigh!  Eh, gtg, explain later!

      Life is great, as usual. But with 13 more days til the dreaded end of term exams, I think I'm presently in deep sh!t... Haven't started studying, haven't started with the Telecom mini project which involves a presentation in the big lecture theatre in front of the big boss of the school... what's more.. I'm supposed to watch 3-4 episodes of Star Wars for Telecom class to summarise their Telecommunications systems and give my opinion on whether its feasable, etc... Crazy!  There's replacement class tomorrow, so I'll be doing 9-5! Eeek... Life is tough.  Btw, I'm reading a 1994 published book on "Do I need to go to school to be rich and happy?" What's your opinion? It basically deals with the present education system which merely tests on one's ability to memorise facts, and doesn't nurture the other talents that we possess... U know, everytime u get good "grades" you're probably that fortunate 20%... the other 80% go home to their parents and face disappointment. You're effectively pushing them down, so that the "system" will classify you as "smart"..

         A mother passing by her daughter's bedroom was astonished to see the  bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then she saw an  envelope propped up prominently on the center of the bed. It was  addressed,"Mom."    With the worst premonition, she opened the envelope and read the  letter with trembling hands:      Dear Mom,    It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to  elope with my new boyfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with dad and you.    I've been finding real passion with John and he is so nice - even with all his piercings, tattoos, beard, and his motorcycle clothes. But  it's not only the passion mom, I'm pregnant and John said that we will be very happy.    He already owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. He wants to have many more children with me and  that's now one of my dreams too.    John taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be  growing it for us and trading it with his friends for all the cocaine  and ecstasy we want.    In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so  John can get better; he sure deserves it!!    Don't worry Mom, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of  myself. Some day I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to  know your grandchildren.      Your daughter,  Judith    PS: Mom, none of the above is true. I'm over at the neighbor's house.    I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than  my report card that's in my desk center drawer. I love you!  Call me when it is safe for me to come home.

      Discover the 90/10 Principle. It will change your life (at least the way you react to situations). What is this principle? 10% of life is made up of what happens to you. 90% is decided by how you react.   What does this mean? We really have no control over 10% of what happens to us. We cannot stop the car from breaking down; the plane being late in arriving, which throws our whole schedule off. A driver may cut us off in traffic. We have no control over this 10%. The other 90% is different. You determine the other 90%.   How? By your reaction. You cannot control a red light, but YOU can control how you react. Let's use an example. You are eating breakfast with your family. Your daughter knocks over a cup of coffee on to your business shirt. You have no control over what just happened.   What happens next will be determined by how you react. You curse. You harshly scold your daughter for knocking the cup over. She breaks down in tears. After scolding her, you turn to your spouse and criticize her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the table. A short verbal battle follows. You storm upstairs and change your shirt. Back downstairs, you find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school. She misses the bus. Your spouse must leave immediately for work. You rush to the car and drive your daughter to school. Because you are late, you drive 110km/h! in a 80 km/h speed limit. After a 15-min delay and throwing $300 and some demerit points (traffic fine) away, you arrive at school. Your daughter runs into the building without saying goodbye. You arrive at the office 20mins late, because of how you reacted in the  morning.   Why did you have a bad day?  A) Did the coffee cause it?   B) Did your daughter cause it?   C) Did the policeman cause it?   D) Did you cause it?    The answer is obviously YOU. You had no control over what happened with  the coffee. How you reacted in those five seconds is what caused your bad day.   Here is what could have and should have happened. Coffee splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently say, "It's ok honey, you just need to be more careful next time". Grabbing a towel you rush upstairs. After grabbing a new shirt and your briefcase, you come back down in time to look through the window and see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You and your spouse kiss  before you go to work. You arrive five minutes early and cheerfully greet the staff. Your boss comments on how good the day you are having.   Notice the difference? Two different scenarios. Both started the same. Both ended different. Why? Because of how you REACTED. YOU really do not have any control over 10% of what happens.  The other 90% was determined by your reaction.   Here are some ways to apply the 90/10 principle. If someone says something negative about you, don't be a sponge.   Let the attack roll off like water on glass. You don't have to let the negative comment affect you. React properly and it will not ruin your day. A wrong reaction could result in losing a friend, being fired, getting stressed out, etc. How do you react if someone cuts you off in traffic? Do you lose  your temper? Pound on the steering wheel and hurt your own fingers? Do you curse? Does your blood pressure rocket? Do you try and bump them?   WHO CARES if you arrive 10 secs later at work? Why let the cars ruin your drive? Remember the 90/10 principle, and do not worry about it. You are told you lost your job. Why lose sleep and get irritated? It will work out. Use your worrying energy and time into finding another job. The plane is late; it is going to mangle your schedule for the day. Why take out your frustration on the flight attendant? She has no control over what is going on. Use your time to study, get to know the other passengers. Why get stressed out? It will just make things worse.   Now you know the 90-10 principle. Apply it and you will be amazed at the results. You will lose nothing if you try it. The 90-10 principle is incredible. It seems simple commonsense but very few apply this principle!  The result? Millions of people are suffering from undeserved stress, court trials, problems and heartaches. They never seem to be a success in life. Bad days follow bad days. Terrible things seem to be constantly happening. There is constant stress, lack of joy, and broken relationships. Worry consumes time. Anger breaks friendships and life seems dreary and is not enjoyed to the fullest. Friends are lost. Life is a bore and often seems cruel.  Does this describe you? If so, do not be discouraged. You can be different! Understand and apply the 90/10 principle. It will change your life!

      Just downloaded the last last episode of friends. Ahh... its so sad seeing a great show end.. but that's the way it goes! I started getting hooked on Friends when it appeared on Star World, quite a while ago.  Anyway, I also downloaded the Matthew Parry Punk'd video, which was cool.. And if you're interested in any friends episode, go to irc.irchighway.net #downloadfriends channel.  My todo list: 1. BM Ulasan 2. Semiconductor assignment (BJT & MOSFET difference) 3. Telecom - Star Wars communications 4. Telecom - mini project (which is not-so mini after all) about Cellular Technology 5. Study for all 5 subjects which tests are coming up in 6 days time.  Ahhhh....  Btw, does putting your handphone in the pants pockets hurt one's fertility? Cuz, my dad thinks so... ???

      Thank God the tough papers are done with. Now its that Computer lab test, all MS Office work. It should be a breeze!    Sis Olivia and Anthony are coming back tonight. And tomorrow, baby Samuel, koko and Pauline will come back.. and we'll be a "happy big family".. for  a day or so...    Next Monday will be the Telecom presentation, on Cellular Networks. Haven't really prepared, but what the heck! It should be fun, we're gonna act like some senior engineer performing a keynote :P yea, right.....    Got some sleep just now... And had weird dreams. Dreamt of the councillor days "back then in Secondary school"... and the fun I had then, and all the things they do. Creepy.. Can't seem to get the past out of my head. Just like.. many other things that haunt you while you're asleep! lol...    Guess that's about it...      Jack, a smart businessman, talks to his son  Jack: I want you to marry a girl of my choice  Son : "I will choose my own bride".  Jack: "But the girl is Bill Gates's daughter."  Son : "Well, in that case..."    Next Jack approaches Bill Gates  Jack: "I have a husband for your daughter."  Bill Gates : "But my daughter is too young to marry."  Jack: "But this young man is a vice-president of the World Bank." Bill  Gates : "Ah, in that case..."    Finally Jack goes to see the president of the World Bank.  Jack: "I have a young man to be recommended as a vice-president."  President : "But I already have more vice-presidents than I need."  Jack: "But this young man is Bill Gates's son-in-law." President : "Ah,  in that case....." This is how business is done!!

      Well, today's the day! My brother from S'pore just called and he's on his way here to Penang now.. gonna be seeing my little 1.5 year old nephew who can talk abit now.. Heheh.. he's so cute!    But I've got star wars project to complete, and Telecom to study! Hope it won't be too much of a distraction. Anyway, exams have been mixed. Semiconductor was really "tough".. hoping for better luck for the final two papers. Micro app on Saturday is basically playing with MS Office, so, that's easy!    There's F1 this weekend, in Germany. Ferrari's domination has been overwhelming. Sorta kills the fun, yea.. but there's still "abit" of fun left, isn't there?    Well, my e-mail is abit empty, so if you like, piptech@gmail.com , ok? ZZzzz.. now back to studies and assignment :(

      Just came back from hometown BM.. Since its the holidays, dad & mum decided to do some gardening back at our home there.. spent 2 nites, and had to come back becuz of class 2mrw. It'll be the final torturing malay class.. and exams will be on aug4th.  i'm thinking of revamping this piptech.org .. as u know,  urlLink http://start.piptech.org  is now functioning.. and i'll soon be getting rid of my "blog".. instead, i'll post pictures, and it'll be a picture-blog like  urlLink http://thebroken.org  (moblogs). why? as they say, pictures speak a thousand words! also, typing out personal stuff aint that fun after all.. :P  maybe if i mail my buddies individually, instead of forcing them over, wud be a better idea.. also the burden of updating this thing is painful.. altho, fun and rewarding.... but painful :P  see how it goes.. 2mrw i'll be bz, but then, will find them to "intergrate newer technologies onto existing infrastructure!"... tata..

      Whee.. for the 2nd week straight, the guy I voted for on Malaysian Idol happens to be the top (i.e. receiving the most votes)..    Last week, I voted for Vick cuz he's Chinese (yeah, I'm racist!).. but also partly cuz he's so determined, and not putus asa so soon! Then, I got this tip from  urlLink Radiance  to vote for Andrew, so I did, and whee.. my 70 sen didn't go to waste! Man, I'm just happy for these dudes.    Tomorrow is the day of wreckening! A telecom project that carries 20 marks that we have put oh so little effort on. We're dead. I'm dead. Oh so dead. Yeah, just dead! Gonna try to dish up a PPT presentation in 15 minutes and prepare my speech, lets say, 2 hours before "showtime"??    After that, I'll be away for a week in BM.. or maybe less, cuz I gotta go for BM class (malay).. hehe  urlLink

      Spent Mon - Tue in BM, and now, cutting a couple of CDs for a friend, Jacob. I'm gonna restructure my site, with room for pictures and all.. I want it as integrated as possible, so for now.. I'm on a hiatus of some sort ;-) whee!!  This weekend, i'm off to KL for foodtasting for my sister's wedding. My 2 cents are needed, see :P Then, I'll be visiting relatives in various places around Malaysia.. so I won't be back til before school reopens (13 Aug)  My Need For Speed installation DVD screwed up, and is now unreadable.. And as I was thinking of a complete Windows XP reinstall, the damned disk spoils again! I've got 3 copies of Win XP, and none of them work! I didn't know CDs were that vulnerable! lol...  If I'm lucky, dad will let me drive a few stretches... imagine, 110k/h legal speed limit (160, very common) ;) hehehe.... Hence, I need to "practise" in my NFS!  Rest assured, I'll keep you updated with photos and all as soon as I get back! Meanwhile, I'm reachable on the road at  urlLink pip@piptech.org  ... I'll check my mail there! Gimme an SMS +601 6 2482344 ok?  Take care, all!
