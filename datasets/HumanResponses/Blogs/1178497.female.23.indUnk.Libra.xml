       ..when talking to a pair of cymbals   My babyfaced cubicle mate is a sweet young thing that is the devil.  There is something about her wistful eyes and childlike excitement that makes me smile and occasionally combust into waves of nausea. Lilo, fairly new to the department like myself, hailed from the darkest slums of KL that contradicted her striking porcelain doll appearance and naïveté that was as perpendicular as a banana tree.   Her honesty can be rather awkward at times, though it has become a source of entertainment to the ageing mules at the office. She likes to share drama Spektra stories of her family very openly; about her maniacal knife-wielding sister-in-law and the bomoh neighbour that kept sending toyols and pelesits to bite her ass in the middle of the night.Most of the time she drones on and on about how her dad can hardly put together money to maintain the only car they have (it got repossessed last month by the way) and her disrespect for her cross-eyed ceti mother that’s always pressing for money to get lottery tickets.She speaks with such optimism and upbeat innocence that puts me to shame, thinking how fortunate I am to be blessed by God with able parents that I do not need to worry about fighting my way into two buses, two express trains and one cab to work every single day.  I suppose that kind of admiration could grow old.  For a while now I’ve noticed, for someone who has not all the luxuries of life, Lilo is a monstrous brag. Firstly, she claims that she has a terrible temper, a `rebel’ at all costs.  “Awak tau,jangan sekali orang buat kita marah.Sebab kalau kita marah kita boleh tumbuk orang.Kalau tak tumbuk pun kita boleh sampai ke tahap bunuh.Boss kita tuh, kita pedulik apa..kita selalu lawan dia apa.”   A few days ago she cried when queried on the whereabouts of her boss's stapler she misplaced.Cheh.  She also assumes from my dishevelled anti-Monday fashion sense that I have no knowledge whatsoever of make-up or Cosmo mags.I pretend to be interested when she boasts about her MAC (that she sadly pronounces mak) eyeshade collection,Redken hair products and irrelevant `aku sorang je lawa' vibes.  “Awak tau, makeup MAK ni mahal tau…tak boleh dapat kat sini..ini pun kita pesan dekat kawan kita kat Singapore.”   “Kita kena jaga badan, nanti laki tak mau tau, kena mandi lulur, mandi rempah mandi bunga…bagi kulit halus…tak macam ni ..” she says, patting my coarse and hairy arm.  “Kita banyakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk sangat peminat.Kita ada boyfriend sekarang ni pun kita ramai stok boyfriend lain.Yang terdahulu, yang terakru….”   Does it ever cross her mind that I  have  gone to school for the past 15 years? That I was not born in a cave, but bred in the serene, suburban and chic hills of Damansara? Dare she think I am as kampung as she is? I would want to give her some credit. There were no double standards just because I have a more  priviliged life than she, was nurtured with at least some class and the fact that I have had more than 5 boyfriends in spite of my `kulit kering yang tak cukup Vitamin C' as she had mildly put it.  I have never judged her because of her background or stature, even if she says things like `I am 21st years old' I would naturally love to condemn.As a concerned colleague,I patiently and tactfully correct her whenever she makes a complete tit out of herself especially when she uses all the wrong words to sound cool.  “Eh, Jayjay hari ni pakai baju baru.. kerek  betul!!”   “ …mamat tuh baik and kelakar.Dia suka buat lawak  toron  dengan kita.”  “Erm..kita kadang-kadang malas nak layan boss kita tuh sebenarnya..so bila dia marah macam mana pun kita buat muka  poyo  je….”  Things like these make me fear for her existing social circle.  Lastly,knowing Malays, it is quite a wonderment to have relatives living overseas.Lilo likes to emphasise many,many times that she has a sister studying in some Pensylvannia uni.I had happily quipped that I too have twin sisters doing their degrees at two different sides of the continent, but I guess Lilo wouldn’t have cared even if I had wings and flew around garbage cans and dog shit in my free time.  “ Awak tau, dekat US, barang murah tau.Adik kita cakap, dia beli cordless phone dia USD 19 aje.Murah kan?Best laaaa duduk overseassssss!!!!” she says ever so gedikly.  “Cordless phone tu phone rumah,bukan handphone.Kalau convert duit Malaysia..3.8x USD19=RM 72.Mahal la tuh.Kalau beli kat Makro Shah Alam tuh tak sampai RM 30 pun,” I try to intervene her ditzy thoughts with pure logic.  “Apa la awak ni.Murahlah kalau USD 19.Macam kita punye RM 19," she replies after a long pause (maybe thinking what a maths idiot she really is but too proud to admit it) ,"Dah la barang-barang dia hantar ke rumah.Kita boleh order je online.Canggih tau negara diorang!Negara kita mana ada technology order-order kat Internet ni.Kalau awak nak apa-apa barang cakap tau.Kita boleh suruh adik kita belikan.”  My thought bubble goes squiggly.

       sadness part I    I couldn’t help but look like a dejected bastard today.  I am wearing clothes I outgrew three years ago to work, feeding on the glorious leftovers of every office meeting’s refreshment table and I haven’t been buying anything for myself for the past few months; except for that compulsive ADSL modem purchase to save my sisters from ripping each other’s throat when it came to who's-turn-issit-to-surf-the-internet arguments.I am  horribly broke.  The days tick by slowly. Work is dreary (worst, there are handsome men here who never take fat-assed women that is I, seriously). Payday had just passed, and my account has already been wiped out clean.  I am suffocating.  And there it was, the hope that was certain- the truth about the so-called talent I had. The offer was lucrative.And the work?It was damned kacang if I might put it in that sense.So I grabbed it, looking forward to have some cold hard cash that could at least cover some of the many expenses I was burdened with.   I tried my luck, but yeah, people strike out.  The client is a fickle person.She said I was good. And I actually I believed her.Now she doesn’t think that anymore.I wish I had taken Bebop’s advice to quote on my services in legal black and white instead of an oral arrangement that made me the sucker in the end .The cruelty of it all.After 40 pages of mental torture, the precious banana sessions I had to forgo, staying up in the wee hours of the morning; the client does not want me to write for them anymore.  Did you hear that? Did not want me to write anymore.  My world just turned to black.

       pulp friction    There is definitely something missing out of the the global film industry nowadays.  Uhm,good movies?  Bebop was enthusiastic about manning our celibacy with a healthy itinerary of recreational activities.Now that my mental reflexes are getting more and more disfunctional,I let Bebop decide what we should do to remedy the dry spell of our post-vacation blues.Initially he had spurred the petrifying idea of midnight futsal.I eat now about 5 times a day and I hardly find the strength to look at the mirror, what more run around aimlessly for a ball with my jiggling thighs in front of many judgemental strangers.It was either that or hanging out with his pak guard friend at the creepy Pencawang Elektrik at BU.  So we went back to doing something we both liked, downing popcorn like cookie monsters where no one could see you-at the cinemas.  How jinxed were we with our efforts that every single movie we watched since then had sucked.   Hidalgo  was the first out of many disappointments, sweaty Viggo Mortensen and his sexy cleft chin excused.The three-hour feature about horses was terribly as exhausting as the whole endurance race across the African continent concept, something they should have condensed into a Hallmark or HBO family movie instead.  It was as exciting as the corn growing out of my left wrist.  Meanwhile,the `critically-acclaimed'  Buli  penned by Afdlin Shauki and Hans Isaac was only O.K. to my standards come to think of it.Even with a gifted comedian, a great actor and a rather catchy title I feel as if the duo failed to work their way through the small details of the story.What was Afdlin thinking when he said that Buli was Cannes/Sundance material??Nevermind the unnecessary Shuhaimi Baba 30-odd-all-star cast trick that resulted in loose ends and too many subplots that didn't work.In my opinion it was only Jalil Hamid who saved the day at the psychiatric ward, simply because he was cross-eyed and made a lot of rambling sense in spite of it all.The movie did not serve any other important function than telling the audience that the movie is Afdlin's, so his message was: laugh at me because I am a wimpy fat person.I felt almost sorry for him that I didn't.  I do not want to be biased.I will have to say that  50 First Dates  was boring because Sandler had lost it (sorry Angel Islington spoil hang belum tgk lagi).The repetitive day-in-day-out routine grew old somewhere in the middle.And Drew Barrymore was typically trying to reinvent the whole Wedding Singer era of sweetness and 100% innocence that was nauseating (I still think she ain't gorgeous) with Sandler drooling profusely at her feet.Please la.   Hellboy  on the other hand proved that even the most evil creatures on earth are sissies and can be defeated with one teeny sword whisked off a stone sculpture.I mean, whatever happened to adrenaline-pumping and suspenseful endings?Give me back my money!  And, the last straw came during the previous weekend.I and Bebop watched the most predictable whodunit movie in history,  Taking Lives .First of all, they shouldn't have had a flashback of the young serial killer who had the exact same teeth structure as Ethan Hawke's, right before the opening credits.Just how many actors in the world have narrowed front pearlies like his anyway huh?Any jackass would have come to a conclusion 15 minutes into the story.DOH.  This blows.

       Southern Comfort   The nervewrecking national lampoon trainee executive mini-series' 1/3 over.  I was assigned to my own hotel room after the whiny delegates had vocally refused to share beddings among each other.Which was a blessing that I got to watch AI finals in definite peace with a 29-inch flat screen TV and relish Fantasia's triumph to myself (I knew mah nigga would win the competition the moment she sang that `Something To Talk About').I also took the opportunity to jump on the beds, whack the life out of the beautiful pillows and thrash the place with chocolate wrappers.  All in all, the JB `gig' was a success.A colleague and I drove down the Seremban-Malacca highway safely with my parents' sedan in fear of my own vehicle's possible breakdown(s).Zemi was good company, only it was evident she did not want to switch drivers at Pagoh like she had initially promised.I drove 800 kilometres in total, to and fro while listening to her bitch about the other 5 team members who were transported by flight.She had some serious interpersonal issues,that woman.   And,the seminar went smoothly without a hiccup (except the part where the emcee made us stand up and sing the company's newly composed anthem).I suppose the participants were ecstatic because it was a Friday. It was unofficial company policy that 70% of employees disappear after solat Jumaat and resurface only on Monday, so the seminar had to sail like the wind itself.So it did,hence my narcissistic team leader was surprisingly aghast to have witnessed my competence and proceeded to give me a good hearty slap on the back.That sweet yet painful gesture must have been the best feeling I've had in ages.   I also got to meet my Aunt Nem in Skudai, whose place I managed to find in the far ceruk of JB with a failing phone battery.Pretty much saddens me to know that won't have any relatives to visit or pester for a free dinner at my next stops of N.S. and Malacca in June.  One down, two to go.

       road trip   After four months and 13 days holding little cause and effect at the workplace, I am finally being outstationed with orders from the management. I mean, more than 30 kilometres off the spaceship's radius.  Right down the causeway, baby.  I wonder what is it that got into my boss's mind.Whatever makes him think that a fumbling,inexperienced young doofus like myself is capable of gathering 300-odd telecommunication geeks of the southern region at one fateful communion?   (They will pay for this).  I was appointed `The Coordinator' and ever since, the team I was assigned to (heck, myself sometimes) forgot my real name.   `Hey coordinator this!'.  `Hey coordinator that!'.  In short, a coordinator in my office dictionary basically means:   Coordinator  1 (n)  cow ;has to do every single thing e.g  colour the titles of the goddamn presentation slides ~(v)  balachi ; to make reservations for Fantastica! tickets that had no particular relevance to the project.  Though, the relatively small role in the Fab 3 had proved fruitful after all.I took the challenge like an adult, in spite of all the tentative logistics,snotty liaisions and fickle participants that couldn't tell the difference between `single deluxe' and `deluxe suite'.  So tomorrow's the big day.Let's see if I could really make-over my entourage, interior the musty JB seminar room and culture the presentations viva Richard Simmons.  (Zu-zush).

       R.I.P Rapunzel   I have finally said goodbye to the long locks I’ve so much pressured myself with just to prove that I could grow them down to my nipples.  It feels weird, after almost three years of moist ,unnecessary itchings  on my delicate scalp and neck; that my tresses were gone with a few snips. Then it boiled down to a mixture of sadness and triumph. Clenching the dead strips of hair in my hand,I bade adieu to all the bloody dandruff and thousands of ringgit worth of colouring,decolouring,drying, perming that has been worth nothing.   Hello  to the new Foxy.

      ..  Talk about being pregnant, I hurried to the nearest drugstore to get one of them twenty ringgit pee sticks. It suddenly dawned upon me that I haven’t had a single drop of bloody menses for 5 months now. Not to mention my fluctuating weight (I've ballooned back to 80 kgs worth of meat),horrific dreams of baby barf and that dumbass concierge from Yuni’s wedding reception who gave me a yellow rose in honour of Mother’s Day.  Now, now.   I have never been so paranoid before in my entire life.All this while being dry of hormones, humour and monthly ovulations have become my opulent trademarks.Then there was the unplanned Genting honeymoon and a friend's 8-month foetus abortion Heidi was telling me about. My face started to grow a little yahoo hijau especially because I had just published my mumsy aspirations so earnestly a few days before.  The results came like the `one minute wonder' it claimed to be on the reverse side of its packaging.Turned out that I was not pregnant-just plain fat.   A rather displeasing thought, but a happy one nevertheless.

      I want to have a baby.  Obviously not out of wedlock, silly.Of course like other women, I am dreaming of a legitimately happy family with a child of my own, preferably 3 boys, a girl or better yet a few pairs of twins so I wouldn't have to give birth just too many times.Hah.The feeling hit me like a thunderbolt very recently, a rekindling of  my femininely intact childhood.I rummaged the house last night for the perfumed diary I jotted on when I was eleven that had the most beautiful of babies' names; a collection from many books and groovy tv shows by my then geeky unpopular self for future reference.I was actually in tears when it was not found, possibly lost forever.  So much for macho Foxy.  I try to remain aloof and nonchalant about this whole institutional-marriage frenzy but seems that I cannot help but notice that I am missing something.In a few months I will turn 24 and nuptial invitation cards are piling up on my doorstep (accompanied by background music from Psycho).I grow jealous each day that everyone's actually starting somewhere, so assured of their commitment, so willing to sacrifice everything to start a family.I fear, even though I am attached to someone now, that I will have no one in the end to give me my babies!  It must have been Hitler and my brand new nephew who have been staying in my house for two months now.With Hitler Jr. around,my sister Crazy Chimp and I realize we are nimble and aptly equipped to handle the newborn and his tempestuos moodswings.I miss him when I am at work,when he's fast asleep, when he's out with his mum and dad.He looks exactly like me when I was a little nipper; he would only go to sleep if Auntie Foxy sang to him (even if it was something as stupid as the 10 budak hitam song).Then it dawned on me.I had, after all, motherly instincts I thought was gone when I started to stupidly pierce myself at miscellaneous bits.  Propose to me Bebop!Anybody!

       love's labour's holiday   The extra long weekend must have gotten into me.The high spirits, the lovely recreational activities that came with it got a lot of people into gear.I watched a funny movie (finally), mended some estranged ties with Lusa, went up to Genting to redeem a measly RM 36 points, and managed to spend some quality time with loved ones for a change.In the midst of all that hype,there was the mysterious disappearance of Kayu. I had looked for her at the floral garden and they told me she quit two weeks prior to that.Which was funny because everytime I saw her there were always stories about the restaurant and from what she had implied, she was still happily employed.What was she afraid of telling us, I wonder?  Missing persons aside - the highlight of the concurrent May public holidays was of course, Z/E's engagement. When we were younger, she always whined about how she'd be the last person out of us 5 to even get a boyfriend.Now not only has she a fiancee (a cute one too), a RM 10,000 hantaran and the bling bling resting on her finger, she'd also become someone's wife in 6 months.Sigh.That automatically enrols the remaining three (excluding the married Lusa) into an alarming race against time.  Losers.  When was the last I had so much thought of getting married?Hope was lost 2 years back when I was merely the concubine to a Punjabi pothead, believing there was no one out there waiting for me, to save me from a life of regrets and empty promises except for one lonely emotionless dut.  Then Bebop swept me of my feet, my potbellied knight in shining armour and all.  Somehow having a long, most routine relationship makes you dread sometimes, that you would spend the rest of your life with a guy that likes to burp and fart in your face.  I love my boyfriend, but I wonder if it is really him I am going to get hitched to, or am I just doing it because nobody else wants me as much?Or is it true when fortune-teller wannabe Ms Intan said , "I know you are going to marry somebody foreign, someone successful and someone far away from here."  Foreign.Successful.Far Away.Thehehe.  I'll keep crossing my fingers.

      The wonders of `Taman Selera Uptown’ would never cease to amaze me. I assume anyone who has set foot here within the last ten years (this including the heydays of its DIY canvas-roofed  mapley ) will acknowledge that it is definitely one of the most convenient makan places in the vicinity of Klang Valley, offering the most scrumptious kuey teow kerangs, sizzling steaks and nasi pattayas for under RM 10 at the expanse of the friendly PJ suburbs.    I was always fond of the place because it was like home away from home,frequently pondering on the strength I had-sitting on stationary picnic benches for hours of lepak and mindless chatter night after night.Then it  gets  to you.The place gained a sea of hungry, bored populace: the obnoxious crowd, the unbearable noise, the overrated `happening’  thingamajig going on.It was nauseating. It is as if no one had the slightest idea where to go after the clock strikes 8 pm,so Uptown  had  to be it.They were everywhere.Loners,couples,friends,the girly groups,the guy posses,families,gays,bisexuals,rempits,mat rocks,Good Morning towel do-ragged hip hoppers and sadly,poseurs who lamely proclaimed themselves `Uptowners’ (ack!).Even the traffic was like a mini Jalan Tun Razak on a shitty day with the eternal jam on a mere 500m stretch.And lets not start on the parking issue.If a conventional Kancil was capable of stuffing itself inside the street phone booth,you would actually see some.  Then what is it that keeps people coming?  I couldn't help but become bemused myself.During a recent visit I’ve discovered amidst some familiar,exciting sights that Uptown has now wee additions to the range of `services' under its belt.Bovril and I were attacked by VCD, DVD, polyphonic ringtone download, stolen shoes, phone housing, jagung rebus, bundle clothes and second hand remote control peddlers along our 15 minute scout.And that was only on a Thursday.Then it came to me,the reason why the whole concept was so special. Entertainment 101 :You don’t need to go to a fancy mall to watch a movie,grab a bite,shop for clothes, get a birthday present and date at the same time when you're at the legendary  Uptown .  It was like homecoming with a few renovations.

       So how would you like your death,rare or well done?    We regret to announce the untimely demise of Foxy Mama, who on the 1st of March of this year was carefully vaporized by several fat cows.  This unfortunate incident occurred in the forest in New York City.  The deceased was reported to have shouted "I should have listened to my horoscope!" just before expiring.  Foxy Mama is survived by Gladys Happyfoot, a trained chimpanzee.  Funeral services will be held the 1st of next month.    Thanks natinski.Predicting my demise was funny (for a minute).My advice, don't try  urlLink this  more than once,it gets to you.

      The whole career pep talk yesterday inspired me to do two things; even though it  was  meant for Kayu, Petdiba and Asbon.  I still am going to send a goofy audition video of myself to the Travel and Adventure Channel before the age of thirty, hopefully it will make me a writer (better yet compere *barf *) for any of the globe-trekking shows before I die a death of gum disease.  Another; say that I do not make it with my present occupation,I would want to get paid for watching movies and giving their makers a piece of my mind through my own healthy   critic column.I mean, might as well do something I really honestly passionately like, right?Now that I have just had an eyesore-ful of How to Lose A Guy In Ten Days on my wretched PC I feel that I should protect the interests of innocent filmgoers around the country at least. Thank God I didn’t take Bebop up on his suggestion to go `review’ it at the cinema because that, my friend, was probably the stupidest romantic piece of shite that wasted 90 minutes of my precious time. You don’t expect a women’s magazine to be brainlessly called  Composure  and that all intellectual,go-getting female writers look like Kate Hudson, do you?Please.Smart women don’t prance around looking for men in bars and wearing “oops one of my titties just popped outta my tiny blouse” thingies on an everyday basis,okay?Just not Meg-Ryansy cute enough.  Anyway; whatever my profession would be, I shall allocate all of my (future) annual leave for at least two vacations per annum. Y tu Mama had surprised me yesterday when she invited me to become her faithful chaperon on a road trip to Abednego’s NYC soon with little brother Johnny Brapian.I am quite excited, though cautioning myself against anymore false hopes.I have been disappointed 5 times before but should this plan finally materialize, I would probably be the happiest and most content middle child in the world.  By the way, I bumped into an old Yahoo Messenger flame circa Beta Year at lunch, who really did look extra yummy with those unbelievably toned biceps and a rather sexy parut kelapa `do. His Girlfriend, who was never aware of our virtual `courtship’, chirpily made us shake hands and talk to each other.Which felt really weird, because it suddenly flashed before me a lewd mental image of these two together; who according to his unashamed confessions, were sexually deprived maniacs that drove around Putrajaya naked in that rempit Kancil of his for fun.  I think that’s why I had eventually `broken up’ with him. Eeeeeeeeeee -uw.

       My Big, Fat, Green Wedding   I like some weddings. Other than the free food, you get to hang back with pregnant, married, if not funny,cynical and single friends while scrutinizing the multiple-tone-haired raver-bespectacled J.Lo wannabes who attended in teeny-weeny kebayas. In fact, I don’t mind going to a kenduri of people I barely know, for the sake of getting excited about  something .I needed the brouhaha anyway.  Yesterday I convoyed with the reunion of original Bukit Beruang `kedai makcik singgit lima posen' homeys to the nuptial ceremony of Mahjong’s brother.I realized on my way over to her obsessively green residence (and I mean green awnings,green gates,green windows-the works) that I am not the least bit close to Mahjong nor have I attended any of her lavish open houses and other special occasions she had so valiantly invited me to.And for a while there I felt a little embarrassed that I am about to turn up at a house of an influential politician without a proper gift and wearing a raggedy baju kurung with iron burn marks.  Actually,none of that had mattered.  The `extravagant’ affair turned out to be a funfair/joget lambak/SUKMA/ethnic karaoke competition that inspired most of us especially Bovril to learn and sing the Buaian language. A warm, fuzzy wedding so beautifully done, kampong style with additional speed fans to ease our  mentekedarah  rounds.Now thaaaaaaaaaat’s the way, baby.  I didn’t think I would have made it because initially I was busy with some freelance work. Yes, yes, I know I have sworn not to commit to such sacrilege again;but I am a sucker for men in dark blue denim and a crisp, fitting shirts. My  veryvirit  buddy Tong made me go to his office a few days before, using a printed copy of my text brochure as bait. I was only curious to know how it looked like, the useless last-minute secondary school English I had penned for a Muzium guide a few months ago.I went to see Tong's boss for my feeble payment; only to meet probably the most attractive, suave, charming yet  hideous  man I have ever seen in my entire life. The minute Tong introduced me to him I immediately said yes to the 120 page annual report translation job,to anything and everything that has to do with this delightfully revolting man with a wonderfully superb dress sense.  Then on Saturday while everybody else was out getting outfits for the Sepang rave, or watching the latest movies, or getting extravagant woven cloth for baju Raya, or boozing their brains out watching the World Cup at Hartamas Square; I was at home sweating the 40 degree-weather spread eagled on the bed with a notebook on my lap cursing myself and Cute Ugly Man for my unlikely weekend misery.  So thank you Mahjong, the very calming green aura of canopies,costumes and flowers; my lovely friends and the inexpensive Jawa/Mandailing/Minang/Madura band for cheering me right up.

      There are about 11 eligible and ageing `bachelorettes’ in my department where at least two-thirds of them are classified into the sophisticated and intelligent types;like an assortment of  Bebe Neuwirths in different shapes and sizes.One of them happens to be my pain-in-the-ass boss, who is not only very trendy in her Al-Munawarroh fashion sense but also quite a petite,attractive woman.She is 42 years old and once admitted to me that she never wants to get married, ever. I’ve wondered why.She is comfortable steering her own fate perhaps,that she has worked so hard to get to where she is now the possibility of sharing her  successes  with anyone else annoys her. Maybe,I presumed, the excuse of being alone relieves a woman from the many burdening responsibilities she was destined to have in the first place.  Or, she could just be another raging homosexual.  My boss has eternal PMS,nevertheless I find myself amused with her independence and headstrong opinions.She is,inside,a kind considerate person who only I could see as we work very closely.  Then there was that  nasty  rumour circulating around our tiny office space.Somebody’s mother's ex-boyfriend’s sister’s colleague’s brother-in-law’s niece who happens an ex-roomie to my cubicle neighbour had broken the news at one of them Tupperware parties. Apparently 10 years back, during my boss’s heydays as a lecturer at OTM she was a bad, bad girl.  She got caught `berkhalwat’ in a very awkward position with a married man on campus.  And so the word got out;the battalion of makciks in the office had synchronized their watches.I think everyone knows now about how she got sacked from her teaching career because of that hanky-pankying incident.She though, until today has no idea what is happening around her, the nasty whispers, the undecipherable `faces’ and cynical remarks around us.Perhaps her oblivion is trying save her some remaining dignity,who knows?  I wished I could pat her head, or give her a hug;that strong,hard-willed woman.But I just can't.I didn't want to seem like an accomplice to the whole situation.  She is only human, those pricks failed to notice. Nobody had the right to judge her, however buttnaked she was at the time of `capture’, or if the guy she dated had a dozen children and never intended to leave his wife for her.Really, no one wants to be punished by the past they needed to forget.  When I reflect back on my `young’ mistakes, I wouldn’t want them to escape the Pandora’s Box I’ve so brilliantly stored away as it had been done upon on her.  (Cringe).

      I totally forgot that I had won (again) two tickets to the premiere of `Honey’ starring Jessica Alba and her big-jugged b-girl crew courtesy of TGV screened last night.I had spent so much time frowning yesterday that I left my prize’s redemption printout somewhere near the shredder after non-deliberately deleting its softcopy from my PC.  I forgot that my working hours are from 8.30 to 5 so I went home at 4.30.I didn't have a cigarette since morning and I didn't eat the whole day. Because I forgot to. Food was scarce in the house, except for a bunch of slippery keli and this gooey yellow lauk Pops loved. I had made dinner plans with Bebop and it literally slipped off my mind, without realizing he was fuming at his place waiting for my call that I forgot to make because Y tu Mama send me off on her grocery errands. Then I forgot that I had no money to pay the atrocious parking fees at Giant/Parkson, so Cranky Chimp had to come over to lend me some cash, kind enough to cover the entry ticket and a lonely dinner at McDs (hallelujah!). I forgot that it was Bovril’s off day too, and I could’ve joined her at Uptown with Ngemon G for some succulent sizzling steak or oyster omellete with the extra stash. Instead I drove round my house about 4 times because my phone got barred and I couldn’t call anyone at home to tell them my I didn’t remember to bring my housekeys. Thank goodness Petdiba called me on impulse to tell me I was back from Singapore, so we headed to BU for a bunch of calming Big Macs with Heidi and Kayu.Hot topic was Kayu’s birthday that’s coming on the 17th- that obviously I forgot about.   Note to kids:   this is what happens when a person drinks from a coffee mug with two little ants swimming in it.Or stares into her own feces for inspiration of an excuse to not go to work every single day of the month.

       Dire Straits   The donut in front of me is salty, because I am weeping on it. I tried to eat the bastard because I was hungry, but it was yesterday’s pastry I had left in my drawer.I can’t afford the usual char kuey teow downstairs anymore and my stomach is rumbling from missing it. Money can make you smile, and money can make you shit in your pants too. The last time I peered into my  Ferrakamu  purse I had only RM 6 to last to the 25th of this month, though I might have fared better then Awonn, who up to yesterday is surviving on 60 sen and Ping Pong biscuits.(Panic).That's it,I’ve made my mind up; I am selling my `Fit and Fold Strider Treadmill’ to the evil CashConverting fashion victims of Tmn Mayong.Desperate times call for desperate measures. After all the useless health equipment had served no purpose other than an extended clothes hanger for Johnny Brapian the Yob (sorry twins, I have disappointed you both).I can't believe I am actually going through this like ye olde broke uni bum days again.  I’ve just checked out my petty cash status online, my other hopeful salvation. Out of the ridiculously large amount of RM 817.30 I have claimed for the outstationing to JB,my GM had major concerns about the  RM 5.80  toll receipts from my journey to a Shah Alam seminar two days prior to that.Because you could have taken the RM 1 Federal like everybody else,he says.Until he changes his bloody fickle mind about my `extravagant’ Sprint Highway spendings;the remaining RM 811.50 will have to wait.(Seethe).

      The weekend was peachy keen.Actually, I almost broke up with Bebop, for the foolish reason of arguing about spirulina prescriptions. But as usual, we made up like sheepish nursery school kids that fought over a basket full of blocks; so we’re all “oohh do you still love me?” and “I miss you even though we’ve just talked on the phone 5 minutes ago” type of thing.Bleurghhh.Nausea attack.   Among other things, Edduardo had resurfaced from the depths of stewarding and flight safety so we hung for hours yesterday, talking about life and love (and bits of gay sex) like old times.It was like catching up with an epic.Man, felt like it was just yesterday we were seated under the gazebo smoking 10 sticks of Marlboros at one go and planning our term project together as a team while he dodged occasional questions about his sexual orientation.Now he is a fashionable queer going places and I am a dead straight person who is going to be stuck in the same place for 8 more years of my life.   Anyway,back to being hunky dory,like I said-my days off were pretty interesting.The little one,Abednego has been back from NYC for almost a whole week now and as I write this,her twin Sabrosa is being deported from Heathrow to KLIA today. It’s like a Voltron re-assembling against the evil powers of our insane elder sister alias Cranky Chimp or something like that.The thought of hanging out in their room humouring wryly the enemy’s zits once again is quite magnificent, really.   The latest update of our quaint little house, a jealous Y tu Mama purchased a brand new DVD player after taking on a demo tour of the neighbour’s RM 32000 home theatre system.The spree gave Y tu Mama quite some satisfaction even though it only cost her RM 199  and  the thousand-plus-plus 29” TV. My brother-in-law Rico Suave and wedded wife Hitler who pitied us tech cavemen donated a bunch of old DVDs to warm the equipment with, one of them being the fifth season compilation of the famed Sex and The City. Yes, I am embarrassed to admit that I have NEVER watched a full episode of Sex in the short span of my adulthood and all this while I’ve always thought it was called `Sex  In  The City’. Dumbass. Slowly it is making sense in my head why friends have greatly acknowledged the brilliance of the series, pussy titty vibrator jokes and all packaged with a wad of  class .I had missed them all.  Of course,most importantly the dah demam thing has gotten into our AF posse at home. I must say I was proud to see that the least likely had sounded great on their first concert i.e the scrawny,nerdish architect’s son Khair; very Harvey Malaiholo potential.Kids without pubes were saying that he is really cute.Urm, yeah-a refined version of Gollum on one of his best days just ain’t my thang.So let’s put him under the  ugly  list.The ugly children of AF mostly fared well,like Zahid and the faggot Bob that was most made fun of because of his weight. I mean, just what is the freaking problem with these Malaysians? I thought his performance was impeccable. The judges kept telling him to lose the flab because it’s ruining his stamina on the asli Hail Amir song, Wajah Kesayangan Hamba.Like, wha-?The fat boy danced,sang and teased the audience without ever once running out of breath!Then why didn’t they say the same thing about Farah or Fitri or Anding or Mas’s and especially that sickening Edlin’s performance?Because they looked better than him, because they simply weren’t afro-haired or because they weren’t as dark?Oh, puh-leassseeeeeeeeee .If there's something the judges aren't doing here,is keeping it real.Seriously.  So let's not say another word about the worst performers of the night;the celebrities Linda, Adam and that troll-haired Fitri.Only two would suit the tragedy of their operas- they sucked .

       TGIF!   My boss is absent today, she beat me to my feverish  dudegimmeanMC  act so she would have ample time checking out MetroJaya’s last day of sale like she had so schemingly planned yesterday evening. As for me,there's 6 hours to go before I get to run off and see Halle Mama Jebon at Midvalley to share with her some juicy, mouth-watering, enzyme-conjuring gossip I’ve recently dug up from a rickety old closet.Man, it’s been ages since we have bitched. I love bitching. There is no need for yoga or repetitive rounds of sex to experience such Zen-like relief badmouthing people who have screwed you in the past and present.Especially when you do it(bitch,I mean)with your galpals (cue: hysterical laughter a’la Cruela de Ville, please).  So imagine how much I have bitched, being lé perturbed doormat that I am.  Today will be my last torpedo bitch.I solemnly promise to cut down on my bitchings to make room for a newfound passion and make peace with myself.If those fags from Queer Eye could do it,so why can’t I interior decorate my  own  pad?Y tu Mama Tambien has started to pester me about getting my own place a.k.a renting the terrace house in DU (which is hers by the way) so I’m gonna surprise her and take the offer anyhoo. If I’m really deciding to move out it should be in October, when the RMs are rollin’ in and if there are friends who are interested to become roomies with me (should they tolerate my Nasha Aziz household habits).

       The Return of the Ex   In my boredom I had nonchalantly e-mailed mah ex-best friend(if it is still),Yummy in request of her blog address. Which was funny because we have been at odds with each other for so long that I felt as if I was about to rob her house and asking her permission beforehand.I just wanted to know what was up with her if possible, whether she was still designing CDs or decorating her kitty litterbox or something.Being one of the best writers I know,it is quite impossible for someone as eccentric to not have a conventional online journal as per everyone else on the planet.Somehow with the painstaking proximity we had knitted in our teens and the exception of cutting our wrists to become blood sisters-I knew she would answer my silly little query.She gave it to me without any questions nor hassle and browsing through it was like unearthing a prized, ancient relic.It was almost magical.  Then there was a section in the blog she knew I would find; and it was a short paragraph on how she missed us,the whole lembu rock gang.And how I was part of `the backstabbing bunch’ who led the cows away from her pastures.  (Tear).  That’s not true.The generally classified `backstabbers’ didn’t ruin our psychotically healthy friendship. It was just  me . And her no-good shaggy boyfriend had a lot to do with it anyway. I guess I couldn’t stand it that he stole my best friend and made her his bride in Transylvania hell. Everything about him annoyed me.And what happened was  one  bloody miscommunication that turned everything topsy-turvy; about something he said that she said that I said that got to the rest of the gossiping cows that in the end became an inevitable warfare. Yummy &  Hairy 5’4” Jackass vs. The Cow. It’s just that when you’re madly in love, you think your friends are bad influence but your boyfriend is not; it can’t change anything.  I wish I could turn back time and apologize under more approriate circumstances.  Currently Yummy and I are back on speaking terms,some grown-up sort of thing. Though talking to her now is like being sent to the dentist,our awkward silence could drive mice crazy. We don’t hang out like the old days, nor meet each other casually like we used to.But at least we are still friends, though not  buddies .I’m glad she and her Hairy Jackass broke up three years back.There was on one ocassion he and I crossed paths at a club,and he had grabbed me for a smooch to remind him of her.  It’s not just him who is missing her.I am too,very much.

       at the stars   My luck ain't so shitty after all. In March I won a standard Monopoly set through an SMS contest (Malaysian version); though cost me RM 600 in phone bills to obtain. Last month, shortly before I fired my Indon masseuse, I was awarded a serai wangi minyak urut cum insect repellent cum aromatherapy oil at one of those makcik-makcik Tupperware lucky draws. And on my previous trip to One Utama , the randy bangla behind the KFC counter handed me a free regular whipped potato made eligible from the scratch and sniff coupons.  To my delight this morning, I received a neat little consolation prize from an online contest - a Starlight Cinema double pass via e-mail. And to think that the Bananarama girls were just discussing about it during the dreary weekend. Hurrah! For once, I wouldn’t be tearing my hair out queueing for tickets at the TGVs or GSCs of Klang Valley.Visiting the cinema in the midst of a school holiday is bloody murder.Last Friday I was cornered onto the lap of 3rd floor Midvalley’s Ronald McDonald thanks to the long, multiple lines of people anticipating seats for the summer’s blockbusters.  p/s: to top it all off, the notorious Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam was a drag queen disaster waiting to happen.You  will have to see it(which I wouldn’t actually recommend) to understand what I mean.Some cheap script brought to the big,expensive screens.Very,very bad ending to a seemingly promising movie.  So here we go, a couple of frustrated filmgoers who would would rather watch movie re-runs under the stars rather than get killed at a riot for the sake of a useless flick.

       The Mirror Says Hi   The doppelganger has responded.  It’s like waiting for a satellite signal from lifeforms on Mars or something. Even Bovril was excited about us making contact. Took  Elmora  quite a good few days to digest the situation and react, I think we might share the mutual trait of communicative lag somewhere here.Only after the whole Foxy-has-an-evil-twin-commotion has simmered down did Elmora send me a friendly message on my mailbox,unlike the menacing psychopath's I had anticipated.I mean, I she could have been anything.But she was warm,fuzzy and wrote very eloquent English.  ".... my goodness! the resemblance is amazing! you and me... even our boyfriends! haha. thanks for messaging me... i really appreciate it! ..."  Phew.  My worst fear is to have an exact duplicate like myself running around on motorbikes, hanging out at Pertama Complex on weekends and dating a man with an uncertain ponytail growing out of his crew cut. Obviously she is  nothing  like that.Even though there are some things about us that are alike, she has quite a different yet unique personality; and a fetish for peculiar blythe dolls, whatever they seem to be. Moreover, she is far more interesting than silly old me.  (Frown).  ".... let’s add each other in our friend-networking list and see what happens ..."

       the twilight zone    Jebon and Tasha have the tendency to remind me time and again about how I resemble an obese version of the crooner Dayang Nurfaizah.The hell.The only thing we might have in common might be our skin colour and disastrous hairdos, I may say.My dad,on the other hand,tells me excitedly how proud he is to have a daughter who's a lot like his favourite ICI paint decor show compere cum Spanar Jaya Roseanne, Sandra Sodhy; though most of the time he's only poking fun at my protruding love handles.  Like the orang tua-tua saying,there are about 7 people in the entire universe that share our features, our looks and sometimes our personalities.Is that really true,I wonder? Because it had recently come across Petdiba's attention while browsing through her myspace network that she found the column of someone who looked  exactly  like me.Of course,after the shock  and  trauma of analysing the pictures Petdiba had reverted to me,I would say well yeah,we could have been sisters,or twins maybe in some other lifetime.  The similarities between us,I get-but the one between both our boyfriends?I don't.   urlLink Click here to be the judge of that.

      I read something interesting (and for once, related) a few days back.   The Quarterlife Crisis  - by source unknown -  “Our 20s and 30s should be the best years of our lives - so why do so many of us feel like we're going nowhere?    QLC - the  Quarterlife Crisis  will essentially replace the midlife crisis for our generation.It's taking us so long to get all that our parents complained about at the midlife,that once  we get pass some important points like school and a decent first job, we'll feel so relieved that I don't think we'll want to change anything. Psychologists are finally beginning to pay attention to this major life transition.Some are calling it Emerging Adulthood, others Prolonged Adolescence. Although the quarterlife crisis has always existed ... it is a more significant and prolonged process today, because of youngsters in their 20s and 30s' multiple job-hopping, delaying marriage and our responsibility to our families, just to name a couple of reasons.   Many young people are struck by the tyranny of the `shoulds' an inner battle over everything parents, teachers, friends, bosses, partners and authorities tell us we should do. People are made to believe that life should be a certain way  'I should have a high-status job, I should have a great harmonious relationship, I should be slim, sexy and have a high libido.' If something in our life  challenges these shoulds, it sends us into crisis.Hence they become afraid to resist the issue, and remain dormant in their little holes to hide, shying away from the society because they did not make it. Settling for something average is a comfort.  Often people get this 'deer trapped in the headlights' mentality where they feel like they can't move or can't say anything to their partner or close friends. I think a lot of the time they need to follow their instincts to avoid getting hit by the traffic.  We are blanked and confused with the purpose of our own existence."   -----------------  I suppose I could have the QLC disease. I will be 24 years old in four months. At the moment I have an administrative job that I sometimes hate, dealing with the job scope of an SPM-qualified clerk. Though it makes me happy in a sense that I don’t have to travel far or take the LRT to work and that the parking is free. Plus, I have my own PC, flexible hours, attractive benefits and a cubicle to myself I could snore in.Well that's about it; my wonderful and most enchanting career.   My conformity to my cocoon of the ordinary and safe was probably caused by the concurrent depression aggravated by failure re-inventing itself. Hell, I used to be quite an ambitious twit and believed that I would become an AD or CD of some sort.There were plenty of international names that I wanted to clip under my belt, I wanted to be one of the whos in the who’s who list. I wanted to fill up all the pages of my passport with stamps from many countries because I was important to everyone of them.So cheesily at one point, I was convinced that I had potential.  Bah!  My best bet is that it all started after graduation.My grades were fine,in fact better than I expected.Though it is a myth that I was special or popular with the lecturers simply because I did better (I studied, you fools!).The only one that favoured me was public enemy #1, so that vote didn't even qualify.Before school was out, there was the interview for class tutor I had attended with selected few classmates.The panel practically ignored my transcript and shortlisted the more `popular' and `happening' ones for the post.Like being really loud and annoying had any relevance to a fairly murni job of assisting an academician at the faculty (well maybe it had).I worked hard but like everybody else who did not kiss proper ass,apparently I was not the `inspiring-cool-cikgu' material unlike some.Which explains why my entry to the portfolio show had barely made it.Pathetic.  I thought of redeeming my self-worth when I got the job at the agency, but I didn’t make the cut. They were just using me for their own interests, there were just too much negative, abusive karma because I could not cope nor have I the capacity contribute.Then I tried branching out on my own,but to date I haven't seen a single cent from any my earnest undertakings.Nada.Zilch.Zero.I'd cry myself to bed like a sucker thinking about my own stupidity,  the girl who thought she could .  Now I am lost, but sort of calmed in my time warp; doing everything at my own pace.Spontaenity and passion in my head have long been dead.Only my romantic relationship has been a solid 2 years and maintaining its momentum.I care for my partner immensely,at the same time our lover's routine somewhat assures my humane role, almost like filling a requirement in a job interview form.As if it is compulsory to be attached to someone.It's good to cut to the soalan cepumas chase ”Dah ada boipren?” from sceptics who doubt the capability of a non-looker like myself to hook up with anybody at all.  I haven't shopped for 6 months.Absolutely nothing has turned me on the way I used to tear a shopping complex down before.My uniform is always my fisherman pants matched with a decaying tee and a formerly fashionable MNG slingbag.My two credit card debts are going through the roof, and it's ironic that I only use them when I am broke.I find that it is hard to not fall ill or gain weight when insurance and gym fees are expensive.I don’t fancy attending social calls as much anymore,its depressing to catch up with everyone else's going-ons when I have not gone anywhere.In fact,I am terrified at the whole idea of going out to see the world and let the world see me,an honest disappointment tilting the scales at whatever kgs it had last showed.I also have a hard time answering some general questions like : What is capoeira?What new mall's opened?What club's hip now?  My soul is dry.  I enjoy being shrouded in my oblivion.My only desires are staying at home on my favourite couch, eating my favourite BBQ Chachos-unbathed,unchanged and tuned in to AXN where I am at my most happiest.

      My double bonanza for the month of July is a 3 day 2 nights all-expense  self  paid trip for one&nbsp;to the south for some kuli work that included visits to region offices,&nbsp;organizing a series of drippy seminars&nbsp;and cup of brain damage.I  absolutely  loved it.   Road trips aren't always nice alone,so in my rush to pack up and leave&nbsp;my beloved homestate to go somewhere else, I packed Kayu and Petdiba the willing bums in my&nbsp;luggage as well.Oh the excitement!   One of my pitstops,however was more significant than the others.Coming back to a former `hometown' seem to have that effect on me, a little joyous; a little confused..a little sad perhaps.Things have changed,but there are also some other things that haven't changed.Though I've grown up and moved on,I don't think I will ever grow out of it.          Despite having driven around the city 2000 times before I still got lost.          Remember these,sucker?          Reflections of a greying fatso          That's a jukebox&nbsp;, idiot          KL wha-?...

             Happyhappyhappyhappyhappyhappyhappyhappy.          I&nbsp;do not like July because it rains a lot and one&nbsp;S.O.B. I used to care&nbsp;about was born a Leo.But today there are two reasons to celebrate.  Let's go&nbsp;by the top of my list.      No 1:  My job is secure.I am now a Telenincompooper.    Yeepidy freakin' yeay.    I have a staff number now that I don't have to rely&nbsp;on the stupid temporary card to come in every morning.I don't have to worry about applying my annual leave manually through the&nbsp;obnoxious clerk&nbsp;from the backroom or doing my appraisals on 14 handwritten sheets of loose paper or worry about my lodging claim entitlement that's only up to RM 180 or not getting caller ID on my personal extension. And hell I can ask for car loans,home loans, scholarships, stocks, commodities, whatever else the government can think of&nbsp;to offer.&nbsp;Lucky bastard, I.   So what's being bonded for eight years compared to that?         No 2:  Bebop + Foxy = 24 months    Withstanding manboobs and estrogen-laden moodswings have been daunting tasks.But I  did  it.I bruised my ego and learnt&nbsp;how to adapt to a sensitive man&nbsp;who drives a Kelisa  and &nbsp;an emotional rollercoaster.These past two years' experiences&nbsp;nurtured me into a woman who&nbsp;rid of&nbsp;her demon and understood how to accept another. Maybe realistic relationships tend to have that effect on you.   Happy Anniversary Bebop.     &nbsp;

      Saturdays&nbsp;make me&nbsp;Superwoman.Unlike the other days of the week, I get to acquire everything I've always&nbsp;put off&nbsp;at one go.Sometimes my errands take one whole day, sometimes&nbsp;as little as a 45 minutes'&nbsp;drive around the neighbourhood.Then again errands don't always make up my to-do list.It could also be the hurricane spring cleaning routine around the house or popping a video on the old VCR for&nbsp;a good old junkfood bingeing session.So the&nbsp;inventory goes on-the bills,the groceries,the VCDs,the tailor,the mess in my closet,the exorcism of&nbsp;junk in my car,getting on with a Yoga stance blahblahblah.  &nbsp;  To get the usual Saturday momentum goin on,I woke up yesterday around 9 am.I immediately scurried out of bed and got a notepad to lay out my&nbsp;money plans for the next 3 months thanks to the brief workshop I had attended at Adam's place the night before.Good stuff, I must say even though it was vaguely explained through&nbsp;a complicated&nbsp;rat race boardgame that was about  100 times better than&nbsp;Monopoly  (goddamn).Believe it.  &nbsp;  A bit later I got to watch Joy Luck Club and Casino&nbsp;on HBO&nbsp;I never got around to watching.They were both really good movies.I think it's my A.D.D that's cutting me out of my tv time,I hardly can concentrate enough on something to actually like it except for Malaysian Idol and AF where you could actually run off and take a piss or have&nbsp;dinner while the contestants make an ass out of themselves.By noon little nephew came by, so Y tu Mama and the sisters got him to roll over for the first time (yay!).Adik had persuaded me to cure my&nbsp;Bon Jovi&nbsp;shag at the salon with her, but I preferred to let it grow and send her off to get her cut.While waiting, her twin Kakak and I&nbsp;went speed shopping.Well  I  went speed shopping.I&nbsp;totally flipped when I saw&nbsp;that the blouses were going for as cheap as 20 bucks each and it all fitted,so I bought four.Financial freedom whatever.  &nbsp;  Later in the evening,came&nbsp;the long awaited trip to the notorious kelip-kelip habitat at  Kuala Selangor .It was one of those things I wanted&nbsp;to kidnap the twins to before they&nbsp;went back to their university hells in August,just a few hours out of boring old KL of too many One Utamas and Hartamases.I was confident it would be a short drive from home like what the&nbsp;guides had indicated, but we were cruising&nbsp;through looming estates and the Guthrie signboards just wouldn't stop popping up for one hour.Now I know why Shah my looney&nbsp;ex-roommate never liked to go home to Ijok.The roads were endless, lonely and lined with multiple Hindu temples that needless to say are disturbing.Nevertheless, our painstaking&nbsp;voyage was rewarded when we arrived at  Kampong Kuantan : the host to a majestic panorama of&nbsp;light illumination that went for at least a quarter of a mile down the Selangor river,with the stars adding a bit of drama to our&nbsp;showcase.We even got an extreme close up of the beautiful glowing fireflies&nbsp;a few times with the help of&nbsp;the elderly pakcik who with much machoism paddled our old school sampan like it was&nbsp;a gondola in Venice.          Bravo&nbsp;Pakcik.Bravo Mother Nature!   &nbsp;  It is pretty unfortunate that we cannot take any pictures because of the useless reflection the bugs may project to our flashes.Forgive this lame demo below, had to knick this from the website&nbsp;of somebone who had some supersonic-night-capture-lens- gadget thingamajig to let you see what I really mean.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Studio 54 by the     riverbank    &nbsp;   Again,&nbsp;the gruelling&nbsp;journey back brought us to the familiar hustle and bustle of&nbsp;Damansara life.We arrived back to civilization a little after 10, and&nbsp;thought we'd pop around Uptown to check out the usual jumble sales.Unfortunately the MPPJ trucks beat us to it and paralysed our desires for bundle tees&nbsp;and pirated DVDs.Somehow we wound up at my sister's place&nbsp;about a half hour later flipping through her collection and savouring the opportunity of&nbsp;a Sex and The City season 6 she had on.Samantha and her dyed pubes.Tsk.Tsk.When we finally got home at midnight, Crazy Chimp had taped AF, and the whole family stayed up till two in the morning to witness the tragedy of Rosmas of the world.Goodbye to Zarina and her non-existent career.  &nbsp;   Tv nerds.   &nbsp;  Of course, a late night won't be complete without a few episodes of Friends&nbsp;and two slices of Pizza.  &nbsp;  (Crawling back to bed tired on a well-spent Saturday is always a bliss).

           Being the drama queen that I am, I was so `distraught' yesterday I didn't realize I was walking around the office building with a dead fish and an armadillo-like stinky fruit in my bag.   It's nice to know that when colleagues go places, they remember you.My boss and the a makcik from two cubicles away&nbsp;snuck in a few souvenirs into my ranggi postman bag from their respective&nbsp;trips to Sarawak and Kelantan.So obviously ikan terubok and buah salak is the `thing' to get friends back home.  Here's to more weird gifts.       &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the curiously strong buah salak.  &nbsp;

        Still  anxiously waiting.   &nbsp;  Anyhow I have resigned to&nbsp;the probable fact that I might not be absorbed. Might not, might be, who knows. Though, funny thing is, it is making me feel a  little   lonely .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Suddenly I want Edduardo&nbsp;beside me and I don’t know why. I guess once in a blue moon it's good to have a sensitive male companion who can console and pat your head sexlessly when you most need it.&nbsp;   I feel like I am &nbsp;about to combust into flames and run off to&nbsp;my mothership at Kampung Kuantan (I heard the firefly colonies are just superb over there).By the way, I do owe the twins a getaway now that our road trip to Melaka is postponed;so the boatride down the Kuala Selangor river would have to do.Very Hanson,the twins and I.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I just checked my mail and found out I won yet  another  mug from the Around The World In 80 Days contest at GSC. One reason to smile for the day.And oooh,I've&nbsp;just learnt&nbsp;that&nbsp;I can now upload pictures on the blog without having to script it (another reason to smile).&nbsp;      I just don't know what the hell I am writing about.  &nbsp;  More irrelevant news,I've managed to spot&nbsp;Cik Tat who has somehow lost touch with the world,and sorely missed by everyone including my goodself after she started&nbsp;coordinating those creepy CT Fantasia nationwide tours (ack!).Talking about being photographed and posted up on a website without the knowledge of&nbsp;its subjects, I found a&nbsp;shot of her&nbsp;from a Tioman holiday cum party&nbsp;package site.Thought the titties looked familiar.    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      They said I was the luckiest of the lot. Pbbbffffttttt .  Today was supposed to be  my  day,yet I am not feeling so auspicious at all.In fact,I’m quite embarrassed that the elation about my permanent post appointment went a little overboard. I couldn’t help it that my boss is making me thank her for a `certain favour’ at the Thai Restaurant she’s always wanted to go to.Nor could I avoid the smarmy GM's secretary who is making things worse by convincing me it  is  going to happen.  Somehow I am having an anxiety attack that it wouldn’t.I’ve been having respiratory trouble these past two days thinking about it - the rumour concerning a certain politicking Senior Vice President who does not approve of my division’s structure, and my probationary status would extend if he doesn’t do anything about it.Bollocks,yeah?Then again, I could be wrong, and the sun will shine my way, and by the time I’m 25 I’d be able to buy property with my stable job.....sigh.I ridiculously fear all possible consequences that may kill those hopes.I hate hoping.Hoping never helps.  I made a few calls to rectify the situation.It just depresses me even more when the suspense that has been building up for the past six months was anti-climaxed by the stoned rempit in charge.  “Adik tungguuu aaaaa hari ni ke.Paling paling pun esok la..Kalau tak dapat tu takde aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.”  “Dia akan notify dekat mana?E-mail ke through secretary admin office saya?” I tried to level my voice.  “Awak ada e-mail ek?Ada la tu nanti.Kalau ada tu adaaaa laaa….pergi report duty.Kalau tak dapat tu buat cam biasa je lah ekkk.”  I don’t want to be a whiny little brat, but how do I “ Buat macam biasa ?”.I am hanging on a limb here, merely surviving on sausages packed from home everyday,waiting for my calling, waiting for the day I will be respected as a permanent member of the organization.Rewarded with benefits and priviliges that I deserve.Buat macam biasa,he says.  But there is only very much I can do.I guess nothing else left but to wait and pretend as if I couldn't care less.At least it beats hope.(Wish me luck though).

      For some reasons I’ve seen a total of four former classmates gross the pages of local newspapers under different, magnificent headlines this few months.Ahhh,the jealousy. I wonder what does it take for a person to be privileged enough to be highlighted as such.Is it good looks?A pair of huge breasts?Or does it need the loud, popular theatre girls that frequently made it to an outdoor music festival?  They are making me look a little underachieving.  There was one time though,I got to have my own iniquitous snapshot.It was a nightmare.If anyone has been to the first Cyberjayan `outdoor rave’ in `02, I was in a pair of flabbergasting short shorts that originally was my frail sister’s airy-pyjama boxers.I thought it was alright then, but thinking about it now, I would have fallen off a flight of stairs and knocked my head on the railing to have courageously flaunted that.   As if to haunt me forever one dickheaded photographer managed to capture the pitiful fashion moment and published it on an online `dance music’ site, with me nodding my head against the light trail looking as if I was on a motorbike with the wind blowing at 120kmph.Ooh.Not good. I remembered that all the `clubbers’ in the gallery looked superbly trance-funky except for my jiggling thighs and me.   It  had  to be a handsome friend who stumbled upon it before I could beg the webmasters to thrash the picture.  I did go back to the URL to check if it was still around (blush). Unlike some youth ambassadors, aspiring actresses, an example of a fashion Do and young socialites that know, my 15 minutes is up.Sorry Mr DeMille.  And thank you God.

      Getting the hang of this image uploading thingie.In my neverending adventure with The Stupids,I didn't know until a few days ago that I can mess up my blog here with pics.Tried to  a href  a few pics from an old blog that has the capability but eventually a banner came out and screamed `No Off-Site Linking!!’.Smart eh, these programmers.(I know this sounds lame but)Thanks Blogger dudes,you've made my day.  That being said,the shitty week was due to one reason and one reason only.My nymphet boss Jane Doe at it again, she and her disappearing tricks. I’ve had it up to my throat.The mountains of paperwork,the relentless phonecalls, the nail-biting decisions to make,her pesky students crawling over asking for dateline extensions...phew.Like WTF right?Then in the middle of all these hullabaloos,some HR guy flew in like a gallant messenger with a stack of evaluation forms,putting the work I had lined up to a halt.  The management wants my boss(es) to evaluate  my  performance.This is it.The lowdown on ye old Foxy.It's either I'm permanent or goodbye.Permanent.Or goodbye.        Concerning my being permanent-ized;Belly Man told me I'd have to wait until Jane came back to assess the situation because she  is  in fact my immediate superior that can gauge my 6 months' service of wiping her ass clean.Oh,we are both so bloody fake in front of each other.I can so imagine her writing things,but meaning something else.   Work Progress   Good Understanding of daily tasks and routines   My employee is a complete turd. She cannot tell filing from Filet-O-Fishes   Has initiative to improve quality of work  Updates blog regularly but not her weekly duties at the department   Effective time management  Spends a lot of time at the toilet for napping   Imbues a well-kept personality and potrays a clean image  Horrendous dresser with a tendency to wear shirts 3 sizes smaller   Able to prepare excellent paperwork  Business English resembles that of a 6 year-old    Fast learner  My blind cat thinks faster    I am pushing myself towards tomorrow’s long awaited LOTR I,II & III dusk till dawn movie marathon and grind my brains silly to prepare for the appraisal results next week.

      The midweek blues, if there’s such a thing, can really get to you. It’s such a slow crawl towards Saturday, and that’s not even a public holiday. Yesterday I was told my most unpopular and attention-seeking house cat Biggie murdered a huge rat and stuffed bits of it into my favourite pair of sandals. Yes, my favourite discoloured golden intertwined strappy god knows what in hell it was designed for anyway sandals.I was calm about it, but when I saw the mess I really felt like strangling the smug, adorable feline. From now on I must settle for my last remaining footwear, the dishevelled loafers Y tu Mama bought from Korea where the right shoe is ½ a size bigger than the left.Pretty much uncoordinated like my disastrous new  haircut ,a wild concoction of:   Scissors Gone Awry   1 tired ah moi hairdresser 8 oz minah rempit aura 3 oz super fluffy mullet ½ tsp of jinjang ahlian bangs 2 pints awesome 80s flashback  2 pcs of flippy Misz of the lame NTV7 programme Audition's horror `do for garnish   Method:  Blend at full speed and serve publicly. Makes gazillion humiliations. Voila!         Sigh. Nothing much I could do about it that the harm is done. I really should have heeded my own infamous salon tip #4: bring a picture , because naturally stylists at this level are vocabulary shy. I spent 45 minutes in front of the mirror trying to tame my damaged tresses with 15 bobby pins and the smallest gathering clip I could find. It slipped.I’ve already calculated that I’ve lost 25% of hair after that tragic hair colouring episode last December, and another 25% after the trim. Hence Barbie has more hair than I do at the moment.  Meanwhile, work = the desert.   Surprisingly I’ve been very productive and responsible to fill the void. I suppose that’s because Lilo the department cheerleader had gone for a two-week automation training, and it’s almost funny that I miss her irritating blurbs. Most of the staff from the division had split into various groups to serve  `communities’ in many remote parts of the country for some reason. In their absence, the office seemed much more of a hot and amorous place, for me at least.   Thanks to my irresistable Sunlife biscuits,Beejo my recurring crush has developed a larger derrière.Hurrah!

      Being deprived of Streamyx at home,here I am at the office backtracking the last 72 hours of my life (and other people's lives too)while my boss laughs hysterically at dirty Powerpoint jokes in the next cubicle.    Escorting Aimee to the Airport    A simple task that could have been simpler. Judging from average daily traffic that usually subsides after 6pm, I presumed leaving at 7pm would be suffice to reach KLIA by 7.30pm tops.(Bad buzzer sound).Wrong.The horror was getting stuck for half an hour at the four-corner junction in front of OU on a Friday evening; then having to wait for Bebop to shower, get dressed and powder his face for a full 20 minutes at  Serdang .We arrived with tyres a-blazing just in time to see Aimee kissy-wissy-huggy-wuggying her parents and disappear down the long, winding departure hall, feeling a little foolish that we didn’t have time to cry except for the migraines we got from all the running.  Well at least we managed to bump into Sir Edduardo the queer flight attendant in full uniform.(Cameras away!)     The Pants    I am now officially a hippo.  I came around a certain ladies’ department and was interested in a particular section of the floor that had marvellous pinstripe, linen and khaki pants going for as cheap as RM 30.So confidently I took some Ls to the fitting room.Hardly went through my thighs.Just trying my luck. I took an XL then.Still,pretty tight.The smirking promoter suggested an XXL, and as if it wasn’t insulting enough I had to try XXXL that still wouldn’t fit.Then there it was, my worst nightmare-an X1.  They had run out of Xs.     The End of an Era    If I weren’t overweight or sporting short hair I think would have made quite a sultry fortune-telling gypsy.Hah!Finally, the Euro 2004 thingie has passed us, and in all its glory Greece beat the Portuguese 1-0 last night.I could imagine a nation of grown men celebrating in togas, fern head wreaths and criss-crossed Spartan slippers while getting piss drunk on red wine from golden goblets. I kept reminding Bebop about my score predictions for the particular match, but being the stubborn jackass that he is, my far from knowledgeable football commentaries to him are like my occasional fashion police outcries; annoying. Not that I ever cared about 22 sweaty men chasing after a dumb checkerboard-printed ball, it just feels really good to know that my ill-researched goal prophecies were implausibly accurate during the quarterfinals; semis up to even the final game. So boo-hoo to you for losing out not listening to your woman’s yap and losing out on your silly RM5 winner’s pool.     Ragna-Rock    Besides my newfound footie-telepathy, one other incredible phenomenon unfolded in the streets of KL (in the aspects of traffic at least).It was a Saturday goddamit,the roads were mysteriously  super clear  when Bovril kidnapped Bebop and I to aide her quest for her guitar@rockstar superstardom at Kotaraya.  Anyway,Woh Fatt Pemborong Alat Muzik had an ambience that was of Abdul Wahub’s kedai muzit when we stepped in, the many young faces fiddling with the instruments, and the not-so-young children  in  us poking the strings and knocking on the bongos.I wouldn't be surprised if someone struck a familiar tune while the girls and the guys pair up together to dance to `Bunyi Gitar'.And the good karma continues.We stepped out with a hefty RM 98 discount and Bovril looking very McCready-ish with a shiny new Hofma strapped to her back in its snug cocoon thanks to Bebop’s most unlikely “connections”.  Coincidentally, Yahoo Launch is celebrating 50 years of rock n’ roll this week, commemorating the birth of Elvis, and all the Jimi Hendrixes and Jerry Cantrells of the world.   Definitely a  sign .

      From The Desk Of the Foxy Mama    1st July 2004   Tenant Management & Facilities Unit, Telenicompoop Malaysia Berhad, Somewhere Hilly and Infested with Rumah Setinggans and Motor Workshops.   Dear whomever it may concern,    RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDING FACILITIES   The above matter is referred.  In view of the restructuring exercise of our esteemed organization effective today, 1st July 2004, I would like to propose some helpful suggestions to better the currently mediocre status of building facilitation operations as to increase the current level of customer satisfaction as well as with delighting employees within the premises.  1.	As you may have acknowledged, there are insufficient settees that merely seats 5 people at the lobby area.The lobby is, after all a pseudonym for a lounge i.e a  resting   spot ;  waiting area .To my observation its breadth can accommodate at least 300 people, therefore the management should not compromise the comfort of capable furniture for those in need, especially during the weekly Lux/Pantene/Rejoice/Fashion Lady/Walls/miscellaneous promotion periods that would cause inevitable pedestrian traffic and riot of possessed makciks. I believe an additional sofa will mean a lot to all occupants and passers-by in this aspect, while also being a convenient stop when waiting for tardy colleagues for lunch, meeting up with bitchy clients, hanging out until the rain subsides, catching a quick nap during Friday prayers and other relevant matters that would offer maximum the usage of these fixtures.This way those affected would not have to loaf around in beneath the buntings or behind the ATM machine suggestion counter to relieve aching joints and muscles. And goddammit with all the extra LAN sockets and wires you dorks could at least set up a measly Internet kiosk or a TV to shut those screaming, bratty kids from the next door kindergarten up.   2.	Parking has now become a nuisance to employees such as myself.I have noticed that there are rows and rows of vacant parking lots around the basements, but it seems that the company drivers have been drunk enough to obstruct them with dozens of lorries and jeeps,leaving staff the uncomfortable choice of double, triple and sometimes quadruple-parking their vehicles.For this purpose we all understandingly release our handbrakes while our car is stationary as to expedite the multiple parking method.Though I admit makes me feel unbelievably Lindsay Wagner macho sometimes wheeling away a stranger's car to make my exit at the end of the day,I feel that this exercise may result in hazardous situations in the future.   3.	Moreover, I would like to also touch on the topic of  stupidity . Claiming our organization as the nation's `leading telecommunications company' must have been something the Chief Executive had muttered in his delirium combating dengue.For this so-called towering inferno that cost just a little more than Guatemala, our renowned telephony/dataservices/web providing giant failed to install the most critical tools for people who don’t reload their prepaids,pay their phone bills, charge their phones or don’t even have a mobile to their name. Phone booths .   As an initiative to the company’s brand new vision I hope that this letter will shed the light on why the company employees appear stressed and unproductive.So don’t blame us if we’re lazy, because we’re just pissed sometimes.  Your kind consideration is very much appreciated.  Thank you and best regards.     Foxy Mama  The Employee Who Will Always Have An Excuse Of Not Being Punctual

      Sleep is a precious commodity. I need at least 7 ½ hours of it, or I will be supercranky and over-the-top delirious. Last night I had dreamt of Fitri AF making a gay pass at me and tried to intoxicate me with poisonous food because apparently in that portal of surrealism I had a dick. I woke up every hour trying to brush it off, but the nightmare kept its sequence.  At the office today I tried to make a straight face, but unfortunately when I am groggy my double chin keeps showing and I'd look like a dastardly eggplant.  I swear I was hallucinating when I heard Sexy Clerk Boy (SCB) call me `comel’.  After discovering that my former object of affection Beejo possessed quite an EQ/IQ problem,I decided to change my motivation. In the many hours spent collecting printed materials at the back room, I realized that SCB who sat nearby the copier was pretty attractive regardless of his palpable moon crater complexion. He keeps excellent shape playing futsal and his horrendous Backstreet-Boy hair always wafted of marvelous scents.Minus the fact that he is a wise-cracking, cynical and tight-assed (literally) clerk, he was pretty much a tolerable eye candy at work.I would make excuses to photostat my IC to visit him everyday in spite of the regular fat jokes and makan lapan kali sehari punchlines he’d guffaw about to get on my nerves.  Sans obese gags,he is quite the wonderful company I never thought he would be.I’d cower behind his large desk often when I am pissed at my boss, or trying to escape a discussion, and he’d always ask me something at least: about me, my family, what I liked to do. And we’d talk like we’ve just met each other in a french café.Strange.  Sometimes he’d come to my table asking if I’d want to despatch anything or send documents to the 8th floor even if I never had the authority to do so. Come to think of it, he does that with me about 3 times a day and never to the others.  There were those times I’d sit here blogging and sensed that a pair of eyes was bearing a hole on my back. I’d turn to look, and there he is, staring at me, but he’ll eventually look away.But I guess I was just being perasan then.  After a while I noticed that during office buffets and makan free he’d pop around with a bowl of mihun or a plate of curry puff, handing it to me and saying ,”Nanti tak makan kang nangis.” Being the glutton that I naturally was,I'd wolf it down and wonder why he is being extra nice to me.  I sort of got my answer.I think.  This morning when asked if he would help me arrange the tables at the conference room, he had kindly obliged. And while doing so, I, still drowsy from my lack of slumber, offered to help him move the heavy objects.He quickly protested and waved me off.  “ Nanti hilang la comel kau tu kalau kau yang angkat ,”  I flustered. “Apa dia?”  Then he flustered.”Takde apa-apa,” he shrugged.Then he turned away,zits turning beet red.  “Cakap la apa dia,” I begged.  “Takde apa!” he roared, storming out the room, leaving me with two heavy tables still in disarray.  And since then,he’s been avoiding eye contact.  It’s been a while since I’ve had any love-unfolding drama. This could be exciting.And Bebop could also kill me.But this, can be exciting.

         All in all, I like the idea of rushing home to a vacation.  After the ardous Seremban-Malacca stint,I unpacked and loaded fresh summer clothes for my `weekend trip', one of those once-in-a-blue-moon-family-thingies where the twins are around and my dad gets all mushy and squishy and insist we have a getaway before they were gone again (slo-mo barf).Unfortunately I couldn't get my annual leave approved any earlier,so they left a day before I did.Bless me,the middle child.Arriving home and lonely (my deaf and senile grandma didn't help) from my gruelling drive I felt feverish.My legs were wobbly and I could hardly keep a bloodshot eye awake.Still,it was more than a thrill peeking at the bold red prints on my plane ticket that loudly read:    From Kuala Lumpur 0905 KUL 30 JUL To   Denpasar 1235 DPS    Then I passed out.  ------------------------  I woke up unusually late the next day, but not too late that I had time to mill around the terminal,empty my bowels and have healthy gigantic sets of Burger King meals with Bebop.Though annoyed with his constant nagging about keeping travel documents safe,luggage padlocked and blahblah;glad he saw me off.I was already as meek as a seaweed when the aerotrain came to gobble me up.  And oh,the surprise!The economy cabin were full(somehow it still remains a mystery  why ) and my seat, according to the pregnant stewardess at the boarding counter-was upgraded.   First Class all the way, baby .  Touching down at Ngurah Rai International Airport,I recovered fully from my ailment possibly due to the bottomless refills of orangey Vitamin C and a good nap on muffin crumbles all over my plush,retractable leather seat.   -----------------------------   The Javanese island of Bali stank of incense, joss sticks and  white people .I am not surprised that it was bombed before,it really did feel like a trailer park rather than an exotic South East Asian archipelago.Despite the invasion of sarong-clad Caucasians though,the cultural shows remained excellent, compared to the trashy beaches of topless women at `party central’ Kuta. In fact,I got rather addicted to the haunting gamelan tinkles that followed me wherever I went during my 3-day stay. The soothing music was in the lift, on the streets, in malls, on telly, in my hotel room, everywhere .I was disappointed that our hotel room doorbell sounded of annoying birds instead of the  bonang barung  or  slentem  I kept hearing.       Bonang-the goddamned noise I couldn't get out of my head     There was one particular attraction called the `Kecak Dance' that I thought was an unplugged choir of geniuses.It told a story about a ancient princess’s ordeal during her kidnapping by an ugly looking fat ass,where about 40 adults(men,mostly) gathered together flipping their tails and flapping their wings with dikir barat-like gestures while chanting `cak!' repeatedly but rhythmically to project emotions and actions throughout the one-hour performance  without a single dialogue nor melodic instrument .  Amazing what getting possessed can do to the human body.       And you thought these Indons were merely construction site stars     Infatuation for greasy altar boys in chequered pelikats aside,I sadly did not get to hang at the beach, or parasail or snorkel or look down glass-floored boats. People are thinking we are a bunch of loons for not doing so. But we didn’t even have time to pee at the rate we were going. We spent so much time together scouring craft villages and decorative souvenirs and shoo-ing persistent hawkers that don’t understand “Nggak mau beli itu” or “aku tak nak la bongok!”. It was fun,actually,I have to secretly admit.I helped my dad,the quiet, conservative one pick out a painting, and it was then I realized that we have quite the similar inventive taste.For RM 80 a discerningly done masterpiece could be yours at Ubud,one of Bali’s most prominent `pasar seni’.The next few days saw us visiting more gigantic penis woodcarvings, a dead volcano that smelled a lot like Genting, markets full of sarongs and beaded slippers.When I left KL,I only had RM 100 to last my next paycheck, so I could only settle for minimal trinkets for myself. Getting keepsakes for friends and family seemed pointless however. Out of the many places we ventured to, there were hardly any keychains or kitchen magnets. (Gasp).The tourism irony of it all.  So I had to settle for coin purses, for people who already have purses and coins.  Of course, a retreat to a neighbouring country wouldn’t be complete without a visit to the rumah urut. Y tu Mama ,Cranky Chimp and I we were assigned to our own sleazy massage cubicles that looked a lot like booths at a prostitutional harem.My timid,blonde-haired masseuse gently told me to take off my bra and put on a pair of disposable panties. I hesitated; then again I had no choice since it was going to be greasy with the oil and all.Uncomfortably lying on the massage board with a sarong securing my embarrassing bits,I waited for her to begin the treatment with a clenched fist and my eyes closed.  She came in, grabbed the cloth from my torso, started waving it around like a matador and tried to massage my breasts.    .   I have no recollection whatsoever of what happened after she grabbed my right shoulder to stop me from screaming.  ------------------  Then after a cup of garlic tea,speedy windowshopping and some culture shocks later, I was already on my way home, a few hours from Damansara, few more hours away from work on a Monday.  Sigh .(Like I said, I didn’t even have enough time to pee).
