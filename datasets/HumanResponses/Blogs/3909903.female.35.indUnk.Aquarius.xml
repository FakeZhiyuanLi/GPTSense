      It is so weird to live in a desert, coming from New England.  I am used to 2 types of people; fan people and air conditioner people.  It is truly unfortunate when the two types marry each other.  In May when it got to be 75 degrees with 90% humidity, Mark would try to sneak the air conditioning unit into the window frame.  Not an easy or quiet job.  My point would always be if we are cold 9 months out of the year, why do I have to wear socks to bed in August when we can just use a fan.  Mark, being from warm climates, wanted to know why we would blow hot, humid air around the house when we could have air conditioning. I think it goes back to my childhood, when the seasons were true seasons.  There are definite memories of summer.  The sound of the shades getting sucked into the open window frame, wearing just underwear to bed, and waking up chilly with dew on the ground.  I still remember taking naps to the sound of the heat bugs.  We played in the sprinklers and made mud holes to lie in.  (My father hated that.) The only place that had air conditioning was the library.  We used to walk 2 miles just to hang out there and read.  They had fans going as well, and I can still remember the loud sound of it in the quietness. It cracks me up that we then had to walk 2 miles home again in the heat holding library books with plastic covers sticking to our arms. I think the church had the same fans as the library.  They almost drowned out the priest.  The best thing about Mass in the summer was that it was usually quicker.  Or maybe the time passed faster when we made accordion pleats in our bulletins to fan ourselves.  Of coarse we had fancy, uncomfortable church clothes on that itched when we sweat. The highlight of the summer was the swimming lessons.  Boy, was it hot walking to the community pool, but coming home with wet hair felt wonderful.  I used to play a game with my sister and my best friend, if we had money for an ice cream, what flavor would we get?  I think the last day of swimming lessons we got to get one. I think that is what made summer seem so long.  It was a long, hot summer.  Now it seems to go so fast because we actually sleep at night and eat real dinners.  During the summer it was too hot for my mother to use the oven and we had a lot of great light meals and salads.  Last night I made chicken and dumpling.  What a weird world this is. I made Zoe walk to the library with me this morning because it was only 104.  If you live in a desert climate, you understand that this is totally do-able.  She complained the entire way and kept informing me that it was hot.  I told her to be quiet so she could hear the heat bugs.  She said they were telling her it was hot. Our apartment faces North and South in the shade, so I don't have to turn on that dreaded AC until late afternoon.  I put the 2 kids down for naps at 2:30 and Zoe asked me to lay down with her.  I asked her if she wanted to wear just her panties, and as I curled up behind her sweaty back, I could smell the heat in her hair.  It was delicious. As soon as they were asleep I got up and put on the AC.  I think I will make a salad for dinner, just to remind myself it really is summer.  Then I will wear my socks to bed.

      Since I have moved to a whole new coast, I have had to start all over making friends.&nbsp; I think I underestimated this.&nbsp; I am shocked to feel like I am dating all over again. I have met a lot of women, but few really click.&nbsp; Some are nice, but I doubt I will call them again. The problems start when the feelings aren't mutual, and is often awkward.&nbsp; She will call me on a regular basis and assume we are going to see each other often.&nbsp; I find myself screening my calls and giving empty promises of "next week-sure!" When they find out I have still been looking for more friends they are hurt and want to know when they can come, too.&nbsp; I find myself hiding new friends and activities from them, because I don't like them enough to be responsible for their good time. I find my criteria changing for friends.&nbsp; I do have age preferences, which have defiantly gone up with my age.&nbsp; I have found some women too needy, too clingy, too young, and too shallow. Then I met HER.&nbsp; She was "the" one, I was sure of it.&nbsp; She is has lived on the east coast, is pretty, in shape, has the same interests and kids the same age.&nbsp; We are perfect together!&nbsp; But she&nbsp;is seeing &nbsp;other friends. &nbsp;She said they didn't mean&nbsp;much to her, and even made fun of them.&nbsp; I told her she was the first&nbsp;person in Vegas I liked.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believed her when she said our families should get together that weekend and waited for the phone.&nbsp; I sat depressed that night, watching COPS. Aha, I thought, I knew she said she had an appointment on Thursday.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;call&nbsp;her and offer to take her girls!&nbsp; She said she was sorry fro not calling me for so long, and she seemed to have totally forgotten about Saturday.&nbsp; I guess old habits die hard.&nbsp; It's ok if she uses me, as long as I get to see her.&nbsp; I must find a way into her world. She was very grateful and said they will come early and visit before she had to go.&nbsp; Then when I called Thursday morning to confirm, she said her younger daughter had a bug.&nbsp; Hmmmmmm....Was it the truth?&nbsp; I played the message over and over and decided for my own sanity she was for real.&nbsp; We are supposed to go out next Tuesday night and she was going to call yesterday for the kids to get together.&nbsp; That hasn't happened yet, but I think this friendship is going to be worth the trouble. In the meantime, I am not sure what to do with the other ones.&nbsp; Is it leading them on that I will visit with them now, but leave when I get other friends?&nbsp; I guess it doesn't do any harm to have meaningless cups of coffee.&nbsp; It's interesting at the time, even if they can sometimes leave you empty and lonely in the morning.

      I miss Melrose Place.  Namely Heather Locklear, AKA Amanda, the ultimate villain.  Monday night was the highlight of my week, nothing could tear me away during that hour.  Even Mark got sucked into it.  When he was away for work he made up an excuse to get out of Monday Night Football and snuck into his room for his guilty pleasure.  I admired Amanda for never looking back after she demolished someone.  I am always second guessing myself, being so afraid of offending someone.  Not Amanda.  She thought it was a sign of weakness. When I was little my favorite Disney character was the evil queen from Sleeping Beauty.  She was fabulous; both beautiful and powerful.  The fact that she could turn herself into a dragon fascinated me to no end.  I actually felt sorry for her when she died because she pushed it a little too far.  There is a fine line to be watched. When Kristin was forced into my life I found the perfect villain in flesh and blood.  This girl is pure nasty.  It was so much fun to dislike her!  She always started off the conversation nicely enough, then as soon as I had my guard down, wham!  She would zing me.  It is so shocking to have somebody truly rude to you that it leaves you stunned.  I would stay up at night thinking of things I could say back to have the upper hand.  The rivalry was thrilling.  The feud was taking shape. I would love to ask anybody casually, "Have you talked to Kristin", because I knew there was an outrageous story coming.  She was such a bitch.  I didn't know one person who liked her, including her family.  I would call her just to be outraged.  I loved to tango with her and everybody I knew waited to hear the latest Kristin story, and they were never disappointed. Then all the fun was over.  I found out she didn't dislike me at all, as a matter of fact, if she had an opinion of me it would lean towards favorable.  Who knew?  She didn't think of all of these mean things to say ahead of time.  Now I can't look like the bigger person and make the peace because there was no feud.  That bitch. Then it got worse.  I found out the reason she put every person she ever met down was because she is insecure and needs to boost herself up.  Damn.  Now I feel sorry for her. I realize now I don't have to say a bad word about her, she is guaranteed to put her foot in her mouth every time she speaks.  There is absolutely no fun in that at all. My favorite character in Days Of Our Lives, Sammy, is now threatening to turn good.  I was glad she had a terrible temper tantrum Friday and caused a huge scene because I need to live through somebody.
