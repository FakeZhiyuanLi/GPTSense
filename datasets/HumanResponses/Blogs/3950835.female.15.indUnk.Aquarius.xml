       In the last two nights we've manged to steal some horses and we got them to get us about 60 miles away from Klamath. But at that point we ran into another group of greys.&nbsp; During the fight between them and us all but one of the horses died... it was sad. Ryu lived tho.&nbsp; Also during this fight Caden gets a really bad wound at first we almost killed him because we thought it was inflicted by one of the greys. But right be for Red almost shot him Amaya ( bless her soul) saw a tree close by with one of its low hanging branches covered in blood. turns out during the fight he had been pushed into the tree and the dead branch had gone into his shoulder. Even though&nbsp;Red didn't shoot him ( to Red disapointment the two of them dont get along well) Caden still lost a lot of blood. He past out after about on hour of walking so we had to set up camp in the middle of no where in the freezing mountains while the rain was pooring down. ( which at points in this place can be toxic) so most of us were soaking wet and all of us including Ryu( the horse) had to fit into a quite crowded shelter. I had to clean and stitch Caden up.&nbsp; Which was quite grusome normaly I like blood but not his and it kept flowing and I'm not to handy with a needly. We had to stay in that spot for two more days waiting for Caden to heal enough and build up his blood supply which took for ever. Then we were moving again towards Klamath. I dont know whats waiting there but I know we need to get there. So we're on foot in the middle of no where in the end of this part.

      I keep having this dream over and over.&nbsp; In my dream the world has ended... I think. Every thing is dead. Above ground you hear nothing no birds no animals no breeze. The trees are all dead the ground is black as coal you can travle for miles with out seeing another living soul. In my dream I am with a goup of seven people&nbsp;RNBAJJC are the first initals of each. I think that we are the last survivors in the town. Its really interesting nothing mechanical will work. Theres no electrisity at all. And every thing is quiet for days that is until Josh makes the mistake of playing with Reds gun and firing it. Then we find out that the town has gone to hell. There is a disease that has affected almost every one in the town... there are still about 50 normal people in the town not counting us. The disease that is spreading we came to call the grey.&nbsp; If a person gets the grey there skin turns...who could guess ...grey. the grey affects people by slowly making them deteriorate while there still alive its like a worse and faster spreading leprosy. The person affected most likly always is driven insane by the pain so it goes after other people blaming them for the pain it feels. This isnt like the living dead thing all these people all still living and believe me they do die.&nbsp; Butt any ways the grey spreads by open wounds scratches, bites, and so on. So after Josh fires Reds dame gun the things swarm in attacking us and each other. We have to fight our way out there slashing, blood, death and the like. Amaya almost gets her head taken off bye Reds firing the damn gun. Bubbles which we so love calling him doesnt know wow to fight worth&nbsp;shit but gives a go with the daggers.&nbsp; He almost cut up him self as badly as he got the greys. Caden killed some major peple as did red. I got about five of them. Amaya got three, Justin got 10, and the ran off. After we got over the shock of almost dying.&nbsp; We yelled at Josh for three hours. Not only did he bring all the attention to us but he hid behind a car the hole time we had to fight...I mean even Bubbles fought and hes a peace lover.&nbsp; We were in some small town by the coast Sea side or New Port probably. We were working on making our way back to Klamath Falls. The dream continues each time&nbsp;I have it so I'll write more latter.

       Yesterday&nbsp;I went to Arias and had a blast desicusing shifter animals, the end of the world, and the like. Aria I love you! any ways today I had to get up at the oh so early hour of 7 a.m.&nbsp; For me being my nocturnal self that was an extreme pain concidering that I had just got to sleep. Then I had to get in a car for two hours to go to mount Hood with the family ( which means me , mom, exchange student,&nbsp;a 45 year old,&nbsp;her 6 kids all under the age of ten mind you) it was horrid...until I ran and went horse back riding the horse I got was absolutly beautiful. His name was Ryu he was black with a redish brown streak down his face. Got could he go fast.&nbsp; That was the high light of my day the down pint was it was sunny and there were the kids...I'm never having any. I absolutly hate the sun. I have an extreme sensitivity to bright light, I burn is seconds and I just hate it when its sunny. The sun increases the teperature wich make every body agrivated and they all start yelling at there insane little children who they made the mistake of bringing to a packed restuarant that has no air conditioning after a horrid day at a packed ammusment park and there little kid is screaming at the top of there lungs " mommy I want so ice cream, mommy get me some Ice cream! please mommy please let me have the ice cream, no i dont want to eat the chicken, Mommy I want ice cream! you said I could have ice cream get me some Ice cream!" they contiue on for the next twenty minutes unitl you think that your head is going to explode. Then the parents give in get there brat some Ice cream and when you finaly think that you'll have some peace the little kid that was screaming is now turned around in the both in front of you starring and making faces...which your not aloud to make back so you have to leave... back into the heat...not that it would make much differance from the resteraunt with no air. Then you get in your car start back home and realize that your air isnt working so you have to roll down your windows which makes it so you cant hear your music but you can hear the snide comments and whistles comming from the drunk truckers that pass you...this is why I hate the sun.

       Its is my belief that certain people have the abilty to shape shift mostly in the AP but some on this earth. A shifter can be some one who can change there body shape or features to match those of an other or a being that can shift into an animal or from animal to human... were-beasts of such. About lets say 20% of the worlds population can shift that may not seem like a lot but in truth its millions of people.&nbsp; Shifters tend to be drawn to one an other so if you know one shifter that person probably knows at least 5 more.&nbsp; Animal shifters come in all types of spieces the most widly known is A were- wolf. Known to few as there real clasification Garu. A Garu is a wolf or kanine shifter. Wolf shifters are among the most popularly known because they rank at 50% of the shifter population. other types are much more less known. Wolfs rang in many different types so no Garu shifter is a like. then there are Felis the feline shifters these rang from jungle cats to house cats. There are also Hehdreu ( Bear),&nbsp; Calis ( horse), and many many more. Shifter blood&nbsp;can be and often times is a family trait if you have one Garu then most in likely he/she with have one or more family members who show the traits also.&nbsp;Many of you might think the notion crazy but after all the stories and legends past around in all parts of the world why should it be so far fetched? You yourself probably know some one who shows a&nbsp;very strong&nbsp;likliness to a certain animal. Who are you to say that there not shifters. Native Americans dress as animals that they thought sacred and some even claimed to have invoked the spirit of an animal. Who are you to say that they didn't. In this world there is so much going on that you have no idea about. I&nbsp;just gave you one.

      I love tattoos and all body art for the matter and I am in fact getting one soon. but you want to know what really agrivates me...probably not but you'll be hearing it any ways. Ditzy blondes who go get pointless tattoos just because they can that have no personal meaning what so ever... tattoos and body art are means of self expression of letting people know who you are. You shouldn't go ink yourself because you think it looks cool. Its a completly idiotic thing to do and your going to hate it when you get older. A tatto should have a deep meaning to you... like some&nbsp; Native Americans get there spirit animal or tribal tattoos those have meaning... Celts fet knotted symbols or there history on there skin thats meaningful if your going to get inked get some thing that shows you not some one else and not because you think a certain design looks good at the time. As for body piercing just make sure you really want it make sure you wont regret it and make sure the place is clean and uses the right tools.

        Vampires have always held a certain interest of mine. There so dark and seductive. I've always been attracted to them and the like... not to mention I find the whole drinking blood thing extremly sexy. There are so many different stories behind vampires that your never sure you've got the right one. Do there hearts beat? Can the live in the sun? Do they sleep in coffins? Is that because they have to or is it more of a fetish? Do they Feel? I have a some what Vampiric friend but he's an AP vampire...most of you dont know what the AP is so disreguard that comment. He can be in the sun, I'm pretty sure he doesnt sleep in a coffin,&nbsp;But&nbsp;I havent really been close enough to see wether or not his heart beats. He claims not to feel, but I've felt him feel anger, lust, and in points extreme longing and I know at one point in time he felt love. I find him extremly sexy but then again I find any thing dark extremly sexy so I dont really count on anything. Most people dont belive in Vampires. But there so many wide spread stories of them that at least one of them has to be real.&nbsp;Like the Incubi... God that wouldn't be a bad way to&nbsp;die. They are male vampires that feed off of sexual energy...tasty. And&nbsp;theres so many others. I dont really no the point to this blog except this is what I thought about when I woke up this morning...anlong with I feel liker watching the disney movie Anistasa...I dont think&nbsp;i spelt that right...  &nbsp;

       Today I was sick every time I stood I got dizzy. It sucked but it was kind of cool to see the floor hit the ceiling the way it did. If death is caused by feeling would sickness be to. Or could sickness all in your head. If you gave a cancer patient a bottle of sugar pills and said that it was a new cure, if they took it would the cancer recede? test show that in a lot of cases sickness in more in the mind that in the body. If some one wached a show on cancer and kept think about it 24/7 there mind starts to give the body symptoms of the dicease and some times the cancer it self. So is sickness just in the mind? Do thoughts kill you? If all your life you thought you were immortal, would you live forever?

        I believe that every person has their own element and some have mixed but very few.&nbsp; There are six    elements   earth  ,   Air  ,   Fire  ,   Water   ,   Shadows   ,   and   Light  . Each appears in the aura as the color it is high lighted in. Shadows is actually ruled by black but that color does not show up in auras so when seen in an aura it is perple. People with certain elements or mixes of the elements have certain traits and are some times drawn to there element but not always. For instance I am a Blue and Im a complete and total Pyro. So your not always drawn or limited to your element.&nbsp; A mix of all elements would be extremly powerful or a group of 6 people each person having said elements. There are only about 100 people in the world who have a complete mix of all the elements and out of the only 5 know it. People with all elements some times tend to be some what off and atleast 40 of the 100 will end up in an institution dabbling with all six elements can be dangerous if you dont know what your doing so please be carful if you try to do some thing with all six of them.

       Today we went on a six and 1/2 mile Hike yeah its not that far got a good work out though three miles of it was up hill. We saw some absolutly amazing waterfalls they were so beautiful I miss them already I wish I had brought more film.&nbsp; I love water its my element I would live in it if&nbsp;I could. It calms my mind and sooths my soul. I love the rain I could stay out in it all day. The rain speaks to me in a way most cant understand my life in this town is just waiting for the rain to come again so I can be alive again so I can feel what I want to feel. Water washes away all of my problems and makes me forget most of my pain its my life. I dont think I could live with out it.

      There is some thing that states that in the end its feelings that kill you. You age because you feel and in the end they kill you off. This got me to thinking If that were true If you could live with out feeling would you live for ever.&nbsp; And if it were would it be worth living in immortality if you could never feel true happiness or love sorrow or pain. I have a friend who says that he feels nothing and at most times I believe that its true he could murder his parents his best friends and not give a damn. Me I'm an empath I live my life threw the feelings of others and at times become so over whelmed with them that I cant feel my own feelings. So if he were to feel nothing and I were to feel everything He should live for ever and I should have to die young but which would be better living with so much feeling or never feeling at all?

       Every one some where know some one whos a cutter or a carver or in the like and many of them think theres some thing wrong with there friends families or just random people they know. Now if its a dangerous thing like they contimplate killing them selves your worring is understandable tell some one before its to late but others the ones who have reason and dont plan on killing them selves listen to there explination. Some cutter do there Cutting because they want to make sure there still a live others do it as relief from one emotion that gets to built up and letting it out could be dangerous. Carvers they do it for the design the cut in patterns across there skin are there art there personality. people who think that these type of people are in need of help are mostly wrong. cutting or carving in a none dangerous way is the same as getting a tattoo a mark to show who you are. You would not degrade some one for tattooing nore recomend them to shrienk so why go balistic when some you know does it. its there buissness there art there person and they like it. If your friend is unstable and your sure of it then sure get them help but if its a sign of expression leave them be are ask them about it but do not assume that there loons. I'm a carver a see certain images in my mind and after a while I get tired of seeing them over and over so I carve them into my skin there my art I'm my canvase I'm no danger to my self and I'm a completly functional Individual I dont contimplate death or suicide I'M not insane...on most days and I'm perfectly happy

      As I was sitting and doing nothing...which i am often doing I started think about Goths...&nbsp; and some of there anti-conformaty Stuff (&nbsp;I cant spell worth shit). A lot of goths hate conformaty and groups so they all hang around talking about not joining a group and not conforming to any thing but technically if you sitting in a group were every one is talking and thinking the same way havent you actually joined and conformed to a group of anti-conformaty GOD people why do you have to be so counterdicting ...confusion Note I have nothing against goths and I happen to like there darkness and style

       What can I say I love them... some times to much though. Lets see In the last month and seven days I think I've fallen in and out of love with ... Six guys...its bad first it was Josh then it was Theo...(if you a friend not the one your thinking of), then Richie, after him Drew, next was Justin ( god did he have a nice body) then Lloyd ( he's still sexy)&nbsp;... I like to many of them and I can say that at least three of those guys were seriously wrong for me if not dangerous...the sexy ones always are. Maybe I should go lesbian?... * thinks on it*... nope to atracted to males.. though I have to Admit Broody from the Distilers is Sexy. Any ways ... I really have to lay off the males so I'll try...damn hornyness!

       I'm seeing this poem over and over in my dreams it shows up on walls, mirrors, bed posts its wierd so here it is if any of you have heard of it e-mail me I'd like to know where I'm getting it from.   Its called Silent Night    &nbsp;  Silent night, darkest night   Penetrating feelings of lost hope   and solitude   Sullen Night, Faded Light   Darkness consumes me   Reaching for&nbsp; hope    Grasping for sanity   Comming up empty   Alone   forgotten   and ashamed   Terrible night, Bound in Flight   in which darknes consumes me   Nothing is left, nothing to live for   so I die alone in vain

       Sorry I havnt writen in so long... I've been hella busy.  Partying and such. I've still been having extrmly simular dreams but as of late a new person has entered them. I first saw him two nights ago.  After Caden had healed enough to be up and moving again we desided we'd travle during the night to be less noticable. As we were travling threw a wood we came across his body... We thought he was dead but as we moved past him a groan from the body made us turn back.  We werent sure if he was dead or a gray... We had to move around him catiously. You cant be sure if a person is a gray unless you can see there skin... grays still have intelegence and emotion but mostly the emotions they feel are hatred and loathing for other human beings... So it being to dark to see him clearly we didnt exactly rush forward to help him.  Justin lit up a lantern and moved closer to the body very slowly. The person was lying on his stomache so we could not tell if he had many injuries. As Justin moved closer we could see that the person was not a gray.  When he was about 4 feet away from the body the person lept to his feet and fell into a fighting stance. His dark eyes were filled with rage and pain. His close were in tatters and his shirt was barely there. threw the torn material I could see three deep slash marks across his chest and one across his upper thight. he was still bleeding badly.Justin tried to talk to him and calm him down. That didnt work to well.  The man had pulled a dagger out of his belt and threw it at Justin. Luckily it missed him... Unluckily it hit my horse. It wasnt a mortal blow but it was enough to cause a lot of pain. I got extremly angery and started yelling at the new person. He responded by calming down and passing out. Red moved in and tied his arm behind his back then threw him on the back of the horse. We travled about an hour more until we found a clearing. After we set up camp I went to work on Fixing up the new comers wounds..unlucky for me he came to during the middle of the procidure and tried to fight his way up. He reopened all of the wounds I had stitched closed. I had to Have Red and Justin hold him down for about two hours so I could stitch up all of his numorous wounds. by the time I had finished he had calmed down and stayed put when Red and Justin released him. We had some one stand gaurd over him the whole night just incase any thing happened. Over the next few days he became a little more Friendly. I've desided his name id Matthew. He doesnt talk to much. So far in three days I've only heard him say "thank you" and "here" He's become quite helpful I just wish I knew more about him.
