      Even bigger than Woodstock - we're all set for Coventry Festival Aug 13-14 in Vermont. Should be a life changing event. Don Vito is on board with Lufkin and Lobron - RV arrangements need to be made asap. And when I say made - I mean Lobron - get your Credit Card out and rent us an RV bonus boy.   Can someone provide me with examples where a band of the magnitude of Phish had a farewell concert tour that culminated with a huge 2-day festival? Is this unprecedented? Am I overstating the significance of this event?   No. It will be life changing.   Last post before my Cross Country flight to San Fran tomorrow. I figured I'd state that I'm fully expecting it to be hijacked by a team of Arab hooligans. That way if it happens it would be historic that I documented it here a day before -- and I've never done anything historic in my life.  I just saved my life.

      As of today, I am strangely detached from the reality  of the news. But I want to pass something along for  those who may need it: the ability to feel what I  attempt to describe below in the final sentences of  this writing - if indeed, you are one of the fortunate  and can feel it - will never leave, and will never  become any less vivid.   I have a different persective than many of you - what  is happening to you today happend to me, in a  different form, in August of 1995, when Jerry died.  The pain subsides, new routines and musical fixes are  found, some family stays with you and some does not -  but I am here to tell you that the detail never  leaves. On most Phish nights, when the lights dimmed,  I always had my eyes closed, and was again watching  Jerry walk out. Those stolen moments were never sad,  but always ecstatic for me. The energy, and the  passion never fade. The love never dims. The lessons  become clearer, and the music even sweeter. You'll  see. In decades to come, the little trick I try to use  below, at the end of this self indulgence, will work  just as well . . .   Regarding Phish: You've gotten what you paid for. And  you got off cheap.   Regardless of how much you paid - to Phish Inc.  directly, to the scene, in your relationships, with  your health or soul - you're in on the bargain of the  century. You bought the stock at .01 a share, and have  sold it at 1,000.00 per. Perhaps you don't know this .  . .   Now, the incidental fringe benefits are not to be  overlooked, nor disrespected: friends, lovers,  spouses, self-knowledge, expanded compassion, honed  capitalist skills, an amazing cd collection, travel,  adversity defeats and victories, maturation, blessed  emotional retarding to the joyous child-like levels,  and of course, lots and lots and lots of really  freakin' amazing music.   But. Allow me to remind you of the Great Intangible.  Of the Priceless Gift that you perhaps weren't even  aware you'd received - of the Holy (in all that that  word evokes for you) Unarticulable: The Magic.   I cannot describe it. I cannot relate it to a  particular show, or to my or your favorite YEM or Tube  or Divided Sky. It is beyond definition, beyond grasp,  beyond description, and beyond value. But not - never  ever ever - beyond perception. Here it is:   It is preceeded by that moment, as you wait for the  lights to go down - you know it will be any second  now, and its killing you in the bestest possible way,  as if you were 6 years old at 5am on Christmas Morn -  and the earthly realm and its horribly heavy (and  light) luggage are about to melt away, completely. In  what surely is the most tremendous understatement in  the history of human language, you consciously or  unconsciously feel and think: "All is right. There is  no where in the universe I would rather be right now."   Then, the Great Inarticulable - you can hear it RIGHT  NOW, as loud as if you were in the moment, as real as  its ever been, capable of literally raising the hair  on the back of your neck, and hardening your nipples,  at *this very second*. See if you got what you paid  for all these years, and then some. Right now, quiet  your head for a second, close your eyes, and imagine:   The lights go down. The crowds roars, to the point of  physical and aural immersion, and the energy - The  Magic - fills your very DNA.   Did you hear it? If you're one of the lucky ones, The  Magic resonates so clearly in memory that it is as  real for you at your desk right now that it ever was  in any venue you've visited. And if so, you got so  much more than you ever bargained for. Congratulations  on your fine, fine, unintended purchase. It carries a  lifetime satisfaction guaranteed warranty.   Grateful,  -p.

      Down with Disease (Phish)  "This has all been wonderful, and now I'm on my way..."  Trey's guitar riff at the ending jam is one of the best musical moments I've ever heard. Point Blank (for lobie).   What a week! Phish breaking up! I won't pretend to be a huge phan, but I am definitely more than a casual listener. What a turn of events, but maybe it's for the best. More TAB tours can't be bad.  Article of the day:   http://www.phishhook.org/board/viewtopic.php?t=386726&sid=45bf6ccb108b4ed152ab5ee2b9ecc625  Even for non-Phish music diehards - good points on what it's like to follow a band so intently year after year. Long read though and it reads like Corky Thatcher wrote it.

      This is just a place for me to get my prolific thoughts and genius ideas down on record, before someone else claims them as their own.   I'll try to update it regularly for the 2 people that will probably read it(Hi mom and dad!).  Expect diatribes on music, the war on terror, and Red Sox baseball.   Don't expect anything that hasn't been said 100 times already.    Thanksdf (for luf)

      Excerpt from a short story I'm working on...let me know if you are interested in reading the rest ka;ljsdf Hell i'll post it eventually   "Are you ready?"   "Yes."   And with that, the two travellers were off to their ultimate destination. Covering nearly 1,000 miles in 2 days was part of the plan, part of the angle -- but they were still exhausted and silently fearful of the mission that lay immediately ahead.   The two men did not talk as they hiked the remaining mile that led to The Banker's cabin. Totally fucking random. That was the point wasn't it? That was what they were there for - the sheer chaotic and random nature of this whole pyschotic plan.   The rocky terrain was no match for the adrenaline filled crew of two that ascended towards the base of the Cascadian hill. The taller man found the whole thing rather humorous. The paler, thinner one was scared shitless.   "There is no turning back", thought the meeker one. "He would kill me first. I know he would."   They approached a small wooden cabin at the corner of about an acre of flat land - the only flat land they had seen for miles.   The taller one pulled out a large hunting knife, waited for his companion to catch his breath, and then knocked on the weathered wooden door. They both waited...   To be continued...?

      Human relationships are fucking baffling to me. How is it normal to talk to someone multiple times a day EVERYDAY for a year and a half and then just STOP. No contact, nothing. And yet it feels completely normal and fine.   That is amazing to me. I'll never understand it -- but I love it.   Sitting here making Cold Calls this morning -- RECCOOOOOO! Tough times...

      I need to start wearing my collar up and being an asshole. It's a radical new approach to chicks, but it's one that I haven't tried-- yet one that seems to work for the JD's and the Boz's of the world.   What's up with the new trend of wearing collars up on knit golf shirts? Also, who decided that Nantucket Reds and turquoise colored pants were a good idea?   F it. Collars up.

      The Blog has hit the low point - but things are picking up. A couple of side projects have kept me sidetracked, and I'll have to explain at a later date.  I spent the weekend in Oyster Bay, New York. Hometown of Teddy Roosevelt and some of the richest people in the Northeast. People I met had the following names: Bostwick, CW, O'Donnell, Mouse, Motty, just to name a few. My friend's place was right on Oyster Bay and also had a pool overlooking the Bay. Amazing. Both nights were capped off by a nice glass of Jack on the rocks. That's my new closer. Really caps the night off in style - and in case you weren't already about to pass out, it finishes the job well.   I don't bang enough chicks.   Last night, I saw Dodgeball with Coosi. Horrible, Horrible movie. Never let Vince Vaughn try to carry a movie because he can't -- great side character, horrible lead. Stiller continues his streak of playing the same exact character. His wife does look the best I've seen her since the days of Hey Dude. That said, I can't wait for Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgundy. Looks hilarious. Also saw the trailer for The Village - which looks fantastic.   Back to not banging enough chicks. I simply don't. Some people do. Some people don't. I don't. Why not? I'm not a bad looking guy...I'm not Brad Pitt, but I'm not Brad Stapleton either. So what gives? I don't try hard enough? I think I don't make enough moneyadfs;. That's neither here nor there. I think I need a name change as well - Matt Werner just ain't cuttin it anymore. I should either start going by MJ and eating at more steakhouses, or make up something poetic like McFarlane.   Huge series for the Sox tonight. If they don't take 2 out of 3, the race for the AL East is over in June. Thanks Theo!

      My new drink of choice - Johnny Walker Black Label - on the rocks with a splash of water. IT's the new me. I don't drink it often, or many of them, but sitting with a Rocks glass in your hand gives you a new perspective on shit.   I like my women like I like my Scotch - 12 years old and mixed up with Coke. HEY

      Let the Mjwern Sexual Revolution commence. Just like sales, it's a numbers game - more outgoing calls you make, the more qualified leads, and the more sales. Telling is selling. More dials= More Reps. Reppy Manual!  That said, my target list has consisted of my age or younger - well that rule is no longer. I'm now cold-calling into the 30-something club. Successful, single, biologically HITTING on all cylinders. It's a can't lose strategy. Got a couple leads in the hopper - will let you all know how it turns out. When I say a couple, I really mean one. alsdk;fj   Just remember this - in sales, all prospects lie. Whether they do it on purpose or not, don't believe a word they say. A sale is made on every call! Either you sell her why she should be with you, or she sells you on why you make her sick. If she asks you for a brochure -- it's a put-off! She'll throw it away! I'm confusing myself now with this metaphor-- but if all else fails: get them drunk?   Tight is right - there is no doubt. Tighter gets harder above 25- also no doubt. The sales cycle is considerably shorter though when you're over 30. SO I"M TOLD. HEY! Not that I know what I'm talking about-- but give me 2 weeks --that's all I'm asking.   Look at the smile on my face! EAR TO EAR BABY!   Single women everywhere just faxed over their congratulations - it said welcome to the club! We're players now boys...SALUT!

      Hit the sox game last night with the Q-dog in the best seats I've ever sat in - about 5 rows off the field behind the on-deck circle. So close that a kid 3 seats down from us got nailed in the arm with a broken bat. Good times. His dad was so excited that he caught the bat that he failed to notive his son sitting there bleeding profusely from the arm. Pretty rich!  After the game dkl;asfj and after a 5 watery Miller Lights, the Qdog and I rendezvoused with a couple of young ladies from the Red Sox legal department. The jury is still out, but the Qdog did no one any favors by belligerently yelling at passerby's to "Get a haircut" and "lose some weight." He was inspired. There were some rich stories exchanged though and times were good. Good up ntil the 20 minute walk home where the Qdog repeatedly offered passing girls donuts from our recent purchase at Store 24. Most people aren't friendly at 1230am - don't know what their problems is, but the Qdog was really in fine form.   On a sidenote - I am getting harrassed by someone who claims that I hit his car -- when I was at work with my car. I might need legal services shortly if he keeps badgering me. As if white paint on the bumper is enough to incriminate!? I have hit cars klj;sdf but not his! CHRIST. Lucky for me I now know a couple good lawyers alk;dfj  Other than that, the summer is in full swing in the Back Bay. I'm exhausted and probably going to sleep at 730pm tonight. I can't take it anymore.  I'm washed up.   mjwern

      Decent weekend. One of the highlights was seeing one of the Top 10 hottest girls of all time that I've ever seen in person. Sorry Tait - but your sister Jessie has entered the Pantheon of hotness. Amazingadsf. Risky D called it the greatest Ass of all time. Now I wouldn't go that far, but she was amazing. The LP has had a collective eye on her since 86 - and has watched her progress from the Minor Leagues to the Bigs. I think she might know she's hot, which is a minus - but seeing as I'll probably never talk to her in my life - so be it.   Saturday night also saw the reunion of Tommy D, Ian, Tait and Risky D. Good times were had by all. Risky D's drive-by comments in the cab at 2 am were hilarious. Needless to say I'm exhausted but that didn't stop me from enjoying a Lobster dinner last night for Father's day - Thanks Pops!  Back to Jessie Larsonasdf sorry. Brad's girlfriend was not shabby either. The Larson family is peaking!! No wonder they didn't want us hanging out with Tait - we've been bringing him down for years!   Closed another deal today for 86 large. Making my yearly total just over 320K. Good times - at this rate I should double my quota - if not triple. Always be closing! A sale is made on every call! 3RIP

      "This blog used to be funny. Now it is stupid and dumb. Matt Werner, the author of the aforementioned blog, is similar to Will Hunting in that he is sitting on a winning ticket of intelligence, and he's too much of a sissy to cash it in. If he's still writing this blog from a sales job in 20 years, coming over to my house to watch Patriots games...I'll kill him. Actually he can watch games with measdf. Honestly though, a sale is made on every blog - whatever that means. Sell yourself on your future, its the RIP of a LIFETIME!" - Gianni Moltisanti

      Jack and Jill - A WB classic - though the 2nd season pales in comparison to the first. The first season of that show was incredible. The launching pad for the huge careers of Amanda Peet, Ivan Sergei, Jaime Pressly and that chick that was in What Women Want.   Am I a chick?  CHRIST  also -   Who's the Boss My Two Dads (where'd that chick go to after Step by Step?)  Perfect Strangers  Basically any show from TGIF - and God knows, I was home every Friday night during this time -- but hey maybe you were out sneaking beers and menthols in the Broomstone parking lot or getting date raped at the Red Roof Inn? I was busy watching Urkle try to win the girl, and busy watching Cory Matthews learn some very valuable lessons. Cherished time...

      Wanda Plenn...Janine...that black guy that held up the convenience store and then became an orderly at Doogie's hospital...they just don't make tv characters like that anymore!  I'm demanding a classic 90s TV network channel to appear on cable - it's about 2 years past due in my mind. The lineup should include:  Doogie Howser MD Wonder Years The last couple years of ALF 90210 Party of Five Felicity  Byrds in Paradise (the short-lived classic starring timothy busfield, seth green, and a very young and supple Jennifer Love Hewitt) The Hogan Family  Boy Meets World  Two Guys and a Girl (and a pizza place) (Wherever that blonde actress is - will u marry me?)  Clarissa Explains it all (where is melissa joan hart?) I'd even throw in a couple episodes of that show Sisters - just for a little Sela Ward action and drama for the ladies  They would show movies like Airborne - the one where Seth Green plays Wiley Man and the new kid in town wins over hot chicks with his sweet rollerblading moves. It's all about street-hockey and then the big race at the end of the movie - a winning formula for any 80s - early 90s flick. If you haven't seen this movie you need to go out and rent it immediately. It's horrible.   I'd watch every night - it would be just like when I was in Middle School (years where my coolness level hit rock bottom - not even on the map). Was there a better hour on Tv than the Doogie/Wonder Years hour?

      So I thought I had a genius idea yesterday. Now I think it's not so much genius as stupid. Anyway - the idea was for a company like Tampax (Playtex?) to develop and market a line of tampons SPECIFICALLY directed towards males who are buying them for their spouse/girlfriend etc. I figured there are probably a ton of guys who are asked by their sig other to pick up some tampons at the store -- only to shamefully avoid the request like red tide. (no pun intended) It could be called the Manpon or something lame like that - basically just so a guy feels somewhat cool and normal when he goes into the store. Maybe it's just as simple as an ad campaign - which could be pretty funny.   Maybe it's a horrible idea.   Which led my roommate and myself to get on the subject that no guy should ever have to go buy a girl a tampon. THEY SHOULD NEVER EVER RUN OUT -- it's not like it's a surprising occurrence! It happens every month for a few days - for most of their lives! Plus there are bodily signs that tell them it's coming! Yet it seems like we both know women who are always in a tough spot and always running out. C'MON. HORRIBLE. Take care of yourselves for the love of christ! GO to BJ's and get a case of a thousand. Don't tell me you don't have any more tampons! Tell me you don't like my tie! Hell, tell me you don't like me -- JUST DON"T WASTE MY FUCKING TIME!

      Last friday night getting Rodgers and Hammersteined (EBShigley, work in essex county), and my roommate and myself meet up with a mutual friend and his buddies from Harvard Business School. Snooze.   Anyway, one of the guys suggests that the place to be for single guys our age is at these new Speed Dating things - where you rotate and meet a bunch of chicks at this event where you pay like 50 bucks or whatever to sign up. Sounds horrible. Sounds like a job interview X 100 degrees of dating pressure/hell.   YET - is that what people do these days? Let's face it - I ain't meeting anyone worth dating long-term in a bar?   Not that I'm looking to date anyone long-term, noooooooo (ibid).   Has anyone ever done speed dating? How is the crop of chicks? People actually pay for this crap? Couldn't I just go down to Chinatown and get a rub and tug for 20 bucks? (On a bad night...HEY!)

      Mluf just asked me the question - What is it like to get laid regularly for months and then to STOP and basically turn the switch to OFF.   I'll say that it definitely depends on the girl. That said, when you step back and think about it, it hurts!   You can't sit around dwelling on it though, noooooooooooooooo! You gotta get your ass out there and take care of that FUCKING DOG!   If anyone feels like being my big brother figure and giving me advice - please let me know. I need a mentor on multiple levels -- job, personal, etc.   Does the saying - He who dies with the most toys - still dies -- have any relevance? Is this even related to anything I've written today? Does this blog ever make sense?   I'm toying with the idea of making this blog into a Single Guy in the City type deal -- chronicling my SEXCAPADES with young underage coeds and older cougars alike.   That would be the stuff of fiction though, since I've got a good story maybe MAYBE once a month. And that is generous. MORE LATER

      Though it offered one of the best first 5 minutes of television show history - the North Shore was ultimately the disappointment of the night. Well that, and the fact that I didn't get laid yet again.   The North Shore went unexplicably wrong when they decided to use the 15 year old in the storyline - over and above shots of her in her bikini. That and the fact that the lead guy is a choposauraus of the worst kind - I didn't know widow's peak and bald dudes were worthy of being lead men in Hollywood. Guess that will put me in good standing in about 10-15 years (maybe sooner!) s;ladfk  I'm really looking forward to Napoleon Dynamite coming out in theaters in the Boston area this week. Everyone check out the trailer if you have not already. Looks amazing - though Lobron was not overly impressed. He never is.   It's hot as hell out there and the peeps are always disappointing in Norwood Mass. I need to get back into the city ASAP.   I'm thinking of mixing it up on a couple fronts. DEVELOPING.   TTP - thanks for the advance notice of your visit. I'll be away that weekeendsafkj big loss I know.   WHAT UP AMY  Todd Rosenthal had his prom this past weekend - congrats TSR. At my prom, my date sucked another guy's dick. We weren't dating, but isn't that a kick in the nuts regardless?   The fact is, I made alot of wrong decisions in High School. I could've used a big brother to set me straight from the beginning. I'm trying not to make the same mistakes now though -- but at 27 is it too late? What should I be doing every night? Should I be going out? Should I be meeting CHICKS? Should I be working later?   JESUS CHRIST - what's a single 27 year old guy to do? What is the course to success -- am I on it?   Is anyone still reading?

      What ever happened to this show? I thought it was underrated at worst - a new sitcom classic at best.   Jonathan Silverman from Weekend at Bernie's fame and Olivia D'Abo from Wonder Years. THAT IS a Can't Lose Combination!  Speaking of can't lose - North Shore tonight on Fox.   Speaking of single - it's good to be back! The relief from having to worry about someone's else is huge. No more feeling vulnerable, no more having to figure that person into the equation. Don't get me wrong - there are alot of great things I will miss, but the relief is palpable!   That said, I got debaucherously drunk Friday night at a local college haunt. GOOD TIMES! Yet Bad times when there was a pissing incident!!!! I won't go into details here. It requires a personal telling of an epic tale that will go down in history...  Let's just say, Timmy B- it's just one more thing we've both DONE. HEY!!!

      All of a sudden this guy is apparently the greatest president of all time...  When did I miss his ascent to Sainthood?   I mean Christ- the amount of people turning out to see this guy?  Probably just a great excuse to skip out on work - I'm all in support of that, but I think there are also those who show up because there is some part of it that makes them feel better as a person.   I don't mean to get off on a tangent here, but I liken it to those people in High School that would go to that kid's father's funeral -- and they probably had never even spoken to that kid before in their lives. BUT HEY! It's a day off from a school and now that that kid is fatherless let's go support him, even though we woulda never talked to him before in his life!!! WOOHOOO  In conclusion, Reagan was a shitty president with a shitty economic policy and a shitty foreign policy (iran contra, funding bin laden and saddam, ETC)  BUT WHOOOOHOOO he had Alzeimher's let's all SUCK HIS DICK!

      On the road again...  Just watching that new show Summerland (on the WB) in my hotel room and it seems like a poor VERY poor man's OC. Needless to say I'm sure I'll be watching every week. Throw a few hot chicks together, a guy with an australian accent, a few surfboards and Rebecca Donaldson Katsopalous and you've got yourself mjwern's pick of the summer -- at least until North Shore starts on Fox.   Alright we're 5 minutes into the show and there is a black person on the cast. Teen Soap no-no. I'm immediately turning the channel. This show has no chance at surviving. Sorry.   The DVD handi-cam from Sony ad was just on tv - looks fantastic. Thanks Cusick.   Tough times the other night in Texas - after all that happened on Sunday, I didn't get to my hotel room until 2am that night due to Tstorms in the area. Bad times.   Met with the DEA today - nothing like lining your hallways with pictures of dead Mexican drug dealers. Hilarious.   Back in town Wednesday night - back to reality?

      Single man again. All for the best I think in the long run...just different people in different places as cliche as that sounds.   It is surreal though breaking up with someone in the place where you were supposed to live together and take that next step...definitely not an easy thing.   But things like this seem to get easier with age and perspective. Or maybe I've just had time to get used to the thoughtlkasjdf.   Mjwernapalooza official freedom fest - coming soon - SUMMER of 2004 in NYC.   Developing...  I'm off to Dallas for 4 days. Probably not such a bad thing...

      You know how you look back at High School and College and think to yourself - "If only I could do that over again, knowing what I know now. I'd be a king." Everyone knows that feeling (well maybe not the lacrosse team who consistently was finger blasting quality poopoo.) But you get the point.   Well my good friend JJ has come up with the perfect remedy to this feeling. He has invented an imaginary younger brother to pass on all that Jay has learned. Genius. Here is the lesson for today:   "My advice to Todd is to go out every Friday and Saturday night at the least because you never know what's going to happen.  I've missed some great things on nights that I stayed home to get a little rest."   - JSR  That being said - everyone must go out tonight and party. It's finally feeling like summer for chrissakes so get out there and make something fucking happen. CHRIST.   You think Todd is staying in tonight?   Not a fucking chance.

      Lobron had a brilliant idea - we need a documentary film crew on Cusick this weekend at the Gtown Reunion. I can't really even imagine the conversations and comedy that that kid will be taking part in.   Off the charts...  Commentary from him so far:  cusickmw: I called desbrow mary donohoe cusickmw: that didn't go over too well cusickmw: lots of ackward - who the hell is that cusickmw: in general the conversation was like this "oh, looks like she got fat, so did she, so did she....."   Also - will anyone really believe Timmy when he tells them he starts Med School in the fall?

      What kind of girl gets a tatoo on the small of her back?   That's a rhetorical question - but here's a real one - would any stand-up guy marry one of those girls? You might as well tatoo "Enter Here" instead of that cool little butterfly design that you thought was edgy.   Now as far as I can tell there are only 2 reasons why a girl would get the tatoo there: 1) it seemed like a really cool and rebellious thing to do when I was 16, and my personal favorite reason: 2) I'm a dirty slut.  I once "dated" a girl in the second category, and sure enough she had a tatoo on the small of her back - it never fails.   Don't get me wrong - I've got nothing wrong with a girl who sports this badge of courage - but if you're gonna party with me you can check your emotional "daddy didn't love me" baggage and your HIV test at the door.

      If we could take Shig's intelligence, Tait's sexual knowledge, Jay's humor, Luf's attitude, Tim's imagination, Lobron's... i'm stumped, and cusick's bank account - now we're talking.   Apparently Cusick has just arrived at Georgetown, I know this because he Blackberried already. Amazing. We can't find a cure for Cancer or HIV, but we can give people like Cusick a huge salary, a blackberry and a passport.   Sums it all up.

      I just realized that I am in more debt now and am worth less now than I was 5 years ago when I graduated from Georgetown.   What do I chalk that up to?   Bad economy?   My utter lack of talent and therefore success?   Bad Luck?   A general jealousy towards my good looks - resulting in spiteful employers?   Lack of drive?   Poor spending choices? (Front row tix for DMB 5 years in a row!! HI LUF! :)   oh well  I'm now accepting donations. Contact me.

      Big shout-out to Awerns today. WHAT UP! sorryasdf  I've got a couple of side projects in the hopper right now. One is a screenplay about a 30-something divorced guy who decides to drive cross country after a nasty divorce and a dead-end job.   Here's just a taste:  David: (V.O.)  It was never my intention to be snorting lines of blow off a Mexican stripper’s chest.  That wasn’t the reason for my trip – just a nice little ancillary benefit. If my wife could see me now. But then again, she is the reason I’m here right? Fuck her.    More on that later.   I'm also putting together a proposal/pitch to WGBH on a jazz documentary that will focus on one of Boston's oldest jazz clubs - Wally's. They have live jazz 365 days a year there with some of the youngest up and coming acts fresh from Berklee Music School. If anyone has any ideas on this please let me know. lsdk;j It's intended on being a new look into the jazz community in the 21st century and it's parallels with the 40s/50s/60s.   More on that later as well...

      Slow day on the Blog. Fact is I got nothing worth writing about really. My personal life is going down the shitter ;lakdjfs though, so I got that going for me - which is nice.   Sox lose a big game in Anaheim, with Pedro on the hill tonight. Boring.   Boring.   Is this the end of the Blog?   Even the Gov't found those 2 missing Propane tankers safely. BORING.   I'm thinking about moving to St. John's and writing movies for a year. DEVELOPING

      Float on!  Really - check out this tune if you get a chance. Song of the summer.    Is anyone even reading this? Christ.   The Sox have been in first place (or tied for first) in the AL East the last 6 Memorial Days. They haven't won the AL east in any one of those years. Thanks Theo!  I hate fat people - but I love fat chicks.   I hate people who bring their own meals on airplanes.   When is a creative guy like myself gonna get a break. I'm going nowhere fast!!  I'm an organizer of people - a man of the grassroots. I might get a PhD in grassroots movements.   Late sox game tonight - which basically means I ain't watching. I'm sizing up the Sopranos from this weekend, and a frozen gourmet pizza. WOOOHOO!   Ch CH CH CHANNNNGGGGEEEEEEES

      So I was reading an article on Jose Padilla - the accused dirty bomber (http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/01/padilla.documents/index.html urlLink  ) and it detailed Al Qaeda's plans to blow up apartment bldgs (in DC, NYC, et al. (hi tim)) simultaneously. I have to admit - genius plan! Now that would be far more horrific than 9/11 and 3/11 combined. It's tough enough making your way in the world today - it takes everything you've got! sdaf   They are definitely thinking outside the box -- and SO MUST WE! When I say think outside the box, I am saying that we need to get creative. Forget about airplanes! Forget about trains! Forget about truck bombs! They are going to hit us and hit us where we least expect it. They are devious, but they are not rash NOOOOOOOOOOO...they are patient. As Gordon Wood wrote in Free Plymouth property rights - a work in essex county - "Liberty is man's sole right to breathe - without it, man is a syncope" (ibid).   In conclusion. Bush is a syncope!  Later I will delve greater into the mind of the modern terrorist - his modus operandi and it's relation (nay - direct correlation) to democracy and the modernization of the non-Western world.

      So I was not out with Cusick last night, but was in constant touch by cell phone and he had some gems last night - classic Qdog:  I get a call about 10pm from Qdog who is at the quasi-swank (for Boston at least) Whiskey Park. He's in a huff telling me that the whole Yankees team is there in the VIP section and that he's standing shoulder to shoulder with AROD and Bernie Williams.   15 minutes later he calls me up and says that he introduced himself to AROD and that AROD blew him off. Great stuff. According to him though he said something like "Hi Mr. Rodriguez, it's really great to meet you - GOOD Luck this weekend."  Sickening. Nice going Cusick. You fucking pussy.   2 hours later I get a call from Cusick saying he's been in a fight. This is where the drunken Qdog takes over and the details are still extremely vague. Something to do with his buddy hitting on some girl with a boyfriend. etc.   An hour after that I get a call from Cusick saying that he is now solo watching girls come out of Daisy Buchanans.&nbsp;I'm speechless at this point...  Minutes later he's finally back at the apartment eating doritos and pounding gatorade on our couch throwing out gems like: "The Qdog is in trouble-- repeat the Qdog is in trouble"   I left him watching Strip Poker on the Playboy channel at&nbsp;3 am.   &nbsp;

      So I've been thinking a lot lately about the collars up look that is sweeping white upper and middle class american men who also tend to wear nantucket red pants, whale belts, lobster belts, summer in the vineyard, have names like Bosworth, chain smoke, go to schools like Colgate and think they are ivy league, etc.   Found this gem on fratty.net:  The single greatest thing to come out&nbsp;in the 80's besides George Michael is the "collar up" method of wearing a polo.&nbsp;While not invented in the 80's, it was brought back and truly revolutionized then.&nbsp;There isn't much about the 80's that isn't frat (which explains how every sorority has an 80's party at least once a year), but the "collar up" is by far the greatest. But you can't just go prancing around town with your collar up every day, you have to do it correctly.&nbsp;Here are some easy to follow guidlines for popping your collar.  1).&nbsp; Pop the collar only on a two or three button polo...button down shirts just don't work, as much as you might want them to. Other pieces of attire can be substituted from time to time, such as the fleece, but can only be ruled on in&nbsp;a case by case basis, so pop at your own discretion, or those of a brother with better fashion sense than you. Multiple polos worn in layers must have both collars popped at all times.  2).&nbsp; Popping the collar causes you to look cool, but do NOT&nbsp;act as if you think you are cool- you will be trying too hard.&nbsp;Act as if you frat on a daily basis.   3).&nbsp; Do not pop the collar at any event in which you don't know at least 5-10 people.&nbsp;You run the risk of being ostracized, and must have multiple other fratties to back you up, in style or physically.  4).&nbsp; When popping the collar, do not button the top button. This&nbsp;produces the look of a dog halo, and is very unapealing.  5).&nbsp; When popping the collar, you must walk around with a completely lost look on your face, as if you are really hammered, even when you're not.&nbsp; This is frat.

      Do I have a problem if I'm loving the new Ashlee Simpson song?  &nbsp;  It's pure gold - the perfect pop song.  &nbsp;  "Ohhh it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real &nbsp; I like the way that feels"  &nbsp;  Geniusadf  &nbsp;  I've got problems.

      Forgot to mention the part of the night (after the strip club) where Cusick demanded we drive by Chinatown in Boston at 2 am to see if any strippers were hanging out on the streets outside the closed clubs.   Then I ended up driving down the wrong way of a one way city street into oncoming cabs.   Christ what a night  In the immortal words of John F Cusick - "You'll have plenty of time to sleep when you are dead."  The QDOG is back!

      Huge happenings last night with DMB in town at the Tweeter Center. The show was ancillary to the partying as usual - especially since DMB is a nostalgia act now.   Anyway, I picked up the Qdog from the Norwood train station and we made our way down to Great Woods - parking next to the hottest girl we had both seen in quite some time. She told us the guy she was at the show with was NOT her boyfriend so we both thought she was ready to party. She got weird after the show thoughtasdl;f sorry. I love the after-show scene - for the diehards only.   Some random highlights of the night:   Cusick interogating the girl who does the between innings Sweeper routine at Fenway Park - she was amazing!   Cusick bringing beers to the aforementioned hot chick up on the lawn l;aksdfj don't ask.  We ran into John Markunas - he's running a Baggataway store and had a tighty 21 year old girlfriend - I slapped him high five over that.   Cusick and I debating on whether or not to go to a strip club when it was only open for another 30 minutes.  Cusick and I going to Squire's Gentlemen's club in Revere ;lkajdsf at 1:35am.   Cusick disappearing into the private dances room for the remaining 20 minutes of the night.  Cusick passing out on the couch.  Seeing Cusick passed out with an informercial blaring on TV at 335 am.   What a night.

      Every minute you waste not renting the dvd - The Office: Season 1 is a minute you are missing the best TV show to ever come out of the UK. It's a show in the same vein as Curb Your Enthusiasm - and all of the Christopher Guest movies (Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, etc) and it's pure genius. They filmed 2 seasons of it - and I think both are out now on DVD (or Season 2 is coming soon).   David Brent is the best character since George Costanza (probably better actually). Seriously - go out tonight and rent Season 1. You won't be let down.  Other than that, I'm back on the Sox wagon for a pivotal series with the A's. Huge.   Also, I am off the older women train. Horrible idea-- just horrible. I'm back to 19 year oldsalkfdj; TIGHT IS RIGHT.   Always be repping...

      Sections 2 and 3 (brief) are below...  -----------------------------  Personal Ad:  I know what you're after and I'm waiting.  Box 23.  That was it – just one simple line. At first it was a joke – just a good sick twisted laugh in a SoHo bar. He couldn’t be serious – a tad bored, a little Coked up and delirious, but not serious.  After that first night, the joke became more detailed and took on a life of its own. 2 bored writers sitting in a New York City pub, with nothing better to do than sketch an idea.   From the beginning, they both agreed that there was no such thing as a perfect murder. It was the contrived notion of bad fiction and Hitchcock movies.  After each night the idea became more and more developed – more and more crystallized. Weeks later, neither one could be quite sure when the idea became plan. There was no moment of realization, no moment of clarity. Like any “good” idea, the more complex and structured it became, the more reality seemed to encroach.   ---------------------------------   They are coming for me. I can see them in the mornings when it is foggy. I will be ready though. I won’t give them the satisfaction. I’ll be ready.   ----------  To be continued...

      I caught the tail end of this show last night and I have a weird crush on Nicole Richie.  I think that it is just the way she says: "that's hot" or "loves it" that makes me like her. Maybe it's her money.  One week from now I'll be driving with Vito and Mlufkin to far northern Vermont for the final Phish shows. I think I'm as much (if not more) excited about the trip and the experience than I am about the actual concerts.  Anyone catch the final Ashlee Simpson show last night? I missed it.  Anyone see the Village?  I"m looking forward to seeing Open Water. Looks right in my wheelhouse. I won't swim in the Ocean - so the movie will not affect my habits. I know JJ and BF Carroll can respect that. I heard they used real sharks in the filming of Open Water as well.

      Tough times in Mjwern's World. Not much new to report.  Did some prerequisite celeb ballwashing last week during the DNC in Boston. Sightings at the after-party I attended: Nancy Pelosi, Wesley Clark. Definitely B-List - no question, but hey it's something for Boston.  Qdog and I ran it absurdly hot - staying out till 4 am last Monday Night. Worst idea ever - but it seemed like a decent one after 5 Krispy Kremes and a ton of liquor.  My new drink is Jack Daniels on the rocks. It makes a statement - not a BIG one, but it's something.  I also think that it's cool to smoke cigarettes. Not that I do it (at least not often at all), but there is something old Hollywood/Very Cool about sitting at an Oak bar, drinking Jack on the rocks and smoking a ciggie.  That said - I can't pull off that look. I wish I could. I think my hair's too short.  It's a good look though is my point. Anyone who says it isn't - isn't very cool.  Sorry
