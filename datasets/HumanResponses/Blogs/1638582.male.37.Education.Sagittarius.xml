       urlLink Life With Alacrity: The Dunbar Number as a Limit to Group Sizes   This article introduced me to a concept I hadn't really thought about before (well, not in any systematic way) - the relationship between group size and group functioning.  I think we have some intuitive ideas about this (and if it is an adaptive process then we should do) but I hadn't seen the research, until now.

      Tom Smith, whom some might know as the 'guru of blogging' has been visiting Ultralab South and came to visit us on Friday last.  He convinced us (ok he convinced me) that we should be creating and writing in these things as much as possible (and trying to create communities etc.).  So here am I on Monday morning writing away again... but this is one of those times where I have very little of substance to say.  What's most important is the habit.  If I keep writing in this thing then eventually there will be something worth reading, because I'll start committing more thoughts to (paper?).

      Now that I am up and running I thought I might explain a little bit about my intentions for this blog...  ... to the right I am busy placing links via blogrolling.com.  I've found that since I am not paying for the service I can't limit the number of links, so I shall be on the lookout for a free service with more features (yeah right!).  The links are mainly to education (including online education) sites but include Stephen Downes Edu-RSS feed which is pretty much a gold mine of information and news about education matters.  Stephen's site is there too as it is one of my favourites for a thoughtful read.  As I myself grow more thoughtful I'll be placing some actual content in the blog itself.  Perhaps next week after Semester one draws to a close!

      Ako is the Maori word for 'teaching and learning' (Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand).  The reason for Ako's existence is the discussion and dissemination of ideas related to learning and teaching - mainly from a tertiary or higher ed perspective but not exclusively.  I'm hoping to create a collection of ideas and links that someone somewhere (besides me) will find useful.  Ako is created from deep within Middle Earth (that's the South Island of New Zealand for those with a more literal streak) where the author is engaged in consultative work in tertiary education.

       urlLink JURIST - Study Law Online   I found this site in response to a query made by my better half, who missed part of her true calling in life (she'd make a great lawyer).  I decided to have a look for online law education.  Can one study law online?  eLearning gurus would probably say 'why not'?  But at the top of this site there is information that suggests that this is not necessarily received wisdom...

      I've been thinking a lot lately about the question of ability; i.e. what is it that we mean when we say that students have the 'ability' to study at University level?  The word is normally used in conjunction with statements about a lack of ability (a particular student lacks the ability to study etc.).    This idea seems to be anathema to a lot of people working in education.  From a constructionist/postmodern viewpoint, no one lacks ability, it's just that some people did not have the right environment/encouragement/what have you and so present accordingly.  Fair enough, in a sense.  At least anecdotally I am aware of a number of people who fit this description (or a similar one) that when given the chance did very well.  The problem arises if this notion of ability is something very real - perhaps intelligence is a very real thing and one needs it to succeed at this level.  If this is true it has implications for our ideas about 'widening access' to University study.  Without something that more or less equates to an ability test, we have the potential for admitting people who lack this ability, where it becomes our responsibility to ensure that they have the tools to do as well as they can.  Furthermore, if we succomb to the pressure to widen access and we end up admitting more students who lack this ability, we will be under further pressure to drop standards.     I'm not really settled on this issue.  I know a lot of people who would subscribe to the ability theory, and I know people who would find it abhorrent.  Certainly from the point of view of persons from minority groups the notion of ability has been used against them without justification, and I think they are right to be wary of it.  But at the same time it is difficult to put aside nagging doubts that occur from observing the struggles of some students to come to grips with  thinking .  I am willing to listen to persuasive communications from either camp...

       urlLink praxis   Elaine is a real teacher (i.e. properly trained) and has probably forgotten more about teaching than I will ever know...
