      William Safire has his say on the Passion of the Christ:  "The word "passion" is rooted in the Latin for "suffer." Mel Gibson's movie about the torture and agony of the final hours of Jesus is the bloodiest, most brutal example of sustained sadism ever presented on the screen."

      By Dave Rozelle, Madison Capital Times  The president of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. -- Article II, Section 4, the U.S. Constitution   George W. Bush may well be voted out of office in November. That is as it should be. He deserves defeat. But defeat alone is not enough. Justice will be cheated if this president is expelled with only election-night headlines ringing in his ears.   The time has come for us to at least speak the I word out loud: Impeachment. The charges? One accusation dwarfs all others - the highest of the Constitution's "high crimes." It speaks for those human beings, both American and Arab, who would not have died by military violence had this nation not been consciously deceived into war by its chief executive. No crime by a president could rank more rankly. "An immoral war was thus waged," as Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu put it in a speech in England last week.

      Ripped from the  urlLink Kalamazoo Gazette    On most matters,  urlLink Lorence Wenke  is a staunch conservative.   The 58-year-old state representative from Richland Township opposes abortion and gun control. He backs small government and tax cuts.   A member of a fundamentalist church, he includes a verse of Scripture on his business card and participates in a Bible-study group for state legislators.   One would be hard-pressed to find a more unlikely advocate for gay rights.   Yet Wenke plans to be one of perhaps only two House Republicans voting against putting on the November ballot a  urlLink Marriage Protection Amendment , which would change Michigan's constitution to ban gay marriage.   And he is opposing the bill, he said, out of a long-held and deeply felt belief that discrimination against homosexuals violates democratic principles and his Christian values.   "I kept quiet when African-Americans were facing discrimination," he said. "There have been too many people who have been discriminated against in my lifetime, and this time I'm not going to sit quietly while somebody is being mistreated.   "This is a matter of conscience. There's nothing in it for me."   He said his vote "will hurt me personally," and it already has.   Two Sundays ago, while Wenke and his wife were attending services at Richland Bible Church, the parking lot was blanketed with leaflets informing church members of Wenke's opposition to the Marriage Protection Amendment and urging them to take Wenke to task.    urlLink Gary Glenn , president of the Midland-based  urlLink American Family Association  of Michigan, which distributed the fliers, said, "We thought it was an effective way to communicate with a constituency who we thought would be most likely to persuade Rep. Wenke to change his mind."   Glenn also said that, by opposing the proposed amendment, Wenke would be denying his constituents an opportunity to vote on an issue of vital concern, and there is little doubt it would hurt Wenke politically.   "He's taking a standing contrary to President  urlLink George W. Bush , against the Republican Party and against almost every Republican in the Legislature," Glenn said. "It will hurt him and it should. ... I'm sure the people of his legislative district would prefer to have someone who will represent their views on something so fundamental."   Wenke knows it's likely that colleagues, friends and constituents in his heavily Republican district will be perplexed and even upset that he is voicing support for gay rights in terms even some Democrats are hesitant to use.   "It's certainly going to make re-election more difficult," said Wenke, whose term expires this year.   Still, he said, it's a matter of principle.   "It's all about this double standard and unequal treatment," he said. "It's just not fair."   A spiritual context   Wenke has pondered the gay-rights issue for years, but as an intellectual exercise rather than a personal issue.   "I'm not gay. Nobody in my family is gay," said Wenke, who has been married for 37 years and has two grown children, including a son who is a minister. "I've never had a homosexual experience in my life."   His one personal connection is a childhood friend, Doug Sipsma. On the wall of his Lansing office there is a framed newspaper article about Sipsma and his male partner, who were recently married in Ottawa, Ontario.   "Doug and I grew up together," Wenke said. "We were the only two boys in our class of seven at Comstock Christian School, first through sixth grade."   He and Sipsma later graduated together from Kalamazoo Christian High School in the early 1960s, Wenke said. Theirs was a childhood steeped in religion, with church services twice on Sundays, catechism class one night a week and school classrooms where the Bible was the most important textbook.   Wenke went on to Calvin College before he took over the family bedding-plant business and turned it into a multimillion-dollar operation. In 1994, Wenke moved to the political arena, getting elected to the Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners, eventually serving as chairman. He won his state House seat in 2002, campaigning on a platform of tax cuts and economic growth.   Wenke didn't stay in touch with Sipsma after high school. But over the years, he heard from mutual acquaintances how Sipsma had divorced his wife and come out of the closet as a gay man.   Sipsma's story got Wenke thinking about the causes of homosexuality and whether it was a sin. He researched the topic, delving into scientific studies and the teachings of the Christian Reformed Church.   By the late 1980s, Wenke had decided "that popular opinion on this subject was wrong," that the so-called homosexual lifestyle was not a choice, but a biological destiny.   And if sexual orientation is not a choice, he decided, then discriminating against gays made no more sense than discrimination based on race. He said he strongly believes that if more people understood that homosexuality is biological, much of the opposition to gays would ebb.   When a Christian Reformed minister started an organization 15 years ago to gain greater acceptance of gays within the church, Wenke said he contributed money to support his efforts and brought him to Kalamazoo for a series of conversations.   It was no coincidence that Wenke's first support of gay rights came in a religious context.   "Certainly my No. 1 priority in life is my relationship with God," Wenke said.   At the last State of the State address, his guest of honor was his pastor. And he keeps his business closed on Sunday, pointing to the Bible's Fifth Commandment.   "I'm one of the few dinosaurs that says this should be a day of worship and rest," he said. "Most of my competitors are open on Sunday. Sunday is the second-best shopping day of the week. But I still think this is a commandment that should be kept."   Modern society's blithe acceptance of Sunday as a good day to visit the mall leads him to a larger point -- that devout Christians already have adjusted Biblical teachings to fit their needs, which should allow some slack on the issue of homosexuality.   He offers quotes from the Bible to support his point that the Scripture is even more condemning of divorce than homosexuality. Yet divorced and remarried couples are now welcomed at even fundamentalist churches, he said. Likewise, he said, many denominations, including Christian Reformed, have moved beyond the Biblical teaching against women speaking in church.   While he supports the new role of women in the church and greater acceptance of divorce, he said, it shows how "we Christians have decided that parts of the Bible don't apply to us anymore."   "So if we can put aside the teachings on women, on divorce, on the Sabbath -- and those are all things that we choose -- then why not on homosexuality, when we don't choose our sexual orientation?" Wenke said.   "Why can't we be as kind and generous in interpreting the Bible for homosexuals as we are for ourselves?"   'Suicide mission'   Wenke is politically ambitious.   He wouldn't mind becoming a state senator, speaker of the House, a congressman.   He wonders aloud if his stance on this issue will kill his political career. "I'm on a suicide mission," he said.   He does not want to be a spokesman for gay rights. "This isn't my issue," Wenke said. "Job growth, taxes, smaller government -- those are my issues. ... I didn't come here to fight this battle. I'm sort of angry that it's come up the way it has."   Wenke said he hasn't talked much to his Republican colleagues or his friends about his feelings on gay rights.   "It's difficult to talk to people about this," he said. "People have their opinions and they're usually solid in their convictions."   Friends and colleagues say that, while Wenke's stance on gay rights is surprising, he is known for his strong opinions and occasionally unconventional views.   "He loves to be a gadfly," said Larry Kiser, pastor of Richland Bible Church. "He gets a little mad sometimes at the right-wing Christian mentality. ... He think there's a tendency to oversimplify."   Rep. Jack Hoogendyk, the conservative Republican from Texas Township, said that, in the Legislature, Wenke is regarded as a dependable vote for the GOP; still, "he's not as predictable as some might have predicted." His reputation is such, Hoogendyk said, that Democrats were a majority on the Kalamazoo County board when Wenke was elected chairman.   Neither Hoogendyk nor Kiser, who are strong supporters of the Marriage Protection Act, have talked to Wenke about his view.   Kiser plans to vigorously lobby Wenke on the issue. "Lorence is no theologian, and I think he's wrong in how he's interpreting Scripture," he said.   But even if neither man changes the other's mind, Kiser said, it is unlikely to affect their close friendship. Others at Richland Bible Church might not be as understanding, he said.   "Obviously, it will have some effect on how some people in this church perceive Lorence," Kiser said. "It will make it difficult for him to have a leadership position."   Yet Hoogendyk and Kiser hesitate to say how much Wenke's stance will ultimately hurt him -- politically and otherwise.   Kiser was upset by the American Family Association's leaflet campaign, saying their methods were mean-spirited and immoral.   Hoogendyk said he's interested in talking with Wenke, but stressed he doesn't want this issue to jeopardize their personal and professional relationship.   "I will always respect a person more who has a principle behind his vote," Hoogendyk said, "than someone who votes with me most of the time, but doesn't have a core."   Wenke said he was conflicted about speaking out. But, he added, "the whole movement against homosexuals is a matter of thinking that God is against homosexuals. Well, I'm going to stand up against it."

      Ripped from a posting at the Chimp:  The Rules on Rush Limbaugh  1. Rush is the biggest hypocrite of modern media.  2. Rush accuses his opponents of doing the things he does. And of all his accusations, his most clever and important one is that his opponents are guilty of this very tactic. This is designed to let him get away with hypocrisy by accusing the other side of doing it first. Although the order of an accusation has nothing to do with its legitimacy, Rush knows that the first person accused of hypocrisy, is more likely to appear the hypocrite.  3. When Rush describes liberals or other opponents in a mean-spirited way, he is telling you who he is. Rush says this very thing about liberals, in general, so see Rule 2.  4. Rush demands context only when he or someone with similar ideaology is being scrutinized for a controversial or dumb comment or behavior.  5. Rush has collected welfare, abused prescription drugs and has had three wives. Despite his track record, he has no qualms about giving lectures on values. He continues to talk, and fools continue to believe him.  6. Rush has never done a political broadcast without lying. Not one.  7. If Rush stops lying, his show won't work and he will lose ratings.  8. Rush tries to say mainstream media, as a rule, pushes a left-wing agenda. This is done because fair reporting often runs in opposition to his theories. Though isolated cases of left-wing bias exist, isolated cases of right-wing bias exist as well. Rush purposefully does not cite cases of right-wing bias.  9. Rush is a con-artist. That is, a conservative, who, like a confidence person or con-man, uses deception to gain the trust of his audience. Once trust is established, Rush uses it for his own gains. Openthreat commonly refers to him as Con-artist Limbaugh. The nickname was coined here. If you repeat it, O.T. asks that you cite the source.  10. Rush positions himself simultaneously as an underdog and a media behemoth. The former allows him to squirm around charges that he is damaging American culture: "I simply report the news!" It also allows him to perpetuate the left-wing media bias myth, which he constantly squawks in order to portray himself as David, to mainstream media's Goliath. The latter allows him to pompously boast of the success and reach of his program: "The most listened to radio talk-show in America."  11. Rush did not write his first book, 'The Way Things Ought To Be'. It was ghost-written by a John Fund, whose job according to Limbaugh "...was to interview me on tape, then write the first draft from the transcriptions of the interviews." Real authors don't write this way.  12. Rush tries to pin every negative deed, political or otherwise, done by individual liberals at any time, to liberalism en masse. This is refered by O.T. as the Rush to Lump Method. For example, if one liberal anywhere, at any time, sets fire to a building, then all liberals are arsonists using the Rush to Lump Method. Rush complains that liberals, as a whole, employ this tactic to smear conservatives (i.e. Republicans are racists). O.T. concedes that many liberals also employ this tactic. But Rush, while denying engaging in this tactic himself, has turned it into a flamboyant, weekly exercise—which he performs more often and with more malice than anyone else. Rush's broadcasts, past and present are proof of this.  13. When discussing an issue, political or otherwise, Rush often sets up a deliberately fraudulent compare-and-contrast scenario. It involves offering a dishonest generalization of his opponent's view—which is supposed to be bad. It is followed by his own carefully crafted, but equally dishonest view—which is supposed to be good. And to sell it further, Rush sometimes even interrupts the process to mention that he's being accurate and fair. He is lying.  14. Rush perpetuates the notion that Democrats exclusively, play political hardball. His phony depiction of the political war is one between liberals who play dirty, and conservatives who don't. Both sides play dirty.  15. Rush offers isolated cases of social program failures or shortcomings as proof that government assistance, in general, is bad. The assumption is as fair or unfair as indicting private enterprise, in general, for the isolated misdeeds or failures of some businesses.

      Ripped whole cloth from  urlLink http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/03/04/BAGL65E0M71.DTL   The Bush administration slashed San Francisco's federal AIDS budget by more than $4 million, a 12 percent cut and one of the biggest in the nation, which local health officials fear could land more people in the emergency room.   Oakland was hit with a 5.9 percent reduction in federal funding, and San Jose saw a 5.1 percent decrease.   "Certainly it's going to be devastating,'' said Jim Illig, director of government relations for Project Open Hand, which provides meals in San Francisco and Alameda County to homebound patients, many of whom have AIDS.   U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson this week announced the new Ryan White CARE grants, which are doled out to the 51 metropolitan areas in the United States hit hardest by the AIDS-HIV epidemic.   The money, aimed at low-income patients who lack medical insurance or whose coverage is not enough, is used for everything from doctor's visits and medication to substance abuse treatment and food.   In San Francisco, with about 15,000 AIDS and HIV patients -- the largest caseload in the Bay Area -- the funding cuts will affect legal aid, meal programs, transportation subsidies, substance abuse treatment and alternative health care, such as acupuncture and herbal remedies, according to James Loyce Jr., the San Francisco's Department of Public Health deputy director, who oversees the AIDS office.   "The cuts are huge,'' Loyce said. "There's no way in the world I can tell you that the loss will not hurt. These are the kinds of services that keep people out of the hospitals and emergency rooms.''   He predicted the impact would start to be felt in another two months.   Loyce said his department expected at worst a 5 percent reduction. The 12 percent cut was a body blow. "We heard there were going to be cuts," he said. "We just didn't expect it to be this bad.''   Only 11 of the 51 targeted metropolitan areas in the nation saw their allocation go up this year. Topping the list was New York City, with a 17.5 percent increase. Closer to home, Sacramento's new grant nears $3 million, an increase of almost 12 percent.   Percentage-wise, only St. Louis and Newark, N.J., sustained bigger hits than San Francisco, at 13.8 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. The allotment for the San Francisco metropolitan area also includes money for San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.   Nationwide, the total Ryan White CARE budget for the year is $595 million, a $5 million decrease from last year.   The allocation formula is complicated, based in part on the number of HIV and AIDS cases in a given area and in part on how an individual city's application stacks up against the applications of other cities competing for the money.   It was the competitive portion that hurt San Francisco most this time around, said Douglas H. Morgan, a division director at Health and Human Services who administers the Ryan White program.   He wouldn't go into detail, saying that a report would be sent to city officials in the coming weeks highlighting "strengths and weaknesses'' of the application.   "It may not be that the city screwed up,'' he offered. Instead, he suggested, it may be that the applications from other cities were deemed stronger by the federal review panel that judges the applications.   Morgan said Wednesday that San Francisco could appeal the allocation decision, "but we've awarded all the dollars appropriated.''   Loyce said he was not holding out hope for more money, but his agency will ask San Francisco's federal representatives, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, for help.   Illig, the Project Open Hand representative whom Mayor Gavin Newsom tapped this week to serve on the Health Commission, suggested that the grant allocations were tinged by politics, with the Bush administration hitting the liberal stronghold of San Francisco extra hard. "I definitely think this was targeted,'' he said. "I'm hoping people will be outraged and won't take this lying down.''   Morgan said politics did not come into play and that the decisions were based on "an objective review.''   The news comes as San Francisco, like most local governments throughout the state, are contending with their own budget deficits that may result in even deeper cuts to public health care and other city services. Unlike past years when Ryan White money came up short and the city stepped in with local funding, a local bailout this time around would be iffy, at best.   "It makes a bad situation worse,'' said San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who chairs the Board of Supervisors Finance Committee. "People are going to get hurt.''

      I have been remiss, of late, in updating S-E, and so, I return with this montage, as it were, of interest items.  First, I think everyone will be resting better tonight, secure in the knowledge that Roy Horn (of Seigfried & Roy)  urlLink is feeling and doing better , after the meowfest that closed the popular  urlLink Siegfried & Roy show .  (Whew! I can finally stop nuking that mug of whole milk before bedtime now!)  Can't say the same for some Haitians who were  urlLink shot and killed by US Marines  in the peacekeeping effort following the questionable resignation and flight by "ex" President Aristide.  Nor could you say it was a good day for a would-be initiate of the Masons, who was  urlLink fatally shot during his initiation ceremony . Speaking as a Theatre Arts degree holder, an actor/director/stage manager/etc. in my own right, all I can say is ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PROPS.  In other, more serious news, an effort to define marriage through a Consitutional amendment in my fair state, the State of Michigan, has  urlLink failed by eight votes in the legislature . You may recall I mentioned a Republican legislator a few days ago who was opposed to this move, on Constitutional grounds. You should  urlLink write to Republican Representative Lorence Wenke  to thank him for  urlLink being a true patriot and standing firm in his 'no' vote . The vote is  urlLink recorded in the House Journal .  Gary Glenn, homophobe, fundamentalist hatemonger, and President of the American Family Association of Michigan, says Wenke will 'almost certainly' face a challenger in the Republican primary, next election.  urlLink Write to Mr. Glenn  and tell him what an ass he is.  That's about all for this morning. More news later on this station. We now return you to your regularly-scheduled web surfing.

      Well, last night I did my taxes, and as is happens, the Feds giveth, and the State taketh away.  Meanwhile, a gent by the name of Wayne Madsen is  urlLink having his say , over at  urlLink Online Journal . Apparently people are taking umbrage with his comparison of BushCo to the Hitler regime. Now, I wouldn't call BushCo a Neo-Nazi machine, but Mr. Madsen makes some alarming comparisons.  According to Jimmy Breslin, Herr Bush the Younger  urlLink doesn't like to get his feet dirty . Guess something on him has to be kept clean.  Speaking of clean, no one ever said hockey was, and that was proven recently, when a particularly brutal act of aggression  urlLink left an NHL player with a broken neck . Way to go, hockey.  But let's get back to my favorite subject, the glaring bad judgement of BushCo. NASA admin O'Keefe seems to be  urlLink catching flack  for the decision to wrap up the mission of the  urlLink Hubble telescope early , before the follow-on machine is even launched. Guess someone really wants to move ahead and get Halliburton to Mars to drill like a dentist on crack.  Anyhow, that's all for now. back to the salt mine.

      It has been apparant to many right-thinking people for some time that George W. Bush is utterly incapable of admitting fault, having never faced owning up to anything. This flaw is exacerbated by (and feeds off) his pathalogical lack of curiousity, which means that, so long as his subordinates are enthusiastic about an idea, his approval is a cake walk. Otherwise, he might have to actually read a proposal, or ask probing questions.  I am stunned at Bush's response to the prisoner torture/killing under American auspices in Iraq: "The actions of these few people do not reflect the hearts of the American people." ( urlLink Link ).  While these actions may not reflect the amorphous, intangible "hearts" of Americans, they DO serve to define the general view of the USA in the eyes of the Muslim world. They also shine a light on our very American prediliction for marginalizing what the Bush men like to refer to as "brown" people.   So, instead of dancing around the subject, what Herr Bush should be doing is admitting that mistakes were made on his watch, and promptly moving to set an example in the prosecution of those responsible, while moving on a parallel track to review policies and procedures for military and intelligence operations and making substantive changes to prevent such abuse in the future.  Of course, that would entail admitting a mistake and owning up to the whole mess. And as we have seen, W is incapable of even the smallest sliver of self-criticism.

      Ah, I love being American. Only in America do you have such a wide range and variety of expression, as well as the freedom to call shit shit and not have to explain it's because of the stink.  First of the worst today is George Will, who, building on a premise put forth in a book by Michael Barone, asserts that "red" (Bush) states have a 'harder' sensibility than the "blue" (heretical and liberal) states. Basically, blue states are flaccid and red states are turgid.  Perhaps Mr. Will himself has a case of the 'blues?'  ******  Bill Kristol, Editor of the Weekly Slander-er, I mean Standard-allowed himself to be cornered or lead into fessing up on the Daily Show that W had driven this country "into the ditch."  He was looking pretty haggard, too, as though he was shagged out following a prolonged squawk.  He needs a vacation. He himself stated it had been a rough last six weeks.  Well, try a rough last three and a half years, Billy Boy.  ******  Radio host Michael Savage tries to one-up Rush Limbaugh (standard bearer of the Worst and Dimmest) by musing on the Abu Graib (why can NO ONE say that name?) thusly:  "[T]ake their deepest fear, the pig, the dog, the woman with the leash, and use it on them to break them!"  "Use ... [l]ittle, ugly women. And let 'em take big strapping Iraqis and put 'em on leashes naked."  "Instead of putting joysticks, I would have liked to have seen dynamite put in their orifices."  Ah, methinks Michael needs some savage lovin'. Maybe he and Flush Limpdick can share a tender moment at opposite ends of a two-seater dildo.  ******  Finally, for now, the Catholic Church in America continues it's efforts to have its tax exemption revoked:  "The bishop of Colorado's second-largest Roman Catholic diocese has issued a pastoral letter saying Catholics cannot receive Communion if they vote for politicians who support abortion rights, stem-cell research, euthanasia or gay marriage."  In related news, you're still cool if all you do is bugger little boys and/or take part in a pedo cover up.  Old single men wearing dresses, telling people how to vote. No wonder I;m fallen, and refuse to get up. (Although I DID have fish for lunch today...)

      Posted this response on Atrios' site, to an argument against the "McCain as VP" war cry:   *******  Allow me to serve as flamebait.  I would welcome McCain as VP for the Dem ticket. I voted for him in the Michigan Repug Primary in 2000 (partly to screw W and FORMER Michigan Governor John "The Pig Farmer" Engler, partly because I have a lot of genuine respect for McCain).  But bipartisanship?  The "McCain as VP" meme has NAUGHT, ZILCH, ZERO, ZIP to do with bipartisanship. Anyone claiming it does is simply incapable of seeing it as the supreme trump card that it is, against a handfull of jokers. If anything, it is about the potential to irreparably torpedo Bush/Cheney '04:  1. War President? I'll see your chickenhawk 'War" prez and raise you two ACTUAL WOUNDED VETERANS who were fighting Charlie in SE Asia while W was fighting bra straps Stateside.  Sure, Clarke is a vet, but...  2. WAR PRESIDENT? How's McCain in your FACE, Chickenhawk? Thought you'd let your Clever Machiavels and Dirty Tricksters smear him in South Carolina in 2000, eh? Well, let us add insult to injury by beating you bloody in November and letting McCain the PATRIOTIC WOUNDED VETERAN POW get some extra KICKS in your side! (I love to give the underdog credit for the assist, you see).  Paybacks are a BIIIIITCH, you unrepentant fratboy posterchild for retroactive abortion....  3. Gooooodbye evil "Liberal" tag. Heeeeello shiny "Patriotic American Public Servants/Even Keel" tag. Kerry and McCain both know how the Senate and House work, intimately, and certainly wouldn't stand for any BULLSHIT from that quarter. McCain would, in fact, be in a position likely to quench his unmitigated desire to bitchslap errant porkbarrelling members of Congress, thus helping to erase W's deficit (the budget deficit, not the intellectual deficit). Hell, that ALONE would keep him too busy to attempt dismantling Roe v. Wade.  4. Did somebody say WAR PRESIDENT? BushCo allowed and fucking ***ENABLED*** TORTURE in Iraq (an illegal war, prepared for with illegal and impeachable fund-shifting). HELLO?!?!? McCain was a POW in Vietnam, and is an actual, empathetic HUMAN BEING, unlike W the Psychopath. He even walked out after Inhofe (R, Hates Humans) took NeoCon/Pug "moral relativism" arguments and did a Mexican Hat Dance on them, by being "outraged" at The Outrage. (If, by 'outrage' one means that Inhofe was trying to be a good soldier and throw himself on a grenade clumsily dropped by George "Butterfingers" Bush.  5. REMEMBER VIETNAM?   THAT... was the war that W sat out in the Texican Airborne Cubscouts cuz daddy knew some troop leaders. While Kerry was shooting and taking fire, and McCain was put up at the Palacial Hanoi Hilton--with hot and cold running interrogation--W was busy getting his Chickenhawk Scouts merit badge in "Landing Poontang far from DaNang."  Finally... In all seriousness, I am well aware that there are fine Democratic candidates who could run as Kerry's VP choice, and BushCo would still lose big. However, I am also convinced most of them would be glad to help, a la Dean (be still! my aching heart!), to achieve Democratic victory from behind the scenes, whilst Kerry bludgens Shrubbery's war "record" with a club called McCain.  McCain, the underdog maverick whom BushCo unfairly (and in an ungentlemanly way) smeared in 2000, would appeal to a wide swath of Democrats--we ***HEART*** underdogs!!!! This would conveniently lend appeal for fiscal conservatives and flummox arguments about Kerry's purported Liberal spending record. And McCain's veteran status would almost automatically guarantee the Vet vote (did I mention that he was a POW in VIETNAM while Georgie Boy was Stateside, trying to convince his coke-addled pecker to stiffen up?).  Flame away!

      Scott McClellan's mother is the Texas State Comptoller. She is also an asshole.  Political dynasties should really be outlawed...  *********************************  Unitarian group denied tax status  By R.A. Dyer  Star-Telegram Staff Writer   AUSTIN - Unitarian Universalists have for decades presided over births, marriages and memorials. The church operates in every state, with more than 5,000 members in Texas alone.  But according to the office of Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn, a Denison Unitarian church isn't really a religious organization -- at least for tax purposes. Its reasoning: the organization "does not have one system of belief."  Never before -- not in this state or any other -- has a government agency denied Unitarians tax-exempt status because of the group's religious philosophy, church officials say. Strayhorn's ruling clearly infringes upon religious liberties, said Dan Althoff, board president for the Denison congregation that was rejected for tax exemption by the comptroller's office.  "I was surprised -- surprised and shocked -- because the Unitarian church in the United States has a very long history," said Althoff, who notes that father-and-son presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams were both Unitarians.  His church is just one of several Unitarian congregations in North Texas, including churches in Fort Worth, Arlington and Southlake.  Strayhorn's ruling, as well as a similar decision by former Comptroller John Sharp, has left the comptroller's office straddling a sometimes murky gulf separating church and state.  What constitutes religion? When and how should government make that determination? Questions that for years have vexed the world's great philosophers have now become the province of the state comptroller's office.  Questions about the issue were referred to Jesse Ancira, the comptroller's top lawyer, who said Strayhorn has applied a consistent standard -- and then stuck to it. For any organization to qualify as a religion, members must have "simply a belief in God, or gods, or a higher power," he said.  "We have got to apply a test, and use some objective standards," Ancira said. "We're not using the test to deny the exemptions for a particular group because we like them or don't like them."  Traditional faiths  Since Strayhorn took over in January 1999, the comptroller's office has denied religious tax-exempt status to 17 groups and granted them to more than 1,000, according to records obtained by the Star-Telegram. Although there are exceptions, the lion's share of approvals have gone to groups that appear to have relatively traditional faiths, records show.  But of the denials, at least a fourth include less traditional groups, the records show. In addition to the Denison Unitarian church, the rejected groups include a Carrollton group of atheists and agnostics, a New Age group in Bastrop, and the Whispering Star Clan/Temple of Ancient Wisdom, an organization of witches in Copperas Cove.  Some of the denials occurred because of missing paperwork or other problems, according to the comptroller's office. A few, like the denial for the New Age group and the witches group, were decided because their services were closed to the public, according to documents.  But the denials of the Red River Unitarian Universalist Church in Denison and the North Texas Church of Freethought in Carrollton, as well as an earlier denial by Sharp for the Ethical Culture Fellowship of Austin, were ordered because the organizations did not mandate belief in a supreme being.  The disputed tax dollars don't amount to much, but the comptroller has taken a stand on principle, Ancira said.  "The issue as a whole is, do you want to open up a system where there can be abuse or fraud, or where any group can proclaim itself to be a religious organization and take advantage of the exception?" he said.  Those who oppose the comptroller's "God, gods or supreme being" test say that it can discriminate against legitimate faiths. For example, applying that standard could disqualify Buddhism because it does not mandate belief in a supreme being, critics say.  Opponents note that the federal government applies less stringent rules for federal tax exemptions, yet manages to discourage fraud and abuse. They also question whether the comptroller's office has formulated excuses to discriminate against nontraditional groups, such as those that include witches and pagans.  But Ancira says it's up to the comptroller's office to interpret state law, which he describes as rather vague. He insists the comptroller never favors one religion over another.  "This comptroller, in particular, wants everybody on a level playing field," he said.  'Creedless' religions  The comptroller's office has not always barred "creedless" religions from tax exemption, said Douglas Laycock, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in religious liberty issues.  That standard first came up in 1997, when then-Comptroller Sharp ruled against the Ethical Culture Fellowship of Austin. In making that decision, Sharp overturned the recommendation of his staff.  The Ethical Culture Fellowship sued, claiming that Sharp overstepped his authority. Allied with the group in the ongoing lawsuit are pastors from a broad range of faiths, including Baptists, Lutherans and Mennonites.  Both the lower court and the Texas Supreme Court have ruled against the state's decision. In one opinion, an appeals court said the comptroller's test "fails to include the whole range of belief systems that may, in our diverse and pluralistic society, merit the First Amendment protection."  Strayhorn vows to continue the legal fight to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. "Otherwise, any wannabe cult who dresses up and parades down Sixth Street on Halloween will be applying for an exemption," she said in a April 23 news release.  The Red River Unitarian Universalist Church, the 50-member congregation whose tax application was rejected by Strayhorn's office, has held services in Denison for the seven years. Althoff said his group includes "hard-core atheists" as well as "New Agey-type people."  But the lack of a single creed is a hallmark of Unitarianism, Althoff said. Instead, Unitarian Universalists have seven guiding principles, including "respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part," according to the Unitarian Universalist Web site.  The group also draws from various religious and philosophical traditions, including Jewish, Christian, humanist and Earth-centered teachings, but promotes individual freedom of belief, according to the Web site. It notes that Unitarians and Universalists have operated in the United States for at least 200 years, although the two groups did not merge until 1961.  It now includes about 40 congregations in Texas, and more than 1,000 in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Despite its lack of a specific creed, Unitarian Universalism is as much a religion as any other, Althoff said. From his perspective, religion is not just about the answers to life's big questions, but also calls on people to evaluate the questions themselves.  "It seems to me that any [group] that is specifically organized to address and explore the issues of what constitutes the good life, both here and perhaps in the afterworld, would qualify" as a religion, Althoff said.  The Rev. Anthony David, lead pastor of Pathways Church in Southlake, said he is disturbed by the comptroller's decisions because it ignores Unitarian Universalists' belief that spiritual fulfillment can emerge in "different ways at different levels."  "It reflects an incredible misunderstanding of what a church needs to look like," David said.  Pathways teaches that God is a term that describes the source of ultimate meaning and purpose, but the church does not advocate a one-size-fits-all theology, David said.  "Creedlessness doesn't mean no belief or anything goes," he said.  Craig Roshaven of Fort Worth's First Jefferson Unitarian Universalist Church said he has followed the comptroller's decisions with growing dismay.  His group has tax-exempt status, but he wonders what's to prevent Strayhorn from revoking it.  "The comptroller's logic could be applied to any of us," he said.  Ancira said the comptroller's office has no plans for such reversals. But then again, said Ancira, "There's nothing preventing us from doing so."

      If you want to skip my ranting, simply go to  urlLink this link .   I *HEART* John McCain!   I like John McCain.  Some people think he is nuts. Some people think he is slightly to the right of Satan.  But  I  like John McCain, and that is why I voted for him in the 2000 Michigan Primary, helping to win the state for the maverick pol.  Oh, sure, there was the delight I took in screwing John Engler, who presided over the destruction of many a Michigan institution. And, yes, I enjoyed casting a vote against George "Dumb-as-a-Stump" Bush--I thought the notion of a Bush presidency was scary, even back in 2000 (Bush did, after all, institute a 'faith-based' prison in Texico, with the help of Watergate crook Chuck Colson).  But I like John McCain, and I thought that, if we had to contend with a Republican presidential possibility coming out of the 2000 election, he would do just fine: he is honest, forthright, and certainly not someone I would call 'full of shit' (as I do every person in BushCo, but I digress).  So, when people started floating the notion of a Kerry/McCain ticket, I about wet my pants. This would be a dream ticket, to me. Two Vietnam Vets vs. two draft dodgers. Two true patriots vs. two corporate whores. I was really liking the sound of Kerry/McCain.  (Oh, and I really have a soft spot for underdogs, and McCain is definitely that, being the maverick truth-teller that he is).  Then the flaming began. Dogmatic lefties got their panties in a helluva twist: if McCain is invited, we may as well close up shop and bury the Democratic Party; McCain would destroy the gains made under Roe v. Wade; McCain is a nutcase; it would point to some inherent weakness of all potential Democratic VP wannabees, blah blah blah. You could almost HEAR their Fruits-of-the-Loom being rent asunder as they whipped themselves into a frothy fury, posting agitated blog entries and responses from their laptops and workstations across the US generally and Academia Americana specifically.  Of course, this ticked me off. It really rankled me. Rubbed me the wrong way, you could say. You get the picture--I was royally annoyed. Not just because of my aforesaid respect and admiration of McCain. The lefties were, in their fury, so blinded by their own partisanship that they lost sight of the best part of a Kerry/McCain ticket: this dream team would rip the election from the dirty hands of the Pugs/Neocons, and beat them over their troglodytic skulls with it. Repeatedly, again and again, and then some.  A new CBS  urlLink poll  shows that a Kerry/McCain ticket would trounce Bush/Cheney in an ass-whooping 53%-39% blowout--nearly twice the margin Kerry now enjoys. This supports my claims, made in several blog entries (not that blog entries matter), that such a ticket would only rob support from Bush, leaving Kerry's support base effectively untouched. In other words, it would be a win-win proposal for Kerry.  My brother says I should keep dreaming, as this ticket will never materialize. But I take exception with this. Sure, McCain is a Republican, but there are many tantalizing prospects if he were to accept an invitation to join a "unity ticket."  First, it would give McCain an opportunity to show Bush that paybacks are, indeed, Hell. The Bush campaign savaged McCain in 2000, using various dirty tricks from the Pug rulebook. This included attacking the character of McCain's WIFE. Revenge, they say, is a dish best served cold. I imagine McCain presiding over the Senate wearing a "Kiss the Cook" apron...  Second, speaking of the Senate, as Vice-President, McCain would preside over Senate sessions. While this means little in terms of actual power, it would afford McCain the opportunity to sway opinion and draw focus to his pet causes: campaign finance reform and bringing porkbarrell spending under control. Talk about giving him something satisfying to do with his time as an elder statesman.  Third, McCain is not a Bush Republican. He is a Republican more in the mold of Goldwater, and that means he is, basically, an Honest Conservative (my way of saying his conservativism is in mostly all the right places, and is heartfelt). He is offended that Republicans, now controlling all three branches, are trampling on the Bill of Rights and spending money like drunk sailors. It used to be that Republicans cared about the Constitution and balancing budgets. But these are different times--Clinton/Gore co-opted Republicans on the issue of fiscal responsibility, which had been a cornerstone of Republicanism for decades, and NeoCon Republicans have shown signs of disinterest in the rule of law and the application of the Bill of Rights. To be perfectly honest, I think McCain represents, more and more, the values of the modern Democratic Party than he does the Republican Party. Ronald Reagan, a former Democrat-turned-Republican, used to say that he didn't leave the Democratic Party, but that the Democratic party left  him . One could say the same of McCain and the Republicans.  So, that said, I hope Kerry can read the writing on the wall and calls McCain with a proposition. I hope McCain takes that call and accepts the offer.  Then I can spend the next four-to-eight years saying "I told you so, you blogging bastards."

      Couldn't help it. I am reposting here, on my own blog, a response to some weeping DemmieBabies over at Valuejudgement.org. Of course, the topic is Kerry/McCain!  **************  First, what I responded to:  Post 1: "I think the Democratic Party has done too much trying to beat the Republicans by being like them. They shouldn't try to beat them by being them, either!"  Post 2: "Frankly I wish people would just stop talking about McCain as Veep. (1) it isn't going to happen. (2) because of how exciting a McCain choice sounds and because it isn't going to happen, any choice that Kerry eventually does make will seem disappointing by comparison, and (3) all this talk about McCain feeds into the idea that Democrats are weak as leaders. Why? Because if they weren't they wouldn't have to go looking to a REPUBLICAN to give them legitimacy.  Please Please Please stop talking about McCain!"  And, now, my cogent, even-tempered response:  *******************************************************************  McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain   There, you crybabies.  What's wrong with McCain?  All the arguments against McCain as VP are pissing me off. How does it evidence weakness in the party to invite a Republican to join a unity ticket? Hello?   First: Nothing says strength like inviting a Republican (who, by the way, is unwelcome in the Pug tent), into the big, ol' Democratic tent. Unless you are willing to accept outsiders into the 'tent' you can just shut up and have mommy change your freakin' diapers, babies.  Second, why say it isn't going to happen? Why can't it? Are the Democrats such an exclusive club that they can't embrace a maverick truth-teller and thorn-in-W's-side? I am a lifelong Democrat, and even *I* voted for McCain in the 2000 Michigan Pug primary--if there was going to be a Pug president, I wanted McCain. I respect and admire the man. Sure, he is a Republican, but he sure as shit ain't a PNAC/NeoCon Goober willing to sell the country down the river or outsource it to India like BushCo/HalliburtonAmericahaters, Inc.  Third, stop pissing yourself over McCain making Kerry look dull, or making other potential VPs seem dull by comparison. Look, whether McCain is considered for VP or not, he will always seem exciting and squeaky-clean compared to the boring old men and slick country lawyers some Dems would like to see riding triumphantly with Long Tall Kerry.  If you took the time to READ THE POLL, you would see that Kerry/McCain is a win-win situation: Kerry maintains his current level of support [read: he doesn't lose support, except maybe from pansy Dems who would like to lose with maybe Edwards or (fuck no, god help us) Gephart], and McCain siphons off SHITLOADS of support that might otherwise go to that Smirking Bastard from Crawford, Texas. Hell, a two-veteran ticket assures a win against those two draft-dodging panty-waists. (And I have to ask, what have you weak-kneed sunshine Democrats got against Vietnam Vets?)  Finally, if you really want to screw W, why not let Kerry do it well and truly by beating him over the head with McCain, whom Bush/Rove ungraciously smeared in 2000 (not to mention that they even smeared McCain's wife)?  Look, Democrats are poised to win. I mean, where are Pug strengths anymore? Clinton/Gore co-opted the Republican cornerstone of fiscal responsibility, leaving them without a leg to stand on. The Constitution and international treaties stand in the way of Pug donors, who have their willies so far up BushCo's collective arse that W's mouth smells of urine. The Republican Party has left McCain behind, and he represents, more and more so, the values of the current **Democratic** Party than he does the Pugs.  Of course, you could always start a Draft Zell Miller for VP campaign. After all, he IS a Democrat from the Must-Win South, isn't he?  Sheesh.  Therefore, I say again:  McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain McCain   Now go gum your Gerbers and fill a diaper for Dubya.

      Olsten Staffing Services, my employer, sucks wang and licks ass.  You see, I have been working for Olsten for nearly a year now, and I have exceeded the number of hours they require in order to receive vacation pay.  Oh, but wait. It isn't vacation 'pay.' It is a vacation 'bonus,' which is processed during the first three weeks of January. According to the friendly person at my local office (who placed me on hold while getting all her ducks in a row), this means that, although I meet the requirements for the vacation 'bonus,' I wouldn't actually receive it until January.  Now, what happens if, say, I want to take a vacation in July of 2004? Would I see any vacation 'bonus' in my paycheck then? Oh, no, I wouldn't see it until January of 2005. And what if I am no longer employed by Olsten come January of 2005? Well, then I am screwed.  I am told that this attitude towards their employees is why they didn't make it through the first round of consideration by a large, locally-headquartered bookstore chain.

      ..so I ate a bit, had a bit of Coke, and then took some Tylenol.  And, just when I thought I had it licked, then came the news we'd all been waiting for:  Ronald Reagan is dead.  Well, you'd think the old man could have hung on for the sake of the Party, but I guess some  urlLink October Surprises  are out of the hands of even the mighty GOP.  So let's go over a few items of the Reagan legacy:   urlLink Ketchup as a vegetable : "In 1981, Ronald Reagan's budget director, David Stockman, proposed classifying ketchup as a vegetable as part of Reagan's budget cuts for federally financed school lunch programs (it would make it cheaper to satisfy the requirements on vegetable content of lunches). The suggestion was widely ridiculed and the proposal was killed."   urlLink Iran-Contra/Arms for Hostages : "The Iran/contra affair concerned two secret Reagan Administration policies whose operations were coordinated by National Security Council staff. The Iran operation involved efforts in 1985 and 1986 to obtain the release of Americans held hostage in the Middle East through the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran, despite an embargo on such sales. The contra operations from 1984 through most of 1986 involved the secret governmental support of contra military and paramilitary activities in Nicaragua, despite congressional prohibition of this support."   urlLink Cold War Witchcraft, Baby!  Ronnie was himself a superstitious man. He always carried a lucky charm in his pocket. He knocked on wood, avoided walking under ladders, and made a habit of tossing salt over his left shoulder before each meal. So it shouldn't be surprising that the astrology stuff would appeal to him. Throughout the 1950s, Ron and Nancy sought out the services of Carroll Righter, astrologer to the stars. When Reagan won California's governor seat, he scheduled his inauguration for 12:10 A.M., on Righter's insistence. And in the 1960s, Ron had been consulting with psychic Jeane Dixon over whether to run for President someday.   urlLink I'll drop by for a little Bitburg : Reagan was widely criticized in 1985 for an incident related to an official visit to West Germany. On April 11, the White House announced that Reagan would be visiting the Bitburg military cemetery, to lay a wreath in honor of German soldiers who died in both World Wars. This became controversial when it came to public attention that a small number (variously reported as 49 or 56) of gravesites contained remains of soldiers who had served in Waffen-SS units. Despite protests from various quarters, most notably Elie Wiesel, Reagan proceeded with the visit on the grounds that it would promote reconciliation between the former adversaries.  Retreat and advance: In the spring of 1983, Reagan sent US Marines into Lebanon. Following several smaller bombings, a truck bombing of their barracks killed 241 Marines. Two days later Reagan invaded the tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada. Three months later, Reagan withdrew the Marines from Lebanon.   urlLink MX and match!  From the NYT, October 8, 1981: "President Reagan's decision on the MX missile signals t hat the United States is now firmly and publicly embarked on a first-strike strategic nuclear policy. This is a prescription for nuclear catastrophe, a disaster unparalleled in the history of mankind."  I could go on, but we'll have plenty of opportunities to see it all come out, now that the Gipper is Gone.

      Need I say more? I should have gone camping this weekend so I could escape this onslaught of collective tear-wiping. Not that any camping trip could hope to outlast what is bound to be a lengthy, epileptically-convulsive outbreak of wailing and gnashing of teeth over the death of Ronnie "bombing begins in five minutes" Reagan.  The man was 93. Jesus Christ on Toast, even without Alzheimers, that's pretty damn old. Most of the Great Unwashed, whom he and his cronies shat upon during the course of the "Reagan Revolution," don't even approach that golden era of of senescence; if they do, they sure as Hell don't get waited on hand-and-foot, sponge-bathed, and spoon-fed as he did to the bitter end. Now, we must stand fast as we get bombarded by a continuous, looping stream of weeping woe--not that anyone should be shocked by it: we were all prepared when Congress renamed National Airport after the man who fired the striking air traffic controllers. I wonder, though, if there will be more than five minutes, in the course of the next week, devoted to more than a superficial aside noting the Beirut bombing, or the 'liberation' of Grenada, or Iran-Contra, or his and Nancy's astrological bent. Or, how about his divorce from Jane Wyman--family values, anyone? And what of his role in driving the Hollywood red scare? Certainly we won't hear about how he spent us into record deficits--the model, apparently, for the coke-addled dry drunk now at the helm of the ship of state.  No, we'll likely see a barrage of neo-soviet, sepia-toned film clips from his radio days, or of good old Ronnie slapping Gorbie's back, to the sound of  "...tear down this wall!" Assuming, of course, that the talking heads at Fox News can stop weeping long enough to speak through their silk handkerchiefs and introduce the clips, or that the goons at CNN can stop doing backflips trying to appear appropriately solemn and respectful in order to do the same. The pundits and perpetual 'analysts' (new-speak for 'former government official on the make-work circuit') will be present, as always, spouting maudlin homilies to their old boss, and there will be calls to chisel his gob into the remaining free space of Mount Rushmore, or, barring that, simply altering a current mug therein to match his wrinkled countenance. They might even float the idea of scarring his image onto the surface of the moon--all the better for those spooky Halloween nights in the future. No doubt someone will want to put him on, say, the dollar bill--although it would be more appropriate to splatter him on the $1,000 bill, that note being far more convenient for the purpose of his worshippers' daily reminiscing. At least we can count on there being no Ronald Reagan University, as Nancy put the kibosh on THAT movement--for the time-being.  Ah, the rich irony of all those yet-to-be-built-or-renamed elementary schools. They will bear the name of the man whose administration once toyed with counting the ketchup in their fatty, school-lunch burgers as a vegetable (and, no, I won't go into the great government cheese giveaway of 1981).  For, you see, I could go on ad nauseum, but I will instead leave that to the "Liberal" media.  Enjoy the show.

      A letter sent to the Trustees of the Salem-South Lyon Distrisct Library, my former employer.  Also cc'd to my former boss, the current Library Director.  Enjoy!  ****************************************  President Nulty and members of the Board,  It is with no small measure of satisfaction that I note that the Board has seen fit to adopt an adequate pay schedule for the Network position, in line with one that I personally recommended to Interim Director Hannon in the Summer of 2002.  At the time, I had been employed as "Computer Coordinator" for four years, with responsibilities and expectations equal to those of my fellow computer staffers at other Library Network-affiliated libraries--people both with and without degrees in Computer Science. However, after four years, the pay for my own position lagged some twelve thousand dollars below the starting pay at comparable TLN libraries. Director Hannon was aware of this fact as early as the 2000/2001 budget year--at the time I was actively researching this matter in pursuit of a more equitable accommodation of my own efforts. As Assistant Director, Mrs. Hannon was aware of the discrepancy, being in charge, at the time, of what one might refer to as the "human resources portfolio," which is why I brought the matter to her attention personally. My concerns were passed on to the Director, Nancy Noble, at that time, by Assistant Director Hannon, and this fact was related to me by Mrs. Noble herself.  Following the appointment of Mrs. Hannon, upon Mrs. Noble's retirement, as Interim Director, I again brought the matter to the Interim Director's attention. Mrs. Hannon, seeing the obvious dissatisfaction with my circumstances, assured me that she would bring the matter to the attention of the Board of Trustees, and I took her at her word. This was in July of 2002, and given the urgency I felt I had conveyed to her, I expected some measure of accommodation during that slow period of Board activity. I had provided her with my documented research and left the matter in her responsibility and care. Thus, assuming that there would be a good faith effort on the Interim Director's part, I allowed the matter to rest with her while I tended to my duties. Mrs. Hannon had shown an eagerness to accommodate staff members under similar circumstances during her tenure as Assistant Director, and I assumed I would be extended no less than this same courtesy.  Thereupon followed no less than two successive Board meetings wherein the matter was, in distinct point of fact, not brought to the attention of the Board.  There also followed, then, my annual review in October of 2002, wherein I was stunned at Mrs. Hannon's statement which opened the proceedings, to wit: "I said I would take it [my salary request] to the Board--I didn't say when." I was, in a word, flabbergasted.   Flabbergasted, no less so, due to the bonus fact that Board policy regarding employee reviews was entirely dispensed with in the case of my review (I was provided, in advance, neither the forms nor the procedures which would govern my review). In light of both this and an active and palpable disrespect of me amongst the administrative staff (fostered by Mrs. Hannon's actions, or lack thereof, either actively or passively), I found myself in a distinctly unpleasant and untenable position, and I found that the only satisfactory resolution would be resigning my position, specifically, and terminating my employment, generally, with the library.  While leaving my employment under the prevailing economic conditions of the time was, to say the least, unpleasant, leaving behind the atmosphere of self-aggrandizement and active disrespect of the administrative staff has never once entered my mind as a regrettable action.  The adoption of an appropriate pay scale for the computer/network position--in line with precisely that which I promoted with then-Interim Director Hannon--might be a Phyrric victory of sorts, but I derive no end of satisfaction to see that my recommendations, vis-a-vis a commensurate pay scale for the position, have more-or-less been adopted by the Board.  Sincerely,  Paul Taylor

      The Supreme Court proved that there is nary a spine amongst all nine of the doddering old hacks, in ruling today that Michael Newdow's challenge to the Pledge of Allegiance, or, more specifically, the little part that declares the nation to be "Under God," did not have legal standing. Newdow is a non-custodial parent, suing on behalf of his daughter, who lives with her mother, a born-again Christian.  The Supremes decided that, being non-custodial, Newdow has no standing in the case. Could it be coincidental that they announced this heroic acheivement on Flag Day, and also the 50th anniversary of "Under God?" By non-custodial, I mean they found that he did not have "SUFFICIENT custody" to qualify as her legal representative.  This seems to raise many interesting questions.  First, how is it that the Supremes seem to know something that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals apparantly does not? To wit: the fine line they are able to discern which separates Newdow from being able to represent his daughter--his biological offspring--or not being able to do so. If a man with limited custody--ten days a month--can be precluded from legally representing his child, where does the line for child support get redrawn?  "Your honor, I contend that, having no relationship with the mother or the child, and having no history of custody or visitation, I do not have the legal responsibility to support said child. The Supreme Court said as much, in ruling against Michael Newdow."  It would seem that in today's society, our judges should be doing all they can to encourage the familial bond between father and child, rather than driving a wedge between them. You can bet your sweet ass that, were Newdow trying to avoid support payments (I do not know if he has that obligation, by the way), there is no court in the land that would have--until today--accepted the legal argument that he didn't have sufficient custody to support an argument against support (so to speak).  But what were we to expect from the Supremes? They don't give a good god-damn about Parental Rights, Voter Rights, or the Bill of Rights, for that matter. They didn't want to piss off the Christian establishment that they bowed to in handing the election to Bush in 2000. The controlling interests on the court are neoconservative fundamentalists and/or Papists who would just as soon see a Christian theocracy in America as support an athiest father's attempt to have some say in the raising of his daughter.  I could say more, but it is hard to read the screen while shaking my head in disbelief and disgust at those nine weasels. They are, as Letterman once said (about lawyers, generally), "The biggest weasels in all of Weaseldom."

      A little less than a month ago, I had my car in for a clutch replacement at the local greasemonkey shop in South Lyon. I won't name names, but they are located downtown and are often the target of angry letters to the South Lyon Herald regarding the volume of cars waiting for repairs, a storage problem which is evident to all who pass.  So, yeah, they replaced my clutch. I chose to go with them because they had the cheapest estimate (will I EVER learn my lesson?). Unlike other shops, who would have lifted the engine up and out of the car, this particular shop would approach matters from below. Their approach necessitated unbolting certain parts on the left underside (this is an important clue) of the engine compartment. The car was ready within a few days, and I was (relatively) happy.  This Tuesday past, the car gave up the ghost in a strange, new manner. As I was turning right onto the last stretch of my trip home from work--rush hour, don't ya know--there came a grinding and what-all from underneath the front of the car, which came to a, well, grinding, halt.  The car would NOT budge. Upon closer inspection (cursory, for the traffic denied a lengthy inspection at my leisure), I noted that the left fromt tire was very intimately trying to associate itself with the front of its wheel well.  Hmm... Left front wheel... Hmmm...  To make a long story short, after waiting an hour, the tow truck arrived from its home a half mile away, and car and owner were whisked home. Upon my arrival thence, the driver took inquisitive and lifted the front end in order to peep the underworkings. Much to the surprise of us both (myself moreso, but that is to be expected), he announced that a bolt was missing from the lower ball joint of the wheel/axle assembly.  Apparantly, said bolt was not properly tightened (or replaced?) during the previous repair.  I am, as you might say, pissed. The car is BACK at the negligent shop, and I am awaiting word on the diagnosis and estimate. I anticipate the shop will deny all culpability, despite the evidence pointing a big finger at them and shouting "J'accuse!" I do not look forward to, but expect, having to explain to them just WHY they shouldn't expect me to pay one red cent. Perhaps I will have to tell them to suck it up and be glad I wasn't killed on the highway when their handiwork chose to freeze up the machinery.  I hate being bound to a car. I miss living where a bike was my conveyance. Sigh.

      Weekend spent with a screw in the tire. Fear to venture forth. No shops open til Monday.   'Nuf said.   And now, a list of groups BushCo hates:    urlLink Firefighters    urlLink Blacks &nbsp;(protesting ones, the quiet ones are ok)  The French (well, duh)  Trial lawyers (those who aren't with them, but agin' 'em)   urlLink Smart people   Northerners (except red state Northerners)  Muslims  Non-religious persons   Find your own links if I didn't supply them. Lord knows there is enough reporting out there, if you avoid the mainstream, 'liberal' media.   Items for which BushCo could/should be collectively&nbsp;frog-marched:   War crimes in Iraq (the illegal war)  American deaths for foreign oil interests (lies for oil)  Cheneyburton  Energy policy meetings  Abdicating foreign policy to the PNAC punks  The Plame outing  The Chalabi mugging (treason and abdicating oath of office)  Openly courting churches into the election campaign  The Yellowcake debacle  The PATRIOT Act   Ack. Time to get back to FedEx-ing documents.
