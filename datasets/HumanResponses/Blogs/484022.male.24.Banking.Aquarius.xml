      Just the other day I thought to myself, "Mmmmm...I could really go for a gut box."  So I decided to create Gut Box Online, where we can all hang out, even if it's a virtual hangout.  So, just post what you feel like - talk about sports, good articles, pictures, whatever.  My thinking is that at the very least we'll have a place to laugh at each other...even more than we do now...

      As usual, good times in Belgrade Lakes, Maine.&nbsp; The Sunset Grille never changes, and neither do its patrons.&nbsp; A good time was had by all as we celebrated my 21st early on Friday.&nbsp; A local band (few of my buddies) came out and we jammed to a crowd in the lobby.&nbsp; Good times smoking Cuban cigars, having the occasional Purple Hooter, and just having fun in general.&nbsp; Check out the few pictures I have, hopefully more to follow.&nbsp;   HIGHLIGHTS&nbsp;OF THE WEEKEND:    My brother James gave me an embroidered that says:&nbsp; Matthew's 21st in&nbsp;Belgrade Lakes, ME - Raise your glass to all that came.  Karaoke at the Grille on Saturday.&nbsp; I sang  Mack the Knife ,  Baby Got Back  (which I dedicated to "those who couldn't come"), and  Jenny(867-5309) .&nbsp;  Connor, aka Frank the Tank,&nbsp;lost in a beer chugging contest&nbsp;with a girl!&nbsp; Actually, that was pretty odd, and her friend poured some beer on him...go figure.  Crazy drunk lady followed us home...kind of freaky...  Texas Hold 'Em, everyday!&nbsp; I won once, ended up +$10 on the weekend.&nbsp; Duda was the big winner after he scored the $200 pot on Sunday.&nbsp;   Keg of Michelob Light.&nbsp; Not quite Killians, but we all know what that does to people...we really don't need any holes in the wall...  Jamming on  Feelin' Alright  with Ludwin and Eli.&nbsp; Rocked out tune.  The numerous random Old School quoting, like when Ludwin popped in on Duda and I around 3 a.m. and yelled, "Hey everybody, we're going streaking!&nbsp; C'mon.....we're going streaking down through the quad!"   Quality stuff.&nbsp;  urlLink Check out the pics here .

      Another fun-filled, action-packed day here at Florida's Most Convenient Bank....staring at signature cards all afternoon while answering phone calls from people who should know the answers to their questions already.  I've come to the conclusion that Bill Engvall is correct. Stupid people  should  have to wear signs that say "I'm Stupid" (or in my case identify themselves over the phone).   I'm waiting with baited breath for football season to start. I've got a rabid Fins fan here in the department, who I can't wait to start talking trash to when they start their November slide. We should have some fun October when the J-E-T-S, JETS, JETS, JETS! come to town...  I'm getting a little antsy over the day-to-day battle for the NL East lead between  four  teams. These teams either need to start winning some games and make a run for it, or they need to just quit. I can't take this four-way race for much longer. At least four of the teams in that division are competitve, which is more than I can say for their AL counterparts - no offense meant to those of you who follow the O's and the Sox, but until either some team&nbsp;takes the crown from the 'Axis of Evil', or Satan himself comes to&nbsp;take his team back to the nether-regions, that division will never be competitive.  I have two favorite teams in baseball: the Mets and whoever is playing the Yankees.  For those of you in Tally, my family and I are going to try to plan a trip up there to see a game sometime in October or November probably. Looking forward to possibly seeing everyone. If anyone is in the South Florida area, give me a call: (561) 339-4903.

      I just got here to Maine, and my aunt Janet and aunt Linda go, "Hey, your birthday gift is in the fridge!"&nbsp; I open the white fridge to find two cases of Killian's Red.&nbsp; All for me.&nbsp; My  MOM  ordered the keg for Friday night!&nbsp; Uncle Nick picked out the beer!&nbsp; Dad brought two cigars to have a celebratory smoke.&nbsp; Truly, the best family a guy could ask for.

      That's right.&nbsp; I know you can all remember the dude in the big velvet hat sliding across the room.&nbsp; Don't deny it - you liked that song.&nbsp;   Anyway, things are just about as busy as possible, between trips to Haiti, Maine, and Vermont (Phish!) and the incredble amount of business, I just can't keep up.&nbsp; Lest we forget July 28th, my birthday.&nbsp;   Got to hang with the Aces on Sunday evening,&nbsp;and I brought up some of the Cohibas I had acquired in Haiti.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; I must say, their house is quite nice, and Ace gets MAD PROPS for the 50 in. TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Leaving for Maine tomorrow - big party Friday, and it's Boyz Weekend, so it will be crazy.  Keep your eyes posted&nbsp;for pictures from Haiti - I'll post them up as soon as I get them formatted.

      All -     Words can't really describe the situation here.  Justin, my friend and boss, managed to put together a nice piece on our actual day, and hopefully it will give you all a good idea of what we're going through down here.

      Just a snapshot of some of the crazy animals people have as pets here in Palm Beach County...no wonder these people couldn't figure out how to use a voting machine...  The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office was searching this afternoon for a tiger that escaped from a private residence in Loxahatchee.  The big cat was reported missing around 3 p.m. from a residence in the 3600 block of C Road, sheriff's office spokesman Paul Miller said.  The sheriff's helicopter was searching from the air while other specialists searched on the ground.  I wonder how much these "specialists" got paid...or how much experience they really have. Did they just get Billy and Joe Bob out there with their hunting gear (can't forget that safety orange vest)?  ...here's your sign...

      I'm here at the hotel.  I'd like you all to try and imagine a place with thousands of people hanging out in the streets, shanty towns, no street lights, no stop signs, and crazy people driving.  Our driver (an ex-secret service agent) basically helped us avoid death on multiple occasions.  The mountains here, however, are incredible.  The views are the stuff of traveler's dreams.  The hotel is nice, and I am getting a box of Cuban cigars tomorrow.  I'm basically in between excited, afraid, and tired.  Oh, I forgot - the airline lost our luggage, and it won't be here until tomorrow.  Good job American Airlines...

      That's right kids... Spence finally got blogger to fix whatever the hell was keeping me away from the Gut Box (makes me wonder if Erin is trying to keep me away from anything Guthrie's related...  just kidding... she loves that little hell-hole of great food as much as I do... well almost as much.)  As far as the poker fad goes... it is fun to see everyone starting to catch on to it, makes it much easier to get a game and to take stupid people's money...  Now if I could just figure out when I have some time to actually play...    Four - good luck in Haiti man.  Remember, tell your captors whatever they want to hear.  They'll go easier on you.

      Not much going on here. I just moved into my new cubicle at work and am staring at 3 and a half blank walls. I starting to feel like I'm in "Office Space"...on a brighter note, I'm earning over $15k more than I was a year ago, so I shouldn't really be complaining, should I?  Watching Celebrity Poker Showdown makes me long for the old poker nights and actaully has peaked my interest in Hold'em....but I still miss those boo pots

      That's right - I'm leaving Sunday for 6 days in Haiti.  I'll be working for ComCEL, a division of Western Wireless International, LLC.  We're implementing their POS system, with a new integration NTG is designing for activation and tracking of ESNs.  I'm staying at the  urlLink Villa Creole Hotel , which has satellite TV and high speed internet, even in the "standard" rooms.    I really don't know why this trip seems so exciting - most people freak out when I tell them where I'm going.  Guess I just love the thrill of possibly being kidnapped.

      Finally saw  T3  last night.  Not bad, especially since I was watching it with my dad and everytime Ahnold came on screen he went "it's the Gubernator!"  He thought it was funny the 500th time he did it, I didn't...  One movie I have marked on my calender as a no-miss is  Anchorman .  I mean, how could anyone pass that one up?  Will Ferrell is simply comic genius.  The bottom line is who else can say  "I wrote this song about the time I killed a drifter to get an erection"  and make you laugh?    Finally, the big day is approaching...July 28th.  Spence, I saved the margarita set you gave me for Christmas, and I am busting it out that day.  Should be a  good time...

      I think I should enter the World Series of Poker, considering I won $130 this past weekend in 3 separate games of Texas Hold 'Em.  If anyone would like to sponsor my $10,000 entry fee, please let me know.    In other news, the 4th of July weekend was great.  Lobster, beer, boating, hot tub, poker, cigars...couldn't have been any better.  Heading off to Haiti on Sunday.  If anyone would like any cool stuff, give me ideas.  One definite:  a box of ::cough:: Dominican cigars.

      Just thought I'd let everyone know I just trounced my family in Texas Hold 'Em for a solid $40.  Managed to get my father all-in, and then pulled an flush on the river that beat out his inside straight.  Figured my poker mentors would be proud...bring on Chan...

      Made it back up to Maine today, and I'll be here till Tuesday.  I love relaxing up here, and the Fourth of July is a special time.  Of course, the Sox just lost 3 in a row to the Yanks and it looks like the D-Rays are gonna overtake us for 2nd place in the AL East.  Someone shoot me now.  Anyway, tomorrow night is karaoke night at the "Grille", and I do believe there will be some songs to sing...I gotta thow down some Lebanese tradition...

      It has become very apparent to me that I like my dog, like I like taking a crap - I would go without it if I could, but because it is already there, I really appreciate it at times.  Except the times when it comes out messy and without form, which I do not enjoy.  I always thought my dog's name was just a big joke but it turns out that it fits him perfectly.  I look forward to getting an underground fence at my new home and watching my little JackAce learn the fence limits over and over again - maybe it'll be like Electric-Shock Therapy and he'll calm down a bit.  Doubtful.  He's biting me right now . . . I just bit him back.  I'm glad dogs don't have souls, because I would hate to think my dog would be going to hell.  Don't get me wrong though, I love my little JackAce - I just feel there's room to love him more.  I've heard a puppy is good training for a baby.  I hope not.  Hello All.

      As I sit here at 11:48 CDT, waiting for the IT resource from ComCEL to showup (he was supposed to be here at 9 a.m.), I can hear 50 Cent wafting up from the street with one twist - it's a French version of "In 'Da Club".  Speaking of music, I'm looking forward to the Phish concert next week.  In northern Vermont, and called "Coventry", it's a four day campout/concert which is the final performance of my favorite band.  I have a feeling it'll be the greatest show I've ever seen. Yes, even better than Billy Joel/Elton John, although I bet Spence and Ace are shaking their heads.   Hope all is well back home....wish I was there....

      Not really sure what to think about the four-way deal that sent Nomar to the Cubs and gave us Cabrera and Mientkiewicz.  Part of me is sad to see the guy go - he's always been a personal favorite.  However, sitting out that game at Yankee stadium a few weeks back, turning down the Sox's offer of a 4 year, $60 million dollar deal, begins to make me doubt his passion and loyalty.   Of course the sting might still have been there after the failed A-Rod deal, but Manny has dealt with it pretty well, and that happened  after  Nomar turned down the original offer, which was pretty generous considering his second half production was pitiful.  Thoughts, anyone?
