      Hey! Just want you to know that at this very moment...I'm really starving! (craving for food!) ahh!!! Anyways, I'm here to share some stories. It's basically about me and baguio! Ok, how will I start?! *think*think* (I'm still starving. Mom, where are you?! I need food!!!) ok, I can't think properly eh, cause of my growling stomach. :) Anyways, let me start the story... I tell you this is really a looonnnggg story. Don't tell me you were not warned...this is partly detailed... BELIEVE ME :)  May 17-19, 2004             CAMPUS HARVEST ASIA @ BAGUIO!!!  May 16, 2004 The night before the campus harvest! I attended the 5 pm service. we (my dad, mom, bro and me!) were late coz we ate dinner early. he3! Hungry people! Anyways, after the service, Leanne and I went to Odyssey to buy some video tapes for the campus harvest. They ate dinner (I'm still full). They watched Troy!. We watched Jersey Girl (the movie is not really what I expected it to look like). Waited in the Victory Center. Stayed there till 12 mn. Went straight to Seattle's best to wait for our bus (Victory Liner :). Played taboo with (Kuya) Francis, Nikki, Roni, Nikki R., Reg, Athens, Bojo. Waited till 2 am. Alas! The bus came. We rode and slept.  May 17, 2004  Inside the bus. My seatmate was Nikki. Slept. Woke up at 8:30 am. We were in BAGUIO!!! Near the vacation house. Others were still sleeping. It was so cold. Went down the bus with our baggages. Stayed at DIAMOND VACATION HOUSE. My roommates were: Nikki, Bethel, Gail, Sam and Kay. Hang out. Ordered food from KFC. T'was like 10 years after, the food arrived. hehehe! They took so long. I ordered one piece chicken and a regular mashed potato (hungry!!!). Went to CAP-Camp John Hay for our first session. We stayed at the back. It was hot. We didn't experience the confetti falling and the balloons. Our first session was with Pastor Gilbert. Nice Preaching. We went to SM BAGUIO. They bought some stuffs. Ate at Mcdo. Went home. Slept.  May 18, 2004 I woke up early @ around 4:00 am. Took a bath. It was freezing cold. Found (Kuya) Francis sleeping in our couch. Had my quiet time. Ate breakfast (pancakes with whipped cream, corned beef, spicy tuna c/o Bethel and Charie) hehehe! Went to CAP for our other sessions. Planned to have good seats (uhm, actually we kinda had good seats in the morning). Our first session in the morning was with Pastor Dennis. Very funny guy. He's so good at imitating other people. With his bushy eyebrows and small eyes. hehehe! Next was with Pastor Manny. We were sleepy. Tired. Tried not to sleep but my eyes were so heavy. (FYI:I didn't sleep). We had our break. Ate at Dencio's. Ate Sisig and the not so cooked chicken. Hanged out. Took some pics. Went back to CAP.  Had our next sessions with Pastor Mark and Pastor Ferdie. We had our break again. Stayed at the Filling Station. I slept while the other YOF Alabang ate their burgers, small doughnuts, played with their cameras, took some shoots. We went back quite early. It was raining hard. We were soaking wet (just kiddin'). Rode the jeep. Payed 2 pesos. Thanks to James, he payed for our fare!!! Had a plan how to have good seats (it was kinda good!!!). But it didn't quite work. YOF Alabang were scattered. But praised and worshipped altogether. Yeah!!!. In our place, it was like 4 seats with 4 or 5 people on it. We were squeezed but it was fun. Had our last two sessions for the day with Pastor Jim. The Word was great! There was total silence. We sung and danced. Went home I believe. Talked. Hang out. Slept. It was a long day. Agree?!?!?! :)  May 19, 2004 Woke up at 4:00 or 4:30 am. Took a bath. Had my quiet time. Ate breakfast. Went to CAP for our last session with Pastor Rico. Cool. Funny. I really like the Word. We sung, danced with all our might coz its the last day of the Campus Harvest. But still, we have an extra day to tour the place and hang out. After the session, we went to SM BAGUIO, ate at Popeye's, we didn't pay! hehehe! YOF treat! Praise God! After we ate, went to Mines View. Took pictures. Shopped. I shopped with Gail coz she's my buddy! hehe! We have our buddies so as not to be lost and to keep on track with our spiritual family!!! hehehe!!! I had this very funny experience. hehe! We bought pasalubongs (choco flakes, pinipig, bags and other stuffs). We forgot to make tawad. hehehe! We bought a bag, mine is red and Gail bought the black one. hehehe! Ok, I'll tell you the story... We went to one of the stores that sells bags, I asked the tindera how much, she told me 80 pesos, Gail told me to make tawad, and with full confidence, I told the tindera "pwede po ba 75 nalang?!" and Gail was like ok... you made tawad with 5 pesos lang?! It was so weird. My brain was not working at that time eh... hehehe!!! We missed the jeepney but they went back. While walking, all my stuff fell!!! hahaha!!! my reaction?! I just laughed and laughed and laughed!!! hahaha! They helped me. Thanks. We went to the palengke. I didn't buy anything coz I'm tired and I don't wanna buy anything. Went to ukay-ukay, some went, but others stayed in the jeep (that includes me!). Went home. Hang out. Ate (nakakamay!!!) lotsa food. Played catch phrase. Laughed. hahaha!!! What a night. :)   May 20, 2004 Woke up at around 7 am. Planned to jog but there was a problem (i don't wanna expound on that). Took a bath. Had my quiet time. Ate breakfast. Hang out. Played. Laughed. After lunch, went to Adeng's house. We had our lunch there (lotsa food mhan!!! tell me about it!!!). They played Killer. I slept. The guys played grappling or whatever you call it. Played charades. Ate hotdogs and drunk chocolate. Went home at around 8:30 pm. Packed our things. Hang out. Laughed. The bus arrived at around 11 pm. Aboard the bus. Went home. Slept. Arrived Alabang (Caltex) around 6 am. Bye! Baguio!...  My story ends here... But the memories will be kept, and being a campus minister is just beginning!!! Kahmown!!!

      Hmm... my classes started 3 weeks ago. It's been quite okay, I guess. I don't have any problems...yet. :) Well, this is the only extra time I have to visit my blog (I don't have classes coz our teachers are having their retreat). Uhm, FYI: my dad's not here, he's in the states because there was a tragedy happened... I don't want to tell... I'm getting too emotional... SOB! Anyways, I'm over it already, my dad will be back on July 11. And I told him to have pasalubong for me... :) that's the good part. Back to the topic, my senior year is really weird. I have weird teachers (not really weird, I just find them though...) For English class, we have to memorize one shakespeare sonnet (its only 14 lines so its ok) -no duplication (there are hundreds of them so its also ok), we have to have our book report(Bestseller-no dulication) by monday--June 28 (which is not so ok). And we'll study about Greek Mythology, Yeah!!! My sched is alright. My classmates are alright though we're not that close yet. My adviser looks ok :). My grades are doing fine?! he3! Breakthrough! My brain is working on a normal mode again! coz since classes started, my brain went really weird, it's not functioning well... I'm like: what's that?! how did it come up with that answer?!(Algeb) Huh?!(Algeb) Ahh... I get it...(Algeb) again...(Algeb) hehehe... I used to like Algeb a lot. But these past weeks were not my weeks... my brain and algeb don't jive together... ;) But now, I do understand it! yeah! And last week, I can't bend my left arm coz it did hurt badly (PE Classes), we had our PPFT (Philippine Physical Fitness Test)--from curl-ups, arm span, sitting height, chest pass, sit and reach, standing long jump to the dreaded... PUSH-UPS! Yes! You read it right! PUSH-UPS! name it we have it! I did 50 push-ups... which is not normal because the average is only 40... I went overboard... hahaha! my arm is ok now. what else?!, we had our paraliturgy a.k.a. senior meeting underground! very exciting! hahaha! blame it all to Karen! hahaha! nothing much exciting about my first month as a senior... got a lot of work to do... especially that El Fili thingie... I have to summarize 5 chapters... believe it.... hahaha! ok, well then... bye!

      hmm... 1st quarter is almost over... we're just waiting for the final exams. My brain's not funtioning well... AGAIN! I just find it weird. I failed our Economics quiz... yup! I failed, not really failed, I got half of the the total items. What happened?! I WAS MENTAL BLOCK! too bad.. the test was quite easy, infact, many of my classmates got a pefect score! Then, me?! hahaha! half! what a quiz... tsk3! I just pray that I can cope with the lessons soon... I want my brain back to NORMAL! I repeat... BACK TO NORMAL! Maybe, my mind is still adjusting but, does my brain had enough time to adjust?! weird. This week was also not that good for me, I find out the results of my tests... I'm not satisfied with it! Man! I'm not normal!!! Last wednesday... things went the way it shouldn't be... I left our Research Project in our corridor, I bumped my head somewhere, I had colds, My paper bag slipped, and blah, blah, blah... hahaha! so amazing! Can you believe it happened in a day?!... my goodness! but I'm ok na. It really happens... for me?! a lot of times... but they're just trials... it's just annoying sometimes, because I've had enough... and it still happening... It will pass soon... I hope!... hehehe...
