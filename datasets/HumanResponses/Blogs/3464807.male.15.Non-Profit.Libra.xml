      It's late... yea... my Aunt Moura, Uncle Carl, and cousin Ryan came over today... that was cool... hung out with pat and tim today... we went to friendlyz but it was to crowded so we walked to the mall and then back to my house... i brought a cool shirt... i started watching Ghandi, cause i got to do a report on it.. so far its a pretty good piece of cinema... I don't know if the mets one or lost today... hmm.... I'm tired... Rebellion and individualism is cool, but its just so easy to conform... the Red Sox lost today.. that fills me with sadness... People like Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Babe Ruth, Jimi Hendrix, Mozart, Shakespeare, and The Beatles will live forever, but my life will be nothing but an insignificant, worthless speck of dirt in the eyes of time... Two more weeks of school... damn... to far away.... My gunea pig has gotten old, and his feet have swollen to like twice their normal size... its quite sad... Today I figured out that it is approxiamtly a little over four miles to pats house from mine... if i woke both ways thats like eight miles a day... the pounds will melt right off... but then theres the matter of controlling my eating, and i really have no self disciplin.. thats really the cause of my current condition... I need to get a job... unfortunatly I lack work ethic, an supposedly, thats "important" to they employers... I find it funny that the common man thinks they have all the solutions to the world... People think that if they were president, the world would be so much better then it is today, but come on, these people with all the "solutions" to the worlds problems would probably send the world into a state of chaos and disorganization with their unrealistic, uneducated views... not that I'm saying I'm a bush fan... why does the average man think that HE ALONE has somehow figured out how to solve world hunger or bring about peace in the middle east... If the solution was THAT simple and THAT obvious, wouldn't someone else with a higher IQ came up with it first then some everyday yahoo who spends more time surfing the internet for porn then searching for a job (in other words- Pat Denahan)... i personalyl wouldn't want to be president.. to much work and responsibility and all that "real world" crap... why is it always about me... all i ever talk about is ME, Me, Me,... am i to self involved?.... For those reading who think I am vain or egotistical, i actually have shockingly low selfesteem... When I right in my journal at night, i tend to babble... wow... its now 2:08, a full forty mintues after I began... after further review of the yellowcard cd, I think i may have been a little harsh about it.. their pretty good... Pat Denahan is a man whore for attention

      Still not much to talk about in my life... had a guitar lesson today... we worked on Jazz and improvisation.... yea.. mets are losing... goddamn.... Jose Reyes can't stay healthy... hes like 20 years old and he hurt his legs like five times in the past year... and now he hurt his back.. dammit.... Mets just officailly lost... three day weekend... party at petes... I might go to India with my dad over the summer... He's going for business but he said he might take me... I wanan see the world.. and India seems like a a good enough place to start... New Delhi.... Two weeks of school left... While I'm looking forward to the summer, and I would like it to be a party summer, It looks like its gonna be boring... yup... I've decided to lose wieght, I'm gonna walk everday over the summer... It's probably like four miles from my house to pats house or something like that, so that would probably take like and hour and a half to walk or womethign like that.. not very good at estimating things... ummm... I like walking... Bad Bloods comin along, could be a good Paperview.... I'm watching FUSE and Jets playing "Cold Hard Bitch".. Jets pretty good, an nice solid rock band.... ALcoHol.... yup.... One of my favorite songs is Mr. Blue Sky.. damn that song is uplifting... If I could have one song running through my head all the time, like if that was some kinda mental disorder that you just heard one song over and over again, I'd choose Mr. Blue Sky cause then I'd be a happy crazy person... Wow, this whole post is utterly devoid of meaning and purpose... .... ... yea

      O.K... this is the first real fucking entry.... Today was boring.. i really shouldn't have a blog cause nothign really exciting happens to me, therefor, there is nothing to write about.... I'm bored... Download "Drain You" by Nirvana... its a great song... Mets are winning... I should get into hardcore drugs just for the wieght lost benifits... If you said Mallet and you had a cold, it might sound like ballet... I brought the Yellowcard C.D. today... after hearing "Ocean Avenue". i thought the cd would be a little more pop punk, which i have an affinity for, but it was like half pop punk, half emo.. so it was a bit dissapointing... is my life pointless... apparantly not if I'm still writing this.... and with that I'm out

      yea... its today  I noticed the other day that I live life through books, movies, tv... fictional people and characters... i have no life of my own... no real identity... this kinda worrys me  The Great American Bash is tonight... should be a good PPV... a decent card  this last week has been real boring... didnt do anything worthwhile or productive... probably should  I wanna see Farenhiet 9/11... it looks real interesting... im not a fan of bush  I'm listening to Sgt. Pepper... nota bad album  When I'm 64  Met-Yankee series is in progres... Mets lost today, the first game of the double header, but they won yesterday... so tonite we shall see who takes the series   Today i woke up at 8 15 and went to 9 00 mass at church... then we went out to breakfast at country kitchen.. good pancakes... then i came back home and went to sleep until 2:30  "In life, one must choose between suffering and boredom", i got this qoute from the sopranoes, meadow was qouting some philopher or something from the post WWII era... i like it  Six billion is a really big number  I fought the Law and the law won  yea I'd say I'm done

      Ok... its about a week since i updated  Global and bio regents went by without complications.. both seemingly easy  summers here.. that makes me happy...   My name is steve connolly and im not ashamed  Wow.. my life is devoid of meaning  MR. Jones is a good song So, is good riddance  I'm accidentaly in love  Pass me a bottle Mr. Jones  Nothing exciting happened this week, so im gonna taolk about nothing  Smiling in the bright lights When everybody love you you can never be lonely  You can see a million miles tonite but you can't get very far  We all want to be big big stars but We all got different reasons for that  I wanna be someone who believes  MR. Jones  I'm an interesting character  I want an american girl  American girls

      Ok... I'm not sure how long its been since I wrote but this last fucking week of school... goddammit.. one fucking week, seems petty and insignificant... one would call it small... but jesus christ every second is a minute and every minute is an hour latly  Music is cool... I went to best buy and brought myself two new c.d's- 1) Films about Ghost, best of counting crows 2) The best of Sublime, new mellenium collection... I brought these cds with the intention of getting into these bands,  giving the fact that I liked the counting crows song from Shrek 2 and some I stole via music piracy and I liked date rape from sublime... BUT FUCKING WOW, HOLY SHIT, counting crows are fucking awesome... on the cd of sixteen songs i enjoy fifteen, and i think when i have a nice cash flow ill go out and buy another album of them... sublime was ok.. alittle bit of a let down..  Mets are one game under .500, and their losing right now... trashel gave up back to back home runs.. one of them was a three runner... guess which one... yankees are doing real hot latly... first place... real hot streak  I mowed my lown today... it was hot out... that kinda sucked  Last day of classes is Friday... St. Anthonys is off... how nice of there school to give them their finals this week so they could take the regents next week without having to worry about other tests... St. Johns however, isnt as fucking nice....   Over the weekend I got this wierd feeling, which at the time I wasn't sure was like happy or sad, or like if i liked it or not, but then it went away, and now I want the feeling back... and I dont know how I got it in the first place, or what it was...   I wanna do somethign this weekend.. perhaps see a movie... if anyone wants to, tell me... cause life is boring for Steve Connolly, as it is with most youngsters in this fine age....  I wonder if anyone bothers to come here and read this... If not I have the freedom to say anythign I would like, with no consequences...   Finals will suck... summer will be ok...  I wish i had talent... .... yea  I decided that I'm regressing as a person, but I don't mind that much... I was never one for progression.  I have child bearing hips  Bad Blood is gonna suck... I feel they mis-managed it.. they got benoit wrestling twice, no real promotion for the main event, and they didnt go anywere with the Kane matt Hardy angle... Garrison Cade should be fighting Eugene, not coach...They didnt do anything with Batista... on the other hand, The Great American Bash smackdown only PPV is looking up... it should be an improvment over Judgement Day  WE got out Year books today... Yea... just a thought  I wonder If anyone bothers reading them If i make them really long...  I'm taking my Jazz finale tomorrow... I think I'll do decent... I'm really not looking to do good or anything, I just want to get it the fuck overwith... Jazz isn't a real class anywayt... and ROCK is an artform...  IDONTHAVETOUSETHESPACEBAR...IMAFREESPIRIT  And thats about it... remember, if you read this, you have to much free time... go do something... Idle hands are the Devils Playtime

      Fuck... its today  I've come to the conclusion that I'm stuck in Amercia.... I don't think I'll ever escape tho  I got a question... and feel free to answer anytime you want... Even if you know your doomed before you start, is it worth going along for the ride?  I get the impression I think about way to many things WAY TO MUCH.. .ya know  hey... if i got a problem, I'll let you know..  I'm really angry latly... but the wierd thing is, i got noone to be angry at... i just got this growing rage inside.. .at the same time tho, im kinda passive... and lazy... im really lazy  Something tells me I'll be dead before I'm thirty  Hey everyone... can i get a big FUCK YOU  the real question of the fuckin day is: Are you "stuck in america"  Sixty years is a fuck of a long time... and goddamit, Six billion people is a lot of fuckin people  Fuck... saturday....  the problem is i wanna experience all there is at once, but i got another sixty or seventy years, if it goes that long,  to spread this "life" over... and thats a hell of a long time  We are all so different, but at the same time, we're really all the same  I can't shake the feeling that I'll be dead by the time I'm thirty  ya know... I know that I'll probably meet a girl and fall in love one day, but another feeling that I just can't fuckin shake is that no one will ever really love me in that "O so special" way  Man, theres gotta be somebody for me Mr. Jones... that song is good... to good  We say somethings are childish but there not...... but at the same time we say that somethings are adult and mature, but there not  If I knew a Picasso, I would buy myself a grey guitar and play  Fuck Mr. Jones... I'll never do anything that good  Everything considered... so far 2004 as sucked for me  I shouldnt dwell on the bad so much  WE all wanna be big big stars, but we don't know why and we dont know how.. when everbody loves yout, I'll never be lonely  Your sins into me.. OOO my beautiful one... your sins into me OOO... as this rasperous voice escapes I will tremble a prayer, and I'll never forgive this... Your sins into me, Your sins into me... (Goddamn thats kinda poetic.. AFI... not bad at all).. but wat does that mean... your sins into me... is it being completly "ONE" with another person... wat does it mean... it means something... but what....  All I can see is green.... my favorite colors are black and yellow  Goddamit, lets hear it for Frank Sinatra  Only the good die young... damn right   George Carlin is a genious... SHIT, PISS, FUCK, CUNT, COCKSUCKER, MOTHERFUCKER, TITS, FART, TURD, AND TWAT.  I'm quite attracted to someone, but I don't have the guts to tell her... It wouldn't work out anyway...  I need something exciting in my life... theres nothing here... I'm bored... wheres the adventure that livings supposed to bring... is there any  My guitar has been getting fixed for over a week now, so I've been playing the bass as of late... walkin bassline  The point is think for yourself... question authority... if authoritys right, ok... but hey, they could be wrong  Emotion is everything... It is the driving force of action  People are hyprocritical by nature... its so easy to tell others whats right, but its not as easy to do whats right...   I hate this  Hello Rockview is a good album  SLC punk  i saw farnehiet 911... wasn't as good as i thought it would be.  yea, I don't think you get this  I know I'm an asshole, but if you care about me, the next time you talk to me, could you mentuion you love me... I'm feelin kinda down....  Yea, I am an asshole

      Wow.. seems like just yesterday it was only July 2... how time flys  imitation of life  Today was the fourth of July...   Dude, the Mets swept the Yankees this weekend... hell yea, fuck the yankees  I sincerely mean that  I need to buy some cds... i think im gonna buy americana by the offspring... i heard it wasnt that good, more poppy then there others ones, but i enjoyed pretty fly and lets face it, we all really like pop music in the end.... ooo the denial   I got the impression that one of my friends was ignoring me the other day...    You know wats disturbing about the movies... when you see a movie, once the conflict is resolved, once the guy gets the girl, once everyones happy, movies over.. they never show how the characters go on and live life in everyday situations, after the conflict is over... its not complete  Whats the big deal, tell me how to feel  Whats the big deal, I'm an animal  I'm in a glass case of emotion  no seriously  I generally don't like me... but i sure hope you do  I'm so happy cause today I found my friends... there in my head  Would you sell your soul for sensation  Whats the definition of "soul"... i mean what is it really  Soul (n)- 1. Then animating and vital principal in humans ofton conceived as an immaterial entity that survives death. 2. A spirit or a ghost. 3. A human 4. The central or vital part of something. 5. A person considered as the perfect embodiment of an intangibal quality. 6. A persons emotional or moral nature. 7. A sense of ethnic pride among African Americans. 8. A strong, deeply felt emotion conveyed by a speaker, performer, or artist.  that doesn't really answer the question  We weren't made in the image of god... who the fuck are we kidding  its time i had some time alone  I don't believe in censorship  wow... so much for a party summer  I enjoy TNA... a good healthy alternative   Colors an interesting thing...   Are we really all that different... i think not  I say I'm gonna do things, but then I never do them... what is that  There are no facts, only interpretations  I have a feeling that I'm an aquired taste  Emotion is at the heart of everything... it is the driving force of action  yea yea yea  We are constantly changing, constantly evolving as people... Everything effects us, one way or another  waiting for you... all my sins i said that I would pay for them if I could come back too you.. all my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming   To this day I have no idea who the man who sold the world is...   well i will not be an enemy of anything  I think its far to easy for "punks" to look at any one wearing a suit and going to work and say that they are driven by a mad desire for money, and wealth, to say that their greedy... but the truth is that that punk doesnt know shit about the guy that he just looked at... same thing when punks say "OO they sold out for the money"... first off, just because someone makes money doesnt mean that they do what they do solely for the money.... second, why are they so afraid of money anyway... its little green slips of paper... money can't be the root of all evil... its an inanimate object... rather, I propose that we look no further then human nature as the root of all evil... that sounds real bad, but i don't mean it too.... i mean look, people can do both good and bad things, an optimist would say more good thigns then bad, and a pessimist vice-versa, but an inanimate object can't do anything.. it can't think it can't live, so how can it be the root of anything... greed and selfishness are the root of what we call "evil" and those emotions exist in all of us, therefor, life is the roots of all evil... and on the other hand kindness, genoristy, and compassion create the good in the world, and I believe they exist in all of us to... all of us... so life is the root of alemotion is the begginging of everything... life is the root of all good things... everything flows out of life  When i think of heaven.. deliver me in a black wing bird.. i think of dieing.... Don't try to bleed me, cause ive been here before and I deserve a little more... i belong in the service of the queen, i belong anywhere but in between... shes been dieing, and I've been drinking... I AM THE RAIN KING  What will life be like in a year...  Wasting time just hangin around  My jaw hurts...  so do my eyes....  Am I vain?  or hypocritical?  I take back my previous "hell yea, fuck the yankees"... I'm not mad, just frustrated over my teams usual shortcomings... however, thing was a good weekend for the mets  I really need to get some new cds....  Ha, the longest case of the hiccups was over a 60 year period- Charles Osborne started hicupping in 1922 while weighing a hog before slaugthering it... unable to find a cure, he finalyl stoped hiccuping naturally one morning in 1990.   Nobody really knows me... nobody really knows anyone  I've officailly been writing this for the past hour and three minutes...  I think its time i called it a night
