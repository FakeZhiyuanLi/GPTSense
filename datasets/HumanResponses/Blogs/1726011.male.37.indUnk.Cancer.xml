According to CNN, the  urlLink recent flap  over the terrorism futures market was the  urlLink final straw  for John Poindexter, the famous Iran-Contra conspirator.  He was also behind the Pentagon's  urlLink Total Information Awareness  program that died quickly after the plans became public.

The Denver post has the story on some  urlLink on-the-ground resistance  to the Patriot Act by that well known rebellious group, librarians.  Their stance is based on the crazy notion that  "People have a right to read what they want to read without other people looking over their shoulder."  How long before Bush brands them as terrorists?

       2.4% INCREASE IN GDP?  YOU HAVE BUSH TO THANK 
 
Really.  A post at  urlLink General Glut's Globblog  shows how the 2nd quarter increase in GDP is calculated and points out that almost all the growth can be  urlLink attributed to one-time spending  for the Iraq war (without which the growth rate would be 0.67%).  I can see Bush's re-election slogan now: "A war every quarter!"

       REPUBLICANS AND GAY MARRIAGE 
 
With Bush's comments yesterday which seem to tacitly endorse the Federal Marriage Ammendment to the constitution (FMA), we seem to be headed for a major battle over gay marriage.  While Bush stopped short of formally endorsing the FMA, he stated that White House lawyers are looking at ways of "codifying" marriage as a heterosexsual union into federal law.  Of course, that was what the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), signed by Clinton, was supposed to do (to read analysis of the law, go  urlLink here ).  Andrew Sullivan has a typically thoughtful  urlLink series of posts  on this subject, and one statement caught my eye:
 
Certainly, if this amendment is pursued by this administration, it's the end of any relationship between the gay community and the Republican party.
 
Really?  Between Rick Santorum's  urlLink comments  and Bill Frists  urlLink endorsement  of the FMA that's two thirds of the Republican Senate leadership.  I think we all know where Tom DeLay stands.  When  urlLink The Log Cabin Republicans  called on Bush to renounce Santorum's remarks he responded by calling Sanrotum an "inclusive" man.  Now they  urlLink respond  to Bush's statement yesterday:
 
Log Cabin reminds the President that the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), signed by President Clinton in 1996, defined marriage as being between only a man and a women. The bill passed Congress with bi-partisan support. There are far more important priorities facing our nation than duplicating existing federal legislation. We encourage the White House to focus on winning the war on terror and jump-starting the American economy.
  
So the problem with the FMA is not that it will "enshrine second-class citizenship for gays in the sacred words of the founding document," as Sullivan states, but that it is redundant.  It is difficult to imagine how the Republican Party could be more hostile to gay equality, yet organizations like the Log Cabin Republicans quietly express their opposition and continue to support the party.
 
To be fair the Democrats have a way to go on this issue as well.  None of the presidential frontrunners, or leaders of the Democratic Party have endorsed full legal rights, including marriage, for gays. On the other hand they are not leading the charge to ammend the constitution to make sure gays never achieve equal status under federal law.

       THE EVIDENCE PILES UP 
 
 
Evidence that there was no active WMD program in Iraq at the time of our invasion that is.  This  urlLink article  in the Washington Post details how, despite having many Iraqi scientists in custody and cooperating with interrogtaors.  The article has a joint byline by Walter Pincus and Kevin Sullivan.  Pincus is a veteran reporter with a lot of contacts in the CIA.  His articles will be a good barometer of how the war between the Bush Administration and the CIA is going to play out over the next few weeks.
 
No matter the circumstances, all of the scientists interviewed have denied that Hussein had reconstituted his nuclear weapons program or developed and hidden chemical or biological weapons since United Nations inspectors left in 1998.
 
There's more:
 
The White House, for instance, has cited the case of nuclear scientist Mahdi Obeidi, who recently dug up plans and components for a gas centrifuge that he said he buried in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf War. The White House has pointed to the discovery as a sign of Hussein's continuing nuclear ambitions, but Obeidi told his interrogators that Iraq's nuclear program was dormant in the years before war began in March.

The sources said Obeidi also disputed evidence cited by the administration -- namely Iraq's purchase of aluminum tubes that various officials said were for a new centrifuge program to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs. Obeidi said the tubes were for rockets, as Iraq had said before the war.
 
Of course Bush doesn't believe them:
 
CIA analysts do not believe he has told the whole truth, said one Bush administration official.
 
I guess the Bush Administration would know a little something about not telling the whole truth.

       A LITTLE SLOPPINESS AT THE ALTERCATION? 
 
 
Don't get me wrong, I like Eric Alterman and his blog on msnbc.com, but his  urlLink post today  strikes me as problematic:
 
They ignored their own National Intelligence Estimate warning that the likely response of Saddam Hussein to an invasion was the use of his chemical and biological weapons against the United States, possibly in conjunction with al-Qaida â€” an alliance they pretend already existed for the purposes of justifying their dishonest war, but for which they possess no evidence
 
It seems to me that claiming they ignored a potential Iraq-Al-queda threat, then in the same sentence denounce their linking of Iraq and Al-queda is a little disingenuous.  I agree with his larger point, as evidenced by the TSA debacle, that the Bushies give a lot of talk and scarcely few resources to homeland security, but this is the kind of thing that the right wingers will jump all over, proving that all liberals are liars and hypocrites, and he  urlLink should understand  that as well as anyone.
 
 
 UPDATE:   Alterman responds via email that he meant that the invasion of Iraq would  CREATE  a link between Iraq and Al-Queda that had not previously existed.  The Refuge appreciates Mr. Alterman's prompt reply to the inquiry.

       UPDATE ON THE AIR MARSHALLS, TSA STILL $900,000,000 IN THE HOLE 
 
 
It seems that even officials at the DHS are capable of realizing when they look stupid.  As I noted  urlLink below  it was reported that the Air Marshall program was being cut back to avoid the marshalls having to spend the night in a hotel, due to budgetary concerns.  This was on the same day that they announced a potential highjacking threat.  It appears that, as a result of the negative publicity, they have reversed themselves accoridng to msnbc.com:

 
In an apparent reversal of policy, the Transportation Security Administration will immediately begin scheduling air marshals back on cross-country and international flights, MSNBC.com has learned. The move comes less than 24 hours after MSNBC.com reported that air marshals were being pulled from those flights because of budget problems associated with the costs of overnight lodging for the marshals. 
 
However, this doesn't mean the TSA is not suffering from underfunding:
 
The TSA, which houses the air marshal program, has been under severe budgetary constraints, forcing cutbacks in several areas, including laying off of federal airport screeners and the recently announced suspension of advanced Phase II training for its agents, sources told MSNBC.com. The move to cut out flights requiring air marshals to stay overnight stemmed from those same budget problems, MSNBC.com was told by an agency source.
 
It makes you think, though, how many stupid things does this administration have to do and then reverse themselves (I haven't even commented on  urlLink this brilliant idea ) before people start to wonder if they really have any idea what the hell they are doing.

       BUSH ON GAY MARRIAGE 
 
 
Andrew Sullivan posted this quote that Bush gave in a  urlLink news conference  today regarding his views on gay marriage, I just had to post is as well:

 
I am mindful that we're all sinners, I caution those who may try to take the speck out of their neighbor's eye when they got a log in their own. I think it's very important for our society to respect each individual, to welcome those with good hearts, to be a welcoming country.  On the other hand, that does not mean that somebody like me needs to compromise on issues such as marriage," he continued. "That's really where the issue is headed here in Washington, and that is the definition of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I believe a marriage is between a man and a woman. And I think we ought to codify that one way or the other. And we've got lawyers looking at the best way to do that.
 
I am not sure what the hell he is talking about, but I feel much better knowing that the White House Laywers are on the case.

       HOMELAND SECURITY ON THE CHEAP 
 
 
Josh Marshall has a great  urlLink post  this morning pointing out that on the same day the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) raises the threat of another possible suicide highjacking, they are scaling back the Air Marshall program and the number of screeners at TSA.  He quotes  urlLink this paragraph  from the Washington Post
 
Just one day before the memo [warning of potential new highjacking plots] was distributed, an official with the undercover Federal Air Marshal Service canceled what are considered some of the most vulnerable flight missions because they required marshals to spend nights in hotels, as well as cut training for Washington-area agents next month. The official cited "monetary considerations," according to an e-mail obtained by The Washington Post.
 
As he points out, given that we are spending $1 Billion a week in Iraq, you would think we could spring for a few hotel rooms to protect our airways.

       CITY PAGES GOES WHERE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FEARS TO TREAD 
 
 

The City Pages, a weekly alternative newspaper in Minneapolis, has a cover story this week titled  urlLink The Emperor Has No Flight Suit   which is definitely worth a read.  It chronicles the CIA vs. Bush war and the failure (until recently) of the mainstream media and the Democrats to challenge the chasm between the Bush Administration's rhetoric and reality.  The whole article is worth reading, but I think one of the most telling quotes is a small aside at the end:
 
When City Pages contacted the White House for copies of photographs to accompany this story, the flack who fielded the request demanded to know what it was about, and later declined the request. A small thing, but it was the first time in my cumulative 10 years or so at the paper that any agency or office of the federal government has flatly refused to provide public materials on the grounds that it didn't like what we might do with them.
 
I think that pretty much sums up the attitude in The White House.

       THOSE TREASONOUS LIBERALS 
 
 

Andrew Sullivan continues on the theme espoused by many conservatives that are not as extreme and dishonest as Ann Coulter, that all the criticism of the war from the left is coming from "Anti-Western" liberals who just think that anything having to do with American power is bad.  He dismisses all criticism as " urlLink petty politics from people who are still pissed they lost the war over the war ."  He has  urlLink noted :
 
These people, it's worth remembering, believe that the exercise of American military power is almost always more morally problematic than any foreign tyranny or even a serious security threat to the homeland. They can only justify American military power if it is wielded under imminent, grave danger that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.
 
He continues that theme today with a  urlLink post  from blogger  urlLink Norman Geras  about how the Anti-Western left is rooting for setbacks (and presumably more American deaths) in Iraq.  While it may make Mr. Sullivan feel better to dismiss all criticism as knee-jerk anti-western lefty peacenik bitterness, it is not the case and to do so may hinder progress of the reconstruction of Iraq.  It is untrue that it is only Democrats that are expressing concern about Iraq policy, Republican  urlLink Senator Richard Lugar  complained that the administration is not being honest about the true costs of the reconstruction:
 
Because of some combination of bureaucratic inertia, political caution and unrealistic expectations left over from the war, we do not appear to be confident about our course in Iraq.
 
Fred Kaplan  urlLink notes  today in  urlLink Slate  that there are signs that the administration is acutely aware that things in Iraq are not going well, he notes two things:
 
  The 3rd Infantry Division, apparently in response to disparaging remarks made to reporters about the political leadership by some soldiers, will no longer accept embedded reporters.
 
  The bizarre series of leaks over the weekend speculating that the administration was going to try to get James Baker III, or a Baker-like figure, to become involved in the recontruction of Iraq at a high level (it now appears that  urlLink this will not happen  despite the hopes of some in the administration).
 
Does Mr. Sullivan may prefer to stick his head in the sand and assume that   urlLink everything is going just fine  if only the mainstream media would report it?  Apparently so, and any if anyone thinks that the Bush administration planning and policy on post-war Iraq is anything but perfect, it's just sour grapes.  The probelm here is that many of the assumptions from the neocon circles in the administration about post-war Iraq have turned out to be wrong, and it is quite clear that the administration continues to downplay the length and depth of commitment that will be required for a successful reconstruction of Iraq.  I agree that, at this point, nothing is more important than the successful rebuilding and the creation of a free society with a representative government in Iraq.  For this to work, Bush may have to do some things, such as go to the U.N. to gain more international credibility and more international troops and start preparing the American public for a long and costly occupation, which many in his administration will resist.  Bush will only consider such action if he feels pressure to do so, and that pressure is unlikely to come from within the administration anytime soon.
 
 
Let me be clear, I want this to work, I hope they find Saddam soon, this is more important than whether or not Bush is re-elected.  However, covering your ears and repeating to yourself over and over "everything is just fine" is not a strategy likely to succeed.

      IT'S OKAY TO LIE -- THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS
The subtle shift in rhetoric coming from the Bush Administration and the neocon establishment became decidedly less subtle today.  First, Andrew Sullivan  urlLink cites  a  urlLink speech  President Bush gave to the Urban League emphasizing the global context of the war in Iraq as opposed to the "imminent threat" he posed prior to the war.  Sullivan states:
 
 It seems to me that this argument should be more front and center in Bush's rhetoric. He needs to remind people of the global context of the Iraq war, the need to go on the offensive against terrorism, and trumpet the decision of this administration to tackle the deeper Middle East issue that fuels terrorism - despotism. 
 
This is, of course, the true reason for going to war in Iraq, the neocon's grand plans to remake the Middle East in our image, and thereby eliminate the terrorist threat by replacing the dictatorial Arab regimes with healthy, flourishing democracies.  I wont debate the merits of this argument now except to point out that such a project would seem to me to require a large American military presence in the middle east for a long time, something that the neocons and the Bushies have not come clean as to the level of commitment that would be required.

The other implication of  Sullivan's point is that if they keep pointing out how great the world is now that Saddam is gone, nobody will care that they lied about the reasons for going to war.  To make that point we have an  urlLink opinion piece  in today's WSJ (pointed out by  urlLink Joe Conason ) by Steven Den Beste which makes no bones about the reasons for war or what it took to get us there.  He states flatly:
 
 In fact, the real reason we went into Iraq was precisely to "nation build": to create a secularized, liberated, cosmopolitan society in a core Arab nation. 
 
Lets forget for a moment Bush' clear-cut deriding of nation building during the presidential debates of 2000, so if that was the real reason for invading Iraq, why make up all that stuff about Saddam's nukes and massive stocks of biological and chemical weapons?
 
 Honesty and plain speaking are not virtues for politicians and diplomats. If either Mr. Bush or Mr. Blair had said what I did, it would have hit the fan big-time. Making clear a year ago that this was our true agenda would have virtually guaranteed that it would fail. Among other things, it would have caused all of the brutal dictators and corrupt monarchs in the region to unite with Saddam against us, and would have made the invasion impossible. But now the die is cast, and said brutal dictators and corrupt monarchs no longer have the ability to stop the future. 
 
I'm not clear as to how the brutal dictators and corrupt monarchs in the region would have united with Saddam to make the invasion impossible, but the implication is clear:  It was okay to mislead about the real reasons for war.  Though he argues that it was necessary because otherwise the invasion would have been impossible is not supported by any clear idea as to how this would have happened.  It seems much more likely that the Bushies felt they had to create the feeling of an imminent threat to garner strong support for the War from the American public.  He then goes on, after calling the Democrats some names to say:
 
 The Democrats won't have any influence until they actually look toward the future and start talking about what they think we actually should do. Bitching about what actually happened will get them headlines, but it isn't ultimately going to get them enough votes to win. And I think that they know it. 
 
I think that he is right in that the Democrats need to start to shift their focus somewhat from opposition to the war to how best to proceed from here.  The invasion is a done deal, and there can be no question that to leave the job half-done at this point would be far worse than having never invaded in the first place.  The clear lack of planning on the part of the Bush administration provides plenty of room for criticism, and the Democrats can get out front on this by pressuring Bush to go to the U.N. to get more support for the reconstruction and forcing him to come clean about the extent of the commitment required to carry out the neocon strategy.

Having said that, I think the right, naturally of course, underestimates the effect that Bush's dishonesty will have.  I don't think that Americans in general are too happy about being misled.  While they still tend to support the war, the polls clearly demonstrate a growing discomfort with the way this war was sold.  The idea of a long term large American military presence in the Middle East that will be required to carry out the neocon strategy (I just don't see how this works without a lot of American troops, or U.N. troops, on the ground for a long time) has not been publicly debated, and the extent of the public's appetite for an American empire is not clear at this point.

       THE TEN COMMANDMENTS  - BAD LAW? 
 
Chrisopher Hitchens at  urlLink Slate  turns his bitter sarcasm to the Ten Commandments and comes up with a pretty  urlLink amusing article  (a rarity for Hitchens in my opinion):
 
This leaves us with the insoluble mystery of why [God] would have molded ("in his own image," yet) a covetous, murderous, disrespectful, lying, and adulterous species. Create them sick, and then command them to be well? What a mad despot this is, and how fortunate we are that he exists only in the minds of his worshippers.
 
After musing about the many other orders from the old testament, including ox-goring and witch burning, he concludes fairly harshly on the topic of religion in general:
 
Too many editorialists have described the recent flap as a silly confrontation with exhibitionist fundamentalism, when the true problem is our failure to recognize that religion is not just incongruent with morality but in essential ways incompatible with it.
 
He's gonna burn in hell for that one.

       WSJ EDITORIAL THAT MAKES SENSE? 
 
I have to admit that I don't subscribe to the WSJ, so the only time I read articles or quotes from that paper is when they are sent to me or posted on someone's site, so I have a filtered view.  Having said that, some of the most outrageous things ever printed come from the editorial page of the WSJ.  Referring to people whose incomes are too low to pay federal taxes as  urlLink 'lucky duckies'  comes to mind.  However, I feel that to be fair and balanced I should post this quote from the WSJ about the Ten Commandments flap in Alabama (from  urlLink Media Whores Online ):
 
Of course, Justice Moore's political grandstanding isn't helping matters. And his defiance of U.S. District Court Judge Myron Thompson's order to remove the monument has resulted, appropriately, in his suspension from the bench. The civil disobedience argument may fly for a Martin Luther King, but certainly not for an elected state judge sworn to enforce the law. If Justice Moore wants to become a professional protester and ignore federal court orders, he'll need to hang up his robe first.
 
I think that is well said.  I will only add that, in my view, morality, not God, is the foundation of our laws.  For many people God is the foundation of their morality, but not for everyone and not the same God.  In order for the Government to avoid playing favorites in religion (see the  urlLink establishment clause ) it has to take steps that, while seeming to be anti-religious, are in fact designed to protect  ALL  religions.  Why is it so hard for people to understand this?  What would the Christian Right do if a judge in California wanted to place a monument to the Koran in his or her courthouse?  I think we all know how that would go.

       IRAQI WMD'S IN LEBANON? 
 
On March 30, 2003 Donald Rumsfeld said in reference to Iraq's WMDs:
 
We know where they are. They are in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad.
 
Okay, so that turned out to be wrong.  Now, however,  urlLink WorldNetDaily  is  urlLink reporting  that some or all of Iraq WMDs were transferred to Lebanon with Syria's approval.
 
Israeli intelligence has identified what are believed to be Iraqi weapons of mass destruction goods in Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon, U.S. officials said. 
 
The Israelis used a spy satellite to photograph several tractor-trailer loads of suspected weapons into the Bekaa Valley, where the Islamist terrorist group is based. 
 
Shipments there began in early January and ended the first week of March. 
 
According to Israeli intelligence, Saddam paid Syrian leader Bashar Assad $35 million to hide the weapons. 
 
First, the WorldNetDaily is hardly an unbiased source, it is a very right-leaning Christian website (don't believe me? spend 20 seconds reviewing their headlines), but even if this is true isn't it a bad thing?  Sure, some will say it shows Bush was right that Saddam had WMDs, but won't the people who warned the war might cause them to get dispersed to other terrorists or rogue states also be correct?  How, exactly, does the transfer of large stocks of chemical and biological weapons from Iraq to Hezbollah make us safer?  I doubt the Israelis are too happy about it.

       "I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW POOR PEOPLE THINK" 
 
From Dana Milbank in todays  urlLink Washington Post :
 
Nobody ever said compassionate conservatives are colorblind. On the Bush '04 campaign's new Web site, there is a "photo gallery" feature for each of the president's policy priorities. In the "compassion" photo gallery, 16 of the 20 shots feature Bush with non-white faces (the other four are studies of Bush). By contrast, all 16 of the photos in the "environment" gallery display what appear to be white complexions. 
 
The New York times  urlLink reports  on the disenchantment of some with Bush's "compassionate conservatism"
 
"After three years, he's failed the test," said one prominent early supporter, the Rev. Jim Wallis, leader of Call to Renewal, a network of churches that fights poverty.
 
Mr. Wallis said Mr. Bush had told him as president-elect that "I don't understand how poor people think," and appealed to him for help by calling himself "a white Republican guy who doesn't get it, but I'd like to." Now, Mr. Wallis said, "his policy has not come even close to matching his words."

In case you missed it, Judge Denny Chin  urlLink dismissed  Fox News Channels absurd lawsuit against Al Franken.  Here are some choice quotes from the judge:
 
This is an easy case in my view and wholly without merit, both factually and legally.
 
 
There is absolutely no way that any person not completely dense would be confused by this cover and think that Fox was accusing Bill O'Reilly of being a liar. . .I don't know if Fox is arguing that its viewers are less sophisticated than buyers of Mr. Franken's book
 
 
Do you think that the reasonable consumer, seeing the word `lies' over Mr. O'Reilly's face would believe Mr. O'Reilly is endorsing this book? (this one prompted an outburst of laughter in the courtroom)
 
Fox's crack legal team was "considering its options."  I  really, really  hope they appeal.

       THAT LIBERAL MEDIA 
 
Friday, Joe Consason was on Hardball with Chris Matthews when this exchange ocurred (from  urlLink Slyblog .  Prager is conservative columnist  urlLink Dennis Prager ):
 
CONASON: All right. I'll give you a very good example, Chris. The "Today" show gave Coulter free -- Ann Coulter gave free reign on the "Today" show after she had called Katie Couric the equivalent of Hitler's mistress, OK. And she still got on there. I mean, I have a long list in the book of the way the red carpet was rolled out for Ann Coulter to tell her side of the story.
 
MATTHEWS: Yes. By the way, there's something inaccurate in her book. There is something inaccurate in her book, because you said that she was on my show, HARDBALL, eight times. I would be surprised if she was on once.
 
CONASON: No, that's what Nexus shows, Chris. You'll have to correct it with them.
 
MATTHEWS: No, no, no.
 
CONASON: That's what it shows.
 
MATTHEWS: She's not.
 
CONASON: That is what it shows. She's been on your show - and you know.
 
MATTHEWS: Eight times? On one book - eight times on a book?
 
CONASON: What I would appreciate right now, Chris.
 
PRAGER: What he is telling you.
 
CONASON: What I would appreciate right now, Chris.
 
PRAGER: He is telling you how many times she was on your show.
 
CONASON: I'm telling you how many times Lexus - Nexus.
 
PRAGER: That's incredible.
 
So who was right and who was blatantly ignoring those inconvenient facts?  A Lexis-Nexus search quickly reveals the truth (also from  urlLink Slyblog , however a brief search performed by me confirms several documented appearances):
 
 June 26, 2002 (Mike Barnicle hosts and quotes from the book and says, "Ann, I love you."),
 

 June 28, 2002 (Mike Barnicle guest hosts, more quotes from Slander),
 

 July 2, 2002 (Matthews plugs her book again),
 

 August 14, 2002 (Matthews: "Ann Coulter, author of the best selling 'Slander'"),
 

 September 2, 2002 (Matthews: "Congratulations by they way number one again on the "New York Times" best seller list. The name of the book is 'Slander'"),
 

 November 15, 2002 (Matthews, staggeringly, admits that Hardball has tirelessly promoted Slander: "Ann Coulter, if it's anybody else, you owe us lots of money. "),
 

 December 5, 2002 (Matthews: "Ann, you've been very good in your book to make the point that the media tends to be liberal and dismiss of any conservative gain on any front"),
 

 January 2, 2003 (Barnicle guest hosts and plugs "Slander").
 
So first we had Bill O'Reilly falsely claiming that he won a peabody, and when Al Frankes calls him on it he then claims he never said it.  Now Matthews just simply ignores facts he must clearly have known in order to try to undermine Conason's credibility.  I have no problem if people want to voice conservative views and debate the issues, but this sort of blatant ignorance of facts undermines our ability to have a real discourse about the issues facing our country.  I'm sure both sides are guilty, but the ability of the right-wing to simply ignore reality when it doesn't support their views lately is amazing.

       COULTER SCARED OF JOE CONASON 
 
This is from the NY Daily News  urlLink Daily Dish :
 
Tough-talking Ann Coulter wouldn't say a word last night.
 
At the last minute, the conservative pundit canceled her appearance opposite best-selling "Big Lies" author Joe Conason on CNBC's "Kudlow & Cramer" - this after having programmers change the debate to fit her schedule.
 
One might think the roundtable, which featured Wall Streeter James Cramer and Reaganite Lawrence Kudlow, would be a breeze for Coulter. Could she have been afraid of facing Conason, whose book presents evidence that her arguments are ill-researched and calls her lifestyle hypocritical?
 
Coulter didn't answer our E-mail. 
 
Perhaps she was worried someone might actually hold her accountable for her statements.

       A REPUBLICAN MAKES SENSE 
 
I know, it is hard to believe.  Since I so often point out the stupid and false things Republicans say, I felt obligated to point out a case where a Republican actually makes sense and seems to adhere to conservative principles.  Besides someone has to link to this stuff while  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  is on vacation.  Bob Barr, former Republican congressman from Georgia, wrote an  urlLink op-ed  in todays Washington Post regarding Gay Marriage and the proposed constitutional ammendment:
 
Marriage is a quintessential state issue. The Defense of Marriage Act goes as far as is necessary in codifying the federal legal status and parameters of marriage. A constitutional amendment is both unnecessary and needlessly intrusive and punitive.
 
What's that? Federalism? Limited government?  No wonder he's no longer in congress, that type of conservatism would never be tolerated in today's Republican party.  Don't get me wrong, I don't support the Defense of Marriage act, but at least he is opposing tinkering with the constitution.

       ALL THE PRESIDENT'S LIES 
 
This was the title of the cover story in last week's  urlLink City Pages  which detailed many of the falsehoods put forth by The Bush Administration.  I don't know why people from Texas are reading a Minnesota alternative weekly, but this letter was sent in response:
 
Your problem, as you have the same one that the rest of you bleeding heart lib's have, is this: Staunch conservatives don't care if you incorrectly misunderstood what G.W. Bush and Rumsfeld were pitching the American public about the war. Hell, most of us don't even mind if he stretched the truth to get all you libs on board. It's certainly not my fault you're that gullible. In the great state of Texas that I live in, most, if not all, of my friends, acquaintances, and neighbors wanted Saddam out of there for the very simple reason that he is a bad guy who treated his people horribly, anything else was icing on the cake. Perhaps what you need is a reality check and an understanding that the clear majority of Americans don't need to see proof of weapons of mass destruction to feel very, very, very good about ousting Saddam and killing his two sons. Have a great day, my liberally challenged friend! Thank God we have a president in place with the intestinal fortitude to do what's morally right, instead of what's politically correct. Proudly exposing the holes in the arguments from the liberal left, one gigantic void at a time, since 1968.
 
Todd Hale  
Katy, Texas
 
Wow.  This letter makes two pretty amazing points.  The first is an admission that Bush misled the public, but that it is okay because Saddam is such a bad guy.  I don't know about you, but if the means is the destruction of American Democracy (which is the certain result if an informed populace is no longer necessary) the end comes nowhere close to a justification.  The second is that it is okay for America to send 100,000 troops and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to oust leaders that repress their citizens.  So when to the invasions of Zimbabwe, Algeria, Saudi Arabia just to name a few begin?
 
I fear for our country.

       HOMELAND INSECURITY, PART II 
 
From today's  urlLink New York Times :
 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 — Two private studies released this week have found that police officers, firefighters, public school safety officers and other emergency response workers believe that nearly two years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, they are unprepared if terrorists strike again.
 
The larger of the studies, prepared for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and made public today by the Rand Corporation, found that police officers and firefighters agreed that "they do not know what they need to be protected against, what form of protection is appropriate and where to look for such protection." 
 
I think this is amazing given all the lip service payed to homeland security by Bush.  The Rand Corporation is not some lefty think tank either.  Will we ever wake up?

       WHY I HATE GEORGE W. BUSH 
 
This was  urlLink posted  by a reader in "The Fray,"  which is  urlLink Slate's  reader comment area.  It is pretty long, but I think it coherently states the problems so many of us have with The President:
 
Alright, you asked for it. I'll try to keep my wits about me, though the emotional base upon which this argument is built is quite tumultuous.
 
Why would I say that I "hate" George W. Bush? Isn't that a little strong? Isn't he just your average politician? Isn't this just some natural extension of your overall left-leaning political views?
 
No, not really.
 
Before I get to George W. Bush, I need to explain what I think about politicians in general. For the moment, let us stipulate that politicians come in three general flavors:
 
The first category of politicians I believe to be genuinely honest and noble men committed to the ideal of public service. These are politicians who genuinely care, and strive to improve the Republic they cherish and the lives of its citizens. I believe these politicians to have principles, but I think they also understand reality rather well. They will master the art of compromise in the interests of accomplishment, and they may very well change their minds and their positions as they age or new events and concerns arise. But in the end, they keep one eye on what they sincerely believe to be RIGHT and another eye out for the pitfalls and road signs along the way…
 
The next category is where I place the demagogic ideologues. These are individuals who seem to enter politics through the motivation of zealotry rather than for personal gain. They're motives are similar to those of the noble politicians, but they're inability to adapt or to bend within the political process makes them dangerous to our Republic. For them, politics is about specific ends, and the means will always be adapted as needed to attain them….
 
Then, bottom on the totem pole of politicians, I would lump the remainder… the unscrupulous cynics who gravitate to the profession for the love of power. Often, we learn the truth about these politicians in their trials, as with Senator Toricelli or with Richard M. Nixon. Dan Rostenkowski or Gray Davis. And one, one of these scumbags prances before the public eye, nakedly self-aggrandizing… contemptuous of America, contemptuous of Americans, contemptuous of his detractors, contemptuous of his supporters… and nobody seems to notice. And that one, I call him George W. Bush.
 
I can find very little in the life of George W. Bush to admire or to respect. I can't fault him for having the fortune to be born into a family of wealth, power and privilege. However, all the evidence shows that he never felt any special responsibility came attached to the gifts he received from birth. And I'm not even talking about the responsibility to be some kind of philanthropist or minister to the poor. I'm talking about the responsibility to demonstrate that he was entitled to all that he had by effort as well as by blood. With a special dispensation he was allowed into a top East Coast prep school where he slacked off and took the special efforts exerted on his behalf for granted. Given an unearned shot at an institution allegedly based on merit, he squandered and disdained the opportunity. Then, with mediocre grades he went to Yale on the strength of connections alone, maintaining a C average, far below the standard those who have attained such an opportunity through effort hold themselves to. Somehow, he still managed to fail his way upward into the Harvard MBA program, where again, there is no evidence that he applied himself with any particular diligence. Again and again, through Bush's life, he was handed opportunity that people strive ceaselessly for. Without any effort, he received chances that people work themselves to the bone to never get a shot at. And at each stage, he wasted it, unmindful and seemingly uncaring of the extraordinary exceptions that had been made on his behalf.
 
Between his stint at Yale and the one at Harvard, Bush "served" in the military. I don't see any particular disgrace in dodging the draft. Many have done it, and many who haven't would have. My own father joined the Marine Corps when his student deferment expired on the sensible theory that it was the branch least likely to send him abroad. Bill Clinton joined the Rhodes Scholar program. Dan Quayle joined the Indiana National Guard. But my father SERVED his term as a Marine. Bill Clinton WENT to Oxford. Dan Quayle PUT IN HIS TIME in the Indiana National Guard. Does it bother me that George W. Bush disappeared from active duty in the Texas Air National Guard? Ceased taking the physical after the institution of a drug-testing policy in 1972? Yes. It really does bother me. And it should bother you too. Because once again, it points straight to the issue of contempt. Contempt for America, for the obligations of citizenship. Our system is set up to grant allowances. But if an allowance is made for you, you should at least feel obligated to HONOR THE TERMS of your dispensation. And George W. Bush demonstrated no such sense of duty. No such sense of honor…
 
I find nothing especially worthy of censure in his business career. It does little to enhance my opinion of him, as it demonstrates mostly a capacity to continue reaping, as an adult, the benefits of his more noble father's efforts … At the age of 40, we are led to believe that he found some new inner-strength. It's hard not to look at contempt with a man who can honestly profess that he did not reach adulthood until his 40's. But in such matters, late is always better than never… 
 
Being a shallow and opportunistic politician isn't an inherently damnable offense, though I would certainly argue he is one. Our country would have been better off had a more noble character been poised to reap the rewards of the Supreme Court's unfortunate choice in 2000, but I cannot fault him too much for his failures of leadership in that moment. His embrace of steel tariffs and agricultural policy more reactionary than those supported by Dick Gephardt doesn't automatically disqualify him from the ranks of men entitled to some mercy.
 
In the end, it comes down to the simple issue of character.
 
People love to fulminate about character. My standards are not those of everyone. I don't really hold any feelings against those prone to sins of the appetite, as Bill Clinton was. I have trouble holding poor judgment against those who demonstrate it. All I ask is some evidence of a fundamental respect for the dignity of people. And I don't think George W. Bush has that respect…
 
There are those who believe that all politicians lie, and that Bush's are nothing exceptional. I don't know how to rebut such a charge, other than to state firmly and forcefully that I disagree. Watching Bush tell the nation with a straight face that they will receive an "average" tax cut of $1000 when he knows what the average person will actually receive is one of those little acts of disrespect. Sneeringly dismissing the protests of hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions worldwide at his instigation of a war abroad as mere "focus groups" is a telling indicator of the disrespect which created the frustration that propelled them to the streets in the first place (may I remind you, that neither his father nor his immediate predecessor faced anything on a comparable scale). Putting out word that he believed Air Force One to be the target of a terrorist attack to account for his shameful disappearance on September 11th of 2001… that's a kind of falsehood which makes my stomach start to churn in disgust. Untruths and misrepresentations abound in this President's public discourse, when he even bothers to show himself in public. More than usual, even for a politician. And, frankly, more than should be acceptable in the America I thought I knew…
 
There aren't words to describe the horror I feel when I see Bush look into the nation's television cameras with that sadistic little smirk and tell us euphemistically, as if half-choking on a stifled snort that our enemies… "let's put it this way: they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies." The barely-suppressed, no not really suppressed at all, look of GLEE at the thought of the death America has inflicted upon its enemies. I recognize that it is necessary to kill human beings. I recognize that our security demands it. That every president must hold the lives and deaths of strangers in his hands. But the fact that we MUST kill NEVER excuses taking delight THAT we kill. You probably don't believe me. I don't know if you believe Tucker Carlson when he describes Bush's mockery of Karla Faye Tucker: "Please," Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, "don't kill me." Maybe some of you don't believe it. Worse, maybe some of you feel the same way, and consider Bush's response… virtuous? I don't know. I look at Bush, taunting the camera, daring America's enemies to "bring it on" and I see a sick and disgusting man – the worst face of America sneering in the spotlight. A man who doesn't bother to care about the enormity of his job, the enormity of its consequences, and the enormity of this glorious Republic we've brought forth.
 
When I look at George W. Bush, I don't see a patriot. I see a lying, psychopathic narcissist. And it pains me, it grieves me, it WOUNDS me to realize that this puts me not only in the minority… but in the "whacko fringe." …
 
Well said.

       REVISIONIST HISTORY INDEED 
 
Dana Milbank, one of the few Washington beat reporters with a clue,  urlLink documents  Bush's changing tone on Iraq:
 
President Bush, revising his earlier characterization of the fighting in Iraq, said in an interview released yesterday that combat operations are still underway in that country. 
  
In an interview with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service given on Thursday and released by the White House yesterday, Bush interrupted the questioner when asked about his announcement on May 1 of, as the journalist put it, "the end of combat operations." 
 
"Actually, major military operations," Bush replied. "Because we still have combat operations going on." Bush added: "It's a different kind of combat mission, but, nevertheless, it's combat, just ask the kids that are over there killing and being shot at." 
 
In his May 1 speech on the USS Abraham Lincoln, Bush declared: "Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country." The headline on the White House site above Bush's May 1 speech is "President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended."
 
Since then, a search of Bush speeches on the White House Web site indicates, the president had not spoken of the guerrilla fighting in Iraq as combat until this interview; he had earlier spoken of the "cessation of combat" in Iraq.
 
It turns out that the White House has gone back and changed the title of the president's famous speech on th U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, changing the 'Combat Operations' to 'Major Combat Operations.'  You can check out the  urlLink before  and  urlLink after  but click quickly because who knows how long until all original references to the speech are removed.  The Likely Story has a nice  urlLink post  as well.

       GOP OUTSOURCING JOBS TO INDIA 
 
This story, although it is from January, is starting to get some play, so I figured I would spread the word.  Apparently, not satisfied by the U.S. economy having lost 3 million jobs so far during his presidency, the GOP is  urlLink outsourcing  its phone fund raising to India:
 
The US Republican Party now has a band of young and enthusiastic fund-raisers in Noida and Gurgaon.
 
HCL eServe, the business process outsourcing arm of the Shiv Nadar-promoted HCL Technologies, has bagged a project to undertake a fund-raising campaign for the US Republican Party over the telephone. 
 
This is the first time such a project has been handed out to a company outside the US. The market research and public relations companies engaged by the party usually undertake such projects.
 
Not that we needed more evidence of GOP hypocrisy.

       BUSH WILL SAY ANYTHING 
 
From  urlLink TalkLeft :

Last night George W. Bush said regarding the blackout:
 
We'll have time to look at it and determine whether or not our grid needs to be modernized. I happen to think it does, and have said so all along
 
Surprisingly, what Bush says has absolutely nothing to do with reality:
 
In June of 2001, Bush opposed and the congressional GOP voted down legislation to provide $350 million worth of loans to modernize the nation's power grid because of known weaknesses in reliability and capacity. Supporters of the amendment pointed to studies by the Energy Department showing that the grid was in desperate need of upgrades as proof that their legislation sponsored by U.S. Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA) should pass. [Roll Call Vote #169, 6/20/01].
 
Is it possible for Bush to be less honest than he is?  I don't think so.

       PENTAGON TO CUT 'IMMINENT DANGER' PAY FOR U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
 
Calpundit also has some  urlLink good thoughts  about  urlLink this story  which has to be a strong entry in the "what the hell are they thinking" hall of fame:
 
The Pentagon wants to cut the pay of its 148,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, who are already contending with guerrilla-style attacks, homesickness and 120- degree-plus heat. 
 
Unless Congress and President Bush take quick action when Congress returns after Labor Day, the uniformed Americans in Iraq and the 9,000 in Afghanistan will lose a pay increase approved last April of $75 a month in "imminent danger pay" and $150 a month in "family separation allowances."
 
While Bush vacations away, the Defense Department has decided that daily attacks are not really "imminent danger."  Read Calpundit's post, this is so mind-boggling I can't even figure out what to say.

Calpundit has a nice  urlLink post , including a map, about  urlLink this story  which states that the Taliban are now in control of a small area of land in Afghanistan near Kandahar.  It sort of contradicts the "we've got 'em on the run" message we keep hearing from Bush.  It would seem like a huge embarrassment to the Administration that the Taliban are making gains, but the mainstream media would actually have to report it for that to happen (Afghanistan?  that's soooo 2002).

       IMPENDING DISASTER IN IRAQ? 
 
I am not one to make dire predictions, and I don't want to be interpreted as rooting for something bad to happen, but it seems to me that there are a lot of signs lately that point to things in Iraq getting seriously worse.  I don't necessarily mean from a guerilla standpoint, but it feels to me like the stage is being set for large scale civilian unrest.
 
 According to the NYT, the situation in Basra  urlLink remains tense .  This had been an are of relative calm until recently when  urlLink riots broke out  over fuel shortages.  The British have been in control of Basra and the south and it was felt that they were better than the Americans at getting along with the populace.
 
 Similar fuel shortages  urlLink could cause problems  in the North.  The U.N. has said that it is a "near certainty" that there will be shortages of kerosene, which Iraqis in the North use for heat during the winter.
 
 There has also been  urlLink unrest recently  among the Shiites in Baghdad.  The Shiites had been somewhat of a voice of moderation and caution regarding the U.S. occupation, but that seems to be changing.  It also shows that dissatisfaction with the U.S. is widespread, not limited to Baathist remnants and "dead-enders" that, in the neocon fantasy world, are the only ones unhappy with the U.S. presence.
 
 There is  urlLink graffiti  on walls outside of Baghdad saying "Welcome to the Republic of Darkness and Unemployment"  That cannot be a good sign.
 
 In addition to the fuel shortages, basic services are still largely absent and the security situation remains  urlLink bad 
 
Also being reported today is that the Bush Administration has  urlLink rejected  the idea of going to the U.N. Security Council for to gain U.N. support, and troops from countries such as India and France, for the occupation.  So it is now up to the U.S. Military, under staffed and poorly supplied, to get the job done.  If widespread unrest develops it will be a disaster as many Iraqis would likely be killed, sparking further violence in a vicious cycle.  Perhaps I am being alarmist and things will settle down as living conditions improve.  But as I said below, if I were Bush, I wouldn't hang my hat on the neocon fantasy of Iraqi reconstruction and American troops being greeted as "liberators."

<date>13,August,2003</date>
<post>


       
       IS IT TIME FOR BUSH TO GO TO IRAQ? 
 
Even Thomas Friedman, the noted Iraq hawk, is  urlLink worried  about how things are going in Iraq:
 
It's a travesty that four months after the fall of Saddam, the main road in and out of the country is still not safe. It underscores how much the Pentagon's ideological reach exceeds its military grasp. All of America's friends in Baghdad say the same thing: I love your ideas, but my daily life — salary, electricity, security — is worse since you came, not better.
 
Now the hawks continue to try and spin the bad news from Iraq as generated by a liberal media that wants the reconstruction to fail.  However even the most optimistic would have to admit that the results are, at best, mixed.  Here's what I don't understand, why isn't Bush doing everything within his power to make sure that things get better quickly?  He has to realize (or at least Rove does) that if he is running for reelection on the heels of a failed reconstruction, or even in the setting of progress but with 120,000 American troops still there, he is in trouble.  If I were advising him (which I am not) I would tell him not to believe everything the neocons tell him.  The entire neocon vision depends on being able to fight wars with few troops and expended relatively few resources on reconstruction so that despite invading every country that looks at us wrong, the military is still ready and able to deal with emerging threats.  The neocons have an interest in emphasizing the successes in Iraq while downplaying the failures, while Bush's interest is (or should be) making sure things go well whether or not the truth strictly adheres to the neocon concept.
 
So the question then becomes: Does Bush have a clear idea how things are going?  If I were him, with my entire political career and legacy on the line, I would want to see for myself.  Maybe Bush needs to get a first hand look, otherwise he and Karl may be in for a nasty shock.

Fox News is also claiming that the  urlLink cover  of Franken's book is similiar to the  urlLink cover  of one of O'Reilly's books.  This,  urlLink according to  Fox, is:

       WHO ARE FOX NEW'S LAWYERS? 
 
The New York Times  urlLink reports  on some details of the brief filed by Fox News in their laughable lawsuit against Al Franken:
 
"Franken is neither a journalist nor a television news personality," according to the complaint. "He is not a well-respected voice in American politics; rather, he appears to be shrill and unstable. His views lack any serious depth or insight."
 
Never mind the obvious fact that many would consider that an apt description of Fox News (and it's main blowhard,  urlLink Bill O'Reilly ), but is that a legal argument?  If shrillness (or instability) were a reason to suspend someone's first ammendment rights, Fox, Limbaugh, Coulter and the rest would currently be out of business.  As for lacking depth or insight, this is the definition of Fox News.  I can only hope that the judge laughs this one out of the courtroom.

       FOX NEWS SUES AL FRANKEN 
 
Fox News has  urlLink filed suit  against Al Franken and Penguin Group to stop them from using the phrase "fair and balanced" in the title of Franken's upcoming book:  Lies and the Lying Liars that Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right .  I think someone should sue Fox News over the use of the phrase as false advertising since they are anything but fair and are clearly highly unbalanced.

       FUN WITH ACRONYMS 
 
ABC News  urlLink reports  that the 4th Infantry has launched a new offensive against supposed Saddam loyalists near Tikrit.  It is called  O peration  I vy  L ightning.  It makes me wonder if the whole country isn't actually on Candid Camera (from  urlLink Eschaton ).

       IN CASE YOU MISSED IT 
 
This  urlLink Washington Post article  published on Sunday details how the administration's rhetoric about the imminent nuclear threat posed by Saddam increased as the evidence was crumbling.  You really should read the whole thing because there is so much information about how the administration willfully misled the American public that it would take too much space to reprint it here.  This pretty much sums it up though:
 
The new information indicates a pattern in which President Bush, Vice President Cheney and their subordinates -- in public and behind the scenes -- made allegations depicting Iraq's nuclear weapons program as more active, more certain and more imminent in its threat than the data they had would support. On occasion administration advocates withheld evidence that did not conform to their views. The White House seldom corrected misstatements or acknowledged loss of confidence in information upon which it had previously relied.
 
If you listen carefully, you can hear Bush's credibility begin to crumble.

       JUST POLITICS? 
 
Here's an interesting quote from the Sunday talk shows:
 
I think a thorough misunderstanding of how complex the politics of Iraq are and continue to be; an inability to understand the decapitation theory -- that is, getting rid of the top types while the workers continue -- wasn't going to work.
 
In other words, the basic assumptions, whoever was making them, at State, at NSC, at Defense, simply were inadequate to begin with.
 
So who said this?  That crazy anti-war Howard Dean?  Dick Gephardt?  John Kerry?  Nope, it was  urlLink Richard Lugar  Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  The claims that all the criticism of Bush's Iraq policy is just politics from disgruntled anti-war types get more hollow by the day.

        CALIFORNIA CRAZINESS 
 
I haven't commented on the California recall up until now because, well, I haven't really had much to add.  But, with the events of the past few days, the situation has become so insane that I can't resist.  I generally didn't think to highly about a recall that was financed by a single person, that is going to cost the taxpayers of California $25 million they can ill afford, would distract from the real issues, and that sets a precedent to put our political system in a state of constant campaigning.  However I now feel that no matter what the damage to democracy, the entertainment value alone is going to be worth it.  There is no question that if I lived in California I would be voting for  urlLink Gary Coleman .  But it is not an easy choice.  How great would it be for  urlLink Arianna Huffington  to have that bully pulpit from which to attack Bush on a daily basis?  I mean even  urlLink Arnold , although he is a Republican, is pro-choice and supports gay rights and since I am from a state that had a governor who starred in  urlLink Predator  I feel other should have to share the experience.  My attitude has definitely improved since Darrel Issa, the right wing nutcase who funded the whole thing, dropped out of the race.  I assumed is was a reaction to Arnold entering the race, but Josh Marshall thinks the order came from  urlLink higher up .  Whatever happens, it is going to be a good show.

       BUSH'S PENTAGON OUT OF CONTROL 
 
You seriously can't make stuff like this up.  From  urlLink Newsday :
 
Washington - Pentagon hardliners pressing for regime change in Iran have held secret and unauthorized meetings in Paris with a controversial arms dealer who was a major figure in the Iran-contra scandal, according to administration officials.
 
The officials said at least two Pentagon officials working for Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith have held "several" meetings with Manucher Ghorbanifar, the Iranian middleman in U.S. arms-for-hostage shipments to Iran in the mid-1980s.
 
The administration officials who disclosed the secret meetings to Newsday said the talks with Ghorbanifar were not authorized by the White House and appeared to be aimed at undercutting current sensitive back channel negotiations with the Iranian regime.
 
"They [the Pentagon officials] were talking to him [Ghorbanifar] about stuff which they weren't officially authorized to do," said a senior administration official. "It was only accidentally that certain parts of our government learned about it."
 
So while Bush whittles away his presidency in Crawford, his administration and leading members of his party ( urlLink Tom Delay ) are out undermining his foreign policy and holding unauthorized meetings with Iranian arms dealers.  What could possibly be next.?

       KARL ROVE KILLED 30,000 SALMON 
 
According to  urlLink Earthjustice  commercial fisherman and environmental groups have  urlLink filed a request  for information on how The White House, and Rove in particular, exerted political pressure on government managers responsible for managing water levels in the  urlLink Klamath River .  The decision, which pits farmers who want the water for irrigation vs. the health of the river ecosystem and the salmon that breed there, resulted in the death of 30,000 salmon.  The allegations of undue political influence come from a Wall Street Journal article:
 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Rove reminded the federal managers responsible for the Klamath Irrigation Project that farming interests comprised the President’s political base and polling data suggested more water to them would achieve a favorable political result for the President and Oregon Republican Senator Gordon Smith.
 
Too bad salmon can't vote.

       STAR WARS FANTASY MEETING REALITY 
 
It looks like even The Pentagon is admitting that the missile defense system is in trouble.  Apparently The Pentagon has suspended the Boost Phase Intercept (BPI) portion of the program because the technology is "not mature enough."  Slate's Fred Kaplan  urlLink explains  in detail why the BPI is a crucial part of the entire missile defense concept.  Don't expect this to affect administration policy though, Bush doesn't let those pesky facts get in the way of what he believes.

       MORE ON THE RED STATES 
 
 urlLink Angry Bear  has crunched a lot of numbers on the state tax data discussed below.  Here is a  urlLink graph  demonstrating that in fact the Blue (Gore) states are subsidizing the Red (Bush) states.  Now this fact alone does not bother me, as wealthier states subsidizing poorer states would be the natural result of a progressive tax system, which I favor.  Angry bear puts it nicely (link via  urlLink Nathan Newman ):
 
The part that bothers me is hearing Ted Stevens (his state gets back over $1.50 per dollar paid in taxes), or Trent Lott ($1.78), or Bill Frist ($1.20) whine about government and taxation without acknowledging this basic point, and their role in contributing to it.  Dick Armey, on the other hand, may have a point: Texas gets back $.92 per dollar paid in taxes.
 
So the next time you hear for a call for the end of welfare from some Republican. . .

He is being held in Kuwait mainly because he has repeatedly told the CIA that there was no active WMD program and the much hyped aluminum tubes were  urlLink not for use in a nuclear wapons program .  It seems that the U.S. is holding him because he is not telling them what they want to hear and they don't want him able to tell his story to the U.S. Media.

       RED STATES REALLY IN THE RED? 
 
The  urlLink Tax Foundation , which I think is a pretty conservative organization, recently published a report on federal tax burdens and expenditures by state, and it is quite interesting.  The  urlLink first page  has a map of the U.S. showing each state's ratio of federal tax dollars spent to received.  So, for example, for every dollar California pays in federal taxes, it receives 77 cents in federal spending, whereas Mississippi receives $1.89 in federal money for each dollar it pays in federal taxes.  After looking at that map, look at the 2000 electoral college map  urlLink here .  Notice anything interesting?  Of the ten states with the highest ratio (Arkansas, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Alaska, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia and Hawaii) 8 voted Republican and 2 Democratic in the last election.  Of the ten states with the lowest ratio (California, Nevada, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey) 3 voted Republican and 7 Democratic.
 
So what does this mean?  I haven't yet figured out the full implication of this, but it is certainly interesting that the states that are helping to elect the tax cutting Republicans are the states receiving the most in federal money.  One could even say that the blue states are subsidizing the "self-reliant we don't need any federal government" red states.   urlLink Nathan Newman  has a nice  urlLink discussion  on his weblog:
 
Here's the irony. So-called "welfare states" like California and New York more than pay their way in the federal system. In fact, the surplus taxes they pay subsidize conservative states like Arizona, Mississippi, Idaho and other states that consistently vote to cut spending that benefits the states paying the taxes, while increasing spending on their own services-- all while not paying their fair share.
 
You might suspect that this imbalance is solely because states like New York or New Jersey have higher per capita incomes, so they are paying more taxes on equal federal spending. If that was all that was going on, that might just be solid redistribution of wealth from richer states to poor ones-- although that still the kind of policy denounced as "welfare" by the conservatives benefiting from it.
 
But it's more than that. On a per-citizen basis, many of those conservative states are not only paying less taxes per capita, they are receiving more spending. Check out page 9 in the main report for the expenditures per capita table. The average per capita spending by the government is $6326 per person. Some "red states" like Texas and Utah do receive less than that amount, but many like Kentucky, Mississippi and Wyoming receive much more.
 
So what about the self-reliant heartland where they know that the federal government is too big?  Just another big lie complements of the Republican Party.

       THE MOST HYPHENATED QUOTE EVER? 
 
From the  urlLink The Saint Paul Pioneer Press  today regarding the  urlLink possiblity  of the Minneapolis/St. Paul area making a bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics:
 
Boosters, however, have talked to St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly, who hosted an Olympic 2016 Development Team meeting at his office in March. Kelly spokeswoman Laura Mortenson called it a "rally-around-the-concept, wouldn't-it-be-great-if-it-happened-here" gathering.
 
On the website this was listed as their "Top Story" which means either it was a slow news day or someone there really likes hyphens.

       HAVE THEY NO SHAME? 
 
Josh Marshall's  urlLink column  in The Hill this week takes on the Republican's ludicrous charges of Anti-Catholic bias on the part of Democrats for blocking the nomination of William Pryor to the federal bench (never mind the fact that half of the committee Democrats that voted against pryor are  urlLink Catholic! ).  Pryor is an ultra-conservative who has proclaimed Roe v. Wade "the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history," and has also come under fire for his founding of Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA).  RAGA is essentially a scheme to extort large contributions from corporations that are being sued by states in return for the more favorable treatment they would receive from Republicans (for more info see  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ).  Pryor also gave  urlLink potentially false  testimony to the Judiciary Commitee regarding his soliciting of Tobacco firms.  This is just another demonstration of how far the extreme right will go, ethics be damned, to ram their agenda down the throats of this country.

       WHAT IS BUSH HIDING? 
 
Though much of the information contained in the classified sections of the 9/11 report has been  urlLink leaked , the Bush administration has steadfastly refused to release the blocked out sections.  It has been widely reported that the sections of the report implicate the Saudi government as having connections to the 9/11 highjacking plot.  However the  urlLink Saudis  as well as congressional  urlLink Democrats  and  urlLink Republicans  have all called for the sections of the report to be made public.  So what is Bush trying to hide?  This  urlLink article  by London Observer columnist and BBC reporter  urlLink Greg Pelast  suggests that portions of the report could be very embarrassing to Bush (thanks to Jano for the heads up):
 
. . .let me take you back to Midland, Texas, 1986. A young old man, George W. Bush, seems to have trouble finding oil. But he strikes it rich when his flailing drilling partnership is bought out by Harken Oil. Despite the addition of the business acumen of Bush Jr., Harken faces collapse; but is pulled from the brink by a cash infusion from a Saudi, Sheik Bakhsh. The money from Arabia has nothing to do, we must assume, with Dubya's daddy at the time holding the post of Vice-President of the Free World.
 
The Bakhsh booty continued a pattern of the young Bush being saved from his dire business decisions by a line of Sheik angels. His first oil company, Arbusto, going bust-o, was aided by the American financial representative of the bin Ladin family.
 
Seems like somebody should be investigating this. . .Oh I forgot, Republicans don't investigate other Republicans.

       THE LEFT STRIKING BACK -- SLOWLY BUT SURELY 
 
Having endured the onslaught of Right-Wing extremist commentators such as Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly bashing liberalism over the past several years, the left is slowly fighting back.  Al Franken, author of the classic  Rush Limbuagh is a Big Fat Idiot , has a new book coming out this fall entitled  Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them  (you can pre-order your copy  urlLink here )(Also, to see a hilarious head-to-head between Franken and Bill O'Reilly go  urlLink here  and fast forward to the 40 minute mark).  Eric Alterman's  urlLink What Liberal Media?  dispelled many of the myths of the so-called liberal media.  Most recently, Joe Conason,  urlLink columnist  at Salon.com and  urlLink The New York Observer , gave an  urlLink interview  to  urlLink buzzflash.com  about his upcoming book  Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How it Distorts the Truth .  Here are a few quotes from the interview:
 
Well, as far as I can tell, the Republicans, at least on Capitol Hill, are far more immoral, by their own standards, than the Democrats are. I have a list in the book -- I go through members of Congress on the Republican side, and other conservatives, because you mention Gingrich being kind of an outstanding example of people who practice the opposite of what they preach. I would challenge any of them to find me a list that long of Democrats who've done the same thing. They won't be able to.
 
 
There are certainly honest conservatives and honest Republicans. But when it comes to morality, they have been promoting themselves on the basis of the lie that they are morally superior in some way to their opponents. And that's just demonstrably false.
 
 
. . .our media has done a terribly inadequate job of exposing the hypocrisy. The reason I knew about all this stuff is because most of it's been reported somewhere. But at the commanding heights of the national media, the pretense of the conservatives to be moral and to be superior in virtue to their opponents is accepted -- it's not questioned. 
 
Looks to be some good reading coming out this fall.

How scary is that?!?  Just another example of what's at stake in this election and how screwed we will all be if Bush wins again.

       IS BUSH LOSING CONTROL OF HIS PARTY? 
 
Republican criticism of The President seems to be on the rise recently.  Conservatives such as  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  and  urlLink George Will  have recently questioned Bush's commitment to conservative principles (except, of course, where the religious right is concerned), and Michelle Goldberg of Salon.com recently published an  urlLink article  quoting many establishment Republicans as expressing alarm at the current direction of Bush's foreign and domestic policy.  Republican Senator John Warner, a staunch Bush ally,  urlLink lashed out  againt the administration on friday for cancelling a briefing session on Liberia, and Republican Senator Richard Shelby has  urlLink criticized  Bush for not releasing censored portions of the 9/11 report.  Recently Tom DeLay went to Israel with the sole purpose of  urlLink undermining  Bush's Middle East foreign Policy (one gets the impression that Washington politicians are more afraid of DeLay than Bush).
 
This presents two problems for Bush: 1.  It makes it harder for him to move to the center as he will undoubtedly try to do in the six months before the general election.  2.  If people from his own party are more willing to criticize Bush it suggests that they believe the poor planning for post-war Iraq, the lack of WMD's and the Yellowcake fiasco are taking a toll on his image, and they want to cover themselves.
 
It's a long way from the election (at this time in 1991, according to  urlLink Atrios ,  the only declared candidate was Paul Tsongas and Bush I was considered unbeatable), but at least there are signs of hope.

       HOMELAND INSECURITY 
 
As I noted below, the TSA this week quickly reversed a decision to scale back the Air Marshals program after coming under intense criticism from the media and congressional Democrats.  The initial decision to cutback the program only came to light after the Washington Post  urlLink reported  the internal memos it had obtained, and was on the same day the government warned of an increasing highjacking threat.  The TSA initially denied that there were any cutbacks, then later  urlLink admitted  that the story was true:
 
After first denying that air marshals would have been shifted, the Transportation Security Administration acknowledged Wednesday that schedules had been changed late last week. "Those actions were premature and a mistake by the people who were involved," the agency's spokesman, Robert Johnson, said. A source in the air marshal program said long-haul flights were put back into schedules over the past two days.
 
Now, the fact that the first instinct of a department in the Bush administration was to lie should come as a surprise to no one, but the real concern is: Where else are they trying to cut corners that we don't know about?  The TSA still has a $900,000,000 budget deficit and, despite the repeated claims by the Bush administration that massive tax cuts wont hurt homeland security, they are already laying off airport screeners.   urlLink Michelle Cottle  at The New Republic  urlLink puts it  better than I ever could:
 
Still, you have to wonder what would have happened if the TSA memos hadn't been leaked to the Post or congressional Democrats hadn't gone on the offensive. Or what if everyone had quietly swallowed the outrageous lies the TSA spun when initially backed into a corner? Clearly, the administration had no compunction about trying to cover its sorry, stupid ass when first confronted. Which makes me wonder what else they're up to over there. Still facing a $900 million budget problem, who knows what brilliant cost-cutting schemes these clowns are hatching?

       THE DEFECTIONS BEGIN 
 
From  urlLink CNN.com :
 
[Republican] Sen. Arlen Specter, an influential member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, cited Ashcroft's ties to White House political aide Karl Rove, who, at one point, had been accused of being the leaker -- a charge disputed by the White House. 
 
Asked whether Rove's history as a political advisor to Ashcroft during his gubernatorial and Senate campaigns were grounds for him to step away from the case, Specter said "recusal is something Ashcroft ought to consider." 
 
Who will be the next to break ranks?

       HYPOCRISY WATCH 
 
Yesterday Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman called the Democrat's request for an independent counsel to investigate the white house leak "bald-faced political hypocrisy" or something like that.  Well when Attorney General Janet Reno was investigating Al Gore's alleged misuse of White House phones for fund raising (surely a much more dastardly crime than revealing the indentity of a covert operative and endangering national security for political revenge), this is what then Senator John Ashcroft had to say (from  urlLink Atrios ):
 
October 4, 1997
CNN’s “Evans & Novak"
 
JOHN ASHCROFT: The truth of the matter is that if the law's been violated, we should be able to ascertain that.
We can, if we have an independent person without a conflict of interest…
 
ROWLAND EVANS: …The attorney general has shaved down all the allegations that Vice President Gore apparently down to one single allegation -- which telephone he used to make these fundraising calls from.
Do you really think that alone is worthy of a special prosecutor?
 
ASHCROFT: …you know, a single allegation can be most worthy of a special prosecutor.
If you're abusing government property, if you're abusing your status in office, it can be a single fact that makes the difference on that.
So my own view is that there are plenty of things which should have caused [Attorney General Janet Reno], a long time ago, to appoint a special prosecutor, an independent investigator.
We asked for that on March the 13th of this year in letters from Republican members on the Judiciary Committee. And she's in a bad position…
…The man who signs her check is the man that she's investigating, and she hasn't been very aggressive about it.
 
Hmmmm. . . . no bald faced hypocrisy there.

       IT'S THE PRIMARY STUPID!! 
 
Jonathan Chait over at  urlLink The New Republic  has started an anti-Dean blog entitled  urlLink Diary of a Dean-o-Phobe.   Andrew Sullivan thinks that this is  urlLink the beginning of deep Democratic panic  which is pretty absurd, but he's recovering from a cold so we'll give him a break.  Blogging today Chait writes:
 
The prevalent view of Dean is that he's actually a moderate who's running as a left-liberal.  . .
 
As a matter of substance, I'm honestly unsure whether this assessment will turn out to be true. (I'll get into that question later.) But if this is true, as a matter of politics, isn't this about the worst strategy imaginable? The trick is to get elected on an aggressive policy platform that comes across as centrist. That's what Bush did, smuggling a far-right agenda into the White House under the guise of a "compassionate conservative." 
 
Here's the problem with that statement:
 
 THIS IS THE PRIMARY, NOT THE GENERAL ELECTION!!!!!!!!! 
 
Let me repeat:
 
 THIS IS THE PRIMARY, NOT THE GENERAL ELECTION!!!!!!!!! 
 
Every candidate since the beginning of time, or modern politics (whichever came first), panders to the base during the primary and turns around and runs to the center during the general election.  Does nobody remember Bob Jones University?  Shouldn't a writer for The New Republic understand this concept?  Am I the only one?

       THNGS THAT SHOULD KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT 
 
Just a quick update on the status of Diebold, the company set to count your vote in 2004.  First, there was  urlLink this  article in the NYT in June:
 
"We found some stunning, stunning flaws,'' said Aviel D. Rubin, technical director of the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins University, who led a team that examined the software from Diebold Election Systems, which has about 33,000 voting machines operating in the United States. 
 
The systems, in which voters are given computer-chip-bearing smart cards to operate the machines, could be tricked by anyone with $100 worth of computer equipment, said Adam Stubblefield, a co-author of the paper.
 
But Certainly things have improved since June, right?  urlLink Well. . . 
 
Digital voting giant Diebold Election Systems took a staggering blow Wednesday as California officials reported that Diebold ran uncertified -- and in some cases untested -- software in all 17 counties where it counted votes in the state's last two elections. 
 
What began as a scandal in Alameda County swept statewide as every county served by Diebold realized its software was not state certified, and three counties, including Los Angeles, found that some of their software never had been tested by a federally designated lab. 
 
Marin and San Joaquin counties both used non-state-certified software. Marin also was using a different version of vote counting software than Diebold officials reported to the state, and San Joaquin was using different touchscreen software than the company reported.
 
Ok, but certainly a company entrusted with such an important task as ensuring the integrity of American democracy would have trustworthy employees to fix any problems, right?   urlLink Wrong again :
 
SAN FRANCISCO -- At least five convicted felons secured management positions at a manufacturer of electronic voting machines, according to critics demanding more stringent background checks for people responsible for voting machine software.
 
Voter advocate Bev Harris alleged Tuesday that managers of a subsidiary of Diebold, one of the country's largest voting equipment vendors, included a cocaine trafficker, a man who conducted fraudulent stock transactions and a programmer jailed for falsifying computer records.
 
But at least Diebols is not a partisan corporation, right?   urlLink Damn! 
 
COLUMBUS - The head of a company vying to sell voting machines in Ohio told Republicans in a recent fund-raising letter that he is "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year." 
 
The Aug. 14 letter from Walden O'Dell, chief executive of Diebold Inc. - who has become active in the re-election effort of President Bush . . .
 
We are so screwed.

       JOHN ASHCROFT - CRIMINAL? 
 
We know from the  urlLink Valarie Plame affair  that criminal activity in the Bush Administration is nothing new.  Thus the news that Attorney General John Ashcroft  urlLink broke campaign finance laws  during is failed senate run doesn't really surprise anyone.  This will no doubt be largely ignored by the media, so we'll just tuck it away for use later when the wingnuts try to cook up some democratic campaign finance scandal.

       UP IS UP DAY?? 
 
There must be something in the air today, or maybe it's the flu, but two noted conservatives, William Safire and Andrew Sullivan, seem none to pleased with our dear leader.  First, Safire  urlLink writing today  in the NYT, attacks the Bush administration's penchant for secrecy over the whole  urlLink energy task force issue .  The final paragraph sums it up:
 
If "freedom" is the word Bush and Cheney want as the hallmark of their administration, they should begin with freedom of information. 
 
Wow, such moral clarity.   urlLink Sullivan  is pissed about a couple of things.  On the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment , an issue near and dear to his heart, Sullivan, for once, finds Bush's evasion  urlLink annoying :
 
Does that mean marriage? Or civil unions? Or domestic partnerships? Or just ad hoc and fragile legal contracts? I don't know. All in all: a carefully tailored piece of obfuscation. It seems to me that, from this statement, we neither have an unconditional endorsement of the FMA nor an uncategorical defense of states' rights with regard to marriage. Bush wants to have it both ways. Or am I misreading this?
 
Now Sullivan later posts that he thinks that "the president has essentially refused to endorse the religious right's current effort to amend the Constitution."  If he thinks this he is naive.  There is no question that when push comes to shove Bush will endorse the FMA, THAT is what he said last night.  On Bush's apparent claims of fiscal conservatism on monday Sullivan  urlLink writes :
 
There are a few options here. Either I've missed something or the president a) doesn't know what he's talking about or b) he's lying. Let's hope I've missed something, shall we?
 
No, you haven't missed anything, the guy lies.  He lies everyday and usually several times a day.  Could Sullivan finally be coming around to this?
 
I doubt it.

       FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION 
 
Good old  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  posts a link to  urlLink this article  in The Hill which discusses the emerging rift in the GOP over Bush's inability to control federal spending.  When Dick Armey, former house majority leader and now a lobbyist, was asked if he was in trouble for writing an op-ed in the Wall street Journal opposing the medicare bill he said:
 
“[Hastert] understood where I was coming from and that a lot of people felt the way I did,” Armey told The Hill. “I made the night longer than it ought to have been. One of things we do in our party is appreciate freedom of expression.”
 
Later in the article the subject of Republican reps who voted against the bill comes up:
 
Republican aides said conservatives who voted against the bill, including Reps. Mike Pence (Ind.), John Culberson (Texas), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Roscoe Bartlett (Md.) and Jim Ryun (Kan.), would suffer for their votes against the Medicare bill.
 
Leadership aides said those members “can expect to remain on the back bench” in the months ahead. 
 
I guess when Republicans say "freedom of expression" they mean "freedom to do what the party leadership tells you to do."

       KERRY ON TERRORISM 
 
John Kerry gave a speech at UCLA about terrorism, the text of which is  urlLink here .  Certainly more thoughtful than anything Bush has had to say on the topic.  An excerpt:
 
 
We cannot win the War on Terror through military power alone.  If I am President, I will be prepared to use military force to protect our security, our people, and our vital interests. 
 
But the fight requires us to use every tool at our disposal.  Not only a strong military – but renewed alliances, vigorous law enforcement, reliable intelligence, and unremitting effort to shut down the flow of terrorist funds.
 
Sounds OK to me, but then he finishes with this paragraph:
 
 
I believe we can bring a real victory in the War on Terror.  I believe we must, not only for ourselves but for all who look to America as “the last best hope of earth.”  I believe we can meet that ideal – and that’s why I’m running for President. (quotation marks from original text)
 
The last best hope of earth??  What is this, some kind of cheesy sci-fi novel?  A little apocalyptic, don't you think?

       WHY DOES BOB NOVAK STILL HAVE A JOB? 
 
This is a question I have asked myself repeatedly.  Eric Alterman  urlLink agrees :
 
Novak's action served no patriotic purpose. Plame was not accused, or even suspected, of engaging in any form of illegal or immoral activity. There was no rogue CIA operation to be exposed or any compelling national interest to be protected. Novak was one of six journalists contacted by the White House in an attempt to weaken the credibility of Plame's husband, Joseph Wilson, and punish his act of dissent, but Novak was the only patsy who took the bait.
 
. . .his ass should be out the door in any self-respecting journalistic establishment, lest anyone get the idea that such behavior is condoned.
 
And send George "I am for sale" Will's ass out the door while they're at it.

       THE OTHER MARRIAGE AMENDMENT 
 
A letter writer to the Washington Post (via Sully) reminds us of another amendment proposed to the constitution.  This one was proposed by Rep. Seaborn Roddenberry (D-Ga.) in 1912.  It reads:
 
Intermarriage between negros or persons of color and Caucasians ... within the United States ... is forever prohibited.
 
In defense of his amendment he is  urlLink quoted as saying :
 
"Intermarriage between whites and blacks is repulsive and averse to every sentiment of pure American spirit. It is abhorrent and repugnant. It is subversive to social peace. It is destructive of moral supremacy, and ultimately this slavery to black beasts will bring this nation to a fatal conflict" (Gilmore, 1975, p.108).
 
That quote is so shocking that I debated whether or not to post it, but it is important to remember such sentiments as we face the anti-gay bigotry so prevalent today.  To read more about the historical context click on the link above.  The arguments certainly sound familiar though, don't they?

       THE REAL DANGER OF THE FMA 
 
Andrew Sullivan posts a letter from a  urlLink Republican Lawyer  who details why the FMA is so bad.  Not only is it gay-bashing, it is part of the religous right agenda to undermine people'e right to privacy.  Read it and weep for our country:
 
 
Now that opponents and proponents of gay marriage are all riled about the FMA its time to talk about the true impact of including a definition of marriage in the Constitution. The potential impact of inclusion of the FMA will effect every American straight or gay because the FMA is not about gay marriage, it is a dangerous Trojan Horse that could completely redefine the powers of the federal government. As an attorney who is researching this issue, let me explain to the best of my ability, why I haven’t been sleeping well since Tuesday.
 
 
Under the Constitution of the United States there is no express right to privacy, rather this right to be free from excessive government interference in our personal lives has arisen from Supreme Court precedent that cites the lack of regulation of intimate relationships and the protections of the bill of rights as the basis for an inference of the right to privacy. The right to privacy, according the Supreme Court is found in the penumbras and emanations of these two factors. A shadow of a right, very delicate and now threatened.
 
 
By including a provision regulating the most intimate of relationships into the Constitution, the traditional analysis that the court has used to limit government power will be fundamentally changed and the right to privacy, if it is not destroyed completely, will be severely curtailed. As a result, decisions like Roe v. Wade, (Abortion), Griswold v. Connecticut (Birth Control), Lawrence v. Texas (Private Sexual Acts), will all be fair game for re-analysis under this new jurisprudential regime as the Constitutional foundation for those decisions will have been altered. A brilliant strategy really, with one amendment the religious right could wipe out access to birth control, abortion, and even non-procreative sex (as Senator Santorum so eagerly wants to do). 
 
 
This debate isn’t only about federalism, it’s about the reversal of two hundred years of liberal democracy that respects individuals. So why isn’t anyone talking about this aspect of it? 
 
Why indeed.

       REPUBLICAN ECONOMICS 
 
The New York Times has a quote from Tom DeLay  urlLink discussing  why the GOP rejected a Democratic amendment that would have required any more tax cuts be offset by spending increases (to see how close it was and how they had to break the rules to do it, go  urlLink here .)
 
"We, as a matter of philosophy, understand that when you cut taxes the economy grows, and revenues to the government grow," Mr. DeLay said. "The whole notion that you have to cut spending in order to cut taxes negates that philosophy, and so I'm not interested in something that would negate our philosophy."
 
So there you have it.  GOP economic policy is based simply on their philosophy.  It doesn't matter if cutting taxes increases government revenue in  reality , as long as they hold true to their philosophy, nothing matters.  So I guess that, philosophically speaking, the deficit doesn't really exist.  This truly is faith-based economics.
 
We really need some adults in charge.

DAYTON, Tenn. - The county that was the site of the Scopes "Monkey Trial" over the teaching of evolution is asking lawmakers to amend state law so the county can charge homosexuals with crimes against nature.

Commissioner J.C. Fugate, who introduced the measure, also asked the county attorney to find a way to enact an ordinance banning homosexuals from living in the county.
 
"We need to keep them out of here," Fugate said.

WASHINGTON - President Bush (news - web sites) played host to dozens of overnight guests at the White House and Camp David last year, from world leaders to some of his most loyal supporters, including friends who double as campaign fund-raisers.
 
Bush and first lady Laura Bush have invited at least 270 people to stay at the White House and at least the same number to overnight at the Camp David retreat since coming to Washington in January 2001, according to lists the White House provided The Associated Press.
 
Some Bush guests stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom.

       THE POWER OF BLOGS 
 
Kos has an  urlLink interesting post  on how blogs have affected the political landscape.  He argues that the vast lefty blogosphere acts as a giant fact checking machine for Republican claims.  Since the Republicans rely on misinformation and deception in order for them to do one thing and say another, this is particularly important, especially since the mainstream media has been so pathetic about challenging the claims of the administration.  Now, they don't have to, they can just go to the blogs to get their info.  He uses as an example this  urlLink excellent post  regarding Bush's flip flops that was actually submitted by a reader.
 
For example, my reader-powered "Bush Flip Flops" post on Saturday hit Andrew Sullivan, WaPo and dozens, if not hundreds, of blogs today. In one fell swoop, we turned a GOP talking point against our candidate against theirs, and people outside of the blogosphere "echo chamber" were receptive to the message.
 
I didn't write that flip-flop post. Reader TK did. Yet it'll now be picked up by the party and other media outlets when "balancing" out the RNC spin points. We are on our way to neutralizing what might've been the GOP's strongest line of attack against Kerry.
 
So what can we do?  Read the blogs (some good ones are linked to on the left, there are many other excellent blogs as well), send links to your friends, particularly your Republican friends, spread the world.   Bush can be beaten, and perhaps in the process politics can be ever so slightly changed for the better.

       THE CASE AGAINST BUSH 
 
Slate's Will Saletan makes a convincing  urlLink case against Bush , and one that can be used to sway those who don't necessarily think Bush is dishonest anti-democratic hack.  The gist is that Bush is not necessarily a liar, but he simply cannot adjust his thinking as facts change, making him a lousy leader.  The Democrats should pay attention.  Money qoute:
 
He's too confident to consult a map. He's too strong to heed warnings and too steady to turn the wheel when the road bends. He's too certain to admit error, even after plowing through ditches and telephone poles. He's too preoccupied with principle to understand that principle isn't enough. Watching the stars instead of the road, he has wrecked the budget and the war on terror. Now he's heading for the Constitution. It's time to pull him over and take away the keys.
 
On another note, I can't remember where I heard this, but Bush's campaign theme "Steady leadership in times of change" would more accurately be stated "Don't change horsemen in the middle of the apocalypse."  I thought that was funny.

       A DANGEROUS GAME 
 
Many reports lately, such as  urlLink this one  from CNN, are talking about the big push to catch Osama Bin Laden.
 
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. forces searching for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden along the mountainous border between Pakistan and Afghanistan will soon implement high-tech surveillance tactics in the region, enabling them to monitor the area 24 hours a day, seven days a week, CNN has learned. 
 
Now this is all fine, and I hope they catch him, however several questions are raised.  The most obvious one is why have we waited so long to try really hard to catch him?  It wouldn't have anything to do with the upcoming election now, would it?  With all the hype in the press lately, they had better get him, because if he gets away Bush is going to look pretty sorry.

       HOW EXTREME ARE THE REPUBLICANS? 
 
At the behest of the bill's sponsor, Sen Larry Craig R-Idaho, the senate has  urlLink killed  a bill that would have protected gun manufacturers from certain types of lawsuits, 90-8.  Why, one might ask, would the republicans want to kill a bill that is a giveway to the gun manufacturing industry?  Because the Democrats managed to amend the bill extending the 10 year old assult rifle ban (something Bush supposedly  urlLink supports ) and requiring background checks for gun sales at gun shows.  Surveys  urlLink have shown  75% of Americans support the assault weapons ban, as well as %57 of GUN OWNERS!  And if background checks are required to purchase a gun in a retail store, what is the big deal about doing the same things at gun shows?  Yet the Republicans found these two seemengly common sense items, both amended by a majority of the senate, to high a price for their gift to the gun industry.  Can there be any question that this party is nowhere near 'moderate'?

       NUTCASES 
 
Today some shining examples of what the forces of the reactionary right are up to.  First from  urlLink Tbogg  we have Dr. Paul Cameron, founder of  urlLink The Family Research Institute  who explains to us the true, unspokedn dangers of homosexuality, a snippet:
 
Untrammeled homosexuality can take over and destroy a social system," says Cameron. "If you isolate sexuality as something solely for one's own personal amusement, and all you want is the most satisfying orgasm you can get- and that is what homosexuality seems to be-then homosexuality seems too powerful to resist. The evidence is that men do a better job on men and women on women, if all you are looking for is orgasm." So powerful is the allure of gays, Cameron believes, that if society approves that gay people, more and more heterosexuals will be inexorably drawn into homosexuality. "I'm convinced that lesbians are particularly good seducers," says Cameron.
 
Read the whole thing, it only gets better.

       NOVAK SHOULD BE FIRED 
 
Kevin Drum has a  urlLink post  today about Joe Wilson's book.  He links to another blog that recounts a discussion between Wilson and Novak prior to the infamous column.  You can read it for yourself, but what is clear is that Novak has no ethical standards whatsoever.  Similarly, where are the standards of the news organizations, particularly CNN, that continue to employ him?  We need to start some kind of campaign to pressure CNN and others to at least consider some kind of administrative leave pending the outcome of the Plame investigation.
 
We can start now,  urlLink email CNN .

       THIS IS DEPRESSING 
 
Two new polls this week  urlLink show  Bush now leading Kerry in the general election and on national security.  This is despite two weeks of terrible news from Iraq and Bush's horrendous press conference.  It is hard to fathom how Bush's approval goes up, and it is important to note that polls this early are not that meaningful.  I am waiting for  urlLink Ruy Teixeira  to explain to me why I should not be worried (where are you Ruy?).  However one cannot help but worry about the state of our country.  Josh Marshall offers  urlLink this explanation  which he is not quite sure about:
 
A contrary reading of these polls might suggest that the president gains as national security and war issues become more salient, even if they are becoming more salient because of what seem to be objectively bad news about his policies.
 
Another interpretation is that Bush has decided that as the leader of the most powerful country on earth it is his God-given duty to spread the almighty's gift of freedom throughout the world by blowing stuff up and killing a bunch of people, and about half the country is OK with that.
 
Like I said, depressing. . .does anybody know what winter in The Netherlands is like?

       FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION 
 
Read  urlLink this  now.  It shows that we have no idea what we a re doing in Iraq, and does not bode well for the future.  You have to read the whole thing, it is based on a memo written by a CPA official, but here is a snippet:
 
Iraq's chances of seeing democracy succeed, according to the memo's author—a U.S. government official detailed to the CPA, who wrote this summation of observations he'd made in the field for a senior CPA director—have been severely imperiled by a year's worth of serious errors on the part of the Pentagon and the CPA, the U.S.-led multinational agency administering Iraq. Far from facilitating democracy and security, the memo's author fears, U.S. efforts have created an environment rife with corruption and sectarianism likely to result in civil war.

       POLLS 
 
Now we all know that Bush's claim in his press conference that he didn't use polls to make decisions was laughable, but who would have thought it would be so quickly debunked, as pointed out by  urlLink Will Saletan  and  urlLink this NY Times letter writer :
 
"And as to whether or not I make decisions based upon polls, I don't. I just don't make decisions that way."
 
—President Bush, White House press conference, April 13
 
"It was no accident that President Bush passed up five chances on Tuesday night to offer regrets, contrition or an acknowledgement that he might have made mistakes in handling the Sept. 11 attacks or the war in Iraq. … One adviser said the White House had examined polling and focus group studies in determining that it would be a mistake for Mr. Bush to appear to yield."

       THE EUROPEAN 
 
This was posted in the comments section of Kevin Drum's Washington Monthly  urlLink blog  by 'The European.' 
 
As a non-American, I can only draw one conclusion as to why nobody seems to notice how moronic your Dear Leader is: Americans by and large are morons themselves. There's really no other explanation.
 
How can you Americans listen to this idiot and not throw up your arms in despair that a man so less-than-even-mediocre in every possible way is the leader of your country? The leader many of you voted for -- and will probably vote again?
 
In Europe we often vote for assholes, but almost never for village idiots. I still can't believe you Americans voted happily for the obviously Alzheimer-impaired Reagan. Then you voted for Bush, a man whose IQ is less than that of lint! Unbe-fuckin'-lievable! Would you actually choose an idiot for a doctor, for a teacher, even for a plumber? Then why for a president? I don't care what he stands for and whether he's "morally clear" and resolute. He is a fuckin' moron, for chrissakes! How can you expect a moron to do anything non-moronic? Even if he tries to implement issues you agree with, he'll royally fuck up. Just as Bush did, and will continue to do because many of you will vote for him again.
 
What a bunch of undereducated, uninformed, undiscriminating ninnies most of you Americans are! God save us from you. You have driven your country into the toilet, and, you know, it was your own free choice. America is over. The future is Europe.

       MORE EVIDENCE 
 
If you needed it about the mendacity of this administration.  Below I have posted a customer review of John Dean's book about Bush,  Worse Than Watergate  that was posted on the Amazon.com site.  The review can be found  urlLink here , I was directed to it by a commenter from Kevin Drum's Washington Monthly blog.  It speaks for itself.
 
Bush is mendacious, vengeful, and unpatriotic, April 12, 2004  
 Reviewer: Matthew Maly from New Haven, CT 
 
I salute John Dean for having written this book and find everything it it very believable and most important for all of us to know. 
 
Four years ago, I did what my contract with the US government expressly called for: reported my suspicions that a felony may have been committed in the course of administering a strategically important US grant. The Department of Defense (very reluctantly) conducted an audit that proved my main allegation: disappearance of $20M that caused the entire program to lose its functionality and eventually to close. 
 
After my letter was received, I was immediately blacklisted for US assistance positions, my bank accounts were frozen for seven months without any reason whatsoever, and my family was driven to penury, having to pawn all our possessions.
 
The program died quietly, most of its money stolen or mismanaged, but there is one thing left to do: take credit for this program's "success". In his recent speech at the National Defense University, Bush said, "We're helping former Soviet states find productive employment for former weapons scientists." Bush is referring to Defense Enterprise Fund (DEF), a venture capital fund financed by the US Congress. DEF was supposed to convert Russian WMD establishments while simultaneously realizing profit from high-technology joint ventures. Please use the words "Defense Enterprise Fund" if you wish to find the relevant website. 
 
According to the Audit that I forced the Department of Defense to conduct, having sacrifices my professional career, if not my life, for it, DEF spent half of its grant on itself, which is twenty five times the industry average. As far as DEF's investment portfolio of $30M, $20M disappeared from it under very suspicious circumstances, exactly as I alleged. 
 
Defense Threat Reduction Agency ("DTRA") maintains a DEF-related webpage. This page used to state that the number of former Soviet WMD scientists converted by DEF to peaceful pursuits was 3370. I questioned this figure and DTRA reduced it to 1250, which is a 66% reduction. But the real figure could not be more than 200 Russian scientists. This is how Bush tells you "the truth"! And these are precisely the scientists we wanted to keep away from Al Queda! 
 
DEF was closed as of December 31, 2003, its entire $67M grant lost, and nobody was punished, except the whistleblower. 
 
Remember the anthrax scare? Well, the world's biggest producer of militarized anthrax and small pox (even scarier), the Vector Plant of Novossibirsk, Russia, came to DEF asking for just one million to convert itself. But the money was already gone! Read the audit! $100K for a golf club, $150K housing allowance swindle, Concorde flights, and on, and on, and on - until all the money is gone! Does that look to you as conversion of the Russian weapons of mass destruction?
 
As DEF employee I did everything I could, in house, to prevent DEF's demise, and wrote my letter only when there was no other option. I wanted to save this program, save American lives, and because of it I am being destroyed, assassinated by this Administration. 
 
I am a Republican, and I like the idea of small government and individual liberties. But Bush is no Republican as he stands for Big Surveillance and an even Bigger Lie. If you care about America being secure from weapons of mass destruction, please remember my story when you vote in November.

It is worth remembering just how wrong they were about everything.  And yet they are still in charge, that's accountability for you.

       VINTAGE ANDREW SULLIVAN 
 
Having Andrew Sullivan  urlLink critique liberal talk-radio  is sort of like. . .well like Sullivan critiquing liberals!  But the obvious irony didn't stop Andy from using his Sunday Times column as a vehicle to repeat his tired and pathetic sweeping generalizations of "the left", which apparently were so ingrained in his Tory upbringing that he is rendered incapable of objective judgment.  Let's go to the tape.  He starts out, of course, by explaining why we liberals all miss the subtleties of Rush Limbaugh:
 
On conservative talk radio, where pontificators pound the table, rouse the "ditto-heads" who call faithfully in to echo the latest anti-liberal calumny, the irony is on mute. It's there, all right. Anyone who has ever listened to Rush Limbaugh infers the irony from his manner, his grandiose self-mockery which is expressed in unapologetic self-promotion. Limbaugh gets what camp is actually about: for all its silliness and hyperbole, it never lets down its pretense at being serious.
 
Ahhh the irony!  So you see when Rush peddles his lies about "liberals" and "feminanzis" it is all about subtle self-mockery, but on the other hand Al Franken. . .
 
. . .couldn't sustain the conceit for more than a sentence. He had to hear his own pomposity and prick it.
 
So I guess Al is just not pompous enough for Andy's tastes.  Not only is Franken not enough of a jerk, like Limbaugh, but on the whole liberals are just too honest for the kind of talk radio they need to be successful:
 
Educated liberals, after all, decry populism. A large part of their self-esteem is bound up in believing themselves better educated and more enlightened than the average person, certainly smarter than, say, George W. Bush. So actually getting on the air and engaging in irresponsible, shameless spin and ideology goes against the grain. Conservatives, in general, are happy to confess their biases.
 
The true villains, the evil, anti-populist, "educated" liberals that just think they are better than everyone else.  Apparently that is better than the educated conservatives in charge of the country who get around the whole populsim thing by simply maintaining populist rhetoric while pursuing decidedly pro-elite (wealthy) economic policies.  If it wasn't bad enough, he then laments the lack of debate among liberals in general and specifically the Democratic party:
 
And when you look at the political parties today, it's only the Republicans who are really still fighting over ideas. Only conservatives are battling each other over fiscal policy, or on abortion, or on gay marriage.
 
So let’s see: Gay marriage, where the Democrats seem to be unified on civil rights (as they have been for 30 years or so) and the Republicans are debating whether enshrining second class status of gays in the constitution is ok; fiscal policy where the debate in the Republican party is between massive deficits and slightly less massive deficits; and Abortion where the only debate seems to be what’s the best strategy for outlawing abortion, as opposed to the Democrats who have the audacity to be united behind a women’s right to choose.  
 
If the Republican party was debating whether or not the earth was flat it would technically count as a "debate," but given the choice I would take the intellectualy stagnant Democrats over Republicans debating the merits of religious fundamentalism any time.

       WORTH READING 
 
I don't really know much about Sterling Newberry, but  urlLink this post , although long, is worth the read:
 
Our leaders, if we were a defeated nation, would be sent to the Hague or some other tribunal for War Crimes prosecution. That we will not do this insures that our enemies, fortified by the clear bankruptcy of our laws, and our clear willingness to flagrantly break them when it is to our own advantage, and the complete and utter lack of accountability for those that break them, and those who enable breaking them - will strike, with devastating force, at the centers of our commerce and population. The will, rightly, point to the devastation of Baghdad as their reason for attack.
 
This underscores some salient points for the Democrats and some for our nation as a whole.  For the Democrats they need to start pointing out, as  urlLink Al Gore  did yesterday, that Bush's policies have increased the likelihood of a terrorist attack, and have helped Al-qaeda's recruiting efforts.  For our country, we have to realize that, like it or not, the world will view this election as a referendum on Bush's foreign policy.  Whether we are a nation that respects laws and international institutions or one that feels it can do whatever it wants because it has the biggest military, our moral superiority having been sucked into the sands at Abu Gharib. Again from Sterling Newberry:
 
Those are our only two choices: either we must uphold the laws that we ourselves have written, and exact the maximum punishments on those who have so nakedly broken them - or we must expect that others will write their own laws, judge us by them, and execute under them.
 
Indeed.

       CHALABIGATE 
 
You heard that term here first!  Interesting from  urlLink The Guardian :
 
An urgent investigation has been launched in Washington into whether Iran played a role in manipulating the US into the Iraq war by passing on bogus intelligence through Ahmad Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress, it emerged yesterday. 
 
Some intelligence officials now believe that Iran used the hawks in the Pentagon and the White House to get rid of a hostile neighbour, and pave the way for a Shia-ruled Iraq. 
 
According to a US intelligence official, the CIA has hard evidence that Mr Chalabi and his intelligence chief, Aras Karim Habib, passed US secrets to Tehran, and that Mr Habib has been a paid Iranian agent for several years, involved in passing intelligence in both directions. 
 
The CIA has asked the FBI to investigate Mr Chalabi's contacts in the Pentagon to discover how the INC acquired sensitive information that ended up in Iranian hands. 
 
The implications are far-reaching. Mr Chalabi and Mr Habib were the channels for much of the intelligence on Iraqi weapons on which Washington built its case for war. 
 
"It's pretty clear that Iranians had us for breakfast, lunch and dinner," said an intelligence source in Washington yesterday. "Iranian intelligence has been manipulating the US for several years through Chalabi." 
 
It's an anonymous source from The Guardian, so interpret carefully.

       SOUTH CAROLINA TO SECEDE. . .AGAIN 
 
From  urlLink WorldNetDaily: Christians look to form 'new nation' within U.S. 
 
Burnell is leading the charge for a peaceful secession of one state from the union, and after originally considering Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina due to their relatively small populations, coastal access, and the Christian nature of the electorate, Burnell says South Carolina has been selected as the target location. 
 
The plan initially calls for at least 12,000 Christians willing to be active in political campaigns to move to the Palmetto State.
 
[snip]
 
If all goes according to plan, Burnell is hoping to have a constitutional convention by 2014, with a president of the new nation – still to be known as South Carolina – elected in 2016, which is also a presidential election year in the U.S. 
 
He says the nation would be founded on Christian principles, and the people writing its constitution would have to hash out details to safeguard it as a Christian republic.
 
Change Christian to Muslim and you have Iran.

       FBI TO INVESTIGATE CHALABI LEAKS 
 
According to  urlLink Newsday  which quotes Time and Newsweek, and  urlLink Joshua Marshall :
 
An intelligence source confirmed to Newsday reports in Time and Newsweek that the FBI had launched an investigation into who in the administration had passed the classified material to his Iraqi National Congress.
 
So we now have two investigations into leaking of classified info by this administration.  Add this to the  urlLink exhaustive list  of other high profile investigations of Republicans and it is not a pretty picture.  This from the party that was to restore honor and integrity.  In the face of this they have the audacity to complain that Kerry's consideration of delaying acceptance of the nomination  urlLink is  "about John Kerry thinking the rules that apply to everyone else don’t apply to him" (a comment that almost made me spit my  urlLink Lindemans Bin 65  all over the TV).
 
This needs to be a much bigger story than it is right now.  A second investigation into leaks by the Administration, this time to someone whom the CIA has known had ties to Iran for years.  People need to make sure the media does not ignore this story, it is a scandal that will make Abu Ghraib look like nothing.  The Dems need to get tough to, throw that rules comment right back in their faces.  We cannot let Bush's new sagging  urlLink poll numbers  lull us into complacency, we know what they are capable of.

       A JOKE 
 
According to Kos,  urlLink this joke  is making the email rounds:
 
How many members of the Bush Administration are needed to replace a lightbulb?
 
The Answer is SEVEN:
 
one to deny that a lightbulb needs to be replaced
 
one to attack and question the patriotism of anyone who has questions about the lightbulb,
 
one to blame the previous administration for the need of a new lightbulb,
 
one to arrange the invasion of a country rumored to have a secret stockpile of lightbulbs,
 
one to get together with Vice President Cheney and figure out how to pay Halliburton Industries one million dollars for a lightbulb,
 
one to arrange a photo-op session showing Bush changing the lightbulb while dressed in a flight suit and wrapped in an American flag,
 
and finally one to explain to Bush the difference between screwing a lightbulb and screwing the country.
 
For now I will agree with Kos that this will be funnier when Kerry is president.

       THIS IS UNBELEIVABLE 
 
If Josh Marshall is right, this whole  urlLink Chalabi thing  could be huge:
 
This provides a key piece of background information on the reports from last night that the Defense Intelligence Agency has concluded that Chalabi's INC 'intelligence operation' was in fact a front for Iranian intelligence, filtering the US WMD disinformation prior to the war and sending highly classified American military intelligence to the Iranians since the beginning of the occupation.
 
A few questions the media needs to start asking:
 
1.  Were we deliberately fed false info by the Iranians in order to get us to invade their enemy?
 
2.  Who gave Chalabi such sensitive information?
 
3.  If the CIA knew Chalabi's intelligence chief was connected to Iranian intelligence, why was he still getting info (and money)?
 
If this stuff is even remotely true, this scandal should make Abu Ghraib look like a minor nuisance to Bush, well see what facts come out and if the media and the Democrats do their job.

       REPUBLICAN FANTASYLAND 
 
This comment from Bush's campaign manager in today's  urlLink NYT :
 
As the situation improves in Iraq and as the public focuses on the economic situation, you're likely to see improved numbers from a polling perspective
 
So as the situation in Iraq 'improves' Americans will focus on higher gas prices, higher health-care costs, stagnant wages, skyrocketing federal deficits with no real tax cut (polls show that  urlLink 76%  of people think their taxes have stayed the same or gone up, and that by a margin of  urlLink 62% to 34%  favor providing essential government services over tax cuts) Bush's approval will go up?
 
These guys are completely out of touch with reality, hopefully they will get a big dose of it in November.

       SULLIVAN GETS SOME MAIL 
 
This was the  urlLink email of the day  over at his blog.  I reprint it in its full glory:
 
"I'm afraid I have to agree with you on this one. I think that Bush's instincts are sound in the War on Terror, but the man is no leader. God, how I long for someone like Roosevelt, someone who can speak. And the fiscal policy is just a disaster.
 
Even so, and even as a lifetime Democrat, I am afraid that I will have to vote for Bush. I don't trust Kerry, and even if he put forth a decent alternative I would have no faith that he was sincere. How did the parties ever come to this, nominating such low quality candidates? There are people who impress me as better prospects: McCain, Giuliani, perhaps Edwards, but they seem to fade out of the picture for reasons I don't understand."
 
So let me get this straight.  This 'lifelong Democrat' believes that Bush has sound instincts in spite of the ongoing complete debacle in Iraq.  Fine.  Despite a 'wreck' of a fiscal policy he is willing to support a candidate who on every issue; environment, gay marriage, church-state separation, stands in stark contrast to the principles of the Democratic party.  Okay.  But we have the most dishonest, lie-their-ass-off administration in history and this lifelong Democrat is not sure Kerry is sincere??  Bullshit.  Either the letter is a hoax or someone is in deep denial.  And as to those reasons you don't understand, rewarding a complete failure with your vote is a good place to start.

       THE MIDEASTIZATION OF THE US 
 
Juan Cole, one of the best sources of info on Iraq, has a  urlLink must read essay  on his site today:
 
You really wonder whether the Bush plan to Americanize the Middle East isn't being turned on its head. We now have an unaccountable government not elected in accordance with the will of the majority of Americans, which victimizes critics like Joe Wilson and engages in torture. Bush and Co. are emulating the worst aspects of the military governments of Egypt and Yemen. They have no credibility to push the latter toward democracy.
 
This is a critical point that John Kerry needs to emphasize.  This administration's fundamental disregard for transparency in government undermines the foundations of our democracy.  The system of checks and balances the founding fathers carefully set up is under seige by Bush.

       RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT 
 
I know you knew that, but this is really impressive.  He, along with other conservative commentators, have likened the prisoner abuses in Iraq to  urlLink fraternity hazing :
 
CALLER: It was like a college fraternity prank that stacked up naked men -- 
 
LIMBAUGH: Exactly. Exactly my point! This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You of heard of need to blow some steam off? 
 
There's more. . .
 
LIMBAUGH: And these American prisoners of war -- have you people noticed who the torturers are? Women! The babes! The babes are meting out the torture. 
 
LIMBAUGH: You know, if you look at -- if you, really, if you look at these pictures, I mean, I don't know if it's just me, but it looks just like anything you'd see Madonna, or Britney Spears do on stage. Maybe I'm -- yeah. And get an NEA grant for something like this. I mean, this is something that you can see on stage at Lincoln Center from an NEA grant, maybe on Sex in the City -- the movie. I mean, I don't -- it's just me. 
 
Now my only hope here is that, because I think these pictures truly did offend most Americans, this kind of rheotric can only serve demonstrate how vulgar and extreme guys like him are.
 
Like I said, hope. . .

       THEY'VE LOST THEIR WILL 
 
George Will that is.  I don't usually read his condescending nonsense, but when a staunch conservative like will  urlLink turns on Bush  it is worth noting:
 
This administration cannot be trusted to govern if it cannot be counted on to think and, having thought, to have second thoughts. Thinking is not the reiteration of bromides about how "all people yearn to live in freedom" (McClellan).

Being steadfast in defense of carefully considered convictions is a virtue. Being blankly incapable of distinguishing cherished hopes from disappointing facts, or of reassessing comforting doctrines in face of contrary evidence, is a crippling political vice. 
 
That sound you hear is a house of cards slowly crumbling.

       WHO ARE THE TERRORISTS? 
 
In a story that was overshadowed somewhat by events in Iraq, militants in Saudi Arabia attacked an office  urlLink killing  five foreigners, including two Americans.  Presumably this is the work of Islamic extremists, but  urlLink Today's Papers  points us to a paragraph buried in the  urlLink LA Times story :
 
Crown Prince Abdullah gave a speech to Saudi dignitaries blaming "Zionists" for the anti-government insurgency. "It became clear to us now that Zionism is behind terrorist attacks in the Kingdom," the state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying. 
 
Excuse me?  The Zionists? This is supposed to demonstrate how comitted the Saudis, Bush's only remaining friends outside the Republican Party (and Ariel Sharon, although he can't be too happy), are comitted to helping combat terrorism?

THE ESSENCE OF TODAY'S LIBERALISM: "We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good." The "we", of course, are the Clintons. They know far better than you do how you should spend your money. Because they are morally better people than you are.
 
My Response:
 
That post has to be one of the most offensive, arrogant, pieces of bullshit you have ever written.  This claim by conservatives that liberals think they are morally superior (I think we know who constantly trumpets their moral superiority), and that somehow believing that government can play a role in making peoples lives better translates into we know how to spend your money better (bought lunch for a homeless person today?) is such disingenuous crap I am shocked to see someone I thought had a modicum of intelligence write it.  Meanwhile conservatives are happy to let the rich get richer while the poor eat their shit until society completely crumbles out from under them.
 
There can be an honest debate about our priorities and the role of government, but when people write shit like that it undermines any hope at reasonable discourse (did your irrational Clinton hatred get the better of you?)
 
To quote the Vice-President, of whom you are such a big fan:
 
Go fuck yourself.

      John Dean has an excellent  urlLink analysis  on the implications of the president hiring (or at least consulting with) an outside attorney:
 
This action by Bush is a rather stunning and extraordinary development. The President of the United States is potentially hiring a private criminal defense lawyer. Unsurprisingly, the White House is doing all it can to bury the story, providing precious little detail or context for the President's action.
 
Hmmmm. . .imagine the outrage if a Democrat president had hired a criminal attorney.
 
It is possible that Bush is consulting Sharp only out of an excess of caution - despite the fact that he knows nothing of the leak, or of any possible coverup of the leak. But that's not likely.
 
On this subject, I spoke with an experienced former federal prosecutor who works in Washington, specializing in white collar criminal defense (but who does not know Sharp). That attorney told me that he is baffled by Bush's move - unless Bush has knowledge of the leak. "It would not seem that the President needs to consult personal counsel, thereby preserving the attorney-client privilege, if he has no knowledge about the leak," he told me. 
 
I guess this is all part of his plan to restore honor and integrity to the White House.

      The source,  urlLink Capitol Hill Blue , is not the most reliable but this article is just  urlLink too much fun  not to blog:
 
President George W. Bush’s increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately express growing concern over their leader’s state of mind.
 
In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media, Democrats and others that he classifies as “enemies of the state.”
 
Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge, increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.
 
[snip]
 
In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to talk off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has emerged, led by a man who declares his decisions to be “God’s will” and then tells aides to “fuck over” anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration.
 
Read the whole thing, it's good stuff, but unfortunately probably in the too good to be true category.

       BOYCOTT MICKEY KAUS 
 
I have read that pathetic hack's blog for the last time.  My letter:
 
Mr Kaus,
 
While I have stopped regularly reading your weblog due to a complete lack of intellectually stimulating content, I happened to come across your post today attempting to revive the Alex Poiler smears.  The depths to which you will sink in order to attack John Kerry seem to know no bounds.  Since your attempts to repeat the media lie that Kerry is a flip-flopper are so routinely exposed by other bloggers as pathetically dishonest, you now have to engage in Drudge-like mud slinging.  Perhaps this will increase the hits to your blog, but it only reinforces the notion that you are incapable of even a shred of intellectual honesty in your shrill Kerry bashing.  Our country is facing serious problems and your attempts to constantly smear Kerry without any context to the larger issues has demolished any shred of credibility you once had.

      concerning Brooklyn Park, MN, a nearby suburb,  urlLink this quote  shows a little "bush-like" marketing style, eventually:  "Dick Gunderson, a colorful 62-year-old sports bar owner, is the heart and soul of the city's new Density Reduction Task Force, a group exploring ways to possibly eliminate many of the 6,500 apartment units that house a large part of the city's rising minority population.  'I do not have any diplomatic skills, and I can't work with a group,' the always matter-of-fact Gunderson admitted recently. He remains certain of one other thing as well: 'We need to make changes.' In a sign that the group's work is already stirring strong emotions, the task force voted Tuesday to change its name to the less incendiary-sounding Apartment Housing Enhancement and Dispersal Task Force: AHEAD"   It's a tough issue, but it seems to me the market dynamics have to be massaged to get the right compromise.  Soliciting a few metro partners, requiring collectively that replacement affordable housing be included in the next  X  number of units built in those areas.  Hopefully you achieve relatively little permanent relocation, you insert some job training and participation among any local citzens willing to organize themselves well and achieve a more moderate density neighborhood with a few amenities.    this is another good candidate target for federal seed money that is otherwise being given away in a ridiculous tax break and the federal deficit program of this administration.

Though stretching the truth is hardly new in a political campaign, they say the volume of negative charges is unprecedented -- both in speeches and in advertising. "   Once again, I say, those of us for change HAVE to help Kerry get out the message that TRUST and TRUTH and FAIR DEALING is what he can deliver.  Not a difference in policy just to have a difference in policy, TRUST.

      There have been a couple of instances just recently to hear Kerry speak on and have his views on foreign policy reported in the press.  This article is helpful.  I'd suggest passing it on since what we lack most in trying to elect a liberal candidate is a true understanding of many of these complex issues.  Granted, this is a New York Times story.  more below.....    urlLink Quote of John Kerry in the Times article... : "'This administration is high on rhetoric and high on ideology and low on actual strategic thinking and truth,' he asserted. 'This administration has been almost myopic in its view on Iraq itself, to the exclusion of those things that are necessary to in fact make the world safer.'"   There's also this quote,  urlLink same article,    "That could fuel one of the primary complaints about Mr. Kerry among Democrats: that his approach to major foreign policy issues is too similar in substance to Mr. Bush's, even if he promises a new style that emphasizes alliance-building."   Attempting to distinguish himself on every detail could be dangerous, and "he said she said" is too....We HAVE to help John Kerry make the point that TRUST in carrying out the assignments granted the President by the people of the United States is what is missing in this administration, and is what HE, John Kerry, will restore.  then, let 'em rip with their right wing character assasination machine...I think Kerry's up to the task.  I think people are sick and tired of the mean-ness. If he can stay above it, he's in.

      finally, some serious media introspection, along with a lot of great issues raised in  urlLink this editorial by Paul Krugman     A few notable excerpts:   "People who get their news by skimming the front page, or by watching TV, must be feeling confused by the sudden change in Mr. Bush's character. For more than two years after 9/11, he was a straight shooter, all moral clarity and righteousness.  But now those people hear about a president who won't tell a straight story about why he took us to war in Iraq or how that war is going, who can't admit to and learn from mistakes, and who won't hold himself or anyone else accountable. What happened?  The answer, of course, is that the straight shooter never existed. He was a fictitious character that the press, for various reasons, presented as reality. "   We HAVE to begin to recognize just how influential the press is in painting a picture...and how easy it is for everyone to be hoodwinked by good PR.  We must remain critical, yet respectful.   Next quote:    "The Bush administration, knowing all this, played the press like a fiddle."   yes, but the press, as Krugman points out, was perfectly willing to be played like a fiddle....my concern is that only in retrospect after things have gotten SO bad does the press start to question itself.  what about the longer term?  what about early on in the situation?  But, finally, :   "Amazing things have been happening lately. The usual suspects have tried to silence reporting about prison abuses by accusing critics of undermining the troops — but the reports keep coming. The attorney general has called yet another terror alert — but the press raised questions about why. (At a White House morning briefing, Terry Moran of ABC News actually said what many thought during other conveniently timed alerts: "There is a disturbing possibility that you are manipulating the American public in order to get a message out.")  It may not last. In July 2002, according to Dana Milbank of The Washington Post — who has tried, at great risk to his career, to offer a realistic picture of the Bush presidency — "the White House press corps showed its teeth" for the first time since 9/11. It didn't last: the administration beat the drums of war, and most of the press relapsed into docility.  But this time may be different. And if it is, Mr. Bush — who has always depended on that docility — may be in even more trouble than the latest polls suggest."   we can only hope.

      This text, while a little long, is some great detail on the allegations against Halliburton and Cheney's continued and obvious ties.  The information is from John Kerry's  urlLink media corps website .  Since the items are footnoted, I have posted them as written with the qualification that I haven't vetted the sources.     Last week reports confirmed, once again, that the Bush administration has not been telling us the truth about how Halliburton has spent our tax dollars.  A House Committee found that Halliburton has wasted at least $1 billion in tax payer money on military contracts in Iraq, due to poor planning and oversight. [Detroit Free Press, 6/16/04]   Cheney's History of Employment at Halliburton   Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton from 1995-2000.   Halliburton's board of directors voted to give Cheney a $20 million retirement package when he resigned, in addition to providing him with a massive salary and a bonus for just eight months of work in 2000.   Following his departure from Halliburton, Cheney retained possession of 433,333 options of Halliburton stock.   Although Cheney insisted that he severed his financial ties to Halliburton, the Congressional Research Service recently released a report saying that federal ethics laws consider both Cheney's deferred compensation and his stock options as lingering financial interest in the company.   Halliburton's Contract with the Federal Government    The Pentagon knew it would need help after the war rebuilding Iraqi oil fields and putting out oil field fires.  Rather than following normal procedure and asking companies to bid on the job, the Pentagon turned the entire project over to Cheney's former firm, Halliburton.  The Army Corps of Engineers said that Halliburton's compensation for rejuvenating Iraq's oil industry could be up to $7 billion.  In postwar Iraq, Halliburton is the largest private contractor, with potential deals totaling over $11 billion.   Last September, Cheney said that he did not influence the decision to award Halliburton a no-bid contract: "I have absolutely no influence of, involvement of, knowledge of in any way, shape or form of contracts led by the [Army] Corps of Engineers or anybody else in the federal government." Since then, we have learned that Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, received a Pentagon briefing in October 2002, one month prior to directing Halliburton to develop a secret plan for restoring and operating Iraq's oil infrastructure.  The vice president's office was also made aware of a second contract worth up to $7 billion awarded to Halliburton four months later for implementing this plan.   Time Magazine uncovered an e-mail indicating that the $7 billion contract awarded to Halliburton was "coordinated" with Cheney's office.    Halliburton's Waste   Waste Due to Bush Administration's Lack of Oversight.  David M. Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, testified that Defense Department planners had failed to adequately determine the needs of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and to effectively oversee the billions of dollars' worth of contracts issued. [Los Angeles Times, 6/16/04]  Halliburton Wasted $186 Million on Meals Never Delivered.  Halliburton billed the government for 36 percent more meals than were served, overcharging $186 million. [Detroit Free Press, 6/16/04]   Lavish Hotels, Abandoned Trucks, Inflated Gas Prices.  A Halliburton's subsidiary was also criticized for abandoning $85,000 trucks with flat tires, housing company officials in a five-star Kuwaiti hotel, overcharging for gas it imported into Iraq from Kuwait, and ordering empty trucks to crisscross the country. [Detroit Free Press, 6/16/04]   Halliburton Reaped Profits While Forcing Troops To Eat In Filthy Conditions. According to NBC News, "Pentagon inspections of mess halls run by KBR are finding a mess in some of them...  In the main Baghdad dining facility where President Bush surprised the troops on Thanksgiving, inspectors found filthy kitchen conditions in each of the three previous months.  Complaints filed in August, September and again October report problems.  Blood all over the floor of the refrigerators, dirty pans, dirty grills, dirty salad bars, rotting meats and vegetables.  In October, the inspector writes that Halliburton's previous promises to fix the problems have not been followed through and warns the company serious repercussions may result, due to improper handling and serving of food." [NBC News, 12/12/03]   Now I mean come ON, how long are we going to stand for this?  Stockholders in any  other company, and citizens of the USA, should be outraged at the crass, in our face robbery that is being perpetrated here.

      Corporate greed...as if we weren't being robbed already by our politicians through the federal tax system on behalf of their business buddies, in the recent double week New Yorker James Surowiecki talks about corporate perks: "At most large American companies, rank still has its privileges; the big shots need not trouble themselves with paying for the things that their immense salaries are supposed to enable them to afford." While that seems to me to speak for itself, Surowiecki goes on to review economic literature showing how firms that still offer perks substantially underperform their peers...    (duh!!)   He closes with the following:  "Why do perks endure?....it's largely beause most C.E.O's will take whatever they can get.  It is hard for them to say no when their boards of directors keep saying yes."  SO, once you have the CEOs, their board, AND the political establishment all getting together on their own greedy behalf, is it any surprise that the rest of us are working our tails off just trying to keep afloat.    You are likely a shareholder....you are surely a voter.  YOU MUST TAKE ACTION NOW!!!!  Soon, there will be nothing left for us.

The White House prevailed on House conferees to strip the Leahy amendment from the final version of the Iraq spending bill.  The Leahy Amendment may come to a vote on Wednesday, June 16.  Contact: David Carle, 202-224-3693.]"    This amendment DID come to a vote and was defeated 52-46 along partisan lines.  Norm Coleman (you can contact him  urlLink here  to tell him what you think) voted against the amendment.    Check out the amendment page (link above.)  In addition to the fact that the Senate defeated it this time, it was PASSED by the Senate last time but was stripped under intense pressure from the   WHITE HOUSE  .    Just because they're not stepping out of an alley with a gun in your face   DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T CROOKS.....THEY ARE STEALING OUR MONEY   and we are letting them.

       urlLink This quote  also seemed instructive (see earlier Roosevelt quote below):  "'Men with the muckrake are often indispensable to the well-being of society, but only if they know when to stop raking the muck.' 'An epidemic in indiscriminate assault upon character does not good, but very great harm.' 'There should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil practice, whether in politics, in business, or in social life. I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform, or in book, magazine or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful.' Washington, DC, April 14, 1906"  So, the truthful part seems to have been missed by the Bush administration AND re-election campaign completely.  However, I do note that the internet, 24 hour news cycle and similar tools of information velocity make knowing what is true and what is SPIN more and more difficult.  One either ducks it all and remains uninformed, or one must commit oneself to digging for the truth. Unfortunately, I expect most people are caught in the flooded torrent of this river of information, holding for dear life onto a branch or stump of personal principle with which to pull themselves from the water.  We have to help.

       urlLink From Theodore Roosevelt  :  "'The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else.'  'Roosevelt in the Kansas City Star', 149 May 7, 1918"  Of course, he also said things that can loosely be translated as "stay the course" so one has to be careful, but I certainly liked this sentiment.  Without going on at length here today (it is a beautiful Sunday after all and I have to talk with my FATHER), between being PC and being a patriot, one might as well have just worn a muzzle for the last 15 years.  This is not how to run a democracy. Hope you are all talking straight to someone.

       urlLink This article  from the  urlLink New York Times  is very disturbing:  "President Bush's re-election campaign took its effort to enlist churches in turning out conservative voters to the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention this week, urging pastors to do everything short of risking their churches' tax-exempt status to support the president's re-election."   You'll see an earlier post from me on this page discussing Dennis Hastert's attempts to broaden the rhetorical space in which the clergy can participate in overtly partisan politics without risking their 501(C)3 tax-exempt status (which Hastert tried to do by tacking the provision onto the end of a  JOBS  bill.)  We  have  to understand how important this is.    The federal tax-exemption saves the operation over 30% (assuming an average tax bracket); this in and of itself could be considered a breach of the separation of church and state as foregone federal income can easily be seen as federal dollars supporting religious institutions.  It is CRUCIAL, then, that the rules governing how and whether such entities participate in politics require non-partisanship, be strict, clear and sufficient to maintain this constitutionally guaranteed separation of church and state.  I have participated in numerous voter registration initiatives in the past few months, most sponsored by non-religiously affiliated non-profits (also benefitting from 501(C)3 status.)  These organizations are bending over backward to be nonpartisan, so as not to attract the criticism of....you guessed it, the Republicans.  How more duplicitous can the neocons be....I ask you.    More quotes from the same story....how can the two following this be adequately resolved in terms of separation of church and state....anybody?(my emphasis added in the following)...     Mr. [Ralph] Reed delivered his remarks at a Bush-Cheney "pastors reception," paid for by the Bush campaign. The hosts were the departing president of the Southern Baptists and three other prominent leaders, and the reception was in a conference room of a hotel adjacent to the convention. As the pastors came in, a campaign aide collected about 100 signatures and addresses from ministers pledging to endorse Mr. Bush's re-election publicly, to "host a citizenship Sunday for voter registration," to "identify someone who will help in voter registration and outreach" and to organize a  " 'party for the president' with other pastors"  on specific dates closer to the election.  As the pastors mingled around fountains of soft drinks and trays of cubed cheese, Mr. Reed urged,  "Without advocating on behalf of any candidate or political party , you can make sure that everyone in your circle of influence is registered to vote."

      As my good friend put it most eloquently:   ".........yet another example of selective Reagan memorializing. As the bloggers have so eloquently pointed out, Ronald "Ray Gun" Reagan presided over some of the largest tax increases in U.S. history a few years after his initial tax cut (a move that was largely necessary due to massive budget shortfalls). In addition, Reagan's policies caused massive deficits and strain on the financial markets years afterward. On side note, despite the rash of ill-advised political commentary as of late, Reagan did not, by any objective measure, "preside over the largest period of U.S. growth in history." I won't even go into the Star Wars defense system, the October surprise, his ignorance of the growing AIDS epidemic or the Iran Contra scandal. In short, Reagan was the best president in the history of the Universe...just like George Bush."

However, read this quote:....  "Tenet is blamed for exaggerated claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction (WMD). He has been especially taken to task for a comment in the Presidents 2003 State of the Union address, vetted by the CIA, in which Bush stated, erroneously, that Saddam?s government had purchased uranium from an African country. "  and tell me how heavy the pressure was from W. himself and his war-profiteering partner Dick Cheney to find the pretense for war.    Tenent may not have been fully capable as CIA director, and not to have resigned in protest for staging an illegitimate war is an error on his part, but to exonerate the "President" and his cabinet from primary responsibility would make us all complicit in this international crime.

      Hendrick Hertzberg, in the  urlLink The Talk of the Town , says the following: "The President will still outspend Kerry by something in the neighborhood of two to one, which may or may not be enough. Republicans will probably always have more money than Democrats, no matter how many reforms are introduced into the system, because Republican policies (in general, broadly speaking, with exceptions and caveats) favor large agglomerations of money. Democratic policies (in general, broadly speaking, with exceptions and caveats) favor large agglomerations of people. That’s why Democrats, though they have fewer dollars, are sometimes able to get more people to vote for them, and sometimes (the last Presidential election being a conspicuous exception) getting more votes enables you to win. Dollars don’t always trump people. That’s the beauty of democracy, when it works."   This is why voter registration matters.  It's like the way Clinton attacked racial equality....helping the  economically  disadvantaged also helps a strong majority of people of color.  Getting new people registered will get democrats elected.

       urlLink This  from Krugman in the Times today:  "It's a measure of how desperate the faithful are to believe in the Reagan legend that one often reads conservative commentators claiming that the Clinton-era miracle was the result of Mr. Reagan's policies, and indeed vindicated them. Think about it: Mr. Reagan passed his big tax cut right at the beginning of his presidency, and mainly raised taxes thereafter. So we're supposed to believe that a tax cut passed in 1981 was somehow responsible for an economic miracle that didn't materialize until around 1997. Apply the same timing to the good things that happened on Mr. Reagan's watch, and you'll discover that Lyndon Johnson deserves the credit for "Morning in America."  So here's my plea: let's honor Mr. Reagan for his real achievements, not dishonor him — and mislead the nation — with false claims about his economic record."    now, the nexus of marketing, spin, exaggeration, selective information etc. is not new, nor is it the blight of any one political party or group; as a nexus it is also large, nebulous and grey, subject to exploitation of our trust in and respect for one another.    This administration, with Reagan as its homepage, Clean Skies Initiatives, and claims of WMD has clearly, consistently and deliberatly crossed even this vast grey area to abuse the trust of the American people.  We have also lost the trust of the world, along with their sympathy following 9/11.    Trust and respect among us.  Let's at least get back into the grey area.

Torture - that's our Department of 'Justice' - they say `It's OK to torture people.' What's the Department of Education doing? Burning books?"   and from Jon Stewart, some of the best stuff:   "Still, as tough as the week off will be on Kerry's campaign, the hiatus will be hardest on presidential hatchet man Karl Rove, who will be spending the week kicking puppies and tripping blind kids in order to, quote, `Stay sharp.'"

      I have been thinking and talking more and more about of church and state.  I will have to ponder it on this page for a few days at least to get some grip, but bear with me.  From  urlLink Josh Marshall  this quote from the  urlLink washington post :  "House Republican leaders have tacked on to a major jobs bill a provision that would give religious leaders more freedom to engage in partisan politics without endangering the tax-exempt status of their churches"    now i understand better Hastert's card in the Bush House of Cards deck that I have.  The ways in which the conservative right is leveraging their belief system to impose their belief system through the political system is blatant, yet insidious.  I can't even get a grip on the number of things that this administration has done administratively, i.e. through rule changes, etc., to dismantle so many systemic protections, environmental for example, and to construct so many more barriers to the fair and free participation of our citizenry in a secular society.  we need to be  VERY  concerned about this.

      from Krugman  urlLink in today's NYTimes :  "...the leaked memo points us to a larger truth: whatever they may say in public, administration officials know that sustaining Mr. Bush's tax cuts will require large cuts in popular government programs. And for the vast majority of Americans, the losses from these cuts will outweigh any gains from lower taxes."   i also understand that aside from the disastrous effect on our domestic programs and social and economic justice, there is no precedent in human civilization for a tax break while at war.    and, yes, AGAIN, dishonesty as a central theme (same article):   "For most families, the losses from these cuts will far outweigh any gain from lower taxes. My back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that 80 percent of all families will end up worse off; the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will soon come out with a more careful, detailed analysis that arrives at a similar conclusion. And the only really big beneficiaries will be the wealthiest few percent of the population.  Does Mr. Bush understand that the end result of his policies will be to make most Americans worse off, while enriching the already affluent? Who knows? But the ideologues and political operatives behind his agenda know exactly what they're doing.  Of course, voters would never support this agenda if they understood it. That's why dishonesty — as illustrated by the administration's consistent reliance on phony accounting, and now by the business with the budget cut memo — is such a central feature of the White House political strategy."   Dishonesty is now an official political strategy.  Are we all completely asleep?  Do we really have that little respect for ourselves and each other?

As tough as he is, his comments still fail to describe the hideous and despicable way the mainstream media is covering this presidential race:  "The failure of TV news to inform the public about the policy proposals of this year's presidential candidates is, in its own way, as serious a journalistic betrayal as the failure to raise questions about the rush to invade Iraq."   If you watched CNN's coverage last night of Kerry's acceptance speech, you would have witnessed one of the most biased, poorly executed and trivial coverage of a nominating speech in history.  They crossed audio feeds, broadcasting the Dem. event director ordering the balloons to drop...and when they didn't, CNN didn't turn off the guy's mike, cut to another scene, or anything..they just let it play, and then the anchors got on to talk about the balloons.    WHO GIVES A FLYING F*** ABOUT BALLOONS.  THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL RACE.   Please boycott CNN.  In fact, don't do that.  Write them a letter and tell them just how surprised you are to find out that they hang out with the editorial staff of the National Enquirer.

      The  urlLink New York Times  has an  urlLink article today  discussing the many ways in which the 9/11 Commission report sets the record straight about the terrorist attacks, saying, in part:  "...in its most contentious effort to set the record straight about the origins of the plot, the bipartisan commission's final report found no evidence of close collaboration between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, appearing to undermine a justification for the Iraq war."  I don't think anyone would have been able to prevent some sort of attack; the attackers were well planned, and we are not willing to give up our open society to the degree necessary fully to prevent such an attack.   What this article does very well is expose the Bush Administration for what it is: a self-centered, self-righteous group of people who think they know everything. Even when they've been proven NOT to know everything, they continue to claim that they do (Dick Cheney, Condi Rice to name two in the article). This cannot be excused as situational ignorance, "resoluteness" or anything of the sort. These people&nbsp;are lying to the American public to protect their ability to tighten their grip on power. This behavior is nothing short of that which we have seen in any fledgling dictatorship.   In a democracy, freedom of information and truth should underlie our freedom to choose our leaders.   This is the choice we face in this election: do we want to restore a democracy here? or do we feel more safe in a dictatorship? The latter choice could be one we live with for a very long time.

      This is a NYTimes editorial in its entirety (but it's short). It is important to read. After you read it, write a letter or email to any one or all four of the mentioned sitting Senators. They represent a reasonable voice on a potentially disastrous event on the horizon. Let's try&nbsp;to get in front of it. The link to the editorial is  urlLink here :   "For all the late-blooming talk of fiscal responsibility from Republican moderates, an election year cave-in is shaping up in the Senate as the White House pushes for a fast renewal of some of the 'temporary' tax breaks set to expire this year. Unlike the administration's giveaways to the wealthy, these cuts are among the more worthy and politically risky to oppose: extending tax relief for married couples, for families with children and for taxpayers in the lowest bracket, 10 percent.    But the issue is not the virtue of the cuts but whether Congress should be forced to make up the cost with spending reductions or - great idea - by increasing taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes for corporate taxes. Until now, four Senate Republicans have been standing with the Democrats, demanding an end to the administration's binge of record budget deficits and detaxation. Two of the Republicans, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, have indicated support for the tax-cut extensions without their usual stipulation that the money to pay for them be found elsewhere first. This is unfortunate.    The White House obviously feels it cannot lose by pushing the tax-cut extensions right before the political conventions. Either Mr. Bush will be able to brag about still more tax cuts, or he can demonize Democrats and others who dare to defeat the package on budgetary grounds. We urge the Republican moderates, including Olympia Snowe of Maine and Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode Island, not to abandon their fight for fiscal responsibility."

As Roger Ebert wrote, the plan is to 'use anticommunist hysteria as a cover for a communist takeover.'   The movie doesn't say what Iselin would have done if the plot had succeeded.

      Check out  urlLink this article  from the New York Times, which starts with the following quote:   "With tens of thousands of their citizen soldiers now deployed in Iraq, many of the nation's governors complained on Sunday to senior Pentagon officials that they were facing severe manpower shortages in guarding prisoners, fighting wildfires, preparing for hurricanes and floods and policing the streets."    There are two points to be made here:   1. in juxtaposition with our other posts below regarding wages, what we seem to have is high unemployment contributing to low wages in new job creation, yet we have a shortage of labor for crucial government services;  2. is the terrorist threat, the distraction we've been tempted into by Chalabi in attacking Iraq and the potential for problems in Iran a huge distraction to our security at home? are we about to get snuck?   I personally think that the answer to number 2 is NOT more war. It is constructive, inclusive, benevolent global citizenship. This is a long-run strategy. In the short run, I suppose there are reasons to be concerned.   But, what about the labor picture? (I'm not going to adderss the appropriateness of having lightly trained&nbsp;N.G. folks in Iraq....different question.)&nbsp; Seems to me that we DO have plenty of idle hands around (since wages are falling and people are working in no-skills jobs at WalMart) and that the training of these folks in the skills we need while the N.G. folks are in Iraq would be skills that would serve them well in future employment. They could also probably demand higher wages for these skills in re-employment after the war is over. AND, if in the short run there is a labor shortage for these jobs, let's take advantage of that and pay a decent wage to folks that are struggling to get by.   The New Deal was a fantastically successful attempt to leverage the State in the development of both skills, jobs and the infrastructure which has underpinned this country's dominance over the last 50 years. Why would we ignore this empirical evidence, particularly when the circumstances so strongly promote this strategy???   Call your governor. They clearly need some suggestions.

      This quote is beautiful....read the whole  urlLink article :  "Mr. Schwarzenegger has compared lawmakers to kindergartners who need a timeout and threatened to seek a constitutional amendment making the Legislature a part-time body. He is also appearing in the districts of vulnerable Democrats and promising to 'terminate' those who stand in his way." We had Jesse the Body here in Minnesota hoping to be reincarnated as a 38DD bra, or something close. He also reportedly gave out "Jackal" passes to the media at his annual fishing opener.   Obviously these statements and actions are amusing in a number of ways, but they just do too much damage to the quality of political discourse.   I DO think that Jesse did a good job at speaking directly and simply (but not a'la GWB; I do think he had an informed opinion) and demanding of the legislature to cease &amp; desist with the most eggregious of game-playing and partisanship. I think Ahh-nold's frustration is similar. But it is the pot calling the kettle black for a name-caller to liken the legislators to kindergardners. And, to threaten "termination" is very much playing the political game that Jesse at least seemed to try and avoid.&nbsp; Ahh-nold is undermining what&nbsp;little credibility he has.&nbsp;   In any event, what  we  need to do is continue to push information, find ways to access folks that have not participated in politics in the past, and do everything we can to make us all feel validated in our practice of democracy. Eventually we should demand dialogue at the high level to which we are entitled. But we have to start talking that way ourselves first.

      From the  urlLink New York Times :  "On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that hourly earnings of production workers - nonmanagement workers ranging from nurses and teachers to hamburger flippers and assembly-line workers - fell 1.1 percent in June, after accounting for inflation. The June drop, the steepest decline since the depths of recession in mid-1991, came after a 0.8 percent fall in real hourly earnings in May" This is particularly relevant to me with respect to work I'm doing on tax policy for a Minnesota think tank. Because our mission is to try and better marry the concepts of economic justice (read, people) and growth (read, business) (hence the name of the group  urlLink Growth &amp; Justice ) we are very interested in WHERE tax policy might best be adjusted, i.e. at the business level or at the individual level.   Much of the history of business incentives has seen tax breaks aimed at capital (mostly machines, real estate, and other business inputs EXCEPT labor). It can probably be shown that reducing the cost of business helps business create jobs...this has been the rationale for business tax cuts. It is notable, however (confirmed by this article), that business won't necessarily create GOOD jobs, or ones that pay a living wage (one that is sufficient, at minimum, to pay basic healthcare costs in addition to housing and food). WalMart is in the news recently for creating lots of really BAD jobs. Not only do they not pay a living wage, but to avoid requirements to pay healthcare as part of the employment package, WalMart hires people on a part-time basis.   There seems ample evidence that business will continue to act like business...maximizing the bottom line. (I'm not sure if I mean this in a factual way, or with a harsh judgement about business' failure to take up their share of the social contract that everyone should have a basic lifestyle, including healthcare....Paul Krugman, in an editorial I noted previously, exonerated business from any responsibility beyond making profits because, in his words, "they are business". An editorial letter writer objected to the idea that business should be so-relieved of its responsibility to this social issue)...but, I digress.   Whether you believe that business should take up part of this social contract or not, clearly today they are not incented to, either through law or social mandate. Couple this with the statements recently by Alan Greenspan which recognize, as does this article, that retail spending is the ONLY thing that is keeping this economy afloat right now and you are faced with a very obvious policy platform: business will not create jobs unless someone is there to buy their stuff; therefore, rather than making business rich by "reducing" their cost of business, put public tax incentives into the hands of consumers, and business will be along for the ride BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO....they make money.   On the ground, this smacks of liberal tax and spend mentality. BUT, even the conservatives will admit that consumer spending is driving the economy. I would argue strongly that conservative and liberal interests are actually aligned. Targeting tax relief and tax law changes to put more incremental dollars in the hands of average and low-income consumers will create the demand business needs to invest in new jobs and new capital.&nbsp; This sort of tax policy (reflecting a more generous social policy) IS consistent with business goals and, implicitly, with the long-term goals of those that own business, overwhelmingly conservative.&nbsp;   I would argue that the marginal propensity to spend, i.e. that portion of each additional dollar that gets spent rather than saved, is substantially higher among the middle and low-income population, because they MUST spend that money on necessities. Wealthy people put it in their savings account or stock portfolio and maybe, just maybe, a few years from now that better capitalized business MIGHT create a few more jobs which MIGHT pay a living wage.....it MIGHT.   If somebody is banging on their door, trying to purchase their "stuff", they WILL.....I guarantee it. That's what business does.

      Along the same lines as the post below, Joanathan Chait at TNR has an article  urlLink detailing at length  how the Bush Administration and the GOP in congress has gone about systematically undermining our democracy:    Bush and his allies have been described as partisan or bear-knuckled, but the problem is more fundamental than that. They have routinely violated norms of political conduct, smothered information necessary for informed public debate, and illegitimately exploited government power to perpetuate their rule. These habits are not just mean and nasty. They're undemocratic.    Read the entire article, it will scare you. Send it to anyone you know who may be on the fence. More evidence why this election could be the most important in out history. We stand at the precipice looking into the abyss of one-party rule, the first step on the slippery slope to fascism. This is one we cannot lose.

       From    Verified Voting - Campaign To Demand Verifiable Election Results   :     "'I clearly believe that there are certain people within the election process who don't want that scrutiny on how elections are run,' Heller said. 'Why elections directors so fight this process is just incredible to me.'" -- Nevada Secretary of State Dean Heller   The "scrutiny" is that which is necessary to prove what people's votes really were.&nbsp; Paper proof.&nbsp; (The manfacturers make cash machines for god's sake.)&nbsp; (Big T recognizes that proof doesn't seem to be required for this presidential administration to, say, go to war......nonetheless, we aim to promote a higher standard)   The counties fight new systems because of all of the friction, territorialism and bureaucratic red tape inevitably involved in change, particularly of public systems.&nbsp; But read the rest of the article....  &nbsp;  The real problem here is that&nbsp;this friction serves to enforce the status quo which in itself is costing us dearly in our practice of democracy. Add to that a deliberate program of confusion, contradiction, and rule ambiguity and you have the power of the Secretary of State to control the outcome of a close election.   Voter Registration, accurate records and access on the voting day are all necessary to have a fair election.   Registration forms must be integrated, information must be cross-checked for accuracy, voting machines must be installed, people must be trained, systems must be tested and their reliability absolutely confirmed before the system can be relied upon to measure the will of the people.  &nbsp;  Our current registration and vote tally system (VEMS), though imperfect, has a known tolerance for error.&nbsp; A new system won't. A new system could be tested against the current one, run side by side, both in full operation. Relying on a new system that is untested in  THIS  election is ludicrous.   We are up to this task, but the Secretary of State has made our job ever more challenging. In Minnesota we, like all other states, were given a few years to develop a totally reliable system. Our secretary of state along with about 8 others, waived most of that time, and intends to rely on a system that will be unproven in an actual election.   New metropolitan airport systems, for example,&nbsp;are tested and retested for years to work out the bugs. The Secretary's lieutenant described the process of developing a way to integrate the various data sources as their department's "summer project".&nbsp; Do we really think we can rely on an untested system in the most important election of a generation?   Do not be deceived. The status quo favors the group in power.&nbsp; Regardless of your feelings on that, democracy really demands full and encouraged access to the voting polls.   Voter participation is another matter&nbsp;altogether.

      I only have a minute this morning, but I have been making the case for the imminent power grab which the ideological right has an option make.  urlLink In this editorial from Paul Krugman  he makes the point well.  This is a must read if you have any doubts that the political playing field is far from fair.  The conclusion:  "Mr. DeLay and his fellow hard-liners, whose values are far from the American mainstream, have forged an immensely effective alliance with corporate interests. And they may be just one election away from achieving a long-term lock on power. "

      This quote from the  urlLink New York Times  is part of an article discussing the strategy of pre-emptive war as a core principle of our foreign policy:  "The Democratic Party platform is expected to include a sentence declaring that the 'doctrine of unilateral pre-emption has driven away our allies,' and Mr. Kerry argued in the interview that while he would reserve the right to act pre-emptively, he would never make it a core doctrine of American foreign policy."  So far, largely as a result of the intelligence failures now documented by the 911 Commission, the strategy of pre-emption has been a dismal failure.  Not only have we waged a pre-emptive war, costing thousands of lives; not only have we alienated our allies with our egotism; not only have we dramatically increased the appeal of terror as an acceptable retaliatory answer among disaffected muslims;....we have also given our global competitors, namely China, (not to mention actual enemies) all the traction they need to oppose us on issues like North Korea and Iran (points also made in this article).    On a non-military note, China already has substantial power over the U.S. in the form of its foreign exchange reserves held in dollars.  China represents an enormous challenge to us in global diplomacy and in international economic dynamics.  We are concerned about offshoring jobs, yet we are squandering any leverage we have with China through our foreign policy failures.    Certainly the nature of terror in today's world is different than conventional war.  The adequacy of our intelligence community needs to be addressed if we are to be successful against terror and rogue states, whether we adopt pre-emption as our primary policy or not.   BUT, particularly where we can't rely solely on our own intelligence community, we have to be able to rely on our global partners as we address international security together.    It goes even further...beyond the technical and logistical issues of intelligence cooperation we have said to the world (in no uncertain terms shortly after 9/11) that we know better (and clearly we do not); and, furthermore we will act on that supposed knowledge even if the consequence is high casualty numbers.   A pre-emptive strategy will promote a quick end to our global influence.  John Kerry appears to understand that we can't be alone in this regard and that our future as a global power depends it.  It's one of many reasons we should support him.

      Another post related to the perception that our electorate is either informed or involved.  I am not familiar with the credentials of Jack Germond, but found this quote in the  urlLink Star Tribune  (it was in the print edition):   "Today, after 50 years of exposure to thousands of politicians, I am convinced that we get about what we deserve at all levels of government, up to and including the White House.  These days, because so many Americans -- almost half -- don't bother to vote even in presidential elections, they deserve choices like the one they were offered in 2000, between Al Gore and George W. Bush.  Beause so few Americans understand the political process or bother to follow it with even a modicum of attention, we elect presidents as empty as George H.W. Bush or as self-absorbed as Bill Clinton -- only to be followed by a choice between a Republican obviously over his head and a Democrat too unsure of his own persona to be convincing."    Whom to blame for this?  Individuals for not realizing the power they truly hold, politicians for allowing our media culture to define politics in overly simplistic terms and the mainstream media for being interested only in sound bytes, controversy and skin.  Of course, the issue is far more complex than this. Institutional barriers to adequte information abound: poverty, multiple jobs and a mainstream media owned by the corporate (read conservative political) establishment, to name just a few.    I'd suggest that these three substantial institutional barriers are a direct result of neocon policies. The continued consolidation of power between the conservative political establishment and their media partners is having the insidious (and perhaps intended) effect of precluding the exercise and validity of citizen participation in our democracy; these barriers thoroughly disenfranchise an enormous portion of the American citizenry.  Sure, the neocons are part of representative government...but do they represent America?  Emphatically NO.

      Thanks to Chris Dykstra on his  urlLink blog  for reference to this article in  urlLink The New Republic   The article discusses the explicit pressure by the U.S. Administration on the Pakistani government to locate Osama bin Laden and other high level terrorist targets.  What it also clearly shows is that the interest in catching Osama bin Laden is NOT in the interests of protecting the American people, as Bush would have you believe; rather, the interest is in protecting this junta's political power.  One more successful election for this group and their consolidation of power will be almost complete.    Fair comparisons can now be made to other "dictators" who would do most anything to hold onto power, even things contrary to the interests and safety of their people.  We all hope these terrorists can be captured, and as quickly as possible.  Given the apparent motives of the administration, consider a case where the election was farther off; would the Administration delay aggressive tactics to capture these terrorists in order better to leverage the issue for their own political gain?   While our election should be on issues that affect us as Americans and issues that define us as global citizens, the  most important issue upon which we should vote this election is  TRUST  .  How much more evidence do we need that this Administration has no interests in common with the rest of the American people?    I've seen it on bumper-stickers:  regime change begins at home.

      This quote from the  urlLink Panetta Institute for Public Policy  illustrates a disturbing trend among the youth of our country:  "Both major-party presidential candidates have a lot of work to do on U.S. college campuses this year, according to a new Panetta Institute survey. The Hart Research Associates poll found a major decline in student's perceptions that voting really matters. The number of students who say they volunteer to help in their local communities is down also. "  If you scan the headlines of prior polls, a very fickle sense of our youth is revealed.  I certainly remember being very unsure of my convictions as I went through college, and many things seemed more important than political activism or community service.  I can not criticize young people for being unsure of their convictions to issues, but I am disheartened that their confidence in the system by which they express their views is deteriorating.   It is hard for me to avoid the conclusion that the waning interest of our youth, and the frequent sentiment among them that their vote does not matter, is a fuction of the irrelevancy of most mainstream political discourse.  Politicians of both parties are to be criticized in this regard, but the blame is not theirs alone.    I received a comment recently on a post involving war profiteering (see prior posts, right column) in which the commenter expressed the view that the American electorate is reasonably well informed.  What they are informed about is the agenda of the status quo, as repeated ad nauseum through the major media establishment.  I'd hardly call this informed on the true issues facing our nation.  Quite the contrary, our electorate is informed on intentionally divisive and distractionary issues with little or no true bearing on their daily lives.  Individuals have the responsibility to do their own investigation of a candidate's positions.  It is reasonable to expect to be able to rely on our "independent" media. It is the responsibility of the media, therefore, not to be a pawn of narrow interests. Here we find one significant failure of our current system.

      Bob Herbert has it right in his editorial today  urlLink in the New York Times :  "One of the more disturbing things about our presidential elections is the extent to which they can turn on criteria more suitable to high school campaigns. He's cute. Would you look at the way she dresses?"   I can't say this is new news; what I can say is that it is the arguement that makes it most difficult to conclude that we are not a nation of shallow, self-interested folks.  This may seem like a non-sequitor, but I have recently been to China, the presumptive next global economic powerhouse.  Admittedly I have a hard time imagining how they will be ready for "ling-ba", the 2008 olympics.  What I can tell you is that they are hungry.  We are fat and lazy and asleep.  This needs to be changed and hording capital among a very few elite is not the right approach.  As I saw it today on a bumper sticker: Regime change starts at home.

      Big T strongly believes that you should read this here entire  urlLink Paul Krugman editorial   concerning John Kerry's healthcare plan.  Here is one specific poing which I wholeheartedly agree with:  "the Kerry plan would provide 'reinsurance' for private health plans, picking up 75 percent of the medical bills exceeding $50,000 a year. Although catastrophic medical expenses strike only a tiny fraction of Americans each year, they account for a sizeable fraction of health care costs.  By relieving insurance companies and H.M.O.'s of this risk, the government would drive down premiums by 10 percent or more.   This is a truly good idea. Our society tries to protect its members from the consequences of random misfortune; that's why we aid the victims of hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorist attacks. Catastrophic health expenses, which can easily drive a family into bankruptcy, fall into the same category. Yet private insurers try hard, and often successfully, to avoid covering such expenses. (That's not a moral condemnation; they are, after all, in business.)"   I spent a dozen years in finance. Providing credit enhancement is a fantastic way of massively leveraging the credit strength of the federal government.  It is efficient and allows average people to pay health care premiums related to the average level of care that they demand.  This is smart stuff.    The best comment, though, is that, basically, business is business and can't be relied upon to do anything good for anyone else.  This we have to deal with.

      The quote below is from the New York Times, but courtesy of  urlLink Talking Points Memo :  "A bipartisan Senate report to be issued Friday that is highly critical of prewar intelligence on Iraq will sidestep the question of how the Bush administration used that information to make the case for war, Congressional officials said Wednesday. But Democrats are maneuvering to raise the issue in separate statements. Under a deal reached this year between Republicans and Democrats, the Bush administration's role will not be addressed until the Senate Intelligence Committee completes a further stage of its inquiry, but probably not until after the November election. As a result, said the officials, both Democratic and Republican, the committee's initial, unanimous report will focus solely on misjudgments by intelligence agencies, not the White House, in the assessments about Iraq, illicit weapons and Al Qaeda that the administration used as a rationale for the war."  Marshall's response was "Convenient...."   Mine is: "are you freaking KIDDING ME???  Seriously, while the candidates compare service records, capabilities, hair-styles, tendencies toward profanity and, occasionally, an issue or two we are forgetting a crucial shortcoming of the current administration:  TRUST.  Congress wouldn't pass Patrick Leahey's anti-war profiteering bill, and now they've effectively delayed release of the proof that they are all morons until after the election.  Talk to your friends.  We HAVE to mobilize people on election day.  Wouldn't you think that being lied to repeatedly would be enough?

      This quote is from  urlLink InJersey ; it is quite evidently a mouthpiece of the NJ right wing.  In this article about the state budget situation, even this rag has to acknowledge the standard strategy of the neocons:  "The Republicans summoned the press to announce a lawsuit over McGreevey's bonding to pay for operations, saying a budget balanced with borrowing is not a balanced budget. It went well until reporters asked Senate Minority leader Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, what Republicans would cut from the proposed budget. Unfortunately, Lance said that was the governor's job. No specific suggestions."  They called a press conference to bitch, and then offer NOTHING.......sound familiar?

      Statements by prospective attendees to the 2004 GOP Convention, taken from  urlLink this article in the New York Times  The comments are about the cost of the event which this year for the first time will be passed on to its attendees.  About the cost of the event:  "'A lot of us looked at that thing and said, whoa!''  "A lot of people just can't afford that.''  "We want to use our hard money resources in the smartest way possible,''  "The price of playing the game has risen dramatically,''  "I don't think anybody is happy about writing the check. But it's a cost of doing business.''   About the Bush Campaign:  "These are about the stingiest bunch of guys I've ever seen.''  "I don't blame them," ..... "They didn't have a choice. They are not trying to stick it to us, there are costs to these things."   Abouth ambitions:  "I really wanted to be a Pioneer or a Ranger; that's what I worked my butt off to do,'' ...... "I don't have an endless pot of money to commit to political events. But I didn't want to go there and not participate in the Pioneer and Ranger stuff. That felt horrible.''   Can you hear Will Farrell saying that last line?   urlLink Read the article, it's great.     The 35% of "republicans" that are living not  quite  as far over the median income line as they  think  are, are about to realize they're  getting screwed in this deal too. Then we will have common cause that they understand.

      In a follow up to the post below, Bob Herbert's  urlLink column  today points out that, to a certain extent, it is our laziness and desire to be told what we want to hear, instead of hard truths, that have driven politics to their current sorry state:   These are incredibly difficult issues and an honest search for solutions can only come from a sustained effort by the broadest array of America's brightest and wisest men and women. What the U.S. really needs is leadership that could marshal that effort.   Unfortunately, we've become a society addicted to the fantasy of a quick fix. We want our solutions encompassed in a sound bite. We want our leaders to manipulate reality to our liking.   [snip]   The voters may deserve better, but there's a real question about whether they want better. It may well be that candidates can't tell voters the truth and still win. If that's so, then democracy American-style may be a lot more dysfunctional than even the last four years has indicated.    Important thoughts to keep in mind as we search for ways to reclaim our democracy from the looming corporate oligarchy. However if you read Herbert's column in the actual print version of the NYT, read past the end of the column, below his email address, you see the following words:   William Safire is on vacation.   Music to my ears.
