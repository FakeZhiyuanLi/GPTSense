       While I was checking out the new [b] format, I found this in the FAQ...  "What is a blog?  A blog is a web page made up of usually short, frequently updated posts that are arranged chronologically — like a what's new page or a journal. The content and purposes of blogs varies greatly — from links and commentary about other web sites, to news about a company/person/idea, to diaries, photos, poetry, mini-essays, project updates, even fiction.  Blog posts are like instant messages to the web.  Many blogs are personal, "what's on my mind" type musings. Others are collaborative efforts based on a specific topic or area of mutual interest. Some blogs are for play. Some are for work. Some are both.  Blogs are also excellent team/department/company/family communication tools. They help small groups communicate in a way that is simpler and easier to follow than email or discussion forums. Use a private blog on an intranet to allow team members to post related links, files, quotes, or commentary. Set up a family blog where relatives can share personal news. A blog can help keep everyone in the loop, promote cohesiveness and group culture, and provide an informal "voice" of a project or department to outsiders."  So, after reading this I decided that TKMB needed a new challenge. Dumb links were fun, but there aren't many. Therfore, here is our NEW mission statement.   The Kevin McCurrach Blog: Investigative Reporting...Accept No Substitutes.   Our first story: Is this the real Andy Kaufman, alive and well? (see post below.)  Andy Kaufman, known for pulling such practical jokes like blurring television screens to make it seem like it is broken, may have pulled the biggest stunt of all time. According to his blog,   urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns   He is back and making a Wal-Mart/Starbucks tour across the USA. While not much proof has been given so far, I thought I'd see how all of this works out. AKR has more than 600 comments on each post, some claiming he is a phony, others singing his praise. So who is this person, really? Blogger, which is now part of the  urlLink Google  corporation, is the host of not only TKMB but AKR also. So, I have an idea. Why doesn't anyone contact Blogger, and see if they can track down who this imposter, or, absolute best pranker of all time, and put an end to the confusion?

       Have your own doubts, but it's rumored that Andy Kaufman is alive and well.      urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns: His Blog   I have my doubts, but if it is really him,    Welcome Back.  Here's the most proof he's given so far:              Well there's his proof so far...  But it is well known that Andy friend could play Clifton... we'll just have to wait and see.
