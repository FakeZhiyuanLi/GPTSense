      And I do. I kind of  almost  broke my brother's nose today, 'cos he knocked off my glasses on purpose. So I kind of slapped him, and his nose started to bleed. (Cool, huh?) Anyway, I gave him some tissue, but I could hardly care if his nose was broken or not. Turns out, it wasn't. I guess that's good, seeing as my mom would go berserk if his nose  was  broken. Ah well. I hate people like him. He's bloated and obese, and although he's 8 years old, he can't feed, bathe, put on shoes, change, or do anything himself! Oh god, I feel like pummeling him right now....

      Okay, ignore the stupid post below. I had my Chinese exam today. There was this comprehension passage, which set me thinking. It was pretty sad, really. It was about an old woman, and it was her birthday. But none of her children were there. They had work, studies, seeing a friend off.   They were good to their mother, of course. They gave her cakes, red packets, presents. But they WEREN'T there. She left the food, the presents alone, got up and looked out of the window.   She wished fervently that her children would come home, that it was a joke, that they would pop up and surprise her. She realizes that they won't discuss the day with her, they won't listen to her telling them stories. They won't sit with her, and they don't even speak Chinese anymore. They spoke English, and she couldn't understand them.  Then, she heard the doorbell ring. She opened the door, but it was not her children. It was what we call a  'karang guni'  man, a man who goes from door to door collecting newspapers and giving you money in return.  And it felt like a knife cut through her heart. She couldn't stop crying...  And it ended. I had difficulty not crying during the examination. I mean, it was really sad, and my eyes started watering. Luckily, I finished my examination paper in time, and I'm sick today, so I came home straightaway.  Then  I started sniffling.  It got me thinking about two things. The first, more important thing that us Chinese are taught is to be  filial . The second is that we have to keep our heritage. The Chinese are not as popular as Americans. 'We're Americans, we're so smart, we're so powerful, you Chinks suck, die Niggers, KKK rocks!' You ought to know what KKK means, I do, and I'm not supposed to learn about that at all. I'm from Singapore, you see.  Anyway, we ought to keep our heritage alive! If you're British, are you going to surrender to Americans, say 'soccer' instead of 'football'? If you're an American, sorry, I just hate you. If you're Japanese, Asian even, speak your own language! I'd speak Chinese, but my Chinese isn't very strong. (I'm a hypocrite. Deal with it.) But I'll learn to speak my language. I'm proud of the Chinese! Be proud of your heritage too! (Unless you're an American, 'cos Americans are way too arrogant.)

      I listen as I lie in my bed. I hear the harsh, quick taps of my siblings typing, almost as if in a frenzy. I hear my mother reprimanding them, unrelentingly. I listen to my own breathing. I think back to the last time I've had any fun. I think. I don't  mind  not having fun. As long as I have my dreams.
