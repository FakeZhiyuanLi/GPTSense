      Ok, Second entry in less than a week. Either I'm getting consistent or things are just getting unbearable. I think it's the latter, considering one of the girls I truly,  truly  hate just came up to me and told me that another girl I truly hate said not to date some guy I had  no  intention of dating in the first place. Stupid bitch... Now, I had thought this guy was cute but he's like two years younger than me, which destroys all my interest, because I'm not fond of younger guys. But I was stupid enough to tell my stupid guy friend, who doesn't know how to get his mouth shut, and, now, it's apparently gotten to bitch 1 and bitch 2. Lovely isn't it? I may just kill that guy after school for this... Idiot!  On top of all of this... I was completely ignored and excluded from from any conversation during lunch. It's kind of normal, but it really hurts when they do it, and it really smarted today, because I was stuck just sitting there shivering the whole time.  I'm really getting sick of people treating me like crap, and I'm no longer going to let them. Next person to do it will most defietly get chewed out, and I don't care if I lose them as a friend, because, if they treat me like this, there not my real friends anyway. I need people who I can trust and people who won't treat me like the scum beneath their boot.  Ok, I've ranted enough for now I suppose.   Love to all who care enough to read this.

      I'm really new at this... I write a lot of fiction stories, but I never could write a consistent journal before, so, please, bear with me as I struggle to do this....  A bit of background information maybe... I'm 16 years old in my junior year of high school, and I'm in the academic decathlon... Part of my problems... And in a bunch of advanced problems... Another part of my problems... I live in Arizona, and I love books, writing books, mythology and roleplaying, and swimming.  I really don't know what else to add for that so I'll just take things as they come. Now to talk about my problems, which everyone does in their journals.  I'll start with school. Like I said, I'm in Academic Decathlon, and it seems to sap away my life. I have ten subjects to study for, and I have my first scrimmage in three weeks. My teacher wants me to work really hard, so I can be on the team --he has an odd sense of faith in me-- and I don't want to let him down, but I'm starting to feel the strain of it all. I'm getting migraines again, and I'll have to give up all caffeine for the next month or so, since they help cause my headaches. I'm also in AP US History with possibly the coolest teacher ever. But Decathlon is causing my grades to slip in that class, and I really hate it. I can't afford to miss another assignment in that class for the rest of the semester. Then there are my trouble classes, which are math and English. Math is a given, I hate math, and I really suck at it, and it shows. However,  I should be doing great in English, but I hate my toad-like teacher and I hate the books and I hate the class all together, so I'm not doing well. Then there's Spanish, which is in a word easy. I have no trouble there.  School is only part of the issue though. There's of course the stupid guys in my life, who never cease to make me miserable. I have an ex-boyfriend, who is a freshman in college and is now going out with a freshman in high school, I think he does that to make me jealous, but it only makes me regret going out with him more. Then there's a guy in Chicago that I'm in love with and he, of course, isn't in love with me... Jackass... I'm trying to get over him, unsuccessfully. Then there's my friend from North Carolina, whom is only a friend to me, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't see it that way. Then there's a guy in my own school that I actually like, but he isn't interested.... Figures doesn't it?  Then there's the whole friends thing. I have five people I trust implicitly,a nd the rest are just crap that I hang out with. My best friend or now I guess exbestfriend has been lying and cheating and screwing me over since day one of our friendship, and she doesn't realize that I know, so she tries to bully me and make me feel bad when I lie to spare her feelings, which is complete crap! It drives me insane... I don't want to talk about the rest of my friend issues today...  Of course I have family issues. I have a sister who's a complete bitch, and a father who's a stupid ass who doesn't realize that we need a car to get around, so while he frolics around the country I can't even leave my house.  So yah... Life sucks doesn't it? But it's mine and I'll just live with it I suppose... Sorry for ranting, but no one want to listen to me,and I need someone to tell...

      "...Persuade them by giving them some of those little Goldfish crackers..."  I have a headache. Way too much caffeine for my system to handle, considering I can't really handle any at all. I just spent the last two days with two of my sister's friends, and though I tell everyone how much I hate it. I really love it. My sister's friends are really good people for the most part and they all like me, and we can all play games together whenever we want. I get the best of both worlds because, when I get tired of human interaction, I can go on my computer and they'll leave me alone until I want to come back. They don't expect anything of me except for some fun and help with video games. It's really much better than hanging out with people my own age, who expect things from you and you have to be careful about damn near everything.   So basically I enjoyed myself, though I'm left with a headache and now I'm feeling the absence of it all. I wish I had somewhere to go tonight, something to do, but no one really calls me outside of school. So I'm stuck here, writing in my journal, wishing it were warmer, or that I were somewhere warmer. But Hey, such is life.  I'll talk more later..  Faylinn

      "...And that wasn't the first time I stole a plastic baby Jesus from a lawn manger..."   consistency? What is that?   Ok, I've had a bit of a busy week. Last week was finals, I thank every god alive I only had to take four and only really needed to study for one. After that I had another review session and two parties. Both parties had bonfires and we burned decathlon workbooks. I got botany ones! In the words of the illiterate idiocies, score! I hate botany so much. Unfortunately, I forgot my workbooks both times so my personal foes still exist... Damn them! I also came home smelling like smoke from those parties and probably freaked out my mom. That's just a bonus though.  On Sunday, my friend and my sister spent  seven hours  watching the LOTR extended editions.... Never again. I was ready to kill someone at the end of it. I don't understand how those uber fans can stand seeing those movies over and over again. It's just over kill after awhile and it leaves me bored and violent. I can't wait to see Return of the King again though, but I maintain that I need to see it again to absorb it all. There was so much in it!  Anyway, the only other highlight to my week is my never ending war with my beads, which my sister had mixed up and I am eternally sorting them. Half way done though, so maybe the end is in sight...   Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, which means for the next couple days I'll be cut off from the social circuit, which sucks, because I don't celebrate the damn holiday. However... Day after tomorrow more ROTK goodness... Hehe... Yes, I am a sad person....  Write more later Faylinn

      "...And that wasn't the first time I stole a plastic baby Jesus from a lawn manger..."   I realized something today, something that I think I had known since the scrimmage, but I hadn't really realized it until today.  Before I get to that, I want to talk a little about my day though. I had two review sessions today, one for AP US History and one for Decathlon. History was first, and I got up at 8 for it. Went back to sleep and finally got ready at 9. I walked there and got there about five minutes before ten, when the session was supposed to start. Waited like forty minutes for my teacher to show up. He's never on time though, so it didn't really matter. We got some work done, and I got a cinnamon sugar bagel, which stuck to my hand, my teacher doesn't believe in plates or cups... It was yummy though.  At twelve my friend and I went to the Decathlon review session, and hilarity ensued as we ate sandwiches, goldfish, and Trader Joe's candy, which is so strong that it gave me a stomach ache after only four pieces. The friend, who was hosting the session, is rich. She lives in a gated community and her room is about the size of my apartment. She's so modest about it though, and she's really  really  nice. Someone I hope to become better friends with. She was the one who made me feel better after my god awful speech.  Anyway, after I was leaving, I realized that the Decathlon class had become more to me than a bunch of nerds I could talk to (band kids are  not  nerds by the way!), but they had become my family in a way. They're my closest friends and I feel most comfortable around them. I don't have to act stupidly around them or act like anything other than myself, and they accept me for it. More than I can say for some other friends of mine.  I love decathlon and at the moment it's all that's keeping me going. It takes all the energy from me, so I can't wallow in self pity, and I like that.  Anyway, I'll just keep trucking along,and I'll talk to you all later.  Faylinn

      "...And that wasn't the first time I stole a plastic baby Jesus from a lawn manger..."   I love that little snippet so much, and, in spirit of the holiday season, I decided to put it up and piss good Christians, which I am not, off. It's my goal of the day. Have I succeeded. Or do you have a sense of humor? Neh....  I'm feeling pretty good today, beside being treated like crap form my oldest friends, but, after awhile, you cease to care, or that's what I tell myself. I'm not sure if it's true, but I'll let you all know when I find out.   We had the most  boring  AP US History class today. It wasn't the teacher, he's never  ever  boring, but we've reached a pretty dull place in history I must say. Post reconstruction era is beyond dull, though at least I know what it is. My friend thought it was the 1930's.... Yah, I have smart friends don't I? They think they have the right to make fun of my decathlon greatness, but at least I know when the reconstruction was... Sheesh!  I didn't even tell them how I did, and they didn't bother to ask. Sounds like a well balanced relationship. He did get me a muffin though, so I don't hate him. However, I really don't understand why I mean so little to them while they tell me to my face that I'm their friend. A little honesty here! Ok, ranting is bad... Go back to happy place...  Yah, I have a Spanish presentation about Francisco Franco, and all I know about him was that he was a Spanish fascist that ruled Spain for such and such time. Shit...  Ok, on that bright note, I'm going to read... See ya!

      I had my first Academic Decathlon scrimmage this weekend. It was so stressful, but I don't think I've ever had so much fun before. I won three awards in my division, which is Varsity. I won a Third place In Science, Botany *cringe*, and two seconds in Music and Art. It was all very surprising. My coach was giving out the awards, and, when he announced the science award, he said, "She's going to faint." I very nearly did; I was so beyond stunned. I guess it just proved how low the scores were. I got a 500 out of a 1000 possible. Really low scores. I don't know how I did for music and art.   However, I know I personally sucked at speech, half my fault and half the fault of a bitch. You see, what happened is that I didn't have my speech as well memorized as I should've, so I stumbled a bit. My fault and I take full responsibility for my lack of responsibility. But the other part was that the timer didn't do her job. She was supposed to hold up the cards telling me how much time I had left, but she never did. She sat there trying to poke her eye out with a pen the whole time, an endeavor I wished she had succeeded in, and she didn't hold them up! So I was left there with a few sentences left in my speech, thinking I had gone horribly fast. So I started to stall. Then the damn buzzer went off! GAH!!! It makes me so angry. Then the bitch had the nerve to try and apologize to me, which I tried to accept politely, so that the judges wouldn't really kill me, but I might just kill her in Spanish class tomorrow. Other than that, my part in the scrimmage went off without a hitch. I'm angry at myself for not winning anything in Literature which is my strong suit, and I'll study the poetry better, because I know that was what got me.   Well after I died of shock. My friends and I went out bowling, which was just plain awesome. My first game rocked, my second sucked so badly that I rolled a gutter ball and it hit the pin collector thing. I had fun  though, so that's what counts.  Today has been boring with the exception of one thing. I had another political argument with a guy I happen to like. We always fight like this, and I happen to like it, despite the fact that he always wins, but that's not always what makes an argument great. In my opinion, a good argument is one which makes you think, and he always gives me that. So now I'm thinking about what he said, and he's starting to make me question my political standings. I don't like Bush, I never will, because I just can't respect a man that has no respect for me as an atheist. A Texan Christian is definitely not someone who loves all people no matter their religious creed, and his speeches, despite being written by someone else, clearly show his religious affiliation, and I hate hearing the religious undercurrent in every one of his speeches. It's really not right.  Bush's foreign policy was also one  of those things I never liked, but he's getting me thinking that, though I may dislike open war, maybe it was necessary for the people of Iraq. But then again, has this war made these people's lives any better? Are they really free now? I don't think  so, and maybe I'll talk about that to him later, most likely to be shot down, but I like the debate.   Ah well, that was my weekend, and I suppose I should talk more often... Anyway, back to thinking. Damn him, I was enjoying my brain being mush for today.

      "...Persuade them by giving them some of those little Goldfish crackers..."  Been a little while... I really loathe myself at the moment though.   I was always fascinated by masochism, even before I truly understood what it meant. I tried to understand why someone would enjoy feeling pain, and it was always described in books as a physical thing. Until I read the Kushiel books. In the second book Phedre talks about her fights with Jocelin and how she treasure every one with him, and that the pain of the body is nothing to that of the heart.   Emotional Masochism. It was then I began to understand my own fascination. I thought it was physical though and for the most part I ignored it. However, time progressed, and I found myself being yelled at by people who were special to my, and I found myself relishing every tear I shed over it and even forgiving them in a subconscious desire to shed more in that unbelievable pain that can only come from your heart bleeding.   This was nothing new. You can ask that boy I mentioned in my first entry, and he'd say that over two years, he'd broken my heart and crushed my spirit and infinite amount of times and every time I came crawling back to him.  I don't crawl anymore, and I thank whatever deity may be in existence for that bit of pride. But when someone hurts me, it makes me want them around more. I want to be hurt. I even talked about it a few times with people before this, but it all comes crashing down when he yells at me and calls me names, and I still forgive him, because I enjoy shedding tears.   Is it a weakness? Is it an advantage in that cruel world to want the pain that you're eventually going to get. I really don't know. I just hate myself for forgiving people who have hurt me in ways I can't begin to explain.  Hating life and enjoying my own self loathing. That's my fate...  Talk more later, Faylinn

      "One time I sent an e-mail to Peter Pan and Tinker Bell nearly kicked my ass!"  Can my life get any more screwed up?  Apparently it can, because at exactly 10:46 pm last night my phone rang, and when I saw the caller id my organs shifted. It's insane to think that of all people I had been expecting to call me so late it would be  him . Him being my ex-boyfriend. The ex-boyfriend that I had happily not had a decent conversation with since we broke up about nine months ago! What the fuck?!  I picked up the phone! I had to admit; I was curious. He had stopped calling me eight months ago, after I ignored his calls which were frequent, and not for the first time in my life, he answered in that tone of utter depression, defeat, and patheticness(for lack of a more descriptive word) in his voice. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Turns out, as I should've known and knew as soon as he asked if I was dressed, that he was on my doorstep. It's nearly eleven at night! I'm in my fucking bathrobe! I get dressed, against my better judgment, because I know he won't take no for an answer, and I go out there. The first thing he does is hug me and my face is against his neck and I can smell that scent of his that brings back every memory, every touch, and I nearly scream. I missed that scent. It was one of my favorite things about him. Fuck, fuck, fuck.    He refused to directly talk about what's bothering him, classic of him, purely him. I eventually figure it out. It's everything. Typical, I assure you, just typical, but we spent three  hours  talking. I was barefoot and shivering and he kept making advances, and I kept saying no. May I give myself that bit of pride. But I had to admit. I was weakening. I was actually glad when his little girlfriend called and I was put back in perspective. But God damn him! I'm thinking about him again! I don't want to be with him, but I want to be touched so badly last night. Oh fuck!  I dunno what else I can really say. I'm fucked. I know it  Be back later, Faylinn

      "One time I sent an e-mail to Peter Pan and Tinker Bell nearly kicked my ass!"  What constitutes knowing someone?  Is it knowing their favorite color, band or food in that random collection facts that now seems so middle school to me, but still seems important as though it's part of my childhood that I'm trying desperately to cling to as it's swept away?   Is it knowing how someone feels at every moment and about everything in that connection that only comes when people have known each other long enough and deep enough to know each other's darkest secrets and therefore their very souls?  Is knowing someone knowing when you're hurting them and feeling that pain rip through you, even though they've driven you to distraction, and you need the distance, but you can't bring yourself to completely sever that connection and there's always a link to that person, even though you half wish there weren't?  Is knowing someone the same as loving them? Is it like they're part of you no matter what happens and you can't help but feel incomplete when they're not around, even though you're angry at them and can't stand the thought of them?  Is knowing someone being angry at them and saying that you hate them when you don't hate them at all? Is it needing to find yourself in that deeper sense that the other person knows you in, and you can't even begin to understand?  Is knowing someone a mixture of all these things or is it none of the above? Is it something deep or that random collection of facts like knowing their birthday?  I don't know.

      "One time I sent an e-mail to Peter Pan and Tinker Bell nearly kicked my ass!"  My friend reminded me about this existing. So I changed the quote and now will babble uselessly for a few paragraphs.  Hmm... What's happened in the last month? Not much really. I got contacts and had a lonely boring Valentine's day. Didn't even have a babysitting job to take away the bite of being alone. Ah well.  I'm going up to phoenix this week with my dad and I'll be staying until Saturday. Acdec State competition. I really want to go to Nationals next year, so I have to work extra hard to be on the team  Next year's theme for Acdec is Ancient civilizations, or, at least, that's the rumor. I hope it's true because I love that topic, but that means a certain bitch will most definitely be in Acdec again next year. I may kill her.   But yah, that's basically what's happening. No great revelations about my life. I'll check in later. I added this thing to my toolbar, so I may update more often... Nah....  Faylinn

      "It is in Hell where you lord doth lie. Not thy lord of light, as thou had thought, but truely a lord of the dark. Whom else would condemn thee for the sins of thou own birth?"  By some absolute miracle I found the translated lyrics of Rise. I love it so much, because, like all the songs in Ghost in the shell, it's so powerful. I'm going to post the translation, because I doubt cyrcillic is of any use to you all.  I'm a soldier, and that means I'm both defendant and judge I am standing on the two ends of fire Bending over the steep turns, overtaking death and life I'm running to fight the shadow of the lies  No matter how much threads deceit weaves The truth will show the face of light  *Save your tears for the day when our pain is far behind on your feet come with me we are soldiers stand or die  Save your fears take your place save them for the judgement day fast and free follow me time to make the sacrifice we rise or fall  I'm a soldier, born to stand in this waking hell I am witnessing more than I can compute  pray myself we don't forget lies, betrayed and the oppressed please give me the strength to be the truth  people facing the fire together if we don't, we'll lose all we have found  *repeat  Chase the dream to the edge of the abyss This is the only way to save the world  Don't you cry, Hide your tears Because there'll be a new day Your fire Will be heating Thousands of hearts Now, rise up Hide your pain and fear far off  The one who is right will win Remember, everything is in your hands  *repeat

      "It is in Hell where you lord doth lie. Not thy lord of light, as thou had thought, but truely a lord of the dark. Whom else would condemn thee for the sins of thou own birth?"  Ok, life went down hill even further since my last confession. I failed at the one thing I'm considered good at. I went to a poetry reading, and, despite what my friends were saying, I didn't win a damn thing. I apparently suck at the only thing I'm good at. FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can't that damn god people put so much FUCKING faith in kill me now dammit!!!

      "I have never let my schooling interfere with my education."  School's out! Yesterday was the last day of school which was boring as all hell... the school part anyway, and today I made up the AP Test that I had missed a couple weeks ago. Technically I'm not allowed to talk about it, so I'll just say that I think it went okay. We can only wait and see though. Damn that.  What I really want to talk about was last night, which was the dreaded and long awaited "G" word. That word being graduation. It was good as far as most graduations go. Was smushed like a sardine behind people who smelled like alcohol, and  watched the class elected speaker, the salutatorian and the valedictorian give their speeches. I knew all three, so it was really a joy to watch. It was also easy to see the difference in level that the speakers were talking on. The elected speaker was speaking to her audience, and it showed in the memories she brought up and the laughs she worked for. The other two speeches were the more classic ones talking about the future, and they spoke on a higher level, which I appriciated. The Salutatorian's was especially good.  Then we watched some of our favorite teachers read off names, including my history teacher, who showed up wearing a fadora and looking the world like he didn't want to be there. It was classically him and my friends and I cheered him on just because it would piss him off. He's my second favorite teacher. My Acdec coach is my favorite teacher, and it as a riot to hear him purposely mess up the names of his former students on purpose, then listen to the people who didn't understand what was going on, and thought it was an accident. I was laughing rather hard.  I also ran into my ex boyfriend there... again. He was as twitchy as ever. WHen he has too much energy, which is all the time, he can't sit still and it amuses me to no end. Fortunately we only talked for a few minutes before the ceremony then I managed to avoid him.  After the ceremony, we all stormed the field and I hugged absolutely every senior I knew, including one of my closest friends. She tried to shrug it off in that nonchalant, I don't give a damn about the world way she has, but I know we're going to miss eachother a lot. I know I do already. She means a lot to me, despite our constant bickering, and as much as she fought it, she became a constat in my life, and the part of me that hates change will very much miss that.   The rest of me is happy for my friends, and so far, I haven't cried over it, which is a good sign. I just wish my fellow decathletes, and more importantly, my friends, the best of luck in their lives. May they prosper, may they never be forgotten, and most importantly, may they live.

      "If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it's yours. If it doesn't... Catch it, tie it up and play boy band songs to it until is has no more willpower of self confidence left."  Oh man. I'm so glad this week is finally over, and that I finally have a moment or two to breathe. For the past month or so, I've been arguing with a guy so much that I was stressed out of my mind, and he wouldn't leave me alone. He just kept attacking, trying to prove that he was the victim in all this, while he stabbed and twisted the knife. This post will undoubtedly cause more trouble between us when her reads it. Fuck that though. I'm so sick of it. Self centered bastard.  I need space! Thank any deity that he's leaving for camp and that I can have it for a few weeks. Maybe actually be able to talk to my friends with out him throwing a fit. Maybe be able to study acdec without him whining that I'm not paying enough attention to him. As though he's the center of my universe when he lives 3000 miles from me! If I had a boyfriend I swear he would explode.  Yah, ok, enough male bitching... I GOT THE SASSER VIRUS!!!! I got it Monday night! Called Dell three times that night, trying to get help. No use. They outsourced to India, so their service sucks ass. I can't believe how bad it was. I was hysterical by the end of the night. Above mentioned boy calling did not help matters.   Called my Dad the next morning. He made me do shit then restart me entire system. FROM SCRATCH! He yelled at me for whining too. I was so stressed out though! You would be hysterical too if this happened and no one was there to help you. I called dell again. Got more fucked up. My mom's new computer then came and I spent the rest of the day setting it up and making it work. It was relaxing to actually see things work.  My "love" came over on Wednesday, and it was a welcome distraction from the damn laptop, which I didn't bother with. The modem I could not get to work and I wasn't in the mood to get more Frustrated. We studied Acdec, and watched the Reduced Shakespeare Company: The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged. Funniest thing I think I have ever seen. Good stress relief.  Thursday I tried my hand at Dell one last time. COMPLETELY USELESS! Bitch would not let me send my Laptop in and then proceeded to make me do things I've already done, as though I'm some Neophyte, then download modem software from the other computer, use one of my CD's to burn it, and it didn't work! Called my Dad again and he hung up on me because I was practically in hysterics. It was a hard week! Jesus fucking Christ! That man is an asshole. I go to take a shower before I kill something and my mom then yells at him, telling him how hard this week has been for me. So he calls back and tells me to buy a modem card, which he'll pay for. FINALLY! Something! Then I have to deal with my Mom screaming at me because of the dishes... As though I wasn't stressed out enough with out the fucking temper tantrums.  Friday: Set up psycho bitch Grandma computer and listened to rampid Spanish. It's fun to listen to people when they think you don't understand them. Heh... Then we went to CompUSA and Best Buy and tried to get the fucking modem card, despite my dad being the most useless limp dick in the world, accusing the poor help guy of being incompetent when he was the only one who was helping me! He said if the sales guy was wrong he'd come out himself and tear out his nuts through his throat. Told him that it'd be amazing that he'd come out at all. Got hung up again. Went home, took forever to get damn modem to work. It throws tantrums too. I eventually got it to work though. I was then left alone. Started cleaning... Best thing for my frayed nerves. I called a friend, and she came and kept me company. It's fun cleaning with friends. Then we went out and got food. More fun, going down dark overton at high speeds.... eep... But we lived.   Over all it's been the week from hell. At least tomorrow the comcast guy comes and makes the internet fast. Also I'm just glad the week is over tomorrow. Maybe next week will be less stressful.  Faylinn out.

      "God said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.'"--Genesis 2:18  Weird for me to quote the bible. Really weird actually, but for now it seems to fit. Funny I would write one of my more... I guess you could say depressing entries so soon after my great achievement of peak pinnacle happiness. What goes up must go down.   Now, to actually explain my quote. It isn't good for man to be alone. The scribe who wrote that was very correct. It isn't. It's not good for woman to be alone either. I've been alone for over a year now, and when I had a taste of what I had been missing, it only made the pain of loneliness more acute.  It was truly my own fault. The fact that I thought I was different from other girls and could handle casual contact. I couldn't. I got caught up in the moment, and I became stupid.  I doubt it'll happen again.

      "If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it's yours. If it doesn't... Catch it, tie it up and play boy band songs to it until is has no more willpower of self confidence left."   I'm too lazy to change my quote right now. It's two in the morning and I haven't slept in about thirty-nine or so hours now. Hmm... I don't want to sleep. Right now, I'm so afraid that all of this is one big dream and I'm going to wake up and go back to that harsh existence I call reality. This euphoria is much more preferable.  I suppose, as usual, I should explain myself. Well, I'll tell the tale of the past two days. Yah... It's really two, and I'm really tired, but I want to write this all down, perhaps to prove it all genuine.  I spent the fourth of July with a friend of mine. It was a fun movie filled event, three of which I had seen, but I saw  The Girl with a Pearl Earring.  It was beautiful. It really was. I need to read the book before my sister hits me upside the head with it though. She can be really evil sometimes. Anyway, no great fireworks to report. I think they're getting skimpy. Though I did see a rogue firework. Bad news in this drought. I hope it didn't burn anything down. I stayed up til ten in the morning.   We ran to Walgreen at two and got soda and believe it or not condoms. She got them, the were her choice after all, but I managed to get one and it's in my drawer. I thought it was amusing. It was basically a girl's all out fun fest. My friend and I talked and I told her things that I never told some of my other friends, and I felt better for saying it.  After I went home, it would have been logical to sleep. I had a friend coming after all, and I looked a bloody mess. Logic, is not my strong point. Probably why I suck at math so badly. Therefore. I went into my mom's room and noticed I had a package for men from Hong Kong. I spent several minutes staring at it. Who the hell did I know from Hong Kong? I called my mom about it just as it occurred to me. I know who sent this to me. Turns out it was a Pucca and Garu doll from the guy I've been arguing with. It was scarce minutes after that when I got his phone call.  I specifically told him not to call.  As though I'm listened to anyway. Do no call seem to mean, except when I'm depressed... A twenty-four seven condition. He was having issues here, and, for his privacy, I won't get into them. Besides. It's a small bad part of a good day. Plain and simple.  The guy I was waiting to call was an hour late in calling. He had slept in... Lucky... After like an hour of getting things together, we actually managed to get him here. It was a miracle. I saw him for a scant amount of time once a year ago, and I otherwise had had no contact with him. I was so happy. Happier than I had been in a while. Especially after week of hell.  I'm still struck, even now by how tall he is. He used to be shorter than me, back in like middle school, but he's at least a head taller than me now, something he rubbed in a few times. His voice had also changed, deeper and something I was unaccustomed to, but I liked it anyway. It suited him.   We talked for a few hours in my room after that. A lot of it catching up, a lot of it joke telling. I had forgotten how much he used to make me laugh. He's also gotten a lot of stronger than me, not that it's difficult. I'm not at all known for muscle, but it was fun trying to pretend I did. It reminded me of old times. He was, after all, one of the best things about middle school.  Neh, he's gonna be reading this... Fuck, I hate this ego thing...  Ok, then we went out to the living room and we ended up watching a reality show my family's fond of, and we started cuddling on the couch. At first, I thought little of it. Not the first time, not the last. Then his fingers started stroking my upper arm. His other hand was touching min, running up and down my other arm. I lost all interest in the show then. I watched his fingers trail over my skin with fascinated eyes. I didn't dare mention it. I was so afraid of breaking the moment. Afraid he'd realize what he was doing and stop. So I happily played along with the game, my fingers playing with his as I buried my head in his shoulder.  I'm telling it like an author... It's nearly three now, so... neh...  This continued for sometime, and I sat there, completely petrified of ruining it. The damn Fae who run my blog know I haven't had a boyfriend in ages. Forgot what it was like. I relearned very quickly when we started kissing.  I was positive that the line between dream and reality had faded into nothing, or that I had fallen asleep and I was dreaming the feel of lips on mine. I even told him so, and he assured me of the reality... As though there's anyway to assure half dead psycho of reality. I'm still not sure it's all real. Not sure if it even happened. Not sure if all the wonderful things that happened afterward were all dreams.  There's only one thing that I'm sure was real. That was the water. We walked down to a pool. I say "a" pool because my complex has about six. He got us both wet while we were wading in the water, and I dream about water so often that the reality of the water struck me. I could feel water. It was cold and it was wet, and this was real.   It's a completely amazing though, and I know that this euphoria won't last, but for now I want to enjoy it.  I want to hope I see him again.  Faylinn out.
