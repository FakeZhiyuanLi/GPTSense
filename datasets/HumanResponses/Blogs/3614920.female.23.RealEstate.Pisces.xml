      This post is inspired by two things. Mackiebaby's post on fatherhood to commemorate Fathers' Day and a friend I would call here Mr M.  Mr M is a nice, handsome, tall,lean, charming and charismatic man. It is really fun, always, being with him. He is always sharing life experiences and inspirations, relating amusing anecdotes, not unlike Mackie baby. Being quite well-to-do financially, pleasant looking and in a job that he loves, with a sweet wife and wonderful toddler boy, you would think that he has it all, the lucky man. He always appears jovial when we go out, an optimistic,cheerful and easy-going fellow you would surely think.  But I think he must be one of the most miserable person I had ever lent a listening ear to. By choice and consequence? I am no saint so I make it a rule never to judge anyone. You can read on and decide for yourself...  A marriage with communication problems is what he told me.   A man that drifted astray and started to live apart from his wife and son.   A man whom had made himself a lonely man by choice seeking love in seemingly greener pastures.  A man that got entangled in far more complicated affairs of the heart and could not live without the love of a certain.  A man whom lives in the misery, confusion, doubts and insecurities of a young man's puppy love problems?  Are our lives and problems by our own choice?  The decisions we make and the routes we decide to take?  It is so easy to feel sad and going way out to sympatise (I wonder if that is quite the right expression...) with someone like Mr M and Alice in Wonderland. Deep down in my heart, I know that they probably are in the state they are today by choice. But I only want to listen and try to make them feel better even if the only thing I could do is to listen, empathise and wipe their tears away.  I am only really really sad because innocent people are hurt real bad in this silly experiment of love. When you have to build your happiness and trample all your loved ones in order to do so, would you really be happy even if you've got what you were after? Would you regret killing all your loved ones for this, in the years to come?  Would you take your regrets to your grave?  Why shoot in when you can't be a good daddy?

      Now.. I may know more screwed up girls than guys. But I have a close guy friend that screwed up so bad, he is writing me snail mail from the new Changi Prison quarters now. I got to know him as a senior supervisor when I was working in Meyson Jewellery 5 years ago when I was 18 years old.   I was a timid little girl with little job experience. He was very kind to me, always there to guild me, to motivate and give encouragement when I was down and out, when I was about to give up. It was a purely platonic relationship and he was like the older brother I'd always wished for.  I remember really respecting him as he was just a few years older than me, but the sole breadwinner for his entire family of 6. He had 4 very young siblings, a old grandfather, an unemployed mother and a father that ran away to Cambodia and never came back. Every month when we get our pay of a meagre $1k+, he would immediately transfer 90% to his mother's bank account and perhaps a mere $200 for himself, food transport and all.  This blog is entitled "Screwed Up". So obviously I am not here to commemorate him.   One day he was just dumb enough to become guarantor for a Malaysian close friend. Naturally his Malaysian friend ran away, back to Malaysia, leaving him to support debts from four groups of loansharks. (I would run away too, dumbo..)  Frankly speaking, when he first told me this story, it was so incredible I din know whether to believe him or not. No, he's not the deceitful sort. But perhaps I just couldn't believe he was so stupid.   There after, he started to borrow money. Thing is, he wasn't the borrowing sort. He refused to borrow from me in the past even when I offered to lend him to tide over urgent matters that came up.  Of course, no one could nor would ever lend him enough to repay his massive and rapidly snowballing debts.  It wasn't long before he turned to drug smuggling to pay off his debts.  It wasn't long before he became a drug addict himself to numb himself and forget the pathetic state he's in.  He was half conscious all the time.  Very loud, very vulgar.  He was a changed person when I met him again.  Totally unlike the sensitive,  thoughtful  thinking  self-motivated  sensible  articulate  witty  optimistic  the guy I respected and looked up to.  Oh.. the wonders of drugs and the things they can do to you.  He lost his girlfriend of 5 years, a wonderful girl totally devoted to him. (still regretting it to this very day when he writes me snail mail from prison.)  He lost his younger brother. (whom helped him to smuggle drugs to pay off his debts, took on the rap from the beginning hoping to get his older brother off the hook.)  Now doing time inside, my heart aches for him everytime I receive letters from the old Edwin I knew.   The optimistic Edwin joking about high security prisons allowing mosquitoes to fly in.   The sensible Edwin asking me to help look after his two younger siblings in secondary and primary school.   He asks us not to worry as he is working inside now and he gets a coca cola and curry bun for every night shift laundry he takes on.   He sends me a greeting card for festivals he bought with his meagre salary inside.   He misses our KTV sessions and pleads me to write song lyrics for him to remenisce.   He breaks down in his letters, regretting driving his wonderful girlfriend away.  He tells me no point crying over split milk and when he comes out, still can make it good.  But I really wonder, can you really start afresh after you lost so much?  Would it ever be the same again?

      I think the first I would love to comment on is this girl call Vivien.  It's not like all my friends are screwed up, it's just that I happen to know alot of screwed up friends. Now that makes a whole world of difference right? :)  Vivien is a beautiful and sweet looking girl, a couple of years my junior. Long flowing tresses with a sweet melting smile that would surely captivate the hearts of most men. I would say that I really envy her for having it all in life sometimes, being pretty, coming from a well-to-do family and a bright future ahead.  Only catch is, she doesn't realise nor appreciate it.  Indulging in messy relationships one after another, she bungles up the most sinciere boyfriends with her lies, deceit and inconsistency. Whenever she is short of cash, she fakes pregnancy to extort abortion fees. Really have to salute her for her business acumen sometimes.  She loves slow men and fast cars. Slow men are easier to trick. Fast cars can drive her around.  She enjoys mulling over her problems. She would be really bored if there was no trouble in her life. It's like permanently being stuck in a tragic drama series with it's roller coaster plot, twist and turn.. twist and turn.. and the sad leading actress leading a tragic dramatic life. She just can't stand living a normal routine life.  Nice and sinciere men avoid her like plague.  Nasty scheming men just takes advantage of her.  Actually, like most people with their good and bad sides, she's really quite nice.  If one day she could just see light and stop all her nonsense, she would be the happiest girl in the world. Then, I would really envy her. :)

      I'm not really good at expressing myself, but as mackie baby would say, I am just one big screwed up kid. Filing for divorce at the age of 18 just 3 months after marriage, there is just so much more that is too long to be posted on the net.  But after all these years of abuse, screw ups, trauma and what not, I still believe in the bright sides of life. Perhaps God has been fair to me, giving me as many open windows to match the number of slammed doors I meet. But I am still relatively happy the way I am now. Of course, many a times I wish I am as happy, as happy go lucky or as divorce-free as my peers. But still as screwed up as I am now, I am comfortable. There are many happy times ahead, no matter how hard it seems, just to keep going now. Mackie would say, that every sailor knows the moment before the break of dawn is the darkest hour.. :)
