      Friend is a four letter word.  I'm not exactly sure what that means...There is so much that it can mean. Is it "Love", is it "Hate", or anything that falls between? Sorry, once again music has a large indentation on my blog... shit happens.  Well, i just finished watching the Matrix, which is interesting, because now i'm in one of the cynical, "why?" moods.  I know, thats soo amazingly dorky, and kinda stonerish.... but what can ya do? can't control feelings can ya?  But don't you wish you could?  Things would be soo much easier, and so much more... useless, that it would just be great! ::Sarcasim::   Well, I'm kind of lost for words, because i'm not in any specific mood. I don't have any problems, and aggitation, and frustration, and vice versa, i'm not happy, not excited, i'm just... There.     Well... Closing quote...hm...     "In this of cards, We're all holding hearts and spades... You think with your eyes and you give it away.."

      This not sleeping stuff sucks. I'm here,all alone in my house, with nothing to do, nowhere to go, and nobody to see. This is lame. Besides the fact that i kinda just found some troubling news, but that isn't all that bad. The past is the past. Anyway, when I'm awake at night, with nothing to do, just lying around motionless, thats where I think. I think about everything, and everything becomes soo much more transparent and less obscure. Why am I too nice to people? Why do I care what other people feel about me? This is where I just sigh and stare at things other then a mirror, I dislike my image.   "Look at the stars, Look how they shine for you, And everything,  That you do.. Yea,  They were all yellow, I came along,  I wrote a song for you, And all the things you do, And it was called "Yellow", Then I took my time, Oh what a thing to have done, And it was all yellow.."  "Oh, you know I love you so..."  Heh, sorry, song lyric had to jump in my head...A.D.D. attack... DEhh!  Anyway, I love music.  I just clears everything that you feel, and you imagin the song, and how the lyrics mirror images into your eyes, that are actually flipped upside down in your cornea. After the words mirror pictures into your cornea, they reach your brain, through such tiny wires and twist-e ties, called nerves. Then it reaches your cerebellum, where the images are flipped upside down, making them the right way, and then everything is clear again. I love how music always seems to reflect on me. In almost anything i've ever heard, there has been atleast one lyric that i can say i relate to. Amazing, isn't it?  Well, probably not to most people, but to me, i'm there. How everytime you hear a song, and pay attention to it, you can almost picture a music video running through your head. Or atleast imagin what the video would be like.   Ok, weird, why am i talking like that? Well, i hope my viewers find it interesting.  Well, anyway, why do i over-analyze everything.  I make everything so amazingly difficult, while i have everything i need to make the right choice at my fingertips.  Fuck. Opps, bad word.  Hmm... Fuck.. is that a complete sentence? Hmm.. theres a subject and predicate.. but... is there?  What does the term "fuck" mean, i mean, its a verb, noun, adjective, and all that great stuff. Hmm... well, i guess its a sentance, i know "Go." is the shortest complete sentance, but Fuck is close.  Too bad fuck isn't in the dictionary, its be such a long deffinition.    See what insomnia does to me? agh!   Oh shit, I told Liz I'd call her today. Eep! oh well, I'll call her tomarrow. And i know shes going to read this and be like... "Moran.." but i guess it all works out.  Oh well,  "I'm tired, I think i'm going to try the sleep thing again"          - Little Nicky

      Well, here i am, the 2nd time today, but the first time doens't count because it was dedicated.. :)  Anyway, i don't know, i'm starting to listen to some of the enuendo the musc i'm listening to is putting out. its kinda weird, almost like sublimal messagess. oh well, i'm weird, don't bother, its 2:30 a.m. and i'm fucking beat, i'm going to bed..

      Well, here i am, writing to you again. I guess it's just something that i like to do.  Liz, you are the rock upon which i stand.  I don't know what i would do without you, as typical and as cliche as it sounds, its the absolute truth.  I mean, i can easily count that 20 times in your yearbook, and i'm sure everyone meant it, which i guess doesn't make me an odd case.  You've changed me more then anyone i know, you have more of an impact then i have on myself.  Which is kinda sad on my part, but it is the truth.  Your one of the only people who've had faith in me, especially when i didn't.  Just being in your presance gives me hope. And i look at everyone, and how you've helped everyone else, so does that make you a saint? should.   You're the best person i've ever met, and probably ever will meet, and i'm so amazingly thankful that i've found that one person in the first 15 years of my life that people don't find in their whole life time.  You've been there since the beginning, and i hope you'll be there to the end.  I know i'll be there for you, because i'm in such debt to you for all the pysciatric help you've giving me. Shit... Green eyes.  If i had the chance to change anything that has ever happened with us, i wouldn't change a single thing.  And what really suprises me, is that you still have any respect for me what-so ever for all the shit i've pulled.  I wish none of that had to happen, and i'm so happy that regardless of the situation, you were there to help me.    "I love you Liz", once again, amazingly cliche.  I can't wait to spend another school year with you, but when that is over, i know i'll be in shock, and probably wish i could live it all over again. People say this is the best time of our lives, so how much worse can i get? Heh. We'll have to see, because you know that I'll always want to talk to you and that i'll always want to be with you.  And i know the way you talk about Andrew and all that, that i hope you don't read this to him, and say almost the same things that you just said to me in the truck.  Which i'm sure that won't happen, just a little comic relief. Sorry that i have to type this rather then to write it in your yearbook, but i can't wait until monday to do this for some reason, i just have the impecable urge to write this now. But hey, if you want me to, i'll write this word for word in your yearbook. All i know that is you make me the happiest person on earth.. cliche.  Liz, i'll talk to you after you read this i'm sure. :)

      Man, isn't this just great?  I get to hurt people, make other people happy, all while putting up a ridiculous front to make it seem like I'm enjoying it all.  Woo..  And from what i hear, thats not healthy.  It kinda shows, SAturday, I passed out and woke up with a nosebleed, I thought i OD'd on something I've never taken before, then i found out stress can do that to you.  Thank God to those people who make me happy, the remote few, and thank god for chocolate milk.. (had 4 of those today.)  Thats probably not healthy, but hey, i need calcium.  Anyway, here I am, all fucking night, just sittin here thinking to myself, recollecting on everything that happened these last few days.  Maybe i am wrong, but something gives me the feeling that i'm right.. hm..We'll see..

      Well, these last couple days have been, well, summerish. I mean, thats good, i found out i passed my chem regents! woo! And i've chilled with all the right people :) . Well, there really isn't all that much to talk about, because well, nothing went wrong in last few days. So I'll keep it short and simple.  "Do you realize,        That happiness makes you cry?"

Well, atleast bored isn't bad, right?  well, i guess i can conclude this super stupid post and try and find some new music. I'll update whomever is necessary.

      Wow, I really can't stop smiling after something i just read. Heh.. Well, there isn't much to say. Wow. For once in my life, i'm speachless...  Here, heres a lyrics... that relates to nothing.  There's a destination a little up the road From the habitations and the towns we know A place we saw the lights turn low The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow  Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts Two turntables and a microphone Bottles and cans just clap your hands just clap your hands  Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at! [robot vocal effect] I got two turntables and a microphone  (take me home with my elevator bones!) (that was a good drum break)  Pick yourself up off the side of the road With your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones Members only hyponotizers Move through the room like ambulance drivers Shine your shoes with your microphone blues Hirsutes with your parachute fruits Passing the dutchie from coast to coast Like my man Gary Wilson rocks the most  Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone  (Man [spoken]: "What about those who swing both ways? AC-DC's?)  Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone Two turntables and a microphone  Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone  Oh, dear me. Make-out City's a two-horse town (girl [spoken]: "That's beautiful, Dad.")  (Got my microphone....) There's a destination a little up the road From the habitations and the towns we know A place we saw the lights turn low The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow  Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts Two turntables and a microphone Bottles and cans and just clap your hands  And just clap your hands  Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone Where it's at! I got two turntables and a microphone  I got plastic on my mind (make it out, baby) yeah, yeah, yeah let's make it out, baby yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (scream) telephone plastic baby ahh, so good oh, yeah let's play good  ow ow ow ow ow   Just remember how big i'm smiling...

      Today..   well, what is there to say... It was just a good day for me. I mean, nothing went wrong, and everything went right. Tonite, me and Liz talked for about an hour and ½ which really did make my nite. Maybe even my week. Even though I think i screwed up a smidgen.. I braught up the point, "Maybe we are too perfect for eachother?" Which kinda shot me right through my heart. What i really meant was, you know, that we are just too good. We are. We're amazing, we amaze each other, and even ourselves.  I just kind of added the word, "eachother".  Then, I read her journal, and I guess I heard something that I've always wanted to hear.  I guess maybe that we're so perfect for eachother, that maybe we should be togethor in a sense. I think thats what she said.. but who knows for sure.  I can only hope.. right?  Oh I'm crazy about this girl...

      Well,       I came through. Everything happened just as i pictured it. I went to prom, didn't drink, nor smoke, nor do anything that would alter my actions. I went camping, didn't drink, didn't smoke, and i didn't do anything to shame myself! woo i'm a champ.       I'm kind of dissappointed though.  The senior prom was NOTHING compared to the junior prom.  The junior prom was so much more fun. Maybe it was the people, maybe it was my date :), maybe it was my tux, but... excuses excuses, the senior ball sucked.  Hmm... Well, Masa was entertaining at least... lol.  Oh well, i have some things to do, i'll post later if i get bored.   Ending quote...  "If you slit my throat,    With my one last gasping breath I'd       Apologize,          For bleeding on your shirt."

      Well,   As this year rolls on, it makes me think about next year, and how different things are going to be. I'm going to be the adult, one of the oldest kids in our school. But should i be? Probably, I was more mature then some of these people when i was 9. And what about the people who are leaving? I mean, don't get me wrong, ir eally don't like this senior class. There is a select few i will miss, and some i'll be glad to see go. But wow, i'm a senior next year? holy shit. School does go by fast. I know when people say that, i just smirk and go "yea right..."  Well, It would be odd, but next topic.  "Have you ever woke up and wished that you looked like something else?"  Yea, i have, i deffinitly have. I mean, i know this is kinda irrelevent, but my whole body is out of proportion.  My torso, and my chest are one flat line, no real muscle deffinition, like any guy would want.  Then, i have these huge legs... with a fat ass, some medium sized arms, and a huge head.  Yea, i wish i looked like someone else. Ultimatlly I'd like to look like a celebrity. But who wouldn't? Well, thats enough, i need something better to do then to sit here and do nothing. Bye..

      Man, there really is nothing to do anymore. "Lets go to the mall..", "I don't know...", "Wait, Let's go to the mall.."  Wow... cool huh? Dang ol'..  Oh well, Atleast baseball comes to the rescue... Heh.   This summer has sucked soo far. I'm not doing any of the things that I said I was going to do.&nbsp; It's so amazingly boring... I mean, There's got to be something to do in this wonderful city of Syracuse. Another thing... I'm not even seeing any of the people that said they wanted to hang out all summer... BAhh.. this is stupid.. nobody reads this shit anyway....

      I don't know, I mean,&nbsp; I'm in a good mood, but I just feel like screaming and running around. Too bad my jaw hurts... :( OH well, Another wonderful weekend. Pfft.&nbsp; Well, I really don't know what else to write in here, because I haven't done anything in a while... Hmm... Well, I do know that I am going to Florida in December, for my birthday. Cocoa Beach! Here I Come! Right.. finally, a place to leave my albinoness. I guess my mom wants to take a 3 day cruise... That'd be weird with your mom, but I'll hip, I'm done... woo wooo! And for some reason or another, I've been really artsy latley... Which is weird, because I really do lack artistic ability, i just think like a artist... which is also weird... Hmm...Heh.. Well, There really isn't that much else I can say, I've elaborated enough on that as I can.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   But i did see Mike Moore's movie...  &nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed. It's kind of hard to come out liking Bush in anyway after seeing that movie. But I'm going to like Bush just because it's trendy to hate him... Stupid fucking hippies...
