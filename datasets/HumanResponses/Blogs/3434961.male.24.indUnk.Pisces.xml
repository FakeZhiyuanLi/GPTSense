      Ah,yes.  Well I for one feel much better about my blog.  I spent some time crawling around other peoples blogs and ya know something?  People are boring!  So why should I feel bad for being boring... I am only human right?  Well if anyone every reads this, I'm telling you.. you gotta read Walden.  It is so delicious.  I've worn the pages of that book out in the last 5 years, but I can still crack it open and sink right in.  I know some people who don't read.  I mean, like ever.  Never one book all the way through.  It makes me what to scream at em'.  Well what's it to me anyway.  I've got this friend Stacy, and she is the coolest girl ever.  She was the first girl I was friends with in a platonic way.  I was driving a truck over the road and lost touch a bit, but she called me today and I forgot how much I really miss her.  She has a serious boyfriend now and that could suck, but he is totally cool too.  His name is Andy and he is way cooler than most anyone I know.  Together they are some super couple of coolness.  Well.... ah.. yeah.. cool

      Good morning my happy little blog.  Today is a day of triumph!  Having been unemployed for two weeks this very day the growing frustration with my goal of getting out of the rent trap and buying a few acres to spread out on getting further away instead of nearer has forced me in to a frightful position.... I am updating my resume.  Yes, folks time to get a job.  Now I have mentioned my lack of marketable skills.  I am a college drop out with experience in retail, restaurants (cook), general construction labor, and driving big trucks.  Ah, how I hate all my previous jobs.  A necessary evil I suppose.  Well, in other news I have decided that perhaps the meaning to this game show of life is to attain perfection.  I mean to do each and every act through  out your day to the best of your ability, the best you can.  To care with your whole heart about what you do, and to not do what you do not care about.  Caring is key.  The thing is I am no perfectionist and am constantly doing things I care very little for.  Ah well, maybe I'll just go back to bed... I care about that.  You know I haven't really wrote anything except for my dream log in years.  There's been no letters, for at least a year, no poems in perhaps 2, no story's in maybe 4.  Not that I have other been a prolific writer or have any hopes at being a published work or something, but it seems important to keep on writing for some reason.  Doesn't it?  Well, now I got this blogg I guess.  An online journal that people can read and comment on.  You know that's kinda weird, but the anonymity makes it OK.  WHO ARE YOU!  Heh heh.  Well, I guess once I break the crust loose this all won't feel so forced.  Well, I have made of list of things to accomplish today ( besides updating my crappy resume )so onward I go into the loving embrace of responsibility.... ah so warm and tingley

      Lets, see where to begin.  Ah, yes at the beginning, I am a 24 year old, un (and frequently under) employed male with few marketable skills.  I enjoy old classy cars, old rusted jeeps, music, art, organic gardening/homesteaders, building with wood and stone, philosophy, cartoons and long pillow fights on the beach.  I am a confirmed book worm brainiac resulting in few meaningfully relationships.  I type slowly, mis-spell words frequently and generally have nothing of interest to say.  I have never "blogged" before but, just like drugs I have decided to give it a try.  Today I attended my local church, made a peanut butter and jelly (I also forgot to mention my love of the culinary arts), drank half a bottle of moderately priced wine and enjoyed the final Simpsons episode of the season (worst episode ever).  My favorite authors are Thoreau, Emerson, Pirsig, Eliot Coleman, Helen and Scott Nearing, Rob Roy, and Steven King.  I have large ambitions but a much less than required drive to achieve them.  Some day I hope to own (as much as you can own land you pay taxes on) a small homestead where I can garden, read, contemplate, make music, create art, and learn to do all these things in a holy way so to touch god....or something.  I have managed to save perhaps half of the required money to buy land in the area I am looking and am somewhat excited about making a change.  Well, that's a big enough run on paragraph so I will close here and check to see what my blogg page looks like, if this new fangled technology works, ect... thanks for useing a moment of time you'll never get back to learn a little bit about me, your friendly neiborhood shut-in.
