          Exams are finally over!          It had been days since I haven had a good night sleep, revising my notes for my exams. On Monday, 12.30pm, tuesday, 12.30, and Wednesday, 1.00am! I guess I must have broke the record for sleeping at such a time this year, just to rush through my final draft for thursday's exam. Finally, I can have abundant sleep. Finally. (Am I too much?)      What a day! My friends all had gone out, except for me, having to go home so early to have my lunch. These, is not what I wanted, but I have got no idea whether my mother allow. Will she? I guess probably no.   Reason: Sars, and I haven had enough rest for these three days.    So, that's the reason I went home, just to had a "nice" rest. ;)      On Monday, there's a rehearsal for one of our teachers in school, Mr Lau, (although i don't know him much)and we are singing for his wedding! Mr Thomas is also having his wedding on that day but he has decided not to have any of us sing in his wedding. What a disappointment! Moreover, only the chosen 20 people can sang for the wedding. In this case, I guess i'm going to be the only sec two girl there. Argh! Never mind, at least my all my seniors are good. :) Just hope I got someone to go with.      "Hardship" has just passed and now comes the other...SYF! Many people must have forgetten about that.;) I guess we have to sacrifice our holidays to it. If it wasn't for sars, we would have known the result, maybe a gold...Two more weeks, and here comes holiday. I guess the chances of me going out is really scarce. How I wish I could go out,...maybe to Escape! Maybe to ask my primary school friends along, but I guess I should ask my mother when holiday approaches. Hope she'll grant my permission.     I guess I'll just write til here. Bye!

        urlLink        Hello! I'm back!          1st of June today! With just an blink of an eye, the holidays are just a week ahead. What a tiring day, having to spent the rest of today, "mending" up those sleepless nights I had. What a wonderful day yesterday!      On 29th of may, we had finally sang in Mr Lau's wedding. Being the first time attending such a wedding held in church, my mind of full of thoughts. Maybe, I could hold my wedding in such a church next time. Maybe, but I'm not a christian! Well, these things will have to leave it til the day I have decided to get married.      I didn't expect so many teachers to come! Miss Ng Siew Yong, my last year form teacher, Mr Soon, my form teacher, Mrs Choy, Miss Lim, Miss Sabariah, and Mr Ng! To tell you seriously, I was trembling when I saw them and I was afraid that I may faint when I sang. But I did not, heehee. After singing, we had take photos with Mr Lau and his wife. Besides that, we had a chance to eat their food! Although I had think that we didn't sang very well, we were amazed to get praises from people. Finally, we then got changed and head back to school at around 4.45.      From school, me, hui xuan and hannah, went to watch tjchoir sing. Winnie's choir! The journey had been a long one, having to board the train from Yio Chu Kang to Bedok and the bus from bedok interchange to Temasek Junior college.      When we reached there, there were temperature taking again. People may think that its nothing special to tok about, but when i had my temperature taken, it was 37.5! I was panicking that time as i thought they might call me to go home. However, instead of doing so, they told me to rest for a while again. When my temperature was taken again, 37.6! My goodness! Luckily, they had allowed me to go in as I'm still feeling quite ok. What a day!       In the auditorium, the enclosure was big! However, we had waited there for about a long time until it started at about 8.30! :S They had made us wait for about 1 hr.       Finally, the concert started! What a choir! They sang a series of songs, such as Balland of the Green Broom and Elijah Rock. Next, there was an interval before the next part begins. It was my most favourite part of all, as they sang a series of disney songs while dancing and being dressed in four different colours, red, orange, yellow and green. Songs like Hakuna Matata, I just can't wait to be king, Can you feel the love tonight, Colours of the Wind, Bare Necessities, Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, Hihohiho "seven drawfs", Some day my prince will come, when you wish upon a star and lots more were sang. How I wish I could watch them sang again. Some songs, had indeed brought a lot of memories to me. But it's over now. How great it is to sing in such a wonderful choir, how wonderful.       It's around 10.30pm when the show finishes, and I reached home at 12 something. How lucky it is to have an opportunity in watching this musical. Hope I'll have a chance to watch them again. Hopefully.

        Talking about miracle, our miracle really happen! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   We've got a    SILVER   for our SYF choir!!!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A silver for us indeed, and we had never let our seniors down! What a long waiting award we've been waiting for...Indeed a long story before coming to achieve such a goal. If I'm correct, I think I've read one of my seniors journal when he had written about the 2001's SYF. The fact for the numorous practices they have been through, and the fact that they had went out of pitch during the previous competition. It had really been a dream come true to all my choir seniors, especially the upper sec. How touching and grateful that we can manage to make their dream come true. And as for us in two year's time, our target is gold...  Although it's already a fews day since we know our results, thinking back, I'm so touched, very touched for such a good result we had achieve. So touch that my tears almost came off my eyes. Recalling, it's like just having competition yesterday, in high spirits after getting our result. Our miracle has came...  Really grateful to all people who help and encourage us. Miss Yee, our conductor, Mr Nah, our pianist, Yang Kai, helper, Mrs Wong, other teachers in charge and lastly our Principal, Mrs Tan who had given us so much support. Without them, things won't come true...as well as our efforts we had put in.   Thanksgiving tomorrow! After one burden is gone, another comes! I'm going to receive my prize tommorrow! That might be great going up there to receive prize, but I'm going to wear the choir gown, plus make-up! Sign~, I guess I've to go on with it. Really excited for tommorrow! Meeting winnie tomorrow and it's going to be a very long day! Thanksgiving til 11 in the morning, next is mega project! So troublesome! I've to sell my shirt:( If any body is to see my shirt, there a purple orchid drawn on it! Please buy, although i knew it's ugly. haiz~   You know, my feelings are very mixed nowadays. "Crushes" and all sort of things. I know that I've just encounter a fall of relationship months ago. In case people want to know, I do really think much about it nowadays. I don't even know I still like him a not, or even have crush on another guy. I really dun know, and I don't wish to talk about it now.   I quite happy with my friends now. Shang Yi, tanya, yvonne and yuan wen who are always singing songs with me during break time. I was thinking of even setting up an ensemble...haha. Aren't singing fun? When one is to be in a certain mood, they can just simply sing to let out their worries, unhappiness.   That's all I'm going to write! Hope everything will go well this week! Sad to hear of the news of our SYF band. They really shouldn't get those sort of result and could have obtain a silver award too! They practise day and night, day and dawn, with lots of effort they've put it. Maybe the judges dunno how to judge them, but don't give up! "Losing a key to success" in chinese and as well as the dance. Hope they achieve a silver award like us too!  Jia You!!   Yi Tian  "There can be miracles, when you believe..."

        Stress and tension seemed to be around me these days. Worries everywhere and I have almost ever lasting things to things I have encountered this few days...  Recently, there've been a student counsellor election. I very much wanted to be one, as I've never ever been one before. In primary school, not even once. Maybe I just too unsuitable to be one. Maybe I'll never be one the whole of my life. Silly of me right? Why worry for such things? However, when the class counsellor was trying to persuade some to join Student counsellor, I became half heartened. I very much wanted to enjoy the fun the counsellors have, and try to help lead the school, but why now? Because I just dun want to add another burden my back. I already have choir and I've setting my goals to get into the first class. I must work hard.    As there happened to be choir practice that day, two of my choir pals Shang Yi and Tanya had wanted to take MEP (music elective program). I had also very wanted to take that too, but the thing is that, will I enter the first class next year? Will I break down, having so much things to cope with. And these time, I've got two things to decide, student counsellor and MEP. I really confused now? Will I be able to cope with it?   I know some of the people might think how mad of me to go MEP and having a risk of going A. But music is my interest! I like music, and it's part of my ambition to become somebody of what I want! Maybe people like choir conductor, choir soloist, ... piano teacher and so on.. I have already seek my whole family's advice! My mother, my auntie, my uncle..and all they say were take all and that will benefit me. What to do?   After a hour of thoughts and thinking, I came with my decision -- Not to go for Student counsellor and take MEP. As the result, I came upon this decision to take music. I'm still worrying though..and my mother had disallow my to join studnet counsellor.   And so, the worst came today. There had been a B boys basketball national final match between our school and Gan Eng Seng. The good news is that, we won! But however, I had been almost stress out and break into a cry when people start asking me about whether they could go for the match instead of sectionals. If that's what people who think of it, can you think of what you have answer miss yee when she ask us about the goal we wish to get in the syf competition? Gold! But can we get it if we don't sacriface for the sectionals to aim and do well? Practice makes perfect! If all people like you think the same ways, think of getting COP instead. Yes! you might say it's only one practice, but we already don't have much time! a fews more practices, it's already competition! Can't people think and thought of it? I was very disappointed, very very disappointed that I almost cried. Is the match so important that one will die if he or she don't watch it? No! Think about it! We must together grab at what we want, and no just say it without thinking. Do it!   Will there be still hope left for the choir? Nobody noes, but there'll still be if we try our very best now and make sacrifaces for it. We must get a better goal instead of broze this year! We will pray hopefully that there'll be a miracle. A miracle given to us for all the effort we've put it...  Yi Tian

        Hello everybody! Back after a long day of performance. Here am I, drowsy and weary, with all achings all over. Achings from the 2.4 km run. Argh! What a unlucky day yesterday, to have PE and performance on the same day.   Recalling from now..we did actually quite nicely for the SYF performance to me, to the fact that we never panic when the audience laugh. What on earth are those people laughing about. Some people say is our choir photos. Maybe some funny photos. mm, should have seek our permission before putting out on presentation. :S   Yesterday's NE test isn't really a test. It's a survey. Well, quite a lot of it ask us whether we like singapore and things like that. We are going to take it again during Sec 4! Luckily, we were allowed to leave early for the concert. And we manage to get there on time! And sigh of relief!~   I missed SYF practice yesterday! Well, actually, I prefer going for choir practice than prize giving rehearsal. Now only two more practice left til the actual performance! We must work very hard! Must get gold! ;)   Thanksgiving too! Sign~ becoz of thanksgiving, I had to lost two tultion lessons! $50 a lesson! Plus chinese oral on the following sat, that means three! Well, I had a 'arguement' with my mother just now. She wanted me to change to wednesday's lesson, but I dun feel like it. It's like, never saying any farewell to the saturday tultion pals. :( In the end, I'm still going to miss the lessons...  Mmm, I remember when i went for my tultion today, I saw there's a multi-cultural carnival held by many schools in fuchun cc! There's woodgrove(my primary school), canberra, sembawang, admiralty, fuchun, masiling...But I only went for tultion! The building was so crowded today! I should have stay there longer after my tultion.   Quite late now, 11.45! Writing journal at this hour may be mad for me, but I've got nothing to do. So, look out for my next entry and nite!   "Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing you would say good bye..." bye!   "Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettle and warm woolen mittens..."

            Hello friends! This is Yi Tian here, introducing a song I've just make into midi...My Memory (Winter Sonata). I may be mad about this, but I beg your pardon as this had been my first even midi created. Sit back and enjoy!      Back from a recent trip to my friend's house today, I realised what a tiring day I had have! We did nothing over there actually except for watching "Finding Nemo", playing neopets, and chat in msn. Talking about her, she owned a dog!(a black, small dog)Quite a cute dog actually, except for time when it barks at me. Man's best friend. ;) But I thought it might be smelly sometimes, haha.      Back in school today, quite a normal one for me actually. The history test today was super easy! :S How stupid of me to go and study so...many things, except for one question.    "Name the first protector of the chinese in Singapore."   My Ans: William Picketering   Correct Ans: William Pickering    Argh! That question annoys me most out of so many question.(Although it worth only 1 mark out of 15) Silly of me right? Should have learn to spell the name...       SYF performance in school 2ml! (Well, I guess I'll have to pack as soon as I offline) Besides, many things are happening 2ml! Now, what worries me had been the NE test! Why must they crush on the same day? I wonder what kind of questions they're going to ask. Hopefully not about 100 questions and I can make it to the SYF performance! Besides me taking, there's shang yi, yvonne, tanya...so on.       After performance, come prize giving presentation and thanksgiving combined rehearsal.. It's together anyway, so no need to worry for it! I wonder how that day is going to be like, wearing the choir uniform to stage, taking my prize from the guest of honour. Unlucky me! Haha, once again, not only me anyway! still got and few of my seniors too...;)       There's also syf practice after that again! that counts down to two more practice before the actually competition..Jia You to all! Especially ALL choir members! We ought to give our every effort by singing well! If we want gold, go strive hard to get it! Instead of just saying it out without any serious thought of work hard. There are many choices for the way you think of it.   We will get gold,  We can get gold,  we may get gold,  But why not,  We MUST get gold?  (P.S. I use to do that during the coming days of PSLE.)  That's all I'm gonna write! Give comments and I give the best of luck for those who were competing in SYF. Bye!!

          Back from holidays! I miss my normal school days, friends, choir, and...homework! Jking.     A brand new start of a new school term! Back to the holidays, sorry for not writing during that time!  To think back, I've been to a lot of fun during the holidays. Summarising briefly...    First week of holidays! Monday, I've been to Escape Theme Park! (with yvonne, ko sin, jocelyn) Though it's my fourth time going there, it's quite fun though. However! Stupid thing that I've discovered a Human skull on pole while sitting the "Wet and Wild". :( *I'm afraid of human skulls since young!  Well, I still sit that ride though...:D (plus 4x inverter and lots more!)     Thursday! [Agent Cody Banks]... I'm sure people knows this movie. A nice show actually, recommanded for everyone, about a boy who became a secret agent to solve a mission. I actually watch it with my primary school friends! (shi yu & min er)Then, off library we go! To read and borrow books of course!:P      Followed by choir practice on friday, I watch a german choir sing on saturaday (14 june), {Gloria Dei 2003} with miss yee, our choir conductor, playing on the piano! The soloists sang quite nice for the first part(though they keep repeating), and I like the second sop soloist! Then comes the exciting part! {joseph and his technicolour coat} "Jacob, jacob and sons..."       Well, nothing up except for choir practices on the second week. However, I rided the bicycle at pasir ris park for the second time on the thirth week(saturaday, having fallen twice, and almost colliding with other people. I have finally learn how to ride the bicycle! haha. Besides that, I played kites, and kick "football" with my brothers and cousin. Quite fun actually. :) Then comes choir practice, and homework, projects.. I bought my harry potter and the order of pheonix on wednesday too. Nice! But I hate that stupid Professor Umbrige and Sirius die, let the magic continues...   Just been to the rehearsal in the Nanyang girls' Auditorium. Although we didn't do well, we must continue to strive hard! Well, it may seem hard to achieve gold, but we must have our perserverence and goals...so strive hard towards what we what!    You know what? Our maths teacher, Miss Chung had been a teacher in charge of our CCa too! Some say lei, some say lar, I say alamak! Well, becoz i'm the maths rep. in class, I know what's she like. The way she teaches, damn loud, but well, I can say she's...a nice teacher also, for those who behave well lar. During school time, I had to face her during maths lessons. During choir practice, I will see her there too!     That's all I'm gonna write! Maybe I'll continue on saturday..Who knows? Back to the world of magic...my book of OWLs (Ordinary Wizard Levels), jking lar! A chip off the harry potter book before going off to sleep. Dumblegore's Army off we go!  Expelliarmus!   Expecto Patronum!  Bye!    Piak!   Apparate to bed

        Tigger Jump!   Exams are over and it's camp tommorrow! And now, I'm all smiles! Hahaha..."Smiling is contagious.."   Back to typing about these few days...  I've been confidence with my maths yesterday, even though I didn't complete two questions. The paper was quite easy average. Just hope I'll score well for it!   Everybody were all restless and already in holiday mood while trying to rush through their art pieces. I slept at 12.30am once again after half way completing my final draft, and had completed the rest of it between 5 to 6 am in the morning. There goes my yawning again. "Ar.."  My Art Piece...;)  Talking about my art pieces, I've choose to do on "Life in School". I've drawn musical notes, keyboard, light bulb, flying books, paper birds, saturn, DNA, conical flask and lastly...a blue feather, all floating in the sky.   Why in the sky? Especially for the flying paper bird and blue feather, it describes my school life as a carefree and happy life. Paper bird because, just like a wild bird, it leads a life, able to interact with the other parts of the world. For us, we are able to see and interact with many people who are different from you.   Flying books describes the freedom to learn and receive more and newer knowledge, while the floating light bulb represents the freedom to express your ideas and thoughts.  As for the musical notes and keyboard, it describes the ability for discovering ande expressing special talents in school, such as musical ones.   Last of all, the picture of saturn, a DNA molecule and a  conical flask, represents varies interest of the subjects I've learnt in school. They represent astronomy, biology and chemistry respectively.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The leadership camp will be held tomorrow. What a rush, as I've to rush and pack all the neccessary things by tonight. Can't they wait til the following week? I'll not have a good night sleep until friday! :( And worse still, there's choir practice on friday. Such a week!   That's all I'm going to write. I'll be looking forward to the receiving of our exam papers next week and be optimistic! (although I've no confidence for some subjects) I'll have to pray hard for good rest these two nights at school and make me feel energised tomorrow! Bye!      When you wish upon a star...     Winnie's TJChoir concert coming! People going please tell me ok? I don't want to go alone. Looking forward to see the disney dance again, yeah!    The bright and beautiful Belle!

        How do we work hard? Some say through studying, but what if you've already studied for it? Sometimes I just don't know why. Whenever I got back the results of the subjects which I had confidence on, the marks didn't come out as what I've expected. I'm so scare I might do badly this year.    As I saw my friends' results today, they've done better than me, except for certain subjects. Sometimes I really don't understand myself. Why can't I complete the papers in the exact time given? It has been my worse results I've received the whole of this year, despite having my marks somewhere around the average. Has going online affect my results?   Many of my subjects dropped, except for chinese, history and literature. Maths because I couldn't complete my paper on time. Many friends had got better than me! Most of them getting above 40 upon 50. Me? 34.5. According to percentage,  it's 70 /100. I wish to score well, but can I? How can I urge myself to score well?   I've got 21 / 30 for literature. If not for my slowness in work, I could have written more points for my last two essay questions. My first two questions had help me on getting this marks. How can I really complete my work at the exact time given? Am I a slow pouch? How can I score better?   Perhaps I'm better at humanities. I've score 77 / 100 for history! I just hope I can still obtain such results during the final end paper. I've got 80 / 100 for chinese, and in fact, the chinese paper was easy. Many people in my class had score quite high for it.   Sometimes I don't get myself. Why is it that whenever my chinese improve, my other subjects will drop? Is there any link between it? Whether if it's true a not, I must urge myself to study even more hard. I must clear all bad habit I had and have time management in the things I do.   Science is the only subject left now...I just hope to do well. Will my marks dropped? I guess I've always done badly in common test, but with these results, I must take it as a lesson to help me improve, and to achieve the goal I ever wanted.   Will I get into the triple science class next year? It'll depend on my end of year performance during the final year paper. I must study harder to get what I want. I really must.

         Back from Bishan Park B, I'm so tired! In fact, we've had done so many exercises today! Running, walking, cycling and roller blading. Is eating included? Maybe not..but we had a lot of fun after the jogathon today.   At 6.55am, von, jo, wan yee and I board bus 13 to Bishan Park. We didn't really know much about that place, but me, adeline, yvonne and jocelyn had gone to bishan park 2 to cycle (and roller blade except me)before. Luckily there were two secondary one boys boarding the same bus to "guide us" (actually, we followed them) to the park. On the way, we met our school teachers and followed them to our reporting point.   The race was began with the C boys running, followed by C girls, B boys and B girls. Everyone has to run or jog 3.3km! Me, sok ying, xin fang and shiang yng were running together during the event. David house win!! Haha, I was able to "predict" that! Two of our class boys had got into the top twenty C boys, and we were shocked because our class hardly have our name annouced.   Me, asoka, chia, addy, von, jo, koko were planning to roller blade in Bishan Park 2 when our class were selected as school ambassadors. While we were having hard times on whether we could finish it, Mr Soon gave us a clever plan---> to place it in the letter sort of HDB flats. And we did it! So off we head off to our destination.  The roller blade shop were closed when we were there. In order to kill our time, chia, asoka and me went cycling! As it was sok ying's first time riding, we have tried to teach her how to ride. At 12pm when the shop opened, we had all gone to learn roller skating! I didn't intend to learn it at first, but decided to try it in the end. Roller blading was fun! While learning it, we've keep falling on our butts and our knees. Other secondary ones who were present skated better than us! If I could skate that well..maybe it'll takes ages. What a day! Each of us had play until we thought it was sunday tomorrow.   So tired..I'm going to eat my dinner now. Bye!   "Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens..."    Yi Tian

          I've finally finished my exams!      I've finally finish my last paper..Chinese! In fact, it was the only paper I feel it was easy. Was it easy? I heard many of my friends saying that the sections behind were difficult. But why do I think it's easy? Just hope I score well for that subject!   Jogathon 2ml! Last year's Jogathon was held in the MacRitche Reservoir, but this year's in Bishan Park 1. The whole school will have to report over there at 7.30 am in our house t-shirt. Another house competition again! Hope David will win this round! My friends and I are planning to go to Sembawang Park after the run. Some want to learn roller-blade and I want to cycle!! Hope to have fun tomorrow.   Me, von, jo, addy and koko (haha, my classmates) have been to koko's house today! Before that, we actually had our lunch in Northpoint food court. Koko, jo and I ate po pian, while von and addy ate japanese rice. We then went to Minitoons to buy a present for one of our classmate's belated present. (We even bought our sweets there! haha)   In Koko's house, we talked, sang and heard music from Ko sin's radio! Although we've gone home quite late, we've talked a lot and share certain topics together. Quite a meaningful visit!   In my past past entry, I forgot to mention about us, going to the Ledo Cineplex as a school during the national day eve! Before we made our trip there by MRT, Jack Neo came to our school! Everyone was so excited and together we've watched the movie..."Home Run". First ever big event organise by the school since the change of our principal...;).   On 15 of August, it was another lesson-free day(entrepreneurship day)! It was a day which celebrates the habour of the hard work put in during the holding of megaproject. Presentation by the groups were held and Jack Neo came again! Haha, it seems like Jack Neo likes our school so much..;).   Besides that, it's also a charity day. The whole school were helping the NKF children's medical fund by selling the pens to the pubilc. Me, Rachel, Caryn and Sok Ying were "send" to Boon Keng MRT Station to work. It was my very first time doing this, and the worst thing is that,  the place was so deserted! In the end, we manage to sell one-third of our pens each. Some of our class's boys were also there! What a fun experience to us...  That's all I'm going to write! (Maybe a rough one, cause I'm going to sleep) Bye!    Yi Tian

        *Addition to this entry..   Happy 38th Birthday, Singapore!    Mmm, although it's a bit late, well, Singapore still celebrates its 38th independance day. Too lazy to write in 2 weeks, heehee...  Introducing my 2nd ever song I've made into midi--> Ubi Caritas! Well, I've always wanted to have a midi of it, and now...mission accomplished! While listening this song from time to time, it brings back the days when the choir had sung it during our choir practice, as well as our choir performance held last year.  What does Ubi Caritas means actually? From what I recall, I remember means something about "God and love"? Whether it's about the one above a not, I enjoyed singing this song so much. (I'm not a christian) Although we sopranos had to keep repeating "ubi caritas et amor", I enjoyed a small part sang by the altos; the part near the the end of the song. "Exsultemus etinipso jucundemur..."  Common test next week! Seems like just a twink of an eye. You know what, we had actually had another replay for our thanksgiving during the friday's assembly, 1st of August. Just imagine...wear the choir gown 4 times within a month to perform, haha. After a week of rest for SYF, we finally had our choir practice on tuesday! Yipee!(I've always love choir practices)   We are going to thailand during the december holidays! I've been thinking that thailand isn't a nice place after all, but maybe not. There maybe beautiful scenary..and we are going to perform in one of the greatest university over there! Just hope my mother allow...  We are also having a school concert in at the end of year! The choir will be performing, as well as the band and dance in the Singapore Conference Hall. Nice place a not? Should be, cause the place quite big...and my uncle works there! Maybe I can see him when we went to perform...:) I've been there a lot of times! To see my primary school's concert, teenagers performing solo items on chinese instruments as well as piano. I just can't wait for the day to come..  Mentioning of going to thailand, my history teacher had wanted to bring us to "death railway" during the september holidays for a heritage trip to learn about the POWs (prisoners of war) during the WW2, who built the railway during that time. I wanted to go..but my mother, haiz... "Cannot! Later got terrorism. See the news? Just now got dunno what place bomb! Next time then go lar, never go won't die one right?"   I'll have to WAIT then...5 days four 4 nights during holidays! Haiz ya..go for choir practice lar. (I like that too anyway) ;) That's all I'm gonna write!   Yi Tian  "ETian from Hume.."    11 August 2003   Mmm, I don't usually do this, but for my past entry on "Downcast.." To me actually, well, this decision are actually part of your future plans. If you don't decid it carefully, just a miss of one step, everything will just go down the bin.   Counsellor? HPT? I've already made my decisions on joining MEP coz it takes up just lesser time than counsellor. It's just that, being a counsellor isn't a must, just getting extra cca marks and train your leadership, that's all, and why take up so many things? It won't help you with your science, maths and all other stuffs. Just choir and singing is enough for me, really enough and contented.  Taking more doesn't mean you'll be happier. In fact, unhappier.    I'm not being a show-off to anybody actually. Seriously. You know how it's like being one? I hate people who show off too. I'm also not thinking so high of myself, getting into the first class, is it so easy for me? NO! There are competitors around me and many people obting A as their first choice. I may and may not get into the triple science, but the matter is, whether if I care to work hard, and do my best in the work. Everybody hopes to go into first class too! I'm just having a test, and testing to see if I have the ability. If I have, I try to cope with it; if not, I'll have lesser things to do. I'm also cheering my mother up part of the time.   Do people have two brothers like me at home, playing a fool when it comes to homework, and always think of an excuse to "escape" doing of homework? At least my third brother isn't so, but even now, I had difficulty teaching my kindergarten brother to learn simple spelling words like "red", "blue" and "green". I've to spend hours trying to get these words into his mind and after 3 hours of training, he can't get any word spelt out?  Many people knows that I've a primary 6 brother, but not many knows which stream is he in, or how well did he do in his work. In fact, my brother is in EM3. He's in EM2 at first during primary 5, but a subject had always pull him down time to time ---> maths. Have I help him? Yes! From time to time, I have gone through the maths problems with him, but in the end, everything has gone down to the bin. People had seldom ask me about him, and I dun even dare to tell anyone.   My mother is only good in chinese but poor in english. As the result, my second brother only does well in chinese. Helping my brother is the only thing I can do, before his PSLE comes. I really hope he will improve his maths, really hope so. Whether he can try his best to do well, depends on him, himself.   Don't wish to talk about it anymore, but I hope people understand. I''ve been getting along with a lot my classmates, as well as my sec 1 juniors...:) and choir pals! Forget to mention that the farewell for sec 4e and 5n choir pple is on 22 august as well as our SYF celebration. Just hope it'll be a unforgetable one for our big big seniors!  Yi Tian  "tuna!"

       English final Year Paper on friday. Am I prepare enough? My 2nd brother is having his first PSLE paper soon too on monday. Will he pass? It's seem to me that as if there were thousands and thousands of "unanswerable" questions, shot pass my mind. I just knew no answer to it...  Going online has really become a daily habit of mine. Couldn't I just resist it? Because is this, my results weren't as good as before. The time spend on homework were simply almost, less than the the time spend in front of my computer. Numerous of money spend on electricity, precious study time wasted...  Tomorrow have to really be the last day before I went on revising. The coming paper was just so important to me, and it matters my whole entire education. Can I get into the class I wanted? As days of the exams approaches, I began to think of it thoroughly. Reading this maybe ridiculous, but it matters. It really matters a lot to me. Am I becoming more and more competitive? Sometimes, I just don't understand the change in me. Not the same yi tian as compared to the primary school her.   Perhaps people in my class don't really think so. A quiet girl I am. But there are simply many thoughts I refuse to let it out. The changed me. Since when I've began to take exams so seriously?   A Test To Come  Exams around the corner,  Tense composure around.  Lack of time to think,  Just revising.(and frowns)    Tons of different worries,  Shot to my mind. Will I achieve and get The worse? I shall strive...  *Just a simple poem I've think of. No really good at poetry at all.   That's all I'm gonna write until the final exams are over! Good Luck to all and remember, " You reap what you sow ". Practice Makes Perfect!  *PS don't send any unimportant mails to me!

       I've finally had my piano exams. People might have wonder, how well have I done this time? Maybe I don't even get the chance to pass. Who knows? I really have no confidence in my piano exam this time. Will I fail badly?   The day before my exam, I had practised my piano pieces til midnight. Major scales, harmonic and melodic minor scales, contrary montion and lots of scales to practise. My piano pieces? I've played numorous times til there is no mistake. Why had nervousness kill me? I simply don't understand.   Yesterday had been a nervous and depress day for me. In the morning, the 2-3 choir members were told to sing the school song for the coming acting minister in our school. It was annouced through the annoucement at first, but I had heard it as 3-4. Luckily did xu man came to inform us. I was so excited! Singing again.  When we've reached 4 faith's classroom, the people were half way through singing our school song. Isn't it lucky that we've managed to reached there on time?  Yang Hui was playing on the piano and Mrs Wong had wanted Yvonne (sec three), to learn to play the school song. As I watched yvonne play, I had thought and knew, that someday, it's going to be me who will be playing on the piano, when the next next batch graduated. Someday, but will I ever play as well as yang hui? Maybe not. Nervousness kills me. The piano that time simply make me nervous of my piano exam.   1.00pm, just the time when my literature lesson ends. As I packed my bag, my classmates send regards(*Thanks!), and I went down to the canteen to see my mother and younger brother waiting. My exam were held in hougang. In the 1 hour's time, I'll be in the examiner's room, playing the scales and my piano pieces.   When I'm finally in the examiner's room, I just felt so nervous. Almost every scale that I played are played twice. For my piano pieces, there were mistakes while playing. Sightreading, I just couldn't played a complete song. In fact, it didn't sound like a song.   On my way back home, my mother had told me not to feel upset about it. I have just no confidence in passing. I've laid on the glass panel of the side seat and felt so tired that I just fell asleep. So depress and tired. Can I ever get rid of nervousness?  With one bunden down, the next bunden draws nearer. Final year exams. Sometimes, I really wonder how I would be able to make it the 2nd in class last year. I really wonder how did I do it. Is it because of luck? Or is it because that my other subjects had pulled me up? I've never done that well in my own life before. Never. I just really hope I can do well for my english, maths and science... as well as all the subjects to pull up my overall marks? Will I do the same this time? I just pray for a miracle to happen...

       Back to school, and with a blink of an eye, I'm starting term 4! Maybe it's really a blink of an eye, with so many things happening. Problems at home, problem in school, but I just simply live through life continuously.   Recently I've just read a book. Maybe some of the people in my class knows. It's called Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas by James Patterson. I've got the book during the prizegiving this year. For those who are interested, you can borrow it from me!   In this book, it describes that life is like a game in which you are juggling five balls. The balls are called work, family, health, friends and integrity. And you are keeping all of them in the air. But one day, you finally understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. The other four balls - family, health, friends, integrity - are made of glass. If you drop one of these, it will be irrevocably scuffed, nicked, perhaps even shattered.   People have to learn to live life cheerfully and enjoy every moment of your life, as life is really short. Leave all sorrows behind you and simply enjoy every single moment of your life.   Yesterday was really a sick day for me. I've got stomachache and diarrhea early in the morning. And back in school, my forehead starts to feel warm. I never told my friends actually, and I don't want to go home on a choir day. Throughout lessons, my head just felt so dizzy, and I kept placing my head on the table. I don't want to miss any lessons!   I've got fever! However, I've stayed in school for almost the whole day..first time, maybe second. I had fever on the second day of my primary 5 camp, unlucky right? I missed treasure hunting! Hope I don't get the same incident next year!   During choir practice, luckily there was no sectionals that day! I had to rub my head for numerous times and people sitting around are helping to ask for panadol or ointment. Thanks hui si and phebe! And people around me too! Actually, I felt that it's troublesome for you people to do so..but thanks! I'm feeling much better now, except for my stomach.  I've finally reached home at about 7 pm! And guess what? My brother had also got the same "disease" as me. Maybe his was much worser. Luckily there was no hw to pass up the next day..But Maths Test! It's easy anyway, hope to pass! (I study it on the way to school)   Common test in about two weeks' time! We've just receive the final year exams' timetable. Secondary two streaming! I guess I've got to put my best effort in it. My piano practical exam is next wednesday! I've not confidence that I can pass this time. Really not confidence.   My piano teacher, why does she have to keep changing my practice timing? If she ever forgets to teach me aural for today's practice, I'm going to request my mother to change another piano teacher. Really so! Why am I always so lazy in practising? I just don't understand myself. Can't I be more hardworking in practising piano?   Two weeks to exams, and teachers are already rushing with their teachings? Why is it so rush for us this time? Many unlucky things happened this year all around the world. Will things eventually improved? Nobody can predict the future...  Yi Tian

        A camp in which the camp commitee had planned on. Is it a nice one? Maybe quite average, but I get to see the true face of certain people...  Why do people give up so easily? Is it because of certain unexpected things happening, or too tired to continue? It maybe difficult to go on, but what happens when it comes to life? In life, people encounter problems very often. To live on, people had to just ignore them.   People had put the blame on the commitee because of the Amazing Race we had planned. They had blamed on us for being unable to find their clues...but they had not even make their best effort to find it! This makes me really disappointed. Really so. Although I didn't do much for this camp, I could feel how the game organisers feel, taking most of the blame.   Out of the whole camp, I felt that we were unorganised. If we could be given enough time, we could have do it even better. To wonder seriously, am I doing my work? Have I done most of the work that I am supposed to do? Whenever I'm in the group meeting, I just feel that I am doing so less work. I wanted to help, but I just don't know want to do. Useless right?   The Amazing Race we had planned on is quite messy too. We learned that by pasting post-it notes with scott tape isn't good after all, as it may come off quite easily after a short time. I f we could think of something that is more effective and sticky, we wouldn't have these problems. May blue-tac and scott tape plus super glue?   The clues were also quite mess up, but this was due to shortage of time. Some of the groups had also tore off the other groups clues, some just couldn't make their best effort in finding it and had given up.  Many expected things just happened yesterday. One of the girl just went missing after knowing that her group had lost in the captain's ball match. The commitee members, including some of the choir members had tried to look for her, and finally found her crying and walking towards a group of people.   There's one thing I just don't understand, it's just only a game! Why should one matters? A day of fun had just be ruined by her.   Will we be able to organise another camp again? Hopefully yes after the final year exams, but will people still come and let it be a fun and successful one? Nobody knows...

        The muscial was so touching yesterday! $20 worth it, although the view from the top was damn High! Does anyone noes where to buy the CD? If anyone wants to noe the story, ..here's part of it..   Kate Carl was invited to the Forbidden City to paint a portait of Empress Dowager Cixi. On the train trip, she met a journalist, named George, and she heard lots and lots of bad rumours on how the Empress was like. A evil dragon lady who murder her own son?  The truth side of the Empress Cixi finally reveals, when Kate enters the Forbidden City. She wanted to know how Empress Cixi was like, being an lady of 50s to 60s that time. There, Kate started painting the Empress's eyes while listening to how the Empress was like when she's young.   (Kit Chan) Young Cixi known as Yehonala that time in her 16, first arrived at the palace as one of the thousand ladies who is to get chosen by the Qing Emperor Xianfeng, to be his concubine. She was chosen as the emperor's concubine.   As soon as Cixi was pregnant with the emperor's child, the emperor had stopped to visit her. She was brought to the summer palace, where she gave birth to the emperor's only son, Tong Zhi and rose to power overnight.   As War came to China, the emperor's health became weaker, and on the night before the emperor die, Tong Zhi became the emperor at the age of 5. Unfortunately, Tong Zhi die at the age of 18 with the disease. Overgrieved, Cixi sat sadly at Tong Zhi's side, cleaning him with her handkerchief. Soon, Guang Xu, Cixi's nephew took over the throne at the age of three. With the help of Cixi, Guang Xu learned to rule China day by day. When Guang Xu came up with an idea to introduce western ideas to China, Cixi agreed to it, but there were many bloodshed on the streets in the end.   The portrait was finally finished, and George, the journalist had actually made use of Kate to write bad things about the Empress Dowager Cixi. The empress had no longer trust Kate any more after the pubilshed of the book by George. As the portrait of the empress was being shown to the people, Kate had no way of pursuing the people that the Empress Dowager Cixi was a nice person...  I may have missed out some parts, but the show was really nice. No regards on spending so much money. If anybody got the CD out there, please lend it to me! Thanks!    Yi Tian

        urlLink    Busy again! I've arrived home at 7.30 pm just now from school! Collecting of camp money, meeting of the coming choir camp...It's going to be very fun!!! Muahahaha...  It's my first time having to teach my section the new song "Simple gifts" alone. Well, did I teach well? Maybe not..making a fool in front of my piano, but i managed to finish the song within 30 min...because some sec threes had already know the songs. Miss Yee had wanted the whole section to sing after we entered the room! I was so scared and nervous, when I realised that I failed to taught them the changes of tempo in some places. Luckily, it's only that "minor" mistake, as Miss Yee also had not scolded me for that. We only sing the song twice! Maybe not so lucky next time...  I've tultion for english at British Council tomorrow. Watching of 'Forbidden City' by Kit Chan after that! There maybe only 45 mins for me to report to school at 1.15, but I'm sure to make it. I'm going under my music teacher Mr Ng, but can I go with my choir seniors?   Home Econs practical exam is on the first friday when school reopens! I'm really very worried, can I cope with it? I've got history assignment, practical test to prepare, maths remedial to go, art assignment to do, and piano practical exams to prepare! I really must cope with it. Really must...  I'm looking forward to our camp again! Whether it will be fun a not, I'm sure it's going to be a successful one to lead us to organise such things in future, especially a 3D2N camp during the Nov and Dec holidays!   I'm really going to stop organising such activity when school reopens and when the camp ended, only after the final year exams that I'll sure to get involved. I must really concentrate on my studies soon.   During the coming days of my PSLE, I would usually do this...  I will get As and A*s for PSLE, I shall get As and A*s for PSLE, I can get As and A*s for PSLE... I MUST try and get As and A*s for PSLE!  And now using this in my exams...  I will get into Combination A,  I shall get into Combination A, I can get into Combination A... I MUST try and get into Combination A!   Hopefully this "method" could pull my confidence up.. Practice really makes perfect!  Yi Tian

        Report card day! Well, Teacher's day has just passed, and many things are happening and happening! By just looking at the report card, the first thing i see will be...   English Language -   48   Actually, that's the only red mark I've received throughout both common test. Hopefully, there will be none during final year exams. You know what? Out of all the subjects, my science got the highest! (41 / 48) It was the best subject I have done well this time, but actually, the test only consist of two chapters (electricity and sound). Just hope to do better in the coming final year exams.   My piano practical exams are approaching! About One week after the holidays. Will I pass? I haven't even learnt my aural! I must work hard in the remaining time I had left, especially my piano pieces and scales. Will a miracle happen?    A choir camp is coming up next tuesday! I just hope it'll eventually turn out to be a successful one. This is my first time ever helping in organising a camp. Although we didn't manage to stay overnight, we could just make use of one day to play and play!   Holidays are coming, but after I know what is going to happen right after, my thoughts of dreamland and whatever are gone. Four weeks, exactly four weeks after the Term 3 holidays will be final year exams. There will be rushing of lessons eventually and tons of remedials. Will I be able to catch up? I'm really worried. So scared that I might not do well for the next round of challege, a more important and challeging test of the year.   I've got piano practical test coming up! I'm afraid, I'm so afraid that I couldn't even score a pass for it. A pass is really sufficient for me. I really really hope to do well for it, as well as my final year exams. I want to enter the triple science class...  One more day to holidays, and with a wink of an eye, a week will soon be over very soon. Will I cope with the sudden rush? I must really urge myself to buck up, really...

        15 October 2003   The sound of raindrops could be heard, while I woke up to a world of reality - to which when I checked and asked for the actual time. My heart leaped. I was ONLY about 15 minutes from my actual report time -- 7.45. As I was rushing, my mother handed me a sum of money to board a cab.   I finally arrived in the chapel at 8.10 -- Five minutes earlier before the latest time(8.15) given by Pastor Wee. Lucky me! I quickly settled down beside my choir seniors before first talk by Pastor Wee begins.  What is a leader?   Someone who has a  vision , and is able to  influence  a  group of people  towards his vision.    We were grouped into various groups - Prudence, Steadfastness, Humility, Fairness, Trust and Integrity. Mine was Hot hot Humility! Mr Steven Wee was in charge of our group and Adeline was in the same group as me! I got to know...   -Maria(Gym), the only sec three girl in our group;  -Azimah, from library;  -Melissa, only sec one CO girl in our group;  -Jasmine(Student Councillor) -Phyllis(Band) The boys...  -Sufyan (NCC) -Shawn (IT media) -Chester (Leo Club)  Throughout these few days, I get to know more about the people in our group. Even the boys as they were very cooperative when it comes to doing things, and they're very automatic. Unlike the past groups I have had in class, they help us girls a lot to them.   Having to group with them was the most fortunate thing to do (out of the whole camp), and I had never regretted it. Some of the times, I would feel very left out, for doing the least things. Thus, I would try to do whatever I can be done to be part of a helper. It's really unforgetable experience...   Law Of Navigation (By. Pastor Goh)   Anyone Can Steer the Ship, but it Takes a Leader to Chart the Course  In this workshop, it talks about the vision that a leader has. Vision can be anything! A dream, or a target in which one has set into his life. To make the vision better, Navigators(leaders) got to plan the trip ahead and draw from experience. Navigators had also got to listen to opinions and examine the conditions before making commitments.    Law Of Connection (By. Pastor Wee)    Leaders Touch a Heart Before They Ask for a Hand  Through this workshop, it has really taught us the correct way of leading people. Many leaders had demanded their people to do something, however, they had not touched the hearts of each individual under them. This part of law is really important, as the stronger the relationship and connection between individuals, the more likely the follower will want to help the leader. It has really been the most pressing law throughout all the five laws that I've learnt during the camp.  Lunch was quite similar to what I have during choir camp. Food was available in packets and drinks were offered in plastic cups provided by the church. Some might wonder: "Do we need to pay money for it?" Ans: "No! The school had pay entirely just for the sake of training the future student leaders."  Two experimential sharing was held right after the lunch by Maj Leow and Maj David Tan respectively. What had inspired me most, was Maj David's childhood dream. He had dreamed of flying the world most biggest Singapore state flag during the national day, and it had finally became true during 1996.   To be Continued...

        Happy Halloween!  I'm not sure if halloween is over, but if anybody did watch "Nightmare Before Christmas" before, you'll  know what's the midi music in my guestbook. "This is Halloween!"  School Day today! Instead of having my normal lessons, we went to the science centre! Talking about Science Centre, it really changed a lot. There were new exhibits and interesting stuffs.   We first watched a short movie clip about heredity in the lecture hall, which was big and spacious enough to fit three classes - mine, 2 endurance and 2 devotion. We saw the same instructor that we met during the 2002 Young Scientist Fair!   Basically, the movie clip talked about how genes are passed out to us from our parents, number of chromosomes in our body, and what different type of genes are recessive or dominant. I've also learn about how identical twins are formed!   After that, we were brought throught the biotechnology  exhibit and given worksheets to do. After doing it for quite sometimes, we finally gave up and decided to spend our rest of the day at Mcdonalds. We were so famished!   The trip back to school made us so weary. Back to our classroom, all of us had to rest our heads on the table. The trip back home had really made me so worried - We are going to receive all our results tomorrow...  Somehow, this news had really made me feel tense up. I've been worried for days and days now, and how will my results turn out? A simple thought of it would even bring me sleepless nights. Why can't I stop having this feeling?   What can I do? Is praying the only way out? I try and tried to be optimistic, but it sometimes changes or turns out to be another way. I'm really seeking and praying, hopefully, for a miracle that would overcome my fears, my thoughts..

        I'm back after a week of tense composure!  All my important exams had passed, and now, two days of break before going on for another two days.   Life without computer was "tough". Time and to time, I've resist my temptation of not going online. And I did it! Not going online for the whole for one week. Through all five days of the week, I've stayed at the same room, same place right after I reached home. In fact, I've sleep at 12 o'clock almost every night.   Some subjects were really tough for me, while some due to carelessness and slowness. I really have no confidence in some my subjects, and getting back my position I achieved last year. At least, I have hoped for my science and maths, but I'm doubting if whether I can score well for it.   Home Econs- The greatest carelessness for home economics. Could you imagine, sitting there for almost 20 minutes, and not knowing that you have not completed the last three pages until the last 2 minutes? Using the rest of the time, I tried rushing through my third last page. I never really did finish it, but I've least answered some. The rest of the two pages were totally blank when the time was up.   I've almost cried. Imagine spending the previous day til 12am, trying the memorise all the things necessary. A stupid mistake to make. Really stupid one.   History- Source-based questions were tough, as well as essay questions. I've spend most of the time doing the SBQ, and end up rushing through the essay questions. In the end, my last questions was not quite entirely complete.   Literature-  The paper was quite average. However, I've spend the last 15 minutes, trying to complete my last essay question about "He who says No". I simply couldn't think of something perfect to answer. In fact, even though the paper was up, I was still rushing. Miss Yoges who was collecting the paper, grabbed my hand and pulled the paper away from me. I almost felt like crying. For the first time, a teacher grab my hand to stop me from writing. I was horrified.   Chinese-  Paper 2 was quite average while paper 1 was quite hard. I've tried to write about a problem I've faced but I seemed not according to what the paper wants. Can I score well for it?   Fear and Panic seemed to aroused for all my papers. Will I score well? The only things I could do now, was to do well for my coming papers, and pray for a miracle. Will my miracle happen? Simply no one knows.     deoxyribonucleic acid! ;)

      I'm drowsy and weary.. especially a day of walk after our performance rehersal. And now, my legs are aching like an old lady. It's my first time performing outdoors as a school! Despite being to the conference hall for so many times, I get to have a larger glance of the stage over there..   "Lead us to a place,   Guide us with your grace,   To a place where we'll be save."  Anyone knows this song? Bingo! The Prayer by Charlotte Church and Josh Groban.. The two most favourite vocalists of mine, which happen to sing in the same particular song!(Well actually, I only knew a little famous vocalists)  Same goes to yang hui and yang kai! I've always wanted to be like them.. and they sang so well!   It really takes effort and patience to get what you want. But what is the thing that really interest me? If you happen ask me about my ambition, it would certainly take me a whole day for answering that particular question.   I don't really care about ambitions while I was merely less than 8. Maybe I simply don't even know about it! Until one particular time, while I was starting to learn about planets in school , then it captures my interest. Perhaps of being an astronomer? Or a scientist.   During primary five, the first year in my new primary school, we were practising "Any dream will do" and "When we hold on together" on the teacher's day. That was the time, I realised the singing voice within me, after what my form teacher told me. I never really had the chance to sing oftenly during primary school, and I knew little songs.   When it comes to choosing of ccas during secondary one, I had no intention of joining choir..until, I saw the performance of "Sing Out" and the singing of "Any Dream Will Do"! My choice was set after being attracted to it. And ever since then, I thought of being vocalists, choral instructor.. Even a chemist after learning about protons, neutrons and electrons during secondary two.   You know what is the most unlikely occupation I will have?  Surgeon & Forensic Scientist Maybe I'm just not suitable to cutting open 'live' objects.   The future of me is just so unpredictable..    Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas!

      Christmas Day finally! You know what that means? 7 days to school. It's hard for me to believe it.. but I guess after weeks of resting, I've lost track of days. What on earth is happening with me?!  How I wish I could celebrate christmas! People are having such a joyous occasion, sharing and opening their presents. Will I ever get to be part of the fun? Hopefully someday, I will. And the bestest present to receive.. is to feel the touch of real snow, and to experience winter.   There's a rehersal for the concert tomorrow, which gives me such a gleeful mood that I'm looking forward to. A "christmas present" which cheers me up before another challenging year begins. I've received other christmas presents though! Cards and ecards..and I really appreciated people who send it!   May the Christmas spirits be with everyone this season. Merry Christmas!

      It's Christmas tommorrow!   I can't hardly believe it. Throughout the week, I've been hovering thoughts about sending own made x'mas cards to everyone I know, until now, I've only just realized that christmas is just tomorrow. How forgetful I must have been nowadays.. But I hope pple do receive my ecards out there! If not, click this link below!   Merry Christmas!   My school performance is just 6 days away at Singapore Conference Hall. Just hope my uncle happens to be working that day! My mother and brothers are coming to watch me perform, and everything is going be so exciting. A big outdoor concert!   My special day's coming! I'm don't anticipated much presents for me though after many years of my birthdays. Not much people will know it. I'm turning fifTEEN! 4 more TEEN years before adult. I'm hoping for a non-stressful year at this particular age! Where challenges are set there for me. Tasks to accomplish, and visions to set for. What I hope for, is to be optimistic and calm all the time through challenges, difficulties. Never give up no matter what happens.   That's all.. Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas!   Tigger jumps!

      Two months had passed. In fact, the sudden break down of my internet helped me with my cutting of habit. Throughout the past few days of the month, I really take up a lot of useful habits. Reading, playing the piano.   Several things happened through the month. The 2nd ever recording I've been to, my leadership camp, adventure camp, as well as my recent choir camp.. Just so many things to pour out from my mind.   Am I going to cope with the pressure next year? Thousands of thoughts had came across my mind. The nine main subjects to cope with, my cca, and other things I will see to next year. Panic reigning around my worries, my thoughts. I pray for a friend, and true friend who is willingly to reach out the greatful hand of hers to help me up with comfort, encouragement and support. To pull me through hard and difficult times.    I never really had a very close friend ever since I enter secondary school. Ever if I really have them, some of them too have their own friends who they usually spend more time with. I need a friend who's able to listen to my thoughts, my sorrows.. just anything which a trustworthy friend can keep instead of myself. Am I ever gonna meet one?   Friends we know now, and even in the future.. People will never know, that someday, we'll forget them and met new ones. People we know now will just become part of our little memories that will fade easily.     Choir    In a few weeks time, everything will change. How am I going to handle the new batch that's coming in? Without the help of the last sectional leader, I'm going to cope with both my studies, choir, and other things. The thought of it even makes me panic. I just hated such stressful life.   "I'm gonna make my section do better next time." But how? Hidden are many talents that can sing, and even do other things that we don't expect. Each time our conductor says that the section is soft, I just told myself.. someday, I'm gonna make them realize, we're actually better than what we are. Will I ever succeed? I just pray that someday, people will understand my intentions, my feelings and thoughts being a sectional leader.   My cca is part of the place where my heart belongs. In every practice I attend, it's just the most joyous time, where I can let go of my sorrows, my worries. Somehow, I felt myself linked to it. Losing it, means losing one of your love ones. But eventually, it'll become part of my memory in future.

      Things just changed so much. Not much presence of fun, especially changes the school had made. 3 Devotion! Another phase to be remembered in my mind. But what's in my mind is still fresh -- 2 Faith. The memories I had during my lower sec years. Unforgetable ones.   Friends are important in each and every person's life. They help and pulls you up while you're down. But as time passed, the ties will just lengthened and break. Whether a not, we'll always cherish them always.   Homework on the first week! And sick too.. But somehow, I got to get use to the idea now. Better not be lazy!   We had an english teacher as our form teacher! He's quite funny too, and my new class is so far good. Science lessons too! We had Mr Chandra as our Biology teacher, Mrs Andrew for chemistry, and Mr Tan for Physics. So far..I like my biology lessons! Both of our maths were taken by Miss Tang! Although she might be strict, we still manage to learn much from her.   Our first choir practice of the year! We practised "Sing Out" as one of our cca performance, and sang teddy bears' picnic. Everything just changed so much. It just brings me back to the past years. My Sec One Open House, how I got attracted to choir, and my SYF days.   3 more days! I guess it's just gonna be a same one as usual. Nothing much.. but I hope I'll able to be a better person in future! Thanks for the candies..brother! Although he can't see it here, but he actually gotten scoldings from my mother. This year, I'm giving him a better one.. I will. Although he can be mischievous at times, he actually is quite different sometimes. I hope he'll always be the same brother I've seen now.

      It's first day of school today. A day to discover new happenings, and things to learn. I began to find myself smile blissfully as I paced towards my classmates. Some are no longer my classmates anymore...  Things go on as time passes without us knowing. After looking back into the past, you'll then realise how much changes have taken place. Things change. So do people.   It's my birthday soon! 11 days.. and very soon, I'll be getting my new IC. Somehow, I felt weird after what my mother's told me. "Grown up girl already lor"   I don't wish much for my birthday.. but I just hope that, I'll be just as contented without having stress throughout the year.    My wishlist! -Disney Classics -Charlotte Church -Josh Groban -Andrew Loyd Webber (wrong spelling)  -Forbidden City!  -Anything that's nice  -and meaningful..   That's all.. rmr to read my previous entry!!

      The time now is 5.30. Exactly 7.5 hours to a brand new year! Yesterday's concert was just successful. There goes another event to mark in this special year.   As we look back into the days, or even months, there simply so many events to reflect. As people look back through the years, there's usually significant events to represent that particular year you have in your mind. Mine is no exception.. how about yours?! Here goes my summary of my year...   The first month usually marks the beginning of things. A month in which I start my secondary two life, and learn things that we're supposed to learn. So goes my birthday! I was the first time that I've received the most presents from my friends. I was really glad my birthday was not forgotten, for it usually was..     February.. It was the first time to celebrate chinese new year at my form teacher's house, Mr Soon! Our first class gathering of the year.  Same goes for my first love, after all the crushes and stuff. I learn what's love and how the taste or feeling is like. My first valentine present too! And really thanks to it, I started this journal. Everything just changed so much looking back now.  There may be happy times, but there are also sad times. Friends should always learn to help each other when they are in need. They should never be taken for granted. That was a mistake I make, which I kept and learn from it.     March As the footsteps of syf was drawing near (which it didn't), we practice at victoria concert hall the first round, which happens to be one of my friends' birthday. Singing there was great, but Sars came and drag it til July. We sang at Nanyang Girls' auditorium instead. Everything was happening exactly on the same day! I managed to catch a vocal concert at Esplanade the first time too.  My first seen musical was on the same week at ACS Barker, untitled "Exodus".  Choir Workshop at HIHS! It has really taught me how to sing in a choir competition. The workshop was useful after all. However, schools were closed due to SARS for weeks til april..      April School finally reopened, but there were temperture checkings everywhere! Although syf performance was postponed suddenly, I was glad that we had actually much more time to prepared for it. Two of my friend's birthday was on the same month! But I was really guilty for not giving them any presents. We were hardly together though. Hopefully I can make it up on their next coming birthdays.  I was assigned as an asst. sectional leader for sopranos and librarian in choir commitee! I never been a leader much, but after being just an assistant, I realise the pressure they may face. But I must learn the cope with it as time passed though.  I had my first sectionals with the batch of sec ones in syf competition. It was really fun teaching them, although I may be mixed up with my counting of beats regularly.    Mid year exams in May. The sound of it really makes people is so serious. I spent lots and lots of time studying it.. and I realise how lucky I manage to get my position last year. People behind me can actually do better than me if they have work more harder. How lucky I must have been to be in 4th position.  Singing the wedding choir was really fun! Despite being a non-christian, I could actually seen how a church wedding was like.     Choosing of Subject Combination was right before the June holidays. I had a hard time making the right choice, but I've finally made up my decision.  I went to winnie's concert too!  There were thanksgiving practices as well as syf practices during the holidays. So do holiday assignments. Although I still had to go to school, it's really much better than to spend my holidays at home.    July marks one of the most memorable events for choir. We obtained silver in SYF Central Judging Competition! Most of us shed tears of happiness..the most happy feeling I ever had. It was really a miracle, and somehow, the best pride of something I had through the years.   Thanksgiving was also included! But I just felt disappointed for not being able to dance this year. We sang love in any language and any dream will do anyway! Mega project! After spending hours and hours, I finally sold my very own art piece..the shirt! There comes a feeling of great sastisfaction.    A farewell function was held for the 4Es and 5Ns during august. I managed the learn "Sing Out" while the alto practise their item! But what I planned isn't great. We sang songs(sign~)..Maybe we could dance like altos too. And the guys were great too! They said the rap on "dan chao fan"..I'm really gonna miss the ensemble. If they could sing just one last song..     September was another month of fun! I cycle with my friends at bishan park and even learn to blade. But I didn't really succeed though. :) Teacher's day wasn't really a nice one. My friends and I were chased out of our primary school! But what I'm glad was that, we were able meet each other once again.  I watch my second musical too.. Forbidden City @ Esplanade. I was glad I never miss it too!  The choir sang the school song when the acting minister of education came. It's was only hours before my grade 6 piano practical! It really wasn't a great one though, but I did manage to pass.  Choir camp! It wasn't really a great one, but people still had fun from it.     October was a month of pressure. The composure was tense everywhere and people are just concentrating on their books and revising. The most important of my year. I've slept at 12 almost everyday too. But I was glad it was over!  I learnt many things about leading during the leadership camp held right after exams.  Although it's the toughest camp I've ever been to, I was glad that I was able to learn much from it.     I had my sec two promotion camp during the first few days of November. I got to the first class! Through the camp days, I get to know more about the new classmates too. We had fun climbing and playing at the camp..  There's still choir practices during the holidays! We practice songs as well as the dance we're having for the PHatasy contest during december. Another recording to made! And this time, it's the song "I'm gonna travel".     The second choir camp during december! It was much much better than the previous one held.. and instead of one day, it's 3D and 2N. The camp was a fun and nice one overall. We played the game "Contact" through the second night, and it was so fun! Finally the PHatasy concert! Everything was a success last night..isn't it? Although we didn't perform quite well.     Just so many things that I've encountered! But what's most important, is that to learn from the mistakes you've made, and remember all the happy times you have! Happy New Year to all!

      Sometimes, songs really signify varies parts of one's life. Wondering what song was that you heard?  'If We Hold On Together'  By just looking at the words of the song, it just sort of give me comfort now. I must go on.   Times fly fast. Just look at me now..it seems just yesterday that I entered this school, joined choir and so on. It seemed that I just got my PSLE score, studied in my new primary school and so on. But look at me now! It's been 2 years and a few months past down my life line. And yet I was thinking of the past.   I really felt myself slumping down onto the chair and break off just like that today. Really heart broken - flabbergasted. I became the only failure in class. It doesn't really matter much to me if someone fails too.. But just look - I'm the only one. Never daring to take a look at my marks - it just makes me more depress, dejected.   But I held on. I don't know if doing this was right. Maybe bottling up feelings isn't good.. but why cry if you could haven't done your best out of it? It didn't worth it.. I must give myself a greater push. Something to like what yang hui said during the last year's syf sectional practice. One don't deserved to cry if one didn't make effort to do it. It did really make sense a lot to me.   Everything just got better as I proceed home. I was glancing at somewhat a nice tree with pinks flowers all over as I walk home. Really stupid of me, but I just felt  that it gave me comfort whenever I felt sad as I walked home from my station.   I must learn to adapt and work harder..  O levels released today! The highest got nine marks.. 7 A1s and 1 B3 (Chinese). It was really terrible when I saw what he got for english.. A1. The others were followed by 2 with 6 A1s and and so on. It was really unexpectable. How do they achieve such results? Hardwork, skills, help from friends, comfort, advice.. so much more.. Will I be able to do it? Will it be my turn next time? No one can predict it, neither do I.     *Don't lose your way*     *With each passing day*     *You've come so far*     *Don't throw it away*...

      Common test. Sounds so common, but totally different from inside. Really tough, almost draining all your efforts just for it. So tough.  Maybe it's just the first ever encounter for me this year. Many things to cope with, and goals which are yet to be accomplished by me. Not that I can't, but I just too lazy to do it.   English - the weakest subject always. No matter how I tried to do my best out of it, it's still the weakest of all. Will I be ever do well in it? Sometimes, it really takes people to ask themselves, 'What can they do to achieve the best out of it?' If I could just find out.  As usual, it was the common red mark I saw today. The bad omen, one that brings you down to a state of depression. A heart breaker, one that brings tears out of you. Tears were almost brought out of me.   I was feeling bad about it. I really should deserve the results I got now. I really isn't working hard enough. Really not. Looking at my marks, I knew I could do better. Why am I not making my best out of it?   'Buck up! Pull up your socks!' These were thoughts as I watch my english teacher, trying his best to give me additional marks to pass. It was really  thoughtful of him. Looking at his expression, I knew he was trying hard to help me up. It was really idiotic of me..'I should have done the best out of it, I should have'  Two more tests to go. I really must be doing the best out of it.     *Don't lose your way*     *With each passing day*     *You've come so far*     *Don't throw it away*...

      Another week of tight schedule, but I was able to get loosen up a little before the common test approaches. Tired indeed. There were lesser homeworks due to that too.   My English Paper was yesterday. Can't doubt if I can do well, but I just hope that would not find myself in the weekly's english remedial. My weakest subject always.   Something really unexpected happened though. My commonwealth compo assignment got selected as one of entries for competition. Amazed right? I never expect that I would write well as compared to one of my choir juniors. Never. No matter how I try, mine would never score high. My only best entry.   There were four of them, three who were really great in english, except for me. I'm so afraid though, perhaps it's really luck which help me. Or maybe my prayer worked.  That compo was really a lot of time spent, the only compo I worked longest upon. Will I sustain such results during my tests? Hopefully..   Chemistry was today. I did the almost last minute revision though..really risky. To my relief, all topics were mostly revised through my lower secondary sciences. Hope I can score! But I guess don't.. (Being optimistic)  Here's part of my compo!   Around the Corner…  A soft, somewhat soothing sound came from a distance to where I was. What could it be? The tides were tremendous; they hit the shores forcefully, with splashing waters running up to my ankles. “Splish, splash…” Waves came to and fro, lasting throughout eternity, and hitting to the unceasing rhythm. Still and yet alluring, the whistling sound stayed dangling, luring people to which it seemed to be doing. “Splish, splash…” Blue waters rose and fell continuously, creating wonderful pieces of art work.  ‘Perhaps I’m just imagining.’ I thought, wondering off listlessly without any further ado. ‘How captivating indeed…’  It did not last long. Ominous black clouds gathered across the horizon, engulfing the once gaping scenery. The bad omen was visibly approaching. In the next moment, the tidal waves were moving relentlessly, creating a greater impact on a much higher ground. I glanced in all directions hurriedly, hoping for a place to shelter. Just then, there was something which caught my attention – a cave at the cliff. Without further hesitation, I scrambled desperately towards it, grabbing my shoes along.  Luck was not on my side. As drops of rain landed heavily on me, it slipped through my clothing, sending chills down my spine. Gritting my teeth, I nudged my way through the downpour, aching to reach the cave any minute. The view was fuzzy and barely clear, with the grains of wet sand fiddling with my bare soles. Is there really a cave? Millions of thoughts went pass my mind.   Despite the hitting of rain drops on the ground, the whistling sound goes on endlessly, pressing me to go on. It seemed to give me hope, pulling me through the worries I had.  “You’ll be there around the corner,” It whistled to me. “Carry on!” It was an ‘encouragement’ that urged me to go on. As I proceeded further, I recited the verse solemnly in my mind. In a moment, I spotted a glimmer of light, glowing luminously despite the heavy pour of water from the sky. Was it an illusion that I had?  The whistling grew louder as I went nearer it…   	 Only part of the story is posted.. haha That's all!   Song featuring.. If We Hold On Together.. On your speakers loud! :P     *May The Music Never End, Surround Us With A Circle Of Love*      Read My Guestbook!  |  Sign My Guestbook!

       Dragon Lady     Now will they understand I have been waiting for so long To see the day the world will see What I have seen,  Lord, let them see clearly Now they will know the face that I have know, Reaching through the years,  Will they feel the same way,  Will they know her now? This day I'll know  If I called her, If I brought her life time  From the shadows of the past  To the light    The above lyrics are taken from the song from the musical, forbidden city that I've watched. Spent time listening and figuring out the the first verse of the song. One of my favourite songs from this musical. It just happens to pop out in my mind as I gone back today - feeling remoted and drowsy to the sleepless days I had.   Life was just like what people who thought. Having the entire weekdays being occupied. Have I manage my time well enough? I just don't know. Pressure's already passing down on me.   Been a hard starting for me. Tons of homeworks to be done, with tests at the same time. Tired indeed. Why are so many things to worry about? Matters over matters, thoughts over thoughts, worries over worries.   Things are so hard nowadays. Exams coming up too.. another period of sleeplessness. Not going to online after and of exams.

      1 February About two weeks since I've not update my entry. Time pass quite quickly indeed, isn't it? I've had a busy beginning. Quite busy one.   My life this year begin just quite different. Just the beginning of term one, and I've yet so much work to complete everyday. A life of triple science student? Maybe.   Several comments from my seniors. Some said life was hard, some said stressful. Several advices, and now, I'm hovering thoughts of what might my future be like. Hopefully not like theirs. But no matter what, I'll just live the best i can, overcoming all that I can overcome.   Changes are clearly seem throughout the times. Why are there always changes? Maybe life just have to goes on some day. The friends you had, your habits, as well as your everyday life just have to go through changes.   I'm back to my old friends again. Jubilant, I tried my best to be aware of myself. I tried not to be selfish, and to speak up most of the times.  I hope a better self.  Nevertheless, I shall not commit my same mistakes.   Just an election been held recently. Congrants! Every thing just came so fast.. and just a couple of months time, they'll be leaving. How are things going to be like? Perhaps people will just have to go on, and part some day. Shedding of tears involved. Shades of blue everywhere, signs of melancholy.   Another year of disaster? I pray for blessings, to people who needs help and listening ears. I pray for a better life, that my friends will be well, as well as a peaceful year. Will my prayers be granted?   13 January I'm 15 finally! Although it's a bit late in updating my entry now... Thanks for all the presents! One of the best of the best birthdays I had, which is specially on a choir practice day. The only birthday with a choir practice.  May people out there have such birthdays too. An ideal birthday they would want to have. Happy 15th to me again!

        Read My Guestbook!  |  Sign My Guestbook!   Pardon me for my laziness, for it's been weeks since I've updated it anyway. It's been the second week of 2nd school term!   I finally found time for rest during the holidays. Although it's really not much of it, I was really glad that I'm able to grab hold of my holiday time well. (Of course not so well)  Three day courses to attend. What for? That's the time when I had fun! Together with a few of my choir pals, we went learning dance steps for the SYF* Opening Ceremony. (Singapore Youth Festival)   Choir finally can dance again! Yipee.. starting to like it anyway. Hey.. don't think I'm mad ok? Although steps are not really of most people's likeness.. I still enjoy it anyway. New friends make and so for.. Can't wait to go for another!   So does our school's musical!   Update someday.. c ya again!

      A emotional week. Panic, shades of melancholy, and  now moments of ecstasy. Not really sastisfied with my results though. But I really thanked all who encouraged me and the ones above which answered my prayers.   Can't believe I actually prayed to God, despite belonging to another religion.  But I really did it. All this while I actually pray.. to ask for wisdom, self-confidence and many other things.   I suffered three big blows which came directly and straight at me. First the English test, next the Physics test, and followed by Geography. Two E8s and one F9. Just imagine.. if I were to get such kind of results during 'O' level, it's gonna be the worst thing i encountered in my entire life.   I just suddenly broke off in tears silently on the third paper received. I tried tolerating at first, but no use.. "Just work harder in future will do". But just as I look at my Geography paper, I just felt that I such an idiot. It used to be my best paper.. and now, all my efforts were all down the bin.   I hadn't managed my time well. Such a slow writer am I? All my friends managed to finish the papers, and me? With two more questions waiting for me to complete, yet I'm uncapable of doing so. 6-8 marks questions. It kills me entirely.   "I've finally passed!" "Thank you, God, Thank you!"   These were numerous thoughts on my head when I received my maths paper. A1 for maths and chemistry, A2 for social studies, amd B3 for A maths and chinese. Wasn't crying any more..   Just one subject left - Biology. How will my marks be like? Panick-sticken, I made my way back home as quick as possible today, to glimpse at my marks. Just hoping for the best.. The marks still weren't out though.   Perhaps people will have to be optimistic, and be confident in the things you do. Thinking on the bad side isn't going to help you up. Instead, it pulls you down.  Always look on the brightest side of life.   I found a Korea Tv series drama song! You can't say.. Hope you enjoy it! (even though it's imcompleted)  That's all, enjoy the song!

      Almost everything change.   Just like people,  Children when they were young,  Pure and Innocent.  As times went by,  People go on.  Changes you discover.   Why?   People tend to make changes as they grow. Just look back at what time did. Were things the same as before? No.  Sometimes, changes of people make us feel remorse about it. Especially changes in their conduct.   People once close to you weren't as close as before. But people weren't close to you are close to you now. Sometimes, even friends can turn enemies, whereas enemies can turn friends. Weird changes, but it happened.  (I'm not writing this to hurt anyone, hope this doesn't brings misunderstandings between my friends now)  Life..   Just finished the syf dance practice recently. Although our teacher told us to finish by that particular day, the leaders failed though (girls). Sometimes, I just felt so tensed up. Why can't just people do their part by learning? Despite several reminders, mistakes still occur. That's when accuses came upon us. Can't people spare a thought for people like us? Learn to spare a thought for your teachers too.   People still talk despite reminders. You know what I heard? People were igornant, SOME people, really angered me when they mention. "Ai yah, dunno lar, later one of the leaders can self tutor one mah."  All I felt were disappointment, with efforts being thrown down the trash. I've been very tolerant of them. Changed people who weren't behaving like that before.   Just hope that things will eventually goes better.         The Classic IQ Test     Congratulations, Yi Tian!

        Read My Guestbook!  |  Sign My Guestbook!    Sometimes i wonder, even people do.   Why we do have different views of time on different circumstances we faced? Sometimes, people just felt that time is just too fast for them to cope with. Some felt that time is just going at a very slow pace. But why?   Days ago, or earlier on, I've received chain letters defining the value of time. Take a look at this...   To realize The value of ten years: Ask a newly Divorced couple.  To realize The value of four years: Ask a graduate.  To realize The value of one year: Ask a student who Has failed a final exam.  To realize The value of nine months: Ask a mother who gave birth to a still born.  To realize The value of one month: Ask a mother who has given birth to A premature baby.  To realize The value of one week: Ask an editor of a weekly newspaper.  To realize The value of one hour: Ask the lovers who are waiting to Meet.  To realize The value of one minute: Ask a person Who has missed the train, bus or plane.  To realize The value of one-second: Ask a person Who has survived an accident...  To realize The value of one millisecond: Ask the person who has won a silver medal in the Olympics  Time waits for no one.    Although it's just a chain letter, but what I learn from it is really meaningful - the value of time. Have you ever take time for granted? I certainly did. Months since the start of school term, I've tried managing time in a proper way.. but habits seemed to put me out of it. Bad ones. There were times I was lazy, as well as times when I was unawared time that was not spent in a proper manner.   My habit of going online frequently just couldn't be resolved.. (except for this couple of days). Temptations.. things that simply just distract you from doing the things you want. Perhaps situations are improving, maybe not.   Exams in just a few weeks' time. "Mid-year exams", The sound of it sort of makes me fearful of the harder challeages I am going to face. Worktime in the next couple weeks. The value of time. Can I do it?  My labours would have to come from the number of efforts put it...

      It's a free week! Pretty glad about it though.. it's just like, there's finally a week of break for me. Free from all the times of intense work.   If it can last just as long as the june holidays..  OC WEEK! Opening Ceremony.. There's full dress rehearsal tomorrow, preview from outsiders.. hopefully my mum would come along with my little brother. My friends seem to mention lots about OC too.. OC as in Orange County (a show).  Butterflies in my stomach. Just can't imagine I'm realy going to sing again.. thoughts of it just make me feel jumpy about it.   It was a tedious one last week, with two language papers to cope with and music mid-year. Pray hard that I would pass.. mm, perhaps just having faith in what I did. Everything is just so.. tough.   A typical singaporean. Sometimes.. I just envy those people of other country. Unlike us, we're just so caught up with many things at one time. Not much time for leisure. So many singaporeans.. and I'm one of them. Erm.. not saying that I don't like singapore. I'm glad being one of them.   June holidays are just a stone throw away.. three weeks left, but what's the use? Things is going to be the same always.. I'll rather have all the exams before it, but with s second thought, it does benefit us after all. More time to prepare.. but I'm not the sort! Just hope to make full use of it eventually.   Good luck for OC!   Finally found a music piano sheet I want.. Ever heard of Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca? It was years ago since I stumbled upon this song.. and it's been dangling in my head all the while! But it's so fast.. so difficult too. Just hope I'll manage to play it well!

      I'm back finally! Back from the fun I had in the national stadium. SYFOC! I should say.. it's really the most enjoyable event to participate in, despite that hot, blazing sun, having to follow the instructor all times.  Paaduvom.. Really gives me the feeling of dancing that song again and again. "Flap your wings.." Perhaps that isn't such a funny step after all. Thanks to Mr Gn's demonstration, the steps are much less funnier. Actually, I like the steps once I learn it. "CoRourful, powderful.."  One last rehearsal before the actual one, but the sec three are excused from that. School exams! Pure chemistry and additional mathematics on thursday. Why just can't exams be held before the holidays? But despite all that, I've never regret in joining syf! The last year to enjoy before GCE comes.   I'm sure going to miss SYF! Perhaps the humorous Mr Gn too that dazed so many people? [I admit that he's good looking too :P] And it's sure to be one of the most niciest memories in choir.   But work still got to come first. Three more days til exams.. and I'm still playing a fool here. Pray that I'll "survived" this time.. and it's been really tough, having to balance between homework and play time.  That's all for the month! SYF this saturday, and I'll be treating it as an end to all that extreme work the coming week. Work time for me now on til saturaday! I hate studying.. but I fear failing too.. argh!  I'll be back writing more..   [Paaduvom? rmr to flap your wings ok? :P]  Yi Tian

      Terrible>   Tons of maths assignment, 1000 words compo, complaint letter practice, film review, 250 chinese idioms? , 5 250-words chinese reports, projects, researchs. How about extra lessons? Let's define.. sleeplessness? Illness causes due to lack of sleep. Lack of sleep due to the above mentioned.   Holidays just started! Shouts of joy.. how about something relaxing? TADA! A table of homework. R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S. Perhaps there'll never be a day to restrain from them - HOMEWORKS. A new style of life.. perhaps?   SYFOC was fun, fun.. and FUN! A year of opening ceremonies.. and I'm going through the best ever. Sort of a bigger event as compared to our school's. Let's see, a 9 hundred over choir, singing and dancing at the same time.   Just been through two combined practices. There's Miss Faith, Mr Gn! Somehow.. We enjoy their teachings a lot. "Move your drumsticks to the left!" .." Colourfuull! Powderfull!". It's been long since I felt excited about certain things. "A superhero!"    Harry Potter's out! Heard that it's be directed by a different person this time. Just hope to catch it soon! Expecto Patronum!

      It’s been a week since the syf opening ceremony… Time passes real fast right? Seemed moments ago, I was singing and dancing at the national stadium. “Varuka varukaem...”  Really going to miss syf much!   3rd July, Saturday   People were stealing curious glances of me. Somehow, I made a fool out of myself while heading to school by train – wearing white all over. White shirt, white pants, white shoes… but nevertheless, my mood stayed set for the day coming ahead of me. Excitement! ‘Everything is going to be all right…’   Felt relieved after meeting tanya and shang yi... the three mad patients from IMH? Finally met the rest of my friends at the canteen, where most of the “mad” people were.  I brought a camera along for picture taking! Really had a tough time after that, stuffing all those crops in our big pockets.   My mind sort of went bonkers after boarding on the bus. I misplaced my hat! Actually, it’s been kept all along in my bag. But my mood still remains for the coming event ahead… On bus, we “sang” through the songs and actions [seated down, of course]. Kept doing Paaduvom again and again, and just simply doesn’t get tired of it at all.   At National Stadium, Mrs Wong took shots of us before entering. Even brought mine for a couple of shots too… When we’ve finally settled down, we spent our time gazing at lim jiuan’s outfit, trying to figure out where our school sits. Our performance started, with our spirits hanging high. Reach! Still remember those fun moments while dancing through the songs.   Everything seemed to be going well until the sky turned grey with clouds… My feelings were kind of like being dragged down like that, suddenly praying to God in a desperate manner. Thank the Mighty God who gives us miracles! The rain finally shimmered down in a few minutes. Those moments will never be forgotten, those fun times…   We’ve manage to take one shot with Peter Gn – one precious shot, still being undeveloped in my camera! But we’ve been quite satisfied with that… finally left the national stadium when I regretted not taking shots with lim jiuan. Things shall now be part of my memory.   Thank God who make everything possible.      Paaduvom Vaarungal! :D

      Excitment simply describes my feelings now.. perhaps nervousness too? I'm just feeling like somehow, a person standing on the top of the world. Many good things happening at the same time.   [Singapore Youth Festival Opening Ceremony 2004] Long-winded me.. But it doesn't matter much to me anymore, neither do I care about what people think of that now.   It's the final, actual day tomorrow! But I'm growing madder however, especially in class with tanya and yvonne today. We're syf freaks! Free periods made up almost the entire day - right after our CME paper. All these times, we're singing and dancing paaduvom repeatedly.. then reach, followed by other songs..  Exams are finally over, and now fun time comes.. it's youth day!   High spirits and full of ecstasy. Everything seemed just so right today. I've finally got Mr Gn's mail! Actually, it's a mail to all the combine schools choir involved lar.. Below is the message from him to all people involved:    " By the time you read this, the Opening Ceremony would probably already be over.  But  this message I would like to share with all of you nonetheless. We're  all called to different things in life, but sometimes destiny has it in  her  cards that some people should meet. And I'm glad I met all of you. The  times we shared together may not have been all that many, but they are as  precious as they are unforgettable, and will remain so. The sessions at New  Town  Secondary  School, and the sessions with the students leaders at the CCA Branch Dance Studio will always be special to me. We had such great fun hip-hopping, and grooving to the SYF songs, all the way to the stadium. The  hours may be long, the muscles stretched and the skin parched from the sun,  but  through  it all, we pulled through.This performance, for many of you,  would not be the last. May you always keep the performing arts spirit alive  by  continuing  to  pursue  your dreams in this area, and scale even greater  heights.  I  wish  all of you well, and if along our journey, I've added  a  spark  of joy or exhilaration to your training sessions, then I'm happy. Also, if along the way, you were somehow inspired, then I count that a blessing too. Whatever it is, always keep your chins up high, and do your best  in  all  your  pursuits in life. Talent is nothing if it is not honed with discipline and hard work. Farewell, my friends ! "   I'll continue someday.. and good luck of SYFOC tomorrow! Remember to pray for good weather and performance :D.      Paaduvom Vaarungal! :D

Really kind of exciting right? And one more day to our school's celebration at Fort Canning Park. You guys believe it.. Creating a guiness world record, using flowers to make a large state flag? Homerun at Lido last year... better catch out for out in news that day... haha  I'm doing the first item of the day! Actually, Ian is doing it with me.. well, but anyway, singing National Anthem with the band? Mmm, although there's no objection from me, but hey, everyone knows how to sing right? At least the school song is not bad after all. But it's going to be my first time singing duet! The excitment is kind of like growing as the day approaches.  Doing syf dance on ndp.. yipee! but we'll have to do only four. After those long and hard consideration, it's reach, we can change the world, nian qing de he cai and paaduvom!!
