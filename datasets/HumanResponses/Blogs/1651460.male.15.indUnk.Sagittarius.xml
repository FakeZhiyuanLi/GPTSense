       I spent the night with Austin last night and I had a pretty good time, but let me give you a little background info. I talked to Al yesterday morning, and I kind of invited him over. As you know I went to Austin's, yeah I know big trouble. Anyways, Austin called and asked me if I wanted to spend the night, I kind of wanted to, sense he stays here a week then at his dad's for two. Then I called Al and said if he cared if I went over to Austin's. He got mad! I said he could come over if he wanted to and I tried to be nice, but he gets mad and hangs up. So I go to Austin's house. Now for today, I woke up at Austin's and my sister called and asked if I wanted to go on the boat with her and her friends. I went and had lots of fun. First we tried knee boarding, I hate it so. I tried five times and ended up just drinking lots of lake water. We tubed which is always fun, but Matt, Kat's friend, drove too fast. It scared me! He ended up going slower and I had a good time. So everyone just needs to hope that Al is happy with me again.

       I'll start with nothing special, sense nothing special happened. Yesterday, Kat went to the lake with her two friends (boys). I know, I thought she really did not need to go, but I have no say. Austin spent the night last night and we played games. So exciting (sarcasm)! I'm working on my website if you want to stop by and take a look. So until my next boring or perhaps interesting blog, so long.

       We went on our trip and it was fun. Nothing bad happened, except Al's zipper and button on his pants flew off. That was kinda funny. My mom was trying to drive my sister and her friend and she is an awful driver. Kat (my sister) said it almost killed her. I rode when she was driving and it scared me too. It was all fun and I think we all had a great time.

       My computer is here! I'm using it to blog right now. But before I go into details, I'll tell you about yesterday. I was in a bad mood to begin with. Then I go with my mom to get a barbecue. She says are you going to need some Acutaine, it's a prescription for acne. So I was mad, I go if you say that one more time I'm jumping out of this car. She leans over looks at me and says Acutaine, and guess what I jumped out. Then she came and picked me up. She was not to happy, and made me not play on the computer for the rest of the night. We got the boat fixed and we're going to try it again today, Al's coming so we will have fun... I hope.

       Last night my cousins spent the night. That was fun. Anyways on to the more important stuff, my computer will probably be here tomorrow. I know that because I looked at the tracking website. I'm excited! I did almost nothing today. Let me think.......yep nothing. Just to let you know that FedEx package I missed, they drove back by and I got it. It was the airport base station for the wireless internet. I need to buy one more part to make it work. I don't know where I'm going to get the ten bucks, but one things for sure not from mom!

       This morning was so very hectic. We'll I'm sleeping, and I here the phone and it rings and rings. So later I hear the door bell ring. I'm thinking what is happening! I get up go down the stairs and I see a FedEx paper on the door. Of course it's for my laptop and it says they'll be back tomorrow. Then I call mom and she says she has been calling because she has to work. I guess she didn't think she had to. I thought she was supposed to go to work. That was all interesting wasn't it. Now my cousins Emily and Erin are coming to swim. Just for the recap my sister is taking care of her friend's house while they're on vacation and they have a pool. So I'll probably have a good time.

       Well, I spent the night with Al last night. That was fun, we played Gamecube and Warcraft. The next day we tried to go to the lake, but the boat messed up. The funny thing is every time Al and I go places, something happens. When he went to Florida I got food poisoning, when we went to a cabin of my uncle's I hurt my foot, and so on and so on. Now he is going to spend the night with me tonight that will be fun. Tomorrow, it's official, I'm ordering my laptop. I'm very excited! Austin's back from vacation, he's still at his dad's house, but at least I can e-mail him now.

       My day has been pretty exciting. I took a shower, which may seem dumb at first but I had not taken one in three days. Some people may think thats gross, and it is. I got carried away with playing on my computer. I made my email address available at the top of my blog, that's a plus. My aunt, uncle, and cousin (the one I saw the movie with) came by. We ate watermelon and talked. My grandparents are spending the night, because my mom is working tonight. You would think a 14 (me) and 16 (sister) year old could handle themselves. My mom must think differently. I might end up at Al's house tonight. So it could not really matter much to me at all.

       I was so busy writing about my computer I forgot about Al. He got back today and he sounded like he had a lot of fun. It was actually a church trip. Al tubed and did all sorts of things. I guess I was wrong. This is definitely the last thing I'll blog about all night, but I have all of tomorrow!

       I crashed my computer, and when I mean crashed I really mean killed. First it was acting jittery when I logged in and I kept using system restore to try to figure out what it was. The system restore died and took everything with it. I hate Windows. I lost every bit of data I owned. It could be worse...... couldn't it?

       I spent the night with my grandparents last night and had a good time. We played cards and Memo (Mee-mo) and my mom beat me and Papa. I was not too happy. I wanted to burn the cards. I kept drawing the same cards!

       I am so lonely o so lonely. With Austin gone, I think I will just call him Austin from now on, Al off for a few days, the boredom never ends. This is just the beginning. I guess it's just me, the T.V., and the computer. I hope Al is happy with me when he gets back. I have lost enough weight for my laptop, but now I have to wait or beg. That's almost a hard decision. I choose begging. Does that make me lowly? I say no, I just want to get what I was promised. I call it strategically placed conversation.

       This morning I woke up sore. I think it was from riding the tube. Al is mad at me for not taking him, but Austin was about to leave for his dad's and I just got done spending the night with him. I told him he could go tomorrow, but he's going with Chris to the lake. Chris has no boat, so he probably won't have as much fun with him as he would with me. It was his choice and he can do anything he wants to. I mean he could have loads of fun....... maybe.

       Last night I spent the night with Austin. We woke up about eight something then my mom called to see if we wanted to go to the lake. An hour later we went to the lake. I had Austin and my sister had her friend. We went tubing and we swam and had lots of fun. Next time I will take Al with me, I took Austin because he has to leave tomorrow. We will have plenty of time to go again.

       I just got done watching the part of my show I missed. I thought you might like to know what movie I went to see with my cousin. We went to see Pirates of the Caribbean. It was better than I though it would be. It had a huge amount of action in it, but also had some comedy. The only down side was that it was two and 1/2 hours long, but who cares I didn't have any thing to do anyways.

       I made myself a schedule last night for today. I tried to wake up this morning at 6:50, but the alarm did not go off. Why did I want to wake up so early, to watch T.V. of course. So I missed the first thirty minutes of my show. Not to worry it reruns at 11:00. So I'm about to watch it. Back to my schedule, I wanted to get my package returned then walk a mile and a 1/2 and take a shower. I have done all those except drop off the package. So I just hope the rest of the day goes this smooth.

       Tonight I am in just a overall bad mood. I need to lose one more pound to get my laptop and besides that my mom says I have to wait till the 21st. I am not to happy with this. Thus, the reason for my extremely bad mood! Maybe I can get her to change her mind.

       I called Ryan one of those not so friendly friends, and figured out I have no classes with him. Yay! My cousin is coming over in a little while (My mom's sister's daughter). We will probably go see a movie. Last, but not least let me breakdown my friends. First we have Al. This guy is very happy go lucky, but is not interested in all the same things I am. Then we have Austin. He likes almost everything I like (excluding music). Then there is the dreaded Ryan! He is evil almost all the time and tricks you into being his friend. After he tricks you he gets what he wants then he leaves you in the dust. These are my good and not so good friends.

       The first thing I did today, was try to walk on the treadmill. The treadmill has this safety thing on it that stops it if it gets unplugged, and I ended up pulling it out in the middle of my walk. This made me very upset, so I just quit. I'll try again tomorrow.

       I start my diet today. I'm so excited, but with only two more pounds to lose it won't be so bad. As soon as I get my powerbook I will have my website up and I'll put a link to it from here as soon as I get it. Today will just be a lazy day of dieting and exercising. Maybe not so much lazy!

       I went on the boat, but I stayed on it the whole time. I did not bring anything to swim in. I could have gone in, but they said we might go out to eat and that's why I did not go in... then we did not go out to eat.

        Just to let you know about three weeks ago my mom said that if I lost fifteen pounds she would get me a brand new powerbook, so I've been trying to lose weight. The first two weeks I lost about five pounds then I went on vacation and I did really bad on my diet. Suprisingly I got back and I had lost eight pounds (all together)! I'm so excited! I need to only lose ten pounds if I walk three days a week for a year. So be cheering for me (I need it)!

       I went to school yesterday, It was kind of scary. I got through it though. I'm  excited about it. I think I'll have fun. Kat's birthday is today, but not the party it's sunday night. She's 17. Ok, bye.

       Yesterday I wen to my grandparents house, and did some work. I am lazy. So this is different. Me and my sister pulled down dead branches from the trees with a block of wood tied to some rope. We would throw the block over then pull it down. It was pretty fun. I liked it because I could throw it better than my sister. After we got the branches down we threw them in a fire outside. It was hot already, but it was really hot close to the fire. That was a fun day.

       We went on the boat yesterday it was me, Al, Kat and two of her friends. It started out normal and fun, until Andrew threw Kat off the tube a bunch. She got kind of mad and made him tube and he was taunting her while he was on the tube and she went fast to knock him off, not to mention she flipped him off. After he fell off the second time he swam off and would not get back in the boat. So we tubed more and came back for him and he said nothing to use and it was like that the whole way home. When we got home he got his stuff and left. He did not even take his friend home he brought. I thought he was strange for acting so dumb. I go back to school Friday. I really don't like school, but this is new and I might like it. So wish me luck on my school, but I'll probably write again before that.

       The boat is fixed, we went twice in a row. Now you know. I really like rhyming. I can't spell, at least I don't think I can. We went to church today and Al is spending the night. I saw Mr. Gary, he has cancer, I feel so sorry for him. He looked kind of rough. I hate that this happened to him.....

       I have not been writing very much lately, I think it's because I've been sapping the last of summer. My great uncle has some sort of cancer and mom has been going up to the hosptital a lot. He is not extremely old, I liked him pretty good even though I did not see him much. In other news the boat is broken again. I'm telling you that boat is going to end up costing twice as much with all the fixing we have to get on it. I guess that's it, well there was this dream where I shot E.T., but I won't get in to that.

       I went on the boat again. I know it's just boat all the time. I guess, that's all I blog about or maybe that's the only exciting thing that happens. Today's special boating contestants are Al, Kat, Me, and the unknown Andrew (just a friend of my sisters and just a friend). We discovered on our wonderfull journey on the lake that tubing is more fun just going over really big waves. I also tried, well me and Al, to ski. I hate skiing. I guess I just don't try hard enough. My sister Kat always does everything and I don't do anything special, besides mess with computers. That was my pity party I hope you had fun. Bye

       I know it's a little late, but I had to tell you about the boat trip I had today. I went with my sister and her two friends to the lake, I really did not want to go. I went and It was wierd. Her two friends were Ben and Charity. I had an interesting time. I can't say I hate Ben, but he confuses me and my opinions toward him. Anyway, we go on the lake and we have fun, but toward the end Kat and Ben rode together going slow so they would not fall off (well I was driving). Then me and Charity were like lets stop and we did and we watched them goof off, then they got back on. Why do they think we stopped to begin with! Now Kat is mad at me and I don't care, I just told mom what happened. For the wrap up I'm at Al's and last night Kat's friends did not come over. I know I'm confusing. Sorry, and good night.

       I just got to writing, as you can tell by the time. I have to hurry now my sister's friends are coming over. Now the simplified version of my day. Today was my mom's birthday. Yesterday me and my sister made supper for her, I cooked steak. Yay! Last night I spent the night with Al. The End.

       It always seems I write about things a day after they happen, I must just have to much of an exciting life. I went to the lake yesterday and tried out all of our new gear. The tube we got is huge! Three people can fit on it at once. Al went with me along with my mom and sister. We got up early, because we thought it would rain. We all got there about nine and stayed until about lunch, we had to leave because it was about to rain. Nothing really out of the ordinary, I guess boating is not much of a rush as it used to be. It was still fun though. I wish we got some skis (how do you spell that?). That might make it more exciting.

       First, I have to tell you about my dentist appointment from yesterday. I had a root canal about two weeks ago and I had to come back for a permanent filling. So it was normal he drilled a little while, and then started sticking this rubber stuff in the hole. I thought well he knows what he's doing so I won't worry. Then he lit a blow torch thing and pulled out this dark tipped tooth picker thing. I could not believe what was happening. He heated it until it was almost red hot and stuck it on the rubber stuff to melt it. All this smoke just went into my face and scared me to death. I survived. Another interesting story happened later. I went to my friend's house and my mom was gone, but I told my sister I was going to Al's house. My sister never told my mom, and my mom thought I was there all night. She woke up and looked in my bed and I was no where to be found then she wakes up Kat and asked where I was. Kat said I was over at Al's and my mom called me and got a little mad, but she was the one who did not notice I was missing!

       I have Al over here and we just picked him up, me and him are going to Sunday school. We are going to both of them to see which one we like. I have already been and prefer the latter one.  The first on is good in some people's perspectives, but in mine they are strange. They do all sorts of odd things like make us get on our knees to pray. That's good and fine, but in Sunday school that sure will make them want to come again. They also have all the people go up and do things and the man who was over the Sunday school was pointing people out and saying if their spiritual life was good. The other one that I like starts with us all listening to the one leader, then small groups. Nice and normal.

       I'm so tired. This weekend I did lots of things that would make most people feel really tired,that includes me. Friday I stayed up till one, then I woke up at about six Saturday morning. Then one Sunday got up at seven and went to church. Then getting up at five thirty for school does not help. One happy thing is I made a A on my history test!

       "Why must school come? The thought of it makes me numb, though surely this feeling is felt by some, who think that this thing school, is such a bum." That was nice wasn't it? I made that up. School is not awful, but it is the same everyday over and over again. I miss summer.

       I have been going to school and that's fun, I have to tell you about this dumb guy in my English class. I don't know anyone, but this girl who went to Trinity so I had to be partners with this guy name is Morgan, one word retard! That was harsh I agree, but someone who can't make a paragraph or does not know what a verb is, in my book is retarded. All he does when we're in groups is copy my answers. I get so frustrated with him. That was just something for you to read until the next big juicy story.

       I missed school today. I feel bad about missing. It seems like when you miss a day of school it all slows down. The reason I missed is my stomach hurt really bad. I woke up and I just felt like I was going to puke. I think the reason is I had a Pizone from Pizza Hut. My advice, stay very far away. I feel fine now though. The positive thing is I got my homework done, so what. Now my school year will be like molasses in the middle of winter.

       I did next to nothing last night. I played Warcraft with Alan and Austin, then went to sleep. I've been getting better at tennis. I don't think I've talked about it though. I have lessons every monday. I am about to go to my fourth this monday. The man is kind of old, but I guess that does not matter. He's the kind of person who seems to fake being nice. I don't like that very well. He says every time you hit it good "that's your best shot all day". So, anyways I can almost beat Alan. Me, Alan, and Austin are going to try to play today. Maybe if I try super hard, I can defeat Alan, what am I talking about. Alan's going to crush me.

       I spent the night at Alan's last night along with Ryan. It was not that fun. Alan went to sleep at 11:00. So it was me and Ryan. Alan's coming over here and, some of Kathryn's friends. It should be different which is good. Then we will get up go to church then go to then after the day is spent we will go home and do lots of homework. Fun! Fun!

       We had a little party at my grandparents house. It was not bad. We had a lot of people there that were not part of the family. It is okay for them to come, but the only thing is I don't feel very comfortable around them. I'm about to watch a movie, so have a good night.

       I did go to computer club today and they changed their minds and now I'm a Gopher. I guess it won't be so bad. She said I could take pictures and I would get out of class to do certain things, so it's not so bad. My sister told me something about we might not have to go to school tomorrow, but I'm sure we will. I guess it won't kill me to hope just a little.

       Tomorrow we have another computer club meeting. I am very curious about what will happen and if I truly will be as a Grunt. It won't matter that much because we just have to go to school three days this week, then it will be wonderful Thanksgiving. This Thanksgiving will be no different from the others, which is not bad at all. I'm pretty excited. One last thing, my birthday's on December 2nd and I can get my permit, but all that will come soon enough.

       School yesterday was not as bad as I predicted. It still goes just as fast as normal. I just thought I would tell you. Alan is a little bit mad at me so this weekend will not be much fun. Austin, if he's here, I can do something with, but I don't know if he is here or not. He might be at his dad's house.

       I went to my first computer club at school today. I think a lot of people signed up, but counting me there were only three. We went in and she had this design on the board for the school website. She then asked who had Microsoft Front Page. I had never heard of it, but those other two people had it and she said that's all right you can do the grunt work. I was what I like to call extremely displeased. I just want to scream! I looked that up and it cost 150 dollars. Who buys stuff like that? Let me tell you, next time I sure am not going to be called a grunt!

       I have no homework? How can this be? My teachers must be brainwashed, maybe they'll never get over it. It is kind of strange, maybe the only reason we had so much before is we started school late. All those hours of making sure all that homework was perfect..... what am I saying? I wrote a paper and defined 11 words this morning at 5:30, don't worry though I finished the last nine words.I made the definitions up, but I still made a 100. Even though, it's still nice not to have to worry!

       That person, you know Morgan, he's gone. He changed his classes. He now has English in fourth instead of third. I don't understand either. The dreaded part of it is he might be in my class for wellness next semester. He is a football player and ..... I'm not. Bad compatibility to start and now in wellness, you know the class where you go play football everyday. Now is a time of peace and prosperity. I will enjoy.

       I went to a haunted house last night and it was pretty crazy. My legs hurt so much and we did not go to bed till two. My legs hurt because, we stood for three hours straight! I don't think it was worth it now looking back. I had fun, we played lots of Nintendo and ate some food. His mom is a pretty good cook. I do appreciate a good break in the normal routine. It is so nice peaceful no homework to worry with, well I do have a little Biology, but lets not think about that. I foresee that the rest of my weekend will be nice and happy.

       I actually had fun at the Brewer Bash. All the people I did not like, didn't come. These two cousins or whatever they are to me are very interesting. They are very polite and call their parents mother and father, they're like five and seven. They are super polite and bright, as in smartness. As strange as they were, they were nice. Something that made them nice was that they were quiet. I don't really like rowdiness. Besides all that I'm a little sick. My sister was sick and gave it to Al (he eats anything in sight regardlessly) who gave it to me. I hope I do something for New Years. That would be nice.

       I had all my Christmas stuff over at my grandmother's house and it was fun, but tomorrow holds another party, an unwelcome party. The Brewer Bash as it has come to be know is going to be held at my house. The Brewers, whose last name I can't hardly link to mine, are some people I never see. The ones that pinch your cheeks and say I last saw you when you were two feet tall. I can't contain the joy ..........

       I got my driving permit today. I'm very relieved. I studied for a little bit, but it wasn't very hard. I missed one. I haven't driven yet, but I want to. Maybe I'll get really good. Then I can maybe pass the drivers license test a little easier. I'm so old and authorized.

       I have art. We started making cardboard sculptures. I started to try and make a flower, it was harder than I thought. So from the ashes of my flower a pig was formed( the pieces resembled a pig). I worked and worked. I mixed my colors to from the perfect piggy skin and there it was finished. I had a disturbing thing happen to this perfect cardboard pig, people would stop and say "What is that?". It is amazing to me to here this question, because it is clearly in my view..... a pig.

       My birthday is today, I've had my first period class sing to me, well about half of them. Everyone gave me some money from my lunch table. As far as party wise I'm just going out to eat with my grandparents. I kind of wish I could have a party. I don't have a super amount of friends so it wouldn't be that big. My sister always has a party, but of course she has a lot more friends. It will be fun, me my mom and Kat will watch X-Men 2. My birthday will be a blast.

       So far in me and Al's competition, he is winning. I've got to try harder. I just make stupid mistakes all the time. The thing that would really help is if he failed a test. I almost hate wishing bad things on people, but I will never give up.

       Alan thinks he can make a better grade than me in Algebra, so we're having a contest. Whoever has the highest grade gets paid ten dollars from the loser. The way I see it, there is no contest.

       Alan's mad at me today. I take art and so we have to have a sketchbook. It was do today and Alan saw it and said it was ugly. I told him that he is mean to me and he kept on saying how ugly it was. I then said something like I don't make fun of stuff you do. Even after that he kept on talking so finally I burst out and said "At least I'm not an idiot that makes C's in every class. So now you see he is mad at me. My fault or his you decide.

       I just now noticed that alone has the word one in it. That seems to make sense you know being alone there is just one of you. Speaking of that, guess what? You got it, I'm all alone. Al is at a birthday party that apparently I wasn't invited to. It's okay I'll live. Austin is spending some quality time with his dad and I'm spending time with my computer. I think I'll go to bed to pass the time.

       I did do something for New Years, I had a party type thing. Alan and some of my sisters friends came over. First we watched Legally Blonde 2, don't watch it. Her dog was gay, very strange if I say so my self. After that we toasted marshmallows and made smores. I really had fun. Finally one of Kathryn's friends made healthy smoothies for dessert and they were surprisingly delicious. All was good.

       I had to go outside for P.E. yesterday, it was different. It's not really P.E., but Wellness. So we go outside some times and then we learn book junk other times. Anyway, yesterday he forces us all to play football. I know it sounds fun. I made the most of this with just trying to run from the person guarding me and believe it or not someone threw it to me. I was not expecting it so when I turned around I saw it fly over my head. As you can imagine some people were a little, well, lets just say less than happy. Who cares, it's just a game!

       Today I got a call from the newspaper. They wanted to know all about my school's website which I had help create. I'm guessing that I will be in the paper, surely. It's funny that they called me since I know the least about the website. He asked me a bunch of questions about the website and just a bunch of junk. I am very excited, though, about seeing my name in the paper, of course it could be embarrassing in that everyone will know that I'm in the computer club. I guess you just got to take the good with the bad.

       I want to be on spring break so bad. All the private schools got out last week and I really want my break now. Where is my break? I'll tell you, it's three weeks away. I just want out for a week, just one little week, preferably now. Is that really that much, I didn't think so. Maybe the weeks ahead will just zip by, yeah right.

       I signed up for an ACT prep class, because my sister wanted some company while she was taking it. Last night was our first night to class and it was a little boring. All you do is take tests for three hours! There was a small positive side to this, I made a 31 on the reading part of the test. The other tests I did not do as well on, I made two 24's on English and in Science Reasoning. I have to go twice a week for a month, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I figured that up to be about 24 hours. That's right, a whole day of taking tests!

       Well, I got my progress report and I was one point behind Al. I had a little bit trouble coming to grips with it, but it was only one point. He didn't take the ten dollars. I guess maybe he thought that my nine weeks grade might beat him. Maybe...... Maybe not.

       I feel a little guilty today, because I have not been to regular church in almost 2 months. I guess I'm almost a certified heathen, but then again I do go to Sunday school every week. There are two big differences between normal church and Sunday school. Well, church is sort of boring, and Sunday school is not. Today at Sunday school we went to McDonald's, and it was pretty fun. The way I see it is that church is like a class and you should try to learn, but like a class it is boring.

       Vacation was cold! The water was so freezing that when I came out I felt numb all over. Besides that though it was pretty fun. First we just played cards some, then later in the week we rented a kayak. Kayaking is fun, even though I tipped over a lot. It was also a little painful when the waves beat it into your knees. We paddled all around then went to the sand bar and looked for shells. One thing that makes me sad is that it snowed around three inches while we were gone. I really wanted to play in it or maybe even just to see it.

       Al and one of Kathryn's friends will be going with us, so it should be pretty fun. We leave tomorrow, at 7:30. I don't know if I'm excited about waking up that early, but I guess it will give us more beach time. The down side is I think I'm going to come down with a case of technology withdrawal, but what the heck I probably spend to much time on the computer anyways. I still have not even packed either!

       It is finished! The transfer of entries and editing of old ones complete. Now I just want to kick back and throw my computer out the window. I feel a little guilty by being able to finish when I should be at school. I am skipping first period, because if I'm late one more time I have community service. I figured that if I skipped first period I would just have an absence instead of a tardy, thus no community service. I only have 2 3/4 days of school left. That's what I have to keep telling myself.

       I wake up, go to school, come back, and go to sleep. Then on the weekends I invite my friends over. The weekends are all right, but I need a variety of things to do. I think a short out of town weekend trip or something like that would change the monotony that is my life. As soon as summer gets here everything will be better, maybe.

       It's been a while since I wrote last so I'll just fill you in. I first went to my physics class for half the time it was boring and after I left the man said I missed the most fun part... weighing a car without a scale. I can't believe I missed it, I mean that sarcastically of course. Then later this week I went to the lake where I had fun, but it was a little hectic. My relatives had some arguments, I still had fun though. Oh, and one last funny thing that happened was the boat started to sink. Everyone was in the boat with buckets trying to get the water out. It was a hoot! The boat's fine, so there's not even a downside, which means double the hilarity.

       Oh, what an interesting day I've had, but first let us backtrack a moment. My mom "surprised" me by signing me up for an adventures in physics summer camp for two weeks. As bad as that seems, it's worse. This camp is only for 6th through 9th graders which leaves me in the minority. Yesterday, I went, looked in the room, saw all the 6th graders and left. Today I was thinking I needed to go and just see how I liked it, but I got there late, they had already started, and the door was closed. I decided to wait one more day until I tried again. Then it occurred to me, "What will I do for three hours". Without my cell phone, I first set out to find a pay phone. I thought a college would have a pay phone, but no luck. I thought to myself, "I'm at Union... I'm pretty close to home". So I began my three to four mile trek home. It began smoothly until I noticed I had a callous and was wishing I had worn some tennis shoes. About 1/4 of the way through my trip I was thinking maybe some good Samaritan will help me, preferably some Samaritan I knew. Within a few minutes of those thoughts my Aunt Judy pulled over and gave me a ride home, she has now become my favorite aunt. I think I will call today "My Adventures to Home".

       I got back from summer camp. It was a lot of fun. The first thing I did was go mountain biking. I thought I would not have enough strength to get up some of the hills, but I made it all right. The second thing I did was ride horses. I thought that they would just lead you around, but they just told you how to steer and threw you on it. My horse was good, but some of the horses were not very nice and were prone to bucking. My last at camp activity was going inside two caves. They had mice in them and were pitch dark. If I had been by myself I would have had a heart attack. The finale of the week was white water rafting. It was a little weaker than I expected. Both times I road on the back and just got splashed a little. It was okay though, I had fun at the actual camp. I'm not mad at Alan for not going either, if he had been there I would not have been forced to make new friends and there were plenty of interesting people there. I had so much, I think I'll go back next year.

       I leave for summer camp tomorrow, bright and early at eight. I wanted Alan to go so bad, but he just didn't want to go. I only do most everything he wants and "I just don't want to" is not good enough. I'm sure I'll have fun anyway, he'd probably just be a hindrance. To top all that Austin is back this week from his dad's house and will be leaving this Friday, which is when I'll be getting back. That means I won't see Austin for five weeks. I would have just not gone except my mom already paid the $260 for it and it's non-refundable. I just hope that this will be the most awesome five days of my summer. Anything less will just be... unsatisfactory.

       One day of school is all that remains of my freshman year of high school. I feel like my life has speed up so much. It makes me a little sad. I do enjoy not having to do, well, much of anything. In three years all my friends will go off to different colleges and I'll start my friend making process at square one. Wow, that's too depressing for the end of my year, I still have summer to do anything I like such as swimming, going to the lake, sleeping, etc. My summer will be fun and relaxing. Away from that, I made a few changes to how my blog looks. I think it adds more personality and obviously color. Which I think is a good thing,

       I'm going to have an entertaining two weeks ahead of me. First I am going to Dollywood with Mom, Kathryn, Papa, and Me-Mo then I'm going to Destin with some other family members including my intermediate ones. Dollywood I'm not to sure what to expect. I hate roller coasters and I don't think listening to county music could be too fun, but you never know. As far as Destin is concerned I think I will have plenty of fun. Aunt Judy, Stephanie, and Julie are always fun to be around!

       Kathryn got back from Brazil about a week ago and I am very glad she is back. She washed other people's feet, brushed their teeth, and helped them build things. That is a great thing to do, but personally I don't think I could take it. Firstly, I can't stand manual labor and I hate doing things are gross like brushing other people's teeth and washing their feet. I don't mind helping people, but surely there are other things besides that. A new project that I've been participating in is walking/jogging every night. I go with my mom, sister, Aunt Judy, my cousin Julie, and sometimes her sister Stephanie. We go about two miles and I think it makes me feel better. We didn't go last night because everyone was busy, but I think we'll try again tonight.

       I've decided to stay at home by myself today. My mom went to work and my sister went to a mission trip to Brazil. Mom won't be back until five or six this afternoon. It's been rough without Kathryn, mom has made me go with her everywhere it seems like. I guess when Kathryn's here we sort of split the workload. Today I think I'll clean the house up a little. I worked for a little while, just picking up trash and I put a load of laundry in. The laundry I'm worried about, since I mixed some khakis, blue jeans, and towels. That seemed okay to me. They are all a rougher type cloth than other things. My mom called and told me the towels might turn the khakis different colors. Thank goodness I only put two towels in there!

       Fourth of July was pretty good I guess. We went to my grandparents house and shot some fireworks, but they don't impress me as much as they used to. I have more fun playing with sparklers. It was me and Alan and a bunch of Kathryn's friends. Next year I'd like to use all our money to buy one big firework. That would be much more fun than just a bunch of little ones.

       I went to Westover for church today. I enjoy going over there, Englewood just doesn't have anyone my age in Sunday school.  The Westover people convinced me to go on a youth retreat with them to Natchez Trace. It will probably be enjoyable and perhaps I can befriend some of the Westoverians. I'm leaving at two O'clock today and I'll return Wednesday afternoon. Then on Thursday I'll leave for Dollywood. I like having such a full schedule, it keeps me busy.
