      Another great  urlLink article  by Max Blumenthal. I think the parallel he makes,- from the brutality brewing in the US prison system which exploded due to the "war on drugs" to the brutality of Abu Ghraib,- is a very good point. I tend to think that Americans are yet to understand that being brutal to somebody,- whether at home or at war in a foreign land,- is something the nation pays for as its citizens come back home traumatized, confused and violent. And not all problems can be addressed by way of war and aggression alone. Neither the issue of drug abuse, nor the issue of terrorism can be resolved that way.

      Thanks to Max Blumenthal's  urlLink astute observation , we now get a glimpse at what appears to be the inner mechanics of how politically expedient intelligence is at times manufactured. So, if Mr Blumenthal got it right, it appears that Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan who was recently captured in Pakistan and presented in many media sources as a major Al Quaeda figure was in reality a Pakistani agent helping that country's counter-intelligence services in capturing Al Quaeda operatives. He appears nonetheless to be outed, and his capture and materials he alleged to have carried were used for the US Homeland Security Department to issue another terror alert. And it was issued at a time the administration could use it,- a good time to divert the public attention from the issues raised at the DNC as well as from the reports that 1,000 US soldiers have died in foreign wars under this administration's watch.

      This a classic Libertarian perspective,-  urlLink question the government  and its motives at all times. Especially in times like these, I would add. On this, I am 100% with the Libertarians.

      Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Guantanamo prisoner, has filed a  urlLink lawsuit  against the US Government alleging torture at the hands of his American captors and challenging the constitutionality of the military tribunals for those captured in the "war on terror". The fact that a US Federal Court is now hearing the case is an important step forward for the rule of law, and a significant defeat for the Administration who claimed that it had a right to operate outside the oversight of the legal system in Guantanamo.  However, while I wish Mr Hamdan every bit of luck in obtaining the justice for himself,- that justice being his right to be tried in a court of law with the full protections granted to a defendant as opposed to a military tribunal, as well as getting those who violated his human rights prosecuted,- I believe that such isolated trials are not enough, even if the plaintiffs obtain justice there. I believe we as a society, all of us who adhere to the principles of Constitution regardless of their other beliefs, must state unequivocally that the Administration's attempts to operate outside of the law will not stand. We should write to the public figures, hold demonstrations in the streets, publish our views on the web and in the print media,- in other words, make it heard loud and clear that we demand that all laws of the land as well as international laws our country has ratified be respected by all executive officials.  And if you think that doing so may be tantamount to defending the people possibly involved in terror,- think of it differently. Our laws are not lenient when it comes to terrorism,- our courts can mete out a punishment severe enough to match the crime. Timothy McVeigh was executed for blowing up the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. Those responsible for the 1993 attack on the WTC are jailed for life. Thus we need not worry about the guilty not being punished. That may happen,- but anyone can be fooled, military authorities included.   And it is your own safety you are protecting by demanding that all executive authorities operate within the scope of the law. It is for your own sake that you are making sure that no government agents will take you away and lock you up in a prison brig as "enemy combatant". I grew up in a country where a whole generation of people lived through years when every family feared a knock on the door at night, where those lead away in the early morning hours often just vanished, leaving their families to tend for themselves as outcasts and pariahs. May no one have to live through that horror and learn what they had learned about what unconstrained government agents with a vengeance can do!

      In her excellent and very insightful  urlLink article  Edmonds, the former FBI translator, provides a very deep analysis of how the turns and twists of her case reflect on our system of government at this juncture. There's little I would like to say here other than raise the same issues she is attempting to raise.  On Tuesday, July 6, 2004, Judge Reggie Walton made a decision and ruled on my case. Under his ruling, I, an American citizen, am not entitled to pursue my 1st and 5th Amendment rights guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States. The vague reasoning cited, without any explanation, is to protect "certain diplomatic relations for national security." Judge Walton reached this decision after sitting on this case with no activity for almost two years. He arrived at this decision without allowing my attorney and I any due process: NO status hearing, NO briefings, NO oral argument, and NO discovery. He made his decision after allowing the government attorneys to present their case to him, privately,  in camera ,  ex parte ; we were not allowed    to participate in these cozy sessions. Is this the American system of justice    we believe in?  It is also worth noting that for some reason Attorney General John Ashcroft seems to now be in a position to impose restrictions on the Congress. That is a situation which is almost synonymous to a total tyranny of the executive power.   Under this broken system the attorney general of the United States is being allowed to illegally gag the United States Congress regarding my case. And even worse, the United States Congress is readily complying with this illegal gag.  Under this broken system the attorney general of the United States is being allowed to hinder ongoing investigations such as those of the 9/11 Commission and the DOJ-Inspector General.  Under this broken system the Attorney General of the United States is getting away with interfering and tampering with pending cases under the judicial process, such as my court cases and the lawsuit by the 9/11 victim families. I have nothing to add to that. I only think it is wrong to think of Sibel Edmonds' case as only a case involving one individual. It it of crucial importance,- and its outcome may seriously affect the direction in which this society is going to move.

      I am not religious, so I don't fear hell, at least not consciously. However, I do believe in the existence of morals, and their importance for the living. I think Mr Hoffman  urlLink describes  very vividly the feeling of moral outrage and hopelessness which many people, myself included, face time and again when great tragedies like the genocide in Rwanda, or in Sudan, or many other world's tragedies are allowed to happen to the tune of inaction on the part of those who have the means to prevent them. I believe that there is no such thing as inaction. Inaction, in my opinion, is merely one of the many courses of action available to us. And we are responsible for our actions,- and that includes inaction.

       urlLink All the more reason  to question the authenticity of the recent execution videos. I have watched a few, most look realistic,- at least to me,- excepting the Nick Berg video. To learn more about Nick Berg's death and many suspicious circumstances surrounding it see  urlLink this link  and many others. I am not offering any theories of my own on what happened to the unfortunate Mr Berg,- I simply do not have enough information to go on. However, I suspect that the tape of his execution is a fake. Many people around the world have conducted expert investigations of that video and they also have serious doubts as to its authenticity.

      It is certainly welcome news that many lawyers  urlLink condemn  their colleagues employed by the US Government who authored legal memos authorizing torture and essentially advising the administration on how to avoid responsibility for torture which according to the legal codes of all the civilized nations is listed amongst the gravest of offenses. However, a verbal condemnation only goes so far. I think some action is in order here.  I believe the lawyers as a profession must take a stand and eject those administration lawyers from the legal profession. I believe that not only emotionally and morally, but also professionally this would be the right course of action. While no expert myself, I certainly believe that many statements made by the US government's legal representatives are void of logic and go against the letter, not only the spirit, of many laws that are on the book in the US. That means, they are, in layman's terms, illiterate when it comes to knowing their trade,- or they act that way, which in the final run is immaterial. I believe lawyers acting that way must be prevented from ever practicing law again. I also think it would be a powerful lesson to this administration and its successors when they end up facing the reality of some of the critical governmental decisions having been made based on the legal advice of those found to be unfit to litigate the placement of a farm fence in a rural county courthouse.

      Political negativism is a common tool involved in the process of campaigning. One side tries to dig up all the dirt it can on their opponents who in most cases respond in kind. Provided the information used is not deliberately libelious that is normal process,- even though it does at times get ugly.  However, the latest string of attacks on the prominent Democrats' war records is beyond pale,- and, in many cases, is in fact libelious. For instance one of the key contributors to the book titled "Unfit For Command" whose objective appears to be proving Kerry unsuitable to be President has recently admitted to lying. Kerry's former commanding officer has addmitted that signing and faxing back the statement to the effect that Kerry did not deserve to be awarded his Silver Star was a  urlLink "terrible mistake" .  It is also worth mentioning the smear campaign unfurled against former  urlLink Senator Max Cleland . In her  urlLink column  Ann Coulter seems to be doing her best to establish equivalency between George W Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard and Cleland's Vietnam experience. Coulter also writes,  Moreover, if we're going to start delving into exactly who did what back then, maybe Max Cleland should stop allowing Democrats to portray him as a war hero who lost his limbs taking enemy fire on the battlefields of Vietnam.  Cleland lost three limbs in an accident during a routine noncombat mission where he was about to drink beer with friends. He saw a grenade on the ground and picked it up. He could have done that at Fort Dix. In fact, Cleland could have dropped a grenade on his foot as a National Guardsman – or what Cleland sneeringly calls "weekend warriors." Luckily for Cleland's political career and current pomposity about Bush, he happened to do it while in Vietnam.    Well, by both the official criteria and those dictated by common sense she is wrong. And I doubt she is not aware of that.  Cleland was wounded in an area that on that day had been shelled by the enemy. That area was officially designated battlefield on that day. Furthermore, Cleland had spent many days immediately preceding that day at  urlLink Khe Sahn , the site where besieged Americans and the NVA fought one of the fiercest battles of the whole war. It is true that Cleland's injuries were caused by an accident which only involved the friendly munition (in that case, a grenade accidentally dropped by another soldier which Cleland had a bad luck to pick up). However, as this occurred during combat, this sort of injury is officially viewed as a combat wound. From a common sense perspective,- wouldn't you think that a man who had been in combat for days may have been affected by the stress to the extent that his judgement got a little clouded and that could have contributed to that accident?  Be that as it may, even if you discount the accident in which Max Cleland lost three limbs, he had still distinguished himself sufficiently to be called a hero. His Silver Star and Bronze Star attest to that. That makes what Coulter is saying all the more reprehensible. The same goes for those who used an ad in which Max Cleland's image was put next to those of Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden, the objective beign to call Senator Cleland's patriotism into quetion. That ad ran during  urlLink Saxby Chambliss 's Senate election bid against Cleland.  I believe that no matter what one's politics, one should respect war heroes for the courage they had demonstrated and recognized smear campaigns like the ones desribed above for what they are,- vicious assaults of unscrupulous political figures who, in essense, have little else to say.

      Might be an  urlLink interesting book . I don't know for a fact that  urlLink Jayna Davis  is on to something, but she surely acts it.  I tend to look at her version of events a little skeptically. Especially the Iraq part of the puzzle. Iraqi agents tried to assassinate the former President George H W Bush in 1993, the US retaliated by leveling one of the key intelligence buildings in Baghdad, and Saddam &amp; Co seemed to have gotten the message.  Be it as it may, there are still many questions about what truly went down in OKC on April 19, 1995. If I were to state one reason why it is perfectly legitimate to question the official version of the events I would state the following. The tape recording from a camera located across the street from where McVeigh parked the famous Ryder truck is still not available for public viewing. While it would be understandable for this tape to be kept under lock as evidence while related court cases where winding their way through the system, there is no legitimate explanation I can come up with for why that recording should still be kept classified. Keep in mind,- all we are talking about is a view of a public street in the middle of a major US city.

      There are many laws and regulations that control our daily activities. However, we should not forget that there is a document upon which they are based and to which they must conform,- namely, the US Constitution.  Apparently, the FBI has recently circulated a  urlLink flier  designed to aid the law enforcement officers in recognizing potential terrorists. Among other things it lists a person's proclivity to "make numerous references to US Constitution" as an indication that the person may be inclined towards terrorism. That is a very troubling assertion.  One one hand, there are extremists who wrap their hateful agenda in the US Constitution. However, every imaginable ideology, secular or religious, has also been used for the same purpose. But we do not see the flier advising police officers that Christians, Muslims, Judaists or Buddhists must automatically be viewed as terrorist suspects. Nor does the flier suggest that everyone wearing jeans must be viewed with suspicion,- even though terrorists have been known to so dress.  I believe that knowing the Constitution is a right,- no, scratch that, a responsibility of every citizen. Referencing it, especially when dealing with a law enforcement officer, is also an inalienable right. That officer does have a certain authority, but he is merely a citizens' servant,- and there is nothing wrong with reminding him of his status in this relationship.  I believe this flier is an outrage, it needs to be immediately revised, and those who authored it need to be given a refresher course on the US history and the role of Constitution.

      I am not 100% sure how the  urlLink data  was obtained. There certainly is quite a number of people who move between the two countires on the regular basis so it may be hard to tell which one they really call home.  But overall this data is not surprising.   The exodus has stirred up a discussion in Israel, said Boruch Gorin, head of the public relations department at the Russian Federation of Jewish Communities, which commissioned the study. On the one hand, millions of Jews already live outside Israel. On the other hand, "living in Israel is an ideology, and that the people who sought a shelter in the country have been leaving is a blow to the ideology," he said.   Maybe it is indeed time to address the issue of the ideology Mr Gorin is talking about.

      I don't fully agree with the  urlLink article  on some points. For instance, it is not a given that there is no alternative renewable power source sufficient to provide enough power for the residents of the US-style urban sprawl.  However, while it may not be the case that we are at war for survival, I think we are definitely in a struggle for survival,- the struggle to find new resources, new fuels that would allow us to avoid having the world as we know it come to an end. I fully believe that developing alternative fuel technologies is a matter of life and death, a matter of survival. I believe that here, in the US, we must give it the highest priority, and make as much of an effort to develop the relevant technology as the effort that went into making an atomic weapon during the World War II. Maybe, an even bigger effort is required. That should not stop us for, as Thomas Wheeler correctly observes,  any system based on the use of nonrenewable resources is unsustainable.

      Well, I surely had a good laugh reading this  urlLink article .  However, on a more serious note,- if what is stated there is true, if as of January 2004 Osama Bin Laden was still not flagged to be immediately detained lest he attempt to board an airliner in the US,- maybe we've got a problem. Maybe we as citizens should stop thinking that the fact that the authorities are allegedly on the case in and of itself is a guarantee that somebody is actually enganged in any meaningful counter-terrorism activity.

      The link above is to the  urlLink document  allegedly authored by Osama Bin Laden to present his case for fighting the US. I believe it is important for us to understand why the enemy is the way he is; I also believe that the mainstream media have largely obscured the picture by presenting mostly the third-party interpretations of what Bin Laden thinks,- especially when such interpretations are overly emotional and thus inevitably biased.

      Professor Yoshi Tsurumi's recollection of the man who later became our President adds a new and interesting  urlLink perspective  to what we know about that man. I do not want to get into the partisan politics, or those of class, however, sometimes I can not help it. Here is a really interesting sentiment of the young George W Bush as Professor Tsurumi puts it:   Even though it was over 30 years ago, Tsurumi "vividly" recalls Bush the student making this stunning statement in his classroom at Harvard: "People are poor because they are lazy."   It is most certainly true that of the roughly 50% of today's US voters who support Bush some qualify to be called poor. I do not want to try and dictate to those people whom to support, what to think, or how to live their lives. I would only like to ask them one question, "Do you consider yourself lazy?" Because the man whom you intend to vote for in the Presidential election thinks you are.

      I think the  urlLink assessment of the US as an empire  is to a large extent correct. It is not an empire in classical sense, not like the Roman Empire where the Emperor had an almost unlimited power and was appointed pretty much for life. However, the US foreign policy is much akin to that of an empire.  Don't exactly know why,- maybe, because I grew up in the USSR,- but the very idea of an empire makes me wary. I think it is very important for the US to work towards becoming just "power like many other" as opposed to a hyper power. It is just that people and states are fallible,- and none should have the temptation of being unconstrained.

       urlLink "Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear & the Selling of American Empire"  has a chance of being a really interesting documentary. Personally, I am highly interested in what Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski has to say as she is one of the few people who had been deeply involved in the Pentagon part of the show during a crucial time period when the intelligence on Iraq was being collected and assessed and are now available to be inteviewed in public. I have not yet watched the whole film but I think I'll order it soon. For more detail go  urlLink to this page .

      I think this  urlLink documentary  by  urlLink Blue Moose Films  is something everyone who is interested in the today's US must see. Personally, my disagreements with it are not insignificant. However, I think it raises the issues avoided by other cinematic productions I have seen thus far.  I think it does a good job of showing the erosion of the civil liberties in the US after 9/11. It also raises a lot of unanwered questions about the 9/11,- questions the mainstream media mostly fail to ask.  I think it also offers some interesting perspectives on the US and the world,- though somewhat one-sided perspectives, IMHO.

      Here is a  urlLink letter  the former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds has written to Thomas Kean, Chairman Of The 9/11 Commission.  A couple of comments here, if I may. The letter above summarizes the experiences of just one woman, working in a fairly low-level position for the FBI for a short period of a mere several months. Let us take it with a grain of salt, as she may be bitter or highly subjective for other reasons, and, for the sake of argument, discount half of what she is saying. We still get a very grim picture of glaring omissions in the relevant portions of the 9/11 report.  Let us also for the sake of argument assume that everything stated in the report is 100% true,- which may be the case,- but let us merely assume that the "omission ratio", so to speak, in parts of the reports other than the ones Sibel Edmonds' experience is relevant to, is comparable to that in the sections she is discussing in her letter. That leaves us with a report so incomplete as to be almost irrelevant. It is akin to a building which is made of quality materials,- but in which entire floors are missing.  Personally, having myself spent almost three years working in a government facility, I don't have any problem viewing all of Ms Edmonds' allegations as entirely realistic. I can very easily indeed imagine things like that happening.  So, my advice to those who choose to trust the 9/11 commission report is,- do what makes you happy, just remember,- there may be ten feet of snow between what you have chosen to believe and the truth, as this report appears to be a mass-scale snow job.  I would also like to add that I think we are all very lucky indeed that there are people like Sibel Edmonds out there, and should do what we can to help her weather the  urlLink storm  she is now in.

      In a few months we as a nation are facing an important decision: who will lead us for the next four years. There are many issues associated with that choice, and clearly it is but impossible to address them all.  However, there are many things an election accomplishes. One of them, an important one, is the evaluation of the job the incumbent administration has done.  The current administration has come to the office with a set of promises, of which many seemed to have remained just that: promises. One could argue, and correctly so, that the world has changed dramatically since the year 2000. However, the world has not seen anything unheard of before.  The massive terror attacks of 9/11 were a really terrifying event, but the world has seen many a battle where more lives were lost. And the world, especially the so-called Third World, experiences such privation on the regular basis that 9/11 simply pales in comparison. And that, I believe, is part of context in which 9/11 ought to be viewed.  However, the Bush administration presented these events as the "end of the world as we know" and did a very thorough job of trying to convince Americans that this should also be the end of America as we know it. The almost immediate reaction of the government was to claim that it did not have sufficient powers to properly address the issue of terrorism, and thus needed a massive extension of its powers. It also claimed that the separation of powers,- which happens to be one of the key elements of our social order as envisioned by the Founding Fathers,- was a major obstacle in the fight against terrorism.  The Defense Department and the White House claimed the right to indefinitely detain those they consider to be a threat. The Patriot Act allowed the executive branch to take numerous types of action unsupervised by the courts. The idea behind that was that the government has our best interest in mind, and we should just let it proceed unimpeded.  However, that is not what this country is about. It was not founded to be about comfort or security,- it was founded to be about liberty and responsibility. And there is a price to pay for that,- and many have paid this price, and many more will. Those who think that is just a piece of empty sloganeering should read urlLink  this list  and see for themselves.  I am not a hard-core Libertarian, nor do I have a formal affiliation with any other party or movement. I simply believe that a piece-meal transformation of our society into something entirely alien to what it was meant to be is not a way to go. And I believe that this is a reason to vote against Bush in November. It may not accomplish much, but it is at least a way to send a message out that attempts to facilitate such a transformation are going to lead to defeat at the polls. And to those who think that's all I can muster,- no, I can think of many other reasons to vote against Bush, but I am not going to address them here.  I believe that in the final run, adhering to the principles set forth in the Constitution will prove the best course of action in all regards, including security. And we must not sacrifice our long-term vision for some short-term gains, real or perceived.

      Racism as a problem is nothing new; it can likely be traced to the times immemorial. We mostly notice it when we find ourselves being the target of racists; that is also not particularly surprising as we the humans always possess a certain measure of self-centeredness. But what goes around comes around, and whatever behaviour you consider morally wrong is wrong universally, regardless of whether it is your group that is practicing that behaviour, or some other group. The same goes for racism.  Racists tend to seek legitimacy by claiming that they are spiritually best endowed members of their ethnic or religious group. They tend to view those who do not hold their radical views as apostates. Quite in agreement with that pattern of behaviour, Jewish racists claim to be the truest Jews ever to tread the Earth. On a number of occasions, people of that mold informed me that they consider me not to be a real Jew. I disagree with that assessment, and I also consider racism incompatible with true morality. Sometimes extreme expressions of bigotry and prejudice make me feel that I must no longer remain silent, and thus I feel that I have to make my views known. Later in this piece I am going to address the radical publication whose existence ended up being a catalyst in motivating me to write this piece. It is just that I believe that silence in the face of extremism can sometimes be viewed as acquiescence,- and on the part of myself and hopefully many others, there is no acquiescence here.  I have recently come across the name of Rabbi Saadya Grama who had authored a Hebrew book titled "Romemut Yisrael Ufarashat Hagalut" (one possible translation: "The Grandeur of Israel and the Issue of Exile"). Among other things the book establishes the idea of Jewish superiority. The book was written in Hebrew and proved controversial enough for the only bookstore in Brooklyn, New York that was for a brief period of time selling it to pull it off the shelf. One would be correct to say that I did not put in as much effort as I could have in obtaining the book and checking it out for myself. I certainly did not; I have reason to believe, however, that that book is not something which I would want to spend much effort locating, or much money subsidizing by way of purchase. So I am relying on third-party translations and quotes in forming my opinion of this book.  In its December 19, 2003 issue "Forward" published an  urlLink article  about the book titled "Charedi Rabbis Rush To Disavow Anti-Gentile Book". This, along with other "Forward" articles, is the source I am using for my analysis of Rabbi Grama's book. It is worth noting that some of the Rabbis denouncing the book had earlier endorsed it. Thus it appears incorrect to claim that this book can be dismissed as an opinion of one individual, not supported by anybody of import.  However, Rabbi Grama and his book is just a side-show to the topic that I would like to address: the Jewish racism. Just like any other form of racism, it takes many forms and varies in its intensity as well as in its choice of a target. Based on what I get to see the prevalent strain is the idea of superiority of Jews and inferiority of others, derisively referred to as "goyim". Rabbi Grama, whose racism is radical and uncommon in its intensity, formulates it thusly:   The difference between the people of Israel and the nations of the world is an essential one. The Jew by his source and in his very essence is entirely good. The goy, by his source and in his very essence is completely evil. This is not simply a matter of religious distinction, but rather of two completely different species. This is clearly a justification for a racist view of the world. While few Jews would openly make this kind of a racist statement, a certain percentage of them appear to follow this sort of notion in some way or other. Some believe that Jews in Diaspora should avoid certain jobs that are not sufficiently prestigious. Some think that Jews should only abide by Jewish morals and customs, disregarding moral norms and customs of other societies even if they happen to reside in those societies. Some radicals believe that Jewish interests simply override any moral obligations towards the non-Jews. Racism is a complex phenomena; so is Jewish racism, and the list of its manifestations could be continued.  It would certainly be wrong to say that racism is a universal affliction amongst the Jews; I would think that it is only a minority that shares this sort of worldview. Jews as a people know as well as anybody what the toll of racism can be. That may be why Jews have been so active in many liberation movements, such as the civil rights struggle of the Black Americans in the US. And Jews have every right to fight the new wave of anti-Semitism today.  However, to bolster the morality of our demand that racism directed against us be stopped, we must first stop racism emanating from us. To that end, I would like to unequivocally state that Rabbi Grama does not speak in my name. I hope the majority of other Jews share this perception.  Unfortunately, the racist minority receives a tacit support of a silent majority that is too complacent to denounce them. Or, in some cases, that majority may be too selfish to denounce them, thinking that bigots promoting Jews are "good bigots". This perception is myopic and wrong, both from a moral perspective and from a pragmatic one. Jewish racism must be denounced,- and neither the tragic Jewish historical experience, nor the rabid racism of Israel's enemies can be used as an excuse.  As extremist minorities often are, the one proclaiming Jewish superiority as the cornerstone of its political agenda is very active politically and has enough influence to affect millions of people, both Jews and non-Jews. Those who view Arabs as subhumans certainly help perpetuate oppression of the Palestinians in the occupied territories and lack of equal rights for the Israeli Arab citizens. To the cohorts of those racists belong such prominent Israelis as the late  urlLink Rabbi Meir Kahane , late  urlLink Rehavam Zeevi  and  urlLink Rabbi Ovadia Yosef . It only appears logical, following their racist assumptions, to conclude that the suffering of the lower race (Arabs) should not be viewed as a priority problem and can be allowed to continue indefinitely so long as the master race (Jews) is not affected. That sort of sentiment is also heard at times from ordinary Jews, Israeli and otherwise, who, when pondering the various aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only concern themselves with the well-being of Jews without giving any thought as to what the other side's circumstances are.  Even if a racist ideology can win a momentary success at any given point, it corrupts the society that succumbs to bigotry and is likely to cause more suffering and misery in the future. Those who seek to humiliate others always humiliate themselves in the process. It also helps to keep in mind that victims tend to have a long memory and they are likely to try to get their payback when an opportunity presents itself. That is yet more reason for the Jews to fight racism, not espouse it.  We as Jews must send a clear message to the world that we are ready and willing to build ties with other ethnic and religious groups based upon equality and respect. That we are ready to shoulder the same responsibilities as those shouldered by others. That whether in Israel or in Diaspora we demand no special rights or privilleges not afforded to others, nor accept special responsibilities not shared by others; nor do we view ourselves superior to non-Jews. Not only is defeating the racism emanating from the Jews our collective moral duty,- it is also an integral part of the struggle against anti-Semitism.

      On July 20, 2004 Kamran Shaikh was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina. He raised the suspicions of the local authorities when he was spotted filming various buildings in the area surrounding the local bus station.  As  Chisun Lee describes in  urlLink his Village Voice article , Mr Shaikh is just a photography and videography fan. He is also a lawbreaker,- he made "false statements", in every-day English,- he lied about having a Green Card which in reality he does not hold. However, the media accounts of who he is would read drastically different to an uninitiated reader.   The man was arrested three weeks ago and ultimately charged with making "false statements"—telling authorities he had a green card when he actually does not. Lying about his immigration status was by no means angelic nor terribly bright. But press accounts this week—fueled by anonymous law enforcement speculation—made Kamran Shaikh’s fairly common violation seem like breaking news of people’s worst fears come true.  "Authorities probing whether Queens man is a . . .TERROR TOURIST," screamed the August 11 front cover of New York’s  Daily News , the scariest words conveyed in two-inch tabloid type. Shaikh was arrested July 20, when local police spotted him videotaping his surroundings near a bus depot in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina.   It is interesting how assertions like those are fed to the media.         Authorities stopped just short of uttering blatant untruths, but their ominous initial remarks fanned a media furor. "These were not your normal tourist videos. This could turn out to be something legitimate and innocent, but it’s raised our suspicions, and we think there’s something else going on here. We don’t like the look of it," was the anonymous government quote the August 11  New York Times  ran on the case.          In other words: This could be nothing, and there is no evidence that it is actually something. But we’re going to speculate wildly, anyway.   Well, Mr  Shaikh could of course be a terror operative. But to this there is no evidence. But there is ample evidence to the incompetence of the investigative authorities. For instance, if it is true that they confused background conversation in Urdu,- which is Mr Shaikh's native language and which it is alleged is the language heard spoken in the video by Mr Shaikh's company on that day,- with a conversation in Arabic, then I suppose I don't even need to comment further on the subject of the investigators' incompetence.  It very much looks that in a politicized atmosphere of today, when both internal and external intelligence officers are under enormous pressure to produce findings of a certain variety, we need to take with a grain of salt everything they come up with. And we need to question them. And pressure them to become professional and act professionally, not politically.  Also, one need not forget that true terrorists are both savvy and resourceful. For instance, if they wanted a certain building filmed,- would you think they could not pay a white, all-American video operator to film it? We should consider possibilities for ourselves,- not just rely on what the officials tell us. They are not any smarter than us; oftentimes, they are not even better informed. Furthermore, if my experience at a government facility is worth anything, years spent in a government quasi-reality oftentimes dulls both the individual's ability to perceive reality outside and their professional skills.

      There is a very interesting  urlLink web site  out there, the one hosting articles by Dean Carter, a California death row inmate. Mr Carter professes his innocence of the crime. At one point he decided to make his views on capital punishment and other issues known. He writes the articles and his friends maintain the site.  His latest  urlLink column  is dedicated to the prison abuse scandal in Iraq. I think it is very accurate in its analysis, and I highly recommend it.

      I never paid much attention to the Director of Central Intelligence nomination process taking place under way now. Don't know why,- maybe, just out of conviction that the whole system is so defective that replacing one player, however senior, is unlikely to make a difference.  However, a friend of mine emailed me with a link to an  urlLink excerpt of the interview  Rep. Porter Goss gave for Michael Moore's film  Fahrenheit 9/11 . And this, I think, is worth a comment.  In this interview, Mr Goss had clearly stated that he does not view himself as a capable candidate to a CIA position. Apparently,- correctly or incorrectly,- at that time he believed that his skills were not up to snuff to be a field agent or a case officer. So, even if he underestimated his own credentials,- what makes him a suitable candidate now? Has he drastically ramped up on his knowledge of high-tech, Arabic, Middle East? Has he at least gotten a confidence boost? Can one get such a confidence boost in such a short time without completely deluding oneself?  Those I think are questions worth asking. Let me make it clear that I am not attempting to rule on whether or not Porter Goss is a suitable candidate for the position of the DCI. It simply appears that a short while ago he did not consider himself a suitable choice, and the question begs asking, what changed in the interim?

      Etgar Keret, an Israeli author,  urlLink compares  the lofty wordings of an official document, the Israel Defence Force's Code of Ethics, with the reality of a checkpoint in the West Bank. I liked his humorous style. I also like the notion that while it is commendable that the IDF issued such definitive guide as its Code of Ethics, the value of this code will remain questionable until its provisions become every day norms, until it is actually followed and those who violate it are sanctioned.

       David Joseph is a little guy, about 5-foot-5, maybe 115 pounds. He's 20 years old, looks younger, and has the sluggish demeanor and sad expression of one who is deeply depressed. He has nightmares and headaches. He spends his days dressed in the blue fatigues of detainees at the federal Krome Detention Center, washing dishes at mealtimes, staring listlessly at television images broadcast in a language he doesn't understand, and praying. So writes Bob Herbert in his  urlLink New York Times op-ed piece . So why is Mr Joseph behind bars. Well, he is an illegal alien, a boat person from Haiti.         Mr. Joseph is a refugee from Haiti who is seeking asylum in the United States. He is not a terrorist, and no one has even suggested that he is a threat to anyone. And yet he's been in federal custody for nearly two years.     An immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals have ruled that he should be freed on bond, pending a final ruling on his asylum request. But the attorney general of the United States, John Ashcroft, won't let him go.     Playing his ever-present, all-encompassing terrorism card, Mr. Ashcroft personally intervened in Mr. Joseph's case, summarily blocking his release. According to the attorney general, releasing this young Haitian would tend to encourage mass migration from Haiti, and might exacerbate the potential danger to national security of nefarious aliens from Pakistan and elsewhere who might be inclined to use Haiti as a staging area for migration to the U.S.     Let us stop here for a moment and try to take it in. Essentially, what Mr Ashcroft, The Attorney General of the US, is saying is that he is making decisions on David Joseph's case not based upon the merits of the case, or the personal qualities of the detainee, but in order to affect the behaviour of a whole group, in order to penalize a whole group,- namely, current and potential illegal immigrants from Haiti. It appears fair to say that if Mr Joseph were detained in identical circumstances but his country of origin were Greece or China instead of Haiti he would long have been released on bond.    Mr Ashcroft is firm in his belief that this is indeed the way to go. Or at least his dialog with Senator Specter during Mr Ashcroft's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee leaves one with that impression.        Senator Specter urged Mr. Ashcroft to consider a policy in which the Justice Department would address cases like Mr. Joseph's on a less sweeping, "more individual" basis, which would enable officials to determine whether there was any real basis for concern about terrorism.     Mr. Ashcroft was unmoved. He told Senator Specter: "Sometimes individual treatment is important. Sometimes it's important to make a statement about groups of people that come."     Be that as it may, Mr Ashcroft seems to be a proponent of the idea of group responsibility. That idea is contrary to the spirit of the US law. If we as a society want to include that notion in the law, we should do so in an open and honest manner. That principle,- the responsibility of a group for individual's deeds or proclivities,- must be made part of the law through legislative process. Personally, I think that would spell the end of the Constitution and the lawful society in the US as we know it, but back-door attempts to run such practices must most definitely not be allowed.   I have recently expressed my desire to see certain government lawyers  urlLink disbarred . I think we have one more name to add to the list of those lawyers: John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General. I would even honor him with the top spot on that list.

      No sooner did I write my  urlLink comment on New Jersey Governor James McGreevey's resignation  than  urlLink more details  emerged as to the circumstances surrounding it.  Two sources close to McGreevey, both speaking on condition of anonymity, said the man involved in the affair was Golan Cipel, an Israeli poet who worked briefly for the governor as a homeland security adviser despite having no security experience. This is interesting. Well, if Mr Cipel's job as a homeland security adviser was indeed handed to him as a gift from his lover, then maybe Mr McGreevey indeed should resign. As I said before, the criteria should be limited to professional factors,- and hiring somebody who seems a bit underqualified is, to say the least, somewhat unprofessional.  Mr Cipel is also alleged to have blackmailed his lover the Governor by attempting to extort exorbitant amounts of money in exchange for silence. If that is truly the case, then I think Mr Cipel must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

      The news is in,- New Jersey Governor James McGreevey is  urlLink resigning  over a homosexual affair. I think that is wrong. Not his resignation,- I am not in a position to tell whether he should resign or not, this decision is clearly his to make. But the whole situation is wrong.  His sex life is his own business,- and nobody else's. He feels that he has wronged his wife and chooses to apologize to her,- that's fine, in fact, that's admirable. Whether to do so privately or publicly is also his choice. However, that is not a criterion by which his performance as Governor should be judged. Nor is it grounds for resignation.  This sort of precedent diverts attention from the simple fact that there ought to be one and only one measure of our official's performance,- professionalism in their position. Other things, such as looks, sexual deviations (or the lack thereof), religious affiliation,- simply should not matter.  I respect Governor McGreevey for having what it takes to disclose the uncomfortable truth. However, I wish he stayed on the job.

      In modern Russian the prison jargon has become a significant part of many people's vocabulary. Those who use it are not necessarily criminals or ex-inmates,- this linguistic infusion penetrates all layers of the society, from the streets of industrial towns to the corridors of power. And that is an inevitable consequence of mass imprisonment which reached its peak during the years of Stalin's purges and has remained part of Russia's reality to this day. In his world renowned book  GULAG Archipelago  Alexander Solzhenitsyn provides a masterful description of how the world of prisons affects the world on the other side of the fence,- linguistically, culturally, mentally and in many other ways.  In Russian prison jargon "zona" (Russian for "zone") means "prison camp". Thus to a Russian speaker this modern term, "free speech zone", sounds somewhat ironic. I have recently seen the one in Boston next to the Fleet Center, the site of the Democratic National Convention. To a large extent I believe the description of it Dahlia Lithwick provides in her  urlLink New York Times column  to be correct.  The largely ignored "free-speech zone" at the Democratic convention in Boston last month was an affront to the spirit of the Constitution. You may want to take a look at  urlLink these pictures  and see for yourself. Personally, I think these pictures show it in a bit too grim a light,- but not by much. I think Lithwick is also correct in her comments on some sections of the Patriot Act.  One section invented a broad new crime called "domestic terrorism" - punishing activities that "involve acts dangerous to human life" if a person's intent is to "influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion." If that sounds as if it's directed more toward effigy-burning, or Greenpeace activity, than international terror, it's because it is. International terror was already illegal.  My only comment to her above statement would be that all terrorism, whether originating overseas or within the US, had been illegal long before Ashcroft came up with an idea to write the Patriot Act. Furthermore, so has been murder, assault and destruction of property, as well as conspiracy to commit the above-mentioned crimes,- the crimes that pretty much inevitably follow every terror attack.  Specifically regarding the "free speech zones", I must admit to a complete mental failure to comprehend what security objective they accomplish. I tend to think wearing a button or a t-shirt with a certain verbiage on it has not yet stopped anybody from engaging in any sort of violence (unless you believe in amulets, that is). So it is beyond me why, given their prior knowledge of the practice of "free speech zones", an individual or a group planning an act of sabotage would not pose as supporters to get as close as they can to the group or person they seek to harm. And unless those who have instituted the practice come forth with a sensible explanation as to what security benefits it yields, I will continue to view that practice exclusively as that of intimidation, oppression and censorship.

      The warnings keep coming in. The enemy is at the gate,- or even way past the gate. Al Quaeda is seeking ways to terrorize Americans, the want to disrupt the US Presidential Election and drive Bush from office. While the former is likely true, the latter is questionable. As I have  urlLink said  before, George W Bush's chances of being re-elected are more likely to improve than to decrease in case of a major pre-Election terror strike since he has successfully build an image of himself as a war President, and that is the only part of his PR portfolio that appears solid.  In his  urlLink Village Voice article  James Ridgeway also presents another interesting possibility of what Al Quaeda may be up to at the moment:  Robert Killebrew, a retired army infantry colonel who often writes and speaks about defense and national security matters, predicted Sunday in  The Washington Post  that Al Qaeda will plan more attacks on the Madrid model, in which a terrorist act is hooked to a political event in order to accomplish maximum effect. And that while Al Qaeda is bashing Middle East and Western governments it doesn't like, it will also try to gain support of the street Muslims by entering politics and sooner or later putting its own people into high positions within different governments. "If, as I expect," writes Killebrew, "Al Qaeda makes the transition in the coming decade from a deadly, popular but rootless terrorist grouping to the sitting government of a number of countries, this heroic theme will inspire their governing institutions, including regular military and paramilitary forces and will become part of the pan-Arab, anti-crusader tradition." If true, this may actually be good news of sorts. Any movement that transitions from a stateless outlaw group to being part of a government generally tends to become more restrained and responsible. And those who deal with it,- whether friends or enemies,- finally get an address to go to.  Overall, I think the Amercians should for the most part disregard these latest terror warnings and not let them affect their plans for the Election day, or any other day before or after. Those professionally involved in law enforcement and intelligence should of course try to do their job as best they can and try and thwart the terror threat if it is real. All the rest of us should treat that threat as a background noise, like the rumbling of a thunderstorm which may at any time result in a deadly tornado or a bolt of lightning,- but which we do not generally allow to stop our lives in their tracks.  And, yes, I believe they should vote as this is likely the most crucial election in a long time,- and in a long time to come. And those who think that Bush has a strong anti-terror record may want to check out alternative media websites such as  urlLink this one  and think once again whether that is indeed the case.

      We have been there many times before. Perhaps, most famously, in 1994 when the world stood by as  urlLink 800,000 died in Rwanda . Or back in the 1970's when Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia eliminated several millions of their citizens.  And now, a similar tragedy is occurring in Sudan. J. Russell Tyldesley describes numerous reasons for inaction there in his  urlLink Baltimore Chronicle article . As Mr Tyldesley observes,  The UN Security Council resolution is being crafted carefully out of respect for Sudan's sovereignty, according to the US Representative to the United Nations, John Danforth. The US displayed much less concern for the sovereignty of Iraq, despite there being no declared genocide afoot in that unfortunate country. Now we are confronting a situation in Darfur, declared by the US House of Representatives, in a unanimous resolution, to be a genocide which compels us to act under our own laws and a 1948 UN treaty on genocide. The reasons for inaction are many,- divisions between different forces in the world, economic reasons, etc. To top it all off, Mr Tyldesley makes writes,  Sudan alleges a conspiracy against it, citing the example of Iraq. Could it also be that in the wake of the dishonest invasion of Iraq by a fabricated "coalition of the willing," the world community of nations is now paralyzed to inaction for fear of being accused of nefarious motives? Add this to the mounting costs of the Iraq misadventure. What the reasons for any and every such inaction are is a complex question, and there is likely no one answer to it. However, I believe such inaction in the face of such enormous tragedy is a crime, and we all stand responsible for it.

      Officially Kahane Chai (Kach), the Jewish extremist movement based upon the teachings of  urlLink Rabbi Meir Kahane  are outlawed in Israel. In reality, a lot of people,- a minority, but not a negligible minority,- seem to be attracted to his teachings. While it is difficult,- and, in my view, unnecessary,- to outlaw any ideology per se, I think it is both the right and the responsibility of the state to clamp down on any movement that turns its ideology into violent action, or undertakes physical preparation for such action.  Such preparations are underway in Israel now. Kachane Chai  urlLink is training the settler youths in Gaza  in resisting the potential government's attempts to vacate the settlements there. The organizers of this training make no secrets of the goals:   "We are preparing the youths to circumvent army roadblocks, how they should talk to soldiers, and how to navigate in the field," explained right-wing extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is identified with the outlawed Kahane movement. "Everything is for, heaven forbid, a possible attempt to expel Jews from their homes. These youths, and many others who will come to Gush Katif and the Shomron, will say to Ariel Sharon and his accomplices: 'We're not leaving here alive,'" he said. Some of them are using an overtly militant language:    Baruch Ben-Yosef, one of the organizers of the "boot camp," said, "Our goal is to lead the battle against withdrawal. We hope that the youths in the camp will recruit dozens and hundreds of additional youths who will come at the proper time to fight," he said.  I think this is a serious challenge to Israel, and to maintain the rule of law Israel must meet it and not run away for it. I think it is also important to realize that the threat of Jewish extremism, in Israel and elsewhere, is quite real, and in its root nature not much different from that of Arab and Muslim extremist groups, or any other violent extremist groups, for that matter. It may also be the case that it is this Jewish extremism, and not its Palestinian counterpart, that represents the biggest threat to the future of Israel.

      An Israeli Arab couple is  urlLink trying to purchase a home in Karmiel , but the purchase is being thwarted by the  ILA (Israel Land Authority). The reason: they are Arabs. This is racism in its clearest form, and while I am happy to know that Israel's   High Court of Justice ruled such practices illegal, I am completely appalled by the fact that the ILA sees it fit to violate the Court's decisions. Conducting business is every citizen's right, and any authority attempting to subvert this right on racist grounds needs to be stopped!

      The following is a  urlLink speech  by  urlLink Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) . I think with small corrections for the local terms and circumstances, it fully applies to every democracy in which in difficult times citizens face a temptation to give into the government's "just trust us" rhetoric.  Everyone who holds the freedom dear should rejoice over words like the following:   Freedom is not defined by safety.    Freedom is defined by the ability of citizens to live without government interference.    Government cannot create a world without risks, nor would we really wish to live in such a fictional place.    Only a totalitarian society would even claim absolute safety as a worthy ideal, because it would require total state control over its citizens’ lives. This doesn’t stop governments, including our own, from seeking more control over and intrusion into our lives. As one Member of Congress stated to the press last week, “people who don’t want to be searched don’t need to come on Capitol grounds.” What an insult!    The Capitol belongs to the American people who pay for it, not to Congress or the police.   I have read  urlLink Rep. Paul's Congress homepage  and I can't say I support every idea of his. But I think this speech is truly excellent, with it I agree entirely, and it is certainly great news that a man capable of delivering a speech like that is a member of our legislature.

      I have recently commented on  urlLink James L Hart , a man campaigning as a Republican and displaying an outright racist agenda. It looks like he's got company,- a man holding similar views to Hart's when it comes to the Latinos, albeit a man whose breeding Mr Hart is vowing to discourage.   urlLink Vernon Robinson  presents his sentiment as a concern about the "illegal alien invasion". The only thing he seems to get right is the need to make the borders secure. However, his statements about the illegal immigrants filling our prisons and effectively abusing the welfare system sound like pure hatemongering to me. And, just like in the case of Mr Hart, I think the GOP's failure to rescind his membership may be considered a silent approval of such agenda on the part of the party as a whole.

      For the sake of honesty I must declare that I am not unemotional or unbiased in my assessment of George W Bush. I greatly dislike the man. This is not for partisan reasons. There are Republicans whom I like,- for instance, the former Massachusetts Governor William Weld. There is also at least one well-known Republican whom I greatly respect,- Senator John McCain.  As for Bush, I started questioning his basic knowledge of life back in the days when he as Governor of Texas was not only supporting the death penalty full force, but applying it with little apparent consideration of the cases presented before him. He said he believed in the courts; apparently, he took it to mean that the courts would always get it right and hence he could effectively abrogate his oversight responsibility and just let the system proceed.  "If you’re asking me whether or not as to the innocence or guilt or if people have had adequate access to the courts in Texas, I believe they have." -- Response to an AP Reporter (Courtesy  urlLink texecutions.com )   As a result, he had signed 155 death warrants,- according to  urlLink some sources , a record for any executive official in the US history, thereby earning himself a nickname "Texecutioner". According to  urlLink this website , Bush went as far as to mock an inmate requesting clemency:  Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer criticized Gov. George W. Bush for making fun of an executed Texas woman in an interview Bush gave to Talk magazine. "I think it is nothing short of unbelievable that the governor of a major state running for president thought it was acceptable to mock a woman he decided to put to death." Just before her execution date, Tucker appealed for clemency on the grounds that she had become a born-again Christian. Bush's reply: "'Please,' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, 'don't kill me.'" I think this sort of behaviour signifies a complete lack of understanding of the gravity of death. It is common for children to have a weak understanding of how finite death is, how tragic it is regardless of whose death we are talking about. In an adult, that signifies both the lack of understanding of the finality and gravity of death, and the lack of ability to truly appreciate life.  Even given all his shortcomings, I at times wonder if my negative attitude towards George W Bush is truly justified. After all, he is not unique neither in his shortcomings, nor in his achievements. Actually, I take that back,- not everyone gets to be the leader of the world's most powerful country. All that said, I think he is remarkably unfit for his current job.  When I read what he says in interviews,- like  urlLink this one , for instance,- I start feeling more for him as a person. He is demonized in some quarters, and I don't think that is the right way to look at him. In this interview, he comes across as a very incurious and naive man.         HUME: How do you get your news?   			 			   				   			 			 				      BUSH: I get briefed by Andy Card and Condi in the morning. They come in and tell me. In all due respect, you've got a beautiful face and everything.   			 			   				   			 			 				      I glance at the headlines just to kind of a flavor for what's moving. I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who are probably read the news themselves. But like Condoleezza, in her case, the national security adviser is getting her news directly from the participants on the world stage.   			 			   				   			 			 				      HUME: Has that been your practice since day one, or is that a practice that you've...   			 			   				   			 			 				      BUSH: Practice since day one.   			 			   				   			 			 				      HUME: Really?   			 			   				   			 			 				      BUSH: Yes. You know, look, I have great respect for the media. I mean, our society is a good, solid democracy because of a good, solid media. But I also understand that a lot of times there's opinions mixed in with news. And I...   			 			   				   			 			 				      HUME: I won't disagree with that, sir.   			 			   				   			 			 				      BUSH: I appreciate people's opinions, but I'm more interested in news. And the best way to get the news is from objective sources. And the most objective sources I have are people on my staff who tell me what's happening in the world.       So, in his interview with Brit Hume he openly admits that he allows a select group of people to filter everything he hears. Essentially, he admits being manipulated. And the notion of everyone being inevitably subjective,- a notion anyone with the most basic knowledge of human nature is aware of,- seems to completely escape him.  I also at times feel sorry for him. In his family, there does not appear to be much communication going on. In the same interview, Bush paints a picture of a family where his contact with his father is very irregular.  HUME: Tell me one thing. How often do you talk to your dad?  			 			   				   			 			 				    BUSH: You know, probably once every two weeks.   			 			   				   			 			 				    HUME: Really? Because I think a lot of people would imagine that you guys would be in touch constantly.   			 			   				   			 			 				    BUSH: No, I'm in touch constantly -- you mean like in terms of asking him...   			 			   				   			 			 				    HUME: Oh, yeah, calling up, saying, what about the Saudis, you know, you've dealt with them, what about them, and what should I do here, dad? You had a war with Saddam Hussein. What about that? I mean, sort of, you can understand how people would imagine that.   			 			   				   			 			 				    BUSH: No, I can understand. First of all, I talk to him really as son to father. I am worried about the fact that he is worried about me. You know you a very good question, did I take criticism of him or me easier, and the answer is, I take criticism of me easier.    So even though he clearly is not an unconcerned son,- he admits to being worried about his father being subjected to criticism, and it is generally alleged that his father has been a role model for him throughout his whole life,- he does not find much time to communicate with his father.  The Bushes' family relations are clearly none of my business. And,- unlike Bush's staff,- I am subjective. However, the picture I subjectively perceive here is of a very cold family, a family where children do not get to learn how to empathize with others. It also appears that this environment would imbue one with a very stringent and inflexible outlook on the world, such as the one President Bush appears to adhere to.  Every time I read an interview with George W Bush my dislike for the man diminishes. But at the same time I become even firmer in my belief that this is a man completely unfit for any job in which he would be responsible for the well-being of others.

      This is the question many people in the US,- some say, way too many,- have been asking over the last several years. And for some the changes have been drastic indeed,- even grotesquely so. Once in awhile, something hardly believable comes across as news,- such as stories of ex-dot-com yuppies going homeless,- and in this insane world, one tends to believe those stories.  While those who lucked out on dot-com may have had some undeserved luck coming their way, it is clear that they are likely relatively young and on average have provided for themselves sufficiently to weather the storm. Not so for many others, who are older, have family responsibilities, have lost their job, found none (or none that pay nearly as much as the one they lost),- those who silently slip into poverty and hopelessness.  In his  urlLink article  Paul Krugman gives a fairly good overview of the picture. He provides a very good assessment, in my opinion, to what the true result of this administration's tax cuts have been:  What we've just seen is as clear a test of trickledown economics as we're ever likely to get. Twice, in 2001 and in 2003, the administration insisted that a tax cut heavily tilted toward the affluent was just what the economy needed. Officials brushed aside pleas to give relief instead to lower- and middle-income families, who would be more likely to spend the money, and to cash-strapped state and local governments. Given the actual results - huge deficits, but minimal job growth - don't you wish the administration had listened to that advice? Well, as I said time and again, if you want to stimulate the local economy, give the money to anyone who can not hold it for long,- for instance, give it to the homeless and the prostitutes in the street, and that would be far more certain to ensure that the money is spent locally than when you give it to somebody like Warren Buffet or Bill Gates, or even many other people who are less affluent but still affluent enough to invest,- potentially, not even in their own economy.  Returning to the subject of the job situation here,- frankly, I don't have a good handle on it. However, I am not alone here,- the US Department of Labor doesn't either. For instance, unemployment is calculated as a percentage of those who are receiving unemployment assistance or reporting to local labor departments as job seekers. However, for many it has proven so fruitless and frustrating that they stopped even bothering after their unemployment insurance ran out. Some do not collect it for other reasons, thus excluding themselves from the official count. For instance, yours truly is currently unemployed but decided not to collect his unemployment benefits as he is sufficiently wealthy to forgo them. Thus, I did not make the count either.  So, the bottom line is that the situation is fairly grave. The greed, egotism and indifference that permeate the society are likely to only make it worse for those who have fallen into poverty. Our President is alleged to believe that it is their own fault, as he is alleged to say that  "People are poor because they are lazy." (see this  urlLink article ) Well, aside from the first question I would ask,- namely, why is George W Bush not poor,- I can only say that the unemployed should not expect much help from this President. Nor from any other President, though someone who does not make maximizing corporate profits his political objective is likely to improve the situation of those in poverty.  We should all think of them,- when donating to charity, when considering our own financial situation, when shopping. Mainly, we should stop being selfish and come out of our shelter of ignorance. The poor are out there. We can help them,-or we can make them desperate. If it is the latter we choose,- well, let's not be surprised when they show up at our doorstep, a weapon in hand, and take by force what we should have shared.

      We have heard it time and again. The drugs are destroying our communities. Young lives full of promise are snuffed out by the scourge of drug addiction. Vicious gangs force our children into doing their dirty work,- selling drugs on street corners. Young girls are forced into prostitution to support their addiction. We have all seen pictures of cocaine babies. The pundits, the politicians, the executive officials have spoken and told us that this is a plague that must be destroyed. And if it takes a war to eradicate this plague,- so be it, we will fight the war on drugs and we shall prevail.  However, there are different ways to look at it. One perspective would be that some view some drugs considered illegal in the US perfectly safe and even useful. I once met a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan who credits hashish with saving his life as, according to his description, this was a way to get rid of stress and get oneself together without the drunken stupor caused by alcohol. The medical use of marijuana is another area where the drug's positive effects are well documented. Cocaine makes one extra-alert; I suppose there are situations when that could come in handy,- to help an exhausted soldier or firefighter stay focused, for instance. Of course, for drugs to have a positive effect they must be used in moderation, but the same is true of pretty much everything. One needs to just walk the streets of pretty much any US city to see the results of our failure to know moderation when it comes to food consumption.  Another view of the situation is that the drug addicts are sick. They can no longer control their urges, thus they can not be held responsible in a court of law, nor can they be expected to avoid committing crimes if these crimes hold a promise of their next fix for them. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that demand (the addicts) brings supply (the drug dealers) onto the scene. Hence, according to this model, the solution ought to be registration and treatment for drug addicts, with the distribution for those who have not yet been weaned of their drug of choice.  Yet another view,- the one I favor the most,- is that drug use is a matter of personal choice. It should be completely decriminalized. It is officially considered a crime, while, so long as you merely consume drugs you harm no one but yourself. If you commit a crime, whether while intoxicated or not, it is this crime you ought to be prosecuted for. I favor that view. Yes, there are holes in it. Of course a drug addict does not merely harm himself as it is also his family, friends and the community that suffers. But the same is true of a person who eats unhealthy food, incurs heart trouble as a result and dies of a heart attack at a young age. Or of a person who becomes addicted to alcohol,- which is legal.  These views likely do not even begin to represent the whole spectrum. They should suffice to show, however, that the narrow view accepted by several consecutive US administrations is not the only way to look at the picture,- likely, not even the correct way. But let us stop our lofty flight into theory and come back to the reality on the ground. And the picture there ain't pretty. The war on drugs is going apace.  In his recent  urlLink Denver Post article  Walter Cronkite correctly characterizes this war as an utter failure and also correctly notes that,      Much of the nation, in one way or another, is victimized by this failure - including, most notably, the innocents, whose exposure to drugs is greater than ever.   He then goes on to elaborate on the scope of the war, the sheer numbers of those affected,- 500,000 behind bars exclusively for drug offenses. The article is also an excellent summary of how unfair the system is, with, among other things, the lowest-level offenders often getting the toughest sentences as they do not have infromation they could trade for a reduced sentence. As for what is in the works to change this reality, according to Cronkite,    The Alliance [Drug Policy Alliance] and other organizations are working to reform and reframe the war on drugs. And they are finding many judges on their side, who are rebelling against this cruel system. We can expect no federal action during the congressional hiatus in activity ahead of the November elections, but it would be of considerable help if, across the country, campaigning politicians put this high on their promises of legislative action, much sooner than later.   I think this may not be going far enough. We should not reframe the war on drugs,- we should stop it. Those who have committ drug-related violent crime should be prosecuted,- with the war on drugs stopped, murder is still going to be murder, racketeering is still going to racketeering, and both will still remain crimes.  Boris Grebenshikov, one of Russia's leading rock musicians, wrote in one of his songs:  We have been fighting this war for 70 years, They have taught us that life is combat, But the new intelligence report just came in And it turns out all this time we fought ourselves.  ( Translated by me, on the fly ) Well, he said it. Let's just not allow the war on drug to decimate our society for 70 years,- the roughly 20 years we've been fighting it is more than enough. Time to stop the  urlLink madness .

      In a  urlLink news report  that no longer sounds surprising, we read that another racist attack on graves has taken place in France. However, this time it is not only the Jewish graves that have been attacked, but also some Christian and Muslim ones. From this report, one would be inclined to look for a Nazi-type group as perpetrators.  The attackers clearly had some anti-Semitic motives. However, given all the facts, I believe it is wrong to say that anti-Semitism is the only sort of racism to be found in France, or that it is a unique phenomena. It is also wrong to focus only on the anti-Semitic aspect of these attacks the way many Jewish leaders have.  Clearly, for a variety of reasons, there are racist elements in many communities in France. And the amount of healthy outrage those racists' despicable activities bring forth is a hopeful sign that France as a society takes this problem quite seriously and is quite willing to work towards solving it.

      This is a very intriguing   urlLink story  illustrating how human perceptions change, how relationships form, how people perceive their identity.  Tali Fahima, 28,  an Israeli Jewish woman becomes a friend (some sources say, a lover) to  Zakaria Zubeidi, also 28,  a local leader of a Palestinian terror group. She views his group's activities as a legitimate struggle. She is also not a typical leftist and in the last Prime-ministerial election voted for Ariel Sharon, the right-wing Likud candidate.  Her story certainly takes a lot of credence away from those quick to name Jews trying to find common humanity with Palestinian fighters as Leftist crazies and renegade Jews. She appears traditional, if not religious, and states that   she wants to "marry a Jew and build a traditional Jewish home".  She spent time serving as a human shield for her Palestinian friend. Her relationship with him and his colleagues was by no means covert.   Fahima, a Tel Aviv resident who has made frequent visits to the Jenin refugee camp to show her support for Palestinians, was filmed by Channel Two television recently walking with armed Palestinian fugitives and expressing her support for the "Palestinian struggle." She said she was drawn into a platonic friendship with Zubeidi, who is married, due to a curiosity about the militant's unmitigated hatred for Israel.   She has been arrested twice for her activities. She has not been prosecuted. I think Israel has definitely demonstrated impressive restraint in her case, in comparison with the US at least, as I think anyone whose relationship with an Al Quaeda leader was an equivalent of  Fahima's relationship with   Zubeidi would have been treated much more harshly.  But more importantly it demonstrated the complexity of the problem. Some Israelis, even those whose politics are not exactly of the Leftist fringe, seem to be seeing the military action as part of the problem, not of the solution. Those same Israelis also seem to recognize the occupation for what it is,- a highly opressive condition that can not be maintained indefinitely.

      This, in a nutshell, is the question Jacob Sullum is trying to address in his  urlLink Reason article . The article opens with the discussion of Kelly Brownell's book,   urlLink Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry, America’s Obesity Crisis, and What We Can Do About It   (McGraw-Hill). According to Mr Sullum, Mr Brownell is, ironically, quite portly himself, but that is not the main point of the article, just a humourous aside.  According to Mr Sullum, the book comes up with quite a few recommendations as to what the government ought to do to fight the scourge of obesity. Writes Sullum,         The more important question is why any of this is the government’s business. Granted that obesity is a health issue, why is it a  public  health issue? The answer from Brownell and like-minded activists is that the government must rescue consumers -- especially children -- from the environmental forces that make them fat, thereby rescuing taxpayers from the burden of obesity-related medical expenses. They propose to accomplish this mission through a combination of taxes, subsidies, censorship, and regulation. In his book  Food Fight  (co-authored by Katherine Battle Horgen), Brownell says "profound change is necessary." Among other things, the government must "change the basic economics of food," redesign cities so that "times, places, and incentives for people to be physically active [are] engineered into daily life," "prohibit marketing of products to children," "prohibit snack foods and soft drinks from schools," and "prohibit the operation of businesses selling food within a certain distance of schools." If legislatures fail to go along with this agenda, "litigation may be necessary."       The war on fat is the latest manifestation of a collectivist philosophy that says the government has a duty to protect "public health" by discouraging behavior that might lead to disease or injury. It also reflects an anti-capitalist perspective that views people as helpless automatons manipulated into consuming whatever big corporations choose to produce. The anti-fat crusaders want to manipulate us too, but for our own good. They seek to reshape us by reshaping the world.   Jacob Sullum makes a number of convincing arguments as to why the maintenance of one's weight ought to be left up to the individual. I would think that is the right attitude. I think it is legal to fight misrepresentation of products on the part of food manufacturers. I think when a juice manufacturer misstates the sugar content, or when McDonalds fails to inform the public that its French fries are fried in animal fat, that can be cause for litigation. Otherwise, manufacturers are in their right to do what they do best,- make their product and try to market it to the public, and the public must be knowledgeable and responsible enough to know what to consume and when.  I also think it is very dangerous to the society to have governmental intervention in the areas that ought to be controlled by the individual himself. That breeds infantilism and irresponsibility,- the two afflictions from which we already suffer to a significant extent.

      The Bush administration is suddenly discovering Iran's  urlLink various follies . Iran, however, is generally not making any moves that could be interpreted as a direct threat to the US. It is certainly a threat to Israel, as it has stated many times, but in spite of all the Iranian bellicose rhetoric it most likely realizes what it is up against and Israel's nuclear deterrence policy,- unstated but well known,- is more likely than not going to work.  Than why all these severe pronouncements by our administration which stop just short of threatening military action against Iran if that country is not a direct threat to us,- neither in terms of its policy, nor in terms of its capabilities? The pre-election surprise seems, unfortunately, like something the administration is actively considering. And that can in fact help Bush win the election as Americans are less likely to vote a "War President" out of office.

      A new  urlLink film  just came out about the realities of life with the War on Drugs in the background. The main character acts out what is a compilation of different mules' stories. These people facing few prospects at home in Colombia sometimes have little opportunity to advance in life other than by volunteering to fly to the US carrying pellets of drugs inside their bodies.  While there can be different opinions about these mules, it is clear that so long as the situation remains what it is, with the War on Drugs making drug trade such a lucrative business and with such economic privation in many of the drug-producing countries, there will always be plenty of volunteers willing to take a chance for a quick buck. My question to those who still support the War on Drugs would be,- do you have a plan as to how it can be won?

      While Sheldon Richman makes some good points about John Kerry and the Democratic National Convention in his  urlLink FFF commentary , I think he is also wrong on some issues. Fundamentally, I think he is wrong is saying that a divisive campaign would be better right now. A divisive campaign by Democrats is, in my opinion, tantamount to installing Bush in office for the second term. Also I think it is wrong to blame Kerry for making his Vietnam confessions, or for the content thereof. Note that Kerry did not confess to anything that would amount to his going out of his way to commit atrocities in Vietnam. He was saying that the "free fire zone" regulations led to atrocities in which he ended up taking part. That was a fair criticism of the military policy in the field at the time.  I think Mr Richman's point about the tax-eaters being over represented, and tax-payers being underrepresented on the convention floor is a very valid one. As is his point that Kerry should have known better what he was voting for as Senator when he voted to authorize Bush to wage war on Iraq. I think this criticism should have even gone further,- there should be no war started unless Congress formally declares one. Not untill that and many other things happen will we be able to return from the "postconstitutional America", as Mr Richman correctly puts it, to the one that was truly meant to be.

      While this new  urlLink  terror warning  appears less vague than some we have heard, I still tend to question its authenticity. I am not even talking the banal details,- such as a recommendation to be suspicious of persons who are vague about their origin and identity, or those who insist on paying large expenses in cash. Those are classical signs of someone potentially having a nefarious intent, and repeating that truism,- while useful as a reminder,- should hardly even be presented as news. And it is also known that Al Quaeda likes to use large explosive devices, and is interested in any and all vehicles capable of carrying them,- cars, trucks, limos, helicopters, airplanes, etc.  Parts of the warning go back to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other events that by now are well in the past. While parts of the warning potentially pertain to genuine new intelligence, overall it appears more like a historical summary than a genuine new warning. The way it is presented to us, it seems more like a part of the pre-election PR than anything else. It shows that Tom Ridge and his people do not collect their pay for nothing. It also shows that his boss, President Bush, is serious about fighting the terror threat. As various data indicate thus far, this has remained the only sure-bet popularity booster for his administration.

      Terry Nichols, the man alleged to have manufactured the bomb which Timothy McVeigh used to detonate next to  urlLink the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , has been sentenced to  urlLink 161 consecutive life sentences  without a possibility of parole by the Oklahoma State Court in MsAlester, OK. While McVeigh had been sentenced to die in his federal trial for his role in the crime and was executed in 2001, Nichols has been spared the execution. On top of today's Oklahoma state sentence, he is under a federal life sentence as well.  There appears to be a number of  urlLink holes  in the official version of the events that resulted in 168 deaths. Still, let us assume for now that the version of the events offered by the prosecutors is correct. So we have a situation when a man who is responsible for building a device that was destined to be used in a terror attack and to cause mass casualties,- a man who thus was an integral part of that terror attack is spared the death penalty. Another man who merely pulled the lever on the detonator is executed.  That sentencing pattern somewhat arbitrary. It becomes even more arbitrary when contrasted with the death sentence meted out to  urlLink Manny Babbitt , a Vietnam veteran suffering from a severe form of PTSD and various other ailments, physical and mental. His crime was borderline accident,- an assault on an elderly woman during what was most likely a flashback to the war. Mr Babbitt never denied his responsibility, though he claimed,- and I tend to believe him,- that he could never recall the attack. Yet he was sentenced to death and executed.  Other cases abound throughout the US where the evidence was shaky, the extenuating circumstances were plentiful, the victims were just one person,- and yet the defendants were sentenced to die and consequently executed. Against that background, the fact that Nichols,- a man who stands convicted of directly participating in an attack that killed well over a hundred people,- is spared is amongst the strongest arguments I can think of in favor of abolishing the death penalty. Even those who support it in principle should acknowledge that the manner in which it is used in this country is so completely arbitrary as to make it an utterly immoral practice.

      Having spent almost three years working in a government facility, I can probably claim exposure to all possible varieties of stonewalling. You e-mail about issues,- and even months later you are told your e-mails were not read; you talk to a person, they listen and a mere few days later claim complete ignorance of the conversation, even though the person in question is not known to be senile and displays no discernable symptoms of amnesia; you report a problem and are told that the problem does not exist, that all the elaborate proof of it is not relevant, and that you are to believe there indeed is no problem and behave accordingly on orders of some sort of authority; etc, etc, etc. All this was making my life there very dull and professionally unfullfilling; however, that stonewalling threatened only my performance, its result being little more than the waste of several hundred thousand dollars' worth of taxpayers' money,- which in this day and age really is peanuts. My liberty or life were never at stake.  Not so for the prisoners at Guantanamo and their lawyers, as well as their families. According to this  urlLink LA Times article , Salim Gherebi was captured in Afghanistan in February 2002 and ended up in detention in Guantanamo.  As the paper reports,  Gherebi's brother from San Diego hired Yagman in January 2003 to represent the detainee. But lawyer and client have yet to meet, and Yagman believes Gherebi probably doesn't even know he has a lawyer.  Yagman's efforts to force Justice Department lawyers to justify Gherebi's continued imprisonment have provoked a blizzard of paperwork, court motions and foot-dragging. But there's been little progress toward a face-to-face lawyer-client meeting, let alone a hearing on the merits of his case.  Gherebi's case is hardly unique. Lawyers across the country trying to represent Guantanamo clients report that the government is, as one put it, "trying to neutralize the Supreme Court decision."  The Supreme Court ruled in June that attorney-client meetings must be allowed. So, it seems like when faced with an order that even the most unwitting could not claim not to understand, the administration decided to try some high-class stonewalling. And they are so darn good at it, too.  The article also says,  The Pentagon has let a few detainees meet with a lawyer as a goodwill gesture, providing the lawyer agrees to let officials listen in and promises not to ask about conditions of the client's confinement or if he has been abused. However, the government is contesting almost every motion and writ, tying up the cases as it continues to claim, incredibly, that the Guantanamo detainees have no constitutional right of access. At the same time, detainees are pressured to plead their cases before a military panel without the due process guarantees available in federal court, a move some are resisting. I wonder if they can say "inalienable right". That concept applies to the right of detainees to communicate with their attorneys. That right has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. This right is just there,- and it is not for the Pentagon to give or take away.

      Switzerland will tax the products suspected of being imported from the Jewish settlements in Israel,  urlLink AFP reports . This is a fair decision in that it reflects the EU's position that those settlements do not represent Israel proper and that their very legality is questionable,- which I think it is.  However, in the modern world outsourcing is so wide-spread that something labeled "Made in France" could have 60% of the parts manufactured in Malaysia or China, or something made in the US could essentially be assembled there, with all the parts foreign-made. In light of that, this decision by the  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) appears overly simplistic and probably very difficult to enforce.

      According to this  urlLink article  in  urlLink The Sydney Morning Herald  several months before the 1972 Presidential Election President Nixon met with his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to discuss when and how to get out of Vietnam. They basically did not have an intention of winning the war at that point; however, they considered it important that withdrawal not be commenced before the election, so that Saigon would not fall into the North Vietnam's hands all too soon.  This reads like a case study in political cynicism. I think every responsible citizen, those in uniform included, should also try to think of how much weight the upcoming election has in the policy process on Iraq today.

      According to this  urlLink CNN report  the defense for Pfc. Lynndie England would like to put Vice President Cheney on the stand. I believe that request must be honored, as well as those for any other witness, no matter how high a position they happen to occupy. The only reason not to honor it should be the absolute physical impossibility due to an extremely busy schedule. I think campaign speeches and other non-essential activities must be cancelled, if need be, lest that be necessary for the official in question to be able to testify.

      In this  urlLink document , a number of Jewish Israelis state their platform which includes the recognition of the Palestinian right of return, as well as their opposition to Zionism's denial of the Palestinians' claim to the land. I do not fully agree with their vision. For instance, I favor the defensive wall. Its route is certainly debatable, but it is pretty much a known fact by now that the route prevents Palestinian terrorists from reaching their targets in Israel, and that is sufficient justification for its construction.  As for the right of return, I believe that right ought to be granted to those who became refugees in 1948 and possibly to their children. As for other people who were born outside of Israel and have lived there all their lives, and who happen to have some family connections to the original 1948 refugees,- I think their claim to residence in Israel is questionable as it is for most family members of any other refugee group worldwide. But what is critical is that within whatever future borders Israel find itself in everybody be granted equal citizenship rights and citizenship responsibilities. Israel must become a country of all its citizens,- not just Jews.

      As a recent BBC  urlLink report  indicates, traces of Prozac can now be found in the UK's ground water, rivers and lakes. It also gets into drinking water reservoirs and into the water the population drinks.  According to some authorities, the effects of drinking Prozac-laced water are not expected to be noticeable. However, this is a very alarming symptom indeed. We probably do not have a clear picture on what the effects of this are on the wildlife consuming it. We also likely do not know what other drugs are similarly introduced to the environment.  I don't know about the UK, but here in the US the practice of mass medication has taken on an enormous proportion. You are likely to thoroughly surprise your physician if you are over 30-35 years of age and you tell him or her that you are not on any kind of regular medication. Based on what I hear, the situation in the UK and many other developed countries is not drastically different.  I believe we ought to acknowledge the fact that we have entered an era of an unprecedented medical/chemical interference with our lives. That interference affects our bodies and the environment beyond them. I believe a thorough study of this phenomena is in order,- followed by finding and implementing remedies to the unwanted consequences of this phenomena.

      In his  urlLink article  Anthony Gregory makes a number of important points. I certainly agree with him that if suicide bombings of buses or the events of 9/11 are to be considered acts of political terrorism, so must the intentional mass killings of civilians in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Drezden, Leningrad, Rotterdam and many other places whose civilian populations were likewise intentionally eviscerated by various warring parties during the World War II.  It certainly reflects favorably on the US as a society that eventually Americans showed themselves capable of taking a critical view on those events of which they were part such as nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is also true that in today's wars the US attempts to minimize civilian casualties. However, it is worth noting that that is mostly possible due to advances in technologies which have taken military precision to a whole new level.  But I think we need to acknowledge that terrorism is not something that just came out of the blue and plunged us into the "age of terror" on 9/11/2001. Terrorism is a military tactic, it has been used in many wars,- including by us in some of the wars we have fought.

      Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is  urlLink official ,- James L. Hart, a Tennessee Republican, is running for Congress on a platform of which racism is a major component. Should the GOP's failure to rescind his party membership be viewed as tantamount to the party's acceptance of and acquiescence to the honorable gentleman's racist beliefs?

      The author of this  urlLink article  appears in favor of subjecting the media in Israel to constraints of Jewish law, which can and should be considered the same as calling for religious censorship. Most Israelis likely want nothing of the kind. However, there is a small but vocal minority who certainly would favor this sort of approach.

       urlLink The New York Times  has published an interesting  urlLink article  on the circumstances surrounding the arrest in Pakistan of Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, an alleged senior Al Quaeda operative and one of the group's leading communication experts. According to the article, among other things,  A Pakistani man whose arrest provided information about the reconnaissance of financial institutions in New York, Newark and Washington was also communicating with Qaeda operatives who the authorities say are plotting to carry out an attack intended to disrupt the fall elections, a senior intelligence official said Saturday. As usual with this sort of disclosures, few details were made public. It is not clear how many people are involved, how far they had proceeded in their operational planning, how involved or knowledgeable Mr Khan was as far as those plans were concerned. I can easily see him only passing data back and forth as an electronic courier of sorts.  But what if we even assume he was indeed in the most direct way involved in planning an attempt to sabotage the Presidential election by staging a massive terror attack? More likely than not the result of such an attack would be an elevation of President Bush's rating as he will likely do his best to emerge as a strong leader following another major terror attack. If the fact that his ratings went to about 90% from about 45% following 9/11 is any indication, some, possibly less dramatic, increase in his popularity following another terror attack should be expected. Another possibility would be a postponement or an outright cancellation of the election. Under all of those scenarios the chances of George W Bush remaining in charge for some time to come stand to significantly improve. I certainly respect Mr Khan's right to support Bush for President,- it is only the means he is alleged to have chosen to express his support that I have somewhat of a problem with.  However, there is a whole other possibility of what the arrest of Mr Khan signifies. As Max Blumenthal  urlLink notes  in his  urlLink blog , there is a possibility that Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan may be a double-agent arrested at a preset time and later used to create the current spate of terror warnings. If this is indeed the case, that should hardly come as a surprise,- given this administration's record of politicizing and distorting intelligence on a number of occasions.

      Well, this is one weird  urlLink report . So, let me try to get this straight. US troops, apparently,- at least according to the official PR,- risking their lives and fighting a war to liberate an oppressed people are valiantly trying to  urlLink do just that ,- in this instance, trying to stop an abusive (putting it mildly) police force from torturing and maybe killing people who were hastily picked up in the streets as criminal suspects,- but in reality could be just about anybody, a large percentage of them likely innocent of any crime. So an American soldier notices the abuses through an optical sight on his rifle, reports it, his comrades rush to intervene,- something all Americans should be proud of. Then the US military command tells them to stand down and let things proceed as they did before.  Well then,- we could've just left Saddam running things. Under him, the same sort of abuse was proceeding apace. Or are the new thugs somehow more enlightened?

      This nice little  urlLink chart , courtesy  urlLink The New York Times , illustrates what improvements in "homeland security" could have been made with the money invested in the Iraq war. From the very start of our overseas operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere I questioned the Bush administration's assertion that security at home can be achieved by crushing the enemy abroad. Let us not get into how well that enemy is chosen. Let us look at the bigger picture.  I think it is not a bad idea to at times actually strike at an enemy who is easily identifiable. One, of course, must have the plan that goes beyond a mere attack,- unlike what we appear to have done in Afghanistan where rebuilding efforts don't seem to amount to much. But, to reiterate, military action is a legitimate tool in addressing the issue of terrorism,- but it is not the only tool, likely, not even the most important one.  And I think the real-world events are proving the skeptics right here. Approximate as they are, the figures in this chart illustrate that we likely could have made a very significant progress in creating real obstacles that future terrorists would be facing here at home while there does not seem any positive security effect from the war in Iraq. Also note that the measures this chart details such as surveillance at ports and improved community policing bring real security improvements to the US without eviscerating the Bill of Rights and annihilating the Americans' civil liberties the way this administration is attempting to.

      According to various major media reports quoting high level US government officials as well as US government official documents, on the same day when US Attorney General John Ashcroft received a briefing that stated that Al Quaeda was preparing for an imminent attack on the United States Mr Ashcroft apparently refused to discuss the issue of terrorism with the then-acting FBI Director Tom Pickard. The date:  urlLink July 12, 2001 , just under two months before the attacks of 9/11. And if all of that is true, the fact that Mr Ashcroft still has his job belongs towards the top of the list of major mysteries of our times.

      I have already  urlLink talked  about the US government lawyers who had written memos that authorized human rights abuses including the now notorious use of torture at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. But what about the  urlLink medical professionals  who were part of such abuses? I believe they should be treated similarly,- take they licenses away for the rest of their lives. The message should be stark and clear: you've got to choose whether you want to be a doctor or a nurse, or you want to be a torturer; you just can't be both.

      The warriors of the US Armed Forces, people who have volunteered to defend the US, often find themselves a long way from home, in places such as South Korea, Germany, Kosovo and many others where they are neither fighting in a war, nor directly contributing to the security of the US. As Charles V. Peña says in  urlLink his  Reason  article ,          The Cold War is over and Europe no longer faces the threat of Soviet tanks rolling across the Fulda Gap. And the combined economies of the European countries are healthy and strong enough for Europeans to pay for their own security requirements. In 2003, the EU's GDP was $11.6 trillion and U.S. GDP was $10.9 trillion, but America spent 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense compared to only 1.5 percent for the Europeans.          The North Korean threat to South Korea remains real but, like the Europeans, the South Koreans can afford to pay for their own defense. According to the CIA, "North Korea, one of the world's most centrally planned and isolated economies, faces desperate economic conditions." North Korea's GDP in 2003 was $22.9 billion with defense spending of $5.2 billion (22.7 percent of GDP). By comparison, South Korea's GDP was $855.3 billion (more that 37 times that of the North) with $14.5 billion for defense (almost three times the North and only 1.7 percent of GDP). So South Korea has both the economic advantage and capacity to to defend itself.     From this it appears that the US is effectively lending their soldiers to serve as other nations' surrogate armies, even though the said nations are well capable of furnishing first-rate armies of their own. That may be magnanimous, but certainly is outside of the scope of what the Department of Defense is tasked with doing, namely, providing military defense for the US.    Some view US troops' presence is some places where they have been deployed for a long time a tradition that for diplomatic reasons can not be rejected. Pena very ably counters this argument stating,   The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in the Clinton administration, Richard Holbrooke, said: "I know the Germans are very unhappy about these withdrawals. The Koreans are going to be equally unhappy." But U.S. military forces do not exist to make friends and allies happy. They exist to defend the United States against external military threats. If those threats no longer exist, then the requirement to deploy those forces is also non-existent.  The leading figures of the current administration are also major participants in  urlLink The                Project for the New American Century , an organization advocating for the unchallenged global American domination of the world in the 21st century. I believe their desire is none other than to turn America into a global empire. They are certainly entitled to their ideas; however, they may not, as US government officials, put those ideas into practice when the said ideas are constitutionally illegal. Says Pena,  President Bush's announcement about reducing U.S. troop deployments in Europe and South Korea by as many as 70,000 soldiers is a long overdue decision. As Bush said: "The world has changed a great deal, and our posture must change with it." But the Pentagon has emphasized that "this is not a troop cut or a force structure reduction in the armed forces. It is a realignment globally of U.S. forces and capabilities." In other words, it's simply rearranging pieces on the chessboard. And there are many indications that this realignment is set in motion only the better to realize ideas of  urlLink The                Project . But instead we need to go back to basics and make sure that what our government is doing is what it is obligated to be doing,- nothing more, nothing less. And empire building is not part of what the US government is tasked with,- thus it should not be allowed to proceed down that path.

      Self-criticism is always healthy, and I am happy the  urlLink  The Washington Post   and  urlLink  The New York Times   have found it in themselves to  urlLink acknowledge  that during the run-up to the war in Iraq they did not publish enough information challenging the US officialdom's assertions about that country. The question now is, why did that happen? I think part of the problem is the immense pressure from, and dependence upon the government and corporate powers of the major media sources. They need advertisement, they need access, they need to be the ones to whom government leaks are made. All of the above is all the more reason to have more confidence in the alternative news sources. A lot of those sources are web-based, need little cash to operate and are really far more independent, even if they are severely lacking as far as their information collecting capabilities.

      "Friendly fire" is an unfortunate part of pretty much any war. The fog of battle sometimes leads to soldiers firing on fellow soldiers wearing the same uniform. All of the world's militaries work towards developing procedures to avoid such tragic and wasteful mistakes but none have thus far completely succeeded in this quest.  However, according to  urlLink  Body of Secrets  , a book authored by the investigative journalist James Bamford, in the 1960's the US military considered attacks on Americans disguised to appear perpetrated by the Cuban forces. The objective: convincing the American public of a necessity of going to war with Cuba. As David Ruppe writes in  urlLink his ABC News article ,   Code named  Operation Northwoods , the plans reportedly included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and even orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. That was not merely a thought that popped up in some general's head early in the morning after having a few too many drinks at an Officers' Club the night before. That appears to have been a detailed set of military plans.  America's top military brass even contemplated causing U.S. military casualties, writing: "We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba," and, "casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation." ...   The Joint Chiefs even proposed using the potential death of astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbit as a false pretext for war with Cuba, the documents show.      Should the rocket explode and kill Glenn, they wrote, "the objective is to provide irrevocable proof … that the fault lies with the Communists et all Cuba [sic]."     Fortunately, none of those fiendish ideas were to become reality as they were rejected by the Kennedy administration.    Many Americans think that no one in a position of power in the US would ever even contemplate intentionally harming his fellow Americans in order to create a pretext for promoting their agenda. That assertion appears to have little foundation. Some pretty powerful people within the defense apparatus are  urlLink clearly documented  to have been thinking along the same lines as those at many other times and in many other places throughout history who had intentionally attacked their own populace in order to convince the public of the perceived enemy's aggressive intents.

      Alan Keyes is  urlLink apparently  in favor of repealing the 17th Amendment and reverting to the schema used until 1913 when Senators where not directly elected by the populace but rather appointed by state legislatures. In these times of the non-stop attempts by the federal government to centralize its power and decrease the rights and powers of the states concern about states' rights is fully justified. And while I don't have an opinion one way or the other about the senatorial elections, the fact that a figure of the stature of  urlLink Alan Keyes  is concerned about the matter is certainly welcome news.

      In this  urlLink slightly confusing article , the CNN reports that a man who was convicted of a crime he did not commit using testimony extracted under torture has been released from prison after serving 40 years of his life sentence. I call it confusing because I am not sure how a Texas inmate could have kept escaping from other states' prisons.  Many times he escaped from facilities in other states -- including South Carolina, Louisiana and Mississippi -- only to be recaptured each time. He was returned to the Texas prison system last year. Be that as it may, I am happy Robert Carroll Coney is finally a free man. However, the questions linger. Questions such as, how many people like him are still behind bars? What percentage of cases does our system of criminal justice mishandle? How many true criminals walk free as a result of somebody else taking the heat for what they did?

      The kids were told they were being treated from ringworms. In reality, they were being given a dose of X-rays  35,000  times the allowed maximum. That happened in Israel in 1951 and was funded by the US government. The objective: to conduct an experiment in order to see the effects of X-ray radiation. Sensational? Definitely. But the film about this, as reported  urlLink here  by  urlLink  Israelinsider  , has been shown on the Israeli TV and has already earned significant acclaim in that country.   "The Ringworm Children" (translated in Hebrew as "100,000 Rays"), directed by David Belhassen and Asher Hemias, recently won the prize for "best documentary" at the Haifa International film festival, and in the past year has made the rounds of Jewish and Israeli film festivals around the world. The film shows the baselessness of any potential claims that highest-ranking Israeli officials at the time did not know about this experiment.      Every Sephardi child was to be given 35,000 times the maximum dose of x-rays through his head. For doing so, the American government paid the Israeli government 300 million Israeli liras a year. The entire Health budget was 60 million liras. The money paid by the Americans is equivalent to billions of dollars today. ...   David Deri, on film and then as a panel member, relates the frustration he encountered when trying to find his childhood medical records. "All I wanted to know was what they did to me. I wanted to know who authorized it. I wanted to trace the chain of command. But the Health Ministry told me my records were missing." Boaz Lev, the Health Ministry's spokesman chimes in: "Almost all the records were burned in a fire."  We are told that a US law in the late '40s put a stop to the human radiation experiments conducted on prisoners, the mentally feeble and the like. The American atomic program needed a new source of human lab rats and the Israeli government supplied it. Here was the government cabinet at the time of the ringworm atrocities:  Prime Minister - David Ben Gurion; Finance Minister - Eliezer Kaplan; Settlement Minister - Levi Eshkol; Foreign Minister - Moshe Sharrett; Health Minister - Yosef Burg; Labor Minister - Golda Meir; Police Minister - Amos Ben Gurion.  The highest ranking non-cabinet post belonged to the Director General of the Defence Ministry, Shimon Peres.  That a program involving the equivalent of billions of dollars of American government funds should be unknown to the Prime Minister of cash-strapped Israel is ridiculous. Ben Gurion had to have been in on the horrors and undoubtedly chose his son to be Police Minister in case anyone interfered with them.   Sometimes Jews are viewed as a monolithic group. Many non-Jews believe that they always support each other, and that it is only against non-Jews that they ever discriminate. Clearly, such perception is not always correct. It appears clear from this documentary that only Sephardi Jewish children were selected for the experiment.    David Deri makes the point that only Sephardi children received the x-rays: "I was in class and the men came to take us on a tour. They asked our names. The Ashkenazi children were told to return to their seats. The dark children were put on the bus."   This atrocity is something Israel as a society must get to the bottom of. This is a difficult page in its history, but sweeping it under the rug is not the way to go.  And I am definitely adding this film to my "to see" list.

       Our ingrained American distrust of concentrated power has very little to do with the character or persona of the individual who wields that power. It is the power itself that must be constrained, checked, dispersed and carefully balanced, in order to ensure the survival of freedom.  So says Al Gore in his well-worded  urlLink June 24th, 2004 speech . I am glad he gets the point. I am also pretty sure that this is precisely the point our current administration doesn't get.  I am far from idealizing the USA that the Founding Fathers created,- at the time they created it. For one thing, the country were ideals of equality were proclaimed had a large population of slaves deprived of most rights. But it is precisely the point that implementation of principles recorded in the Constitution, idealistic as they may be, is precisely what we should work towards, not abandon.  Gore was for a long time timid in his criticism of the administration. He did it in a controlled, round-about way. That time seems to be over,- which in my opinion is all for the better.  ...President Bush and Vice President Cheney have decided to fight to the rhetorical death over whether or not there's a meaningful connection between Iraq and al-Qaida. They think that if they lose that argument and people see the truth, then they'll not only lose support for the controversial decision to go to war, but also lose some of the new power they've picked up from the Congress and the courts, and face harsh political consequences at the hands of the American people. As a result, President Bush is now intentionally misleading the American people by continuing to aggressively and brazenly assert a linkage between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein.  If he is not lying, if they genuinely believe that, that makes them unfit in battle with al-Qaida. If they believe these flimsy scraps, then who would want them in charge? Are they too dishonest or too gullible? Take your pick.  There is one thing that Bush and his people are good at,- not allowing reality to get in their way. As Gore put it,  So when the bipartisan 9/11 commission issued its report finding "no credible evidence" of an Iraq-al-Qaida connection, it should not have caught the White House off guard. Yet instead of the candor Americans need and deserve from their leaders, there have been more denials and more insistence without evidence. Vice President Cheney insisted even this week that "there clearly was a relationship" and that there is "overwhelming evidence." Even more shocking, Cheney offered this disgraceful question: "Was Iraq involved with al-Qaida in the attack on 9/11? We don't know." He then claimed that he "probably" had more information than the commission, but has so far refused to provide anything to the commission other than more insults.  The President was even more brazen. He dismissed all questions about his statements by saying "The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al-Qaida, because there was a relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida." He provided no evidence.  And I guess they are certainly entitled to their opinions, and opinions are subjective, and I welcome their right to express their opinions. Personally, I would prefer if they did so as private citizens, and hopefully come January 2005 they will become exactly that.  Gore may have given a bit of a short shrift to the issue of media censorship in the post-9/11 America,- or self-censorship, which in the final run amounts to pretty much the same thing. However it is welcome news that he raised the issue.  Dan Rather says that post-9/11 patriotism has stifled journalists from asking government officials "the toughest of the tough questions." Rather went so far as to compare administration efforts to intimidate the press to "necklacing" in apartheid South Africa, while acknowledging it as "an obscene comparison." "The fear is that you will be necklaced here (in the U.S.), you will have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck," Rather explained. It was CBS, remember, that withheld the Abu Ghraib photographs from the American people for two weeks at the request of the Bush administration.  Overall, this was a good speech

      In his  urlLink article , Jacob G. Hornberger considers the legality of the newly-minted status of "enemy combatant" which the US government has been using to define terror suspects whom it claims it can detain indefinitely without any oversight by the court system. The recent Supreme Court decisions have to some extent undermined the government's contention.  urlLink Mr Horberger  presents a review of various legal aspects associated with these decisions as well as of the "war on terror" in general.  These cases are a critical test of the American system of checks and balances. It is worth noting that two of the cases, namely those of Padilla and Hamdi, involve US citizens. The government's claim to bypass the court system in those cases,- the claim largely annulled by a recent Supreme Court ruling,- amounted to nothing less than a claim to hold any American in custody, potentially incommunicado, when the government saw fit.

       urlLink Alan Dershowitz  has in the past come up with many ideas, some of them highly controversial. One of them was  urlLink advocating the use of torture  as an interrogation technique to be used on terrorism suspects.  He has now come up with  urlLink a new idea ,- a modification to the international law that would allow US or Israel to preemptively strike Iran's nuclear facilities in order to stop that country from obtaining nuclear weapons. Says Dershowitz,  Israel, with the help of the United States, should try everything short of military action first: diplomacy, threats, bribery, sabotage, targeted killings of individuals essential to the Iranian nuclear program and other covert actions. But if all else fails, Israel, or the United States, must be allowed under international law to take out the Iranian nuclear threat before it is capable of the genocide for which it is being built.  And I am a little troubled by what he is saying. Firstly, it sounds like only Israel or the US are even part of the discussion. What about Turkey, for instance, which faces massive radioactive fallout lest a nuclear exchange between Iran and Israel take place? I think Turkey would have every right to consider the possibility of such an event a security threat to itself in its own right.  But that is a side point. While I am not against the idea of preemption in general, I think if such preemption were to be legal under the international law, it must be approved by the international community. And no, I don't necessarily mean the UN,- that organization likely has to be replaced by a more representative body. The UN as it is happens to be a largely disfunctional body, and most of its members do not have representative governments. However, I don't believe that any one party can decide when preemption is appropriate as that would open the door to highly biased interpretations of threats.  On top of that, it sounds like the international law as it exists may in fact be sufficient, contrary to what Dershowitz is saying, as a country is allowed preempt an imminent threat an imminent threat,- which was Israel's justification for starting the 1967 Six Day War. So, what Dershowitz appears to be saying is that preemption must be allowed when just the party about to conduct the preemptive strike in question feels that is necessary. I think that is not a way to go as that party can not possibly be unbiased.  I am also troubled by the fact that Dershowitz is only concerned with two countries when it comes to the threat of a nuclear strike,- Israel and the US. Like I said before, the radioactive fallout knows no geographical boundaries. The fate of a whole area around the site of a potential nuclear strike is bound to be severely affected. And it is hardly in anybody's interest to allow a regional nuclear war,- not to mention the fact that such a war is very likely to escalate into a global nuclear conflict and the end of the civilization.

      This is the title of  urlLink an article  that is making rounds through on the web. It pretty much consists of a collection of curious facts concerning the alleged leader of the 9/11 hijackers. If he truly played that role, whatever else can be said about him, I personally hope that hell exists,- if not for everybody, then for him personally, and that he is securely situated there for millions of years to come.  However, the point I was trying to make was not theological, but rather practical. The facts listed in the article may or may not check out, but the fact that some sources, such as  urlLink this one , report harassment of witnesses by the federal agents in an attempt to silence them... well, that's intriguing, to say the least. If there is truth to what Daniel Hopsicker is saying, it may well turn out that both Mohamed Atta and the operation of which he was a leader were not exactly what the official 9/11 reports would have us believe.  I am not convinced there is truth to the reports by Mr Hopsicker. However, as I have said before, there are  urlLink reasons to be very skeptical  about the official 9/11 Commission report. Thus examining alternative theories is not a sign of madness, but that of healthy curiosity.

      I could not find the source for  urlLink this story . Nor does it seem to be duplicated anywhere. But if it is true, it is an outrage that should not be swept under the rug. Instead, Israeli authorities must find and prosecute those responsible.

      Sibel Edmonds is a former FBI translator who has a lot to say. She would say more if she weren't gagged by the US Department of Justice. Even what she  urlLink managed to say  should arouse your curiosity if truth about 9/11 and our counter-terrorism efforts is of interest to you.  Daniel Hopsicker is a journalist whom I tend to view with some skepticism. Maybe, it is just me, but he seems to have too much of a knack for finding lots and lots of sensational connections,- some of which I tend to think don't amount to much. You can find various publications of his  urlLink here . However, in  urlLink this article of his , he may be on to something. In the article Sibel Edmonds is quoted extensively and the content seems to match things Edmonds either does not know, or is not allowed to properly describe.  I have read a number of publications both describing Edmonds and authored by her. I have written about her before (follow these links: urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ). I believe her to be credible. She may be given to exaggerating facts, she may be bitter, but I do not believe that she is given to either lying or hallucinating. While a lot of facts are still missing, I believe that the story of Sibel Edmonds is an important one, the one to stay on and follow. And, like I said before, what Daniel Hopsicker is describing may indeed be factually correct,- and directly related to Edmonds' disclosures.

      Well,  urlLink Jason Leopold  for one seems to think so. He has authored  urlLink this article  on the subject where he compares what Richard Cheney did while at Haliburton to what  urlLink Ken Lay did at Enron . I think Mr Leopold is certainly making some valid points. Part of  urlLink Mr Leopold's article  is based on a Newsweek article that can be found  urlLink here .

      Since we as a species came up with the idea to form a society (not such a hot idea, I tend to sometimes think) some of us have done better than others in terms of wealth and privilege. The society has continually progressed (or regressed, some might opine) but it has certainly kept changing. Things are now quite complex, and it times it's hard to say exactly how many goodies we've actually got.  Here is a  urlLink very educational site  on the wealth distribution in today's America. You may agree or disagree with what you find there, but I hope it makes you ponder upon what's going on.

       Before attending a rally to hear vice president Dick Cheney, citizens in New Mexico were required to sign a political loyalty oath approved by the Republican national committee. "I, [full name] ... do herby [sic] endorse George W Bush for reelection of the United States." The form noted: "In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush." This, according to an  urlLink article  by Sidney Blumenthal, is the standard protocol at the Bush/Cheney '04 Campaign events. And there is some logic to it,- after all, if you are not a supporter, why are you wasting your time and taking up somebody else's space in the audience anyhow?  Bush is campaigning at events billed as Ask President Bush. Only supporters are allowed in. Talking points are distributed to questioners. In Traverse City, Michigan, a 55-year-old social studies teacher who wore a Kerry sticker had her ticket torn up at the door. "How can anyone in the US deny someone entry?" she asked. "Isn't this a democracy?" I had lots of fun reading Sydney Blumenthal's piece,- I liked both the style or writing and the content. However, the engineer in me is always looking for ways to optimize things. So, it just occurred to me that the process can be considerably streamlined. Why just distribute the questions and "talking points", why stop at that? I think the detailed list of responses to those "talking points" should also be prepared in advance. It can then be distributed to those who signed the "support form" (see above). Maybe, it can even be posted on the web for the reading pleasure of those who would prefer not to sign that form (myself included). Though, come to think of it, maybe it is a better idea to keep those responses unavailable to non-supporters,- no need for us the uninitiated to see. Plus, there is some attractiveness to the mystique, isn't there?  I like this idea of mine. If nothing else, it will enable the President and Vice President to save themselves lots of travel time. It will also save their supporters some time and maybe some money, too (I don't know if one has to pay for admission to those events).

      ...But now it is becoming an increasingly dangerous one. Well, in a way it always has been. Doctors go to front lines of wars, they have to sometimes treat patients who are dangerous due to their psychological problems, they may be robbed at gun point by drug addicts or attacked by aggrieved relatives who rightly or wrongly believes that a medical malpractice has taken place. However here in the US a new danger is now becoming part of their reality,-  urlLink federal agents arresting and charging them  with drug offenses for prescribing narcotic substances to alleviate their patients' pain.  I  urlLink believe  the "War on Drugs" is wrong. In her  urlLink  Reason   article, Maia Szalavitz brings up many important points showing how doctors are hamstrung by drug regulations, how lives and careers are wasted through this infamous "War", how little positive effect can be expected from the policies behind it. This is an outrage, and it is long overdue to be stopped.

       urlLink This  is what Ron Reagan has to say about  urlLink his father 's Vice President's son, our current President George W Bush. Clearly, Reagan Jr is not an unbiased party as his close relationship with his father could not have possibly allowed him not to form certain political and personal perceptions. Come to think of it, no one is completely unbiased when it comes to things about which they have strong feelings.  However, I think Ron Reagan offers an impressively clear-headed review of what this administration is about. Certain observations of his certainly ring true. I could quote almost the entire article here, so relevant and reasonable it sounds. It lists various lies the administration told us; of course, they are not unique in that regard as lies are an integral part of politics. But Reagan believes there is a difference here between the administration of George W Bush and other administrations:   ALL ADMINISTRATIONS WILL DISSEMBLE, distort, or outright lie when their backs are against the wall, when honesty begins to look like political suicide. But this administration seems to lie reflexively, as if it were simply the easiest option for busy folks with a lot on their minds. While the big lies are more damning and of immeasurably greater import to the nation, it is the small, unnecessary prevarications that may be diagnostic. Who lies when they don't have to? When the simple truth, though perhaps embarrassing in the short run, is nevertheless in one's long-term self-interest? Why would a president whose calling card is his alleged rock-solid integrity waste his chief asset for penny-ante stakes? Habit, perhaps. Or an inability to admit even small mistakes. Reagan makes a compelling case for his arguments. Towards the end, he summarizes,   GEORGE W. BUSH PROMISED to "change the tone in Washington" and ran for office as a moderate, a "compassionate conservative," in the focus-group-tested sloganeering of his campaign. Yet he has governed from the right wing of his already conservative party, assiduously tending a "base" that includes, along with the expected  Fortune  500 fat cats, fiscal evangelicals who talk openly of doing away with Social Security and Medicare, of shrinking government to the size where they can, in tax radical Grover Norquist's phrase, "drown it in the bathtub." That base also encompasses a healthy share of anti-choice zealots, homophobic bigots, and assorted purveyors of junk science. Bush has tossed bones to all of them—"partial birth" abortion legislation, the promise of a constitutional amendment banning marriage between homosexuals, federal roadblocks to embryonic-stem-cell research, even comments suggesting presidential doubts about Darwinian evolution. It's not that Mr. Bush necessarily shares their worldview; indeed, it's unclear whether he embraces any coherent philosophy. But this president, who vowed to eschew politics in favor of sound policy, panders nonetheless in the interest of political gain. As John DiIulio, Bush's former head of the Office of Community and Faith-Based Initiatives, once told this magazine, "What you've got is everything—and I mean everything—being run by the political arm." I especially agree with the notion that all the activities of this White House have become highly politicized,- in fact, so much so as to make professionalism next to impossible in many key areas of the governmental activities, such as intelligence, financial planning, environmental management and others.  I am thoroughly impressed by this Ron Reagan's  urlLink piece . Kudos to  urlLink  Esquire   for publishing it. I have just done a  urlLink Google  search to see if anybody else has published this article and found some reprints in the alternative media but none in the mainstream. Which, in my humble opinion, is a shame.

       urlLink Sydney Schanberg  certainly is talking from experience when it comes to war. He was in Vietnam and Cambodia. The award-wining movie,  urlLink  The Killing Fields  , is based on the true story of  urlLink Sydney Schanberg , a  New York Times  reporter at the time, and  urlLink Dith Pran , a Cambodian journalist who worked as an interpreter for Shanberg, in Cambodia during the time directly preceding the rise of  urlLink Pol Pot  to power in Cambodia. Dith Pran was trapped in the nightmare of Cambodian genocide, while Shanberg spent years trying to save his friend's life.   urlLink Here  is what Mr Schanberg has to say about how Vietnam relates to the current events,- both in Iraq and in the US. I think it is definitely worth a read.

      This is a  urlLink documentary  about the alleged massacre of the Taliban POWs who had surrendered to the Northern Alliance troops in 2001 at Kunduz. According to this documentary, US troops participated in the massacre.  urlLink  Democracy Now!   claims to be the only TV channel to air this controversial film even though it  urlLink was viewed  by a significant audience worldwide.  The film was directed by  urlLink Jamie Doran  who  urlLink claims  to have been directly told him that the film will never see the light of day in the US.  Jamie Doran says of State Department official Larry Schwartz, “Larry said and I quote directly, ‘You have to understand, we’re involved, we’re in touch with the national [newspapers] on a daily basis – this story won’t run, even if it’s true.’” And television industry insiders told Doran, “not now Jamie.” Well, they were wrong,- thanks to the efforts of  urlLink  Democracy Now!   and  urlLink  Information Clearing House  . Unfortunately, they were right about the mainstream media who to the best of my knowledge never even mentioned the film's existence. However, you can watch it now, and I highly recommend it as we must know the truth no matter how difficult it may be.

      Benedict LaRosa, a historian, writer and policy advisor to The Future of Freedom Foundation, offers  urlLink an interesting view  on the effects of gun control on our ability to defend ourselves against the terrorist attacks. I am not as much of a gun rights supporter as Mr LaRosa,- I believe, for instance, that weapons must be registered and only issued to those who are qualified to use them,- however, I support many ideas of his. For instance, the notion of point defense versus area defense, the former being far more effective against an elusive enemy such as a team of terrorists certainly appeals to me.  It is certainly a good idea to have armed militias. That allows citizens to be able to actively participate in defending their communities, from all those who threaten it,- be they local criminal gangs or terror groups. As LaRosa puts it,  Instead of hamstringing people with a myriad of gun-control measures, governments at all levels should encourage them to arm and train themselves. Funds for homeland security would thus be better spent, American military and security forces relieved of an impossible task, and homeland security enhanced. He also makes good sense when he says:  If citizens were free to procure whatever firearms they desired without interference from government, as they should be, then the owners and occupiers of homes and businesses could provide their own high level of security using whatever weapons they considered appropriate, such as submachine guns. Government forces could then concentrate their limited resources in manpower, funds, and equipment to seek out and destroy the terrorists without having to worry about guarding every possible static structure a terrorist might attack. I certainly have some reservations about combat weapons such as submachine guns or machine guns being readily available,- I think people need to first be trained to use them. However, those trained and organized in a militia should be able to have them,- after all, they do have a vested interest in protecting their property and lives of their family, friends and co-workers, and there is no way police forces can be everywhere at all times.  I both enjoy weapons and fear them. But the fact of life is that there are situations when one needs a weapon for defense, and that is especially true when the threat comes not from a mugger who is likely to merely use his weapon to intimidate you, but from a terrorist who is trying to kill as many people as possible. The potential victims of terror have a stark choice,- to die or to fight back. Personally, I favor the latter.  As the saying goes, "When guns are outlawed, only outlaws have guns". That seems true,- and that is not how things ought to be. The good guys should have guns too,- let's keep the outlaws guessing which one of their victims is about to be a nasty surprise for them.

      I already  urlLink mentioned  William Krar here. He is  urlLink reported  to be mighty frustrated that his efforts notwithstanding, the media denied him due attention. You know, for once I agree with him. This is certainly a case of clear-cut discrimination if there ever was one.  urlLink Jose Padilla  did not even have to have a half-usable plan for an attack, never mind a whole arsenal of equipment to be honored with an announcement in a press conference by John Ashcroft himself,- from Moscow, at that. And poor Mr Krar, through his misfortune of being White and not even remotely associated with Al Qaida, has to while away his days in a clink without so much as a newspaper with his mug shot. What can I say,- ain't no justice in this here world. Maybe good ol' Billy Krar ought to sue the Fox News?

      Well, you probably heard the name. The man is an Arab born in the US to Saudi parents, and thus an American citizen. He was captured is Afghanistan, became a POW (or an "enemy combatant", in the modern parlance), but since technically he was a US Citizen he ended up not in Guantanamo but in a naval brig prison in South Carolina. An August 16  urlLink  Los Angeles Times  report  states,  The government ... told a federal appeals panel in June 2002 that "Hamdi's background and experience, particularly in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, suggest considerable knowledge of Taliban and Al Qaeda training and operations." In short, at some point in the not so distant past Mr Hamdi was considered a dangerous person, an Al Qaida operative with the extensive knowledge of his organization, someone who was too dangerous to be tried in the US Court system,- clearly, someone with a potential to do great damage should he ever be released.  However, times change. And sometimes the changes are nothing short of radical.  Now, it seems, the government is negotiating with Hamdi's attorneys for his release from confinement. According to reports, Hamdi would renounce his U.S. citizenship, move to Saudi Arabia and accept some travel restrictions, as well as some monitoring by Saudi officials, in exchange for his freedom. In addition, he may have to agree not to file a civil rights lawsuit against the federal government.          If all Hamdi has to worry about is going forward into his new life of freedom, it would be a remarkable turnaround for a man who for years now the government has sworn is a terrorist. It would be a shocking admission from the government that there is not now, and probably never has been, a viable criminal case against Hamdi. And it would cause a stunning and long-lasting loss of credibility for the representations that government lawyers and military officials make in these sorts of terror law cases.  Wow, he seems like not such a bad guy after all. Maybe, we should even apologize to him for holding him in prison for over two years. Oh, I guess I forgot that apologies are not part of the "War on Terror".  The Justice Department is spinning the talks between Hamdi's attorneys and federal lawyers as a routine exercise in the release of prisoners in wartime. But it is fairly clear that such talks did not take place before the Supreme Court rode to Hamdi's rescue a couple of months ago by requiring his captors to give him some rights.  So, did the government properly investigate the matter and finally realize that there was no case here? Possibly, but somewhat unlikely if what Andrew Cohen reports in  The LA Times  is true.  Cohen also compares the treatment of Hamdi to that of John Walker Lindh, another American captured in Afghanistan and currently serving a twenty year term in a federal penitentiary. Note that "unlike Hamdi, Lindh was never deemed an enemy combatant". A very apt comparison, I must note.  Says Cohen of the Hamdi affair,  This isn't supposed to happen in a nation ruled by law.  I certainly could not agree more.

      Christian Parenti wrote what, in my humble opinion, amounts a  urlLink good review  of how we proceed with rebuilding that war-ravaged country (or fail at it, as many would likely say). We hear of large budgets allocated for the purpose, but we should not fall into complacency thinking that the sort of money available will get the job done one way or the other. That money is bound to eventually go somewhere,- but its destination may be very different from what you may think.

      If you don't know, it is OK. You likely got lots and lots of company. Even though Krar was arrested during what appeared to be preparation for major terrorist activity, his arrest attracted minimal attention from the media and caused no press release by the Department of Justice, which under John Ashcroft, as of the press time for this  urlLink UPI report , had "found at least 2,295 occasions to toot its own horn that are apparently more newsworthy than the Krar arrest".  According to this report,  Krar, who is affiliated with several anti-government, white supremacist militia organizations, was apprehended after mailing a package containing false U.N. credentials, Defense Intelligence Agency IDs, phony birth certificates and a forged federal concealed weapons permit to a co-conspirator in New Jersey.   The package came with a note that read, "We would hate to have this fall into the wrong hands." It did. It was delivered to the incorrect address.  An alert citizen contacted the FBI, which led to the arrest of Krar and the discovery of a mind-numbing weapons cache: fully automatic machine guns, remote-controlled explosive devices disguised as briefcases, 60 pipe bombs, nearly 500,000 rounds of ammunition and enough pure sodium cyanide "to kill everyone inside a 30,000 square foot building," according to federal authorities.  Krar consequently  urlLink pleaded guilty  to possessing a dangerous chemical weapon and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Sounds fair enough to me, and I am satisfied that Mr Krar will be away for awhile and will get a chance to cool his heels and maybe revise his attitude.  What I do find astounding is the near silence surrounding this case,- which is most likely why you are first reading about this gentleman here, if that is the case. One would think that, quoting the same  urlLink UPI report , both the administration and the media would pay more attention to a man whose "arrest by federal law enforcement in the small town of Noonday, Texas, last April may have stopped the most devastating terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11".  So, what is the reason for that near silence? I don't know, but I think part of it may be that the story would not sell, that it lacks the sensationalist value, that maybe after 9/11 the non-Muslim Americans were supposed to be "good guys only" and writing about this sort of individual would be disturbing news that would in turn drive down ratings. Once again, these are just some thoughts of mine, I do not have any serious research to back it up with.  However, be that as it may, the following seem to be some of the lessons from this story. Firstly, not all terrorists are Arab or Muslim. Secondly, not all Arab or Muslim people are terrorists. Thirdly, the evil of all kinds can be found anywhere, and when it is found among us, the worst thing for us to do would be to pretend it is not there,- which is pretty much what the media is covertly trying to get us to do through their biased and incomplete (and, in most cases, outright missing) coverage of the Krar case.

      While I can't fully agree with what Nat Hentoff says in this  urlLink Washington Times article of his  I think he offers some very valid and much needed critique of the recent Michael Moore's blockbuster. He mentions some of the same omissions in the film which I found unconsciable:  Michael Moore — whose movie somehow omits mention of the mass graves, rape and torture chambers — doesn't seem to think Saddam should have been forcibly removed, or that most Americans would care about stopping his atrocious horrors. Mr. Moore has said of his fellow Americans: "They are possibly the dumbest people on the planet ... We don't know anything that's happening outside our country." While Moore unquestionably raises many important issues in his movie, this omission certainly makes any claim to the film's objectivity invalid. I do believe that the administration's deception and starting the war using fabricated data was also inexcusable,- just as much as Moore's omissions and distortions.  Hentoff asks a critically important question:  Would many Americans — if fully informed by George W. Bush — have supported, entirely on humanitarian grounds, sending troops to remove Saddam, remembering how the United Nations and Mr. Clinton could have stopped the slaughter in Rwanda, but failed to act? Alas, due to our administration's political machinations, we do not know the answer to this question. But it is clear that questions like that need to be asked,- and that the truth must be known by all of whom those questions are asked. Deception helps no one, it only exacerbates the crisis, regardless whether the source of that deception is the White House or Michael Moore.

      Human trafficking is a problem that affects most of the countries today. It supports sex slavery, sweatshop slavery, official corruption, gang violence and terrorism. It is  urlLink a major problem in Israel , but it is likely more of a problem in many other places, such as  urlLink Finland .  I believe this problem it is not being properly addressed by the developed country. I also think that there is no way to be serious about fighting terrorism without being serious about fighting that menace. After all, wherever channels are in place to traffic slaves or prostitutes, those same channels can be used to  urlLink traffic terror operatives .  In the US, following the 9/11 attacks various controversial measures, such as the much talked about USA Patriot Act were adopted. The act curtails many civil liberties, and such limitations are often of questionable value when it comes to combating terror groups. However, the US borders remain largely unprotected, and human trafficking groups operate  urlLink a large-scale enterprise  along the Mexican border. And hence the question begs asking, why is the administration pushing through laws limiting its citizens' rights while at the same time not protecting the borders properly,- which is not only its right, but also one of its few original constitutional responsibilities from the very beginning, for if protection of borders is not part of "common defense", I wouldn't know what is.

      Somebody had to say it loud and clear, and I am happy to know that the New York Democrats  urlLink finally did . I can't see how the fact that the choice of both the time and the place to hold the Republican National Convention was highly political can be denied. The main objective, in words of one of them,-  "The Republicans chose to hold their convention here, I think most of us believe, to continue the political exploitation of 9/11, which this administration started almost immediately after 9/11," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, whose congressional district in Manhattan includes the site where the World Trade Center once stood. The Republicans are not unique in that regard. I think it is certainly true that the Democratic National Convention took place in Boston was of course a matter of politics too. However, there are several major differences. Democrats are much more popular in Boston than Republicans are in New York City, especially the Bush-style Republicans. And that is putting it mildly. Many other things can be said about why New York City is not the best choice of venue for the RNC, but suffice it to say,- it ain't very nice to have your little get-together in a house were you are generally not welcome.

       "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," George Bush told an audience of military brass and Pentagon chiefs. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." I heard the last part of this quote elsewhere. This text comes from  urlLink this blog post . Don't know where Bush said it, if at all, but sounds in line with other weird things he is known to have said. Also check out the picture in the  urlLink post ,- humorous, but too close to reality to be truly funny.

      Voter disenfranchisement is nothing new. If it weren't for it we would likely have a different man for President now. However, according to Katrina vanden Heuvel, we as a society are far from having the issue addressed, or even making an honest attempt to do so.  In her  urlLink article on the subject , vanden Heuvel describes many attempts by various parties to make it so that those from whom they have little reason to expect any favors do not get to cast their vote.  ...in St. Louis, Missouri, election officials told voter registration workers that of 30,000 applications submitted, two-thirds had been rejected. No reasons were given... While we are on the subject, I would like to say that personally I think in this day and age the very idea of voter registration sounds archaic. Given the technology available, any citizen must be allowed to vote anywhere. Once the data is entered for the citizen, a verification process should be run to ensure the validity of the data. Once that process completes, he or she must be presented with the proper voting form conforming with the local election requirements. All of that can be done electronically, with the proper electronic replication as well as a paper printout. Sounds incredible? Not so, if you compare it with the systems we use everyday, for instance, the ones that allow us to receive instant credit at a bank or to make purchases with a credit card. However, for now we do have the voter registration procedure in place, so lets get back to the issues as they are.  I believe the first major step towards insuring the fairness in the vote count would be creation of a public election oversight commission empowered to oversee everything related to elections,- from the registration procedures to the software code for the systems involved in the election process. The local and federal election oversight bodies are part of their respective governments, and that makes them suspect. Personally, I think all the technology involved must be open source, wherever possible, to avoid tampering by commercial interests.  Those are just a few thoughts that come to mind. Clearly, someone with more election management experience than yours truly can come up with many more good ideas. They need to be discussed and implemented as when found applicable. For, as vanden Heuvel correctly states,  At  stake, isn't simply our choice for America's next president, but also our faith in  our nation's democracy.

      "John Doe", a decorated US Marines veteran  urlLink has filed a lawsuit  claiming the illegality of the government's attempt to extend the reservists' stay in the military past their official discharge date. The practice, known as the "stop-loss", amounts to effectively compelling an individual to stay in the military beyond what he or she has voluntarily subscribed to, effectively keeping them in uniform against their will.  There is a name for this practice. It is called "military draft". If you prefer a different term, you can call that "conscription". And I certainly believe that if conscription were to become part of our life, it needs to be properly legislated, not run through the back door the way the Bush administration is attempting to do it.  But for now,- all power to "John Doe"!

      Here is a good  urlLink summary  of the case of Mounir el Motassadeq, a 30-year-old Moroccan charged in Germany with aiding the three Hamburg-based suicide hijackers who are alleged to have been part of the 9/11 team. The case against him could be strong,- if it was not for the US failure to cooperate and provide the necessary evidence due to security considerations. He was once acquitted and is now being retried. This time around the US is being a bit more helpful, but likely not to the extent sufficient to secure a conviction.

      As it has already been stated many times, external factors can be a powerful influence in national elections. One of the powerful recent examples is the election in Spain in March of 2004 whose outcome was influenced by the terrorist attacks in Madrid several days prior. To an extent, it is true that terrorists managed to install a coalition that otherwise had little chance of coming to power.  As Dick Morris, a former Bill Clinton advisor, writes in his  urlLink comment ,  ...the key issue is whether America is at war or at peace. And Osama bin Laden has more to say about that than any other person. If he ratchets up the terror threat to the United States and has us looking over our shoulders and thinking twice before we fly, we will feel at war and will back Bush. But if he lets up and backs off for the election, we will revert back to our peacetime posture and likely elect the Democrat.  Personally, I am unsure why Democrats in general and John Kerry in particular ought to be expected to be any less competent to prosecute a war than the current administration. However, Morris likely describes the common sentiment correctly when he states,  If Americans feel they are at war, they will rally to Bush. By a strong majority, they feel he is the best candidate to keep America safe, prosecute the War on Terror, and – even on his worst days – stabilize Iraq. But if they feel the war is over or winding down, they are likely to vote for Kerry. By similar majorities, most surveys indicate voters trust him more to create jobs, help the economy, lower health-care costs, stabilize Medicare and Social Security, reduce prescription drug prices, help improve education and protect the environment. But let us not forget that Osama's anti-Americanism is not known to have grown any weaker over the last several years. Likely, the same can be said of most of his followers. I have no doubt that if they can hit somewhere in the US, they will. And as we know from numerous reports the security at home remains close to what some would call a joke in many ways. Suffice it to say that, to my knowledge, over 90% of the sea-borne containers still enter the country unexpected. Given all that, the fact that since 9/11 Al Quaida has not yet perpetrated another sizeable attack in the US probably is an indication that they are not quite as big a power as some would think. Also, short of another terror attack actually, taking place, as I have said before there is a good reason to be skeptical about the US government's  urlLink terror warnings .  Writes Morris,  ...I think bin Laden will remind us frequently and graphically that we are at war. And I think that may re-elect George W. Bush.  Well, I hope Bin Laden does not get very far in his attempts. But even if he does, I believe that is even more of a reason to vote. And to vote as if Osama was long gone from the scene, for it is difficult to imagine a President who would not fight a menace like Al Quaida, and it is difficult to imagine a President who would wage that fight less competently than George W Bush. And, after all, this is a US election,- and last I heard Bin Laden was not a US citizen, so he should not be allowed to participate in the process.

      I think this is a subject that has yet to be properly addressed. While various sources report,- and credibly at that,- that terror groups and despotic regimes such as that of Saddam Hussein or Yasser Arafat use intimidation of locally accredited reporters and their staff, there does not appear to be a comprehensive study of that phenomena.  In his  urlLink article   Jeff Jacoby gives a good account of how intimidation is facilitated by the Palestinian Authority. I think this is a good case in point. I also think that to an extent the kidnapping and consequent murder of Daniel Pearl was another manifestation of the same phenomena. And while a comprehensive report on the practice is yet to arrive, we must bear in mind that the practice does exist and that even the best journalists working for an independent news media organization are at times unable to report the whole truth from many a place on the globe,- and for a good reason as oftentimes not only are their lives on the line, but also those of their local employees who in effect become hostages of sorts.

      In a world where morals are warped one has a problem at times distinguishing between a foe and a friend, a traitor and a patriot. Army Spc. Joseph Darby was the soldier who first reported the abuse perpetrated at the Abu Ghraib prison by his fellow soldiers. In a way, he broke the code of conduct that exists in every tight-knit group such as a military unit, 'What happens among us stays with us'. It would be understandable if people in his unit were angry at him.  However, it appears that the same sort of perception goes way beyond the confines of the unit. According to  urlLink this ABC News report , the members of the community where Darby and his family live have been shunning and sometimes intimidating the family.  "We did not receive the response I thought we would. People were, they were mean, saying he was a walking dead man, he was walking around with a bull's-eye on his head. It was scary," Bernadette Darby, Joseph Darby's wife, said today on ABC News'  Good Morning America.  Mostly, this is just talk,- even though one can not rule out the presence of a nut case willing to turn to physical violence against the family. However, even barring that possibility, it is a certainty that that family is going through an immensely difficult time. It is not clear from the report where they are from, but it sounds like a small-town community, and in a community like that people count on their social network. Hence alienation of this sort is all the more difficult to endure.  I think we as a society must find ways to show our support for people like Spc. Darby. Contrary to what some of his detractors may think, I believe he is in fact a true patriot, a man with a conscience and a hope for us all. I don't know what the best way to support him is, but support him we must. His family must know that America is not just their town, and that many in it stand behind him and applaud what he had done.

      Well, justice should be blind and judge everybody equally. Thus, what would happen if we apply the standard used  urlLink against Slobodan Milosevic  in all relevant cases?  This is the issue Siddharth Varadarajan is attempting to address in his  urlLink  The Hindu  article . The article quotes from various memos authored by various US government lawyers,- the infamous "torture memos" that have been making rounds through various media. Says Varadarajan,  It is astonishing that despite the existence of such documents — and only censored versions of these memos have been released — there is no clamour within the U.S. to bring charges against Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld for the commission of war crimes by their subordinates.  According to Varadarajan no memos of comparable content have been issued by Mr Milosevic's administration.  Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), had no such documentary evidence when she indicted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in 1999 on four counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war. The crimes concerned the death of 340 Kosovar Albanians at the hands of the Yugoslav security forces. Paragraph 84 of the indictment states that "in as much as he has authority or control over the VJ (Yugoslav army) ... Slobodan Milosevic, as president of the FR of Yugoslavia ... is also criminally responsible for the acts of his subordinates." Para 88 states, "A superior is responsible for the acts of his subordinate(s) if he knew or had reason to know that his subordinate(s) was/were about to commit such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts..."  Another historical parallel that is worth examining is the massacre at Sabra and Shatilla and the  urlLink report  issued by Israel's Kahan Commission tasked with investigating that massacre. The report considers the issue of indirect responsibility thusly:  The argument is that no responsibility should be laid on Israel for deeds perpetrated outside of its borders by members of the Christian community against Palestinians in that same country, or against Muslims located within the area of the camps.  A certain echo of this approach may be found in statements made in the cabinet meeting of 19.9.82, and in statements released to the public by various sources. We cannot accept this position. If it indeed becomes clear that those who decided on the entry of the Phalangists into the camps should have foreseen - from the information at their disposal and from things which were common knowledge - that there was danger of a massacre, and no steps were taken which might have prevented this danger or at least greatly reduced the possibility that deeds of this type might be done, then those who made the decisions and those who implemented them are indirectly responsible for what ultimately occurred, even if they did not intend this to happen and merely disregarded the anticipated danger. This sounds like a proper standard to apply. It was applied, at least to some extent, in Israel, where the scandal that followed Sabra and Shatilla cost Defense Minister Ariel Sharon his ministerial seat.  In 2001 in Kunduz, the Afghan Northern Alliance soldiers transported several thousand Taliban POWs to a remote prison in unventialted trucks. Many died enroute in a horrendous agony, some where later shot to death by the Afghans supervised by the US soldiers. Personally, I don't know how true those allegations are, but the documentary  urlLink 'Convoy of Death'  shot about the subject sounds convincing. It is also worth noting that the said documentary broadcast around the world did not make it into any of the US major networks' programming.  If at Sabra and Shatilla Israeli troops were accused of watching the events from afar and possibly shooting flares to make the Phalangist muderers' job easier, here the allegations state US soldiers' direct and immediate participation in a massacre. And I think the standard of responsibility used in the Kahan commission report is just as applicable in this case.  War crimes have existed for so long as the war itself. However, this is not a reason to be complacent about those crimes. We need to use a uniform standard to define them, and apply this standard to all suspects in a fair and non-prejudicial manner,- regardless of the suspect's rank or position.

       urlLink Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.  is always a delight, in my humble opinion. Few authors have such an incredible ability to infuse their sense of humor into describing or debating various things grave and morbid. His recent  urlLink article  on our times and the essence of being is, in my opinion, a must read.

      In my recent  urlLink rant  on the subject of death penalty, I have mentioned that death penalty cases are not investigated in the US if the sentence has already been carried out. By that time, it is "case closed".  Well, one may say, even if the person was innocent, once they are dead, they are dead. That certainly is about as close to truth as any statement can get,- however, that argument omits one important part of the picture,- by learning whether or not the person who received the sentence was truly the culprit, we stand to gain knowledge as to what went wrong and we can try and prevent occurrences of the same type in the future. Also, if we do indeed discover that a wrong person was convicted and sentenced, then we will also know that a real culprit may still be at large,- and for that reason alone all true law-and-order aficionados should do their utmost to make sure any and every case that merits reinvestigation is investigated,- many times, if necessary. It is bad enough if an innocent person spends years of his life in jail or is executed for something he never did,- the fact that the real criminal is out there somewhere may also be a major threat, as the famous case of the  urlLink 1989 Central Park jogger  rape illustrates. Note that in that case, as is often the case with pathologically violent types, the culprit did not stop at the crime for which others took the heat.  The man, Matias Reyes, is currently serving a 33-year sentence for a string of violent rapes — and one murder — that he committed in the four months after the April 1989 assault on the jogger, which left her near death and in a coma for 12 days.  (Reported   urlLink here   by the ABC News.)   So, we can be relatively confident that one person would be alive and several others would be spared the experience of rape if the authorities did not follow a false trail.  Now, I do not call myself a law-and-order type, but I do like to see violent criminals locked up. So I find it even most surprising that the law-and-order state of Florida headed by a law-and-order Governor Jeb Bush who is a firm supporter of vigorous law enforcement,- including death penalty,- is so reluctant to try and figure out why a man  urlLink spent 22 years in jail  for a rape he had nothing to do with. Personally, I would expect Florida officials to be falling all over themselves if their talk about being committed to law enforcement is anything other than election PR. No matter what they think about the ex-inmate,- an apology to whom would be nice, IMHO,- there likely is a sexual predator out there who needs to be apprehended. And no, this ain't no jaywalking case, this is serious crime, folks!  However, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the State of Florida to act on this.

      In his excellent  urlLink article  Paul McGeough provides a great description and analysis of how the new sovereign government of Iraq carries on with the time-honored custom of torture and brutality,- a custom to which Mr Hussein was an ardent adherent. He also describes what can only be characterized as an outrageous inaction of the American authorities who installed the current Iraqi government.  In all fairness, this is not what Americans are all about. As I have  urlLink noted  earlier, regular Americans in uniform were as outraged by atrocities committed by the new Iraqi regime as any normal human being would be. However, their attempts to put a stop to the atrocities came to naught on the orders of their superiors.  So, are we just back to the good old "good thug, bad thug" game?

       urlLink Karen Kwiatkowski  is a USAF Lt Colonel (Ret.) who spent the last several years working in the Pentagon. Following her retirement, she came out with a blistering expose of how politicized the intelligence process has become within the Defense Department and how the Bush administration effectively manufactured the intelligence to its own order by way of the  urlLink Office of Special Plans .  The following is  urlLink her article  on  urlLink 'Hijacking Catastrophe' , a new documentary released by the  urlLink Media Education Foundation . She mentions facts that I think are critical to understanding the way this administration's thought process:  There are some critical darts thrown in the film, but the few that can be discerned relate to the facts. For example, the general lack of military experience among neo-conservatives is discussed in the context of their most interesting fascination with the use of military force, and their unbelievable disregard for the horrific cost of war both physically and psychologically, on our soldiers, on the purported battlefield enemy, and upon the countries in which they reside.  Based on what she is saying I am likely to expect  urlLink 'Hijacking Catastrophe'  to be more to the point than  urlLink Michael Moore 's  urlLink 'Fahrenheit 9/11' .  Unlike                the Michael Moore treatment in  Fahrenheit 9-11 , where images of the Deputy Secretary of Defense combing his hair with fresh spittle cheapen our horror while turning our stomachs,  Hijacking Catastrophe                 is a working man’s treatment of 21 st  century American foreign policy – what it is, where it comes from, what it wants, what it costs, and how Americans might deal with it. In this regard, the final segments of the film focus on the need to fight fear domestically by engaging in a public debate on the war in Iraq, post 9-11 policies in general, and engendering a real national discussion about what America stands for and how she might more wisely relate to the world, and solve problems instead of creating them. And I think Karen Kwiatkowski's  urlLink archive  is also worth a read.

      At some point, I supported the death penalty. I thought that there were people amongst us who do not deserve to live, people whose very existence is an affront to us, to our morality, to our civilization. Maybe, at the time I was more vengeful, too. I probably was as I wanted murderers dead so that the blood and suffering of their victims may be avenged.  Later, my views changed. I became absolutely opposed to the death penalty as a state-ordered sanction. I still believe there are people who do not deserve to be alive. In fact, I believe there are quite a few of them. However, I do not believe in a methodical, premeditated killing of a person who is already behind bars and has effectively been neutralized as a threat to the society at large.  There are many reasons why my views on the subject are what they are. And what is interesting is that I happen to sometimes find data backing me up in somewhat unlikely places. For instance,  urlLink Steven D. Stewart , the Prosecuting Attorney for Clark County, Indiana, hardly comes across as an abolishionist. In his  urlLink program letter on death penalty , he states his support for the measure and states some facts about it which I would agree constitute benefits,- for instance, the impossibility of repeat crimes by someone who has been executed, as well as the impossibility of escape by the said individual. Other arguments of his are not so strong, in my opinion. For instance, when Mr Stewart states that no one to his knowledge has been executed who was in fact innocent, he is conveniently bypassing the uncomfortable fact that in the US neither have any investigations ever been conducted, nor any court hearings held in order to review the guilt or innocence of anyone who had already been executed. Not so in other countries. In the UK, on the other hand, such investigations are occasionally conducted, and one,- a description of which I am unfortunately unable to obtain at the moment,- had recently found that a man hanged in 1954 for murder was in fact innocent.  But it is not through his "message" that Mr Stewart is supporting my line of reasoning most. Of his whole death penalty web collection the page most helpful to me is his excellent  urlLink compilation  of data on the US executions since the time the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. For the years 2000 to present, the data contains both the sentencing date, and the execution date. Note that the span between the two is quite long,- I think pretty much all of the inmates had to spend at least five years on the Death Row, some ten, some twenty, some,- such as  urlLink James Barney Hubbard ,-close to thirty. So, where is the deterrence? How many people save for those directly affected even remember what the crime was about by the time the culprit walks the last mile? Is ten or twenty years not time enough to commit another murder in prison lest an individual be so inclined? Is that not time enough to plot and execute an escape lest there be a chance?  I believe that there are arguments both in favor and against death penalty. However, I believe that anyone willing to address the issues analytically would have to acknowledge that the system of capital punishment in the US is hopelessly dysfunctional. And as such, it needs to be shut down,- if not forever, then until we as a society decide on what we want it to be and manage to ensure its morality and practicality. Personally, I don't believe a system which would satisfy those requirements can ever be designed.

      In his masterful  urlLink analysis  of the Iraqi key figures that have recently made news reports, Jacob Hornberger shines light on what is quite an open secret,- the US government has been opposing some dictators and terrorists and supporting others,- as long as the latter happened to serve the US interests of the moment. Writes Hornberger,  Ever since the U.S. government abandoned its role as a limited-government republic to become an imperial world interloper, the quest has been to support those dictators in the world who would do the bidding of U.S. officials, no matter how unsavory, corrupt, and brutal those dictators were. That’s in fact why the U.S. government, even while still clinging to its claim that it invaded Iraq to establish “democracy and freedom,” continues to proudly align itself with the brutal military dictator in Pakistan, who took power in a military coup. 'Well, so what?', some may ask. The fundamental problem,- aside from obvious moral issues associated with supporting unsavory characters involved in oppression and mass murder,- is that supporting them is tantamount to running a world-wide monster plantation. We breed monsters,- and then, lo and behold, those monsters for some reasons turn against us or those we view as general friends.  Well, I think this is an issue that needs to become subject of serious discussion. The surprise and indignation we hear every time from politicians and pundits when a friendly dictator becomes a mortal enemy simply should not cut it. Such emotions are to be expected of pre-school children, not of those who analyze and shape policy on the daily basis.
