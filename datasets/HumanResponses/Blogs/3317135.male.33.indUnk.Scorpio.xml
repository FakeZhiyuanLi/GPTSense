      Met someone at the weekend who talked about meta-heuristics for network optimisations - so now am trying to learn about any colonies. Funky stuff - going to write a program next week to play with the traveling salesman problem using ant colony techniques to try and solve it. Still don't know what meta-heuristics really is.. but will start with the ants and build up.  Had a good viola lesson last night - can't wait to master vibrato.. then may be able to make a decent sound out of the thing! Mozart next... :)  Also had a poor game of go - started well and was up, but then white started playing better and i got worse and eventually white thrashed me. However, a 14k observer gave a great review afterwards... white missed last half of the review some next time he better watch out ;-)  18:15 - still at work.. got to go and chill.. trying to get MFC to work with time in millseconds and it ain't having it :-(  That's all for now.. will think of something interesting for tomorrow... byeee!

      Ok.. so I can’t eat spaghetti – actually I can barely spell it. Too much tongue needed so had to chop it up with a knife into lots of bits. Quorn meatballs are yummy tho.  Just about to watch Pirates of the Caribbean – will post tomorrow with comments. Just watched Kelly’s Heros.. excellent film.  Fitted taps on the bath today.. didn’t leak or flood.. there is still hope.  Am now 18k.. eek! I better start learning some more and playing some more.. I’m still rubbish really. MD resigned yesterday.. I got greedy and let one of his chains live (that I should have captured).. but then he didn’t connect it properly and missed one of my moves so I ended up taking it anyway. Felt guilty because I was going to resign earlier. C’est la vie.  Recorded some piano parts to play along with on the viola – is quite cool.. my intonation is soooo bad! Not too much wobble today tho – yeh!  Okdok.. nothing else to say – will try to do something more interesting tomorrow to post about.   Byee.

      Had another good lesson last night but am still getting lots of wobble (unwanted vibration) when making down-bows, especially on the D and A strings. I must practice more and try to be more relaxed when playing. I think I should start trying to average about 1 hour a day, and maybe 2 hours each day on a weekend. Also, I need to split the practice properly between fundamentals and studies, and pieces. Still waiting to get my first vibrato - will be soo neat when I can do that :-)         Go - I think I'm ready to jump up to 18k, and possible 17k within a few weeks. I've sussed some important points about stealing and maintaining eye-space. Am now about half way through the Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go (by Toshiro Kageyama) and have just read about Life and Death. He is a funny writer and has no truck with ideots, so I hope we never meet. Don't know if I'll ever make Shodan, but is something to aspire to.      Haven't done any German practice for a few weeks. I should try and write some Blog entries (or parts of in German). Ok.. here goes - will check spelling after:   Ich versteha ein bischen Deutcsh, aber mein Schreiben ist nicht so güt.   That should be: I understand a little German, but my spelling is not very good. I know the spelling is pants!   urlLink Google  suggests:   Ich verstehe deutsches wenig, aber mein Spelling ist nicht sehr gut.   Spelling is also the same in German.. better check with  urlLink LEO :  Ok.. it has, for spelling,  die Schreibung .   So, this isn't looking too bad. (Just realised that it should be bisschen). (Eek.. it should be gut, not güt - I should have realised from the pronunciation.. what a moron!) Now I think it should be...   Ich verstehe ein bisschen Deutsch, aber mein Schreibung ist nicht so gut.   Hooray.. google concurs.      Work stuff: more testing to do, no coding for days now! Boo... had a call about a permanent job not to far away. senior architect/developer.. sounds cool. The agent phoned like 8 times yesterday trying to contact me.. I eventually phoned him back and he wanted to say that they had my CV - that was it! These people are desperate.     Thas'all for now.. byee.

      A combination of sea-salt mouth washes and lots of ice-cubes has helped the tongue settle down more - I can now eat fish and rice dishes.. yummy! Sea-salt mouth wash is some sort of miracle cure for mouth-related problems.. when my wisdom teeth went mental with infections the salt-wash was better than any of the pain killers or off-the-shelf mouth washes.  Have lost 10lbs.. this week will get below 14st for the first time in years - a skinny nooogle is emerging - cool :-)  Viola is coming along ok, still too much right-arm wobble on the down-bows and the vibrato is still a long way off, but am getting some nice sounds out occasionally.  Drumming also getting better.. playing along to Fever To Tell (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, excellent album) and the Coral Fang (The Distillers – also cool band). Still haven’t mastered any jazz drumming and can’t really start playing along to Rush yet.. it will come.. I hope ;-)  House prices started falling – is this the beginning of something…?  What else.. EU Constitution agreed my ministers.. will anyone vote for it??? Seems unlikely that all countries will ratify it… the clowns in UKIP hope not, but then they are clowns.  Started writing a C# application for Game Of Life.. had cool idea of allowing plug-in rule bases and visualisations – then this morning thought that I should allow for 3-d-ish GoL.. instead of a cell being occupied or not it could have a level of occupation. Cool thought again!-> could then allow fuzzy rule bases to determine output of each iteration.. cool :-)  That’s all for now.. byee ;-)

      So just over a week since the tongue got pierced.. now I can speak pretty well (as well as I ever did) and am eating some solid foods. I can sometimes see the bar which means the swelling is going down and can't wait for a shorter bar, maybe thicker guage, and a funky ball or something cool on the top. Already it seems a litle like the tatoos, in that I can't imaging not having it - funny how you assimilate yourself so quickly with body mods.  T has got a bad dose of flu or something - can't brush her hair cos her head hurts :( so probably no work for her today.  Found some bugs in code at work, so got time to update blog and practice some German. Practice or practise...? Must figure.. is different between uk and usa.. my English is so bad :(  Had a good viola lesson last night - still no vibrato yet - boo - will take a few months. It is probably the hardest instrument I've played - the entire upper body needs to be used correctly, otherwise it sounds like a cat in a fair amount of pain.   Also - have lost about 7-8 lbs since last Tuesday.. coool.. am gonna be skinny in about a month from now.. then all i need to do is figure out how to grow some hair and I'll be happy.  Thas'all for now... keep piercing and coding and musicing, etc.  Byee :)

      Hallo blog.. so on Wed (4 days ago) I got my tongue pierced. Seems like there are two kinds of people in this world.. those who say "yeah, that's cool, can I see?" etc, and those who say "why? didn't it hurt? but you can't eat/speak/spit/swallow" etc. I think I you fall into the latter then don't worry about trying to understand. I know people who have or want to get labrets (lip/cheek) piercings and, while I don't know if I'd get one (mainly because of work considerations) I think it would be cool.   So anyway, to record the excellent adventure of getting a centre tongue piercing (you can also get off centre, horizontal, surface, etc) I will try to keep a record of how its going. First, a flash back to Wednessday...  Wed 9th June - 12:25 Walk into Pierced Up (Bristol,UK) - have calmed my nerves at this stage - they don't take [credit] cards to I walk down the hill to the hospital (!) for a cash machine. Walk back up hill, and its hot, so by the time I get there I'm sweating... I figure this won't look so good so pause for a few minutes to restore composure and go back in. The place is really cool, very modern and not dingy like some other tatoo places. Fill in the compulsory form (over 21, etc) and go with (? forgot name.. oops ?) into the room. Piercing room is very clean which instills confidence. Piercer sits me down and goes through the procedure - also gives me mouthwash. This was all cool because I'd researched the whole thing on www.bmezine.com and all the good stories start like this!   Next step was to examine tongue with a torch to check the veins.. all good. Then he marks my tongue with a purple pen and asks me if its ok, then marks the bottom of the tongue. So far so good. Then, with some sort of absorbant paper, he holds my tongue in place (no clamps) - I'm thinking at this stage he is just probing when, all of a sudden, the needle goes through. It wasn't that I didn't know he was going to do it, he was just very efficient with the time. (He probably did say he was going to do it, but I was a little excited by events at this stage!) Then I felt a little push as the bar went through, but no additional pain; the needle doesn't hurt a bit.. is just an odd sensation - not pleasant, but nothing to get freaked about. He must of fastened the ball on the top, but I didn't feel anything. So, after just a few seconds, it was all done - I looked in a mirror and thought, wowowow!   Did another rinse of mouthwash (Tech 2000 I think) and then stood there while he went through the after-care advice. (Don't smoke, no sort of oral contact with anyone, including french kissing, rinse lots with an alcohol-free wash, etc.). While this was going on I felt a little sick, it was really hot that day and the combination of heat and the whole experience started spinning my head a bit. He asked if I was ok, and I think I said yes, but he obviously figured I was loosing it a bit so sat me down - cool.. that saved the day. Then finished off the after-care, went out and paid, and walked back to the car.   By now I'm on top of the world and sit looking at it in the mirror for a couple of minutes - cool! The drive back is intense.. don't feel queesy at all, but do feel changed; not better than other people, or anything like that, but just privately improved like I'd just done a bungee jump (but the buzz was going to last for a long time!) Get back to work.. hadn't told anyone I was getting it done, but they figure somethings up when I can't speak properly - I have a lisp - woh! So then there's the customary showing of the tongue, and much fascination. Only person who was into it was a girl who has her tongue done.. I'd asked her lots of questions first.. so it was cool to have one person around who thought it was cool. Didn't try to eat at work, just mouth wash every half hour or so, and lots of water.  Got home about 6pm - showed my wife - she thought it was cool (phew!). Then figured I'd have some food. I'd bought ice cream and rice pudding, and the pudding looked yummy. Er... no good, spent half an hour and only managed two teaspoons - haha.. I'd read about how hard eating could be but hadn't really expected to miss normal food so quickly. So then moved onto ice cream - this was a bit better, but moving my mouth was still painful, so I left it. Tongue didn't seem too swollen, so I went to bed and slept like a happy, pierced log :-)  Thursday, 10th June Haha.. there are tooth marks on my tongue - I've never had that before. I really can't speak much and don't fancy idea of eating, but I take my mouthwash and more rice pudding to work. I managed to eat 1/3 tin rice pudding by mixing it with honey - this tastes good but still takes about 30-40 minutes. Then spend the day not talking (everyone says how quiet it is now!) and eating the rest of the tin. Surface of tongue is slightly yellow - no discharge or anything untoward, so am not too worried. Get home and have a couple of slim-fast drinks. Oh, and I've lost about 4lbs...!  Friday, 11th June By early afternoon the surface of my tongue is really yellow.. am getting a bit nervous so ask the girl with her tongue pierced to have a look. She just laughed and said that it is just all the manky stuff collecting because I can't move my tongue to clean it properly.. feel quite relieved. Just slim fasts today.  Saturday, 12th June Not much talking, more slim fasts. Go to a BBQ on the evening... ohohoho the smell of meat is too much.. so spend half an hour slowly munching a tiny piece of gammon... delectable! Meet another person whose first reaction is 'cool', and lots more horrified people.   Sunday, 13th June - today So this morning, after brushing my teeth, I brushed my tongue. The yellow layer has gone... I noticed, as I was brushing, that I was totally drooling and burst into laughter.. you had to be there I suppose. Have ran out of mouth wash now, so have moved onto sea-salt in warm water. It feels better, and I remember that this was the magic wash that saved me when my wisdom teeth went mental on me.  So now, on my fifth day of having a centre tongue piercing, am I still pleased. You bet your sweet ass I am. This is the best thing I've done this year. As long as I keep up the oral hygiene and don't eat too many solids for a while it will all be cool. Probably got another 10 days at least before I go back to get a smaller bar put in, and maybe a funky ball or something on the top.. will have to wait and see.  So, if you're thinking of doing it, and don't mind not speaking and eating much for a couple of weeks, then it is totally worth doing. Am now pondering what comes next.. this stuff is addictive!  Bye for now :)
