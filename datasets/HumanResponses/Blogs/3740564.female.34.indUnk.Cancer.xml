      ...about a lot of stuff.    Got a mustard-slathered chicken roasting.  It smells good.    This is just kind of a test post. I don't have anything to say.

      I prefer the look that Blogger and Typepad give to blogs.    And I'm in the mood to play with other blog tools.    And why the hell not?    For the time being,  urlLink AliGator  on AOL Blogs will remain my main blog, but I may make the switch for good.  If I do, I'll let you know.

       urlLink Nook  posted  urlLink this link  in his blog.  So I took the test, too.  Here are my results:  Wackiness: 36/100 Rationality: 42/100 Constructiveness: 78/100 Leadership: 56/100  You are an SECL--Sober Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a politician. You cut deals, you change minds, you make things happen. You would prefer to be liked than respected, but generally people react to you with both. You are very sensitive to criticism, since your entire business is making people happy.  At times your commitment to the happiness of other people can cut into the happiness of you and your loved ones. This is very demanding on those close to you, who may feel neglected. Slowly, you will learn to set your own agenda--including time to yourself.   You are gregarious, friendly, charming and charismatic. You like animals, sports, and beautiful cars. You wear understated gold jewelry and have secret bad habits, like chewing your fingers and fidgeting.  You are very difficult to dislike.     Uh, yeah.  It's all true except for the part about sports and gold jewelry.  Oh, and the POLITICIAN part.  What's up with THAT?  Have I missed my calling?  (Did I ever find it?)  In four years will we be seeing the slogan "AliGator -- Your choice in Oh-Eighter"?     Probably not.  But at least by then I'll be  urlLink old enough  to be President of The United States of America.                                      *** I got some cool gifts for my birthday.  First were some lovely e-cards and e-mails from friends far and wide.  Then came an Amazon gift certificate.  Then I got a gift certificate for a MASSAGE.  A little money, with which I bought the Lost In Translation and Virgin Suicides DVDs, which came out today in a little package deal.  And finally, I didn't have to cook dinner last night.  We had people in, and I got to sit while other people prepared the meal.                                       ***  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  came out today in France.  It is playing NOWHERE in La Rochelle.  I can't believe it.  The closest city it's playing in is Saintes, and we all know that that's 75 km away.  I'm hoping that it'll be playing somewhere here next week.  Two of our cinemas are closed after hosting an  urlLink international film festival .  They're the kind of cinemas most susceptible to show films like Moore's, anyway.   Thinking:  This looks much better than  urlLink my entry at AOL .

      It's one of those "Curl up in bed and read a book" kind of days.  The kind where you read, and stretch, and sleep.  Then you wake up, stretch, smile, and maybe read some more.  You fix a hot beverage for yourself and get back into bed with it. Repeat as needed.  And you do all of it naked.
