      I'm tired. Really tired. Not that I'm not always tired, but you know sometimes things just get to be too much. Like math class, or work, or school all together. I live for the weekends. And this weekend was pretty awesome too. Friday night Kyle got off the bus at my house and my mom later drove us to Erin's (actually, I drove for a bit, because I have my g1 and my mom screamed because I took a corner too fast, but that's another story) In case you're wondering (which you should be), Erin and Kyle: yeah, they're my best friends. I'll tell you more about them later. So anyways, Friday was great because we basically hung out and watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch (don't ask, we have some sort of obsession with transvestites) and Kyle's dad picked the two of us up at about 11:00, which is rather early for him usually. But I'm sort of glad he picked us up so early because on the way to my house to drop me off, the car broke down. I mean, it just completely died. I remember thinking that I should have worn shoes rather than sandals and maybe a sweater would have been nice. But Kyle's dad let me sit in the car while the two guys went to see what the matter was under the hood. Needless to say, they couldn't find out and we ended up abandoning the car on the side of the road and walking for what seemed like forever until we hit a gas station that was closed, but conveniantly had a pay phone. It was kind of cool because it reminded Kyle and I of our favourite movie, Rocky Horror Picture Show. I mean, the car breaks down, they have to walk for a long time for help, and they use a phone. It all fits. So we took that oppurtunity to sing, "Over at the Frankenstein Place". Kyle's dad desperately tried to phone his mom or a cab or something and we finally got one that would agree to come pick us up from boonie-ville. We ended up waiting for 2 hours though in the freezing cold and Kyle and I had to take shelter in the phone booth. I got in at quarter to 2 and basically passed out the minute my head hit the pillow.  On Saturday Kyle and I went to Tabatha's birthday party. Erin couldn't come, which sucked because she really would have enjoyed it and she could have saved me from Emanuel's constant molesting.   Today was a good day. I woke up thinking that I just wanted to sleep all day long, but Kyle soon phoned me ruining that dream (aha..literally) and we decided to go see a film. We went to see Van Helsing, a movie which wasn't very good, but I had a great time anyways. I think Kyle was scared. He grabbed my hand really hard the first time a creature came out from the darkness. We went to Pizza Pizza for food afterwards and then he left because his dad came to drive him home... Some guy thought I was a prostitute while I was waiting for my ride to arrive, and he threw 20 dollars at me, which I joyfully grabbed and ran away with.   End of weekend analysis: I'm tired. I'm dreading school tomorrow (because I skipped on Friday and am going to get caught for that now), but I'm 20 dollars richer.

      I'm so extremely tired. And you may be sitting there wondering why I am so *extremely* tired. So, what I will do is, I will tell you. I'm at the cottage right now. Doesn't sound very tiring,huh? Well it is. I just I should start with Thursday. Kyle's dad came and picked me up to spend the day hanging out with none other than.. Kyle! Haha. So I went and didn't end up going home until eleven. We walked to Tim's, we played baseball with Brett (Kyle says I have a pretty good throw for a girl. I told him he does too) and we just hung out. But yeah, I slept for awhile Friday. I was tired. And I knew I was supposed to go to Kyle's sister's dance recital (which is a really huge event-his whole family was there- everyone from grandma to second cousins haha) so Kyle called for me at about 3 and I asked him what I should wear. He told me that it was semi formal so not to dress up too much, but it's not casual. So I wore a black and white skirt and a black blouse and put my hair up. I got to Kyle's house and his sister (who answered the door in all her dance makeup) told me he was downstairs and we hung out a bit before the show, before finally going upstairs where Kyle's mom then ooed and awwed about how cute we both were and how gorgeous I looked and then his sister made the brilliant observation that Kyle and I matched (he was wearing a black shirt with a white tie). All night all his sister's friends and his grandparents and aunts kept pointing out how we matched, it was so embarassing. We went out for dinner, the lot of us after the recital. Kyle and I sat across from each other in a booth with two of his sister's friends. Then Friend A asks Alicia (his sister) if Kyle and I were dating and Alicia yelled across three tables, "KYLE IS SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?!" and we just looked at each other, smiled and grabbed hands across the table. He looked lovinly into my eyes, then back at Alicia and said, "She's my fiance". Later on in the evening, Kyle's dad drove us home. It was about 12:30 and we had awhile to wait in the car. Kyle grabbed my hand and we held hands the whole way although we both fell asleep several times.   I got in at 1. I had to wake up at 6 because I had to take the 3 hour trip up to the cottage for work. I worked all day, completely exhausted. My day finally ended and my boss asked me to come in again the next day. That night, Bennet and CJ came over at 11 and demanded we start a fire in the pit. So I figured that'd be okay. But after an hour of campfiring we decided to play hide and seek and were playing until 2:30. I didn't have to work until 11 the next day,but still. I'm tired.  I am now going to sleep.

      I had a talk with Kyle. We talked for a long time and I realized that I wouldn't ever want to be any more than just friends with him. It'd be weird having a romantic relationship with him. And he doesn't want that either. We're best friends, why ruin anything? But I still don't think him and Erin going out would be a great idea. For one, I'd be pretty ticked off because then I couldn't be the same with Kyle that I am now. I wouldn't be able to kiss him or hug him or just be close with him anymore. And maybe that's selfish, but I don't care. He was my friend in the first place. And I realize that they probably will go out, but I'll see what happens when and if that comes. I love Kyle and I never ever want to lose him and he will always be my best friend.  I still haven't spoken to Erin, I don't really know how long it's been, but I really don't care.   I'm happier than I've been in a long time. I'm happier than I ever thought I could be and I love it. Because you see, for the first time in about 5 months, I don't feel ditched or jealous or out of place. I just feel that what I have with Kyle is right. And I wouldn't change it for a thing. I finally think I have my life exactly how I want it right now.

      Okay, so I went to my sister's graduation today (God, did she ever look gorgeous.She honestly shone). And my dad dropped me off at home afterwards, like I said. And so no one is home, so I figure it wouldn't be a problem to strip out of the frickin hot dress I had been wearing in my living room. But just as I get it off, I realize the door's open and my cat is leaping outside, happily. Now, the thing is... My cat is an indoor cat. She's not supposed to be outside. And so, not thinking, I run outside after my cat in my under garments. My cat leads me across the side of my house, and into my neighbour's yard. I honestly wasn't even thinking, but I grabbed my cat, and turned to go inside when I noticed my neighbour's WHOLE family sitting on the back porch. Since when are they home that early, I think. But it turns out it's 6:30 and they were all set on having a nice barbecue in their scenic backyard. So I waved, smiled, then went back inside.  Oh man. I'm an interesting one.

      What a brilliant song. By none other than *drumrolls* Meatloaf! Not a Meatloaf fan? That's okay, I'll forgive you. But I'm seriously very excited because I heard from a very reliable source (ok, I saw it in HMV) that there's a Meatloaf DVD full of concert footage, songs, and much much more! Eeeee! I sound like a really bad shopping channel spokesperson. I've decided that that is my future ambition... Shopping channel spokesperson. I'm sure that for someone who's failing math, that is the proper career choice. Yes. And I've done it again.

      What a fab day. Not that anything too too great happened, but it was just one of those days that really makes you feel good. Probably because I haven't spoken to Kyle for a few days and he came on MSN today and it overjoyed me to find that he hadn't been avoiding me, he was just grounded. But anyways. It was my sister's graduation today and my dad picked me up to go and he let me drive and everything. My God, did she ever look gorgeous. Honestly. She shone. But enough about that (and if she finds out I said that, I'll kill you all). On the way home, my dad was driving and Meatloaf's Bat out of Hell came on the radio so needless to say, we both burst into a huge musical number for the rest of the way home (it's a long song, give me a break). Times like these make me realize how I can't possibly hate my father despite what he's done. Wow, this is mushy. I'm leaving.

      It   just   occured to me.. Just now. I was sitting here, looking at my costume, longing for another chance to get all dressed up and go out to the Rocky Horror Picture Show when it dawned on me. It's Friday! Now I nearly fell off my chair with excitement (Wow, I fall off my chair too much) and antici.....pation for this great event. Yes. I have something to live for again.

      Last night Ran called and said, "I know you've already seen it, but I'm taking my brother to Harry Potter and I figured you could use a sort of girl's night out". So I went. It was fun, but like, every other seat in the old frickin theatre we went to was broken, so we had to sit seperate from each other. Tabatha was like, "You guys were supposed to see that with me!" so I think I'm in for it again.... Oh well.

      You know you can follow my voice.  God, I love my friends... Sooo much. Seriously, they are really making this so much easier for me. Well, maybe not easier, but they're really giving me someone to vent to.  Especially Ran and Cordell. Because Ran went through the same thing because Cordell was torn between her and this girl, Ema. He chose Ran! Woot! Ok, anyways... Cordell is Kyle's best friend and so I suppose he's trying to talk to Kyle for me. He's great because he tells me everything. And Ran calls me every day to see how I'm doing and stuff.  They're seriously amazing.  And that's not even with Courtney's support. She constantly tells me that any guy who makes me cry is not worth the tears. She's honestly so great. I don't know what I'd do without those three.  Tabatha really cheers me up too. Just yesterday she said, "I'm soo sorry I didn't raise my son better." (Tab calls Kyle her son because of the fact that she's always telling him to do stuff a mother would do so he started calling her mom)   Yesterday I was talking to Cordell and I was like, "Seriously, tell me. Does Kyle even like me?" and Cordell went, "YEA!?"  I guess it must be a really hard thing for Kyle too, though. Like, he has to deal with the fact that two girls are completely in love with him. One of them being his best friend (me), and the other one being my "best friend". It is quite the situation. So he's not completely to blame. I just kind of wish they'd never met. Then I wouldn't have ever felt ditched or alone and now heartbroken. I guess that's selfish, but I don't care. He's my friend.  But anyways, I was supposed to be talking about how great my friends are... So here I go.  They are amazing and I love them so much. What would I do without my 24/7 Support Line? (ie:Cordell and Ran who have both told me they're here for me no matter what or when)  I think I'm finished for now.

      I woke up this morning to the sun on my face from my window. It was nice and I felt very warm inside. You know when you first wake up and don't realize where you are or what day it is or even what you have to do that day? It was like that because for about 3 seconds after I opened my eyes, I was completely happy. I wasn't worrying about Kyle or what I'll have to say to him today. In fact, I even *felt* better. That is, until the harsh reality of my life came hauntingly back, slapping me in the face and I realized that I *do* have to talk to Kyle today, and that, today very well may be the day that I get my heart completely shattered. But I'll always have those 3 seconds this morning where I was completely at ease, carefree. And maybe, just maybe I'll be able to go on for another day.

      Okay, so it's quite evident that I have not yet gone to sleep. Why, you may be wondering? Why it is simply because I have so much to ponder. And I keep listening to Wicked Little Town. What a stupendous song. It's quite the pondering song, if you ask me. Not that it's *really* helping, but hey... It's not doing damage, right? Anyways, I'll stop babbeling now. I was going to write about my damn crappy situation some more, but I don't believe I will.

      Forgive me for I did not know 'Cuz I was just a boy-you were so much more. Many God could ever plan More than a woman or a man. Now I understand How much I took from you. And when everything starts breaking down You take the pieces off the ground. Show this Wicked Town something beautiful and new. You think that luck has left you there  But maybe there's nothing up in the sky. And there's no mystical design No cosmic lover preassigned. There's nothing you can find That can not be found. 'Cuz with all the changes you've been through It seems the strangers always you. Alone again in some new Wicked Little Town. And when you've got no other choice You know you can follow my voice Through the dark turns and noise of this Wicked Litte Town.  It's a Wicked... Little Town. Goodbye Wicked.... Little Town.

      I don't know who's brilliant idea it was to go to Toronto, but we went. It was quite more complicated than the usual drive-into-Toronto trip. The Gang and I had to all get driven to the Brampton Go Station to in Toronto and find our way around Toronto all by ourselves. It was amazing. I'm actually surprised my mom trusted me to do that by myself. I mean, I'm an idiot and could have easily messed everything up. But I guess she knew that I was at least with Courtney who is, in fact: always the responsible one.  But anyways, we got to Toronto really early (okay, 8:30... not particularily early, but early for us) and no shops or anything were open yet, so the Gang (Courtney, Ran, Cordell, Kyle, and I) went to Toronto Harbor and hung out there for awhile. It was kind of nice if you didn't think about all the pollution infesting Lake Ontario. Kyle held my hand. My God, WHY is he doing this to me? Like... He knows I love him. And he knows that he's just going to have to break my heart because he STILL hasn't said anything.... So why is he doing this? I want to talk to him. I want to say something. But I just can't. I've done a lot of talking, he knows EXACTLY how I feel. And I know nothing of how he feels. Like absolutely nothing. I can't sleep. It physically hurts me. Oh God. I'm getting sidetracked....  We went shopping and made Courtney pose in front of Hooters. Which she did gleefully, of course. We went to a bunch of gothic stores that Ran ended up running out of. Then we went to Kensington Market and found a nice little playground where Cordell and Ran swung on the swings and Kyle and I seesawed and Courtney eyed us all like the protective motherly-type she is. It was fun. Kyle held my hand some more... And by some more, I mean basically all day. WHY?! This is killing me.  Okay, okay... Moving on.... Umm... We had lunch and hung out in the park and stuff which was kind of nice and relaxing despite the fact that I can not feel "nice" emotions right now and the last thing on my mind is relaxation... But it was good. I still haven't talked to Erin, but everyone says I shouldn't, and I'm not really worrying about it too much.  It's nearly 12 and I can't sleep. Ran called Kyle and he's in trouble,so can't use the phone and she was going to get him to call me. I don't want to talk. I'm really glad he's in trouble (not really, because I know it annoys him when he gets in trouble for stupid things). I just really didn't want to talk. I don't know what to say.   Anyways, I've bored everyone *looks around to see no one and cries* and myself, so I'm going to try to get some shut-eye.

      I'm going to die. Have a nice day.  Like, this is going to sound really ridiculous, but.... My heart actually hurts. Like, I feel pain in my chest and it's heavy and not very nice. Is this heartbreak? Or heartache? Oh god, kill me.

      Oh man. This post is honestly the most pointless thing I've ever seen in my life. Ok, I really really can't wait until I have that picture adder thing on here so I can add a picture of my Power Ranger, Billy. One time my sister and I were overly tired.... (It was 2 in the morning) and we made a video on webcam with my Power Ranger and Cat in the Hat doll. And we had the Power Rangers Theme song playing in the background. It was so lame. And then next day I had friends over and I showed them and I honestly had no idea how BAD that movie was, so needless to say I spent the whole time watching the video falling off the chair and crying from laughter. They laughed. And gave me funny looks. Whatever.  BYE!

      Right now, at this very moment I am talking to Piers. Now this may not seem like such a big deal, but he just made a pancake about the size of 3 dinner plates AND didn't even save me any. He also airbrushed his pickguard on his guitar black... I told him to paint a portrait of me on there too, but I highly doubt that'll happen. Now the reason why I love Piers so much is not because he's a Pixie or a Leprechaun or that he's really mellow (although all those things are good too). It is simply because he's such a great listener. He's not much of an advice-giver, but when you really need someone to talk to, he's there. For example, I've been telling him about my "issue" with Erin and Kyle and whatnot and he listened to the whole of it (which took me about 30 minutes to explain) and finally said, "So kill them." Just like that. Like, good idea Piers, I'll have a masacre. That'll go over very nicely. But he's great. The end.

      Yesterday was   such   a great day! It was, officially my first day of summer and I woke up a little disappointed to be quite honest because I realized that since my mom is still teaching for another week I don't have a ride anywhere. So I pulled out the ol' Disney movies and started watching some of my favourites: Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan. Then I realized how pathetic it was that I was spending my first day of summer watching Disney movies.... So I finished watching Beauty and the Beast and then I went to go make some plans. Courtney and I finally decided to go Corset-shopping for our next Rocky Horror. She bought a really simple, but sexy black corset while I tried on several skimpy night gowns and corsets before realizing that my corset will do me just fine. Then we went to Claire's (the perfect little girl store) and discussed which boas would look best with each person's corset and we ended up getting a black boa that I'm fairly sure we're going to make Kyle wear. And I say "make" like we really have to force him to do any of this stuff. But yeah. I phoned Kyle from my cell phone and told him we were going to catch the 8:30 show of Harry Potter. He met us there at 7:30 and we hung out for awhile before finally going into the theatre to watch the movie. It was great. I bought a shirt that says fa shizzle. I'm sorry to anyone who reads this who is black or thinks they're black. But when I saw that shirt I suddenly felt very ghetto.

      No one really understands how much this whole situation is killing me. The situation? Oh right. The one that involves some sort of bizarre love triangle between my best friend, Kyle, Erin and myself. I honestly don't know where to begin, but I'm really not going to go through the whole thing. But I'll sum it up: Erin met Kyle through my friends and I. Erin fell in love with Kyle. Erin didn't know that I had been in love with Kyle all along. Erin kissed Kyle. Twice. Erin found out about how I felt. Erin doesn't care. And she hasn't backed off.   Now when I told her how I felt things seemed to be okay. But then she started saying things like, "Well maybe you'll get over him and it'll be okay." and stupid stuff like that that made me think that she really didn't care how I was feeling at all, she was just interested in her own wants. And we talked about the whole issue in great detail. She agreed that she wouldn't pursue anything with Kyle so long as I liked him. But really, she's still after him, but in a more subtle way. How I see it is if she were only interested in a friendship, then she'd be inviting some of *my* other friends over to her house along with him behind my back. But honestly, she's just trying to get close with him, but in a friendly, "innocent" manner. So basically, she hasn't backed off at all.It seems like she's constantly trying to screw me over.   And I talked to Kyle about all this. He says that I'm his best friend (which I knew) and that he'll do absolutely anything to make things okay between us (me and him, not me and Erin). And I believe him, because I know he cares. But his friend, Cordell was talking to me and told me that Kyle had feelings for me too. He just didn't want anyone to get hurt. But I guess he doesn't realize that that is already happening.   God, I don't know what to do.
