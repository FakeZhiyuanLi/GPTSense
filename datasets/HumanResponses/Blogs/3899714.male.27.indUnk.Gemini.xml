      Although this day&nbsp;began with the&nbsp;gentile waving of&nbsp;curtains in a summer breeze,&nbsp;as if they were&nbsp;trying to tease me by keeping me from the view on&nbsp;a sunny and&nbsp;carefree world,&nbsp;&nbsp;right now, my humeur&nbsp;is totally - excusez moi le mot - fucked up.  To blame:  10.00 AM&nbsp;Newspaper:  Last week, at least three babies died from maltreatment from their parent(s). Hey, you're 19 years old, you have this cute little fella to take care of and there is a party going on, so what do you do? Yes, indeed, you dump this minor problem for three days with an ex-boyfriend who is too stupid enough to realize that a&nbsp;person&nbsp;needs input (food&nbsp;e.g.) and that a three-year old does not respond accordingly&nbsp;to some kung fu based arguments to shut up crying for food, and go to that party. Or stab it to death. Or create a fine case of dead-shaken-baby-syndrome. It's&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful day, hey hey.  &nbsp;  11.15 AM Mail  An automatic mail from the 'flemish liberals and democrats' party: Sunday is congress day! Approval is needed for the&nbsp;line of policy of the new flemish government (= coalition of christian democrats, socialists and liberals, everybody but the - fast growing - fascist movement Vlaams Blok, like this is going to work decently).&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour before, I read in the newspapers that further negotiations are postponed until Monday.&nbsp;Contradiction + Sunday, I'm not in Brussels. Damn, but... it is still a beautiful day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  11.45 AM Telephone Call  'Le syndic' has some more news:&nbsp;we have to break up my little courtyard, a neighbour is complaining about&nbsp;water damage -&nbsp;repayment&nbsp;by the insurance company not guaranteed - AND&nbsp;I have to pay 50% extra charges for the fire insurance. Normally, I don't care to&nbsp;much for money, but&nbsp;this bites.  &nbsp;  02.30 PM&nbsp;Dishes  Today, for the second time, I do the dishes. As countless generations have done before me. And I hate it. Stupid newspaper. Stupid sunny world.  &nbsp;  djr    &nbsp;  Soon, The Fifth Day: how I got over it by winning a million&nbsp;EUR on the state lottery !

      This is how I made this third day useful:   Got out of bed at 8.30u. LATE !!!!!!!!!!  Spent half an hour trying to call a "GAS CONTROL ORGANISM". Doubt began sneaking up at me, but I was lucky: I even managed it to make an appointment (thu 15/04/04 13.00h) with something that sounded like a woman. No surprise here.  Took some copies of very important papers. Had to go back to the copycentre - needed copies of slightly other very important papers. EUR0.80 down the drain.  Went back to the apartment which I try to renovate (= make it more suitable for mammals other then pigs). I felt like a little chat with the workers, but in situ: no plummers, no cable guys, no plasterers. No progression. But I did NOT get nervous: I calmly cancelled the appointment I had with that female gas control organism and did some stuff myself. Nothing very impressive, I have to admit.  Later on, I went to the academy of music in that part of Brussels. Main aim: enlist myself for some music classes next year. Primo: Piano lessons level 7. Secundo: Music history level 2. Tertio: pick up those cello lessons for beginners / try to get accepted in the local (catholic) choir / limit myself wisely to two courses. Alas, school closed, no entrance, no opening date, no reply on the telephone number. The fax, on the contrary, was being very helpful. Didn't understand my needs, though. I went back home.   But this day had his sunny side: I did learn something new about this world: there is a Lichtensteinian composer and his name is Charpentier! He is no close relative of the great (French; that's why he's so great) composer and he's already dead, but imagine, Lichtensteinian! And if we look in his palette: Vaduz symphonies I&II, "An der schönen blauen Malbuner Bach" and the famous aria "Soll ich einmaal die Plassteikopfspitze anschauen". Surreal.  greetings,   djr  PS: To ananasdinges: congratulations. But a reward in terms of a something tactile, something materialized: none, sorry.

      In attempt to being really tricky and confusing djr decided to completely screw me over with clues as to finding his website, yes CLUES  1 starting with: de jonge  2 I incarnate a dead Dutch painter (didn't ask for his permission, though) 3 keyword: movie = rabbi jacob  a riddle even. lol put dutch painter rabbi jacob in Google and found lots of gruesome stories about rabbis being killed by painters and dutch painters calling jacob rabbi.  Or if you want to know where the name  urlLink Jacob  comes from lol... yes sera went aaall out. Now i'm supposed to write something really witty about myself so you'll wanna read everything i post on this website. Or i could do some gratuous self publicity...naah i'll let you guys figure out my name in english and be evil. And in secret i'm actually also related to djr. But one of us must be adopted. Somehow :P *Runs away as life drives her to the "Lemon-Tree-song-put-on-repeat" side of sanity*

      Ahum... it goes like this:  Who's goin' to help me with my tax return, tax return, tax return. Who's goin' to help me with my tax return, 'cause I don't know.  Where should I mention my pension fund, pension fund, pension fund. Where should I mention my pension fund, 'cause I don't know.  And what the hell are moveable advance tax payments, tax payments, tax payments. And what the hell are moveable advance tax payments, 'cause I don't know. (tricky)  So tell me what I should do with my tax return, tax return, tax return. So tell me what I should do with my tax return, 'cause I don't know !  (Ask my younger brother for the tune - remind him of the singing bird with a string coming out of his cloaca and the mysteriously up-and-down moving eyes. It made him ganz verrückt.)  djr

      I lay my hand on a cheapandfast internet connection, I guess that... will be all right. Enchanting the natives of internetland yes, but not at all costs. Anyway, a new dawn is breaking on the barren shores of this wild and unknown island of bits'n'bites...  But it's almost twelve o'clock, and tomorrow is a busy day, so bis Morgen !  djr
