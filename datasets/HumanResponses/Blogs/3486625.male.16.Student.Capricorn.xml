      Yeah, sure, we all get that same feeling. Someone pisses you off dearly and all you want to do is (insert own version of hate crime). Then again, what the hell is the point? Look at the bigger picture. A few days of self-content vs. a lifetime of wasting your effort on someone thats not even worth it. Don't feel pissed off, feel sorry. Feel sorry that they have to live not knowing that a dozen people are right up their throats.  And if you aren't a person who wants someone to pay and your friend is, then just laugh off at the ppl plotting against each other while you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the show, whatever the outcome is. Am I right or am I right?

      Why post blogs?? Because your friends force you to that's why! Hence the start of this blog, due to peer pressure and necessity. Don't feel bad if you are forced to do something, feel happy they can be stuffed forcing you! YEAH!

      Exactly what the title says. Cannot be stuffed. Nope cbs. Too lazy, ain't gonna get off my a** to do it, it can wait until next week, or next month or someother time in life. There are priorities that must be attended to! Everything else = CBS

      The following guidelines should be observed when completing a task set by a supervisor, specifically for VET IT 3&4.  1. Don't lose your sheets. You'll never get'em back 2. It is likely your teacher won't teach, therefore make do with smart I.T. people in your class. 3. Attempting to write a report when you do not know the necessary tasks to complete can be fatal. If (and probably when) your teacher ignores you and doesn't tell you what to do, make do by doing the same things everyone else in your class is doing. 4. When a task requires a certain amount of time, half it to receive the actual allocated time slot. 5. When your computer breaks, don't smash it. It won't start working. More likely, parts will fall off and the power supply may explode. 6. If conversation is not allowed during the task, assume taling is fine. 7. If conversation is allowed in class, assume copying is fine. 8. If the task must be completed at school/workplace etc., assume taking it home and working on it secretly is fine. 9. Assume you are allowed to do anything when the teacher is in the office staring at a computer screen faced away from you. 10. In conclusion, assume all computers don't work, assume no disks work, assume things to be stolen, assume it's okay to steal, assume the teacher doesn't care, assume you will not finish in the allocated time, assume that the amount of effort put in to the task has no relationship to the score you receive and finally don't do VET IT if you aren't doing it already.
