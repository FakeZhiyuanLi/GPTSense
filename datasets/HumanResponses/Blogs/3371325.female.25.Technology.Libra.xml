      I had a great evening last night.  First going to Jeff's brother's birthday gathering with his family...whom I just adore.  His mother and father are so sweet and thoughtful...and his grandma..Ohh I love that woman! She's in her 80's and loves to talk (much like myself).  You should hear her.....she says the funniest things.  She turned to Jeff last night and said.."Sarah has a really nice bustline you know?" ha ha ..he just laughed and said "Yeah,  You said that before.." She holds nothing back and is a strong woman.  I like that.   She also has a great sense of style at her age.  She was wearing this very nice ensemble last night.  I absolutely loved it on her.  I wanna dress just like her when I am her age.  You know how old people usually wear clothing that looks like it should be on a 4 year old?  Well,  not her....she  knows exactly what to wear....not too old and not too young.... just right.  I told Jeff I can only hope to have such a great sense of style at that age.  One thing I do know for sure is I will never be caught dead in "holiday promotional wear"....you know the kind.....skeleton earings.that make "scary" noises....homemade sparkle bat t-shirts...that glow in the dark...or the ohh so common....candy cane earings....with santa sweaters...and.... jingle bells...can't leave them out . I'm serious.  I hope I don't sound mean...but fo' reall. Even at a young age...elementary school....when teachers of mine wore stuff like that..I somehow innately knew that it was just WRONG.  So wrong.  I don't mind socks though.  I actually like those.  I love holiday socks.  I just hope that isn't the beginning of the addiction for me.  Must limit myself to one pair of holiday socks every few years.  Prevention.  Anyway...way too much time spent on that.    Jeff, his brother, and I went and saw "Supersize me" in Royal Oak after dinner.  That movie was absolutely incredible. I  advise every last one of you to see it...so good.  He has three doctors,  and gets all kinds of tests done to document his health before going on a Macdonalds binge for 30 days, 3 meals  a day...as he continues seeing his doctors every week.  A couple weeks in the doctors were already telling him he must stop eating the kinds of foods he was eating. We're the fattest country in the world...and damn it...someone has to show who the culprits are.  I'm not going to ruin the movie for you though, but I will tell you that 6 weeks after that movie was shown at Sundance,  Macdonalds yanked the option of "Supersizing" any of their meals.  More recently,  they've introduced the "Go Active" meal...an adult version of the "Happy Meal", which is an attempt to fix a problem they think they are only "a part of"(them and the rest of the fast food  and junk food industry) and a way to keep their pockets filled.  Wait till you see where the chicken nuggets come from people....you have no idea...which reminds me.  I saw a couple picketers in front of a "KFC" today.  They were holding signs about how KFC mistreats their chickens and where they get them and what is in them...etc.  So gross....but was very fitting and comforting to me after seeing that movie last night.  As quoted from the movie..".its up to you...who would you rather see go?  You or them?"  They're not feeling bad about what they are doing to your health ( the people that will have heart conditions, liver failure,diabetesif they keep eating their food)...they're rolling in the big bucks?   Do you think they will stop out of the kindness of their own "healthy"(cause you know they won't eat their own food) heart?  NO!  Until we stop going there..taking our small children there...to get them hooked on that crap.....they will forever be there... like the drug dealers on the corner waiting to give you that first hit.  Wake up!! Ronald Macdonald is not cute....he is not even nice....he is anoying and evil like most clowns, and if Macdonalds portrayed him in the right light you would see that he is actually the  clown from Stephen King's "IT" .   Alright. Enough verbal diarrhea for the night.  I am going to get myself some hot tea and relax with the next toxic thing in this country.....TV.  Thas right...thas what I said.  All I need now is a Big Mac and I'm on my way to being one of the numbers keeping us Detroiters #2 on the obesity scale next to the Supersize me state of Texas!  YEE HA!

      Good and bad news...which one do you want first?  Okay,  I'll give you the bad news first.  My interview was cancelled for today.  Now for the good news.  It was rescheduled for next Tuesday.  After the lady apologized for cancelling on me ....she said "you worked for Marcia and Kirk?"  and I was like "Yeah,  I'm actually watching  Justine and Carl(their kids) tomorrow night, you know them"?  and she was like "Yeah, they used used our services through U of M...and were featured in the New York Times about us"  and I interrupted and said "Ohh yeah,  last summer talking about academics raising children,etc...I remember that article...I didn't know they used your services"  and she said University of Michigan, Chrysler,and others use their backup childcare services as well.  Then she said "Barbara and Mike (not giving the last names) sound familar too!"  and I told her "I knew they used their services as backup when I couldn't work a couple times".  She was very excited and said she looked forward to meeting me.  I asked what I should bring,  and she said driver's license, etc...and that they would pay me for the time I am there next Tuesday setting things up.  CrazY!!!  I was  hired on the spot and I'm just going in to fill out all the paperwork.  See what networking does for ya!  Now.....my next plan is to let the parents of the children I will be caring for know that I am done with school after a week long course in summer(Flash),  and I  am searching for an internship/job.  We'll see how it all goes down.   I'm looking forward to starting this job......I love meeting new people.    Going to Starbucks with my housemate CHen.(Chen is so funny and sweet. She's from Taiwan and she loves coffee and style..but more about her later)   She and I are going to celebrate me getting a job.  We are also going because we are addicted to their drinks....especially that strawberry n'cream drink they have out right now.  MMmmmmmmm.....

      Its the end of my school week and now the weekend begins.  In a sense.    Tomorrow I have another interview.  This time it is not for an internship opportunity but for a nanny position through a company that works for Ford.  In late January I left a nanny job with a family that  I worked for since last June, but because it clashed with my winter schedule I had to quit.  I watched as a 4 month old baby girl go from rolling over, to scooting, to crawling, and eventually to walking....and boy does it happen fast.  I also cared for her older brother who was 4 and very loving and kind.  I got very attached to them,  especially the baby girl who was so incredibly smart.  From 7:30 AM till 5:00 PM, 5 days a week I cared for her, played with her, sang and danced with her, and taught word/language associations to her.  Her first word was baby..and that was from me pointing to her picture everday saying it again and again.  Eventually I stopped and she picked it up from there.  After that..everytime she saw her picture on the ledge next to her high chair she would point with her tiny delicate finger saying "baby!" big baby smile across her face. I loved it!  In fact,  I found it fascinating to watch how quickly she was learning.  The amount of information a child learns at that age on into early childhood is amazing to me. Anyway.  I went through withdrawal after I left the job...feeling guilty etc.  But I know I helped shape who she is and who she will become no matter how insignificant it might seem.  No energy goes unwasted...especially love and nurturing.    So getting back to my interview tomorrow. I am hoping it will be a lot better than the phone interview I had the other day.  I feel a lot more confident since I have a lot of experience with children.  I need a job bad right now...and it is the best option for me momentarily.  Let me tell you a little bit about my past work experience.  At 18, I started working at Rouge Steel in Dearborn Michigan.Which is super funny to some,  because I am 5'3 and weigh 115 pounds.  More like 100 at the time I worked there though.  So picture a small girl wearing a hard hat bigger than her head, steel toe shoes with metatarsals, and green overalls with my name on them.  Ha ha  I worked at the factory for three years.  There I went from cleaning, to banding coils of steel, to inspecting them for defects, to driving hi-los, and even operating  overhead cranes(it was like a videogame up there).  Honestly,  despite the dirty work conditions(Rouge is Henry Ford days old) and God knows what floating around in the air besides graphite, etc......I liked working there.  Working there were some of the most interesting and intelligent people.  Some even had college degrees and decided they liked that work better than whatever it was they went to school for.  It was amazing witnessing the comraderie and brotherhood amongst the workers. I fit right in..I joked and bullshited with the best of them.    I even learned how to play tonk...a card game. But I didn't do it for money like some of the guys did.   I began daydreaming about making a documentary about working there...but never got the bravery to sneak in a video camera. The one thing I regret .  I did take pictures of people and some of the machinery..but very few.  I read the book "Rivethead" by Ben Hamper while working there and got some inspiration to do something....but like I said, I never did....only passing the book along to others to read....and never getting it back.  Which reminds me....I forgot to add that book to my favs list in my profile.  Ohh well.. You should check it out if you ever get the chance.  Michael Moore is the one who sort of gave him a chance writing and if you read the book you will see why.  Good bluecollar stuff.  Its the reality of factory life and you can even get a taste of what I experienced though his eyes.  Very similar to every factory workers life.     To shorten my work experience let me just list them.....after Rouge.....I was a store manager at the mall, a security officer at General Motors, a data entry specialist at a mortgage company(by far...the most tedious and lame), and finally...a nanny.  Where I get the most satisfaction and joy.   Ok...I gotta end this....I hear a weird noise and am scared a tornado could be coming. Its storming out and ohh my God.  So scared.     Later-

      Well,  where shall I start.  After setting this thing up I realized two things.......first,  that I messed up the name in my address....my original idea was "squareroundbox" ....but I quickly wrote it and typed "circle" in place of round. Both being the same thing.....but one sounded a tad bit "cooler". And we all know thats what matters the most now now don't we?  Secondly,  I typed the address so darn fast that I mispelled the word "square".  I'll bet you never noticed that until I told you though.  I didn't either until it was pointed out to me. *Sigh*    ~phone break~    *pretend jeopardy music is playing here*  Funny how quick the phone conversation looks to you the reader.  In reality it was about 10 minutes.   So pretend that was 10 minutes instead of the second it took for your eyes to jump down to the beginning of this paragraph.    Yesterday I skipped out on writing and since I am trying to be consistent with this I find it important that I rewind until I hit yesterday and play it through...skipping the everyday routine of...first I woke up...then I brushed my teeth...etc.  The sad part is....I do have a tendency to get into that much boring ass detail.   I'll try to refrain for the most part.  Yesterday my day started out with my 10:00 AM Negotiation Communication class. I have it four days a week and honestly find it rather tedious.  I'm not sure if it is the fact that it is in the morning or if it is the whole having to be social part that bugs me.  I think its a mixture of the two.  Then you throw in the fact that you have to "negotiate",  that just makes for some sweaty armpits lemme tell ya.  Four of us had to be union workers yesterday and three were management.....put the two together trying to negotiate wages, subcontracting, and union dues jargon and you have yourself some loud voices trying to talk over one another.  Today was better and we finally came to an agreement.  Next......I pumped myself up for a phone interview (internship opportunity) I had planned at 3:00 PM.  Got all my thoughts together....listened to some "Boards of Canada" mellowed out.  Its 3:00 PM phone rings....its Zane...yeah... kinda a cool name isn't it? Not cool enough for me to even consider it for one of my future kids though. Anyway, Zane tells me about the company....Zane tells me about the position....and finally Zane interviews me.  Everything went well in the opening and close....its just the bulk of it in the middle that I am a little worried about.  For those of you who have never had a phone interview....I suggest you have a computer in front of you in case you need to look anything up such as accounting lingo, especially if it is for a company that makes and sells tax and accounting software of which you will have to understand etc...that you should remember if you took a basic accounting class....but don't because it was years ago.  Also....make sure you don't ramble on about something only to get sidetracked and forget where it is you were going as well as what the question was...but become too embarrassed to ask instead just stoppping in your tracks and leaving a moment of uncomfortable silence and in this case....longwinded run-on sentences.   Not that it happened to me or anything.   Its just stuff that happens to other people I hear.  Just giving you a heads up is all. *hesitant laugh*  My mother and I went to dinner at the Grizzly Peak later in the night.  She finally wanted to use the gift certificate I gave her at Christmas.  Who better to share it with than the person who gave it to her in the first place.  The dinner was good.  But the dessert was spectacular.  Chocolate truffle cake with expresso ice cream.  Its gonna be at my wedding someday so come on out and have yourself a good time.  If you are not there to see me cry (gonna be the highlight)..then at least come for the orgasmic cake experience.  Thas right....thas what I said.    Or as herbal essences says it..."organic" experience.  But they have it all wrong you see.  Its the chocolate truffle cake that gives you that sensation....not the herbal essences.  Believe me....I tried it and it is false advertising!  BOYCOTT Herbal essences now!!!!     Went to Barnes and Noble after dinner  to browse and read a little.  My mom is on this Van Gogh kick....so she went straight for everything about Van Gogh.  I knew he cut off his ear....but I didn't know he did it for some prostitute he was seeing regularly.  Learn something new everday now don't we.   I can't believe that prostitute wanted him to pay up by giving his ear to her.  How desperate for food was she?  Diego Rivera ring any bells people?   That just about does it for yesterday.  Today was a lot less interesting since I fell asleep for a couple hours after my morning class, had to do some lab reports for my electricity class.....and then go to that from 5:30 till 8:30. *yawn* so not much to say about today.  Went by fast. like a current shooting through a circuit and me ending this post.   sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
