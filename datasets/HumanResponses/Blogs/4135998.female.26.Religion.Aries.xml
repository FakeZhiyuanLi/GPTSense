      Well, I was just thinking of mortality and the end of our simple lives. Also thinking of the future and what future generations will see. What their lives will be like. Will it be like a science fiction movie? Like will there be no people with glasses or no fat people ( oh god I wish!) and will they ever find a cure for the common cold or will they find a cure for cancer? Will cars change? I also think of how insignifigant my life is in the grand scheme of things like I just try to think of the galaxy and how huge it is and how small we actually are and why the human race even got here. Like I know God created us but it blows my mind when I think about the bigger picture of things and yet we are sooooo small. Like grains of sand in retrospective of the galaxies. We are small but yet we have the fight in us, the passion to live, the love that is in each of us. How our hearts can break and yet the ability to wage war with each other and kill each other in war and abortion. Be so loving yet so destructive at the same time. Man, it blows my mind!!! The future will always be interesting to me, like I think of my parents and that my mom had never gotten a tv till she was 13 and she used to go to sock hops and she listened to Elvis when he first came out, like that blows my mind in itself. So I wonder when our children ask us about Nirvana or September 11th and that there was no computers when we were young.LOL!! Ok enough rambling!!!!XOXOXO

        I was just thinking of how music has changed over my lifetime. Like how when I was really young there was records and I listened to the Cabbage Patch Kids records and such and then 8 tracks when I listened to BJ Thomas and Evie in my parents cars (Mercuries) because they actually had 8 track players and then cassettes were huge and I bought a lot of them when I was 10-13 or 14 and then cd's and now the computer age has hit us and now everything is digital and itune players will be had by all so I'm wondering what will be next after this or is this the end of technology(HAHA as if!). SO it'll be exciting to see what happens and the generation gap between me and my parents widen by the years as my mom is completely computer illiterate and she hates computers. But my dad is hip and he gets jiggy with his computer. So it's awesome to see the elders getting into it!!

         Ooooooh today is a perfect day to read a book!! Nice and cool and kinda looks like it's going to rain. I remember when I stayed with the Mennonites (for 5 years) they had great days like this and on the farm after chores we would read out loud a really cool story and we would all listen while knitting or drawing. Sigh, I'm totally reminiscing, LOL! It seems like a dream so long ago.......Well, this weekend is shaping up to be pretty good. I have a Bday party to go to of a family friend and relative through marriage. He is turning 65 and he is my Sis-in-Laws dad. Wow, that sounds like a Jerry Springer episode.....haha. Then my sister is going up to my parents on Saturday so it'll be nice to see her again. As long as she stays on my good side!!Mwaaa haha!! YOu know how it is with siblings.............

      This is the Port Elgin Beach on Lake Huron. This is where I grew up till I was 9. This is where I played and went down that yellow slide many, many times when I was a child. swam for the first time right there. The fries there were awesome but the Seagulls would steal them all!!!   urlLink     urlLink

      Well, I don't know exactly what I'm thinking about but I really want a Starbucks coffe....A Venti Caffee Mocha!! Yummmmmmm!!! I went home for lunch and had boring soup for lunch and to watch a snippet of All My Children. It's funny how you can watch it once a week and find that the story is still the same. Soap Operas are so dumb and boring. I don't know why I bother!!! But I need to find out what happens to Bianca and her baby and that she gets him back and that Babe will realize that it is actually Biancas baby!! LOL!! So funny........ I also had a good report today that my niece became a Christian and she accepted Jesus into her heart because I had asked her if she had ever done that. And she said she had so that is quite exciting!!

      Oh man!! I wait in anticipation all week for this beautiful day, but this week not only is it Friday but it is also payday. So I could whatever I want!!HEHE!! Well, then reality hits and I have to pay bills!!Awwwww......oh well. Poor little me, Waa!Waa!! Tear tear........cry!! I can barely see the screen right now as my eyes are still puffy from this morning and I haven't drunken my entire coffee as of yet so I am waiting for that to kick in. I was out late last night because the gang and I went to see The Village by M.Night Shamalayan and it was AWESOME! I highly recommend it to anybody! The one part in the movie made me scream out loud and I think I scared everyone worse than the movie did, but it was really scary and you know how loud theatres are nowadays!! Anyways it was great.

      Hmmmm, I'm sitting here thinking I should write about something but I can't really think of anything............. Well, I'm having tons of fun with my digital cam and blogging and I really enjoy it and taking random pictures is so fun and I don't really care if people get annoyed with me (mwaa ha ha ha) that means you Jay!!! LOL! It's such a beautiful day with nice warm weather with a cool breeze...this is my kind of weather and I heard that down in Texas they get 110 degrees weather!! I can't believe it! I would absolutely DIE! I guess having an air conditioner would be mandatory there. But I would rather have the heat than having tornados like in Oklahoma (Mike and Wendy!). I would love to have a day off like this and go walk down at the Lake Shore but I am reserved to going down in the evening. Me and my roomie Laurie went to Starbucks one night and went down to the Lakeshore and chatted for a couple of hours about our child hood and how we listened to Psalty the Singing Song book.....LOL!! OMG!!What fun!! Going down to the Lakeshore and chilling is part of a right of passage to live here in Toronto as well as going to the CN Tower and seeing a Jays game as well. But this year I am dreaming of Toronto Maple Leaf tickets but with the strike looming I may have to wait awhile on that one. But its so weird living here in the Metropolis of Toronto as I grew up in a town of 4600 named Walkerton. I mean Toronto is massive!! SO big and with so much to do in it! I love it! I seem to be liking it more and more as time passes and it is relitavely safe too I guess. But it rocks!

        Oh man!!     What am I going to do? BB5 is on tonight and I am drumming tonight, I guess I could go ahead and program my archaic VCR. My god!! Who uses such archaic machinery anymore. I have a ton of videos collecting dust on my shelf with the tape inside them rotting away day by day!LOL! DVD's have taken over in a big way but I guess I'll just have to trash them or give them away......Maybe I'll bring them to work and write FREE on a box and put it in the Lobby and I'm sure a lot of them will disappear. SO anyways I better go program my VCR and get the show I need for my yet another addiction!!LOL! Well, actually I look forward to this show every summer and they always come up with a new twist and this year its the "Project DNA"(I say in a loud thunderous voice). Its where they have a set of twins competing in this and they are trading off or taking turns and no one is the wiser and if they can pull it off both of the twins will enter the house for competition.........Now, there are 2 other twins in the house and they have identical twins as well so what I'm figuring is that the other twins will enter the house as well. But you never know!!!!!!!!!! Oh that crazy world of Big Brother!!! At least the host looks like she ate a sandwich or 2 over the past year and she doesn't look as emanciated as last year. I was worried for her as she got skinnier and skinnier over the last season. She looks healthier now....... WOW!! Am I ever obsessed with this show!!LOL!!! LOVE, PEACE, AND GROOVY TIMES!!!

           OMG!! Timmies is so addictive. It's so weird because I watched a documentry about Timmies coffee and other coffies and they scientifically proved there is nothing addictive like nicotine in their coffee and oddly enough, Second Cup Coffee has the highest caffeine ratio...........So why is Timmies so addictive? A voodoo hex? a curse from a Columbian coffee god? or what?? Why am I addicted? Also why are there so many like me that are also addicted to it?       I once heard a joke that you are a true Canadian if you can balance a coffee and drive while smoking a cigarrette and if you are a TRUE ,TRUE ,HARDCORE Canadian, you can smoke while drinking a Timmies while talking on a cell phone!!!LOL!!        HAHA!! Well, I don't know about that but I love Their coffee so yummy and coffee-like and so much caffeine that it makes me happy like a schoolgirl!!!

      Sigh!! So here is my music blog as I need to tell of my love for music. It's hard to describe as I play drums and guitar and lead worship myself but I have always had a special connection to music ever since I was a little girl. Always listening to the beat especially which is probably why I took up drums as my primary instrument. But the funny thing was, I was raised in a very strict christian environment where no TV or Radio was allowed when I was young. But I did smuggle in some Cranberries and Madonna and stuff like that and I was eventually allowed to listen to DC Talk and the Newsboy(who I still love). But Music has always been the forbidden fruit and something that I've always loved sooooooooo much. But anyhoo I am listening to Avril Lavigne's new cd and it is so good. She is such a good songwriter and musician for being so young and she is CANADIAN!!! OW!!!! I would go see her live but I can just imagine all the little kids that will be there screaming their heads off!!LOL!! I'm too old to do that! I'll stick to my Bowie and Radiohead concerts!   urlLink http://bmgkepek.uw.hu/images/bigones/avril_lavigne_06.jpg

         I'm still on this thing about the complaining. But I talked to a friend about it and she really inspired me to keep a positive attitude and the change may start with ME!!!    But the thing is I am affected by things that are around me, say like my environment at home or at work. I need to feel the love and I love to feel the love and hug and touch and positive words and giving thanks in all things. Like I said before I nedd to change this myself and be positive and the outcome will be different and I will try and make people happy around me and I know that some people might think this is a masking of true feelings. But I really feel it is a vital part of our life to keep happy and think positive things and try to thank God for all the beauty around us.    I just watch Joni Erickson Tada  urlLink http://www.joniandfriends.org/ last night on Larry King Live. For those of you who don't know who she is, she had a diving accident when she was young that left her quadrapalegic(sp?) and she gives thanks to God each day even though she may wake up not feeling good but she asks God to help her face the day. She is an inspiration to me in this area.    Anyways I think we could have a lot more serious things to complain and moan about, say if we lost our sight or mobility and such. So GIVE THANKS!!! Thank you God!!! You are awesome and I love you!!

          Augh!!!!!!!!!           Nothing bugs me more than someone who thinks the world revolves around them and they think that anyone that they run into during the day in public that they can unload on them.           What I mean is complaining about stuff from morning till night. God give me grace to deal with this situation. I mean we are to be examples of Jesus and give mercy to people. I know I'm not perfect as well. But I mean give people a break!!!!AUGH!!!

         I recently attended the TACF Leaders School of Ministr  urlLink www.tacf.org  and it was sooooooooo awesome!!! God did so much and I met lots of new friends from all over the world. Such as Germany, France, Netherlands, etc. It has been sooooo awesome.    You see the school is for Christian people who have been in leadership and such and you learn about the love of God and all that he has for you and you learn to Communicate with God more and get those things healed up in your heart from past hurts and the prophetic and the Father Heart of God and how much He loves you.    There is nothing I can do but let Him love me and there is always hope because of that and no matter how crappy I'm feeling and how I'm struggling with things in my life I know that God loves me and He will forever no matter what I say and do!!!!

      Well this is new to me! My name is Christa and I wanted to start a blog as I just got a cool Digital camera and I like to have fun with it. So I am looking forward to posting pics of me and my friends and my family. As you probably know the name of my Blog is TVC1515 and that is because I love David Bowie and his music so I'll probably write a lot about him and put pics up too. I also love Newsboys, U2, Beatles, and Radiohead. I am a musician and I love music of all sorts so I think that a lot of what I talk about will be about music. Speaking of, I play drums tonight at TACF, a wicked church here near the airport where I also work. Ok more later!!! Christa.
