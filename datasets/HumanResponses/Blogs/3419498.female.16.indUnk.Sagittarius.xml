      Well. Talk about happy stuffs. Like...   Gee I can't think of anything.  Okay.  Concentrate .  Er. I'm goin shopping 2nite!   Is that all?  Unfortunately, yes. I shud learn to be thankful for everything I have. Actually I'm a really lucky gal. But I just don't have a positive mind.   *growls*  C'mon. List 5 things that shud make me happy. 1. I'm home. 2. I'm going shopping. 3. I'm free from dat school for almost 4 weeks. 4. I can go online as long as I want. 5. I have JESUS. Oh please,  please , make my faith grow stronger. I really need it at the moment.  ~*~

      Aiya. Just came back from my (old) school. I got dis feeling again. Left out. lonely. Well, not their fault. And not my fault as well. It's just a natural thing that will happen no matter how hard u try to stay close with 'em, and I shud understand. But I can't! I'm not even close to my bestest friend anymore. Gee. Great. I have no real friends.   ~*~

      What's Corona Australis?   Abbreviation:  CrA  English name:  Southern Crown   A small constellation of the southern hemisphere. It lies at the south-western edge of Sagittarius, north of Telescopium. As Corona Australis is located at the edge of the Milky Way it is still an interesting constellation for observations although it is so small. On 25th of September 1997 the Hubble Space Telescope sends a picture of a neutron star alone in space located in this constellation.    Mythological Background   According to "The Night Sky" by Ian Ridpath this constellation was known to the ancient Greeks (despite of its very southern location). Their legends said that Corona Australis is the crown of the neighboring centaur, Sagittarius.     From http://www.seds.org/Maps/Stars_en/Fig/coronaaustr.html
