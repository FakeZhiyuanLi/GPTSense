      This is a reminder to you guys. On June 4-5, 1944 (60 years ago), American paratroopers landed in France to prepare for the beach landings. Allied bombing had began overnight but it did little good... It was more like a sign that said: "Hitler we are coming". The 82nd and 101st airborne divisions landed in France first. Securing key towns, towns Vierville and Sainte-Merie Glise. The British 6th Airborne division and the first Canadian parachute battalion parachuted in the river Orne. The paratrooper landings were very important as they protected the left and right flanks of the main invasion site. There were give codenames for the beach landings: Gold, Sword, Juno, Utah, and Omaha.  More information will come each day about this historical event. The day that the Allies speared into Hitler's war machine.

      Okay, my laptop was well... acting up again like it always does after 4 weeks of use (funny, its almost  ALWAYS  4 weeks that it starts to act up!) so here I went reinstalling Windows XPee. Okay, this is the BAD part. I neglected to install Anti-viral software and set up the Windows XP firewall (before I installed Zone Alarm). I thought I turned it on... but anyyway... DANG! Blaster hit my computer today! All because I forgot to put up a firewall! I Swear those worms are a pain in the arse! Blaster is worse than Sasser... sasser was pretty easy to stop. n00bish compared to Blaster. Blaster kept crashing my laptop. Without a way to get rid of it, I just reinstalled Windows XPee again... ugh. So what does this mean? 4 hours of my summer wasted because of a stupid worm!!!! UGHHHH >. I SWEAR that person who made Blaster should be kept in solitary confinement or some bad thing happen! geez... Moving right long with life.... :whistles:

(DARN YOU 7th and 8th graders!!! note that their history and english tests are integrated so they dont take another test tomorrow... but then again I guess its good to take it steady and study one at a time and not have english and history thrown at you at once ;-) )  (Credit: Kate for the word HUZZAH!)

      Well back from Rui's form party. I must say things were ok from the start and went downhill from there (I won't go into any details). However, after our party was reduced to Will, Shiv, Rui, Molly, Jenny, Wyn, Rose, and I things went pretty smooth and fun ;-). Kinda sucks, because of this event our form like split up more (or basically did the opposite of what it was supposed to do). I say "darn you lucky b@$tards" who stayed at home and didn't come! You guys really did not miss a thing.

      Well things are going pretty well I guess. E3 buzzing around, seems like Half Life 2 and Medal of Honor Pacific Assault are both turning into very sweet games from the expo (see last three posts from today lol). Also official websites seemed to have been launched for them. Finals looming near. Only 2 weeks left of school (1wk before finals) holy s**t looks like I need to start studying the s**t out of my brain this weekend. Biology and Geometry are the ones that concern me right now (Biology starts way back in what chapter 16 or was it 26 or 20? It starts with DNA anyhoo =P) and Geometry well i'm kinda worried about proofs since I don't put much effor into them =P. Meh. Too bad. 2 weeks until school is over. 2 weeks until I leave seabury. Then its off to Freestate!  ... Let the studying begin!

      Valve has launched the official Half Life 2 website today. http://www.half-life2.com/ From PlanetHalfLife:  Shacknews is reporting this afternoon from E3 that Half-Life 2 multiplayer is Counter-Strike:  Half-Life 2 multiplayer is Counter-Strike on the Source engine and will be available at the same time as when Half-Life 2 ships. Counter-Strike gameplay doesn't seem to have changed much, if at all. Graphics of course, are much improved. Stay tuned for more info!  Correction: Shacknews did not report that Half-Life 2 Multi would be Counter-Strike 2, only that it is "Counter-Strike on the Source engine". The email sent to me made this assertion, although the Shacknews post does not.  And Also Gamespy has released 700MB+ Video showing Half Life 2 footage at E3

       urlLink EAMedal of Honor Pacific Assault Official Website  Gamespy MOHPA Preview:  In this regard Pacific Assault is truly topnotch, offering extensive operations at hard fought locations including Guadalcanal, New Georgia, and Tarwa. The campaign will still be linear, but this time the individual missions will offer greater non-linear options with multiple ways of accomplishing the key objectives. Of course, the game will still have the big cinematic moments that almost venture on over-the-top to the point of becoming surreal, but the fun should be equally non-stop.   Looks like things just keep getting better!

      Good day at school! also an interesting one too! Got a 90 on that Henry V paper (wrote it the night before... well... at least the last two paragraphs) and I can say that that is a miracle! Also in Bio I gave Mike $1 and he ate a spoonfull of mud. I say its really worth the money. If you haven't seen it yet, you can find it in my website under the Low-Res video section

      Heh awesome. I finally know how to use Medal of Honor: Spearhead's mapping SDK. I got some pretty cool stuff in mind such as trech warfare in a winter setting, where there are 4 trenches, two on each team, no man's land covered with hedgehogs, machine guns on the first treches facing each other, and 4 artillery pieces on each opposing side. Sound fun? Heck yeah. After that's done, i'm thinking of making single player missions as soon as I can learn some scripting. You won't go alone, instead you'll have an 8 man squad fighting along side you and yeah, the trech fight multiplayer map will be a single player mission, only larger ;-). There will be other things such as tank warfare where you drive a T34 and lead other T34s to capture a bridge held by a king tiger brigade and such. Some other examples? Well how about a fort siege with a company. YOu would need to defend your tanks in order to break into the fort while being pinned down in the trenches from enemy MG42 fire. Of course you would be the sole team's sniper and you would need to take out panzerschrecks aiming at your captured tanks. Hmm... that's all I have in mind right now so far. I am actually making that tank warfare level as we speak. Heh got nothing better to do. So for now, peace y'all

      URRG, I had to re-install Windows XP yesterday! For al you people who haven't re-installed or haven't experienced re-installation, its one big major pain in the @$$. What's worse is that my backups are gone! I could only recover 1 conversation from the backup CD from one with my previous friends! The backup I uploaded on the internet turned out to be an OLDEr VERSION ALTHOUGH I UPLOADED A VERSION WITH ALL THE CURRENt SAVED CONVOS. ARGH. On the lighter side MSN's backups worked out fine. God this makes me so pissed! I HATE COMPUTERS (gasp! Did I just say that?!)

      Yo watch it ya'll! The Venus Transit is a rare event when Venus is visible from the Earth passing the sun. The last time it happened was 1882. If you don't see it tomorrow the next time you'll be able to see it is 2012 on June 8 and the next... well... you won't be alive then. Until Dec. 11 2117... hey... that's the day of my 129th birthday! . What a great gift it would be  assuming I won't be a corpse until that day. Anyhoo for more info go here: http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/watchtheskies/venus_transit.html  If you miss it, they'll show replays on the internet  It happens tomorrow btw so watch it!

      Man this is so boring! No one's online. Meh. Summers I tell ya. Used to be so fun until your die hard habits start to change and become a tad more social. *sigh* I guess my time has come. Time to leave this boring old place. Time to leave it all behind once and for all!    ....    ....   ....  Helllloooooo computer gaming! Yes, it seems my old habits are returning! If I may suggest, DO NOT get the game Hidden and Dangerous 2! It sucks! or maybe its just because i'm not used to tactical First Person Shooters. Yeah probably. I'm more of the run-and-gun, kick-down-the-door take no prisoners type of guy when it comes to FPSs. Stealth works for me as well too. But I prefer the whole "work alone" than "work as a team" type thing. Heh if I joined the army i'd be 0ne 5crw3d son of a b-. Harry Potter (the vid game) is OK I guess. I still like reading the books. Nothing beats reading the books than watching that stupid movie (god I hate the movies!). The video games are okay. I played the first one on a PS and the Chamber of Secrets Demo (geez a Radeon VE Based gfx adapter running it at 1024x768 without much lag! That's INSANE) So here I am about to hit the beaches of Omaha Beach in Medal of Honor Allied Assault. From the looks of the different MOH versions, PS2's Omaha beach (MOH:F) I say is more fun. You actually get to shoot at the pillboxes and do something other than run. Oh well. SOme people say Omaha Beach is the hardest mission. For me its the eaisest. Okay maybe it gets a bit hard when you're playing it at 640x480 and the framerate is somewhere around 10-35fps on the shores =P Well enough blabbing. This is alpha zulu, signing off

      SUPREME HEADQUARTERS ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY FORCE  Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force!  You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.  Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is will trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.  But this is the year 1944! Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory!  I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory!  Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.

      This is a speech given by Patton the day before D-Day  Men, this stuff that some sources sling around about America wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight, is a crock of bullshit. Americans love to fight, traditionally. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle.   You are here today for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend your homes and your loved ones. Second, you are here for your own self respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are real men and all real men like to fight. When you, here, every one of you, were kids, you all admired the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the toughest boxer, the big league ball players, and the All-American football players. Americans love a winner. Americans will not tolerate a loser. Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American.   You are not all going to die. Only two percent of you right here today would die in a major battle. Death must not be feared. Death, in time, comes to all men. Yes, every man is scared in his first battle. If he says he's not, he's a liar. Some men are cowards but they fight the same as the brave men or they get the hell slammed out of them watching men fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who fights even though he is scared. Some men get over their fright in a minute under fire. For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes days. But a real man will never let his fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.   Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base. Americans pride themselves on being He Men and they ARE He Men. Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you are, and probably more so. They are not supermen.   All through your Army careers, you men have bitched about what you call "chicken shit drilling." That, like everything else in this Army, has a definite purpose. That purpose is alertness. Alertness must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a fuck for a man who's not always on his toes. You men are veterans or you wouldn't be here. You are ready for what's to come. A man must be alert at all times if he expects to stay alive. If you're not alert, sometime, a German son-of-an-asshole-bitch is going to sneak up behind you and beat you to death with a sockful of shit! There are four hundred neatly marked graves somewhere in Sicily, all because one man went to sleep on the job. But they are German graves, because we caught the bastard asleep before they did.   An Army is a team. It lives, sleeps, eats, and fights as a team. This individual heroic stuff is pure horse shit. The bilious bastards who write that kind of stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real fighting under fire than they know about fucking! We have the finest food, the finest equipment, the best spirit, and the best men in the world. Why, by God, I actually pity those poor sons-of-bitches we're going up against. By God, I do.   My men don't surrender, and I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he has been hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight back. That's not just bull shit either. The kind of man that I want in my command is just like the lieutenant in Libya, who, with a Luger against his chest, jerked off his helmet, swept the gun aside with one hand, and busted the hell out of the Kraut with his helmet. Then he jumped on the gun and went out and killed another German before they knew what the hell was coming off. And, all of that time, this man had a bullet through a lung. There was a real man!   All of the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters, either. Every single man in this Army plays a vital role. Don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. Every man has a job to do and he must do it. Every man is a vital link in the great chain. What if every truck driver suddenly decided that he didn't like the whine of those shells overhead, turned yellow, and jumped headlong into a ditch? The cowardly bastard could say, 'Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands.' But, what if every man thought that way? Where in the hell would we be now? What would our country, our loved ones, our homes, even the world, be like? No, Goddamnit, Americans don't think like that. Every man does his job. Every man serves the whole. Every department, every unit, is important in the vast scheme of this war. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns and machinery of war to keep us rolling. The Quartermaster is needed to bring up food and clothes because where we are going there isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last man on K.P. has a job to do, even the one who heats our water to keep us from getting the 'G.I. Shits.'   Each man must not think only of himself, but also of his buddy fighting beside him. We don't want yellow cowards in this Army. They should be killed off like rats. If not, they will go home after this war and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the Goddamned cowards and we will have a nation of brave men. One of the bravest men that I ever saw was a fellow on top of a telegraph pole in the midst of a furious fire fight in Tunisia. I stopped and asked what the hell he was doing up there at a time like that. He answered, 'Fixing the wire, Sir.' I asked, 'Isn't that a little unhealthy right about now?' He answered, 'Yes Sir, but the Goddamned wire has to be fixed.' I asked, 'Don't those planes strafing the road bother you?' And he answered, 'No, Sir, but you sure as hell do!' Now, there was a real man. A real soldier. There was a man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty might appear at the time, no matter how great the odds.   And you should have seen those trucks on the road to Tunisia. Those drivers were magnificent. All day and all night they rolled over those son-of-a-bitching roads, never stopping, never faltering from their course, with shells bursting all around them all of the time. We got through on good old American guts.   Many of those men drove for over forty consecutive hours. These men weren't combat men, but they were soldiers with a job to do. They did it, and in one hell of a way they did it. They were part of a team. Without team effort, without them, the fight would have been lost. All of the links in the chain pulled together and the chain became unbreakable.   Don't forget, you men don't know that I'm here. No mention of that fact is to be made in any letters. The world is not supposed to know what the hell happened to me. I'm not supposed to be commanding this Army. I'm not even supposed to be here in England. Let the first bastards to find out be the Goddamned Germans. Someday I want to see them raise up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl, 'Jesus Christ, it's the Goddamned Third Army again and that son-of-a-fucking-bitch Patton.' We want to get the hell over there." The quicker we clean up this Goddamned mess, the quicker we can take a little jaunt against the purple pissing Japs and clean out their nest, too. Before the Goddamned Marines get all of the credit.   Sure, we want to go home. We want this war over with. The quickest way to get it over with is to go get the bastards who started it. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we can go home. The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo. And when we get to Berlin, I am personally going to shoot that paper hanging son-of-a-bitch Hitler. Just like I'd shoot a snake!   When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a German will get to him eventually. The hell with that idea. The hell with taking it. My men don't dig foxholes. I don't want them to. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep moving. And don't give the enemy time to dig one either. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and by showing the Germans that we've got more guts than they have; or ever will have. We're not going to just shoot the sons-of-bitches, we're going to rip out their living Goddamned guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun cock suckers by the bushel-fucking-basket.   War is a bloody, killing business. You've got to spill their blood, or they will spill yours. Rip them up the belly. Shoot them in the guts. When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt off your face and realize that instead of dirt it's the blood and guts of what once was your best friend beside you, you'll know what to do!   I don't want to get any messages saying, 'I am holding my position.' We are not holding a Goddamned thing. Let the Germans do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy. We are going to go through him like crap through a goose; like shit through a tin horn!   From time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing our people too hard. I don't give a good Goddamn about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push, the more Germans we will kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that.   There is one great thing that you men will all be able to say after this war is over and you are home once again. You may be thankful that twenty years from now when you are sitting by the fireplace with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what you did in the great World War II, you WON'T have to cough, shift him to the other knee and say, 'Well, your Granddaddy shoveled shit in Louisiana.' No, Sir, you can look him straight in the eye and say, 'Son, your Granddaddy rode with the Great Third Army and a Son-of-a- Goddamned-Bitch named Georgie Patton!'    "That is all."
