      well here i am, jessitots, or call me jimmy...  i'm sitting in my computer room of my boarding school at 8:30 in the morning , stressing that i'm not stressed about my exam in half an hour... so ive only got two more sleeps till its HOLIDAYS!! i just cant wait! its killing me, slowly killing me, the wait until i can just let all loose... well, i have to concerntrate a little more, ive got bio this arvo, i'm dreading it coz i know i should do really well, and yet i dont think im going to do as well as i hope. its my friend, Luke's birthday today, so im waiting till he gets here, so i can give him a big hug!  i love hugs... before i moved here, my worst fear was that i wouldnt have any hugs. for those of u wondering where i'm from,ill tell the story one more time... once upon a time, i was born in australia, then my dad, who is a pilot, was working in papua new guinea, so i moved there for the first two years of my very much appreciated life.  after my time in the land of cannibals, i moved with my family to a place called vanuatu, then i was blessed with a most annoying little sister, who i happen to love dearly now... anyways, i live in vanuatu for 6 years, then my dearest father, decided to move to a place called Burma, now called Myanmar. well while he was over there, my mother,sister and i lived in oz for only 18 months, as Myanmar did not have a school. we then moved to thialand, so my dad could commute for 4 out of 7 days of the week. this arrangement was in opperation for 3 years, or maybe 2.5?? well anyways, then we all packed up and moved to Mauritius, which is the most amazing country, i lived there or 4.5 years... it was amazing, i loved it. well now my family all live in mauritius, while i live in a boarding school in Victoria, Australia. why boarding school? well am really passionate to be a vet, and need to do the best i can, and this school is going to bring the best out of me, well.. so they say.. anyways, i have to go to registration, and prove to everyone that i exist today. well wish me luck in my dreaded literature exam... yuck... and thanks to a fantastic HARRY, for introducing me to the wonderful world of blogger...

      well, as the title suggests, this is just some day to day crap. i just had a tennis 'lesson', not really a lesson, just sitting at the tennis courts, watching the rain... hmm interesting. well i found out only the other day, that my dog shelly was picked up by the pound in mauritius, and put down... while my family was in australia, and hence could do nothing about it... i am really upset and i really cant beliefe that shelly is gone.... whats worse is that my other dog jasper is really miserable, and keeps looking for her... anyways... on to something a little less depressing. i'm going on a 'duke of edinburough' "expedition" to some place called French island, where we will be working out arses off the entire time! yay!! schools going ok, not much happening, just a lot of work to be handed in... when?.. oh yeah.. TOMORROW!!! shit. well as for my 'guy' life, not much happening there.. i havent really been in contact with will since i got back, and i've kinda gone off the other one.. i dunno, i guess i just dont feel like getting involved with anyone at the mo. maybe its coz im not feeling so fantastic about myself, seeing as ive put on so much weight!!! ah well, i ll soon get rid of it all. i'm really missing wesley at the moment, i keep thinking about him... its so hard to concentrate on not thinking bout him! anyways, gotta go
