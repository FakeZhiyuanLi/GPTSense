       urlLink The Department of Homeland Security has raised the terror threat level today.  Tom Ridge, Secretary of Homeland Security, announced in a press conference today that the terror threat level has been raised because of credible evidence from numerous sources that al-Qaida is trying to attack key financial centers in NYC, Northern NJ and Washington D.C.  So what's different this time? Well several things:        This is not the usual chatter. This is multiple sources that involve extraordinary detail -Tom Ridge        Ridge has stated that the means of the attacks are truck bombs and or car bombs. Previously the means of the attack have not been stated.         Specific targets have been named.       For more information read the  urlLink press conference.     -Nick

      I found this interesting article while perusing the usual sites. I find the report similar to the way in which I look at the situation in Iraq. I encourage everyone to read the entire article as the man has been on the ground recently. Here is an excerpt:           These are painful observations for me to make, because in early April, I wrote on this page that the media had been underplaying the good things happening in Iraq, and were missing the potential for a turnaround.   I still believe the first part. But when I returned to Iraq in June, I found that the situation had deteriorated so dramatically that a lot of those good things have become irrelevant.    Entire article  urlLink here.    This article raises an interesting point, and that is that the mainstream media has an inability to accurately report the war in any fashion. The mainstream media has proven itself useless in the past few years, with its live coverage of the "War on Terror" and the wars in A'stan and Iraq. What we see on CNN, Fox, CNBC, or any other mainstream media outlets is not news, it is a sensationalized representation of events. Otherwise known as  entertainment.  What we see on these mainstream  entertainment  channels is not coverage from the "frontlines", no matter how badly Christiane Amanpour wants us to believe. Reporting from the Mustafa hotel in Kabul is not reporting from the "frontline". Reporting from the Green zone in Baghdad, is not reporting from the "frontline". Not to mention that the wars we currently face do not usually involve frontlines in the sense that most of us know. A'stan may be the exception here, but certainly not Iraq. The media would rather dazzle its audiences with footage of "Shock and Awe", than portray accurate reports from the ground, mostly because the "reporters" from the mainstream entertainment organizations are too afraid to report, that job is left up to a small group of real journalists searching for the truth. I must say though, it made for some good entertainment, just like going to the movies, grab some popcorn, a soda and recline. Nothing like watching Baghdad get pounded by precision guided missiles! Reminds me of the Fourth of July! Too bad none of the mainstream entertainment stations have the gall to show wounded soldiers, or wounded civilians. Instead, we may see a 10 second clip of a car-bombing with a 30 second analysis of the situation by someone who has never been in Iraq, let alone ever spoken to an Iraqi.  Part of the responsibility of the mainstream entertainment outlets, and if they want to be referred to as news outlets, is to address the credibility issues that they face. Selling stories through sensationalization is not a credible practice, nor is it respectable. And it should not be considered as either. An excellent example of such practice was the coverage of the Abu Grhaib prison scandal. At the beginning of the coverage the story was a testament to how powerful and important journalism is. However, as soon as the entertainment outlets got a hold of it, they did not let go, and they milked it for everything it was worth. This type of coverage distorts the overall picture of the situation. And does nothing for our troops on the ground. That is not to say the story was without merit, nor is it to say that it did not deserve attention, but what happened here is a prime example of a sensationalism of events.  The best that the mainstream entertainment outlets are good for is opinions, and even at that, they fall short. For an example of this, recall the 'debate' between Michael Moore and Bill O'reilly during the Democratic National Convention. In the 'debate', nothing but pure entertainment was accomplished. As an interesting sidenote, recall the hype that went into selling the Democratic National Convention, namely on CNN. The hype to sell the   Republican National Convention   has already begun.  This being said, it's not all bad.         For those of you who want to know what it is like to read real journalism, here is Daniel Smith's story,  urlLink  Iraq Diary  . You see Daniel was actually on the ground speaking with real people. This is part one of the three part series that will be out on my site. Check back for the next two segments. The story is beyond incredible. Expect an interview with Daniel in the weeks to come.  -Nick

      It appears that a journalist in Iraq has been arrested for his harsh criticism of the controversial Iraqi congress, which he said represented the Iraqi people in an "unbalanced way".  Here's a caption from the WP:   Baghdad, Iraq, Aug. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. forces arrested the press official of the Committee of Muslim Ulemas, Iraq's highest Sunni religious authority, after participating in a televised debate.   The whole article can be viewed  urlLink here.   Details at this time are sketchy. More info will be posted as the story progresses.  -Nick

       The war in Iraq has proved to be a distraction from what's going on in Afghanistan. Important to note is that the Iraqis are watching the situation in A'stan carefully. The reason being is this; A'stan is similar in many respects (however, starkly different in some) to Iraq.  Reasons A'stan and Iraq are similar:      Removed two regimes from power     <>Working to create democratic governments and 'free' the people<>     <>Election processes are going to be quite similar in both countries.<>     <>Both processes will prove to be difficult    Reasons A'stan and Iraq are different:      A'stan had broad international support, Iraq did not.      Iraq was invaded pre-emptively and unilaterally.      We had a plan in A'stan, we did not and still do not have a clear and viable plan for Iraq.     We had a clear and defined reason for invading A'stan. The basis for war has changed several times and all but one justification have been proved to be false for invading Iraq.      We have widespread support in A'stan. Support in Iraq is, well, lets just say liking the US not very popular, unless you live in Kirkuk, and even that is shaky.    These are only a hand full of differences.  We have been largely successful with A'stan, militarily and in working with the local people. In Iraq, we encountered fierce resistance and are now fighting a growing and powerful insurgency.  One large problem the US faces is convincing the people of A'stan and namely Iraq that their new governments are credible and their leaders are not just puppets. Two examples in particular stick out in my mined. These two are the President of A'stan, Hamid Karzai and Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. Karzai was once a supporter of the Taliban, and is seen as a puppet controlled by the US gov't. Allawi is seen as an outsider as he was in exile during Saddam's brutal rule over Iraq. Lets try to make this simple. You have lived through Saddam's Iraq, then through the toppling of Saddam's regime, the transfer of 'soverneigty', through the insurgency, and now you have the chance to have a say in how your country is run, (relatively speaking, I'm a bit skeptical of the amount of power the new gov't actually affords) or so you think. Those positions are given to exiles instead, appointed by the US no less. So now someone who left the country during Saddam's regime has now come back to govern you. Doesn't seem fair sense you lived through the entire situation. So in thie sense many do not feel Iyad Allawi or the host of other exiles currently in the new gov't have the credentials to govern Iraq.  Back in A'stan the Taliban and al-Qaida are strong in the south and southeast. This is where the Taliban movement arose in the early 90s, so naturally their base of support is still held largely in the south. The situation needs to be watched carefully not only by Iraqis but by the citizens of the US. We need to demand that A'stan is given all of the funds and resources it needs (i.e, troops, food, money, etc.) in ensuring that A'stan does not fail. Failure in that country is not an option (like its ever been). The remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaida are trying their best to disrupt the election process. And recently a large aid organization has left the country due to its instability. A'stan is far better off than Iraq, but the situation needs to be watched carefully and Americans and the rest of the world need to do their job and demand that A'stan is not lost in the wake of Iraq.  -Nick

              Here is an excellent map of the wall that seperates Israel from the West Bank. If you look closely at the map you will notice that four entire towns are enclosed in the wall. These towns are: Sahalin, Hussan, Batir, and Walaja. The wall extends at some points, several miles into Palestian territory. The wall has afforded temporary peace to some great success. However, I am skeptical at the long term peace that this wall will be able to afford. It's got to come down at some point right? And when it does...  Some info on the wall:  urlLink  Israel wall will not follow the 1967 border.   Info on the conflict:   urlLink In depth information on the entire situation.

       urlLink    Sharon has "given the go ahead for 600 new homes [to be built] in the largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank.",  urlLink the BBC reports.   The question that needs to be posed here is this:  Will this help or hinder the long term peace process for the region? Unless my logic is flawed, then the answer is it will only hurt the already fragile (at best) situation.   In other news,  urlLink the US has has vetoed a UN resolution  (that link is from Oct. 2003) which would condemn Israels West Bank barrier. Since the issue of the wall is fiercely debated, opinions are usually thrown into "news" reports on the situation. So I will provide a few sources on the wall. It is best to read up on several sources, wade through the opinions, pick out the facts, and form your own opinions.

       urlLink    The New York Stock Exchange is seen as a target for terrorists belonging to al-Qaida. Among the alleged targets are the Prudential Financial building in Northern New Jersey, the financial district in NYC, namely Citigroup and the World Bank and the IMF in Washington D.C.  Not to fear though!  urlLink Ridge has told everyone to stay calm and had urged everyone to go about their daily lives!    Rest assured, rest assured that the most talented security professionals and law enforcement professionals around this country are working hard every single day to protect all regions of the country and all sectors of our economy. -Tom Ridge. To quote Robert Young Pelton, "Thanks Tom. But no thanks." I feel so much better now. Just kidding. Now, if Homeland Security wanted to do something really useful to ensure the safety of Americans at home, they would have taken stronger measures to secure our borders, our ports, our malls and the administration would be taking urgent and immediate steps towards adapting the measures put forth by the 9-11 Commision. Thus far,  urlLink these are the steps the administration has taken.   Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it seems that every time the threat level has been raised it has been in response to something that the presidential hopeful John Kerry has said, or in this case, in light of the recent Democratic National Convention.

       urlLink    Insurgents celebrate the destruction of an oil tanker shortly after the  urlLink transfer of soveriegnty.  Is this how the transfer of soveriegnty going to look? It has certainly played out that way thus far.  With more and more Iraqis questioning how much authority their new gov't actually has, and Kurds, Sunnis and Shi'ites fighting for control and in some cases fighting together against the US and coalition forces in Iraq, things aren't looking good.  So in some cases it may look like civil war is imminent as the CIA has  urlLink warned . And in others,  it may appear that they are uniting against the coalition. Either way the outcome looks terrible.  -Nick   urlLink

         I've been doing some reading lately on Kerry from this source:  urlLink Vote Smart; Senator John Forbes Kerry.   The site has Kerry's complete voting record for his entire career on the Senate. It is unbiased and is an invaluable resource. I would suggest reading up on any of the issues you are concerned about to see how he voted, or if he even showed up at all to vote.  I can not stress the importance of this site. It is a real joy to read through plain facts and be able to come to my own conclusions on the man, instead of having his voting record shoved down my throught by the Right wing.  I found this interesting video while perusing the usual sites.  urlLink Video.   Keep in mind that this video is from http://www.gop.com, and that these are only quotes and we do not hear the entire dialogue. However, it proves a point.

               urlLink  Here is a good introduction to the conflict.                        How did the conflict start?            The conflict began in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 after a rebel group began attacking government targets, claiming that the region was being neglected by Khartoum.         The rebels say the government is oppressing black Africans in favour of Arabs.         Historically, there has long been tension in Darfur over land and grazing rights between the mostly nomadic Arabs and farmers from the Fur, Massaleet and Zagawa ethnic groups.         There are two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (Jem), which have been linked to senior Sudanese opposition politician Hassan al-Turabi.

       Original Notice from Sibel, June 8, from  urlLink http://www.unansweredquestions.org/headlines.php  Unanswered Questions: Thinking for ourselves.  9/11 Whistleblower to be joined by Dan Ellsberg at Upcoming Hearing, June 14th  Your Support Is Needed June 14th, 9:30 AM -- U.S. District Court 3rd &amp; Constitution Ave (Constitution Ave. Entrance) [Please post and distributely widely] For over two years Attorney General John Ashcroft has been relentlessly engaged in covering up my reports and investigations into my allegations. He has asserted the rarely invoked State Secret Privilege in my court proceedings, and has used it to quash a subpoena request for my deposition from attorneys representing 9/11 family members on information regarding 9/11.  Ashcroft is not protecting 'national security' or 'state secrets' of the United States. On the contrary, he is endangering our national security by covering up facts and information related to criminal and terrorist activities against this country and it's citizens. Ashcroft is fully aware that making this information public will bring about the question of accountability, will expose serious criminal activities, and his complicity in covering up.  On Monday, June 14, 2004, at 10:00 AM, Judge Reggie Walton is expected to issue his ruling on the state secret privilege assertion by AG Ashcroft, which is intended to gag me. The hearing will be held in US District Court for the District of Columbia, located at 3rd and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, Judge Walton's courtroom. Please attend if you can, since by your presence both the court and Ashcroft will understand that this attempt to cover up will not go unnoticed.  I will be there, in front of the Court's Constitution Avenue entrance, at 9:30 AM, and will be joined by Daniel Ellsberg to make press statements and to meet with all of you.  DC Court with map  urlLink http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/location.html   Hope to see you there,  Sibel D. Edmonds  P.S. Look for 60 Minutes to do another segment on this case next Sunday.

        You see, they just want to watch football.  It just dawned on me while I was reading  urlLink Nabil's Blog , I don't know why I haven't thought of it much before. I suppose I never really put faces on the people in Iraq. Since the beginning of the war I've always looked at the situation as "Iraq" or the "war in Iraq", without associating the war with faces. I've always looked at it far too abstractly, which reminds me of a lesson in English class; war as an abstraction. It's not that I haven't thought about individual loss and suffering, more that I forgot about the simple things I take for granted, take sports as an example.     urlLink Nabil's blog Iraqi sports news and my daily diaries.    Check it out, kinda makes you think a little. I feel sorry for all the people of Iraq. They just want to go about their lives, watch the Iraqi Olympic team play soccer, have fun with friends and family and do the things we do everyday and take for granted, without having to worry about turning the street corner into a 10 round burst from an AK.  Maybe Nabil just wants to watch the Olympics at a sports bar without getting killed on the way there.  As much as I want the Americans to win, I'll be rooting for the Iraqis this year.  Hard to explain how I feel about this, it just kinda dawned on me.  -Nick

      I've found this soldier's blog while perusing the usual sites. The man is currently serving in Iraq and is updating the blog daily. If you really want to know what's up then you need to read it, or atleast skim through it. This website only bolsters what I have posted here about the mainstream entertainment outlets, I mean, "media", and this one particular entry in particular is evidence that the media can not accurately portray how it is really like in Iraq, or any war for that matter. The particular entry I speak of can be found  urlLink here.   Really, do yourself a favor and read his blog. I can't stress enough it's importance.  He is a farely good writer but that does not matter, what matters is that it is of substance, raw, unedited, pure, crisp, refreshing, real, no bullshit, captivating, just the real deal, the way I like it. What a complete and utter joy to read through.  I hope it makes you think twice about what our men and women do for this country. No matter how you feel about the war, whether pro or anti, you need to read this. His stories are simply awesome. I hope he will be able to put them in book form as I will sure as hell buy a copy, no make that several copies and distribute them to my family and friends.  So now you have a little something more than just what I think about the mainstream entertainment outlets, you have real evidence of their shortfalls and inabilities to accurately report on the situation. Don't just take what you see on the MEOs (mainstream entertainment outlets) with a grain of salt, take it with a dump truck load. That goes for the links I post here too.  I will post more links to soldiers blogs as I come by them. This blog will now be in my links section as well, to make it easy for you to hop from site to site. I can't think of anything better than reading my blog;) and then  urlLink this blog.   The link is here as well: http://cbftw.blogspot.com/  Please stop by and wish he and his comrades well.
