						    (...) Si yo pudiera entender que es lo que realmente pasa por tu ser, que facil seria para mi el adios. Pero no es asi, estar a tu lado es lo unico que le pido a Dios. No puedo asimilar, que no lo intentaremos, que no te dejaras amar. No se como hacer para no pensarte, no se como hacer para no extraniarte, porque constantemente te recuerdo, te imagino, no se como lograre hacer para olvidarte si ni siquiera se como hacer para dejar de amarte... Quisiera tener el poder, de hacerte aceptar o entender lo que realmente sientes en tu ser. Te amo, te extranio y cada noche que ha pasado, cerraba mis ojos y con mi imaginacion te he alcanzado. No pude entender porque si realmente me jugue el todo, aun asi sola me quede. Porque si todo mi amor te quiero dar no te dejas alcanzar. Pero es asi aunque el tiempo pase y separados vayamos a estar, nunca pero nunca te voy a olvidar.

Sell Girl Scout cookies. 6. On a long ride, sway side to side at the natural frequency of the elevator. 7. Shave. 8. Crack open your purse, and while peering inside ask:"Got enough air in there?" 9. Offer name tags to everyone getting on the elevator. Wear yours upside-down. 10. Stand silent and motionless in the corner, facing the wall,without getting off.   11. When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves. 12. Lean over to another passenger and whisper: "Noogie patrol coming!" 13. Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral. 14. One word: Flatulence! 15. On the highest floor, hold the door open and demand that it stay open until you hear the penny you dropped down the shaft go "plink" at the bottom. 16. Do Tai Chi exercises. 17. Stare, grinning, at another passenger for a while, and then announce: "I've got new socks on!" 18. When at least 8 people have boarded, moan from the back: "Oh, not now, damn motion sickness!" 19. Give religious tracts to each passenger. 20. Meow occasionally.   21. Bet the other passengers you can fit a quarter in your nose. 22. Frown and mutter "gotta go, gotta go" then sigh and say "oops!" 23. Show other passengers a wound and ask if it looks infected. 24. Sing "Mary had a little lamb" while continually pushing buttons. 25. Holler "Chutes away!" whenever the elevator descends. 26. Walk on with a cooler that says "human head" on the side. 27. Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce "You're one of THEM!" and move to the far corner of the elevator. 28. Burp, and then say "mmmm...tasty!" 29. Leave a box between the doors. 30. Ask each passenger getting on if you can push the button for them.   31. Wear a puppet on your hand and talk to other passengers "through" it. 32. Start a sing-along. 33.

Get on a crowded elevator on a reasonably high floor. Without saying a word, press every button, turn to the other passengers, and grin maniacally. Get off one floor below the the one you got on, then hurry and take the stairs down so you can meet the elevator on the next floor. When the door opens, flash the same grin and say, "You were talking about me...weren't you?"          &amp;

						      IF LIFE HAPPENS TO DELIVER A SITUATION THAT YOU CANNOT HANDLE, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE IT. KINDLY PUT IT IN THE "SFGTD" (SOMETHING  FOR GOD TO DO) BOX. IT WILL BE ADDRESSES IN MY TIME, NOT YOURS. DO NOT HOLD ON TO IT. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF STUCK IN TRAFFIC DON'T DESPAIR, THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD FOR WHOM DRIVING IS AN UNHEARD OF PRIVILEGE.         SHOULD YOU HAVE A BAD DAY AT WORK… THINK OF THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR YEARS.        SHOULD YOU DESPAIR OVER A RELATIONSHIP GONE BAD… THINK OF THE PERSON WHO HAS NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LOVE AND BE LOVED IN RETURN.  SHOULD YOU GRIEVE THE PASSING OF ANOTHER WEEKEND… THINK OF THE WOMAN IN DIRE STRAITS, WORKING TWELVE HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK TO FEED HER CHILDREN.       SHOULD YOUR CAR BREAK DOWN LEAVING YOU MILES AWAY FROM ASSISTANCE… THINK OF THE PARAPLEGIC WHO WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THAT WALK.       SHOULD YOU NOTICE A NEW GRAY HAIR IN THE MIRROR… THINK OF THE CANCER PATIENT IN CHEMO WHO WISHES SHE HAD HAIR TO EXAMINE.       SHOULD YOU FIND YOURSELF AT A LOSS AND WONDERING, " WHAT IS LIFE ALL ABOUT?" ASKING, "WHAT IS MY PURPOSE?"… BE THANKFUL. THERE ARE THOSE WHO DID NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY.       SHOULD YOU FIND YOURSELF THE VICTIM OF OTHER PEOPLE´S BITTERNESS, IGNORANCE, SMALLNESS OR INSECURITIES… REMEMBER… THING COULD BE WORSE… YOU COULD BE THEM.            TRISH
