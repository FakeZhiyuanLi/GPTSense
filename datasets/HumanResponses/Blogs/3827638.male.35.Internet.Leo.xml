      Yeliz Ay, one of the athletes that will represent Turkey at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, came in first yesterday in the 10 km walking event at the 14th Dublin Walking Grand Prix in Dublin, Ireland.    Yeliz Ay's time of 46m12.00s was enough for her to capture gold and reclaim the Turkish Record. She finished 8 minutes ahead of her closest competitor.   The Turkish walker also placed first in two other distances.

      The speech that US President George W. Bush, the most protected president in the world, made at Galatasaray University in Istanbul has reportedly contributed greatly to the security image and promotion of Turkey. In the background was the Ortakoy Mosque and the Bosphorous Bridge.  The Union of Tourism Agencies, Managers, and Enterprisers (TUROB) President, Timur Bayindir, said yesterday that the Bush speech sent the message that if Bush, the most protected president in the world, can make a speech calmly in such an open and beautiful place, then anyone can be safe in this country.   Bayindir emphasized that the fact that certain state heads came to Istanbul was highly beneficial for the promotion of Turkey on TV channels in those countries as they broadcasted views of Istanbul. He pointed out the importance of the Bosphorus view in the background. He said, "They were seen as positive images. To me, it was nice." He also said that by choosing a university for the speech showed the positive atmosphere in a country where the ones who oppose the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) consist mostly of youth.

      The December 14 election in Cyprus is a turning point, and our columnist Nevval Sevindi, has taken the island's pulse before the elections. From [President Rauf] Denktas to the opposition, from Greek Cypriots to Turkish Cypriots, from Turkish immigrants to illegal workers, she talked to all layers of Cyprus, and listened to their dreams and expectations about the elections and after the elections.People in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) are almost divided into two, so to speak. Those with the desire to integrate with Europe are on one side. These describe themselves as leftists. The youths and women are in this camp, and CTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat, leads this group. This camp claims Cypriot identity. The pro-Denktas supporters are on the other side. They carry the flag of being Anatolian Turks. These are intimidated by the fear that 'the Greeks will come, Turks will go.' The votes will be put into the ballot boxes with this anxiety and both camps are likely to have a close proportion of the votes. A contentiously close outcome is likely in the election. The ones with a clear decision this time are not sure how they will vote, while those who had always voted for Denktas are saying, they will vote for union parties this time, and vice versa. The concrete political structure has already cracked. The crack of a new change will be enlarged by the election. The demands for more democracy will force the solution.     Election race of hopes and fears     The Besparmak Mountains stretching with all its grandeur as if it is the past of Cyprus. Its five-finger summit, which culture's handprint is it? I wonder whether the moonlight, as if veiled with a white tulle, is the symbol of today's uncertainty? When the sun rises, everything gets clear and bluest of the blue sea's infinity strikes the shore, wave by wave. What we seek in the infinity is our lives. Cyprus wants its today. Neither the past nor the future, it is only settling the scores of today, coming closer to the elections. [That is] the today of the Cypriot people. Cyprus with its women, men, Turkish citizens, Cyprus-born children, Cypriots, old Greeks and fighters.     The Cypriot people, consisting of many different layers are in an interesting social structure. There are those who are hostile to the Turkish Republic citizens, nicknamed 'Karasakal' (black beard). The Greeks coming from the south never forget to ask, 'where are you from?' before having dinners or lunches and shopping.     On the other hand, the Cypriots are complaining about their diminishing culture, even more so, losing their dialects. However, those who came here 30 years ago from Anatolia feel as if they are Cypriots. Those brought here when they were 1-2 years old, have set their hearts on this island. They say they feel strange in their old villages. There are those who came to the island as illegal workers from Mersin, Hatay, and Adana, workers with no insurance and security. These have failed to build a state of belonging. Hearsay is different about those who have passed over to the Greek side and work there. According to Denktas they number 2,000, but 10,000, according to the others.     Turkish youths here for education are complaining about expensiveness and anti-social campuses. The ones who are civil servants, farmers, workers in the private sector or on the Greek side, youths leaving the island for good, all have a common point: Unhappiness.     You can Fall in Love, but You cannot Get Married     The solution and EU party flyers and posters are placed along side of the roads: "Hello to whoever feels like a Cypriot." Then I just remember a saying by Denktas: "The only thing Cypriot in Cyprus are its donkeys."     Cyprus Social Research and Training Consultancy Center head, Muharrem Faiz, whose establishment is known for its public opinion surveys, says, "If you describe everything in life as culture, then hierarchical relations are removed. From an elitist perspective, it appears as if there is nothing in common in Cyprus. Culture seems like something that is frozen up. Many common points are shared among Armenians, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. They used to be happy about same things, sad about the same things, and fall in love. With the 1960 Cyprus Constitution, Turkish-Greek marriages were prohibited. You could fall in love in private, but could not get married in public. Since experiences in private cannot be carried on to the public domains, such partnerships could not be institutionalized. We have even experienced language racism. There is a desire to say that there is no Cyprus dialect. Tolerance and knowing your limits are dominant in the Cypriot identity. The ultra-right, fascist structures cannot gain ground among us. Tolerance is the most important quality of Cyprus."     Of Mediterranean origin, Cypriots are hooked up with pleasures of life such as going out for dinners, drinking, having fun and other comforts. The morning coffee tradition still exists in Cyprus. Of course, serving coffee before tea is a gift of Ottoman life. Cypriots are very hospitable and they immediately would like to prepare a feast for the guests. Their congenial identities are like a mirror of our Anatolian culture.     Behind the election and political polarization of today, a deep cultural polarization resides, so to say. The pro-Denktas side emphasizes the Anatolian Turk identity. The opposition on the other hand stresses the Cypriot identity. Gallery Kultur's (Culture) owner, Remzi Yektaoglu, is trying to establish a connection between the two cultures by making book translations from Greek to Turkish. "There used to be 31 Cyprus brandy names, that was our national drink, now raki has replaced it. Lahmacun is now preferred to our traditional dish, peach kebab. Among the youths, cultural erosion emerges with the migration concept. My father, although he had no education, could speak Greek and English very fluently. Now, no one can speak Greek."     He shows a photo of the 1950s. People carrying Turkish and Greek flags gathered around the British governor. Authenticating a joint-water protest, this photo at the same time is an identity description. He tells about the book entitled, 'Ortak Vatan' (Common Homeland), by Plutis Servas, who was the Limasol mayor, as being the first book translated into Turkish. The striking chapter in the book is this:     "The London government due to pressure for pro-Enosis in Cyprus, had to call both communities for an Advisory Parliament meeting on a colonial constitution in 1947. The Turkish community, despite having four seats in the Legislative Council, and the other 18 belonging to the Greek community, that the Turkish leadership still had the intention of approving the constitution, even under this bothersome position, was an impressive move. However, the Greek leadership, under the influence of a pseudo passion for Enosis with Greece, stupidly rejected this. Hence, our common homeland entered a crazy nationalist competition race, that we have been facing for half century."     Being issued a passport is torture     Bureaucracy recognizes neither Turk nor Greek; both sides are tired. Helping Cypriots to forget a little about the deep divisions, with the opening of the borders, now a passport demand issue has been brought to the agenda by the Greek side. According to Greeks 40,000, and according to Turks 30,000, at the most, have applied. Everyone acts in the Turkish style of, 'he/she has it, then I must have it too. The Greeks enjoy this and make things difficult in every way possible. In a single office with a few personnel, they have made the issue an uphill task. The first step is to have a birth certificate. This has be to delivered within three weeks, at the very least. It costs 50 cents. The second step is an identification card and it is five Cyprus liras (about 15 million Turkish liras). They say, 'come 20-25 days later.' For the passport, it is possible to receive an appointment only after a month of the waiting period.     CTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat says, "There is a Cypriot identity and it has not degenerated." Then he talks about the dialect degeneration, the Greek language moving out of their lives, and the spread of Turkey's Turkish. Saying, 'the youths do not know Greek anymore,' Talat defending the British traffic system in Cyprus, and pushing aside the Turkish traffic instruction manual, is an example of the immense pressure. While the Greek Cypriot side lives on with the Cypriot culture, the Turkish side gets closer to Turkey, and what is understood is that the wishes and realities are all tangled up. Lahmacun is not an imposition, but as a matter of fact, a richness added to Cyprus life. Not having the notion of 'hot,' the Cypriots today like to have hot dishes. Festivals at pastures by Laz folks, people living in the Black Sea region of Turkey, add color within that context. Here, the complaint of those who depend on Turkey, is by the Turks of Turkey, not knowing anything about Cypriots, and experiencing no emotional attachment. For the Turks of Turkey to look down on them and say, 'you live like a king with our money,' bothers the Cypriots. And for them, the Turks of Turkey are the 'black beard,' here! One more prejudice for you! We could list the prejudices they say as follows: "We earn the money, but they live in prosperity with our money without doing anything. Cypriots are ignorant, peasant and lazy. The Turks of Turkey are peasant and ignorant. In the 1940s-1950s, Greek villages were prosperous, Turkish villages were in ruins." In those years in Cyprus, with no roads and cars, technology was limited only to the battery radio. Rising from bed and going to bed with the rooster's crowing, life was spent picking up olives and carobs. And the children were shepherds of the flocks. Today, those shepherds control the flocks, driving Suzuki jeeps. The days of the village person have gone, and every place has been turned into buildings lots. The electricity, roads and infrastructure have been completed. An enormous change in social, cultural and physical structure has been experienced. There are some who say, 'Cypriots presumably are a cultural part of Turkey, in fact, they have become part of Cyprus itself.' Those who believe that the Turks of Turkey are integrating with the Cypriot culture are a little bit right. The ones who came around 1974 have acquired an islander identity. They have been broken away from their Bitlis and Mus identities of Turkey. However, those of Turkish origin are the vote source of Denktas. The hope of the youths who describe themselves as 'Cypriots,' is to be a European Union (EU) citizen. The election will be an indicator at the focal point of various layers and decompositions.     Even religious holidays in Cyprus a cause for polarization     Between the North and South, there is an incredible spite and superiority competition, whereas both sides are fed up with heavy-handed bureaucracy. "The Greek Cypriots are number one in business, but they also act peevishly on purpose. The world has changed a hundred times, but we are still immersed in old quarrels," says our Cypriot driver. Many inflictions are on to those, who want to cross into the North, to have a passport, to go South. Even more so, to make a phone call is tantamount to torture. I could not make a call to a friend of mine in South Cyprus. Theoretically, it is necessary to have a connection through the United Nations (UN) operator, but no one ever seems to succeed in doing this. It is possible to do that via Turkey by paying twice or three times more. I did that too, requested a friend in Turkey, who sent my friend in the South an e-mail, and made my friend call me from the South. The Greek Cypriot side can make calls easily. Unbelievable, but it is true!     Even religious holidays are a reason for polarization on both sides. Just recently, for the Greek Easter Day, the Greek Cypriots decorated the South for days in a show of spite. During the 20th anniversary celebrations, the Turkish side made incredible decorations, and by burning a giant Cypriot flag, spited all. A young Turkish Cypriot girl said: "The gigantic flag in this mountain had been consuming plenty of electricity. Let it be. If I were a Greek, I would have died of jealousy. Now, they must be dying." This is such an extreme attitude and behavior that makes the obnoxious Greek Cypriots see the Turks as outcasts. The Greek Cypriots have been saying, 'Join us, so that we hire you instead of the Philippine workers.'      Opposition Slogan: EU and Wealth   From November 18, a propaganda campaign got under way in Cyprus with immense political polarization. Looking at the headlines of Turkish-Cypriot newspapers, a serious polarization can be observed.   The Ortam newspaper ran a headline using a remark by Mustafa Akinci: "North Cyprus does not only consist of territory."   The Yurtsever Cyprus newspaper: "The pro-status quo starts preparing for a revolution upon understanding it would lose the elections. A sly plan against public desire!"   Everyone emphasizes renewal, change, better life and the Europe dream of the society. The Peace and Democracy Movement uses the slogan, "With your pride and self-esteem, Europe in the spring." With the debates on fraud escalating, Mustafa Akinci on presenting a report on the issue to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has ignited a new debate. While Turkey regards Cyprus as a national case, some say that they are fighting for their lives. I am entering the Peace and Democracy Party building. Partisans have come together around a table and are reading their gazettes, while at the same time working. The Social Salvation Party, as a former body, carried its members to this movement.   I am talking with Mustafa Akinci, from whose window tangerines and French apples appear: "This election is a kind of referendum. It is will determine a destiny for Cyprus. This is an election that will affect Turkey's relations with Greece and the European Union. The masses want the EU for a better life. Our life has been neither that of a bird nor a camel. Is this place a province of the Turkish Republic (TR), or is it independent? Turkey even cannot do many things with us. For instance, we cannot play a soccer match together. Turkey cannot sign a Customs Union Agreement with us; however, it would have to sign the treaty if Greek side becomes an EU member.   They will sell goods with zero tariffs and we will look from the outside. The Annan plan is in the middle of the maximalist intentions of both sides. When our laws and language were valid in our schools, the Greeks would come and would assist, what happened? Both sides have to give up intimidation, anyhow. The operation in 1974 has been placed in the hearts of all Turkish Cypriots, but the rest has not come. After the end of Cold War era, when the Greek took steps forward on the road to Europe, we stood still. Turkey would be regarded as using us as pawns, if it does not contribute to our joining the EU. You could not prevent the Greeks, why should you prevent the Turks? Nobody should deceive anybody; let us build a loving and respectful relation. Let us put the mother-babe literature in another place. We want to be accepted as adults. Turkey has to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria."   I was in the same plane with Republican Turkish Party and Cooperated Powers (CTP-BG) Chairman Mehmet Ali Talat, Peace and Democracy Movement (BDH) leader Mustafa Akinci and the Solution and EU Party (CABP) Chairman Ali Erel. They said they started the propaganda from Strasburg, where they were invited to a European Parliament (EP) meeting, because they are faithful to their pledges on the EU. They indicated that they would like the EP to give Turkey a negotiation date and to give a signal about that, right now.   Erel at the same time is a businessman. He explains that 100 civil society institutions have come together under the presidency of the Cyprus Turkish Chamber of Commerce (ISAD), and have presented their views for a solution and a common EU intention. Staging four big demonstrations, and in spite of the fact that the latest participation was over 80,000, everything was peaceful; self-confidence has benefited from the demonstrations. Nobody had expected the demonstrations would be that peaceful.   Reaction Against Being 'Single man'   The doors that had not been opened for years, have opened due to this pressure. There had mainly been fear in both communities. Self-confidence in the people has developed since April 23. No violence has occurred between the two sides, not a single incident has been experienced. That Denktas kept on saying, 'if the Greeks come, they will butcher us,' and the Greeks being scared of the Turkish army, made people feel hopeless. By keeping '74 alive, fear has always been fabricated.   For years, the left votes have constantly been 30 percent and that of the right 70 percent. Previously, the opposition was only the left. Now our party is not leftist. CTP defines itself as Marxist-Leninist. The separation into left and right is meaningless for us. Government-opposition relations and comparisons do exist. There is no theoretical difference. The Communist Party (AKEL) in the South has influenced the left in the North very much. A center party cannot be formed, somehow. This is being a 'single man.' We consider replacing the 'single man' with a team.'"   Erel adds that most of the youths are unemployed and have been filling the cafés. The youths leave the country. As a result of unemployment, the retailers also shut down their stores and go to work on the Greek side. The construction workers too are not happy. Emphasizing the issue, Erel says, "Attempts to earn money, to see the discourse of the fanatical nationalists in the South, pass by their posters and take orders from them, make people unhappy. This is a serious social problem." His daughter, educated in England, is a civil engineer. His daughter is the only one who returned to her country, among the Cyprus youths at the university. His son, educated in England as well, graduated in electrical-electronic engineering at Manchester University. He says, "after Turkey, we all feel ourselves culturally close to England."   CTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat is a Middle East Technical University (METU) graduate. The party building, an old Greek house, is at the center of Lefkose (Nicosia). The 'Yes to Europe' slogan is everywhere. He also finds this election very different from the others. He evaluates the situation as coming to the surface because of the EU process pressure, and as an election that will determine the fate of Turkey. Talat, complaining up till now about the passive behavior of Turkey, thinks that Denktas has prevented Turkey from speaking positively, by displaying the Annan Plan as a death sentence.   Talat says the following: "They have always said that CTP does not want Turkey, it is pro-Greek. However, now the interest of the Turks from Turkey has increased in us. The CTP United Powers embraces all. We are saying that the social government tradition is important. Being pro-EU means being pro-democracy. It means limitless democracy. Businessmen were against the Solution and EU [Party]. The situation changed following the Annan Plan. There are many argumentative things in the Annan Plan. We definitely should sit around the table. If Denktas stays out of the picture, the real picture would certainly emerge. And this will expose that the ones against reconciliation are the Greek Cypriots.   Stressing that they will lose youths, that many people without social security work on the Greek side and that means unhappiness, Talat expresses the leftist view as follows: "Making the human being the foundation, making him/her happy, egalitarian, and modern with income equality."   Remzi Yektaoglu, the leader of the Patroitic Union Party (YBP), that opposes the ruling power the most, and is not taking part in the election, saying that they are the only party filing a lawsuit due to the voter registers, notes: "People who speak Turkish live in the north of Cyprus and people who speak Greek in the South. The opposition has never changed here. No result can be obtained without replacing Denktas. Turkey should change. I mean the 'hawks.' You can find many articles of the Annan Plan in the 'Memoirs' of Denktas. Even if Mumtaz Soysal prepares a plan and puts it before Denktas, he says, 'no' again. Cypriots have been living on a looted economy, without producing anything, for many long years. War cannot abolish the right to property.   Candles of Andreas in bottom of Cyprus   The Besparmak Mountains are in our right, and I am going to Dip Karpas, from an old road passing in front of Catalkoy. This old road, called mountain road, is parallel to the sea and has very beautiful scenery. The most esteemed public beaches are here. Olive groves sprawl between the sea and us. The power plant at the side of the road is the Turkish side's energy source. We reach the furthermost part, Bogaz and Dip Karpas, the foreland of Cyprus after Yenierenkoy.   At this rocky point, named Victory Head, the renowned Apostolos Andreas Monastery rises. The Turkish government made the monastery and accommodation, into one surrounding room. After 1974, the Greeks converted mosques into churches and Turkish people converted churches into mosques. Small, white mosques are beautiful examples of our old tradition.   Despite costing serious money, the Greeks rushed to monastery following the opening of the border gates. The Greeks coming on Saturdays brought tons of candles when the gates were opened for the first time. From this point, the silhouette in Syria appears. While I am going to Dip Karpas, 200 kilometers from Girne, I pass through the most esteemed Bafra beaches. This 1.5-kilometer beach is known as the cleanest sea in the world. Yenierenkoy is an old Greek village. It was famous for its tobacco and had a factory. Today none of them exist. The residents of Karpat are usually British. It is said that these places become enlivened in summers.   Dip Karpas is like a laboratory. Laz, Kurdish, and Greeks in a limited number, live here. I enter a Greek coffee house. Ms. Kryagu of Karpaz, and her husband Niko Sampri, run this place. Their assistant is Cevdet Dag. He even translates for us. The former owner of the coffee house, Ahili, had moved to the Greek side. Costumers of the coffee house have increased with the opening of the gates. Ms. Kryagu married for 29 years, says this is her second marriage. She has two daughters. They are also married on the Greek side. Saying both sides have prohibitions in terms of passport and identity, Kryagu asks: "All of us want unity. It is better if we return to our domains but where will they dwell if our people come?"   They are bound to this culture and land   Cevdet Dag came from Mus with his family when he was 3-4 years old. In the region, where 7,500 Greeks lived when they first came, only Turkish people live here now. There are only 220 Greek residents now. He said: "I used to speak Kurdish when I was a little child. I have four children now. None of them know Kurdish. We used to play with Greek children when we were kids. We always used to come together. We used to organize matches. There is only one Greek school now." Dag tells of stockbreeding as 'being dead' after the opening of the gates. He says very cheap meat comes from the other side, anyway. The Turks of Turkey origin cannot pass to Greek side. Only Turkish Cypriots are allowed and the Greek side tries to prevent their people from shopping here. Dag supports Mehmet Ali Talat's CTP in the elections. He says: "My father supported Denktas for 30 years. I did not leave his way. This year's elections are different. I will support Talat so that we can learn whether or not we will go or stay. I am not happy. I always have a feeling I will go. But I cannot live in Turkey if I go now. I cannot stay two weeks in Mus. I return back immediately." His words epitomize Turkish people also being bound to this land and culture.   While entering the monastery, an old mother of a Greek family holds a big candle. They light the candles and kiss the pictures of Apostolos Andreas and other saints as they enter. They fulfill their wishes and vows.   In fact, this monastery is a place where Turkish people also light candles and offer vows. Ayazma and the fountain where holy water flows, are places to visit. Firat, selling plastic drums, for holy water is 15 years old. Firat, whose mother is from Adana, and father from Mus, says: "I am from Cyprus. He is learning Greek from his Greek friends, and speaks with people taking water from Ayazma. He tells the history of the monastery in Greek. The people of Karpas, who have set up a bazaar here, are immigrants from Turkey. Mehmet Sadikbaglar came from Kars when he was one year old. His spent his childhood with Greek children. He says: "We have a Greek neighbor. He leaves the keys with us when he goes to the South. We get along very well." Mehmet, 30, speaks Greek very well and sells snails. A kilogram of snail is one Cyprus lira. It is necessary to brine the snails and leave them in a basket one day.   Speaking six languages, Mehmet Barlas is an immigrant from Kars. He says very sadly: "I cannot turn back. I am from Cyprus. I have lived here for 30 years. We always win in war and lose on the table." He had lived in London for two years in 1990. He returned to Cyprus due to motherland nostalgia because the British consider Turks as second class. He ends his words by saying: "Cyprus is my motherland. I don't know that place. England is also foreign land." Everyone's fear is that of being ejected from this country. He is a feverish Denktas supporter

      The Chilean government, celebrating 2004 as the year of Pablo Neruda, announced that Turkey's Hilmi Yavuz would receive the Chilean Presidential Medal of Honor because of his contributions to the popularity of Neruda.    Yavuz was selected from among 100 respected authors around the world to receive the award. "The Chilean government wishes to bestow the award not only to the authors with detailed information on the works of Neruda, but also to distinguished personalities such as yourself in the cultural circles," reads a letter sent to Yavuz by Pedro Barros, the Chilean Ambassador to Turkey.   The President of Chile, Ricardo Lagos, adds, "The Presidential Medal of Honor is thought fit to award to you due to your help to introduce the works of Neruda via translations into Turkish."   Yavuz, who translated many of Neruda's poems, expressed his great pleasure with the award. Yavuz will receive the award at a 'Neruda Night" celebration later this year.

       The World Bank's Turkey Director, Andrew Vorkink, said yesterday, "Growth in Turkey is not artificial, but healthy" after evaluating the 12.4 percent growth rate in the first quarter of the year.  As Vorkink was leaving the "First Banking Arena" at the Ankara Sheraton Hotel, he spoke to journalists about the growth. The 12.4 percent growth is the result of stability in the economy, Vorkink said, but the banking sector needs to be more active.   When asked if growth creates a threat to consumption, Vorkink said that growth was healthy, and that consumption and production increased. When asked whether the growth was 'hormoned,' so to speak, he said: "the growth is not hormoned. This is a healthy growth, because it is not an imposed growth, but rather the result of economic production actors."
