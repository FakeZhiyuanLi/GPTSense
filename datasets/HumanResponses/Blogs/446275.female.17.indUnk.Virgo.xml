      I just don't understand how all of these minorities - blacks, immigrants, women - got the right to vote.  Now, despite how despicable they may be, blacks and immigrants are a topic for another time, right now: women.  Women just don't really need to vote.  Everybody knows that all that they do [or should do, at least] all day is sit around the house and take care of the children while cooking and watching soap operas.  They aren't informed of political issues, they don't know what is going on in the world.  And, by golly, they should not be.  Just think, if these females started watching the news they would stop taking care of our nation, Under God's children.  In addition to this, every single time the woman has sexual relations [because, you see, the average woman is a whore.  Every good Christian knows that one should only have sex for procreation and one should never  enjoy  it.  That's against God's way.] it's equivalent to her selling her vote.  Because everybody knows that women don't really think, they just latch on to others' opinions.  So if this hypothetical woman was having sexual intercourse with a man out of wedlock [obviously they are Liberals because only Liberals have premarital sex.  this is another instance that the death penalty would come in handy] and he whispered in her ear, "Oh woman with whom I am fornicating, won't you please vote for that Liberal candidate John Kerry?" she would do it.  This is not the way to a good democratic system.  In another growing trend, women are getting entirely too uppity lately.  Now they want to kill their babies and get upset when the Good Christians of our nation tell them that this is unacceptable behaviour.  As one of my fellow authors pointed our ina previous post, life - as well as the soul - is formed at conception and if is the worst sin  ever  to take a human life.  These baby killer, anti-life Liberals are just the source of all evil in the world.  Masturbation is also, as a commenter pointed out, "evil and unnatural".  When people masturbate it is exactly like killing children.  And everybody knows why the Liberals want to kill children.  Because they are afraid that the children will grow up to be good law-abiding Republican Christians in our United States Under God Our Holy Master of America.  Just another string of examples of why Liberals are the Agents of Lucifer, the Devil and Enemy of our Lord.

      [this is a special guest submission by our dear friend Justin, who is obviously brilliant just like me.]  On May 22, the World Health Organization succumbed to the mass liberal Jewish gay conspiracy and raised the threat level of God's smite upon the gays, AIDs, to a higher level. Although they have not officially been inducted into the Axis of Evil, it seems to only be a matter of time.  Showing once again their uncanny ability to buckle under even the slightest of pressure, WHO shows yet another step in the increasingly slippery slope of liberalism infecting us in America today. Citing work by Dr Lee Jong-wook, a suspected Arab sympathizer, the liberal-leaning "international" organization sought to overcome the "stigma" and "discrimination" of having HIV or AIDs.  This is where I must disagree. AIDs is God's punishment upon homosexuals, and any stigma it incurs is well deserved. After all, in a recently conducted study, over 90% of America's favored a heterosexual president over a homosexual president. Disturbing God's natural order would be like sticking a very personal part of your body into a beehive - of course, I wouldn't put it past liberal's like Bill Clinton!  Officials from WHO also spoke about the need to "prevent and treat HIV/AID." Well, yeah, if by "prevent" you mean "stop engaging in homosexual sex" and by "treat" you mean "hellfire and damnation." You say your average American doesn't know this? Well I'll be darned, and the public school system was doing so well!  Sorry to bore all of you that pay attention to Fox News with this - I know you already know.

      Another thing that is terribly wrong with Liberals:  they allow websites like  urlLink Erowid.org  to exist.  As we all know, marijuana is the scourge of the devil.  It steals young children from their religious beliefs and leads them down the path of drug abuse and whatnot.  They start smoking the marijuana and they enter the forbidden dark gateway of  harder drugs .  They start stealing and they can only have fun by messing up their brain functions.    Is this what you want for the future of our population?  A bunch of doped up zombies wandering around looking for their next fix?  I believe in the deaht penalty and I believe in it for drug users.  Their type should not be welcome in our United States Under Our Lord Jesus Of America.

      I come back here to make another go at freeing people from their terrible liberal views and, what do I see but a comment claiming that gay people cannot get married.  Well, my friend, there you are incorrect.  As  urlLink Orson Scott Card said , homosexuals certainly can get married, they just must find a member of the opposite sex willing to marry them.  It's as easy as that.    Also, the 1st and 14th amendments may protect you but not if you're breaking the law.  Unless you are in one of the states where  urlLink engaging in homosexual behaviour  is legal, you really have no protection there.  The profile of the commenter claims that he is moving to Kansas in July, if this really is the case, I'd liek to declare that  I  am from Kansas and I know for a fact that being homosexual is illegal in our great and noble state.    I can also see that the Liberals are not only scumbags but also wimps.  They hide behind their 'anonymous' name in the comments of our great weblog thus showing that they cannot really stand up and declare their true opinions without attempting to disguise themselves.  If your views were worthwhile you would not state them anonymously.

      As any good Christian knows, cloning is evil because clones do not have souls. Only people born naturally have souls, and they get these souls at the moment of conception when they become real people just like you and me. (unless you are a democrat, they don't have souls)   Now, those of you who know anything about me know that I think trying to save endangered species or protect the environment is a very bad idea. It would cost good, Christian, corporations a lot of money, and if God wanted all the animals to live he wouldn't have made them so delicious, or their habitats so fun to destroy.  Now you are probably wondering, what do these two evils, cloning and the environment, have to do with each other? Well, I'll show you. Some crazy liberals have combined the two to commit the most heinous of sins,  urlLink cloning pandas !!  I find this appalling, naturally. It's unnaturaly and against the will of God! First of all, Pandas are Chinese and therefor they are communist Athiest bears! They are not worthy of saving!  And even if they were saving Glorious Bald Eagles, that would not justify trying to play god with their evil, secular, science!

      A previous comment rather rudely pointed out to me that America not following the Geneva Convention "makes us look like bullies to the rest of the world."  My question to you, my conservative friends and liberal enemies, is, why shouldn't America be a bully?  Everybody knows that all of those little worthless third-world countries such as Zimbabwe, France, Iraq, Afganistan, and England would not get by if not for us!  Who do they export their goods to?  Who gives them aid when thye need it?  Who pays for them when they cannot pick up a resteraunt bill?  Yes.  That is all the Holy United Conservative States of America.  If you are not with us, you are against us.  That is the way it's been since this great country was started and this is the way it shall always be.   Also, of course Bush is a War Hero.  He is sending Americans to Fight in Iraq because he is too busy leading the country.  If he was not leading the country, our great and noble America, then all really would be lost.  We could not survive if we did not have him for president.  This is why he, himself, cannot go and fight.  He is too patriotic to do that.  Another thing about the liberals that I absolutely hate.  Waht is it with their insistence that "under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Alliegience? I mean, if the founders of this country had not wnted it there, thy would nt ohave put it there.  What next?  Take our holy Lord, Saviour of Mankind, and Holy Father, our God off of money?  Out of God Bless America?  What will these liberals want?  We already know that if we give them an inch they'll next want a country.  Those liberal scumbags.  They should have been the fisrt to be put in the concentration camps.

      If those hippy liberals have their way, gays won't just be invading our homes on "Will and Grace", but they'll be invading the holy sanctity of marriage!   urlLink Sign the petition  and  urlLink buy a t-shirt  to show those sodomites what we think!

      I was reading a printed version of Fox News the other day and I heard of terrible atrocities being commited in our great nation.  By liberals.    The gays are marrying each other in Massachusetts; Kansas, the one state that anybodyin the old days could rely on for good, old-fashined conservative behaviour, voted AGAINST an amendment banning gay marriage, and all of the United States is in shambles.  Because of the liberals.  That John Kerry character is trying to defeat our Great Lord and War Hero, George W. Bush.  If that isn't the darndest thing then I just don't know what is.  George W. Bush stood up to those damn Iraqi terrorists that caused Septemeber 11th (along with the homosexuals, of course) and those Islamics deserve waht they got from our noble American forces in the Middle-East. They got nothing more or less than what they deserved.  Let's not forget that they brutally chopped off the head of one of our Americans AND bombded our World Trade Center.  Everbody who is anybody knows that this Kerry monster is a fraud, anyway.  He THREW his medals at the WHITE HOUSE to protest the VIETNAM WAR.  But, you know, he was greedy and didn't really throw the medals that he'd earned (earned by lying and cheating, that is.  unlike our George W. Bush who wanted the war in Viet-Nam) he threw copies of the medals or just the ribbons.  Waht a fraud.  He makes me sick.  That Kerry bastard.    Wow, I was listening to the radio today and some of that music should really be banned.  It's just profane.  I dont see how anybody can be allowed to listen to it.  All of their euphamisms for the private parts of males and females just makes me uncomfortable.  Plus, all of that Satanic music (rock, rap, metal) really is quite offensive.  Next teenagers will stop going to church like I do every three days.    Then our country will really go downhill.  Love forever, Anastasia (me@ithinkso.org)
