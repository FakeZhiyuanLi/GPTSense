      I kind of lost my shit at the Banana Republic today, much to the horror of the perfectly manicured and gum-smacking manager. Not that I was not completley justified mind you. I basically wasted three bucks on metro fare (okay it was actually government subsidized transit fare) and an hour of my life to get a product that was allegedly on hold for me at the store. The item was actually on hold, but it was the incorrect item.  I made my irritation sufficiently known, and I suppose the matter deserves no more thought.

      So everyone's bitching about the price of gas. First of all, these people should keep in mind the fact that we pay half of what the Europeans pay for gas (which might explain their cute little fuel-efficient cars as opposed to the monstrosities Americans drive). And second of all they should realize that it is their choice to drive.   Yes, choice. If more people chose not to drive then public transportation would be forced to improve and it wouldn't just be the poor, the mentally incompetant and me on the bus...okay I'm not going to lie, I mostly take the train anyways, but the larger point remains. High gas will hopefully push the masses (especially the hidden reserves of hot men) on public transportation. Not to mention that less car action and more walking might unburden our nation of fatasses of some excess poundage.   Speaking of pork & bloating, Iraq. This country is hemorrhaging money to destroy and not to uplift. People that are planning on voting for old squinty eyes should think of that the next time they gas up their Ford Expolorer. Or their hummers. We are bleeding money for no apparent reason. We are our own worst WMD.   I would like to see George Bush's God tell him to have the government create a hybrid hummer.

      So I go to the Y. Before the Y was the gym in my building at work on D St.   Look I don't love the gym either people, but if I feel the need to psych myself up for cardio I do it in my head where that kind of annoying pep belongs. Why, oh Why Vengeful God of the Christian Coalition must I listen to people at the gym rev themselves up? Today there was a man on a treadmill (looked perfectly normal and in excellent shape) that felt the need to talk himself into a frenzy- BUDDY, here is an idea- concentrate on your running and shut the f*&k up and you will have more energy to run and look even better! Okay, that was actually not so awful (because nothing will ever be more horrendous than sex-noise-at-the-gym-man who I will shortly recall from the scary memory holding cell of my brain), what was absolutely wrong in every sense was that this man who was talking to himself was hacking phlegmers up as well. Not just hacking up phlegm, but hacking it up into the YMCA towels which will be washed and put out for general use. He was also blowing his nose into the very same towel. ASSHOLE- buy a hankercheif if you feel the need to cough your nasty shit up on shared equipment in the middle of the Y in the gayborhood. Nobody wants communal towels defiled by your bodily fluids. And yes, I know they wash them, but will any amount of scalding hot water ever erase that nasty memory of Phlegm Dude hacking his insides up. Methinks not.  Okay, to the memory chambers batman. Sex Noise Man...oh Sex Noise Man, you disgusting old man. It was a work gym, and he made moaning noises and breathing noises and comments that everyone agreed closely approximated how an old man would sound if he was fornicating as if he would never again fornicate. Oh vile old man, you wrecked what tiny shred of enthusiasm I had for going to the gym by giving me an univited and  scary look into the abyss of elderly sex. 2 years I listened to you, and come 8 am tomorrow I am fairly confident that somewhere on D Street someone will be forced to listen to you yell "Ummmmmmmmm, come on baby, ohhhhh, ohhhh, ohhh" while you ride the elliptical machine in a frenzied state of cardiovascular overcompensation that will most likely be your eventual downfall.   My most special memory of Sex Noise Man though is definitely the one from the one year anniversary of Sept 11, when a few of us found ourselves in the gym during the memorial services at the WTC site. The gym rats had turned the audio on on the TVs and we were all halfheartedly working out, but mostly listening. And then, then the moment of silence, and while the rest of us slowed down on the treadmill to walking speed, or just sort of stopped on the recumbent bike, there was suddenly- during the moment of silence- the noise of elderly sex as Sex Noise Man went at it on the stair-stepper. "Gonnaaaaaahhhhhh Make It, oh Goddddddddddddd" Certainly one man's life-affirming tribute to the dead.

      The answer to the above question is most likely no. Today I was all the way to K Street (where I stopped in utter fascination to watch a bird make a snack out of a very alive and stupidly vibrating cicada) when some man rolled up next to me and said something unclear but decidedly profane. I try to limit my exposure to strangers yelling & cursing at me to my morning and afternoon forays into Franklin Park (with the mornings belonging to the unhinged and the afternoons owned by the bike messengers, but really some days it is a thin line between the two).   You know how bums have the awful habit of shaking their cups at you to silently yet still gratingly ask for money? Well, I have seen cups and I have seen hats with the central idea behind the concept being some sort of hand-held repository of coins, and if you are really lucky paper...well I was walking through the gayborhood the other day when some homeless man started shaking his f*&ing visor at me! A visor! Was he trying to be funny, because seriously if he was it was hysterical, but if he was truly earnest it was the saddest thing I have seen since the Swan Pageant on Fox last night.

      I do not watch the local news often, in fact I would rather give birth to a large desert cactus than be forced to listen to the over the top banter and the excruciatingly desperate need to form clever segues between sections. PEOPLE OF THE NEWS, HEAR ME- It sounds no more natural than listening to George Bush attempt to ruminate about complex foreign issues. The segue has become a rediculous excercise that pushes the limits of your state education and any modicum of patience I might have after listening to that enthralling report about the city council meeting.   And, hey weather guy-  Short sleeves or long sleeves? Umbrella or no umbrella? When did meteorologists decide that I had any sort of interest in their "digital doppler" machine or their technique? Five minutes listening to this person showing me the color spectrum superimposed on a map of the greater tri-state area and all I want to know is if I need my f*&ing umbrella?   So speaking of umbrellas and bad segues, when did the American news become so unbearable? I nearly stopped donating to NPR when Bob Edwards was thrown off the air, that is until I remembered that I have never actually donated. Bob Edwards was a voice of calm, much the same as the BBC is. There was no wildly inflected phrases and the influence of Billy Bush, MTV and Fox news had not crept into that bastion of American calm. "There was a fire in Southern CA" Bob Edwards tells me...or I turn to a different program and hear about "the WALL of red-hot fire that LEAPS out at the reporter, and by the way stay tuned for the report where I interview that DARLING little girl whose cute little stuffed animal was INCINERATED in the massive FIRESTORM".   yes, incinerated. Speaking of NPR, can someone please tell WAL-MART that their ads sound rediculous on NPR...I mean beyond rediculous. I heard an ad being read for WAL-MART today right after the good people of Morning Edition aired a blistering story about their abysmal labor record.   Question of the day, what is more asinine: WAL-MART advertising on NPR or people who continue to back George Bush's presidency?
