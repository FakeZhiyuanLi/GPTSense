      I’ve dropped off the arm’s length grid for the past few days.  If I wasn’t within arms reach of you, you weren’t going to find me.  I think a great deal of it has to do with not wanting to deal with N, for her story has continued to degrade.  I’ve made my stand in typical Brad fashion, I stopped talking to her.  Not that I truly disappeared, more that I stopped putting forth any effort.  I haven’t been around all that much, spending a great deal of time out either running errands or punishing my body with alcohol, but a great many hours have been spent with the two of us on each other’s buddy list, both there, both active, neither IMing the other, and it kills me that I’ve turned in Mikey from Swingers.  I’ve tried to fill my time with other things, downloading music, watching movies, I’ve stocked my fridge and my bar, I even bought some new clothes and saw two of my newest favorite performers (Death Cab For Cutie and Ben Kweller) in concert.  With one or two exceptions, I’ve confined my entire existence to Central Texas.  And yet, with my world that much smaller, that much more packed (odd how that works), I haven’t felt the completion that the day to day is supposed to bring.  I haven’t felt overly happy on any sort of a grand scale, the minor highs haven’t been enough to even out the sweeping, transcending low that I’ve fallen into.  I’ve been matching the stock market, if you want to look at it that way.   And yet, Fate strikes again.  As I shift screens, a soon-to-be metaphor for life, I notice that N is both online and active.  Online, active, and not talking to me.  I don’t think I’m that high maintenance, just a quick note, two lines.  Hey, how’ve you been?  Haven’t talked to you for a while.  I’m not even looking for correct grammar, just a sign, a pulse, a glimmer if not of hope than of life.  Fighting without words, violence without action.  It’s all the violence of no action that kills me in life.  I can deal with bullets, I can deal with death I can see, but the death that I can’t do anything about, can’t see coming, can’t fight against, can’t rage against the coming of, that’s what gets me, that’s what bothers me.   The whole thing gives me reason to run, back to the fantasy that is beautiful women I’ve never met.  I can’t help it, I’d rather have a nice, easy, completely one-sided relationship with a celebrity that has not the slightest notion of my existence than suffer a bad relationship with reality.  It’s all along the lines of High Fidelity, where I want the fantasy, the honey-moon period, perhaps that’s why the vast majority of my relationships, extenuating circumstances aside, crumple and die after three or four months.  I’ve even found my taste in celebrities has shifted, the women to those I’d like to date, as opposed to the purest of teenage lust with ones I just wanted to screw.  Granted, there are still the professional artists who’s work I enjoy because I respect it, but there are a few who I like more because of the artist than the art.  With them, the relationship is written in my head, with N, with K, with any of the other letter-coded women who’s realities were all to real, once the fantasy wore off, usually so did the relationship.  Perhaps relationships are better left to my head, to my writing, to that which however real, really doesn’t exist.  Or maybe I’m just not that good with people.  Perhaps pop culture has instilled me with severely damaged expectations as to what to expect in a relationship.

      So, it's been a few minutes, not much, but, I feel like I'm missing out on some greater cause.  Is it so wrong to have a blog with the sole purpose of understanding myself?  I mean, really, even if I don't get any closer to finding out who I am, what if someone reading this does?  Isn't that worth it?  Is anyone else reading this?  -PBR

      I'm swinging this one freestyle, not typing it in Word and then cutting and pasting, which means that anyone reading this has to deal with drunken typos due to too much absinthe and too much emotoin jammed onto one ash-laden keyboard.   Yesterday was a day that was both better and worse than I had expected.  It started out better, with the 4th ID Welcome Home celebration, which had a host of great entertainers, and $1 16oz beers.  I ran into a lot of people that I knew and there was a great deal of drinking and dancing and the small catastrophie that is losing a cell phone.  I lost it sometime during Skynard playing, not that I'm the biggest Skynard fan, but I did listen to a lot of Skynard during my years of change that made up the past decade or so.  It was probably one of the worst non-lethal ways to kill a buzz, and had me leave the celebration, cancel my old phone, calling a cab to go and get a new phone (as everyone I knew was just too drunk to drive).  The good thing is that I got a phone that was better than I had before (keeping with my 'Keeping Up With the Jones' techno-lifestyle) and picking up a CD and 2 DVDs that I'd been scouring through the Texan Cultural Wasteland for (you'd be surprised how hard you have to look for a Men's Store here, Manhattan, why have I forsaken you?!).  So, I came home in a better mood. Friday started early, with a knock on the door at barely nine in the morning by Sammy, my battle buddy from Iraq, and then a noon trip to find food, a trip to get sewing done on uniforms to be worn on Monday, a trip to pick another buddy's goods up from Storage, then a movie, and then dinner at a bar and grill (more of an emphasis on bar, less on grill), before returning to find a disturbing bit of information not given, but gathered from N. I've pointed out in my novel, A Life Sentence, that the imagination is both the best friend and worst enemy of a writer.  It might be the lifesource, but it is also the life-ender, a double-edged blade as easily turned on the owner as used by him.  And of course, it's the cause of jealousy, rage, and anger.  N had been away for hours, with only an angelic emoticon as an away message.  Then she returned for less than a minute, just long enough to change her away message to say that she'd gone to bed as the happiest girl in the world.  So what does this mean?  Does this mean that relationships have diminished to the empathetic understanding of emoticons, a world where we no longer use words, let alone body language or subtext to mean what we're not saying?  Are we now living in a world where people must jump to conclusions based on images?  Or does it mean what you and I are both thinking, that N is seeing someone more convientent, have I gone the way of the dinosaur, since I'm convient, if not convienent enough, now that I have no inherent danger in my life?   Yeah, I feel like hell.  I really do.  As soon as I saw the second away message, the one proclaiming her happiness, the happiness caused by someone other than me, I jumped to conclusions, immediately assumed that there was another guy, one who had an easier, if not better, access to her emotions, and took to drink, took to absinthe and Marlboros, took to writing a character I haven't written in years, haven't thought about writing, considered myself better than, or dead, or beyond, in years, and I wrote him into a bad siuation, where a manifestation of death was coming for him, there to claim revenge for all that he's lived through, there to threaten his wife, his son, his life, despite him having moved on.  Why?  Is it a masochistiic manuever to induce pain on a part of myself I thought long dead, like the jealousy that''s driving through myself right now?  Or is it simply a story, and nothing more?  I tried to say that it was a logical step, a way for me to deal with all that I saw and dealt with on the road of Iraq, but I don't think that's it.  I think that story was one born in anger, concieved in rage, one birthed in betrayal, be it real or make-believe.  And really, I don't know if it's real, or if I have the balls to determine that.    -P. Bradley Robb

      It seems the more circles that you travel in, the more you’re apt to notice things that you might have grazed over the first few times around.  Lately I’ve been revisiting old circles, treading on once familiar ground, finding old names and making them new again.  I also delved deeper into N’s story, bringing to light the issue that I discovered I had.  See, there’s the problem, it’s an issue that I have, not we, not us.  Just me.  I think it’s my problem, and that’s something that I don’t like, because I grew to enjoy the sense of ‘we’ that the two of us shared.   It seems that the lines and boundaries that were pushed and fudged while I was in Iraq, were frankly because I was in Iraq.  Of course, that’s not what I wanted to here.  Granted, it might be what I needed to hear, but not what I wanted to hear.  Really, how fair is it to admit that the strength of your feelings were due in large to the other person being seven thousand miles away and in a greatly realized sense of danger?  Should feelings really fade merely because the situation is that much easier?  Are the worthy things only worthy because they are hard?  Doesn’t that seem a little like dropping out of school a year before graduation merely because everything is suddenly so close? Cold feet, a horrible things.  And the problem is, that I don’t even think that N’s cold feet are totally founded.  Just because I returned to the United States doesn’t necessarily mean that friendship must make the transition to the next level despite how logical (in the purest Platonic reasoning) that transition might be.  Sometimes, hell, a great deal of the time, logic is simply overruled by reality, Plato be damned.  I’m not saying I don’t want our relationship to move up, because I do, but I am saying I think that the level after next would be doom.  Not that I don’t care strongly for N, but frankly, I’ve seen what the world can do to relationships, especially over a distance, and what the world can do, West Point can do better, harder, and faster.  I’ve seen the grey stoned capital of drear cripple more promising relationships than anything else, simply requiring too much of one parties time, simply taking too much without asking.  Requirements of life and soul, blind devotion so obvious and blunt that it breeds cynicism in even the brightest of souls.     Ruining You   I saw a man, I saw a girl. She looked at him, and he at her. She reached for his hand, but he slipped away. "I love you, this is true Every ounce of my being, through and through. But you're just so perfect, I don't know what I'd do. Any time you touched me, I'd just be ruining you. And so I just say: No. No. No. Once to your offer - to take your hand. Once to myself - that I know what I'm doing. Once to my conscience - for I could not live 	with me, ruining you.  I wrote those words a great while ago, when I had the strength to say no and mean it.  Now, I don’t know.  Now I think I’m saying no because of habit, or because of doubt, because I don’t think that the relationship will ever happen.  Perhaps its fear on both of our parts, perhaps age is no prerequisite for having been hurt, perhaps only practice is.  I don’t know, I’m coming up with more questions than I am answers tonight, partially because we left the conversation unfinished, with a promise to do so that I don’t think will ever come to fruition.   So, I returned to my circles, and I returned to my straight lines.  My eyes are still fixed on the coast despite the Army claiming I owe them ten months more than my actual obligation.  I’m sorry, I’ve done my time, five years, and I’m ready to get out, to move on.  I’ve been linking back up with old friends, trying to rekindle old friendships, to supply more fuel to my creative fires, prime the pump so to speak.  I also sent in my paperwork, including my bio and a very selling-oriented synopsis for my book, to my agency.  This was a big thing, I’m usually quite private and humble, at least in the areas concerning my work, preferring to let what I do speak for itself, and trying to sell something hinges on bragging, not something I normally do, not something I’ve ever really been comfortable with.  It might be a dream to approach someone and have them judge my work on it’s own merit, instead of on my ability to sell it, but that’s a dream that I’d honestly like to see. It’s not like N, who just went to bed without rekindling our conversation, choosing instead to remain behind her away message.    I’m going to tangent rapidly away from that topic now, and shift instead to this rather bizarre dream I had the other morning, one that was interrupted by a phone call at nearly the crack of dawn if only 5:32.  Bear in mind that the dream, like most, took place first person, but in the dream, personal identity was fluctuating, meaning who I was drifted back and forth, with memory and time and reality all being flexible, if not insubstantial.  So, in attempt to validate the loss of the end of the dream, a crime in somewhere much more just than the world we live in, I’m sure, I went ahead and turned the dream into a short story.  The ending, any sense of resolution is notably missing, leaving the reader with a sense of unease and questions to be had, if never asked.   Gossamer Barriers  Darien had always felt that something was wrong.  At night he'd have weird dreams about things and places that he'd never seen, things that challenged his imagination to lengths that no one could ever reach.  Yet, dreams aside, he got up every day, he dressed in his thick grey and stained overalls and he went to work the factory.   The country side was alive, Lenin had brought change to the Great Plains and now Russia, now the Soviet Union, had been swept up in the socialist revolution for nearly twenty years.  Darien wasn't much of a political body, but he didn't mind now, he had work, he always had work, and he didn't have to worry about money any more.  Now nobody did.     Lars looked down at the monitor, things were going according to schedule, ReInc 17052 was right on schedule.  Sure, some of his numbers were going a little high, his REM lines were extremely active, pushing the bounds of the reprogramming, but Programmed Reincarnation wasn't an exact science yet, and the closest thing that the late twenty-first century had to offer to time travel.  Lars couldn’t interfere anyway, he could only watch and wait, if the numbers got too bad, he’d have to send another back, drum up another ReInc and have him or her fix 17052.,    Darien was on his way home from work, and he decided that today he’d stop by the gym.  He had been there in a few days and he’d felt the need to put the gloves on.  Boxing was something of a local phenomenon in his small factory town.  Just like nearly everybody worked at the factory, it seemed that all the young men had at one point or another put on boxing gloves, had stepped into the ring, and had smashed their noses into temporary bloody pulps in the quest for some higher glory.  But then, it was the late 30s and money was scares everywhere outside of the Soviet Union, and a bit of fame and national pride was always needed, it certainly couldn’t hurt.  Darien wasn’t much of a boxer, better than those who’d quit early on, but he lacked the real size to get noticed,   so he tried to make up for it in smart, fast, sharp blows.   He’d laced up his gloves and stepped into the ring against another fighter who spent far too much time at the gym, a guy named Igor who was trying his best to get out of the factory.  Igor with his shaved head.  Igor with his shoulders that were far too muscled to be in the same relative weight class as Darien.  Igor who set right off to punishing Darien in the brief few seconds that the opening bell was still hovering in post-ring.  Igor with twelve-ounce punctuation marks, informed Darien that he needed to spend more time in the gym if he really wanted to be taken seriously.  Darien tried to cover as best as he could, but he was forced all over the ring, chased into a corner, and tried to cover himself up as best as possible.  But, it’s only so possible to ever cover so much of yourself, if you chose to save your head, your body will certainly suffer, Igor makes certain of it, and should you be foolish enough to try and save your body…  Lars looked up as his screen flashed, one of his ReIncs was having a problem.  It was 17052 whose stats came up full screen and flashing red on the DRG’s, the German Genetic Research Company, computer screen.  It seems that 17052 had lost consciousness and his numbers were going through the roof.  Darien was in a panic.  The world, it was nothing he’d ever seen.  It wasn’t 1941, it was 2087, and Darien was driving down the freeway, the car was on autopilot, zipping along at speeds that sent the green Arizona fields into a wash, but he wasn’t paying any attention to that.  He was busy flipping through the channels on the Net, trying to find his latest story, the one concerning DRG and their questionable purchases of genetic samples from the deceased.  They’d been doing in for years now, the greater part of the last thirty years, almost the span of the company…but he didn’t find his story, his screen flashed red, the status report from the car flashing to full view and showed a problem with the drive train on the left side of the vehicle.  He saw the whole thing from the outside, as the car slipped into a hard left turn, ripping itself from its lowered position on the road.  Air rushed in and the aerodynamic designed served to turn the car into a swing as it gained uncontrolled lift.  The lift mixed with the turn, creating a tragic cocktail corkscrew end over end as the car met once again with the rubber coated black line of pavement, coming down first on the side, and then as Newton laughed from his grave, the car kept going forward without the benefit of wheels, turning over and over again, half a turn from the direction it should have been traveling.  What was left was a full half mile of pieces and parts, nothing that could really resemble a car or a person.  Darien, or as he’d been called Adrian Barrister, never felt himself die, but he saw it, and he remembered it just as if he’d been there, all the way in 2087.    Lars jammed the page button, a voice as crisp and clear as if his supervisor had been standing behind him came from nowhere and everywhere at once. “Yes?” “We’ve got a problem.  ReInc patient 17052 has regained the memory of his death.”  Darien woke up in the training room of the gym with the school’s ‘doctor’ Sergie, leaning down looking at him with smelling salts in his hand. “Where the?  What happened?” “You lost.  Ha.  That’s what.  Next time, tuck your chin.” “No, what happened with the car?  I was driving, through farmland in Arizona, coming from the beach.  And the wheels.” Sergie looked at him full of doubt and worry, as much as his gruff would allow him. “You don’t look so good.  What’s your name?” “What year is it?” “It’s 1941, same as it’s been all year.” “No, that can’t be.  No.  It’s 2087.” The doctor, and Igor, who’d snuck up behind him, laughed, before they realized that Darien believed himself. “I must’ve hit him harder than I thought.” “What’s your name?” “A…Darien.” “And where are you?” Darien, Adrian, his head hurt, and he strained.  He kept seeing places that never existed, kept clawing at his mind to make sense, but how do you deal with a coin that has two heads? “The gym.  I was boxing…poorly.”  Darien offered up a weak grin., “And the year?” “1941…don’t be a fool Sergie.  I thought you could take a joke.”  That same weak grin worked itself back up.  And Sergie believed him, and Igor helped him to his feet.    Lars leaned over his terminal as a few others had gathered around, including Dieter, the shift supervisor. “See, even though he’s awake, his REM lines are still way up, and they’re corresponding with these numbers, he’s regressing, remembering.” “Well, it’s a good thing it’s already happened.  Send others back, program them to stop him, stop whatever he’s doing.” “What is he doing?” “Give me a second.  I’m gonna pull up the records from the Watcher.”  As Darien left the gym, the late summer night had faded into a slight chill, it felt good against his skin, trying to whisk away the cold sweat that had been staying that since he’d woken up.  He didn’t know what had happened, but he knew that he didn’t like it.  He couldn’t stop remembering, or dreaming, or imagining, or whatever he was doing.  It all seemed too real.  He could name Presidents of the United States who hadn’t bee born yet, and Actresses and movies and he could type.  How could he type when he didn’t even know how to read?  The only reason he knew how to get around and not walk into the wrong doors was because he was so familiar with the signs, he’d been in the same town his entire life, so how did he feel like he knew so much about a place that didn’t even exist.   He continued walking, he spotted Federov, a guy he’d frankly never liked, but he never interfered with Darien, but today, Darien could see him at a corner, waiting on something as he pretended to read a newspaper.  The two made eye contact, holding it for a second too long.  Darien walked passed, hurrying down the street, only to stop, eyes burned away at the back of his neck.    “Incomplete.  ReInc 16499, Federov Dostlysky, assigned watcher to ReInc 17051 was never accounted for.  Our team has yet to find his body.  His file says that either his tracker had malfunctioned or another company had gotten to him.” “Is that possible?  Could a hacker have gotten into our system?  The Watcher Net is completely separate from OneNet.” “Sir.  I’m just stating what the file says.” “I know, dammit, I can read.”  It was dark out, Darien was slicked with a cold sweat.  Federov had been watching him, he’d beaten that much out him before he’d passed out.  Lucky for him he’d done that when he did.  After word it had gotten ugly.  His mind was washed.  It was 2076, Adrian had just graduated from the School Of Free Journalism and he was ready to take a job at the OneNet Associated Press.  He’d met a German woman, Sylvia, and they loved each other.  They were set to be married.  During the birth of their first child, she’d lost her life, and despite all the miracles of modern medicine, there wasn’t anything that could be done.  It was human error, hers and the medical staff’s, and so no one was to blame.  He’d had a wife!  He’d had a child!  What happened to his son?  What happened to Bryan?   With Federov’s own belt knife, Darien began to dig into him.  He didn’t know what he was looking for. “This better be worth the money.” “The money better be good.” “It’s being transferred to your blank account now.” “Good.  Very good.  Yes.  You  see, some specimens that DRG creates are not programmed, they are sent to exist in case other companies get suspicious.  These, the Watchers, only have a passive tracking device, it only transmits after their death, so that DRG can recover their bodies and the regenerate their memories digitally.” “Other companies?  Suspicious of what?  What is DRG doing?” “You’re money is not that good.” “You’ve got tell me.  They tried to buy the codes for my wife!” “I’m sorry.  I’ve already risked as much as I can afford.”  “Do we have any receptive hosts?  We need to send back another ReInc, loaded with two programs, one to kill 17051 and one to complete his task.” “I’m scanning, it’ll take time before we find hosts and the correct coordinates.  These things take time.  Besides, we’ve got all the time in the world, whatever he’s done, it can’t have changed anything for the worse.” “Do not lecture me on the principles of Continuum, I’ve been doing this for nearly twenty years.” “Yes. Sir.”  It wasn’t there, Darien dug and dug, he didn’t see Federov’s face, only the optically obscured visage of his informant, hiding in the shadows and behind technology just incase trust was not what it seemed.  True, with DRG, nothing was what it seemed.  But he’d told Adrian that there was a transmitter, and now he had to look.  Federov had to be working for them, even though they weren’t there yet, he had to be, just as Darien had to be.  No, no, he couldn’t.  They tried to buy his wife, and they had to have killed him.  He was getting to close to them, he would have spilled their secrets all over the OneNet and once he did that, every hacker worth her salt would be working on their systems, and then the power of the digitial frontier would be at unleashed upon them.  No one was safe, not when anyone, everyone in the world had the ability to scream loud and electronically “Bullshit!”  “I’m so glad you’ve come in.  We found your husband mutilating the corpse of a fellow citizen.” “Are you certain?” “I’m afraid so, he was found with the deceased’s knife in his hand, he, I’m sorry to tell you this, he was prying at the bones, trying to dig and screaming in what seemed to be…. English.” “That’s not possible.  My Darien doesn’t speak English.  We, we can’t even read.” “I know only what we saw, and this, this is what we saw.” “Please.  You must let me speak to him.  I’m his wife.” “Darien?”  Her pale, short fingers pushed at the side of his face.  He looked like a beast, wild, rabid, hungry.   But, she couldn’t fear him, couldn’t fear her own husband.  It just wasn’t right.   Adrian looked up from where he was shackled to the Russian prison wall.  “The shackles, they’re for his own protection, and yours.  He keeps screaming and attacking, wanting to know which of us were, he says people have been sent after him.” A spark of recognition flashed across Adrian’s eyes. “Darien, it’s me, your wife.  I’m here now.” “Sylvia?  But you died.” “Sasha, my name is Sasha.  We’ve been married for seven years now.” “Sylvia, what happened to our son?  What happened to Brian?” Sasha started to cry.  Tears blossomed at her eyes and rolled down her cheeks, cutting furrows in the dirt that she’d yet to wash off, being pulled out of her night shift at the factory. “My dear, darling, Darien, we’ve not been able to have a baby.  The doctor says I’m barren.” “No.  No.  No.  No.  No!  We had a child, his name was Bryan Barrister and he was born in August 2076, the same year, the same day that you died.” “He’s been going on like that since we found him.  He keeps speaking of dates and times and places that don’t exist.” “They do, just not yet.  Right now, it’s 1941.  World War is upon us.”  “We have three matches, all prepared to give birth within five years of when 17051 was reincarnated.” “Send them all.  Two Progs and one Watcher.  I want to know what happened.” “Both Progs to carry out the same function as 17051?” “Yes.” “Very good sir.”  “Oh, they sent us back, they reincarnated us Sylvia.  They put us here, a century and a half before we live, so that we could do their work for them.  If only I could have found out what they were up to.  Those Germans.  Those damned fucking Germans.  They sent us here.” “You were sent here by the Germans?” “You can’t believe him, he’s not sane.  Look at him.  Listen to him.  He’s been going on like this for hours.” “Why did the Germans send you here?” “Because I was an American, and I was getting to close.  I couldn’t help it.  I love you, Sylvia, and when you died, and they wanted to buy your remains.  I couldn’t help it, I had to know why.  I had to.  I had to. “Why did the Germans send you here?” “To blow up the factory.  To cripple the Russian juggernaut.  ‘So that Hitler and his thugs’ as FDR put it, puts it.  Has Pearl Harbor been bombed yet?  So that Hitler could take Stalingrad.” “We have to arrest him for espionage.  He’s a spy!” “He’s not, he’s sick, he needs help.” “If you killed me, you’d just be doing them a favor.  I can’t blow up the factory.” “What?” “They’ll send another to do it.  They’ll keep sending people.  That’s how time works.  They, oh, how could I have been so blind.  They wanted me to blow up the factory because it would kill you Sylvia.  But, I couldn’t do that.  I couldn’t kill you.  I couldn’t lose you again.  I just got you back.  “We’ve retrieved the records from the second Watcher.  It seems that 17051 suffered a concussion that damaged the wall between his subconscious programming and his consciousness.  He remembered a great deal of his life, and he remembered his mission.” “Yes.  It also seems that he murdered number 16499.  He seems to have been looking for the transmitter.” “Yes.  16499 was cremated due to severe mutilation, pre and post mortem,  That explains why our search team wasn’t able to detect the traces of radium.  They were washed away on the street.”  By the morning, despite being locked away in a cell, the news of Darien’s lapse into inanity had spread through the small Soviet hamlet.  As the day shift took most of the town’s men to the factory, it was all they could talk about.  He’d gone insane, said he was an American spy sent by the Germans.  How could that be?  He was born and raised in that very town.  His parents had lived and died there.  Igor had felt guilty about it, but he pushed it out of his mind, telling himself that he was not responsible, Darien had made the decision to get into the ring, no one had forced him.   Darien sat still chained to his cell.  A doctor had been sent up, and he’d over heard the word schizophrenia.  But he wasn’t, he wasn’t crazy.  “It’s 1941.  My name is Darien.  I don’t want to blow up the factory.” “Very good.  But we still can’t let you out.” “You don’t understand, do you?  This isn’t about us.  This isn’t even our decisions.  All of this has already happened.  We don’t have any choice.” The guard he was yelling at turned away and turned to his vodka and his partner. “It must be nice, you know, to believe that man is not in control of his own decisions, that others somewhere are in fact in control of things.” “Ha!  Perhaps they could do something about the winter.” Both the guards laughed as they returned to reading the paper, the latest repots were in concerning the war in Europe.  Hitler was marching with what he called a blitzkrieg.  In the darkness of a tiny Russian hamlet, only existing because of the ammunition factory, where the only motor vehicles were those of the government, trucks sent to cart in supplies and out product.  All was quiet.  Adrian, or Darien, had stopped crying in his cell.  It was time to rest.  He could do no more.  THat's quite enough for tonight, a poem, a post, and a short story.  All before 10:30, parents should still know where they're children are, if only we were so lucky for ourselves.  -P. Bradley Robb

      The Story of N and K  or  A Tale of Two Women  Both and N and K have a odd roles in my life with varying and shifting importance.  The thing is, I don’t know which is more important nor do I know if either is really where I want it or if I’m ready, willing, or able to deal with the consequences of either.  K’s tale  K and I met during the first days of my freshman year of high school.  I was new to the school system and went in with a revamped image, wearing a rock-band t-shirt and a ponytail.  No one knew me, and no one knew any better.  K was in both my English and History class, and she was the cute little blond who was just itching to rebel.  We flirted back and forth for years, finally dating when both of us had it in our schedule the summer before our senior year.  It was a hell of a time, with both of us pushing the terms of friendship, creating deep bonds that have yet to prove completely broken and it’s been nearly nine years.  I was K’s first, or as she would later put it, I ‘stole’ her virginity.  We lasted four months.  Three years later, after a stint of near hatred, in which love was replaced by an equally strong emotion, our lives worked back into each other.  It was the summer before I was going to the Academy and perhaps it was just the right place at the right time, or perhaps I was reeling after coming off of a relationship that had turned out to be much more personally devastating than I’d intended, or perhaps it was just bad luck.  But I took her to Georgia for a wedding and we found love again and launched into a whirlwind for eight of the nine months that we dated.  The last month was much more of disaster recovery than a whirlwind, and there was a great deal of damage.    N’s tale  I met N the first day I was at West Point.  Her room was right next to mine, we were in the same Cadet Basic Training (CBT or ‘Beast Barracks’) squad.  N was like no one I’d ever seen and it took a little while for her to grow on me, and I’m fairly certain that it was the same for her.  Oddly enough, she was the same height as K, whom I had just started dating again at the time.  But that’s where the similarities end.  N was sweet, innocent, virginal, and profoundly religious.   With her room being right next to mine, she’d often come over and just chat, she’d complain about how she missed her boyfriend and I’d complain about how I missed K.  We’d swap stories about what the other had done, or what we’d done for the other and we found solace in missing our significant others together.  Of course, Beast ended and N and I would up in the same academic company, which meant that we’d be around each other in one respect or another for at least the next ten months.  Of course we didn’t see each other too often, with her being busy as a cheerleader and myself being busy hating life at the academy.    Intertwining Tales  Christmas break came and it proved to be the climax of my relationship with K.  It was around that time that I’d decided I didn’t want to stay at West Point and I’d begun to look at other colleges.  At first I’d planned to go to Georgetown, to transfer down there and get a degree in Political Science (the same degree I’d intended to get at West Point), to go back home and be with K and just figure out my life from there.   Then I’d sat down and taken a good look at where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do, nixing Georgetown and instead choosing to stop detouring my life and instead move forward, something I’d only been halfway doing since I’d left my house at eighteen.  This didn’t go over well with K, she saw it as me pushing her away, at running, at making rash decisions.  It wasn’t, not really, I just wanted to move my own life forward.  Regardless, the problems that my career decisions caused with K were completely forgotten over the two weeks or so that I spent with her over Christmas.  It was a time of fervent sex, of tears from her and comfort from me, of wonder and beauty and a closeness that neither of us had felt before.  She’d left expecting a ring shortly, and I’d left thinking that nothing like that couple happen again. I’d left and been swept up in my second semester at West Point.  I knew that if I left before August I’d have to go back to the Army.  Not that I had anything against the Army, but returning was a lot like going to Georgetown, it was a detour from where I knew I needed to go, so I had to really buckle down, to keep my grades up and my head down in order to make it through the semester and the summer so I could resign in peace, one piece.  And second semester hit me much harder than the first had.  It was difficult and it required much more of my time.  K didn’t like this, the closeness that we’d shared over Christmas had not left her, she had become addicted to it, she’d wanted more of it and it had ingrained itself upon her mind in a word that we’d both spoken, marriage.  Add to this that N was once again in the same squad, and things got as interesting as they got scary.  I lost myself in school, lost myself in writing and reading when I wasn’t working, found myself in a terrible depression that I just wanted to be left alone with, and K tried beyond what I could consider normal human bounds to reach me, doing her best to cement herself in my daily life.  That’s a significant task from a thousand miles away, but she did her best.  And as things went down hill, I looked to N for support, because she’d been around for the majority my second relationship with K, at least from my end.  They’d only met twice, once at the first beginning of the academic year, however briefly, and once during the freshman formal, known as Plebe Parent Weekend, which had taken place in October.  But, as things went downhill with K things were going up with N.  I didn’t mean for it to happen, and I told myself I couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t be in a relationship with a cadet, especially one so starkly different than myself, than what I was used to, than what I was looking for, from where I was going.  I certainly couldn’t love her, only I did, and I’m pretty sure that I still do, but that line of friendship has never been crossed.   And then I decided to resign.  I just couldn’t stay at the academy any longer, couldn’t pretend.  I’d been hooked up with a guy who also wanted to write and he dug what I could do.  He wanted me to leave and go to LA with him, to just give it a shot, and frankly, if I could make it, doing what I really wanted to do without spending another few years idle, in a path that would eventually lead me to where I wanted to go, than all the better, right?  The only thing that stood between me and my dreams were about fifteen months, to be spent in the Army.  During that time I cut K out of my life, ended it with her, as painful as she made that, and was close with N, as close as two friends could be, with lines being flirted with but never crossed, as she was already beginning to be taken by another one of our classmates. So I left and went to Texas, a pit stop on my way to Iraq.  While there, I don’t know if it was a need for a relationship, or if N was just being nice, being herself, but those lines we’d been flirting with had vanished.  She’d broken up with the other cadet she’d been seeing and perhaps the two of us were just lonely.  We didn’t agree to anything, there was nothing concrete or formal, no declaration of intent, but the word love was used, if only as closings to letters, email, instant messages, and phone calls.  Turning Burning Wheels  After I got back from Iraq, life once again sought to redefine all of my relationships.  K started talking to me, and after a series of arguments where I told her exactly what I thought about her, her life, and why her life isn’t part of my life, a lot of the tangled strands of burnt bridges that had existed between us were swept away.  Now it’s just odd, now I’m a confidant, someone she wants in her life.  N is stuck in a very similar spot I was a year ago, stuck with the weight of the academy pushing down on her.  She’s changed a bit, still very nice, but with a certain sense of cold, of cynicism that’s always bred the second year at the academy.  She works very hard, and I know that the amount of work she’s facing at school.  I try and understand, to be considerate, but I’m left wondering that since there’s no longer seven thousand miles separating us, whether the ease of communication is what perhaps has stinted what we had before.  It might be fear, it might be school, it might just be that she’s moved on and she’s seeing someone else.  But what I’m confronted with is two opposite situations.  The first is with K, where I’m relating more than I want to with one person, and the other with N, where I feel I’m not relating enough.  I’ve sworn off marriage, not wanting to do so for at least a good while.  I’m not even looking for a relationship until I get out to LA, to meet someone out there, to look for the diamond in the roughest of roughs.  And all that aside, I still wish I was closer with N.  Maybe it’s because she was there for me when I needed her, maybe it’s because I love her, or maybe because somehow I feel she’s stronger than me, and in life we all flock to those stronger than us.

      It’s amazing how on a day when so little was actually accomplished how tired I can be.  It must have had something to do with last night.  Last night being the first time in a good while I that I didn’t imbibe in a great deal of alcohol in the hours before bed.  I don’t think that I have a problem with drinking, it’s just that I am a great deal more productive when I am.  Or perhaps it’s because today was spent facing a great many ghosts.  I was facing ghosts I didn’t know I had, dealing with the things that I miss a great deal about places I didn’t think I could ever miss.  Places like both West Point and Iraq.  One of the great things that’s been bothering me about Iraq is that it seems to have gotten so much worse since I left.  Not that I have some egotistically delusional belief that I, nor my unit, was some sort of glue that held Iraq into a semblance of peace, if only when compared to what is going on there now.  Nor do I feel the need to go back, but I sit here, and I receive word through the military channels that aren’t reported on the major news sources.  They’re nothing too dramatic, just short informal briefs that normally start with something like “Just thought you just might want to know…”  if they weren’t confirmed through multiple sources, they could almost be written off as rumors.    Following PT this morning, I swung across the street to the mini-mall to grab what I had intended to be coffee and donuts, but the lure of hot food from the A&W paired with the chill outside and the lack of any hot water or heat in the barracks pulled me in.  I ended up eating with a buddy of mine who I met on R&R in Qatar.  Through casual conversation he brought up that he’d heard that Ibrahim, our civilian contracted translator had been killed.  It’s rough news hearing that someone you knew has died and of course, only coming from one source, I tend to be skeptical.  It’s my nature.  Later, a good friend, the guy who I trusted my life to more times that I wish to recall on countless convoys through places in Iraq that the media didn’t even like to go in, called and wanted me to double check on Ibrahim’s death.  It all clicked then.  He’d heard it all, a brief had been sent down through his shop, the Operations Shop, that yes, Ibrahim had been killed, as well as a series of attacks, at least one from inside the perimeter of our former FOB had taken place.  Of course Ibrahim’s death had a greater affect on them, as they had worked more closely with him than I had.  But what got to me was something more than the violent and untimely death of a human being that I had known, but rather a situation that had taken place in the few days prior to my unit’s transition of authority on FOB Normandy.    It was in those last few days that the gaining unit committed a very rookie mistake that unfortunately took place in a very unforgiving locale.  On misjudged intel, given from a machine known as the Q36, or perhaps through some need to judge their worth as the gaining unit, a wedding was accidentally shelled.  Yes, accidents like this can happen, but all things considered, this one shouldn’t have happened.  Not with the circumstance that when the counter-fire mission came up on the computer, roughly half an hour after our unit had given fire control officially over to our replacements, we had indexed without firing around thirty missions that day.  Wedding ceremonies with the widespread use of celebratory gun fire by Iraqis plays havoc with the Q36, generating what are best described as “false positives”.  Luckily, the artillery rounds missed the ceremony itself by two hundred or so meters, but the blasts still claimed the lives of three children and two women, injuring five others.  It was the day after the mistake that I was grabbed, a third body and a third gun was needed as our replacements and my unit’s assigned Fire Support Officer (FSO) were going out to inspect the damage.  News had come back to the FOB that something bad had happened.  As our resident translator, Ibrahim was sent out with us.  We rolled out into one of the harshed, most unforgiving couple of villages in our entire area of responsibility, Dali Abas and the Five Bridges.  Our FSO did his best to inspect, but what can be said, what can be done to an accident like that?  The horrible thing, Ibrahim knew.  It was two days later, the day of the complete Transition of Authority, ceremony and all, the last step in the piece-meal transition that we’d been going through for nearly a week.  Our replacements had been ambushed twice while rolling through the same area in which the rounds had landed.  The horrible thing, we all kept telling ourselves that the Iraqis knew our vehicles from our replacements, which was indeed obvious, ours were tan while theirs were green.  We all kept telling ourselves that we wouldn’t be attacked, and shaking our heads because that was all that we could do, all we could give them to our gaining unit.  But, as I was away from the ceremony taking place, I was standing outside the building which housed the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and smoking a cigarette with Ibrahim, and this is the portion that gave me cause to reflect in utter horror.  Ibrahim was scared for his life, afraid to work with our replacements to the point of tears.  He feared for his life, and though his wife wasn’t in any danger, he feared for her to go on without him.  He was crying, trying to hold it back, but he could only do that for so much of the time.  In retrospect it reminds me of how much Hemingway got it right in For Whom The Bell Tolls, about people knowing that they are going to die.  I don’t believe that Ibrahim somehow fated himself into this situation, I don’t believe that he caused himself to spin his luck south because of his inability to deal with fear.  Rather, I believe his fear was rational, that he was in a bad situation that was only growing worse.  A sense of plausible expectations had grown between my unit and the locals, where a sort of respect was given, the rules of course were too subtle to be spoken and had anyone attempted to, their words would have been immediately refuted by either side as a lie.   “Of course ‘no quarter’ was given, nor was any asked, after all, this was a war.”   But, after a year of working together, both sides, rather all sides, for there were more than two, knew what to expect generally from the other.  And we’d all grown comfortable in that.  At that moment, and so it seems now, with those lines crossed by those who simply didn’t know, who took at face value that no quarter was given, perhaps by those who believed what they were reading in the papers and seeing on the news, they did turn it into a no quarter scenario, and when that first line is crossed, that first bridge is burned, it’s so damn hard to ever get it back.  It’s amazing how sometimes you can just know, and it’s scary as Hell.  That was my ghost for today.

      So it’s been a night that wasn’t as terribly productive as I’d have wished it to be.  Rather it was terribly connected, but not terrible at all, if you can follow that.  First off, I’m out of absinthe, but I’ve got two more bottles on the way, so that should help if only it didn’t take 5 business days for a courier to make it all the way from Europe.  And foremost, I spent a great deal of the night catching up with old friends from the Academy.  Sounds important right, well, it is and it isn’t.  The Academy, is the United States Military Academy, more commonly referred to as West Point.   A year ago I resigned from that famed and fabled institution.  Today I sat back and I sent people there my reflections, lessons I’ve learned so that they might maybe be better leaders or only not make the mistakes that I did.  Not that I consider leaving the Academy, which I learned I did love only after leaving it, or leaving the Army, which I’m planning to do here within the next few months, to be a mistake.  Granted the Army in all its facets has been a major part of my life over the last five years, and it is largely responsible for crafting the man I am today.  But, I’m responsible enough, or perhaps mature is the more correct word, to be thankful for what the Army has given me and to take the lessons and attributes and move on, move closer towards the goals that I’ve set for myself, to know this creature that I’ve become and to writer and explore and blow the world on it’s ear.  In my MSN Group http://groups.msn.com/NewBohemians for those so inclined to check it out, I’ve been tossing around the phrases “creating art for the sake of art” and “taking popular culture away from old men in suits”.  And the more I saw them, the more I feel they’re applicable.  Call me crazy, but the entire world is moving towards an era where information is universal and able to be accessed at all times from any point on the connected globe, and everyday the connected globe is getting larger as more people take to the internet as a means of social communication.  The sense of privacy is quickly dwindling and people are able to be reached at any time, failure to do so constitutes a minor emergency.   Oh my god!  Steve didn’t pick up his cell phone for three hours yesterday!   And despite the freedom that this sense of connectivity should grant us, with the self-publisher, self-promoter being the true king, the American dream, the modern Rags-to-Riches where riches is defined as deserved privilege be it fame or freedom or monetary compensation, instead you have the RIAA suing college kids for using Kazaa to swap music files when P2P networks have the greatest chance of any musical medium of all time of catapulting an obscure musical group into a household (however hip the house might be) word.  And the RIAA’s response?  Pay per play music download services, which completely destroys the musician’s album as a work of art.  Heaven forbid literature ever gets to that point, where you can pay $0.99 a chapter and just download the portions of a book you like.  It’s this horrid trend that’s pushing me towards wanting a total revolution, a redefining of the entire pop culture medium.  Writers should publish and promote themselves, movies should be made by collectives, bands should be able to record their own music and distribute it as they see fit.  Physical works of art, photographs, they should be readily available through an electronic means so that they can be admired and interpreted anywhere and at any time.   While it’s been said that those who see money as the root of all that’s evil don’t have any, I think that the need for more money has turned the modern popular culture scene into a machine, and it’s driven down quality, and it’s all about milking out one more dime, because a dime spread across a million records is a hundred grand.  I don’t think that the powers that be have any respect for artists as a live long endeavor, we’ve no more Jim Morrison, no more Jimmy Hendrix, no more Ernest Hemingway, no F. Scott Fitzgerald, no Ezra Pound, no Pablo Picasso (though physical artists are having a better time when not merely being allocated to the latest trend); very few people are allowed to push limits anymore, most are milked for their initial commercial success and then allocated to shows on VH1 like  Where Are They Now?   and  The Eighties .  But hey, that’s just how it looks from behind these Bohemian’s blue eyes.  It’s late and I need sleep.

      Written 10 April 04  It's been raining hard all day.  I remember a thunderstorm like this months ago, right before I left for Iraq.  It was big and lonely and quiet.  How apt.  So, the last nine months should have given me plenty of time to pull everything into perspective, all things considered.  They didn't.  Instead it caused me to step outside of the flow of time, essentially becoming a human time capsule.   Yeah, so I went to Iraq.  It wasn’t what I thought it was going to be.  I ended up spending a great deal of my time there running the PX for my FOB.  Yes, I was essentially the sequel to the Kevin Smith film, Clerks.  In fact, for a while I contemplated having a video camera sent out there and producing my own sequel:  Clerks 2 – Iraq.  I even had the one line figured out – War was never meant to be this sarcastic.  But I didn’t.  Granted, I did do other things while I was there, I was on a great deal of convoys, which means I was shot at, blown up, shot back, and gambling against all odds a great deal of the time.  I got tasked out onto other missions, security for public meetings, was there for the first graduating class of the ICDC (Iraqi Civil Defense Corps) and saw the first day of school.    But of all the things that I accomplished in Iraq, the thing that I am most proud of is writing my novel.  See, sitting there for nine months allowed me a great deal of time to partake in that oh so dangerous past time, the kind that has been responsible for more upheaval and calamity than any other in the history and prehistory of all of mankind: thinking.  That’s right, I did it, and I’m willing to admit it.  I took all the things that had been bothering me, or that I’d been giving thought to, and I put them all into a book.  But, instead of just letting the book sit there and moving on with life, as so often seems the case, I’ve been aggressively attempting to get it published.  I’ve been cold lettering agents, I’ve been researching, and I’ve hit some measure of success.  I’ve been accepted by an agency called ST Literary Agency (www.stliteraryagency.com).  And I’ve hit a snag.  See, my grand philosophy on life is somewhere in the 200 or so pages of my novel.  But I want access to it now.  I want to know what it is that I think about everything indexed and at my fingertips.  So, in order to figure all that out, I’ve started this blog and  a group on MSN http://groups.msn.com/NewBohemians so that I could figure out where I’m going, and in the grand fashion of Kerouac, if anyone else was heading along the same path I was.  I figure there’s six billion or so people in the world, someone out there has got to be looking at the same thing I am.

      So, guilty as charged, operating a computer connected to the internet while under the influence of absinthe.  But that’s the way it goes, isn’t it?  Absinthe just being the little shove, or in my case the seven little shoves, which got me going in the right direction.  I started this blog, something I never thought I’d do, and the afore mentioned Bohemian group on MSN.  And then I jumped onto the instant messenger.  I think I held my own on there, really, no one made any comments on my state of sobriety.  But enough about that, right?  The strings behind the means, what was I doing?  I’m trying to figure out where I am by pinging off other people, by forcing situations and seeing what the results, judging who I am by how I react and how I feel.  But nothing was tangible, and I didn’t write anything down, so it was all lost with the hangover.    What I did manage was to find something that I’d written a short time before I left for Iraq, it’s sort of a measuring stick, to see how I feel now compared to how I felt then.   When dealing with the balance of my life, there’s always that balance attempted to be reached between violence and creation.  It’s as if I’m trying to reach my own balance between creation and destruction.  How can on really separate the two?  The need to create is something that is inherent in all of us.  The concept of God is one of ultimate creation.  But, he’s not just a creature of creation.  In Genesis, God destroys the world in a flood.  In Revelations, he destroys the world with Fire.  Man grapples with the concept throughout the span of his life.  His death is unavoidable.  It’s there, from the time that Man discovers what exactly death is, that he must face the fact that, at one time, death will claim him.  For the rest of his life, the remainder of his days, man tries to create something greater than death, something that will outlive him, something that will remain beyond his days.  Therein lies the concept of creation.  Whether man is creating children or attempting to create something larger, something that reaches a larger group: all attempts to outlive death hinge on one concept.  Death can not be cheated, but the tangible can survive it.  By remaining in the minds of the masses, or even in the minds of a few, is perhaps the only realistic way that man can life forever.  As far as violence goes, as the opposite pairing for destruction, violence is Man’s attempt to act on their own primal fear.  If man must die eventually, than the ultimate compliment is to try and control the uncontrollable.  If one must die, than the ultimate compliment to death is imitation.  Flatter the uncontrollable.  It’s the mastering of these two aspects of grappling with one concept that every man must face.  You’re going to die.  I’m going to die.  We’re all going to die.  How you deal with that fact is how you really measure your life.   What was it that I was saying in there?  One, man is certainly an imitation of God, even if God is a creation of man.  Drift around that circle for a while.  Man has a single control factor in his life, he is going to die.  And after the age of six or so, when mortality becomes all to apparent, death becomes something that has to be faced.  Eventually, it is realized that death can not be cheated.  Look at the wording, death can’t be beaten through realistic means, not by the rules inherent, no, you have to cheat it.  As best as I can figure, and I’m still sticking with this, there are only two plausible ways to cheat death, two cases of quasi-immortality.  The first is through children, who will have at best a two-fold second hand immortality.  The first is half of your genetic code will be carried on.  The second fold is that your memory will be maintained in the minds of your children.  Of course this extends to all the people that you meet, but those memories are biased, and well, the power and accuracy, or lack there of, of memory has already been well documented.  The second manner to achieve this partial immortality, and by far the more accurate of the two, is through your art.  Of course, neither of these actually have any affect on your own death, neither stop or postpone anything.  Some might argue that children will inevitably speed your towards death, but as I’m staying single for a time, I wouldn’t be able to comment on that.  It all comes down to just one thing:  who am I, and why, or rather what do I want people to remember me for?

      It's All In The Title  It’s been a couple of days, but then I’m on vacation.  I made it out, embarking on my great adventure.  Last night, my first night in Manhattan in over a year, was like a return to the Bohemia of my novel.  We walked into Minetta’s, the room was crawling with suits, empty all around.  I sat down at the bar, the bar tender asked if I was over 21, didn’t ask for ID, merely took my word on in.  I smiled.  I ordered a drink.  From there we slipped over to Café Reggio and had ourselves some coffee.  It was cold out.  I sat outside and smoked cigarettes and had my first New York coffee in so long, in too long.  And while I sat there, and the truly die hards were out, the ones who are willing to go out and act without thought of consequence on a Tuesday night, for Tuesday is the historic day of bad things – overshadowed by it’s neighbors, Monday (who gets all the credit for bad things) and Wednesday (the hump day).  I sat there, and smoked, and started conversations with passers-by.  I met a Brazilian woman, somewhere in her thirties who first asked for a cigarette and then got a conversation.  Turns out she moved to the states when she was thirteen, went to college in Europe, went to grad school at Yale, got a degree in film.  We talked, we laughed, she works in the film industry.  I want to work in the film industry.  We exchanged numbers and parted ways.  I haven’t called her, supposed to wait 2 days, I’ll wait more.  There’s a reason why Sammy calls me ‘Double Down’, or perhaps I’ve just taken Swingers too much to heart. MacDougal Street is quickly becoming my stomping grounds.  And I’ve learned that returning to the Hudson Valley brings only cold and rain.  It’s the end of May.  It was sunny and seventy when I landed at La Guardia, it was barely sixty and rainy today.  It was a warm-up to Vancouver, and yet, the same thing happened the last time I was here.  It was May last time too.  I keep coming unprepared.  Or I keep not taking the signs. But, I’m embarked on my own Kerouac journey, my own version of On the Road, though I’m doing it in the air, and I’m on a solid time table, not that I want to return to Texas, but that I have to.  It’s almost over though, almost done.  And I can deal with that.  As long as I know how long I have to last for, I know I can endure.  A sign of a weak mind, but a sign of a mind to say the least.   I can’t wait to get to Vancouver, to see about T, to see if there is something there, or if, well, to see if my heart is playing fill in the blanks for me.  Hearts have a habit of doing that, of smoothing out the edges, of easing problems, oh turning away reality and imposing fantasy.  But I have to push past the fantasy self, now that I know it exists.  I have to allow myself to interpret, and I have to see if what I’m interpreting is what my heart is hinting at.  I don’t know.  Time will tell, the hours of time are winding down.  I fly the morning after tomorrow.  Tomorrow hopefully the weather’ll be nice, I’ll go back to the city, I’ll see things and maybe I’ll find a group of young Bohemians hanging out in the bars and cafes and fighting the good fight against old men in suits.

      Still on duty, though now the sun is starting to come up.  If you could feel what I am feeling, you’d certainly be agreeing with me that 24 hours is a great deal longer than just one day.  I just walked outside to smoke a cigarette, walked into the graying air, and my body is starting to wake up as well, chemicals inside telling me it’s that time again, that even though I didn’t get any rest, it’s time to buckle down and to get things done.  And yet, I’m not done doing all the not-doing that I spent all night and the vast majority of yesterday on.  So I sit back down at the desk, and at my work computer, a lap top with an airwave card, (Thank you, Verizon!). I really wanted to be productive.  I told T once, on a day I was being far too productive that my agent had called me early that day, and his call had triggered something in me that spurred this great urge to be productive, like he’d unknowingly reminded me that I had a great deal to do.  And yet, I couldn’t figure out what I needed to be doing, so I set to cleaning.  She’s taken to reminding me to be productive in emails and messages.  Well, as I noted earlier, it’s impossible to be productive when you’re chained to a desk.   The larger part of the night was a waste.  I did everything I could to stay awake, to fight drifting into the sleep that the other Joe on duty has lapsed into.  He’s been out for about an hour now, and his DVD player keeps running the opening sequence to Paycheck, a movie I’m only glad I watched because now I won’t make the mistake of buying it.  While it did have some redeeming features, an interesting sci-fi twist, on the whole it was rubbage.   The vast majority of the night was spent shifting between my bohemian group  urlLink New Bohemians  , the other, fantasy oriented group I once wrote with and that has been suspiciously inactive these last few days, and other people’s blogs.  I have to say, I’m a bit interested in the resurfaced Andy Kaufman blog.  It’s a marvelous hoax at least, and a very pleasant surprise at best.  Regardless, it’s a wonderful addition to his legacy, the actual author is immaterial.   My personal philosophy towards getting up early, is that whatever woke me up had better either kill me, or get me damn close.  Don’t wake me up early unless it’s for a flight, unless waking up early will somehow better my standing in the world.  Wake me up Tuesday so I can fly to NYC, wake me up Friday so I can fly to Vancouver, to T.  I’m not too keen to be woken up for the flight back on Monday, or the flight to back to Texas two days later, but flights out, flights away are good.  My body, right now, is informing me just how close it’s come to death tonight.  I can march, I can run, I can fight, but sitting, eating junk food, living on coke, smoking on a rapidly-regular basis, doing all so sober, it has a horrible affect on the body.  The stomach clenches and rolls at the same time.  I don’t think I need to tell you just how unpleasant that is.  Skin pales, body cools, head starts to hurt, eyes hurt from the constant exposure to florescents, and dry out from being held open against their will.  I did every thing I could to stay awake.  I walked around.  I showered.  I took a single of Jack rather quickly.  I brushed my teeth.  I watched a painful movie.  I tried to find people on the internet, but without the ease of chatrooms on AOL, where the truly lonely and bored have nothing better to do than chat, things got lonely.  Not that I mind being alone, but company could have kept my attention, could have kept me awake.  As it is, from the two packs of cigarettes I bought Friday afternoon, I have five lonely smokes left.  I should run today, but after I wake up I’m just going to be too busy. Funny how life works out like that.  Sentenced to a small eternity of doing nothing while just on the horizon, just on the other side of forever, there’s a world of things to do.  Packing, cleaning, laundry, phone calls, PCIs and PCCs (Pre – Combat Inspections / Checks).  And then I’m gone.  I’m free, and running so fast that I’ll ensure that my Texas life can’t catch up with me, if only for a bloated week.  Eight days.  Eight days of running; it’ll almost be like a revamped, reissue of the old days.  Only with jets.  I don’t know.  Right now I’m just keeping myself company, and I’m certain that my blog is going to suffer from it.  But that’s the point isn’t it?  This is what goes on in my mind, in the same language, pounded out without editing, without though, as fast as my long, and practiced fingers can carry them.  Thoughts, turned into actions, turned into electrons, and then BAM! Cyberspace baby.  Where’d that word go?  Why isn’t it called cyberspace anymore?  Has the internet lost it’s romantic mysticism because it’s in everyone’s house?  Because everyone has their own blog?  Because you don’t need to know HTML or JAVA script any longer?   I miss those days.  I miss dial-up BBSs.  But they’ll never be back, and it’s not pointless to look back, we’ve come so far already that we’re being overwhelmed by nostalgia.  Topgun, by BBS of yester-year, was a close-knit family.  We chatted, we posted, we’d meet at Denny’s and have coffee and smoke cigarettes.  We dated amongst, we fought amongst, we factioned and cliqued, and when it all fell apart, we still all knew each other.  Now, how many people do you know on the internet that you didn’t know before you logged on?  Throw out the people you meet on dating services.  Throw out the kids you went to high school with and found later on  urlLink Classmates.com .  Now, come up with a number.  It’s ridiculously small, isn’t it?  The internet is like a giant shopping mall now, if you didn’t go with friends, you’re not going to know anyone there, and if you meet someone there, it’s only cause you’re looking to score.  There’s no more digital friends.  Those days were gone before the majority of people online even knew they existed.  Well, except for the Cassiopeans, but I’m not going to touch them.

      Sitting at a desk for a day straight, no sleep, no breaks.  It should prove the ultimate time to get something accomplished, a means to do without a viable excuse not to.  And yet, nothing gets done, it’s one long stream of conscious, one litany of thoughts, riddled with self-pity, and fueled, aided, abetted by the poor guy chained to the desk next to you.  It’s small catastrophes dotted with hopes for originality, and yet, it’s the second Saturday in a row I’ve done this.   The good thing, it kills two days.  24 hours for two days?  Doesn’t the saying go if you sleep twelve hours a day you’re only there for half the time?  Well, yes, but if you’re awake for 24 hours, your sense of time diminishes, and the resulting crash causes time to speed at an exponential rate, resulting in one very long day and one day that vanished before you’re even truly aware that it existed.  I’m still not even sure that there are 24 hours in a day, I think that days are actually shorter, as anyone who’s done something for a full 24 hours can attest.  24 hours is a great deal longer than any day.    I’ve tried to be productive, I really have.  I dug into one of my screenplays, a film called  Fleeting , an existential piece whose aim is to get everyone to question how they are living their lives.  I’ve said time and time again that a 401k is a suicide note.  Really, what good is planning for a future when you never know whether you’re going to get there?  Death comes so easily, taking who it chooses.  I can look back at the times when I should have died, but didn’t and those when others should have lived, and yet, dumb luck robbed them of that.  Even outside of a war situation, life is not guaranteed.  Last year 248 Americans were killed in Washington D.C., our nation’s capital.  These are homicide numbers.  These were not soldiers, these were not men and women who’d agreed to put themselves in harm’s way, these were men and women just doing their best to make it through life.  114 people die every day from car accidents in the US alone.  And yet, people will still lock themselves down in jobs they don’t want, with the hope that one day they’ll be able to retire and finally live life like they want to.  Is it too much to want to live life on your own terms before you start collecting social security?  Is that really so unrealistic?  Am I really trying to change the world?  Yes.  Yes I am.  This world needs some help, people have become consumers.  It’s time to open some eyes.

      I should be motivated, what with life waiting just out of grasp and every moment of every day drawing me a minor increment closer to where I know I want to be.  Tuesday afternoon I’ll be landing in New York City.  Friday morning I’ll be flying out to actually meet T, the girl who signs emails with ‘luv’ and who typos on such a regular basis, and I’ll be going to a house that should be a home, but it’s more like a capsule away from time and space that is everything the rest of the world, the green grassed Pleasantville that my family relocated to, and yet, the words all jumble around in my head, and sleeping seems to be the only think I want to do, and half the time I’m too bored to even do that, and it’s not writer’s block, if that’s what you’re thinking, it’s life block.    So, I light another cigarette and change the songs on the stereo yet again and I continue to try and pound out, to find that old familiar rhythm that lets me do what I Really want to do, write and live.  And it kills what little amount of living I’m doing right now because I know that in just a few short days I’m not going to have time to write, or that I shouldn’t.  I’ve got so much crammed, not planned, but actually there, into eight short days, that I’m wondering if I’m going to have time to do that sleeping thing at all.  And yet, now, that seems to be all I’ve done.  Tomorrow I won’t be, another long day, another twenty-four hour shift, which would be longer if I hadn’t scheduled to leave on Tuesday, the line I got was 24 on, 24 off, not a way to spend life, not a way to avoid anything other than utter burn out.  Once again, I escape just in the nick of time, that odd sense of luck I’ve had for my entire life is once again carrying me on.  Sometimes I wish I didn’t have that luck, but when it’s not there, I’m oh too keenly aware just how painful life is, just how much it demands and just how little it can give back.   And so I sit at my work computer and I pound away at the keyboard, trying vainly to draw something from within myself.  It used to be that in times like this I’d return to one of the many sources of pain that have served so faithfully as muses over the years.  Loves lost, problems at home, issues never fully addressed and that always remain bleeding if just below the surface, waiting to gush, waiting to flow through my fingertips and onto the keyboard, out the bottle, into the cup, and back into myself again.   Yet now, perhaps war, perhaps the heat of Iraq just burned them shut, cauterized them, perhaps I learned there are worse things that being hurt and living through it.  Or perhaps I just learned that I could put myself away and do what I was told to do because it was better than being yelled at.  I don’t know.  I still don’t know Iraq.  A lot of my friends still have those youthful illusions about the grandeur of war, that it’s better to be over there and suffering than here and missing out.  Survivor guilt, only worse, because it’s never-tried guilt.  I try and tell them that’s not what they want, that no one really wants to go to war, and those who think they do should think about what it is that they really want.  It’s not war, it’s not pain, it’s not suffering, or death, and it’s not the positives, it’s not helping people out, helping a nation that was brutalized from within, subjected and demoralized into a shell of a nation that more resembled Auschwitz than a desert paradise.  No, they want the same validation that every child wants, they want to be hurt, so they can wear their pain on their sleeve, on their collar, and on their chest, so that the whole world knows that they are adults now.  And yet, I know I am, and everyone else does too, but I don’t feel that much different.  Now I’ve just got a trump card, hey, I’m not a kid, don’t treat me as one, ‘cause I did something, and it hurt.  Sometimes I don’t know how much it hurt, and others, like now, I realize just how much it might have set me back.  “You have to be hurt like hell in order to write seriously,” Hemingway, so why am I have trouble doing that now?  I didn’t when I was over there, the story I told, not the story I created, but the one that flew from me, that demanded itself to be presented to the world, I had no trouble with.  I feel like I almost got over, as if my luck was continuing to push me along some path to somewhere it knows clearly, and yet I’ve only been able to get glimpses of, and still don’t know how true those glimpses were.

      I think that insane ideas have a specific gravity of their own.  And the more insane others claim them to be, the more force they build up.  I know that seeing T drew some level of shaken heads from friends, but now that I’m flying of to actually met her, a few have decided it a good idea and others feel that it’s just utterly insane, and expensive if I’m just trying to get laid.   And here’s the thing.  I’m not just trying to get laid.  I mean, granted, it’d be nice, but I’m actually hoping that there’s a connection there, something real, something more substantial than emails and photographs and late night conversations across the great digital divide.  I’m hoping that there’s something palpable, something tangible, something real, because after N, after the let down that would have passed the border of betrayal if I didn’t care for her so much, I need to know that I can feel excited about companionship again.  Not that I’m gun-shy, but rather that I’m perhaps worried about a half-assed rebound instead of a rebirth into the social game, the primordial pool.   Perhaps it’s all a test, a means of checking the fantasy self against the second self of another, to see if I can truly get to know another’s second self, instead of trying to put together a jig-saw puzzle by throwing the pieces at a table from across a room.   But, now that I’m coming to a time in my life where, realistically, I’ll have more freedom than ever before, I think I’m entitled to do crazy things, like hope on a plane to meet someone for the first time and to see how things go from there.  Soon they’ll be no such thing as AWOL, no more formations – it’s foolish to think that there won’t be any ramifications for my actions, but they certainly won’t carry the same gravity that the Army is able to produce, reductions in pay, rank, and free time.    Besides, I’m a writer, and thusly, an artist.  I’m not only allowed to be spontaneous, but it’s encouraged.  Isn’t it?  I’m going to go with yes.

      So, I've been giving serious contemplation to my personal philosophy.  I really need to come up with a name for it.  But, I wrote up a short, 650 word, treatment of it and sent it to my old Philosophy professer, Maj. K, at West Point.  Oddly enough I got a response almost right away.  Here's the treatment    Shattered Mirror Lives  By  P. Bradley   	We don’t exist; not in the easy melding of self to body manner that has become so commonplace.  We can’t exist this way because every action that is taken, every word that is spoken, every letter that is written, every note that is hummed is completely open to interpretation, and as the interpretations of others can not be controlled, often not even foreseen, as people we are being interpreted by others on a continual basis.  The only person who completely knows and understands a person, is you.  And the only person that you are able to completely understand is yourself.  Your ‘self’.  	Everyone is on an intimate level of understanding of their own first self: who they are, why they do what they do, the inner-monologue that runs constantly.  Due to the limitations of the five sense, no one else is privy to the inner workings of another’s first self.  We can only interpret what we see, what we touch, what we hear – and our own first self determines what we believe to be the self of the other.  We determine the second self of another.  Thus, for every person that you come in contact with, you determine their second self.  Likewise, every person that you come in contact with determines your second self.  Were there only two people in all of existence there would only be four selfs.  Were there three people, there would be nine selves:  a first self per person, and each person would have two second selfs, one from each of the other two people.  Thus the amount of second selfs that each person has is directly proportional to the amount of people that they’ve come in contact with during the entire length of their existence, and will continue to grow with every day.  	Of course, while the first self is rooted in personal knowledge, and the second self is formed out of eye-witness accounts, and personal interpretations, the fantasy self is based wholly on perceived interpretations.  Fantasy selfs are formed through second hand accounts, seeing someone, hearing about them, reading about them.  As you read this you’re forming a fantasy self about the author.  As this is written, the author is forming a fantasy self for the reader.  While a second self is formed for every person met, creating a relatively large number; that number pales when compared with the sheer amount of fantasy selfs generated over the course of a life time.  Every person seen on television, heard on the radio, noticed in a crowd, brought up second hand in a conversation, each person has a fantasy self formed just by having a name.  Thus, the sheer number of fantasy selfs that exist is tremendously large, a number too large for the human mind to comprehend.    	Of the three types of self, the fantasy self is the closest to static, only changing in the direction and manner that the possessor chooses.  The first self is utterly dynamic, as we all change, every action that affects us, everything we read, see, hear, contemplate, all have affects on us, even if those affects are merely one more thing that we’ve done, seen, heard, or thought about.  Do not think that this makes the first self unstable, rather it is continually growing.  Just as the author’s first self changed through the course of writing this essay, the reader’s first self changed while reading it.  This constant changing is the reason why no other person can ever fully understand another’s first self.  The second self fills the intermediate between someone’s first self and the fantasy self that once existed concerning them.  The second self is more dynamic than static, changing as new information is revealed and interpreted,  changing more and more the closer one person gets to another, changing more as one attempts in vain to realize another’s first self.   ***  I plan to get more indepth into this, I've already hashed out the applications towards art, in an attempt to answer my own question as to what an artist is, and I'm working on the moral/ethical applicaitons, but I'm thinking those are going to borrow heavily from Existentialism and Egoism.  Rand and Sartre beware.

      So, I've been screwing around with my profile, settings on here, and alawys with the three selfs in my mind.  When I entered in my birthday it didn't actually print it, oh no, the folks at Blogger are smarter than that, or if not smarter, than certainly more wily.  They went ahead and gave my European astrological sign - scorpio, as well as my chinese calander sign - monkey.   Here's some fantasy self for you:   Monkey   People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever, skillful, and flexible, they are remarkably inventive and original and can solve the most difficult problems with ease. There are few fields in which Monkey people wouldn't be successful but they have a disconcerting habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave their projects. Although good at making decisions, they tend to look down on others. Having common sense, Monkey people have a deep desire for knowledge and have excellent memories. Monkey people are strong willed but their anger cools quickly. They are most compatible with the Dragon and Rat.    Scorpio   As the eighth sign of the zodiac, Scorpio represents the eighth stage in the evolution of man and his place in the universe. This stage is concerned with an emotional development that goes beyond Cancerian concern with home and family. Scorpio's emotional involvement is not based on love or pleasure, but on the control and understanding of human emotions and the role they play in the mysterious process of life and death. Though all Scorpios do not spend their lives pondering the mysteries of life and death, most of them are inquisitive, probing individuals. They are fascinated with how things work, especially people. Their mental and physical powers of recuperation are remarkable, and truly evolved Scorpios can learn to use their power to help and inspire others.    Take from that what you will.  I chatted with T for a bit, she's at work now.  I'll talk to her more after she's off.  Something worth staying awake for.

      So, I’ve gone over my present dating habits so completely in my mind that I’ve done my best to forget them, to rid myself of my own realities so that perhaps I can get outside them, perhaps far enough outside of them that I don’t think of them any more.  I stopped talking almost completely to both N and K, and was chatting on and off with V, a woman I’d never met, never done more than chat with online, but whom I’d seen and admired via the internet for quite sometime.   And then I met T.  T works online too.  T’s amazing, though I don’t know why.  She’s the exact opposite of what I thought I was looking for: tall (she’s not), blond (she’s brunette), sweetly innocent (this she is wickedly not), and close at hand (wrong country).  So, it looks like I’m going about this dating thing in the completely the opposite manner than I should be.  Or the opposite manner that I should.  Maybe I’m just tired of the “If at first you don’t succeed” schtick, or perhaps I’ve finally learned the valuable unstated lesson, “try a different way”.  I don’t know if I’m working smarter; I’m certainly working harder.  Perhaps I’m just giving in to my basis for one-sided relationship, loving the fantasy, failing the reality.  Still, 2500 miles is a lot closer than I was to N when I was in Iraq, and seems a lot closer than I am now, flying crows aside.   And T, who’s something of a personality of her own, brought me back to something I’ve been trying to address in my second novel.  What is self?  Because there is no one self, but shouldn’t there be?  The first, most obvious self, is who we all think we are.  That’s the easy one, or is it?  Because I don’t think that you can ever get to know someone else’s first self.  You only get to know the second self, the self that you perceive of them.  And that self is always biased in some way.  The second self is the bridge between the first self and the fantasy self.  The fantasy self is the one wholly invented out of circumstance concerning an individual, it’s what you think you know based on what you’re presented with, not what you’ve gleaned from interaction like the second self, not what the person knows about them, like the first self.   Selfs, they act like conjugated words in that manner.  The drift between first, second, and third person, and yet, just like in another language, it is a faux pas that creates confusion when selfs are interchanged.  Heaven forbid I speak about the first self from knowledge that I’ve invented about the fantasy self.   That’s Johnny Star’s problem, no one knows his first self, even he’s lost it.  Is that what I’m afraid of?  That’s what happened to Emory.  That’s what David Verity is struggling with in  Fleeting  my still unfinished existential screenplay, that’s what everyone wants to know about John in  The Good Life .  All of my protagonists are struggling with their first self.  What does that say about the writer?  I’m the writer.  What does that say about me? And here’s the kicker, here’s the one that hurts.  Is our first self even stable?  What happens when our first self starts to become our second self, what happens when we start to change because of the interactions that we endure and explore when formulating the second selfs of others?

      	Today seemed to be one of those cleverly disguised, yet productive days.  I woke up this morning wanting to quit, to just drop out of the human race, at least for a while.  I didn’t want to exercise, didn’t want to get dressed in green and go to work, didn’t want to sit around the office, didn’t want to come back and sit around my room.  All I really wanted to do was sleep.  As of yet, I’ve not been able to do that.  True enough it’s only a little after 1030 in Texas, but it might as well be forever.  But while I didn’t do what I set out to do today, I did do what I hadn’t planned on, but had in the back of mind wanted to.   	First off, I finished reading a book.  I don’t know why, it’s always bittersweet, but I enjoy doing it.  I end up missing the very thing that I had put so much time into doing, the goal I’d been marching forever towards but did not want to achieve.  It’s like climbing a diving board with the intent of jumping off, because you have to know what the fall will be like, but standing at the edge and thinking about not jumping.  After all, you’ve come all this way, but isn’t the view just splendid where you are?  And, I finally got off my ass and picked up a router, so both my work computer and my play computer are connected the internet now.  And I did a little writing, not on the book that I’m trying to turn into my second novel, but instead on an online novella that I’ve been working on, drudging up characters, places, events from years past, if only to sate some sort of nostalgia within myself, if only to sate the requests of other writer friends, perhaps because I respect them.  I watched a movie; I had a few drinks, I was finally formally introduced to the girl a friend of mine up and married (it really seemed like  a whim, he did it the day after his twenty-first birthday, only knowing her for a month or so I’m told), I chatted with a buddy of mine whom I haven’t really talked to in a few years, I chatted with another who’s getting ready to go off to Iraq.  And all in all, it’s felt good.  It’s odd, for me, a writer, one who constantly plunges himself into darkness, if only to stare into the tainted carnival mirror of the soul, the one that shows every flaw magnified, to be getting ready for bed oddly satisfied after only accomplishing a few simple tasks. But I am, and so I’m going to keep this short tonight.  No mention of K.  No mention of N.  And no mention of V.  Who’s V, why, you’ll just have to wait on that, won’t you?

      It’s seven thirty and the sun is still up.  I’m weighed down by something Al Pacino said, “As soon as I get out…the pull me back in.”  He might as well have been talking about me.  Today was a fight not to show up at work, my unit readying itself for QRF (Quick Reactionary Force) and tasks are coming down the pipeline as fast as they can be dreamed up.  The eyes of my subordinates keep turning to me, and if they can’t see me they leave voice messages on my cell phone.  My leash.  I’m getting tugged around, just trying to keep my head down and out of the line of fire.  The old maxim, you can’t shoot what you can’t see is one that I’m doing my best to abide by.  I’ve been slipping around like a spy, trying to keep my profile as low as possible, trying to be seen by as few as possible.  I’ve been using shady tactics.  You don’t get in my door during the work day unless you call from the threshold, and you don’t get me on the phone unless you pass the caller ID test.  And it’s not that I’m scared, no, I’m stacking the deck because I know I’m not needed.  And I don’t want to be needed.  I can’t help, I’m too far out the door, it’s not just one foot that’s out, oh no, it’s one foot that’s left in.   This late in the game, and I need a jet plane.  I need an escape.  Cut the scene and turn the page and start me with a header that reads Ext. Day. Greenwich Village. Start with the action block that reads:  As the sunshine streams down MacDougal street, Brad is seated outside of Café Regio, the green over hang proclaiming it the birthplace of cappuccino.  He’s drinking coffee though, and he’s drinking it black despite the fact that locals and tourists alike are strolling about in various methods of the khaki shorts that are in fashion this hot summer day.  A cigarette burns between drags in the white recesses of an ashtray, and when he’s not smoking or sipping idly at the coffee, he’s scribbling idly descriptions of passers-by in a notebook with a silver fountain pen.  And following those descriptions are stories, dallyings in the fantasy selfs of people that might never see themselves as he’s watching them, might not go home to the significant other that he paints for them.    Of course the news broke yesterday, roughly six thousand troops called up, men and women who just two days ago believed in their hearts of hearts that they were out.  They were done.  Now, they’re all holding their breath and watching the phone.  How many of them saw both the Tigris and the Euphrates?  How many of them know they can pull the trigger, know that hesitation is the real killer, that the men that they are fighting are just that men, but damn it, if you’ve got to pull the trigger, then obviously you’re pulling it for a reason.  How many of them never want to be put in that position again?    A glass of absinthe down, and the tangent isn’t stopping.  August and Everything After, the song, not the album which bears its name but in which it doesn’t appear, is on repeat on the stereo.  My cigarettes are smoking themselves.  “I hope you don’t expect me to be crucified.  The best that they can hope to do is hang me from the nearest tree.”  Well, find the tree, but while you’re looking for it, you might as well be looking for me.  I should be working on my book, or running through the edits on my screenplay, or redrafting another screenplay.  I should be on the phone with my agent, wondering what’s going on with my first novel.  I shouldn’t be unwinding after a day of close calls and sudden excuses.    And the horrible thing.  I’m quite certain that if called on, I’ll go back to Iraq.  One more time.  Because I’ve never run before, not from something like this.  All I want to do is disappear, but it’s the things we do that we don’t want that really define us.  This song, August and Everything After, I got into Iraq in the last week of July.  I started setting out on the road, started getting shot at in August.  And now August and Everything After has sought to define me.  It was in August, near the end, that I started writing my novel, my first real masterpiece.  I wanted it to be grand.  It was a way for me to live a life that I couldn’t see, couldn’t touch, could only dream about.  But when I wrote about it, I might as well have been there, that might as well have been me.  I don’t know which one was me, but I was there, in the bar with them, and I was there as they sat back and sought refuge in absinthe, in cigarettes, in ideals that they couldn’t touch but reached for any way.  And I tired to explain what I was doing, I tried to put my protagonist in the same spot.  I had him write a book, and I had him live his life through that book.  Why?  Because misery loves company.  Because I was at a point where I had to shut everything off, where I had to be so strong that emotion was a luxury I had to strip myself of.  And if I’d told myself that at the time, it would have seemed like I was making a big deal out of nothing, but I remember when it peaked, I remember riding in the back of a five ton truck, and I wanted so badly to make it back to the FOB where the illusion of safety at least existed, and I was leaning over the rails that ran along the bed of the truck, and I had my weapon, my M-16 aimed at oncoming traffic and I was counting my shots before I took them.  I’d look at the drivers of oncoming traffic, men just going somewhere, men with out malicious intent, and I gave those men a mental ultimatum, you can do this and only this and you’ll live.  Keep driving.  Don’t look at me.  Don’t reach for anything.  Don’t swerve.  I’m putting my first shot into your chest.  I’m going to bury my second in the block of your engine, saw it in a movie and hell it just might work.  The third I’m going to put in your front left tire so your car fishtails and stops.  I’ll be out of this truck by then, and I’ll come over to your car, and I’ll pull anyone left out.  And then I’ll inform you that you failed your test.  That was it, that was the bottom.  After that I started to relax on the gun.  After that, I realized I’d gone and stared into the darkest portion of the human.  Call it a heart, call it a soul, call it a mind, call it whatever the hell you want.  I stared into it, and allowed it to wrap its arms around me for one day.  After that, I found the war rhythm, the system you develop when you spend enough time out of the wire.  You learn how to spot what’s wrong, what doesn’t belong, you learn that there’s a pattern in everything, it might not be mathematical, because it’s a whole lot simpler than that.  It’s easier than two plus two.  It just is.    I have to get off this combat kick.  I’m almost out.  And as soon as I start to get out, they drag me back in.  I need to work tonight.  I didn’t work last night.  I’m not sure if I worked the night before, but the fact that I was sober leads me to believe that I didn’t.  I don’t know.  I need to work.  Why?  Because I’ve got too many questions right now, and work solves that for me.  I need to get out.  I’ve got so few days left in uniform that it’s almost funny.  So close, freedom is there.   I'm certain because I want to know if I can walk away from that blackness one more time.

      So it seems that Paul Bremmer and I are flying on the same relative high today.  A long trek is near completion for me, and seemingly over for him.  Those of us in the States woke up to the news that the transition of authority in Iraq has finally been returned to the Iraqi people.  Having been a member of an occupying force, not a label I look upon with any truly positive sentiment, I am thrilled to see that Iraq is once again a sovereign nation.  I know that wishing the Iraqi people the best of luck means nothing, and will never get there, but I do have quite a few Iraqi friends, and I wish them all the chances for success that life could possibly afford.  I’ve gone and uploaded a picture of one of them, Ahmed, whom was both friend and family when I was in Iraq.  As far as my day is concerned, while my level of freedom doesn’t come close to rivaling that of the Iraqi people, they hold a high emotional impact on my world.  Today I officially started clearing, that is performing the necessary tasks to get myself out of the Army.  And I’ve got the papers to prove it.  It’s a glorious release at this point, the honeymoon, something five years in the making, a hair over a fifth of my life, and an end of the first stage of my adulthood.   Being that my parents split when I was eleven, I had to nearly raise myself.  I left high school and seemed to take off my graduation robe merely to put on Army greens.  I’ve seen a lot while in the military, or so I’m told.  I’ve been afforded chances that the vast majority of my colleges couldn’t hope for, and I like to believe that I’ve made the most out of what I’ve been given.  Here’s the part where I’m supposed to feel obliged to return the favor, to give the Army more time, to balance out the goods.  But the bads have already done that, the times spent sleeping in ditches, on the sides of mountains, dropping off the grid for weeks or months at a time.  The crippling affect that the Army has on relationships, when paired with my own, has made the time a very lonely, very long one.  The bonds that the Army forges between soldiers are the deepest I’ve ever felt, and they are very deep, but they don’t compare to the loving touch of a woman, someone who can understand without words, can find answers to questions not asked.  I’m not saying I’m getting out to meet women, but I am saying that despite the relationships I’ve carried over the last few years, none have felt the depth or lasted the length that I’d like.  Many only lasted a single night.   After the next two weeks, I’ll be living life on my own terms for the first time.  The safety net of parents and the support of fellow soldiers will be gone.  And for now I welcome that danger by counting down little things, the amount of formations I’ll have to go to, the number of times I’ll have to put a uniform on again.  True, the notion is probably naive, one could easily argue that the clothes that we all wear is the uniform of our particular trade, that showing up for work is the same as holding a formation, but I’m more than willing, I’m driven to find out for myself.

      So, being that I'm so close to getting out of the Army, I decided I'd better call up my business partner and make sure we were still on, being that he should be back in NY by now, as he'd turned his cell phone off sometime when he was in LA.  Well, seems he's off and flown to Jordan, visiting family or friends.   And the thing that worries me about this is, we're supposed to move to LA in less than a month.  I guess these are the things that make life fun...

      I woke up today to the sound of rain.  Feeling both sore and broken, I chose to just stay in bed.  After all, the rain at least sounded cold.  The rain stopped and I woke up, having a mere eleven dollars in my wallet, just a few cents under twenty in the bank, and the other couple of thousand tied up in stocks, I needed to go to the store.  I’d slept through both breakfast and lunch.  I needed food, I needed a soda, I needed cigarettes.  I’ve yet to make it to the store, but I did get an email from a new friend, a young lady named Alex who lives in Georgia.  It’s always nice to meet new people, after all, since I’m not a terrific fan of pornography, I’ve got to use the internet for something.   Dan and Tony, the guy formerly known as ‘Cherry’, stopped by; Tony brought food.  And I discovered much to my delight that Seven Mary Three had released a new album last month.  It’s their first since early 2001.  I found it on accident, screwing around on a  urlLink Russian MP3 site  –  and picked it up for a mere $.51.  Of course, I plan on buying the physical disc, my collection wouldn’t be complete without, and I do what I can to support the artist that I really like.  But that’s not the point, the point is the lyrics are fantastic ( urlLink lyrics ).  They strike nerves in a very direct and personal way, a great deal so more than any other album that Seven Mary Three has ever released.  If a band is going to start a comeback, than elevating themselves above earlier benchmarks is a damn fine way to do so.    After staying sober last night, watching a movie and going to bed early, only to sleep in today, I think it’s time that I get back to working on my novel.  I’m roughly 20% through it, and having a good time working on it.  It’s different than my first, and I think the way that it deals with the world of Pop Culture might actually help it to sell.  Not that I’m worried about the money, rather I want people to hear what I have to say, maybe someone’ll get something out of it.

      It’s just after 2:30 in the morning and I’m alone.  Sounds like a lament for a warmer bed, about 98.6 degrees warmer, or if you could see me now, a lament to simply be in bed.  But I just woke up and I’m one floor down, almost directly below my best as best as my hack navigation can place me.  I’m hesitant to say that this is my last 24 hour duty to ever be performed for the Army, because that would be testing fate a bit more than I’d like.  I remember naming this or that as being my last ever in Iraq and watching as the entire world seemed to work itself around, changing things so that I could continue to doing the most mundane of details over there when all I wanted was to get back to Texas, a statement I never believed I’d hear myself make.  But, I am a mere six hours now from finishing this shift, not that I spent much time at the desk today.  I started off this morning early, attempting to track down my medical records, which was a success though the third, and lowest ranking person was the one who eventually found them.  I then disappeared half way across garrison in order to get poked and prodded, to urinate in a cup, to have nearly silent beeps played in my ears in order to test my hearing, and then to walk all the way back.  I could have called for a ride, but who was I kidding?  I didn’t want to be at this desk anymore then than I do now.  Getting back, I was glad to find out I had duty, why?  Because things got a bit too stupid a bit too fast as they always seem to do in garrison work.  People were working throughout the course of the overly long day, moving things here and there, shuffling paperwork, trying to get things ready for our newly arrived battalion commander to come through the barracks. Ah, our new battalion commander, the guy who had a rain storm on his parade, quite literally, and quite fierce, on Tuesday.  The guy who’s already had me soaked to the bone once, not something I’ll do easily for a person – I rank being cold and wet right up there along with being exposed to nerve agents.  Frankly, I’d rather get shot at.  But that’s another story.  Our new battalion commander maintained the standard army line, the typical leader spouted recruitment story, and it was given in a briefing that ironically, was telling us how good we have it while cutting into our lunch hour.  And here’s the thing, don’t tell me how good I have it here, how well the Army treats me compared to say American corporations, don’t tell me how difficult and expensive it is to be a civilian, because out of 250 million Americans, only about three million or so are dependent on the military for support, the rest seem to be doing just fine.  Now, chances are those other Americans are no smarter, and no more adept at overcoming adversity than I am.  In fact, between growing up poor and these last five years in the Army, I’ve gotten quite good at overcoming adversity and doing without.  I’m an old pro at it.  I’ve got calluses and scars from it.  It insults me to be told, in between the lines, that without the Army I am nothing. And then there was the new bit, a rumor that’s been going on and around the Army for a few months now, since units were starting to face their second rotation in either of the American Military centers of interest, and one that the most minimal of research will debunk: that the Inactive Ready Reserves (IRR) are being called up.  IRR is something than any non-career soldier faces, it’s part of being in an all volunteer army.  Everyone who enlists in the Army signs up for an eight year contract regardless of how long they are on active duty.  Their active portion, in my case a very long five years, is subtracted from that eight and is largely considered their duty, while the rest is spent on IRR, for all extensive purposes, being a civilian.  Four times since September 11th, 2001 various people have been called up from IRR to fulfill what is called ‘Needs of the Army’ assignment.  These positions are normally ones that require special skills, such as language fluency or technological knowledge, relative experts (for the majority of the skills in the Army are considered expert on a severely relative basis) which are more quickly utilized than soldiers fresh out of training.   The last time that a major recall of IRR soldiers was instituted was for Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm, in 1991.   Unfortunately, and disgracefully, Army recruiting has been circulating a memo, claimed to be bogus by the Army Human Resources Command (HRC) as well as the Public Affairs Office (PAO) of the Army National Guard.  The memo states that the Army has ratified the recall of close to thirty thousand IRR soldiers, nearly one in four, outlining both a system for recall, and severe measures for dealing with the former soldiers who fail to report for activation.  This memo has been used as a scare tactic to get soldiers to enlist in either the active Army, the Army Reserves, or the Army National Guard, nearly a thousand coming off of IRR under the pretense it’s better to chose than to be chosen.  The reasoning given in my own unit, and quite an illogical logic at that, was that it’s better to join a Reserve or National Guard unit, where you can serve with quality soldiers and bond with them prior to going to deployment than to be placed in one, in which “the soldiers you are serving with will be forty to fifty years old”.  Now, here’s where that logic fails – soldiers called up from IRR are placed into the same units that soldiers volunteering to reactivate join, the same units that civilians initially enlisting for service in the Reserves or National Guard are members of, and the same units we are so lucky to choose should we agree to enlist Reserve or National Guard upon completion of our present Active Duty contracts.  The problem is that there is no mythical unit composed of only the elderly and the inept; there is no ‘special’ unit to punish soldiers who are activated from IRR.  They are all units, and to treat them without prior knowledge as either good because you chose them or inept so they should be viewed as a threat is just poor rhetoric, a laughable debate.  Here’s another way to look at it – join the Reserves or the National Guard and face a relatively strong chance of redeploying, or join the IRR and face at present a 1 in 4 chance of merely being activated.  I think of my self as a pretty good card player, a rather risky gambler, but a 1 in 4 is not going to get my money.  No thanks, Colonel, I’ll take my risks with the IRR.   And the problem isn’t that I refuse to go back to Iraq.  The problem is that I do want to have my own life.  I have goals.  I have dreams.  I don’t have plans – frankly I’ve learned that every step of a plan is just another instance for the unforeseen to happen – but I do have places to be. Sometimes it’s hard, having been in Iraq, having seen first hand both the good and the bad, to sit back and watch the media focus merely on the negatives – four killed today, eight injured yesterday, roadside bomb, ambush, prisoners being so inhumanely mistreated.  It’s hard to watch these not because they are untrue, these things all did happen, but because the other side of the story never sees the light in the only country that supports the men on the ground if not the mission: the very same country that we all wanted so very much to return to.  The media never mentions children returning to school, beaming and beautiful in their new school clothes, the rebuilding of a nation’s infrastructure after thirty years of a being crippled by a despot, finally seeing the medicine that was never seen during the sanctioned ‘Oil for Food’ program.  They never show soldiers playing soccer (football) with Iraqi children.  They never show the elections.  They never mention that the dinar, essentially worthless a year ago, is now on par with the Italian lire.  Granted, yes, there is combat over there, but it is difficult to have foreign soldiers in your country, I know the US wouldn’t stand for it.  I know that northern Ireland still isn’t standing for it.  I know that the majority of the Iraqis (and foreigners who flood through the Iraqi border primarily from Iran and Syria) who have picked up arms are essentially the same person I was when I joined the Army five years ago – a young man who merely wanted to find his place in the world, his trial by fire, to stick up for something he believes in, to want to believe in something, to perhaps find out if there was such thing as an honorable death.  To be true, the amount of people acting as insurgents are far less than 1%, no where near a majority in a country that is a burgeoning democracy, but thanks to the attention of the international media, thanks to sensationalism selling, those 1% are seen as the majority, if only because they yell so much louder than those who simply wake up everyday and do their best to provide for their families, to go to school, to try and better themselves and their nation.   And here comes the horror of getting what you wished for.  I honestly hope that the majority of the Iraqi people never see just how vocal and violent that 1% can be, but do not ask me to return to Iraq.  I did my best in the nine months that I was there.  I risked my neck numerous times.  Twice I heard that I had died, thank goodness that news never reached my mother.  I went through the heart break and tears once already, I saw the relief when I returned with all my parts and pieces.  I heard my mother’s voice crack with joy when I told her I should be out of the Army within three weeks of publishing this, as opposed to six as I originally informed her.  I love my family, and I love my country, but I spent the better part of a year trying to help a nation, while the rest of the world is content to listen to 1%.  So, I’ll take my chances on IRR, and I’ll pretend that the threat of recall is nonexistent, and if my nation wants me to go back to Iraq, I’ll deal with that bridge then.  But not now, I have my own goals and dreams to live for now.

      Dragging myself away from the trend I've been in lately, not meaning that I'm sober (but I am, though it's not my point).  This post is more of an attempt to bring life back into perspective.  I'm still doing my best to get out of the Army, at least at heart, and I still haven't barely done anything.  I've got my Phase 1 physical in the morning, but that is dependent on my find who exactly has my medical records, see, they're not at the TMC where they should be, and the nice lady at the TMC said they should be at my aide station, but when I showed up there, everyone from my unit was off work, and so I was forced to rely on a medic from another unit to try and find them, to which he tried and failed.  With the ease with which information is found on the internet, I was left wishing that the aide station had a built in search engine, a few clicks of a computer and I'd know exactly where the hard copy was.  Okay, maybe I shouldn't post sober. Or maybe if I'm posting sober, I should only do so while sleep deprived - which I'll be tomorrow, the last time that the Army can make me miss sleep, because I'm not on the schedule for the remainder of my time in the Army.  Yeah, that's cause enough for celebration there.   But, aside from trying to get out of the Army, I've got the first 4 chapters of my new novel done.  Were I a braver soul, I'd start sending those first three out with a query to agents and publishers, see if I can't beat  A Life Sentence  to press.  But I'm not.  I've been working fantastically lately, do to a ready supply of booze and cigarettes and an even greater source of strife between T and getting out of the Army.   In less tragically hectic news, I'm now on  urlLink Orkut , and feel that I've caught the tail end of the beta phase, when all the originals are phasing themselves out, conversations are mostly at a standstill, and the floodgates will open up once the beta is finished and the actual product meets the public. And talk about betas, I can honestly say, and likewise be embarrased about the successful flight of  urlLink SpaceShipOne .  Here come's the Second Space Age.  True, we're right on that Fight Club path to the Microsoft Galaxy and Planet Denny's (you have to have read the book the catch the last one).  But hopefully the privatization of space will lead to enhanced speed for those things that people have grown up reading about for so long they almost seem antique, like colonies on Mars and harvesting asteriods.  Or maybe I'm bored with this planet.  Or maybe I'm just bored with Texas. But that's life, down to nearly the minute.

      Well, how about that, two bridges burned in the same evening.  I am the man when it comes to destroying my own relationships, no one can screw things up faster than I can.  And now, barely dressed and looking like the world’s done its best to kick the hell out of me, I light a cigarette and actually ask the mirror, why am I in such a good mood?  Okay, a bit of backtrack.  I was talking to an old friend yesterday, I was drunk and she’s recently married, pregnant, and honest.  Which was a good thing, I’d been screwing around on the net, building up steam and knocking out new portions of my novel between drinks and entertaining the various vagabonds and their own varied states of inebriation that came through my door.  Things just get wild when I open my bar.  And up from out of the blue, popped up a message from K.  And we lit into each other, the proverbial gloves were off.  I was tired of dealing with her and since a civil conversation was no where to be had, a most uncivil one was launched into.  And she got fed up and left only to come back a while later.  And by the time she’d gotten completely fed up with me, she said good night and I said good bye, informing her in the process that this was in fact good bye and I wasn’t going to humor any further attempts at anything what so ever.  Great, bridge one down.  And then in between drinking further, for I was not by any means holding back, and waiting for my pizza to get there, I decided that I was finally going to tell T what was going on.   I have this horrible habit of being able to recognize patterns.  It helps in cards and hurts in most other relationships.  Find the pattern, follow it beyond where it is, and it takes a lot of the surprises out of life.  And with T an amazing pattern had shown up.  Before I went on vacation we were like fifteen year olds, I knew exactly when she’d be online, and we’d talk for ages.  We’d do the childish ‘so hard to say goodbye’ bits, and late at night when I should have been sleeping, in the wee hours before I had to get up and be at work, I’d wait for her to get out of work and we’d message some more.  It was like clockwork.  Afterwards, the conversations were reduced to rare and scant, little went either way, and the sense of ease and novelty was replaced by a tired and trying cycle.   And it’s probably a bad idea for me to get so hung up on this rapid loss, but I’m quickly approaching a crossroads in my life, where in the next few months I could realistically be anywhere, doing anything, plans are easily scrapped and consequences are thrown to the wind before they are ever even realized.  But at my age, it’s time to carve something out, and I’ve got my knife and I’m looking to get digging.   So, in a drunken sense of reality, I jumped online, slipped over to T’s work, and I drenched the bridge in as many flammable liquids as I could, or so I fear, and I tossed a match onto it.  And I stood there on that bridge as the flames leapt up, as T tried to convince me that she thought I was an awesome person, and I just wanted to know where things went wrong, where I screwed up, not so much for her, but for any future relationship that I might embark on.  And then as my expensive private chat wore out, and I was too tired, or perhaps to considerate to bring up private matters in public chat, I took my leave and went to go pass out.   Sleep wasn’t much of a rest.  I crashed before ten, but woke up nearly hourly, hung-over already, to drink water, too fast and too cold, and too likely to make me puke.  But I drank and I lay back down, and I’d fall asleep only to wake back up and do it again.  That went on until sometime around three, where I completed the cycle one last time and then went back to sleep until sometime early this morning when the sun was up and the most annoying birds Texas can muster (and it’s a big state with a lot of birds to muster from) woke me.  I fought with sleep, but it wasn’t coming, my room was too hot and smelled too heavily of scotch and cigarette ash.  My dreams didn’t help, but they seldom do when hung-over.  I remember writing a book in one of them, and using that book as a suicide note.  I remember remarking in my sleep, to myself or no one in particular, that it was short, at only 50k words.  But it was all I could come up with.  And that brings me up to speed, with my room silently rocking out to soft music and the lights low and cave-like, and the air conditioner still broken and urging me to stay still less I move and generate heat.  So, why am I in a good mood?  Hell if I know.

      I rolled out of bed today and into a bottle.  My bar is stocked and it seems I’m doing my best to fix that.  I don’t know why, I guess I’ve just been racked by regrets recently and drinking, well, at least when I’m drinking my mind doesn’t stop me from fighting them.  I open myself up and I allow myself to feel, instead of hiding behind the walls that I’ve done so well to build for myself.  It’s funny, back in high school, those years ago, I used to rely on girls for this, to drag me out, but then, back then, I had to be social.  Now, well, that’s one of the perks of being an adult I guess, I can hide in my room, and have cigarettes and absinthe for breakfast.  I can live my life in laps from computer to bed and back to computer.  Not that it’s much of a life, but well, I’ve got a pulse.  Sometimes I worry that I’m walking down the same path as Emory did.  Yet, I put my hopes on Los Angeles and a life the hopefully awaits me there.  I am a living embodiment of procrastination.  I’ll start to live soon, but for now I’m going to clench in my elbows and protect myself from the punches that life is sure to throw at me.  I’ve been weathering a storm for so long now that I’m not even sure if it’s raining anymore.  Pain has become an abstract thought, something discussed at cafes, much like meaning.  It’s been so long since I felt it, so long since I’ve come close to feeling anything, that it’s all metaphysical now, isn’t it?  I’m wandering around in this world of smoke and mirrors that I’ve spent my entire life meticulously constructing and just hoping that somewhere out there, I can mean something to somebody who means something to me.  I tell myself that I’m a null tempest, a term I came up with, a force, a storm, sudden and violent and passionate, waiting to change someone else’s life, but I don’t know who that someone is, and so I’m null, I’m a tempest waiting to happen. But here’s the real problem.  I think I’m too good at being alone.  I’ve gone and streamlined my life, made all the necessary changes myself and now saved someone else the trouble of having to do it themselves.  I think I’ve gone and made myself so complete that no one else feels like they have a place in my world. And I’ve gone and caved again.  I just talked to T.  It was a mistake, something I shouldn’t have done, especially considering I’ve been awake for 48 minutes and drinking for 43 of them.  I can’t help it, I want to talk to her, I want to mean something to her, because somehow she was in the right place at the right time, or wrong and wrong depending on how you look at it, and she means something to me.  Again, I’m a null tempest.  I’m waiting, waiting to mean something.  And so I guess I’ll just keep writing until I do.

      Today I was gripped with an inexplicable anger.  I was raging, raging against my world, raging against the rules, raging against some sense of perceived wrong doing.  This rage manifest into a poem:   Doomsday Weather Report   The specific gravity of anger  Combined today With the depression of listlessness, To plunge an entire world Into a tailspin. Wind gusts are expected, To reach all time highs, 9.8m/s^2 and falling. And reports of lightening Setting fires to carefully lain Hopes and Dreams have been  Reported somewhere in the West. A state of emergency has been announced But the National Guard are all somewhere else. It seems that everyone is truly on their own. And now here’s Steve with Sports.  And as the day officially wrapped up, as far as the paying job was concerned, I was greeted with a bottle of absinthe.  Drinking was all I wanted to do.  I wanted to get completely hammered, to forget about the week, about the future, about the present, and about the recent past.  I wanted to get drunk and lost in the non-moment, and absinthe seemed an excellent means to that very destructive end.  I wanted that self-destruction, I still do, despite all the things that I need to accomplish, despite others accepting my dreams, despite the fact that my agent has finally started to send my hard-wrought manuscript out to publishers, despite being so close to being out, despite the ending of this one very long chapter.  I wanted to destroy.  In the words of Fight Club – I wanted to put a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldn’t screw to save its species.  And so, with absinthe in my glass, as cold as possible in order to fight the fact that my air conditioner has decided to not be friends, I put in a movie.  And during that movie, and after several glass of la fae verte, I knocked out two more poems.   Unrequited   There was a nearly naked form, A woman standing at my window. And my bed was still warm, But all I could do was smoke. I couldn’t see her face, She wouldn’t look at me. Shadows did their best To obscure even the colour of her hair. And her name remains forever On the tip of my tongue.  (18 June 2004)   Null Tempest   The best relationships Are a tragedy in duality. I long to believe That I am a null tempest: A storm waiting to brew In the heart of another, In the life of another. I want to be a muse. I want to be an addiction. I want to be the storm- That force that inspires another 	To just be alive. But I’m not, not now. As for now, I’m just nothing. As for now, I’m just null.  (18 June 2004)  I’ve become transfixed on leaving.  In Italy, on the shores of Lake Como, there is a tiny seaport town called Bellagio.  It’s become my unreachable destination, a hidden, secret point to run to, to jettison the rest of the world and just call my home.  It’s featured in my new novel, featured  A Ballad for Johnny Star , and it’s one stop along Johnny’s quest.  And I once again, am aligning myself with my protagonist.  Despite being in the States, I’m continuing to live ostensibly through my writing.  Maybe one day I’ll learn to live by means other than a pen or keyboard.

      It took a great deal of strength to not post yesterday.  I know that I have a bad habit of posting very dark things when I'm on CQ, and shift yesterday was perhaps the most boring CQ shift of the past five years, somehow I did it.  Perhaps it was because that my runner, a guy who had the same rank as me, was actually interesting to talk to, or perhaps it was because I, for once in my life, didn't want to embrace the darkness.  Perhaps I'm just tired of it, but I just got off the phone with T, yes, that's right, a phone call for the first time since I left Canada.  I called her at work, and talked beyond what we should have (I can't help being a bad influence, I'm good at it) and it felt really good.  I'm supposed to call her again tomorrow, she said it was fine to call her at home, something I'd been contemplating doing for a while now.  And our conversatoin, however brief, left me in a good mood.  Pair that with being a under a month left in the Army and I'm in a surprisingly good mood. My nomadic tendancies have been kicking me harsh recently.  I'm ready to go, wanting to do so right this very minute, to just skip the next four weeks, to just get this over and done with and get on to the next chapter of my life, for this damn life is unrolling like a novel.  I want to skip the mundane and just get to the meat of the issue.  I mean, who really cares about the situations I have to go through, the medical tests and the return to the issue points, the turning in of gear and the filing of paperwork.  I don't.  I just want to be out, to be somewhere new, and to do things that pertain to my life in general, as opposed to my life in specific.  I want to move on. It's a left over from growing up.  When I was a kid, I never spent more than three years in one spot, not since I was six years old.  I was always moving, and by the time things might have gotten both heavy and mundane (an oxymoron to be certain) I was packing up my room and getting ready to move on again.  And that luxury, although at the time it wasn't one, is one that I'm hard pressed to let go of.  Now, I'm ready to move on again, and I don't want to deal with the mundane processes of endings and begginings.   But, T is still amazing, and my novel is right at the 14k mark, and and I'm feeling good.  I'm feeling good.  Take that darkness.

      I'm such a fool.  It was her, not me.  She was having a tough time and I, egotistically, believed I was the source.  We talked.  I'm hoping we'll keep talking.  She should be off work soon, home and on the internet.  I only pray she never sees these posts.  Who knows?  I pulled a 'High Fidelity' the fear of commitment, always leaving one foot out the door, always ready to move to that next fantasy.  I named my philosophy, it's called 'Interpretationism' because everything we see, we interpret.  And, man, I blew this one.  I'm doing my best to recover, to retain T.  Why?  I still have that feeling - you know the one - the one where the pain comes from.

      So, I've always worked best when I'm dark, and for the past few years, Iraq aside (where working was the only means I had of pretending I was alive) I haven't been dark.  And I've been getting better, at writing, not at being dark.  Oh, I've been anything but dark.  I remember once when I was in high school, a girl named Cindy, who I wanted to screw more than anything because she was a) cute, and b) so unable to read, I mean, could a personal really be that one dimensional?  Well, this broad, Cindy, she once remarked, for someone as dark as I came off to be, I sure did smile a lot.  Well, the past few years have left me doing more of that smiling than being dark, and I've been filling my life with things, not really with meaning, but with things. And that brought me around to thinking, have I ever really been in love?  I mean, I'm writing a book about a pop star who can't sing love songs (his meal ticket) because he realized he's never been in love.  But, have I?  I mean, I've said the words, and I do my best not to say the words if I don't honestly feel them.  But, being that I'm currently single, and oh, so decidely so, I'm left to wonder.  Was it love?  Love's supposed to conquer all, right?  Well, if it was love, it didn't.  And at the time I always told myself that it was the world weighing in against love, and that love lost this time.  And it was always 'this time', and love was having a hell of a track record, losing here, losing there.  Always losing.   And, when I look back, the ones I really thought I loved where always the ones who rejected me.  Sarah.  Yeah, that's a whole bag of rocks I dumped into the proverbial river of life years ago, a pain buried so deep I can't tap into it even if I want to.  And Victoria, who aborted our baby, yeah, scabs abound there.  And digging in later revealed someone else, and so I brushed it off as an adequete excuse, a reason to not have to break up with me, a reason to fade off while reality existed outside the movie screen.  And N, that was a stillborn love, an E-love, to abuse the parlance of our times.  It was a connected love without any real connection, a love we seemed to both want, and a love the thawed like frost as soon as human touch was threatened.  Touch not even exist, only promise.  And T, the latest.  The crazy one, the one I never got to know.  Yeah, I'm on the outs.  Wasn't the poem evidence?  Monday night, technically Tuesday morning, when I thought she'd get online after work, when I thought she might lose sleep to talk to me - which she didn't not anymore.  And so I took a couple of days away from the net, away from the connections, to let myself stew, to let her permiate.  And I did, and she didn't.  I got online today, caught her there to.  And she didn't message me (yes, that's how poor our relationship has become, a sick game of who will message who first) so I took the hit, and I took the first step.  I'm usually willing to take the first step, and with T I took almost all of the first steps.  And the conversation was dead, absent.  There was nothing there.  It was small talk, carved up into bite-size portions, and served up with plenty of perservatives, so that no one would be offended in the thousand years it could sit there on the damn table.  Her responses, where once they had been almost excited and always curious, were droll and markedly uniterested.  The sense of disinterest was heavy, evident.  And so I went to shift my laundry, gone and away for merely 3 minutes, and when I came back she was gone, without so much as a goodbye, a 'hey, gotta run' a 'Talk to you tonight?'.  Nothing.  I got nothing.  And so I vented in a poem.  Not the most mature thing, but she'll never see it.  And I drank, which I'm very good at, not just reasonably good as I had told her, and I watched a movie because at least there, problems are resolved in two hours.  Fuck.  I flew to Vancouver to see her and we both walked away with completely different realities.  And so now, fuck it, I'm going to Tony's room to watch the MTV Movie Awards and dream about the certain string of nameless one-night stands I'm sure to now engage on, because that's how I work.

      Life Holds No Such Vindication  And further down the spiral I drift The sides have lost all shapes Direction is all gone And I yell at the top of my lungs  Screw it all  And all shall be screwed  I’ve become too old  To play such games; Become to callous  To force myself to care; I’m too young For my world to have ended this often;  And yet, with cigarettes and beer I mourn the passing, For this is the end of myself. It’s over, game over Game over. I set out to find out who I am So I could know what to expect And in the end I learned about others And I tried to close my eyes and laugh For you see, my timing was just a little too off.  Vindicated?  I’ll show you vindication. I am vindication. And I stared through that two way mirror  Thinking it was one And all I really wanted to see Was who I just may be.  I didn’t use to be this way But long ago I was. And all it took was time For this circle to swing around again, The hands of clock wash its face And from the face wash away the lessons Lessons of time that should have been learned And they’re unlearned now, aren’t they? We learned so much as we struggled to grow up That we forgot the things we held most dear When we were fifteen and in love. And now, and now, fuck now I’m done with now, I’ll just go to sleep I can waste twenty out of twenty four But it’s that last four that gets me The waking hours from oh,  The waking hour at four And its in those hour when the ghosts of the past They come out and they laugh. Because as I was growing up  I wasn’t growing smarter, I was just growing away And I was running, fuck yeah, I was running And where did I get?   Lost. And what did it get me? A few more scars, new ones to cover up the really deep ones, You know, the ones that really hurt. Well, they’re good and open now Bleeding just like the good old days Only now I’m much better at dying, I’ve got booze at my disposal Enough to fuel a rampage I just might not make it out from And then what? Who cares?  If I make it through I’ll deal with it then...  But I’m not planning, because I never plan And I certainly didn’t plan for this It was cold rejection, two little letters Not even the benefit of a sentence  And now, Fuck that, a good-bye, bleeding tear letter screwed me once And so, I won’t send it now. I’ll just stick my thumb in the hole in my heart And I’ll bite down on the filter of a Marlboro And I’ll lace my shoes up and I’ll keep going Further down this rapid spiral. So fast now that direction seems to be all at once And none at all.

      All I want to do is wash my face and go to sleep.  And I want to sleep forever, to just chuck it all and pat myself on the back and tell myself that I did good, that at least I gave it a shot.  This close to so many finish lines I’m always reminding myself that I am racked by anticipation of things that never quite seem to live up to my dreams.  I’ve been thought this so many times, so many chapters close and so many others opened, only to close them to close them again.  It’s a vicious cycle that is life, always climbing to find that over the top of this mountain another looms just up ahead, just over the horizon, just as tall as the one you just bleed your way up, and after a dozen mountains you start to think that maybe that valley, that promise land doesn’t really exist.   I’d like to blame this on the food poisoning, it would make a convenient scapegoat for feeling this horrible, but inside I’d know it isn’t true, I know that day in and day out this is not where I want to be.  I try to tell myself that there is somewhere I want to be, but late at night, when I’m awake and don’t want to be, when I’m not sleeping and I should, you can’t help but lose faith.  Adam Duritz said that faith is about believing without really getting, I’m going to challenge that, and say that faith is about believing when you don’t want to, faith is about trying to hold onto something when everything is telling you you’re grasping at shadows and ghosts.  It’s not just pulling duty tonight, all day and all night, it’s not just the horrible rumbling that is my stomach, it’s not just the toothache, it’s the combination of pain that we endure.  It’s not sleeping last night, it’s not knowing what I want, but knowing I am getting ain’t it.  It’s poor grammar, why? Because someone else said so.  The Rambler in Vancouver wanted to call his own shots, well damn it, so do I.  But the difference is, I think I’d be content calling my own shots and not involving others.  See, that’s my problem, I’m a commitment-phobic.  So I’ve been told by countless Exes, which I’m building quite the collection of.  I’ve got my own stable of failed relationships.  Not that they’re even the problem tonight, no, they’re as much the problem as my food poisoning.  The problem is that I only spread roots deep enough to leave a wound when I rip them up and move on, always another mountain, always another pass, never the valley, never the rest. I yelled down the hall at a friend tonight.  He said I need to talk to Tony about his drinking.  He said I drink too much as well.  I told him that I was tired of the rules, that I didn’t want to live to be old, that I wanted to burn out young and to know that I didn’t pass things up because someone else said I shouldn’t do them.  It was all so horribly immature, and it was all so horribly false.  ‘Cause here I am, following the rules just like everyone else, comma here, period there.  And why?  To what end?   I think the one thing I’d regret if I were to die right now, right this very moment, was that I never had a really lasting, deep relationship.  My lasting relationships all become shallow and petty, my deep relationships are never lasting.  And I came to realize it’s because I’m always expecting that next mountain, always looking for the next ridge.   I’d be content to sit outside tonight, it’s finally cooled off and that Texas wind, for I’ve realized that Texas is a very windy state, must have something to do with it being so level, that Texas wind and lack of light have helped to remove the crypt-like still heat from the desk.  Yes, I think I’d be content to sit outside for the remainder of my shift and smoke cigarettes non-stop, to punish my lungs for working, for following their rules.  But I know I’d run out of smokes within the first two hours.  Then I’d just pay the price until I could get more.  Then I’d pay the price until I could go to sleep.  I’d be stuck stumbling down the granite cliff face of one mountain and onto the base of the other. Every look up that mountain and just not want to climb anymore?  I picked up a mountain today.  It was the same mountain that I’d been lugging around since I got to New York.  It’s the script revisions for  A Yonker’s Sunset  and it’s a mountain I’ve stood at the base of for a week now, a mountain I’ve just stood at and looked up.  I don’t want to climb it, I need to, I said I would.  And I know that supposedly on the other side of this mountain is the valley, not  a  valley, but  the  valley.  The article is important there.  This is the script that’s taking me to California.  When I was in Lancaster, I found the paperwork from a school in Boston, Emerson, that I was looking at transferring to from West Point.  I was going to go from one school to another, so that I could get a certificate stating for all that I know what I’m talking about at least to the point where someone was willing to take my money and agree with me.  It’s funny.  I’ve never been to Boston.  I’ve called there a few times, but I’ve never been there.   I turned in my leave dates to my First Sergeant today.  Oh look, another mountain, where’d I put that valley again?  Hopefully he’ll do something about that, and I can start to slog up another mountain.  How many mountains can a man climb at one time?  Is life just one large mountain?  ‘Cause I’m climbing a half dozen at the moment and I’d like to know if its me or the rest of the world that’s just off kilter.    It’s lethargy that keeps us where we are.  In life it’s just easier not to change, not to move to another mountain.  We all know that the valley doesn’t exist, but we’ve all come so far up our particular mountain that we don’t want to admit we’re working towards nothing.  It’s the fear that we’ve been devoting ourselves to the wrong side all along, but I’m starting to think that there is no right side to this mountain, to any mountain.    It’s time for another cigarette.   There was a beetle at my foot So I crushed him And I crushed my cigarette too.   I woke up at 2:30 last night.  Just woke up.  No reason why, no reason to be awake.  But I had this damn poem I’ve never written going through my mind.  I didn’t write it down.  I told myself I’d do it in the morning.  And I can remember the gist of it, but the wording itself was gone when I woke up again, three hours later and 45 minutes prior to when I was supposed to.  And that wasn’t the food poisoning, I don’t think it was anyway.  I was expecting something, someone, and that something or someone wasn’t there.  It’s starting to sprinkle outside.  I used to like the rain, back when I was younger.  I could go and walk in the rain and people would just leave me alone.  I talked to my sister and we laughed at how we had wanted for so long to be adults.  Now we laugh at how foolish that was and to only be children again.  I recently commented that I apply a strict ‘scorched earth policy’ to my dating life.  I’ll burn that bridge before anyone else can come across it.  Perhaps it’s relevant, perhaps it’s I just wanted to write that down so it doesn’t go the way of that pre-dawn poem that never was.    And like Roger Waters penned in The Wall, “I feel one of my tunes coming on.”

      I'm pretty beat, long weekend, though I didn't do too much.  Drove all the way to Austin to see "The Saddest Music In The World" which was a good flick, despite it's criticism of America.  It wasn't as harsh as say, Dogville, and the direction was at least original, reminding me a great deal of the snowglobe from Citizen Kane and the Modest Mouse video for Float On all mixed up and jumbled together.   Finally talked to T tonight, though I caught her at work.  I sent her my Bunburying adventures as a single document, consdiering she was in there rather extensively, and I knew that this was risky.  Really, even though I was expressing my own opinion, my own mental process behind my vacation, it involves everyone, and I could have been encroaching.  Even though I think I painted her in a very adequete (and also in my opinion, truly beautiful light, but that's how I saw it) the risk was always there.  She could hate it.  She could not want to speak to me anymore.   She said it was really good.  She said it was wierd, good, but wierd, to read about herself.  I don't know.  I wanted her to know how I felt, and I didn't want to wax poetic about it.  I wanted the honesty, the truth.   I've learned that the more personal you are in your writing, the more people feel they can relate.  That's the interesting thing about people.  You never see anyone else thinking, never see anyone else feeling.  You might be going through a huge decision process, the same as the guy next to you, but you just see his decision, you never see his thought process.  The concept of other people thinking is foreign, it's a tremendous mystery.  And so, when we're given a window into that thought process, we grab onto it, latching in, identifying that, "Hey, I do that too!" and it's a bond, it's a link between your first self and an insight into the self of another. That's about all I got tonight.  I'm pulling a twenty four hour shift tomorrow, so there'll be more then.

      2 June 2004  	It was far too early for me to be awake.  It was far too early to be as awake as I was.  Three more flights to go, the scenic and self defeating version of air travel – Philly to Atlanta.  Atlanta to Dallas.  Dallas to Austin.  The horror inherent was that was three chances to get a really bad seat on a plane – the kind of seat that turns you off of air travel for quite some time.  My last two flights paired me first with a dog that was loose and within arm’s reach, the second sandwiched between infants to the front and rear.  But, even bad seating wasn’t as disturbing as returning to Texas.  Returning to the Army.  I’d gotten used to going, to always being just hours away from someplace new, if only new for the time being.   	Forty three.  The number bounded across my mind.  That was today’s magic number.  Sitting in Philly, I had forty three days until I was out, out of the Army, out on my own, and that magical day couldn’t come soon enough.  Though I already miss my Army friends, my battle buddies, the other poor bastards back from when life turned us all into poor bastard middle children – check my phone records.  Find the international phone calls – we talked even when I was out of the country, even when we’d just seen each other seven days prior.  And yet, I had to go, had to get out of the Army.  I had to go.  My mind was plagued with thoughts of Vancouver, of being able to turn my eyes left to the water and right to the mountains all while standing in a city.  I think I’ll go back, I tell myself I’ll go for a month.  I’ll rent a house and buy some liquor, I’ll go and write right there in the middle of all that scenery.  It must have been that people didn’t know where they wanted to live, couldn’t decide, so they kept walking, and they walked clear across Canada until they found the point where it all met; where earth, water, and wind all collapsed in on each other and the result wasn’t a fiery inferno, but rather a tumbling, scenic, symphonic situation where harmony abounds, yet only noise should honestly be heard.   	Oh, I didn’t want to get back to Texas, didn’t want this to be over.  Eight days wasn’t enough and who knows what could have been?  Who knows how much would have been enough?  I returned home to my family’s house.  It’s cozy, and it’s warm, and familiar, but it doesn’t feel like my home.  I never lived there, I don’t have a bed of my own, a room other than the guest room.  The majority of my possessions reside there in boxes as opposed to on shelves or in closets.  Digging through them I see my life as God must, with a every second lumped into a pile of its own.  Opening one box returns me to a different time, a different place, a wholly different view of the world.  Open another and I’m somewhere else all over again.   	I took a hack-saw to a steamer trunk.  The combination was lost and I had a feeling that there was some pretty important stuff inside.  Cutting the locking bracket was no problem, reminding me of the truth behind the phrase, ‘locks only keep an honest man honest.’  Two minutes and I was in, and that included going and finding a hack saw.  So much for a Masterlock.  I spent a good bit of time gathering up and sorting through my possessions.  I stumbled upon the angry music of my youth, the sad music of my young adult hood, and the few remaining movies that inflicted a profound level of this or that on my life at one point or another.  I performed a futile search for my now convincingly lost passport.  I made a mental note to get another one of those, grabbing my birth certificate so that I would be able to do so.  I grabbed my ACT scores as well, just in case college came knocking. 	The rest of the time I piddled.  I spent hours to trying to get my first truly expensive purchase, a computer I’d bought right after joining the Army, up and working again.  I tried to fix, tried to unbreak, all the damage and bugging that that poor Gateway had undergone since I gave it up to my sister and brother.  Three years of poor usage had take a severe toll on it.  After reaching an impasse there, only able to do so much, my hands could only work so many miracles, I sat down and read all of  Fight Club .  It is indeed very rare to find a book that I can read in one sitting, in one spell.   	Philly to Atlanta disappeared in a wink.  The two seats next to me were empty, and paired with the scant amount of sleep I’d gotten the night prior added up to a winning combination for killing three hours.  It wasn’t until I was en route to Dallas that the minor regrets started to crop up, I started to zone out contemplating the things that I could have said, or done, or wished at times that had passed me by.  Not healthy thoughts, but rather thoughts that were most certainly spurred on by returning to Texas.   	I had traveled so much recently that it almost felt like I didn’t know what the next stop was going to be like.  It didn’t feel like I was going back to the barracks, back to the room I’d tried so hard to make into a home.  Cozy.  Cozy.  I found the art I used to hang on my walls when I was at Fort Stewart when I was combing through the basement.  There were two family crests, each different, each mine, and a flight flier with pictures from the summer of 99, pictures of me, a rare find to be certain.  And I found the painting that I’ve yet to hang, the one give to me and subsequently painted by one Brandon Titus.  And I remember how long it’s been since I heard from Brandon, not since February, he’s in Iraq now.  I knew I needed to email him. 	I should have fled in Dallas.  I should have ran off to some as of yet unknown destination.  There’s no reason why my Bunburying should have ended as soon as it had.   	“It’s all right ma, it’s life and life only,” or so Bob Dylan kept telling me.  But the plane was slowing and falling, seeming to lower gravity as it did so.  The blood rushed to my head.  I knew soon I’d be in Austin, piling in a car, headed back to Fort Hood.  But, my days in Texas were even then growing fewer and fewer.  Soon I’d be out and on the road again.  Soon, but regretfully not soon enough.

      31 May 2004  	I’m a bit sad to go, despite the fact that the night prior was a near total wash.  I went out only to give up, to give in, to quit and come back to the hotel room.  And it had started off well.  Thanks to the miracle of direct deposit I’d gotten paid and so options for entertainment were pretty wide open.  I hit the cash machine as I was calling Tanya.  Her mother was cooking her dinner and she felt like Hell, not exactly what I wanted to hear.  I didn’t make a big deal out of it, I tried to be more mature than walking away from that fight the night prior.  I tried not to make it known that my only hope of seeing her again rested on her agreeing to come out.  So, I closed the distance between us, half the span of Vancouver and called her after I ate. 	She still wasn’t feeling well, but she’d call me back in a while.  And that became the trend for the evening.  As I wandered about she’d call.  And then she’d say she’d call back later and I’d go back to wandering.  So, I took off, wallet fat with Canadian cash and in search of ways to alleviate the sense of lonely boredom that was spreading over me.  Vancouver was nice, but when compared with New York City, it seemed almost one dimensional, it seemed almost quaint and polite.  Perhaps I was just viewing it from behind a cloud of emotions. 	I wandered around non-committal, hitting the Virgin Mega-store when I really just wanted to find a cozy, out of the way, High Fidelity-esque record shop.  I spend roughly eighty dollars American and walked out with four CDs, running the eclectic gamut from Bob Dylan’s self titled 1961 release to the Electric Six album ‘Fire’.  With my tiny Virgin bag I once again set to wandering.  Down and further down Robson and into the more midtown district, with the high-end fashion shops and institutions of a greater fiscal gravity.  Finally I just stopped walking.  She’d called and she just wasn’t well, still, and it was getting late, the sun setting, and I was flying solo.  Left up to myself, I knew the night was already a waste.  It was over and I couldn’t blame Tanya for it, but pride didn’t allow me to accept the blame myself.  So, I found a bar.  An Irish-pub themed joint that was part of a hotel, a place called Doolin’s.  And I sat down and had a Highball, and then another.  The cat next to me, an American hung up on whether he was going to sleep on the beach tonight or go back to his hotel room, was completely tossed on absinthe, he’d had one earlier.  I was not impressed.  I, the guy who’d been known to type legibly on seven in one sitting.  But, la fae verte had made its way over to Canada’s Pacific coast.  From what I gathered, they apparently brutalize it, drinking it in shot form.  I cannot help but be abhorred by this.  For all the absinthe I’ve drank in the years since we first kissed, I’ve always aligned with the Parisian serving style.  I don’t burn my sugar.  I don’t drink it as a shot.  I enjoy the drink with water and sugar.   	And there in the bar, that downtrodden sense of confusion didn’t leave me.  And it didn’t as I set to wandering the streets again.  It was all very Sophia Copula, except that I was lost without the need for translation.  Alone.  Wandering.  I didn’t to worry about money, but the sun was setting and with it the cold was creeping in, sending icy fingers through my clothes.  Alone.  Wandering.  Cold.  Lost. 	I hailed a cab and quit.  I didn’t expect a phone call.  I didn’t expect anything else because when you don’t expect anything you can’t be let down.  No, I couldn’t be let down.  I was headed back to the hotel and I thought about the casino, but Bob Dylan’s words echoed in my mind – ‘Money doesn’t talk, it swears.’  And I wanted to smile at how far south my luck had turned and could feel the palpable lump of sadness, for in roughly twelve hours from the moment I was sitting in the cab, I’d be on a plane and traveling to New York City, once again, by way of Toronto – where the smokers are an endangered species on display for those who don’t imbibe in tobacco.  And from La Guardia somehow I’d find my way to Penn Station, and then down to Philly, and then on the way to my parents’ house, the final leg of my journey.   	Sunday night left me hurting, and I knew I was feeling emotionally and physically lethargic prior to ten, prior to Tanya’s call.  Probably immature, stiff upper lip and all that.  But, then, that was the fact of the matter.  So, there in my hotel room I lay in bed, smoking cigarettes, I flipped alternately between Moulin Rogue and Dead Poets’ Society on television.   	On the other side of the city Tanya was doing the same.  There was a great deal of self-pity in Vancouver that Sunday night, if only between the two of us.  The world was not a kind place, as human beings with our soft pink skin are far too fragile.  We should come with signs that say ‘Easily Bruised’.  I fell asleep, my bags were already packed and my cell phone and alarm clock were already set for the morning.  And then at one AM I was woken up by a ringing phone.  It was Tanya, it was a wonderful wake up call, albeit a bit early, or late depending on whether one was standing on their head or their hands.   	And we chatted for several minutes, myself not even aware of the time as I struggled to sit up in bed and light a cigarette.  I think we both wanted more out of the day, wanted more out of Sunday than fighting hangovers and loathing.  But, it felt good to talk, even if it was just over the phone and she seemed to be in a slightly better mood if not yet achieving a level known as good.  And she said she’d call tomorrow night too.  So, in the end, all wasn’t lost in Canada on that one Sunday.  I think a connection might have been made between, and I hope, I truly hope, that I am better off because of it.  And sure, all the things I’d planned on doing never quite happened, or did in other manners, in the end, I still kissed the girl.  And she still called me.  I guess time will tell on that one.  It’s foolish to keep guessing.  Honestly, as I sat in a plane somewhere over the Canadian wilderness all I wanted was more leg room and a cigarette.  And what I really needed was to get back to work on script edits and my second novel.   	And so my own saga continued.  After waiting through a ridiculously long customs line and fearing a missed plane, being a citizen and a soldier – the two things I wished I weren’t everywhere else in Canada – I got pushed to the front of the Customs line.  The inspector rushed me through without as much as a bag search.  I was honest with him, aside from three Cuban cigars, I didn’t have anything.  I’m wasn’t even yet on American soil, and I could feel the tug of pride in my actions pulling at me.  I did what my country had asked me to do.  If my country wants to give me preference than who am I to deny it?  The stigma of Vietnam still remains, and has been reversed by the second Iraqi war.  Even if people disagreed with the war, they do no disagree with the soldiers.  The slogan, “We support the soldiers, not the war” still comes readily to mind.  Not that I take advantage of my veteran trump card, but I know I did some important things, just as nearly a million of my peers have in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  And if citizens of other countries do not realize that, Americans make up for it with vehement zeal.   	I was still an hour’s flight from La Guardia.  I was still an hour from the relative safety of the city that never sleeps.  I called Tanya, to let her know that I was safe, at least on the surface.  Underneath I called because I wanted to talk to her, to be on her mind and in her thoughts if I couldn’t be with her.  And it wasn’t love, rather it was greed – a compulsion to be wanted and appreciated by someone who I both want and appreciate.   	I wasn’t even back in the States yet, not yet back at work, not yet out of the Army, and yet done with a traveling experience that, as much as airlines attempt, is still not comfortable.  Ticking away inside, I was already planning my next trip, considering the lessons that I learned, that next time I should find a closer hotel, instead of putting an entire city between us, next time I’ll bring my passport to make Customs easier.  Hopefully next time I’ll talk a longer vacation.  I’ll find some place that charges by the week and go up to Canada and write while I’m there.  I’ll take my focus off of trying to make the most out of every minute and rather allow myself several deviations so that I can make the most out of everything, everything other than time.  The further I got away, the further the lines blurred, the safer, the more muted things were, the more everything really went my way.  Was it my fault?  Wasn’t it?  Could I say that now, after my initial reaction had time to cool naked on the plate?   	I had a dream on the way over, on the flight to Toronto.  I dreamt that I had run into Ben Kweller and the two of us had got to talking and I’d done the usual fan-based reaction, trying to play it cool while informing Ben that I’d seen him in concert, that his performance had surprised me, and that I owned a couple of his CDs.  But, the sticker with that dream was that I’d told him I’d gone to his concert to see Death Cab For Cutie.  Their CD, ‘Transatlanticism’ had come into my life at a point where I couldn’t deny it, when its message stuck so deep and rang so true that nothing else could ever have made as much sense.  Of course, seven years prior, Sponge’s CD ‘Rotting Pinata’ had the same affect, drawing all of my life into perspective, putting everything into light, into focus, all at once.  Perhaps it meant something.  Perhaps it was simply the phrase “I need you so much closer, so come on, come on, come on” that applied a subtle and justifiable force, an adequate notion both when the CD, when the title track had rooted itself into my mind so many months prior, and to my adventure of those too few prior days.  Transatlanticism was a tryst, a brief few days on nonstop listening, of lust.  And I wondered, could I ever recapture that flame, the one that burst from that CD, through my headphones, into my ears, could I ever get that back again?  The concert answered that, with Death Cab closing with my song, with Transatlanticism, it was the closing note I wanted.  And it was good.  It was right.   	Read into that as much or as little as you wish.  In Toronto it was time to take off.  It was time to go back to America.  The delays were done with their delaying.  It was a damn good thing I’d managed to squeeze in two cigarettes between Customs and boarding.  I wanted so badly to just fall asleep and to wake up in New York.  That was a notion I’d had so many nights when I was in Iraq.  I wanted to wake up back in the dream.  Manhattan was food.  Manhattan was Marlboros.  Manhattan was a train ride to Philly.

      30 May 2004  	It was quarter after four, and all I’d done that day was clean myself up and kill a rather vicious hangover, the kind where relief only comes from crawling to the toilet and vomiting whatever might remain in one’s stomach out.  The night prior had been incredibly political, the type of politics I hadn’t been looking for, after all, this was in the first and truest sense, a vacation.  For the most part, I hadn’t noticed a significant difference between America and Canada.  At the personal level, when viewed as individuals, there isn’t really a difference at all.  But, I was put into a position trying to defend my country as a whole and my leaders to people who were earnestly and doggedly professing the greatness of Canada – the land of the free.  And irony picking the one person who hadn’t taken part in the conversation, debate, argument, at all: Tanya.  She’d gone outside, into the cold and the rain (here’s where my sweater and hat came into play) and was smoking a joint with a guy from work, Tom.  Inside the greatness of the Canadian police policy had been bragged about.  In Canada the police can not search you, or so it was stated.  The police searched Tanya and threatened her with arrest.  This certainly put a terrible spin on the night for her.  Nothing like police intervention to kill your buzz. 	I was nineteen once.  I’d been at Fort Stewart for nearly two months and we’d just gotten back from nearly a month spent out in the swamps.  We’d gotten the idea into our head to all go out, as a group, the majority of my squad, and we’d all get hammered together.  I had just started drinking then, not doing so in high school and not looking back since.  We, and there was enough of us to fill three cars, piled into a bar and grill named Buffalos.  We proceeded to get blitzed out of our minds.  I quickly learned to like beer, if only because the price was right.  Jon, a fellow soldier, learned he was no Frank Sinatra while up on the karaoke stage, despite singing a Rolling Stones song.  From there we got the idea in our heads to go to a local club called Hurricanes.  We piled in the cars.  We had two sober drivers.  Another swore he was sober enough to drive, and he jumped in Jon’s car, along with Jon, and the three of us took of into the night, heading towards Hurricanes.  We missed the turn and pulled into a gas station.  Drunken disorderly conduct occurred inside.  Nothing illegal, just loud and rude.  We came out, we got back into the cars.  A police cruiser passed the car I was in.  I instantly noticed it.  Hernandez, the sober driver, said it was nothing.  Then another passed us.  I got real sober, real quick.  All in all five cars showed up, five police cars.  They got us all.  The driver of Jon’s car was the only one to get a breathalyzer.  The other drivers were blatantly sober.  The driver was taken into custody.  The rest of us could only go home, the night ruined.  Of course the police in Hinesville target soldiers, it’s how they make their money.   	Yes, the police often ruin a night out.  But I refused to let that get to me.  I was out with Tanya.  We were in a bar, the kind that tries to look run-down, but is too new, with too many people to truly be beaten up by the world.  Short of incoming fire or thrown drinks, my night was not going to be ruined.  While no one shot, punches were almost thrown.  I narrowly avoided a fight that I so wanted to happen.  Dave, an Irishman who was drinking with us, and I went outside for a cigarette and were approached by a very drunk Canadian.  Dave and I were talking, and this guy was listening to our conversation.  He refused to believe that I was an American soldier and instead launched into a tirade on how I was disgracing all those who were in Iraq and who were serving.  He went as far as to very lightly slap me on the cheek.  It was my right cheek.  It didn’t hurt anything but my pride.  I reigned in some superhuman restraint.  I walked away. 	I might not be the best soldier.  I’m good at what I do, but I no longer live for the Army.  I do know where I’ve been and I have been where I have been.  Of all the people in the bar that night, probably on the block, perhaps in the city if the Ranger population wasn’t too heavy that night, there was a significant chance I was the only who’d actually been to Iraq.  I was the only one who formed my opinions first hand as opposed to the others to views of others or heaven forbid the media. 	But from the bar we split up, going back to this cat Tom’s apartment.  He was a friend of Tanya and seemed to be a genuinely good guy.  The group of us piled into a cab, paying the driver an extra, a high flat rate so that he’d drive with more than the maximum occupancy in the vehicle.  This, at the end of the ride, drew a racial slur from the extra man, yelling something in Indian that I was a little too inebriated to catch.   	We rushed up the stairs and into Tom’s tiny apartment.  Inside a line formed at the bathroom immediately.  Eighties music was put on the stereo, and we quickly started to put a serious dent in the beer on hand.   	Conversations started to develop, stemming mostly from the guy with the racial slur, who went on in a very drunken and meandering manner to explain his dislike of Vancouver’s level of immigrants – which there were a great deal – and his hatred of Phillip Morris – who produces my brand of cigarettes – and on to tyranny in general.   	And it made me wonder – was he opposed to tyranny, or was he opposed to tyranny by someone other than himself?  I think that most people have the inherent desire to do things their way.  In the famous words of Tears For Fears, “Everybody wants to rule the world.”  But, I firmly believe that you cannot please everyone all the time, or some of the time, or even at all.  I think that exceptions will always surface – the drunk who unsuccessfully tried to start a fight with me, the police who searched Tanya – and it’s the exceptions that tend to be focused upon, because they are not normal.  And in the right hands, what isn’t normal is the sensational.  I know that holds true where Iraq is concerned.  It wasn’t the countless boring days spent staring at the vast and so familiar-if-foreign landscape that make the news.  Rather, it’s the one incident that takes a life and gives the media a rise.  	But, as I sat alternating from escaping the drunken conversations of the Rambler and chatting with Tom and Tanya (who was commanding the majority of my attention even if she hadn’t intended to) and Lucas, when we quickly ran out of beer. 	Apparently in Vancouver, liquor at night is a rare commodity, purchased back alley style like heroin in the States.  Tom decided that Lucas and the Rambler could be left at the apartment while Tanya, who just wanted something to eat, and I would accompany Tom.  Tom was still finishing his beer, still half full, we piled into his black Camaro.   The three of us flew off into the night that was in full swing in downtown Vancouver to a small Palestinian owned store where after hours a fifth of liquor can be purchased for around forty five dollars.  That is, if the owners know you.  We came back out to the car with the most over priced bottle of nameless vodka I’ve ever seen.  Tanya had stayed with the car, we got in, Tom tried to start it.  Tried and failed.  No dice.  The battery was acting up, or rather, not acting.  To make it worse we were parked in a bus parking spot, and eight or so of Vancouver’s finest had taken to standing just next to the car.  Open container.  Intoxicated driver.  Stalled car.  American soldier who probably shouldn’t be out of the country.  It was a veritable witches brew of bad things.  It could have  been a lot worse than it was.  Despite it being nearly two in the morning, the police were neither rude nor pushy.  In fact, they were rather conversationally polite.  They took Tom’s license and gave him a gave him a ticket for having an open container, told us to flag down a cab or get a wrecker to get a jump.  They told us to do whatever so we could move on. 	I got out, flagged down a cab, paid him fifteen bucks, and together, the cabby and I, we jumped the car.  Then that was that.  Tom headed back to the apartment, proud that he got away with only a ticket and disregarding Tanya’s pleas to run through a drive through.  That was it for her.  Two visits by the police, no food, and drunk.  She’d had enough.  Her night had been a wash.  To me it was all an experience, fodder to write about, lessons learned and a spot to grow from.  Like I noted earlier, I do my best to not let other people get me down.  To make mine what is mine.  It did hurt though, seeing the night punish Tanya for just trying to have a good time, for just trying to show me a good time.  It pained me to not see her smiling.  I couldn’t help it, I’ve become bewitched by her smile, it was after all a very good smile. 	Sometime around three in the morning we both caught cabs, each heading in opposite directions.  It felt wrong to do that.  Had my life ended right there, right then, I would have gone out on a very sour note.  The audience would have wanted their money back.  It makes me think about wanting happy endings.  And it makes me think about the whole world being a comedy, but everyone in it is a tragedy in the making.  I don’t know who said it, but they were spot on. 	The day worked on, it was almost six o’clock in the evening.  I hadn’t put my pen down for nearly two hours, well.  I put it down twice, but it was brief, just long enough to answer the phone and start writing again.  The first call was from Dan, he was stuck in Chicago, mother nature was prolonging his leave through successive flight delays.  The other call was from Tanya, her spill of bad luck hadn’t ended.  She wasn’t feeling well, she was angry at Tom for his behavior the night prior, for a phone call he made at ten in the morning, for the fact that as I was writing he was still drinking. 	Me, I was going to take what was mine and looked at getting a cab and finding food and finding a good time.  After all, this was my vacation, my adventure, and I was going to take what’s mine even if I had to do it alone.

      29 May 2004 (cont.)  	Thursday in New York we went back to the city.  We spent a great deal of the morning in White Plains, at a friend of Jordan’s work.  In the evening we hooked up with another friend, a guy named Joey, and we once again disappeared into the glow of Manhattan. 	We fought and parked, headed over to Arturo’s, to link up with Flavia.  Then the drama started.  Three guys and a girl, add in some live jazz and the situation could not progress any better.  Factor in an addiction to cocaine, and the ride turns into a rollercoaster.  Wine led to a need for blow, the craving manifested as a general irritation and then claustrophobia.   	And when this feeling is felt at a dinner table, the result echoes as reciprocation and further anger, brewing tempest of emotions.  Of course I refused to let the addiction of Joey or the anger of Jordan interfere, refused to let others exercise control over my night, my experience, my life.  After all these things were mine. 	I turned to talk to Flavia, attractive both as a woman and as a business associate.  My plan, to outweigh the negative of my youth with cutting brilliance, to prove that if I was spouting off then I was doing so with a greater level of education than my records would betray, not that I was merely spouting off in youth.  I was examining and attempting to correct my world.  After all, Bob Dylan had already established his brilliance when he was younger than me.  So I carried on the conversation at great lengths on philosophy, on writing, on money, on life.  I spoke of creating and on the creations of others.  And I did on my typical quasi-gentleman style, with my usual act of untouchable flamboyance.  I was at the top of my game.  I was described by Flavia as an ‘intellectual, which is very rare for an American to be.’  I proved my point. 	While the night might not have been a blast for Jordan or Joey, and Flavia chose to remain at Arturo’s, we slipped off into the night only to return to the car, and make it back to the house in Verplank.  I had to wake up in four hours, but I wanted so much to wake up, I wanted to know what was on the other end of that plane ride.  I wanted to know what Canada might have in store for me. 	A post script on Canadian airports.  Smoking is left to glass jars buried in the rear of a few bars.  There smokers can be exhibited like rare and dangerous animals.  At least that’s how it is in Toronto.

      29 May 2004  	Early evening is already there as I sat alone in my hotel room, nearly naked and smoking a cigarette.  The room was wrapped in silence as much as I was wrapped in my headphones, quietly contemplating through the amazing channeling powers of a fountain pen.   	Yesterday had been very bright and sunny, even warm.  The sweater and hat I’d picked up in New York in the event of a very Canadian day were put away, tossed onto a half unpacked bag shoved against the wall near the foot of my oddly uncomfortable hotel room bed.  But that day, as I sat there writing and smoking, it was a very Canadian day.  The sky was spitting rain at random and godless intervals, the wind whispering in rushes and Tanya had slipped off, leaving me alone.  She’d gone for a change of clothes and a shower.  Later we’d link up, we’d go out and she’d introduce me to Canada, the part that exists outside of my hotel room walls, outside of the street below that could be American if the gas prices weren’t so cheap. 	I’d wandered about the airport the day prior, half worrying, the other half looking and expecting.  I’d heaved my bags onto my shoulders, I’d gone outside and smoked cigarettes and I did that thing you do, when you’re looking for someone and you don’t exactly know what to look for.  I glance long and hard, looking for some sort of feedback, putting everyone I saw up against the cookie-cutter image that I had of Tanya in my mind.  I knew how tall she was, and how little she weighed, I knew what she looked like on camera, being in possession of several photos and having video chatted numerous times.  And she had that same cookie-cutter image of me.  I looked for someone who fit the image, the fantasy person that I’d erected in my mind, looked for someone who was in the general ball park of that fantasy, or anyone who seemed to be looking for me.  Everyone at an airport is looking for someone though, everyone wants someone there, airports are supposed to be houses of love, like churches, only instead of God being a timeless mind-boggling distance away, the gods of airports are there and waiting, and they hug and they touch, and in that brief period the trip’s length doesn’t matter, the cost of the ticket is negligible, the time apart vanished.  The gods of airports erase all things and for probably the only time in a person’s life, the only thing that matters in the entire world is that one moment, that one embrace.  All else is forgotten, marked as immaterial, unimportant and exists only beyond the doors in some other world.   	I found Tanya, my own personal airport god only after my cell phone shook its way to life, waking up after the nearly ten hours of my trip.  Finding her wasn’t easy, she called from a pay phone somewhere in the airport.  I put all my training to use, running from banks of phones to banks of phones.  We traded landmarks over quick consecutive calls.  And I ran as quickly as I could walk, my eyes keying in on anything, something close to that cookie-cutter fantasy.  Burger King.  She’d said something about Burger King in the garbled quickly snatched phone conversation.  I grabbed a guy at an information booth. Where’s Burger King? “About a five minute walk that way.” Five?  I’d be there in three.  I took off down the hall in the direction that he’d pointed, leaving the arrivals area and ending up in the departure.  And the mix up? What the cab driver had misunderstood, the departure area is also the international arrival area.  Only I stopped being international once the plane took off in Toronto.  I had become just like any other traveler.  I found the Burger King, set up food court style and there were payphones right there, I waded in between the tables, looking, doing my best to match up people to ideas, but to no luck.   I spied an escalator going down, above it a sign that said ‘Arrivals’.  I turned about in a circle.  Above me towered a hanging Native totem pole.  Alone one wall was a restaurant called something crazy like ”Elephant and Castle”.  The name triggered something, put together a few puzzle pieces that had been flapping about in my mind.  I started over there, I think I heard my name.  Maybe I just heard someone yell ‘Hey.” I’m conditioned to turn towards that too, especially when looking for someone calling out just that. 	When I’d first gotten to Fort Stewart I was outside of a Walmart on the edges of Savannah with a few Army buddies.  We were walking into the store from the car when a group of girls were standing outside.  They were plainly in high school, read, they were too young and not nearly interesting enough no matter how easy the conquest might have been. Did I mention I’m a soldier?  Mind you, back in 1999 those words didn’t pack the same patriotic punch that they do today, but, we were oh so young, and to us that was our definition of life.  We were soldiers.  One of the girls, a member of the gaggle calls out, “Hey!” in a thick dirty-south accent.  We all keep working.  “Hey, Joe!” had been branded into our mines, drill Sergeants having done their duty, teaching us to never look, for turning to see was as good as volunteering.  “Hey! I said ‘hey!’” was announced once again from in that sloppy, dirty accent.  We turned.  Tony, little guy, young looking too, nodded and replied. “Hey.” And then we walked into Walmart, the high school girls following us.  We split up.  They split up.  Girls were a lot different than Drill Sergeants, but turning around was still as good as volunteering. 	I turned around.  It was a good time to volunteer.  From out of a group of tables came a lithe, tan, brunette.  She was wearing a tank top often referred to as a ‘strappy tank’ and a skirt.  Oh so trendy, nearly clear sunglasses perched on top of her head.  She was much better looking than in photos, angles that had appeared sharp were softened by reality, her nose taking on very attractive button-esque quality.  And she hugged me, and she smiled.  And she told me I was just in time because a guy who hadn’t been able to find his airport god was looking for one in her.  And he wasn’t able to comprehend the word no.  But, at that moment, she was my airplane god.  And yet she wasn’t.  She was someone I thought I knew, but instead she was someone new.  The whole thing was a new twist on an old song, and it rung with the signs of fantasy.  It was perhaps the worlds longest blind date, measured in distance rather than time.   	We fled outside, to the bright sunlight, and immediately receded to darkness of a parking garage.   	“Where are we going?” 	You don’t remember where you parked? 	“I took a cab.” 	Oh. 	“Well, I need a cigarette.” 	Me too. 	“I can’t believe you smoke those, they’re so strong.” 	As Nick Hornby pointed out in  High Fidelity  (a movie that draws too many comparisons to my life) “what problems that are there are cute problems, like we bought each other the same Christmas present.” 	With cigarettes out we flagged a cab and head down the road to a hotel I’d booked while waiting in the airport lobby.  The man at the counter, I hesitate to give a Quality Inn any greater title than that, was dismayed at the rate I’d been given, almost half of what the room should have cost me.  And yet I was not worried, rather, I was much more relieved.  Money was already starting to run short.  Not dangerously low, but short, and corners were made for cutting, weren’t they?  So, we went up to the room and then we were confronted with what to do.  I needed a shower.  It’s a habit, get off a plane at whatever is my temporary final destination (for I’ve yet to find a true final destination in my life), and I need to shower.  After the shower it became a matter of what to do.  Did we want to go out?  Did we want to eat?  We were both starving.  How about ordering in a pizza and then deciding? 	We did that, well, half of that.  We never decided where to go.  Rather the television came on and we became engrossed in the Simpsons, and then we switched to watching the provided free movie channels.  We slipped downstairs to the liquor store.  I have to give the Quality Inn credit – it had a liquor store, a restaurant, a bar, a bowling alley, and a casino all under one roof.  There was no internet access in the room and there wasn’t an iron available, which boggles me, how can you operate a hotel within a short distance of an airport and not provide irons?  Traveling has to be the most wrinkle inducing activity, with bags tossed by guys called Tossers, into holds with other tossed bags, jumbled up during flight, tossed off onto a truck, and then tossed onto a conveyer belt.  That’s a whole lot of tossing.  I felt almost bad about bringing beer to the room, like we should have been going out, like I should have been more entertaining, more energetic, taking more out of life and being that Bohemian ideal that I represent on the internet and in my writing.  And yet I wasn’t.  I’d been up since nearly three AM pacific time.  I’d spent nearly ten hours on air planes.  I’d flown clear across the continent and worked my way through Canadian customs, drawing up an excuse to be able to cross the border on only a military ID card and with no birth certificate.  Laying in bed, smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, watching television – that was my idea of a vacation, at least right then.   	We engaged in small talk, bantering back and forth about the differences between our oh so similar countries.  I couldn’t speak much about Canada, having my experiences limited to a spectacular view of the Canadian Rockies from above, a noting of the sheer amount of Canadians wearing straw cowboy hats (I saw at least a dozen in the Toronto airport, more than I’ve ever seen at one non-cowboy themed place in the States, and at the moment I live in Texas.)  Tanya got up, rolling a second joint, and strolled over to our balcony (glorified term) door to smoke it.  She’d had her first a few hours ago, while I was in the shower.  I had told her I’d be out of the shower before she was done smoking it.  I’d been wrong.  Life’s more interesting when I’m wrong.   	My phone had rung a few times.  Dan, of the greatest people I’ve ever met and one whom I could not imagine having gone to Iraq without called.  He wanted to make sure I was safe, and offer his hand, being just outside of Seattle and only a few hours away by car.  He wanted me to know that I was still safe, just as we’d done so many times during the war.  I told him I wasn’t worried, but I had my phone.  And he had my trust in him.  During the war, when we got split up and stopped convoying together, our pre-travel tradition was a pause before leaving, ‘Don’t die out there.  I still need you.’  It was half in jest.  But it was also betrayingly serious. The other was Tony.  The guy with the unfortunate nick name of ‘Cherry’ having been one of the last to arrive in Iraq.  He wanted to know if Tanya was there.  I tossed her the phone to tell him herself.  She gave it back after a quick chat.  Tony also wanted to let me know that his brother had found the Holy Grail, the item that had been alluding me for so a few weeks now.  Olive juice.  Totally serious.  It’s the missing ingredient in a proper Dirty Martini.  You can’t find it in Texas.  It was his goal, his sole mission directed from me for his leave.   	We shifted to lying down.  Tanya with her Smirnoff Ice, me with my beer, and slowly we started to move closer together, watching television.  She asked for a massage.  I did my best not to obviously leap at the opportunity.  Later the television became background noise, as I spoke and spoke, rattling on, tales of the Army, tales of friendship, and she smiled the most wonderful smile.  At one point she sat up, her arms around her knees, her hair falling over her shoulders and in front of her face.  A pair of sparkling brown eyes, the kind that let you know she’s smiling even if you can’t see her mouth, shown over that bare shoulder.  At that moment I was totally lost.  The entire trip was worth those eyes.  The world could have ended at that very moment, and I’d have only regretted never seeing them again.  The most secret of regrets, the most selfish.  And yet, it’s so true, so strikingly true.   	Time marched on, though I failed to notice.  I wasn’t tired.  I’d been awake for nearly twenty hours and I’d barely eaten, and yet, it didn’t matter.  Food, sleep, they meant nothing.  I didn’t want them, didn’t want the distractions, for Tanya had grown closer.  We’d been together for hours, talked for countless more, and yet I hadn’t figured her out.  The world that existed between her ears, behind those eyes was still largely a mystery.  She was staking up, beating the odds, usually I’ve got people pretty figured out by then.  And she moved closer, her head on my shoulder.  We were talking so close that words were almost-kisses.  Each other’s air brushed against lips, and she was so close that gravity could have done me in, forced me down, placed us in a kiss.  And I didn’t know, was it the pot, was it the alcohol?  Did she know what she was doing?  But her eyes convinced me otherwise.  And I kissed her.  And at first it seemed like it might have been a mistake, like I shouldn’t have done it.  Just to make sure, I did it again.  And again.  And we rolled about, tiring ourselves out in physical appeal.  We didn’t have sex, we didn’t make love, we didn’t screw, we just enjoyed each other’s company.  It was affection, it was unspoken answers to questions that perhaps we just both wanted to ask.  I was thankful for it.   	She didn’t know.  I mean, she might have guessed.  But she was the first person I’d kissed in nearly a year, Iraq getting in the way of my social life.  War presented problems in dating that I’d never had to bother with before, the desert bringing with it a new meaning to dry spell.   	And as we lay there mostly naked and in each other’s arms, the hotel room smoky, the ash tray quite full.  In the darkness Tanya told me I wasn’t allowed to fall asleep first.  I didn’t.  I didn’t need sleep, I didn’t need anything. 	I woke up early.  I sat up nearly naked in bed, I smoked cigarettes.  I rolled over.  I went back to sleep.  That process repeated itself until sometime near noon, the exact hour escaping me because frankly, who needs time?  And in bed we sat and debated, considering food, considering what to do.  Tanya still smiled.  She got up, dressed in only panties, and walked over to the balcony door.  Opening it, shielding herself with the curtain, and smoked another joint.  Pot to her was much like alcohol to me, drinking is just something I do, it’s how I take down walls, open doors, find bridges.  I’m much more social when I drink, reserves disappear, the ‘me’ shines through.  And I got up, put some clothes on, jeans, such a difference for me, not something I do, but with the lack of an iron, slacks were right out of the question.  I disappeared downstairs, ordered not to take too long but to come back with a hamburger.  I got one of the two right, and I came back up stairs and we both ate and watched some television.   	Tanya slipped off around three, catching a cab to her house, seeking a shower of her own, and clean clothes.  She’d call later, we’d go out, have some drinks.  Finally I’d be introduced to the city that exists outside of the hotel and its self contained world.  In the mean time the room was a wreck, I had a little of sixty dollars Canadian in my wallet and time on my hands.  Time had returned and suddenly I needed it.  I needed it to move faster, so that the phone call would come and then I could go out.  I was marginally rested, and tonight I could be the Bohemian that Tanya had thought was coming to visit her.  I sat for a bit, fighting with the television, trying to get something good to come on.  CNN showed a clip from the West Point graduation.  I had friends there, friends who just that day suddenly outranked me, suddenly were officers, and gentlemen, and ladies.  Commissioned and with character.  I had to get out of the smoky-stained room.  I put the maid-service sign on the door and fled down to the casino. 	I’ve got luck with cards, so the saying goes that rightly I don’t have the best luck at love.  I sat at a nearly empty black jack table and cashed in fifty dollars.  I could afford to lose that.  I had an ATM card.  It reminded me of a time when I couldn’t afford to lose the forty dollars I sat down with.  I was on a cruise with one of my closest friends.  He and I were the type of friends who could sit in a car and drive without speaking and not only be totally content with it, but enjoy it.  The kind of friends who could, and alarmingly often did, finish each other’s sentences.  The black jack dealer was cute, strikingly attractive and Bulgarian.  I’d never met anyone from Bulgaria before, and like I said she was attractive.  I’d spent a good many hours at her table.  And I’d learned that whenever G.R. walked into the casino my luck would take a startling turn south.  Like double down and get a three bad.  I learned to not gamble when he was around.  Which is funny, because I’m usually gambling if not at cards than at life.  It was the last day of the cruise, time to pony up and pay the bill, but I was $40 short, and that’s with the $40 in my wallet.  I could have borrowed the money, I’m quite certain he wouldn’t have cared, he never had before.  But, I still had a chance.  I told him to stay away from the casino, I’d be back shortly.  I went down, I took my last forty dollars.  I cashed it in, I lit a cigarette and won my way up to ninety.  I crushed out another cigarette, took my chips, bid my Bulgarian black jack dealer farewell, and cashed out.  I bought myself a drink and settled my bill. 	That Saturday afternoon was like and unlike that.  I sat down with my fifty dollars, won my way up to a hundred.  The dealer changed, alas it wasn’t an attractive twenty something Bulgarian, rather a mid-forties man changing to a mid-thirties woman and I had Tanya on the brain anyway.  She slipped and paid me for a hand I’d lost.  Free ten bucks.  Good for me.  And I managed to slug my way up to one fifty.  A smart man would have walked away, tripling my money was something.  But smart men don’t gamble.  And almost as if G.R. had walked into the casino, my luck nose dived.  I started going down.  Once in high school, for a no-real-money game I’d won and won and won and put all of my chips on one last hand.  I won that too.  I’ll never do that again.  I sat and looked.  I had a hundred dollars in chips.  Good enough for me.  I took my chips and wandered through the maze that is the casino over to the cashier’s booth.  I needed a cigarette anyway.

      28 May 2004  	This had become what I call my North American Bohemian Tour, and from the first few days it’s the first of many to be certain.  The first leg of my tour, Greenwich Village, is now complete. 	I was actually descending into Toronto, magically arriving twenty minutes early as turbulence had somehow cut twenty minutes off our flight time.  I didn’t know how it had happened, a modest knowledge of the jet stream said that we shouldn’t have been able to get here faster, only slower, but I wasn’t going to complain.  I was already in coach, already cramped into a seat.  I only hoped that the same thing would happen en route to Vancouver, and I could get off a plane and once again get the ball rolling again. 	The village was certainly interesting.  As soon as I got into La Guardia and inhaled with rapid succession a few cigarettes, grabbed my checked bag, I hopped into Jordan’s car only to disappear into traffic and off into the Hudson River Valley.  The area held some hard times for me.  It’s where On The Road met it’s first snag, in the rain at the Bear Mountain Bridge.  It’s where I’d slugged out nine months of wasted time at West Point.  It’s where Jordan lived.  Jordan, my business partner, my brother in commitment, the one who’d supplied the story, the story I’d turned into a screenplay, the screenplay that I was banking my dreams on, dreams of California, dreams of becoming appreciated as a writer, of being able to break free of the status quo, and able to create and write and to make the endeavors that refused to sit still in my mind, to march onwards, figuring everything out, the dream that I could do something that might save the world, to pull it out of the nose dive and return people from the status of consumers.   	We darted along highways that were lined with trees and the mighty Hudson appeared to our side in soft whispers and sudden, breathless gasps.  I got to Jordan’s house.  I showered off the funk of flying and we hopped back onto the train, disappearing once again into the city.  We disappeared so we could reappear into our familiar Village haunts, the place where we were ghosts to the dead that occupy it, and they didn’t know, we were doing our best to be alive, and they were doing their best to just not be dead.  We started as always with a very fast, very hungry dinner at Arturo’s, an Italian restaurant / piano-jazz bar on West Broadway and Houston.  It’s pronounced How-ston, not hyu-s-ton (the city in Texas) for those of you who haven’t been there.  Houston Street is the ‘zero’ street.  While the rest of New York is divided into by numerical streets and avenues, Houston is the street where the numbers end and the names begin.  Below Houston you’ve got SoHo (South Houston) and from there on down you’ve got the truly interesting areas, all sides of the Village, Chinatown, Little Italy, Tribeca, on and on until you reach the very southern tip, which is the financial area.  Fellow Bohemians beware, this is the dark side.  Tread carefully, but do not be afraid to take a look.   	Both Jordan and I were straving, and our food disappeared almost before we were finished being served.  Gone before it had a chance to realize it was there.  From there we vanished into rapidly aging Tuesday night.  We toured SoHo with a quickness, a jaunt down the blocks that were littered with memories for Jordan, surfacing in ‘glory day’ stories, the kind that manifest  into lengthy drug infested binges, four digit bar tabs, hordes of hanger-ons who did their best to pass as friends if only for the booze and the blow and the utter feeling of elated power which could only be experienced in the two places in the world where people can’t touch you – the very top and the very bottom. 	From the midst of nostalgia we swung over to Minetta’s Tavern for a few quiet drinks.  Minetta’s felt good, it was quiet and the atmosphere reeked of masked history, it was Zorro’s bar.  The walls were seeping with the secrets of the ages, but the few suits in the room were by all essential means deaf to the sanctity of the very grounds they were standing in.  Didn’t they know that this was a speak easy?  Didn’t they know that Reader’s Digest was founded in the very basement they were standing over?  Didn’t they know the greatest, most prolific American writers of the Lost Generation used to drink here?  Hemingway!  Fitzgerald!  Ford! 	Me, in a fumble over wallet, change, cell phone, and drink, had paid the price of a spilled drink.  My Highball (for those of you who don’t know – a ‘highball’ is Jameson’s Irish Whisky and Seven Up, with ice, in a highball glass) paid the price, spilling onto the bar.  I tossed the money for a second onto the bar and stepped out for a cigarette and a phone call.  Tony, or as he was known around the unit, ‘Cherry’ was on the phone.  Tony’s a good guy, one of the regulars I hang out with and not just because his room was right next door to mine.  He was a good guy, the kind of friend you’re glad to have around.  Once he turns twenty one, this up coming July, he’s going to be the kind of guy you like to go out with.  I have a soft spot for the guys who shined during the war.  I can’t turn them away.  I don’t think I’ll ever be able to.  Of course there were the other who I’d have as soon put a bullet into, but for the whole, the people you go to war with, the ones beside you, the guy to your left and the guy to your right, the ones who you truly suck with, you can’t say no now, just like you couldn’t say no then.  And they couldn’t say no then, and they can’t say no now.  So, I chatted with Tony and I went back in, I picked up my new drink, which the bartender was nice enough to not let me pay for, and got right back into drinking, right back into enjoying Minetta’s, because I knew, the suits next to me didn’t know, but I knew.  This place really was were it was at.  This place was and this place still is.  It’s waiting; history wraps itself around that bar, that tavern, that little sliver of ground floor real estate on Minetta and MacDougal.   	From Minetta’s we split, walking a few doors down to Café Reggio, the birthplace of cappuccino.  We sat outside, we had coffee, we smoked cigarettes.  Next door, Café Wha? was dead and so we opted for coffee and smokes.  It was Tuesday after all, only bad things happen on Tuesday.  So outside of Reggio we sat and people watched, we sat and drank coffee, we sat and smoked cigarettes.   	Sitting outside the café, I don’t know, I guess we attracted a bit of attention; a tall, thin white guy, and a short, olive-skinned Arab whose hair still had blue in it from a bet he’d won.  One such giver of attention, one such passer-by was a tall Brazilian woman, earlier thirties, thin, attractive, with a almost professional pink scarf tied around her neck.  She paused to bum a cigarette.  I, of course, was more than obliged.  And in the unspoken word, the unwritten law of the Village, when two people meet, and tobacco is exchanged, introductions and brief quasi-personal biographies are considered tax on the transaction.  Her name was Flavia, the first A is a long one.  She’s Italian by blood, Brazilian by heritage.  She moved to the States when she was thirteen.  She went to Catholic school.  She went to Europe for her under-grad.  She went to Yale for her graduate degree.   	What did you get your graduates’ in? 	“Film.” 	That’s incredible.  I swear.  And I then I double into our own story, of what Jordan and I do, of what Jordan and I did.   	We’re screenwriters. 	As the giver, as opposed to the give-ee, I had the freedom to choose just how forth coming I wished to be. 	The night ended shortly after, with us returning to the cold, and quickly turning to rainy, Hudson River Valley.  I always hated leaving the Village.  Part of me wished I never had to leave, that the string of experiences, each different, each new, each unique, is a way to lead a life, dashing down a constant string, delving into one interest after the other.  And then there’s something in life that doesn’t like me leaving the Village, doesn’t like me returning to the Hudson River Valley.  May, a routinely warm month, overly easy, the typical pause before the summer launches its humid assault, turns cold and forbidding.  The rains come.  The winds come.  They all come to meet me, to surround me in cold and wet, to encourage me to either return to the city or to flee back to from whence I came.  It was in this cold, in this wet, in that wind, that I was riding into, shuttling down tracks on the Metro North.

       Here it is, the first portion of what I'm tenatively giving the title "Bunburying" though that'll probably change.  More to follow, I'm posting this as a break while writing more.  Always writing more.  Drinking, smoking, writing more.   	I ran about my room the night prior to my first flight, the significance of the term not lost on me.  It was to be the first of many flights, nine flights, eight days, three time zones, two countries, and one crazy vacation.  But that’s not what was significant.  The first flight was my first time away, away from the Army, away from Texas, away from the means that had meant to dominate my life for the past year.  I packed, tossing clothes into a bag, grabbing my old soft leather bound notebook, my fountain pen, my copy of On the Road, my MP3 player, my lap top.  I tossed all that I needed into two bags and then split down to the CQ desk to sign out and get things officially going.   	Signing out was the act of freedom, that was it.  I was doing it, I was on vacation.  I was about to embark on my own adventure, and I had only a vague idea of what to expect.  Pictures from a girl, a house in Verplank, New York, the streets of the city, and my parents’ quasi-estate in rural Pennsylvania.  For the next eight days I wouldn’t be a soldier, I’d be a traveler, I’d be a writer, I’d be a twenty-three year old man, but above all, I wouldn’t be a soldier.  This was a time about not being a soldier, about not being that which I’d been so convincingly for nearly a year in Iraq, and for the better part of the past five years.  I’d let my hair grow, I’d got myself some sideburns.  I packed my least militant clothes – not that dressing as different from the military is a problem for me, most of my shirts are button-downs, most of pants are slacks.  I own two pairs of shoes other than for running, leather, one brown, one black.  Then I went to bed. 	A cab picked me up in the morning, taking me to Killeen Regional Airport.  I smoked a ‘fair well’ cigarette for Texas and boarded a plane.    25 May 2004  	It seemed like forever since I had picked up my notebook.  I’d just stowed my lap top and we were off, lifting off the ground in Houston.  I was in the first row, first class, on a trip from Texas to La Guardia.  Next to me, as seen from printed emails while he slept (left on his lap, I’m not that much of a snoop) was the CEO of an oil company based out of Houston.  Me, I’m a fraud, someone who shouldn’t be in first class, but the seats are a great deal more comfortable, and the leg room is plentiful even for someone of my length.  I refrain from saying size, as I’m a thin guy, but I’m unforgivingly tall, so I’m long when I’m sitting.   	The notion that this is my first escape plagues me.  I mean, this is it, it really was it.  I’d been back from Iraq for two months to the day, and here I was, on a plane, in first class.  It was my first time away.  I’d taken four days of R&R in Qatar, but I was there with other soldiers, and we were on an Army instillation.  It was all an illusion, we weren’t free, we were just removed from immediate danger and allowed three beers a day.  That was it.  It was tight rope six inches off the ground.  Once back in Texas the rope was raised a bit, but the fall still wouldn’t hurt if you did it right.  When I went out I was with other soldiers, I was within a few hours drive of Fort Hood at the most.  I was by all means ‘safe’, safe from myself, safe from the rest of the world.  That notion of safety bothered me.  I didn’t want to be safe.  The world isn’t safe.  We can die at any time.  I wanted to be out there and at risk, because who dares wins, right?  The safe view the world on cable television and experience everything through the confines of a box.  I wanted the chance of failure to at least present itself.  Only when we have nothing are we truly free, so said Chuck Palahntuk, so second me.   	So, despite knowing I’m in a first class seat on a plane, and knowing what the A and the B are, I’m not quite certain of where I am.  I set my sights on my eight crazy, Kerouac days, with nothing planned but the next destination and the inbetweens only waiting to be filled.  I did the math, I bought the tickets, and I called the cab.  And that was that.  I was taking a break from everything, from the Army, from writing – even though I sat on the plane scribbling out the thoughts that rammed about in my brain, bouncing off the walls in their asylum waltz, because I wasn’t creating, I was recording, because I wanted to remember this.  I wanted to remember regardless of whether things turned out good or bad, or worse, if things were merely lukewarm and indecisive.  I wanted to remember these eight days for better or for worse till death do I part. 	I had gotten on the net, and I’d booked tickets.  I’d met a girl, as all things start, a member of the opposite sex is alluring even if she doesn’t mean to.  I felt a connection there, but the internet is a fickle and oh so impractical jokester.  So, as my original plans for leave – a cross-country move, driving from New York to California in a mere six days – scrapped themselves, I decided that now I had the time, and now I had the money (a rarity, I assure you) and now I was young and always up for crazy experiences, because it’s the journey not the destination and all that so touted and unused cliché.  I booked a ticket to Vancouver, and I’d be there for three days, long enough to get a taste, and short enough to waste if things fell through, if gravity was a culprit again.  The odd thing, I’d be there for Memorial Day weekend.  The time that I should be remembering soldiers who didn’t make it.  The ones like me, but not like enough, the ones who didn’t make it through, not just in Iraq, but in all wars, and on all sides.  Soldiers all have that common bond, the connection of horrible circumstance.  Suffering forges bonds, deep ones.  But, I wasn’t going to think about that,  I promised myself, I was going to be in Vancouver and I was going to make the best out of whatever situation I could, to do what I could, to see what I could, to learn, to live, to experience. 	That plane trip was a few days away.  At that moment I was heading to the city, my city, my place amongst places where I was free to be, the city that never sleeps as the Frank referred to it.    Here’s where I call on old friends, here’s where I’m going to have drinks in the Village, here’s where what not and what have you.  Soon, and sitting on the plane, sitting there in first class where the drinks really are free and the stewards and stewardesses really do treat you better than human, sitting there I knew that my money would soon run out.  I knew I’d be finishing my trip at my parents’ house, that place just a step nicer than rural, that my parents, well Mom and Richard (who might as well be my father if not my friend) had taken to living in.  The place was a time capsule, a step outside the stream of constantly flowing events that is the rest of the world.  Maybe the Amish had something to do with that.  But I’d be there, and I’d be broke, and hopefully, I’d know something more than I did when I left.   	And the end of the journey, my journey, it hung just out of view, just outside of Lancaster.  It hung on a plane from Philly, it hung on a plane from Atlanta, it hung on a plane from Dallas, and it hung on a touch down in Austin.  It hung, and I could almost touch it, and I might have reached for it if I wasn’t so damned determine to see what existed in the middle, in the mean-time; I wanted to know what my adventure would be like.  I wanted to know what I’d be doing when I was away, visiting poor old Mr. Bunbury.  For that’s what I was doing, wasn’t I?  I was Bunburying, visiting a sick old man that didn’t existing, making excuses so that I could be somewhere else, be someone else.  Be not a soldier, be what I wanted to be, as opposed to who I was, who I am.

      Every time I come here I’m instantly aware that this is most definitely not one of the many houses that I grew up in.  It’s not my home, though it is very much a home.  And this is odd because it is my mother’s house.  I guess it is true, we can never go home again.  You know what I mean.  I moved habitually when I was growing up.  I never went through three grades start to finish in the same school, always trying to stay one step ahead of the debt, the price of pride and four kids on a single mother.   She refused hand outs, she refused to quit, always looking for something better, trying to better us, to make our lives easier.  And they got easier after I moved out, leaving to join the Army and change the world into my world.  Mom finally moved in with her long time boyfriend, taking the rest of my siblings with her, and though it’s always been comfortable when I came home, I’ve always noticed that I don’t have a bed of my own, or a closet, or anywhere to keep the boxes of stuff that are sitting in a storage room.  It’s something that’s contributed greatly to my belief that I’ve just been wandering around these last five years, the realization that most of my ‘stuff’ the anchor of my existence has been in boxes and always a significant distance away. And yet, despite never having lived here, in this house, or even in this state, it is exceedingly comfortable.  The guest bed is nicer than any I’ve slept in for quite a while.  I know my way around.  I know where all the boxes that house my stuff are.  But, in the year that I’ve been away, it’ll be a year tomorrow morning, so I shaved a pair of days off, the house has changed, emphasizing the feeling of unfamiliarity.  Where there was carpet, there’s now hardwood floors; the dishwasher has been replaced; walls are painted; shelves appeared where none were before; there’s a hardwood shed in the backyard; a new truck in the driveway; and on and on and on.  And one of the other changes, for another year, I’ll be leaving on the second of June, again.  I left the second of June last year.  Maybe I’ll do it next year, just to maintain the trend.  I don’t know, I don’t think that far ahead.   These last few days I haven’t been thinking that far ahead.  But I’ve been working diligently at this being alive thing.  Time in the city, time in Vancouver, time in the air.  Lots of time, all written down and experienced, so that when I get back to Texas tomorrow I can type it all out, work it all out, and display it all, my North American Bohemian Tour, or as I’m tentatively calling it,  Bunburying .  I figure I’ve got enough there, where, with a few more crazy vacations, I might be able to work a short novel out of it, something like a jet-setting  On The Road .  I think it would be an apt tribute, I’ve been finding a great deal of people who think along the say paths, if not the same principles of the Beat Generation.  It’s probably time that the rest of the world realizes where not the MTV generation, we’ve got our own voice and it has nothing to do with TRL.

      Yesterday morning, early, sometime around 4, sober and tired, I stumbled up the stairs to my room.  All I wanted to do was sleep, and yet that little writer tick in my head had other ideas.  One other idea, actually.  The funny thing, was that I kept thinking that predawn July, at home and fed at my parents' home was no time to be lamenting.  Add to that, I don't really have a person to lament.  I've had a string, hell, a lifetime of 23 years, worth of more bad than good relationships, and yet I've lost that one true lament.  Maybe it's a sign that I've become to cynical, if that's even possible for a writer.  But, so, there I was in bed with this sense of lament in my mind, and I knocked out this poem.  Only after that, and, well, this rather lengthy introduction, could I sleep.  That was twenty hours ago.  And now, here for your enjoyment, is my poem.            <> Cold December Mornings Are Out Of Season in July        <>I’m getting better at getting over;  Moving along nicely towards moving on.   I think you’d be pleased to know  That I finally got around to                Fixing flaws and patching holes.  Yeah, that’s right.  I’m finally crossing things off  Your Tolstoy-length list of  Honey-Do-Self-Improvements,  The same ones you quoted in your letter  Like a   Mississippi   preacher from the   Good book.  Back when times-  Well, they weren’t so good, but  We had our laughs, and we  Had our tears and now…  Well, I keep looking over my shoulder,  Just hoping to see you standing there,  To see you seeing me, to see  Me moving forward.  I’ve got promise, promise I do.  And thoughts like this are better saved  For Thursday Mornings in December-  They’re just so damn out of season in July.  From my bed it’s hard to turn.  Oh, believe me, I do  Just to find an empty mattress.  And I’m supposed to see potential  Where nothing lays to block my path.  But objects at rest and so forth.  I’ve got promise, promise I do.  And thoughts like this one are better saved  For Thursday mornings in December  They’re just so damn out of season in July.

      Looking For Motivation       I should be working right now, should be hammering out my second novel.    It’s night time, I’m on my third absinthe, and I’ve gone and edited the first 23k words that I’ve gotten written.    Most people are hard pressed to write 23k words, me I’m just hard pressed to move beyond them.    See, I’m at a delicate point right now, two delicate points actually, being that this story is split into two parts, the beginning and the end told simultaneously.    In the early portion, I’m at the point where the bird is ready to leave the nest and to fill his world with the delusions that will be his downfall and lead into the end.    In the end I’m at the point where the protagonist is confronting a false god, so to say, and forced to realize that no one else will save his soul.    Take that, Jewel!      I’m currently looking for excuses, reasons why my motivation isn’t flowing.    One of the strongest is that every time I start to get going, I have to stop to go outside and smoke.    It’s a big drag to get up, go down stairs, put some sort of footwear on (I’ve got a pair of Kung Fu slippers for just such occasions) and smoke, where just two weeks ago, I could take that smoke break at my computer, in my room, and present my problems from a step away instead of three dozen steps.    Maybe if the book was bigger I’d be able to see it from that far.    But, now I’m off to take those steps again, and I’m going to come back, and I’m going to sit at the computer, and I’m going to knock out at least 2k words tonight.    Why?    Because I can’t stand to tell people I’m twenty three thousand words in, when I could say that I was twenty five thousand words in.    That, and I figure if I knock out another two thousand words, that’ll finish chapter five.    Five chapters!    That’s a quarter of the way there!    And in the words of Dean Martin, I leave you.       “You’re goddamn right!”

         Now, I’m not the type that typically watched Hollywood movies, not that I’m a film snob, I don’t watch art films purely because they are art films, or detest Hollywood for being a money machine, rather I’ve found that most Hollywood films are utterly predictable.    I’ve been known to say lines verbatim before the actor, plot twists come across as convenient and tried as the formula they were pulled from.    But, tonight being Friday, and in an attempt to form some sort of life out of the holding pattern I’ve been handed, I thought it would be a good idea to go to the theatre tonight.     Flashback to around 1993.    I was in seventh or eight grade, I was still on speaking terms with my father.    He had a habit of going to thrift stores, it was like “yard sale-ing” only without actually having to look for a sale.    It was weekend visitation time, and myself, my siblings, and my father found ourselves in one thrift store or another in the thinly lain urban sprawl that is the dying   Virginia   ends of   Washington   DC  .    I’m combing through the book section while my father was combing through records of furniture and the remainder of the kids are off running amuck.    I find the biggest book I can, hard copy,  The Bourne Ultimatum .    The cover had a spiral sea shell with a railroad spike through it.    To the mind of a fourteen year old, this was what adults read, and dammit if I didn’t want to be one.    It cost me something like a dollar and a quarter.    I picked it up, and I was instantly hooked.         Now, today I rarely read modern literature, much for the same reason I don’t want  Hollywood  movies, but this story is the exception that exists for every rule, and this is my exception to my own rule.     Ultimatum  blew me away.    It was spies.    It was old spies who were passed their game and trying to kill each other.    I was hooked.    I wanted to be an old spy.    I wanted that pain in my life, that haunting that was more real than the duende that seemed all too real.    I wanted a human threat.         Flash forward to the spring of 2001.    Joey McK  ay  .    It was an incredibly productive time for me.    The heartache was real, I was letting go of a love that had let go of me a few years prior.    I had sat back with tears that refused to be born as my unit went to Kosovo without me.    I had missed out on my slot to sniper school on account of going to be a better place –  West Point .    Only I wasn’t there yet, and I wasn’t in Kosovo, and I was stuck in a stuffy, hot, humid guard shack in   Georgia  .    I’d been wandering through the remarkably small book section of the PX and picked up a few books; three books,  The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy,  and another copy of  The Bourne Ultimatum .    The only thing that was on television in the shack was the College Women’s Softball World Series, now as spellbinding as that programming is to a twenty year old male, both Joey and I plowed through the trilogy in the week we were in that shack.        Bourne Identity  ranked as one of the most compelling reads I’d ever lain my hands on.    Ludlum, my his soul rest, made Clancy look like a school girl (and not one of those clever catholic ones either, we’re talking public school here).    He knew his stuff, or he knew enough to fake it.    And what really got me were the characters, Jason Bourne was haunted, he wasn’t young, but he wasn’t old.    You couldn’t tell it by looking at his soul though.    He was alone, he was lost, and he was skilled.    Add to that he was putting together pieces of a puzzle and he wasn’t liking the picture that was coming out.    And it all had something to do with a man named  urlLink Carlos the Jackal .         I could go on and on, but I’ll save us all the time.    I loved the first book, ranking it as equal or better than the third, the one that had gotten the whole love affair started.     Supremacy  was good, but not that good.    There was no Carlos in it.    And the third, well,  Ultimatum  served to tie everything up, the final tango of two greats in their field.    What happens when gods collide?    Worlds shake.         Fast forward a year, early summer 2002,  The Bourne Identity  hits theatres.    Matt Damon, a remarkably sensitive actor has the title role.    Granted, the setting has been moved up thirty years, which takes a great deal of skill, considering a great deal of who Bourne was came from years forged in fire during   Vietnam  .    Another major factor is no longer applicable, for Bourne to exist in 2002, he could not have been combating the Soviets for the CIA, he was too young, and he could not have been an anti-terror agent, for that open war was still in its infancy.    Obviously the screenwriter / adapter had his job cut out for him if he was going to stay true to the book and characters that I knew and loved.          urlLink Tony Gilroy  failed.    Bourne was an assassin purely to kill, no overriding mission, no real glimpse into any background.    The good doctor Mo was missing.    Alex was a minor character.    Marie, the female lead was not an economist from   Canada   who was an unwitting hostage of one Jason Bourne, but rather a paid driver who somehow fell for him.    I won’t spoil why she falls for him in the book, but it’s much more believable.    And of course, the single greatest (albeit one of the smallest roles actually present in the book) character, the leading motivation as to what Jason Bourne is, Carlos the Jackal, was completely missing from the movie.    Now, I ask you, how, in good faith, do you cut out the antagonist?        So, all that being said, I feel I had an understandable beef with the first movie.     Enter today,  Friday  23 July, 2004 .    Nationwide  urlLink  The Bourne Supremacy   premieres.    And of course, as some sort of glutton for punishment, I was there at the theatre with a ticket in my hand.    I knew I was going to watch it as soon as I knew I was going to the theatre. Why?    Because you don’t stop in town and not visit the girl you were engaged to.    Yes, you know it’s going to hurt.    You’re going to be there, you’re going to see her with her happy husband and wonderful children and you’re going to wonder.    And you’re going to walk into that theatre and you’re going to sit down, and you’re going to wonder what could have happened if Tony Gilroy had actually adapted the first film from the book, instead of keeping a few names and a couple of events and throwing the rest into the can.      Tony Gilroy saves his own ass this time.    The film doesn’t even attempt to follow the second book, save for an assassin that posed as Bourne.    Hence the title, the Bourne Supremacy, which Bourne is the better Bourne?    In the book, it’s an actual upstart, picking up when Bourne had dropped off the radar with his wife Marie.    In the movie, it’s an attempt to start a ghost chase, or to wrap up loose ends, which ever happens to be more convenient for those involved.         I’m not going to include any spoilers in here.    Frankly, because I actually liked the movie.    Granted,  Supremacy  was my least favorite of the three books (No Carlos?!) but the movie was remarkably better than the first.    It’s one of those rare situations where the sequel actually topped the original.    Of course, from where I was sitting, the original hadn’t set the bar too terribly high.    But Supremacy has some gutsy story telling, betrays some things, downright throws pain into the face of the audience, the direction is enough to induce vomiting from motion sickness, and had the theatre been slightly louder would have been an almost adequate simulation of combat.    It’s not real, but it’s raw, and I’m now itching for the final chapter, to see where Tony Gilroy allows this to go.    They never showed a certain death, and several opportunities and a very interesting relationship is sparked at the end of the picture.    Well worth watching, and in two years, hopefully I’ll be able to find peace again.

      I got one of those emails this morning, the kind of email that as a writer you never want to get, and no matter how much you prepare yourself, you're never quite prepared to recieve.  It was from my agent, and it was far too early, a few minutes shy of noon, to deal with.  The first push, as he refered to it, of my manuscript to agents had finally garnered all the responeses that were expected.  And of course, they were polite responses such as:     Thanks for submitting your manuscript to me. It is a pass for me.      And     We have read your material and enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, it is not a piece that we would be able to pursue at this point in time.     My agent even going as far as to point out that -   I really do try to dig in and get feedback.  It's an uncomfortable phone call.  Just like all of us, they don't like to say "no", and believe me they have to say it all too often.

      Here and gone, so I know.  It's been sometime since I've last posted, and a great deal has happened between then and now.  The largest, of course, being getting out of the military.  It was a down to the wire race, let me tell you that.  Numerous tragedies cropped up at my every attempt to simply break out of one world and into another.  At every step I was pushed to, and sometimes beyond the realm of my own patience.  A day did not go by in which I didn't threaten arson or death, sometimes in conjunction.  And yet, despite problems cropping up at every moment up to my very last day in uniform, I still somehow managed to overcome, be it a total mystery to me, and escaped from Austin on Thursday 15, July.  The importance of this date is amplified when noted that on 15 July 2003, I flew out to Iraq.  It should have added to the closure, making things easier.  But, for some reason, a year prior I had a much better flight, when destinations weren't taken into account.  I made the mistake of flying United.  That was the last time I'll ever do that.  Flying United was something akin to the human cattle cars employeed by the Nazis, but with a beverage service.  On top of that, they lost my luggage.    But all that is behind me, and a rant that I included mid-flight into the continuing of my Bunburying writing.    It's because of the Bunburying writing that I haven't been posting to here.  I expected things to flow much faster than they have been.  I have no idea when I'm going anywhere, and my mother is urging me to make plans, to figure something out.  Unfortunately, my business partner is out of the country, still in Jordan, and is apparently getting married towards to the middle of next month.  Where this leaves me, I have no idea.  But, time is oh so good at telling, it's one of the very few things that time is actually good at.

      A return to bohemia, or perhaps a headstart today.  I woke up early this morning, needing a cigarette and like usually, checked up on the internet sites that seem to have taken over my life.  One such sites,  urlLink Orkut  posed the question in a Bohemian group, as to what our personal definition of 'bohemian' is.  And well, that's a question I've been wrestling with since before I started to pen  urlLink A Life Sentence  .  In A Life Sentence, I purposefully made several characters archetypal so that I could show different aspects of being a bohemain, and I specifically left the majority of what being a bohemian is between the lines.  But, this morning, I screwed the lines, and just went ahead and said it.  And here, for your reading benefit, is my essay.  Art and the Establishment  	So what’s a bohemian?  Since the dictionary definitions have already been drawn up, thank you, Mish, so I’ll start there.  Following the process of elimination, I don’t think it’s fair to draw upon the first definition, being that country (really a principality) of Bohemia was rolled over by several empires – the first being the Holy Roman (an empire in name only) and then swallowed consecutively by the Austrian-Hungarian empire, and then “Communism”.  So, I don’t think I could use the first definition, being that there hasn’t really been an official Bohemian by definition number one in my lifetime.  Of all the Czech’s I know, they all speech Czech, thanks in part to Hammer and Sickle crushing local languages in order to enforce equality amongst its… participants.  Two’s down.  That leaves us with three, and the third definition is both the one I align my view closest with, and that which the casual English speaker seems to as well. 	Close, but no cigar.    • An artisan, usually gifted in literature or the creative arts; one who defies social conventions; a gypsy.  I’ve been digging into the concept of being a bohemian for some time now, even though I never tried to do this, to write up a treatise of what I thought a bohemian was.  What is bohemian to me?  I went as far as to write a novel about it (email me if you want a copy) and included a group which the protagonist refers to simply as ‘The Bohemians’.  Consider yourself forewarned, I’m longwinded.  Here’s where my personal definition, which I’m by no means claiming to be the standard, differs from Webster’s.  First off, a bohemian doesn’t necessarily have to be an artist, merely someone who appreciates the arts.  I can’t paint or sculpt, but I still enjoy them, and I can still hope to see the message that the artist was conveying.  I can’t sing a lick, nor play any instrument, but I’m still moved by the songs of others.  I’m a writer, but I still read what others write, and marvel at their own personal style and voice.    As far as defying social conventions go, I believe bohemians do that, but for other reasons than merely defying them.  Rebelling simply to rebel strikes me too much as something Brando would do.  Instead, I see a bohemian as slightly more focused, as being more anti-Establishment.  A bohemian artist is fighting against something, driven by some sort of a purpose – the musician is making music that is blatantly not mainstream, the painter is working on works that go against the accepted, the actor is dealing with characters in such a manner and such a tone as to stand out, not as a showboat, but as a completely different and unexpected performance.   From my soapbox, the artistic community that is viewed as ‘popular art’ – that is, art that is readily accepted by the mainstream is both nonchallenging and controlled by people who are not themselves the slight bit artistic.  Today, especially so, we have more artistic means available to us than at anytime before thanks in large to the internet and the interconnected nature of our lives.  Bohemians have more mediums than ever, and much more of a voice now.   Art now includes the traditionals – literature, music, painting, sculpting, drawing, performance, and photography – but the newer forms of acting, movie making, and the entire digital world of blogs, FLASH films…anything that a person can dream up save for the physical interaction can be displayed and performed over the internet.    The third, and final aspect of my definition of a bohemian, is that it is idealistically doomed.  With the current state of mainstream ‘pop’ art, the bohemian fighting for a change is only happy when running up against the brick wall of failure time and time again.  It ranks up there with the concept of honorable death, a concept that doesn’t exist outside of the twin realms of art and the youthful mind.  Bohemians realize that the pop art world is wrong, but have the fortitude to slug out an impossible fight for sometime.  It’s a validation, a series of scars, a battle record.  Maybe it’s knowing that for once, you were right and the whole world was wrong, and you still got screwed.  Perhaps that feeling makes failure in the future that much easier.  There’s something to be said for giving it your all and still coming up short.  After all, how many people have ever given something their all?  For this reason, bohemians typically tend to be the youths.  Because we, the youth, are the idealists.  The real world has a wicked track record of dealing with ideals.    All that being said, I believe that music is the most accessible modern source of bohemians because music is perhaps the most readily accessible form or modern art.   The American society, the National Endowment for the Arts, released a study in the past few days saying that Americans read far less than they used to.  A dramatic decrease in reading lines right up with the rise of the internet, the drop taking a major turn for the worse from 1992 to 2002, when the internet worked its way into the majority of, at least American, homes.  That, of course, is terrible news for those of us who want more than anything else, to make a living by writing.  But, music and movies have instead moved into a golden age, not yet noted, but surely one that will be.  Now, more than ever, music and film are readily available, and on a much broader, more open means than at any other time in history.  Today you can download a song from a band your friend told you about in less than thirty seconds.  I can grab the remote control for my computer and legally download a movie thanks to digital pay-per-view in less than twenty minutes.  I can start viewing it after as little as two minutes.  Music more so than movies, are a direct realization of the artist.  Where a movie is much more of a joint feature, a screenplay written by one person, interpreted by a crew of actors, and realized by a team of directors and producers, a song is (usually) written and performed by a much smaller group.  The musician has a great deal more creative control over their own art than someone in the movie industry (Indie films aside).    I’m hoping beyond hope that the internet changes all of that, I’m hoping that the internet is the means by which the artist regains control over the business of his or her own art.  Thanks to the internet I’ve been able to listen to artists that I would have never otherwise heard.  Thanks to the internet I’ve seen movies that were unavailable to me.  Thanks to the internet I’ve been able to connect with fellow artists in places I’ve never been.  Granted, the internet isn’t the only means I’ve met people.  Sitting outside of a café in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, I met a documentary maker named Flavia and have learned a great deal about documentaries from her.  I’ve sat in a bar in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and met people who were so bohemian that they didn’t know it.  But, thanks to the internet, I’ve had a correspondence with an old bohemian, a remnant of the sixties, a surviving member of the latter days of the beat generation known as Slow Tony, the only identifiable face on  urlLink Bohemian.org .  And from here, up on my soap box, it seems time to unite the starving artists of the world, to give birth to a focal point, where those who don’t know they are bohemians, and those with whom that word has always struck a nerve, to come together, to unite and distribute and contribute.  My book hasn’t been picked up by a publisher yet, but thanks to the internet you can read it.  Your poetry might be sitting handwritten in a soft-suede covered journal next to your bed, but thanks to the internet I can read it. You can publish your thoughts and takes in a blog (mines already half as long as my first novel) and you can push your music out onto a peer-to-peer network.  I’ve even met a very talented painter from Finland thanks to the internet.  All we need now is a rallying point, a flag to be waved, a centre of gravity so strong that we pull other artists in, and we welcome them.  But, that’s the view from my soap box.     I could have gone on.  I've done a lot of reading into the history of being a bohemian, even gone as far as to draw up a timeline of modern bohemian history.  But, I didn't.  I'm waiting for the bohemian revolution.  Right now I'm focusing more on my own career, my own personal bohemian quest.  Right now I'm dealing with my own ideals, working on my second novel, working on various screenplay edits.  Why?  Because I'm hoping that if I get inside the system, I can use it to broadcast, to reach out and find others, to draw them to the very bohemian flag that I mentioned in my essay.  Any who are reading this, and are interested in taking their own quest for art and truth further, email me for an Orkut invite, or surf over to  urlLink New Bohemians  and check the page out.  But for now, I've got work to do.

      Tonight turned out to be a night for writing.  I didn’t think it would be, not this close to the end, but the whiskey came out, the smokes seemed to light themselves, and now I’m here again, aren’t I?   For someone who’s moved as much as I have, you’d think I’d have gotten used to it by now.  For the past few years I haven’t been able to fully spread my wings, my roots have yet to do more than merely touch the soil.  Even when it looked like I would be in one place for any significant amount of time, things would change as things are so apt to do, and I would end up packing up and moving on.  And as much as I dream of freedom, as much as I talk about moving on and moving forward, and seeing new things, the concept of freedom always remaining out there, if only just over the horizon where the grass truly is greener.   The threat of moving is almost enough to make me want to settle for the mediocre.  I’m willing to settle for permanence of any real sort, anything tangible, anything that I can touch and feel and hold and even if it has flaws and cracks, at least it would be real and at least it would be mine.   We had one hell of a summer shower today, the kind where the sun is still out and the rain is coming down by the bucketful, as if even the world, the inherent nature of everything was undecided, mixed up.  Or perhaps I’m just reaching out and putting my own feelings on the world, like a glove, or a mask, or glaucoma.    Regardless, you’d think I’d be immune to moving on by now.  I’ve done numerous times, more times than I care to remember.  It’s humbling, packing up your worldly goods into brown boxes, taping them shut.  Throwing out things you realize you don’t need, things you probably shouldn’t have kept but for some reason that might have existed at one point, did.  It’s odd to find things you borrowed from others, that haven’t been missed, and then returning them.  It’s oddly sickening, like a drink that just doesn’t sit well, and vomiting isn’t an option, won’t make things better.  The whole experience is oddly draining.  I did absolutely nothing today.  Skipped out on work, didn’t work at all on the rapidly mounting list of tasks I’ve yet to do in order to get out of here on time.  I mulled around my room, swimming from one internet site to the next, knocking out a roughly 750 word essay on the benefits of complaining as a means to tie together people, as a source of bonding.  The essay, titled Something more than Corporate, the title being a link to the question’s poser, having to do with corporate entities.  Just for the sake of posting, here’s my response:  It is with great pride that I can say I’ve worked with some of the best complainers that America has to offer.  Please do note, that they were usually not complaining without provocation, for I have also accompanied them to some of the worst places that America sends its sons and daughters.  That’s the part that the recruiters don’t tell you about. During my time as a soldier I’ve often noticed that not only complaining but terrible circumstances tend to build far better bonds than good times and success due.  Here’s why – greed in its slick way, wants success to be an individual event.  We all want to be the rock star, the movie star, the brilliant novelist, the star in our own field, and we want that success to be our own, so that no one can challenge it.  Perhaps it’s only so we can find that it is indeed lonely at the top.   And contrary to the literary definition of tragedy, where the characters are isolated at the finish, actual tragedy has a way of uniting, even if the tragedy is something as simple a death in the family (simple because everyone does it, eventually).  I’m fairly certain that’s why funerals are group events.   We all suffer.  Suffering is part of life.  Suffering is the first Noble Truth in Buddhism.  The problem with suffering is very similar to the problem of other people thinking.  You never see other people think, you only see the results of their thoughts.  Other people are characters of action.  The same concept is easily shifted to suffering.  We don’t see other people grasping to deal with the same pain we are, we only see the outward manifestations of their suffering, if we are even present for the event at all.  But, when we all suffer together, it is a giant step easier to understand the pain that another is enduring.  The end result also seeks to strengthen bonds, our own fragile nature is so evident to ourselves, and thus we are somewhat more aware of the fragile nature of others.  By enduring a common sense of suffering, we are able to see others struggle on, most certainly going through what we ourselves were struggling to endure.  It is an increase in empathy.   Complaining is just a finer example of this.  Complaining is just a means of alerting another to the inherent tragedy of our current situation, a means to seek that suffering in an open and lesser sense of the word.  But it’s not the complaint that is important, nor is it event in which the protesting complaint was launched, but rather the acknowledgment and return complaint of another.  If a gripe is launched, and a co-worker refuses to gripe in return, rather ordering you to simply carry on, a sense of communion is lost.  Odds are you would carry on just the same, but had that co-worker launched a similar gripe, or merely a word or two of agreement, then you’d be carrying on with a brethren spirit, as opposed to the inherently lonely status that is our world.   Of course, that being said, people do complain far too much about far too little.  But suffering is an important part of human existence.  W.H. Auden postulated that the child is looking for the defining traumatic event that separates childhood from adulthood.  If a tragedy is averted, we must continue to look for another until we find one that justifies our existence, our personal scar that proves that we actual do exist.   The bonds of association are often a very funny thing.  The Army, a society of inherent familiarity for me, is a series of circles.  To use the Infantry as an example, a soldier’s position is inherently realized.  Families are clearly identifiable.  And its those families that are used to relate to.  I might not like being in my fire team (a four man unit, two per squad), but if you have something to say about my fire team, than you have something to say against my family, and thus me.  If you have something against my squad (a nine man unit consisting of two fire teams, four squads per platoon) and you are not a member, than you have something to say against me.  The entire system continues upwards, with the lowest common denominator being the inherent strongest bond.  This goes back to the realization of suffering.  My fire team / squad / platoon / company had endured what I have endured, and if you are not a member, you have not done what I have, and thus have not suffered like I have, and being so, have no right to criticize.  It’s very easy to transfer this to other situations.  I can call my sister fat, but let’s hope for your sake that you don’t make that mistake.  I can gripe about my corporation because it’s mine, regardless of my position, but you, an outsider, have no such right.     I’m so close to the end that I feel I need to leave my mark.  As if everything I’ve done here will not matter, and it’s what I do now that people will truly remember me by.  I saw a book the other day, when Dan and I had declared war on the life, the universe, and everything.  The book was of last words; not the final words in books, or the last lines in a poem, but the dying words of individuals.  Bogart said, “I should have switched from scotch to martinis.”  Wilde reportedly said, “Either that wall paper goes, or I do.” Or some witty derivative thereof.  Me, I’ve joked recently that my dying words would be “Remarks complete.”  Anyone who’s slaved through a military parade has heard those words countless times – they’re read during a practice, taking the place of a speech, and as you stand there doing your damnedest to stand perfectly still, those words have a haunting value, they seem to both last forever, and to threaten to last even longer than forever the next day, or whenever the parade is to actually take place.  They are substitute words, taking the place of something that has meaning to the speaker, but everyone else seems to be listening to without caring, merely out of some sort of forced respect.   I don’t want my dying words to be remarks complete.  I have no idea what I want them to be, but right now I’m staring them down, as if in the next week, for a week from right now I’ll be failing to sleeping, knowing full and well I’m walking away again in the morning.  And in this next week, there’ll be plenty of goodbyes, and I should take comfort in that, because that means I did what I was supposed to, I mattered to others, but it also is painful, because I know that realistically, I’ll never see these people again.  And that’s not where the pain comes from, I’ve walked away from a lot of people I cared a great deal about before – I am the King of Burning Bridges – no, the pain comes from the fact that I suffered with these people.  I sweated, I was scared with these people.  I was willing to act without thought for myself with these people.  I loved these people.  And say what you will about the military, the men I went to war with, the ones who I stuck my neck out on the line with, our heads all there together on the chopping block, that was a very deep, very profound sense, and I’ve yet to come up with a better word for it than love.  And I know that some of them I’ll never walk away from.  Even if not walking away means a call on Christmas, an occasional drink between flights, a stop on a car trip.  I know that when I say, “If you need anything, call me, write, get a hold of me,” that those words are some of the truest words I’ll ever stumble across.  And for someone who seeks to find truth in words, to write them, to show them to the entire world so that maybe someone else can seek to find truth, it’s a lot like reaching the pinnacle and then having to stare at the long walk down.  It’s a lot like realizing the dream wasn’t as good as it seemed while you were asleep.  It’s the pure stuff, and I know I’ll spend a long time looking for it again.

      Sleep tonight is simply not forthcoming.  I can’t do it, don’t know why.  I’m not even tired.  It’s a stark and frightening contrast to the vast amount of sleep I’ve been getting lately.  This weekend has spanned the bizarre.  I have discovered perhaps the weirdest situation I’ve ever encountered, to wake up in a drunken near-stupor only to discover my little concrete reinforced hole in the wall room is completely dark and the entire world is still, silent.  Waking up drunk and disoriented, sweating to the bone, in the middle of an incredibly lengthy power outage is harrowing experience, and an incredibly harrowing and humanizing experience, especially when paired with the task of attempting to hold yourself upright with one hand on a moving door, while the other is blindly fumbling for a light switch, failing to realize why the lights won’t come on and hoping that whatever is forcing its way up from your stomach is landing somewhere within the vicinity of the toilet.   But that’s not the greatest of my news.  My computer is at least once again in a state of connected success.  Thanks to the help of a friend, the process of elimination, and the ability of Windows XP to allow another user to control your machine regardless of distance.  So I felt better about that. I woke up this morning hungover, smelling horribly, and clearly able to point out just when last night shifted from writing some marvelous stuff for my second novel into a drunken escapade that involved me killing the last third of a bottle of bourbon and decimating a pack of smokes in something close to two hours.  Dan woke me up Monday morning, thankfully a holiday, and we ended up going out to get something to eat, the first for either of us, sometime around two.  Just prior to going out, I cranked out this poem,   Post-Bohemian Experience Separation Anxiety   I sat inside today. The lights were off, The stereo was a dull roar. Poetry in lyrical form did its best To keep the party going. And me, I just wondered, “How bad will the sunlight be?” It’s our enemy. You know that, right? The sun refuses to hide the lies, That liquor and smoke Really do make real boys Out of wooden dummies.  And daylight truly was an enemy, and still is, as I’m getting myself ready to transition back to a nocturnal existence.  I don’t know why, I do my best work at night, after the day has already assailed me.  Around 14 months ago, I was staying at my parent’s house in scenic and oh so quaintly rustic Lancaster Pennsylvania, the Amish capital of the world.  I discovered my pattern then, between avoiding contact with K, I’d wake up around one or so, lift weight, tune into MSNBC, track the market until close, eat dinner with the family, settle in front of the television, start drinking, around eleven or so I’d start on the liquor, and make my way to the computer.   I’d write for hours, go to bed sometime close to when the sun was coming up, and get up around one or so to do the whole thing over again.  I knocked out an entire screenplay in three weeks this way.  I’m sure I could have done it sooner if a) there was more liquor in the house and b) I was allowed to smoke in my room.  But, they were the most favorable circumstances I’ve yet encountered for writing, and because that is the path that I’m embarking on in just a few short days, I seem to be readying myself to return to them.  Because I work in this manner, sunlight is the enemy.   Dan and I disappeared all the way to Round Rock so that we could go to Barnes and Nobel.  We drove for over an hour just to go to a bookstore.  That’s the way things are done in Texas.  The gloves were off for both of us.  No one was safe today.  It’s as if we’ve declared war on the entire rest of the world.  Not that we’re outwardly rude, but that we have little to no care for things that don’t make sense to us.  I haven’t been this way for a very long time.  We raised a good bit of hell today in a Walmart.  We were a ruckus with a shopping cart as I picked out groceries.  I’m not going to be able to eat the mess hall for much longer, not that I do now, but I need to have food in the room.   N’s coming down tomorrow.  It’ll be the first time I’ve seen her since last May when I made a stop up at West Point to drop off a copy of a screenplay and to sit over coffee.  It was raining that night and I was walking.  I got stuck just off post, Jordan not being able to drive across the river and pick me up. I ended up crashing in a hotel room.  I write a lot in hotel rooms, but I didn’t have anything to write with, so I just lay in bed and smoked cigarettes.  I write a lot on trains too.  I think it’s the impermanence of the locations, I know when I’m in a hotel or on a train, in a plane, going somewhere that I won’t be there for long at all, and while I’m there I might as well make the best of the situation.  Maybe that’s what gripping me now.  This place, Texas, is soon to be gone for me.  Soon to be over with.   We were sitting in Whataburger today, and remarking on the flaws of the world.  Written in blue on the largely orange and white cups are the words ‘When I am empty please dispose of me properly’ but for some reason, at a glance, perhaps because I wanted it to be something meaningful, I didn’t see those words, I saw ‘Where I am exists because I believe.’  How on Earth I got those words off a cup, out of a pseudo-kind reminder to not litter, I’ll never know.  But I did.   Where I am exists because I believe.  Food for thought.  It turned out to be one hell of a weekend. Where I am exists because I believe.  Where am I?

      There has got to be some reasonable explanation for why bad things seem to group together.  And I'd like someone, anyone really, to come forward with it, and it has to be more concrete than 'Misery loves company' and more logically than what I used to tell Ben..."Bad things happen to guys named Ben."   So, here's the dice.  The Department of Homeland Security, the American organization with no real authority, essentially national advisors dedicated to keeping the homeland safe, as oxymoronic as that sounds, it's horribly true, came out with a statement saying that Internet Explorer is a risk and should not be used on government computers.  Yikes, says I.  Now, I'd been following the security problems made public concerning IE for some time, you can't miss them, they're all over Wired, Slashdot, and CnEt/ZDnet.  Now, most of these articles, particularly on Slashdot are by Linux users, and most  Linux users go all the way with the Open Source bit and use one form of Mozilla if not all of them.   Are you following me here?  I figured, you know, what the hell, I might as well start to free myself from the borg-like clutch that is Microsoft, and jump to a new web browser.  Mozilla.  Mozilla.   Mozilla.  So, I swung over to  urlLink Mozilla  and downloaded the standard Mozilla browser.  After installation, I figure, give the wheels a spin, and low and behold, it's GRE based, essentially an open source Netscape clone.  Now, ordinarily, this wouldn't bother most, but I'm not a Netscape fan in the slightest, due in large to being forced to use AOL for years as a child.  Ah, the horrors that can come up with a little bit of mental regression.  On top of that, and bear with me here, this is one hell of a mountain, it was barely functioning.  Pages would load without pictures, or pages would fail to load, a window popping up saying that the selected document holds no data.  No data, eh?  It's my email box, there's data there, maybe not pertinent, but it's data, dammit.  So, now, I'm spinning.  So I go ahead and download Mozilla Firefox, figuring it can be one of two things - some completely new browser that I've never seen before, or an IE clone.  Either one would have been great.  Well, I go ahead and install that, and it is an IE clone, and it is suffering from the same problems that Mozilla was!  Pages would load slow and sans artwork, fonts were irregular, pages wouldn't load due to a total lack of data.  Oh, the horror.  You see, I spend a great deal of time on the web, and I've got surfing down to a near art, and it's a minimalist art.  One click and bam! new page.  I'm here, I'm there, I'm outta sight.  Both of my computers exist behind two firewalls, active virus-protection, and Spy-bot.  Not to mention my router acts as a firewall.  And I've got a kill switch.  I like to think I'm a fairly safe surfer.   So, why was I running from a security flaw in IE?  Because I also take care of my finances online: banking, credit cards, and Ameritrade.  Not that I care too much about money, growing up poor I learned quickly that you can always get by, and very often we did, on no money.  So, why was I running?  I kept asking myself that, and I went ahead and punched up IE.  By then it was already too late.  IE was done.  Something that had come on my computer, or died in inside of it, had rendered IE essentially useless.   I could get to base web pages, MSN.com say, but if I wanted to get further, I don't know, to check my hotmail account, I'd get the infamous 'This Page Can Not Be Displayed' page, you know, the one that's been pretty much obsolete since companies started putting generic search engines at digital dead ends.   My internet browsing on my work computer essentially got a major flat tire.  Blow out on the Information Super Highway.  Now, I'm not a man prone to profanity.  I gave it up some time ago, oh, I'll toss about the stuff you can get away with on primetime television, but the big bad ones don't utter themselves from my lips.  But last night I was tempted. Oh, I was so very tempted.  I burned through a pack of cigarettes while attempting to fix the problem, and we've yet to see the top of the mountain.   Ok, so IE is screwed and both Mozilla and Firefox are running half-assed.  What's that leave?  You're damn right, the greatest evil of all the relatives, Netscape.  In my search for a functioning browser I was left with no real option left.  I went and downloaded the update, and started surfing at a clipped pace with Netscape 7.1.  Clipped?  Yeah, more circumcised than anything else.  Granted, the tab window feature if a nice, the ability to browse several pages in the same window, but the bad thing is that pages just wouldn't open.  Frustration is building.  I feel like an ad for Apple Computers.  And my feelings against them are rather strong.   As the internet starts to go, so does the computer.  Rebooting takes it about as long as it takes me to eat a sandwich.  Don't ask how I timed this.  So, I start to do what I've long known how to.  Growing up poor, dealing with second hand technology in every field from audio equipment to computers... my family owned a Tandy with an 80-88...10 MB hard drive! 256kb of RAM!  Our next PC wasn't much better, it was a Compaq, the all inclusive kind, where the CPU and the monitor are the same component.  Yeah, horrible, I know, but in high school my stereo was held together with coat hangers and electrical tape and it still sounded amazing.  So, like I said, I learned at an early age how to deal.   I jumped on my computer.  I defragged.  I removed programs.  I ran the antivirus.  I ran Spy-bot.  (Mozilla puts some interesting tracking cookies on your PC, for those who are interested).  I jumped to MSConfig and started clearing out my Start Up programs.  Great webpage,  urlLink www.windowsstartup.com  lists the functions of nearly every application that Startup runs, so you can decide what you want to remove, and what you really can't.  I dumped all of my games, except for Knight of the Old Republic which won't uninstall for some unknown reason.  I cleared gigs of data from my lap top.  I streamlined it.  Startup time is at an all-time record.  It's gone from sandwich to a barely handled cigarette.   Alas, it was to no avail.  My web browsing was still a very hit or miss experience.  That left me with the second to final option.  System Restore.  At this point it was after midnight, technically passed the cliche eleventh hour.  I was tired, I was sober, I was running out of options.  I restored, moving back twice, once not far enough, and the second time to when I was running only IE.   I held my breath, I opened up IE.  You can hear a heartbreak.  No dice.  Nothing.  I gave up, I went and lied in bed, contemplating what to do.  I've rebuilt hard drives before.  Back when I was in prep school a vicious virus ripped through a lot of our computers, pulled off of Kazaa as best as we could figure.  About a dozen of us spent a weekend reinstalling various operating systems, reinstalling all the programs that you need to have a functioning computer that does things other than compute - Flash, Quicktime, WinAmp.  The only problem is that my computer is a veteran.  That's right, it's been to war.  I purchased it in Iraq and had it shipped out there.  While preparing to leave Iraq I mailed a great deal of my possessions home, doing my best to make the return 'duffle bag shuffle' as easy and light as possible.  In the mail to my parents house went all of the prepackaged software for my laptop - you know, like Windows.  So, were I to use the 'F' word...format, and start from scratch, I'd pretty much reduce my computer to a $1200 paperweight for two weeks until I got back to my parents house.  And then there's the problem of all of my work on here.  Multiple versions of my first novel, the drafts for my second, and several versions of three screenplays, not to mention short stories, essays, poems...  And it's only the second day of a four day weekend. I've still got the rest of today and all of Sunday and Monday before I can distract myself away from the problem.  So, if there's anyone out there with any advice, or answers, I'm still connected on my play computer.  Hook it up.  Unfortunately, I don't like writing on it, it's too big, I'm too disconnected from my words.  But, I'm probably going to have to shift from this computer to that one just to publish this.   Oh, and one last note, I do have an OS on hand...DOS!  And as much as I'd love to run a pure DOS system again, it's on 3.5" discs, and I don't have a single 3.5" drive on either of my computers.  There's a good definition of irony for you.

      So, it's a hair after three in the morning, already muggy and warm in Texas.  Why am I awake?  Because I was right, things are getting intensely stupid around here. I woke up to my phone ringing and it took me some time to realize to even realize what it was, and that it really wasn't my alarm clock.  I then had the joyous task of going door to door in the barracks to wake everyone up for what at most is a drill, what is probably a urinalisis.  I hate it when I'm right about bad feelings.

                       So, in my family we’ve got a rule: no politics at the dinner table.    Now, this is a very important rule, but it’s one rule that we end up breaking we on an almost nightly basis.    See, here’s where the problem comes up, my mother and her boyfriend are very staunch supporters of John Kerry.    Me, I’m not swung either way.    But, I do draw the line at bashing the current President.                   Here’s where I’m coming from on this one.    I became a leader in the Army at technically a very early age.    I was acting as a team leader within my first month out of basic training.    A few months later I was promoted ahead of schedule and given my first official fire team, and I was still a rank shy of what I should have been.    And when I was a young leader I used to get frustrated because there were so many parts of the situation that I simply didn’t know about.    But slowly, I grew to realize which leaders I could trust to properly handle the situations, and which ones simply had gotten their ranks by not screwing up too much, too often.    Think of them as career middle children.    The ones that didn’t stick out too much be it for reasons of excellence or sub-par behavior.                   And then I was selected by my chain of command to attend the   United   States   Military   Academy  .    You know.     West Point .    And in between being a young high speed team leader in the infantry and a young, supposed-to-know-nothing cadet at USMA, I held a couple of higher level positions at West Point Prep.    And that’s where I learned that all too often the higher leaders don’t always know what’s going on, very often they don’t know enough, but that’s why they’re leaders, they make decisions based on the knowledge they are presented with.    It’s great to believe that our leaders have all the answers, but having experienced leadership intimately from both sides of the fence, I understand that they are only as human as you, or I.    I’ve been quoted as saying that “I respect my leaders for their position, but I do not fear them, or put blind faith in them because they put their pants on, one leg at a time, just like me.”    What’s it mean?    We are all human.    We all have our weaknesses, but we put our faith in our leaders, and by electing the people we put our faith in, we engage in a contract with them, to agree to follow their decisions for the duration of their time in office.                       To the next step, a nation at war.    I have the great pride of having witnessed leaders at all levels step up in a time of war.    I have the privilege of serving with three of the greatest company level non-commissioned officers that I’ve ever seen or heard of during my five years in the Army.    During my times over seas, in what we refer to know simply as “over there”, I saw soldiers and leaders of all ranks step up and take control of all situations, most specifically and most honorably, when information was scant.    No one is free from lack of information, we all make uniformed decisions on a regular basis.    Unfortunately, our leaders are put in places where they must make decisions based on the greatest information available at that time.    And from that interpretation decisions must be made, and one can always blame those above them for the lack of information, but eventually we come to one man – the president.    And he bears upon his shoulders the weight of the nation, and given the current state of geo-political affairs, the world.    The President has no one higher to blame, come the end of his term, everything he’s done is magnified, turning mole hills into mountains.                   So, what is the current criticism of the President?    Well, it’s fueled by three letters WMD, a place,   Iraq  , and a man, Michael Moore.    What’s the beef?    So, I’ll work them in that order.    WMDs – Weapons of Mass Destruction – the largest, unarguably, stated reason for going to war with   Iraq  .    And guess what, they haven’t been found… or rather, they haven’t been reported yet.    October of even years often brings many surprises.    Did I see WMDs myself?    Nope.    Didn’t have that one.    Do I know people who did?    Damn right I do.    It was a popular topic in   Qatar   when I was on my few days of R&R down there.    So, either several soldiers that I happened to run into or knew were wrong / misinformed as to what they were guarding, or the President is waiting to release the information.    The most honorable of intentions?    Certainly not.    But, take into account, several things should be considered – under the pressure to find a smoking gun, the president might have been waiting to find enough chemical weapons (for that was the variety of WMDs I was told people had found) to sate the critics.    I can foresee three reasons for this – 1 – enough weapons were found, but releasing said information would have only raised server criticism from detractors as to why the information hadn’t been released earlier; 2 – not enough were found to substantiate the pre-war intelligence, and thus releasing the information would have only thrown the proverbial gas on the flames; 3 – Enough were found to justify the war, and the President’s campaign is waiting until a time closer to the election to release the news, robbing the other candidates (Nader’s still running) of time to readjust their strategies, leaving the incumbent the only candidate with issues that are suddenly pertinent.                       That brings us to   Iraq  .    Yup, 900+ casualties so far.    And that’s a lot of dead soldiers, more than would have died during normal peace time, but danger is part of being a soldier.    As is going to war.    The first thing to consider is that the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines currently serving are not drafties.    True, when you’re under a stop loss of a stop movement it might feel like it, I know I certainly felt like one (scroll through the rest of this blog for proof of that one), but when we all stood there, and we all raised our hands and we all promised to uphold the orders of the President.    Understood in that was war was inherent.    That is why we are called warriors, we make war.    It’s what we do, it’s part of the job.    Harsh?    You bet.    But, it’s the truth.    My parents often bring up the fact that no one signed up to go to war, but anyone who signs up under the belief that they won’t go to war, we’ll they lost their gamble.    Next, the sheer number of casualties, 900+, seems like a lot.    And given the number alone, it is, but let’s look at it subjectively.    We’ve had less than a thousand Americans die in   Iraq  , a nation at war, where as several thousands died in automobile accidents.    These Americans didn’t agree to risk their lives, they were just trying to get from A to B.    Now, more Americans were killed this last year by fellow Americans, here at home, than were killed at war.    Statistically,   Iraq   is one of the safest places to be an American right now.                   And the last, Michael Moore.    Granted, the media is rapidly going the way of reality television.    In this game, it’s all about ratings.    If it bleeds, it leads.    News Media is now to the point where it can edit and slant stories – case in point – Fox News, as soon as they are filmed.    News has stopped being the source of information that it should be, and has become the source of entertainment that some people saw it had the potential of becoming.    And, a lot of people have thankfully keyed in on this.    And along comes Michael Moore.      Moore   makes a movie, which was scripted as much as this season’s Real World, and equally as realistic.    The problem is the movie isn’t being touted as a work of fiction, but rather as a work of fact, a documentary.    And that’s the way the general population is receiving it, and what truly bothers me is that their believing it.    Honest, hard working people are being cheated by an aspect of reality, a slant on a slant, a Xerox of a Xerox.    Here’s the problem with Mr. Moore’s film.    He took nearly two years to assemble footage and pick a fight relying on hind-sight to improve his vision.    And he did an impressive job of it, don’t read that as a good job, merely an impressive one, filled with the whizzes and the bangs that grab the attentions of the viewers, drawing back defenses and allowing him to slip in all sorts of rhetorical fallacies.    But don’t take my word on it, Chris Hitchens, a writer for Slate Magazine, took the effort to counter all of Mr. Moore’s ‘points’ addressed.    For those interested in reading the article, here’s a link  urlLink Unfairenheit 9/11 .    Oh, and Mr. Hitchens’ rebuttal came out quite a bit faster than the nearly two years Mr. Moore took to assemble his argument.    But, Mr. Moore didn’t merely present his argument and let it lay, waiting for of course, the ‘right’ to respond.    No, he hired a team of lawyers to defend him, and then he formed a two pronged approach.    His first rebuttal – “Have you seen the film?”    I watched and listened at least a dozen times where this was Mr. Moore’s primary rebuttal.    And he would repeat it over and over again.    Not exactly a productive means to debate.    Of course, when someone had seen the movie, Mr. Moore fell back on his second rebuttal, also a question, “Well, why didn’t you ask the hard questions then?”    I’m sorry, but if you’re going to present an opening argument as inflammatory (pun intended) as his film, you have to be prepared to defend it in an educated manner.    Shouting the same thing over and over again is something that is best kept to recess, at elementary school.    This is, of course, my personal opinion.                    Back to the matter at hand, and that is, leaders often possess information, and often they do not.    But those leaders are making the best, most humane decisions that they can.    Criticism in hind-sight is a sucker-punch, unnecessary and unfriendly.    In fact, I heard a quote earlier today, from Ben Stein of all people, who was quoting another, “Critics point out all the problems and rule out all solutions.”    Unfortunately, this has become the mainstay of this years election.    When we are at a point when America as a county should be moving on, should be making leaps and bounds in the pace race, should be allowing America to become a connected and technological giant that the world has never seen before, when we should be legislating to solve the problems at home, we are focused on a pair of wars over seas that are under control.    Perhaps if the nation was where it should be, those 900+ Americans who have fallen as heroes overseas would be a much bigger deal.    50,000 men fell in   Vietnam  , and we’ve learned our lesson, do not disgrace those who have fallen in   Iraq   by labeling the war as one man’s revenge, one man’s greed.    Do not fall prey to another one man’s movie.    I’ll close my rant and step off my digital soap box with a quote from John Stewart of The Daily Show – “Now that Kerry’s given his speech, and Bush is set to give his, watch them both, and then…turn your television off.”    This is our nation, and it’s out social contract with our leaders, and we’re the ones to form our own decisions, not the pundits, not the film majors, not the celebrities who support and speak for this candidate or that candidate, but what the candidates tell us, and how they feel on the key issues.
