      Yes, things have come back around for us again!  I met with a mortgage broker this afternoon and managed to qualify us for an additional $15,000 more than our bank originally would and we can now get the new home we originally wanted.  We got the offer to purchase paperwork emailed from our Realtor tonight and just need to sign and deliver it to get going.  The house already has a lot and a basement dug, and once the purchase details are hammered out we'll be all set!  By the looks of it, we should have a brand new  urlLink Dundee  home by around October 1st.  You gotta love life's ups and downs!

      Ok, we declined the afore mentioned house we were keen on buying before the inspection.  Aluminum wiring is just too big of a pain.  Sure some say its fine, but when you ask an electrician whether he would buy an aluminum wired house, I guarantee they'll say no.    Ok, so we're on to plan B.  The market here is ridiculous, houses have offers the same day they're listed!  We're going back to the prospect of building brand new.  My realtor just managed to secure us with one hell of a deal with a new house.  I wasn't too excited about the floor plan as compared to the one we originally wanted (which went up $10,000!) but its definitely do-able.  The costs involved with a new house are pretty much on par with what it will cost to fix up an older home, so what the hell.  New home here we come!  Oh...Just that little financing problem...I won't even go into the scam my wife almost got caught up in...yet.  Sleazy, sleazy business there (thats from the help her parents offered us..thanks again).  Anyway, I'm going to try using a mortgage broker on Monday in the hopes of getting a better deal and higher approval.  Crossing my fingers.

      Today has been waaay too stressful! House inspection turned up problems, and to top it all off...My wife's parents are being complete assholes.  Where to begin!!  One of our conditions of purchasing our new home was to have a home inspection done first.  This was done earlier today, and it has turned up more problems than we hoped for.  Our biggest concern right now is the fact that the entire upstairs has  urlLink aluminum wiring .  I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this risk.  The inspector also found that all of the windows will need replacing, as they are all 30 yrs old.  The insulation in the attic needs an upgrade, and there is an issue with land sloping towards the house in the backyard. The toilet in the bathroom upstairs has been leaking into the surrounding area, and damage cannot be seen until the lino is removed. These are the major concerns.  I won't go into the other minor problems and cosmetic issues that need to be dealt with eventually.  I have until Friday to take it or walk away.    And finally the In-Laws...Dun dun dun.  My wife does not deal with stress well.  So of course her parents are completely opposed to us purchasing an older home.  They want us to buy brand new, which would be great.  However we're about $10,000 shy of ever affording that.  Think they would pony up that cash?  Not a chance in hell.  They're throwing bullshit at my wife about the cost of re-shingling ($5000..I don't think so) and that the street is too busy and the house is a dump (they haven't even seen it).  They don't seem to understand that we know how to look into the costs ourselves.  We've called for estimates on the repairs needed and we will decide if the house is worthwhile or not. It's why we forked out the money for an inspection in the first place!!  Now my wife and her Mom always fight, and I usually manage to stay out of it. But I'm starting to get more than slightly pissed with them about there negative stance.  Stay the hell out of it if you don't like it!  Ok. Stress rant over.  For now.  Feeling slightly better.

      So, after putting up with my  urlLink cable internet  service for the past 4-5 years, with its constant outage annoyances and Catholic School strictness on bandwidth, I decided it was time to check out the competition.  And what choices there were- we only have 2 ISPs up here.  The competition being  urlLink Telus , I gave them a call and asked about switching.  Everything sounded great, cheaper monthly bill, integrated phone service bundle, free modem rental, less strict on bandwidth usage and a bonus mp3 player.  Exactly what I wanted, sign me up!    So the modem arrived on Friday and after returning from my weekend camping trip, I unpacked it and set it up. One problem, no connection.  A quick call to Telus Tech Support informed me my phone line to the modem might be too long, so I traded off a long phone line for the recommended longer Ethernet cable.  Still no dice.  "Tech Support will come by on Tuesday between 8:30 am and 5:00pm."  They showed up at about 12:45pm which was handy as I was still home for lunch.  He informs me that my condo building has had problems connecting to there service and likely won't work.  He does some tests and tweaks what he can, but no dice.  Service unavailable.  Thank you Telus sales for telling me it was available and then wasting my time!  It's not this guys fault, so I thank him and let him on his way.  Luckily I haven't had a chance to cancel my cable internet yet, so at least I don't have to beg for it back.  Next up... a very annoyed call to my Telus salesperson.  Oh yes, you will be doing something to make me happy!

      Yes, we made an offer on Friday and they accepted! It's not the brand spanking new house we were originally hoping to build, but it is perfect.  A huge backyard leading directly to a school and park, a large deck with a heated workshop built underneath, a gorgeous basement with wet bar, fireplace and a sauna (do people actually use these?).  The upstairs looks like it needs a bit of a makeover, but overall it's in decent shape.  We do have to put new shingles on before the winter and the windows look a bit dated.  We're having a home inspection done this week so we'll know exactly what needs to be done.   We've managed to cancel our listing with our realtor so we can drop the price of our Condo much lower without the Realtor Fees now.  We do have to wait until September 1st for possession of our new home, but it gives us time to save our money and hopefully get rid of this condo.  Of course we only have until this Friday to finalize our pre-approved mortgage, and of course our mortgage agent took an extra day off today.  Ah! I don't know whether to talk to someone else today, or just wait until tomorrow and deal with the one I know.  The worst time to have a long weekend is when you need to finalize a house purchase!

      The first long weekend of the summer is here! Monday is Victoria Day here in Canada and that means practically everyone is going camping.  My wife, daughter and I are tagging along with my parents and there friends for a weekend camping trip.  Nothing spectacular, or too far away.  We're tenting it, but my parents do have nice big fifth wheel camper if it gets too crappy out.  It's always nice to take a break from the routine and get out of the city and relax.  No technology, no TV.  Just plenty of food, beer and campfires!

      Yes, the fam is going to upgrade!  We need a house, the condo is too damn small.  My office is in a closet, and it's hot as hell.  The condo fees have gotten to the point of insanity. Nobody wants to live here, it costs twice as much as the newer condos.  This forces us to lower our listing price to waaaay below what we bought the damn thing for.  At this point, I just want to be rid of it.  I know I'm going to lose money, and there is nothing that will change that.  Just need enough cash for a deposit on a new house.  The market just went up this week, putting our desired new house $10,000 above our pre-approved mortgage limit.  Depressing? Yes.  But we will find a way to get what we want...somehow! Good news though, my dad has offered to buy the condo so we don't get too screwed by the rising market.  If I help him rent it out, he will help us come up with a deposit for what we need.  Discussion about whether this will work happen this weekend!  Sounds better than sitting on this neverending wallet muncher.

      So, the quest of writing a personal blog has begun. Sure, I'll try to keep it interesting, but that is all dependant on my choice of subject and my personal writing skills of course. Anyway, thanks to those who do come and read and post comments.  Such freedom of expression is almost daunting, but it will be a great way for me to enhance my writing skills and have a free outlet for my roaming thoughts.  Let the ramblings begin...

      Finally after months of trying to sell with a realtor, we dropped the listings, wrote up a small Cash To Mortgage Ad, and sold our  urlLink Condo  in 3 days!  We're moving out as of August 1st to inhabit a room at my parents place until our new house is finished in November.  Sure it'll be weird living at home again, but we won't have any rent or utilities charges for the next 3 months!  We'll now be able to save a huge chunk of cash to help pay for our new house deposit and other necessities involved with buying a new home.

      Last night I got a call from my wife who works at our local sports bar.  "You'll never believe who I'm serving!" "Who?" "Wayne Gretzky's Dad!"  Yup, The Great One's Dad, Walter Gretzky was in our little city last night being served by my wife, and had a line-up of bar patrons waiting for an autograph.  My wife managed to get three personalized autographs (one for each of us and one for her Grandpa).  Pretty damn cool.  It turns out he's in town as a part of a charity event for Canada's Heart and Stroke Foundation.  I've never known much about Walter Gretzky, but it turns out he's been through quite alot:    About ten years ago, Walter made a miraculous recovery from a stroke that came close to killing him. Through his own grit and determination, and with the help of dedicated therapists, doctors, family and friends, he battled back from an aneurysm that left him with many cognitive difficulties and destroyed a decade of memories-including his recollection of the death of his mother and almost all of Wayne’s NHL triumphs of the eighties.   Today he dedicates himself to helping people understand what it is like to live in the aftermath of this catastrophic illness.  My wife said he was extremely friendly and came well prepared for signing autographs for all the patrons.  He chatted with many of them about his life and even wrote a message to one waitress' father who is in hospital battling from a sever heart attack.  Sitting underneath a statue of his son, it must have been quite a sight to see.  We don't get too many famous sightings here in Northern Alberta, and although this man may only be the father of one of the greatest hockey stars of our time.  He was definately looked upon as a hero by this group of bar patrons last night.  Walter Gretzky Info Sources:   urlLink Heart and Stroke Foundation   urlLink Prospeakers.com

      Hmmm how long until November now? 3 and a half months? Damn its going to be a long wait for that new house.  But its coming along, we drove by the lot yesterday and it looks like the foundation is all poured, so I imagine the next step is waiting for the framers to get going and our house should be done in no time.  Only a few more months to go... sigh.

      For my 25th Birthday (Monday, June 14), my wife planned out a great trip to Edmonton to go see  A Night of Improv  at the Winspear Centre.  This Sunday night show featured most of the stars of the TV show, 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', which included Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Brad Sherwood, Greg Proops, Chip Esten and Jeff Davis.  As Greg Proops so elegantly stated at the beginning, "We've got everyone but the rich guy and the black guy!".  It was basically the same format as 'Whose Line' with hilarious improvisations and bits fed from audience suggestions.  I've never laughed so much in my life, it was an amazing show.  On top of that, we also spent the afternoon at the  urlLink West Edmonton Mall  (World's Largest Mall). Here I took a ride on the worlds largest indoor triple-loop rollercoaster, the Mindbender, did a few rounds of "cosmic" 10-pin bowling at Reds, and went to the Casino where my wife won $250!  It was great!  Then on Monday (after sleeping off a slight hang-over), we headed back to WEM and spent the afternoon at the World Waterpark for some serious watersliding and wave-riding. I think we even managed to shop a bit too! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday excursion, it was one of our best trips and it was all packed into a day and a half.

      Ah... Life seems so tame after 2 weeks of house buying insanity!  Nothing much is happening in the aftermath, but apparently my wife has some sort of secret surprise planned for my B-day this weekend.  All that has been divulged is that it's in Edmonton and my buddy Andrew is going to be there.  My first assumption is that there's a band playing somewhere there, but I haven't come across any big shows for the weekend.  I don't want to ruin the surprise, so I've been decidedly not seeking out what it may be.  Should be a blast whatever it is.

      A sad day for us Albertans.  Calgary just lost the Stanley Cup.  It seemed pretty clear from the first two periods that Calgary was just outmatched in Game 7.  Tampa Bay was unrelenting and by the end of the 2nd period, it was 2-0 for the Lightning.  But Calgary came back in the third for a fierce battle that was missing from the first 2 periods.  Scoring during an undeserved power-play (Thanks Refs!) and laying it on shot after shot.  But TB proved unstoppable denying all but the one goal, winning the Cup with a final score of 2-1.  A well deserved win for Tampa, but it would have been amazing to have the Cup back in Canada with the Flames.  They did there best and proved there worth all the way to the end.  Good work Flames, maybe next year we'll see the cup a little closer to home.

      Today I got the call.  The financing is finalized and all conditions for purchasing have been fulfilled!  We got the blueprints for our house to be and we're stoked to see it built.  They already have the foundation dug and poured.  We are the proud owners of a hole!  The framing is going to be severely delayed due to the high demand and lack of labourers here, but by November 1st we will have a brand spanking new house!  Can't get much cooler than that.

      I know all you readers(yes, all 2 of you) are probably bored sick of hearing about the new house.  Well suck it up, cause thats what keeps me posting!   Picked out the colors for the outside of the house today and should have a rendering to approve by next week.  I'm also pleased to report that they've  finally  started framing!  And since we're out of the condo in 14 days, we've got our mailbox all set up.  The new areas of town have whats called a "Community Mail Box" which has a box and key assigned to you.  This allows us to start receiving our mail at our new address 3 months before we move in!  How convenient!
