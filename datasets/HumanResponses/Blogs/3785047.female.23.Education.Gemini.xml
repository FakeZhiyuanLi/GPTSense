       Another new semester...Another new Blogspot assignment...not that I'm complaining, but 15 entries are not that bad...We have already had two classes and as usual, we went through the normal introduction routine and getting to warm up for this course EDU 3234, Readings and Project Work....The best part of this course is when Dr Edwin announced that there won't be any exams but we definitely have to work with a lot of reading and writing tasks.  There will be position paper and research paper to look forward to...and our work is also going to be supervised by appointed supervisors. The truth is, I am looking forward to do this course, to read and start working on the papers because analysis and critical work are challenging and honestly, I do quite like to take up the challenge...One more semester to go, and I badly want to give it the best this semester.  Pn Juridah will be my supervisor, and I have met her once, to tell her that I am going to work with her...I have been taking many literature courses with her, so I do think I am quite lucky to have her as my supervisor as I am accustomed to the way she works.  Other than that, nothing much to say, except for another semester of tremendous hard work of reading and writing works of literature in English.

      Sounds fammiliar? Well, this is our first task for this course and we have to take a stand in our write-up and argue them out. It is not very easy to come up with a thesis statement, because it has to be precise and to the point that you are arguing. That's why we has the thesis statement bashing session in class just to get our statements right. Or should I say close to being correct. Next Monday, we have to present it in class and till now, I am still not very sure of how to tie the loose ends to my thesis statement. I want to work on the first narratorial voice in 'The Yellow Wallpaper' , and although I have the idea, but I find that I still lack the solid points. And the truth is, I don't want to be bashed out during presentation...as a wise man once said, "Say what you mean, and mean what you say"..i dont' even know what that means actually. Anyway, either I like it or not, I have to take position , a strong position in my paper of 'The yellow Wallpaper" and I will give my best shot at it.

      I needed help. I needed advice from others who are more experienced in this literature research thing. I was still without topics. So, I went to see  Miss Dzeelfa. She is a tutor in the faculty, pursuing Masters. And she's like God send, I discussed with her about what I thought of doing and she helped me in a few things and she even loaned me Karim Raslan's compilation of short stories. That's it!! His stories are interesting, and the best part is, he is contactable!! Therefore, after reading his stories , I decided to work on his stories. I like the way Raslan writes about the characters in the story. The characters are somehow in a conflict, somewhat lost and definitely not typical. Just like the author, I guess...  I am happy, that now I know what I want to work on, after cracking my head on this matter. I will go and see my supervisor and discuss my ideas with her. Anyway, I think it is interesting to work on Malaysian writers and see what I can discover from a Malaysian writer piece of literature.

      Allright, enough of position paper for a while. I would like to dwell on research paper now...ooouucchhh.. This is going to be a tough one. To start with, I went to the library to read up a few books that might help me with the topic of my research. Unfortunately, it didn't help me much. Frankly, I did not know exactly what I was looking for. Just browsed through and anything interesting that caught my eye, would be it. But , NONE! Anyway, I know that for this research paper, I must do a bit or a lot of extensive reading, because this is the purpose of this course. I need to connect any work of literature that I have read with the ones that I am going to read.. The voice inside me kept reminding me that I have not much of time, therefore novels are quite out of consideration. I know that there is no way, I can actually sit on a few novels to do my research. Therefore, I opted for short stories instead. I think this is much a better idea. Allright, choice of genre is taken care of. What stories? Who is the author? Ok, more questions to answer now, and I need to work on this fast because I need to present my topics to my supervisor. By the way, my friends and I, we've been on the hunt for Pn Juridah for  a week or so, and still no sight of her. It is really difficult to get hold of lecturers. When we bumped into her, we tried to arrange for an appointment, but she was quite buzy for a while and told us to get topics first. Allright, not that difficult but HORRIBLY TOUGH!!..Anyway, we are meeting her next week, and in the mean time I am looking for suitable stories to talk about....But what?????

      I like this story. It moves me somehow, and I know Gan especially likes this story. But I do not want to talk about the theme or how the story goes or how I believe in the protagonist and what not. I'm thinking of something else. How about the style? the way the story is convey..I think that it is just as important, rather than looking at the story alone. Well, I did some brainstorming and finally I'm thinking of writing about the point of view of that story. Maybe, by connecting the point of view and the plot , I may be able to take some kind of position there. After a lot of thinking, I came up with a theses statement that sounded like this; ' first person narratorial voice "The Yellow Wallpaper" evokes  a strong emotional attachment of the readers towards the protagonist's turmoil and conflicts'. How does that sound? Trust me, this statement is a revised statement after rejecting quite a number of theses statements that did not sound quite right. Anyway, I am glad I have something to write about and I am going to enjoy this piece if writing because I believe in it. As  a reader, I am deeply moved by the story because of its narration. I am drawn and I feel emotionally attached to the protagonist, so why not put my emotions on a position paper?....
