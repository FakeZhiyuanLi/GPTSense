       Let's Pretend!  Children have amazing and wild imaginations. The next time you hear "I'm bored" or "What can we do", give them a few household items, or let them make their own and watch them expand into endless hours of fun and entertainment. The following are just a few ideas to get the fun started and be sure to use your imagination too!  Make an Obstacle Course Obstacle courses can be a lot of fun, spark creativity and also be great exercise for the little ones. These can be set up in and out of doors. Pillows, chairs, tires and stools are just a couple of things that can be used to be climbed, jumped and skipped over, through, around and under. Time each child as they scramble their way through and have a race. Best thing about these is that once they've done everything they can think of with the first one, it can be torn down and set up again another way. Have each child take turns in choosing the way it's set back up.  Let's Play Dress Up Don't give away all those old shoes, shirts, pants, hats, gloves and costume jewelry! Set aside a special drawer or box for these item to play dress up. Have children act out their favorite play, television show or put on a fashion show. You'd be surprised exactly how cute she really looks in your old high school prom gown. Be sure to take snap shots or keep the video camera rolling!  Kid's Café Set up old card table and let the children play restaurant. Have children make up or use play money and menus. Children that can't write yet can draw the food items on the menus. Give them some paper plates, cups, plastic silverware, a little notebook and they're open for business. Take turns being waiter, customer and busboy (or girl ).  Go Camping This too can be played in or out of doors and the possibilities are endless. If you have a smaller pop-up tent, it can be set up in the living room. If you're taking this activity outdoors, you can hang an old sheet over a clothesline securing with rocks at the bottom. Have children draw or cut out windows if you're using an old sheet. (Remember to keep for the next camping trip.) Set up some lawn chairs around your faux fire and tell stories, sing songs, make smores in the microwave or any other favorite camping activity. Go all the way and sleep there tonight!  Movie Night Go to your favorite video rental store and have your child help pick out a movie for the whole family. Have children make tickets for the show, play money, popcorn, baggies of dried fruit, paper cups of juice or any other favorite snacks. Set these items up for "sale" and have each family member "purchase" their tickets and munchies. Then sit back and enjoy the show! ---------------------------  Anita DeFrank is a Work-At-Home mom, publisher and webmaster.

      Take an Education Vacation!  Choose one day out of each month and invite your entire family on an "Education Vacation". Invent games that can be not only fun but also educational at the same time. Your children will be having so much fun that they won't even realize that they're learning too! The following are a few exampls of activities that you can use or adapt to fit your family.  Theater Day Go to you local library and borrow several copies of a favorite or fun play. Assign each member a part and act it out in the living room! Younger children make an excellent audience. Alternate idea: Write your own play together.  Bring The Whole World Home Day Make a list of all the countries in the world (or just pick a few) and include a short description of each. Take turns reading each country and description out loud. Next take turns choosing a country from a map or globe. The rest of the family tries to guess which one by asking questions.  Time Table Day The night before have your family discuss everything that must be done the next day. Be sure to include some fun things to do also. Have the children design a time table to schedule the days activities. Make it a game to see how "close" you can stick to the schedule.  Make a Family Library DayHave each family member write and illustrate their own story. After each story is finnished copile them into a homemade book and design covers. Have older children help the younger ones write the text.  Question Game Day Each member of your family gets to ask a really hard question. Everyone else has to come up with ideas of how to find the answer till all questions are answered.  Goal of the Month Day Have each family member make a goal to improve one thing in their behavior, such as to exercise, read more or eat healthier. Track each members progress throughout the month on a chart. Don't forget to encourage each other during the month and celebrate victories too!  Art Detective Day Have each member of your family choose a piece of art that you have in your home (or is well-known by everyone)and describe it. Everyone else tries to guess which work of art it is.  ------------------------------------ Anita DeFrank is a Work-At-Home mom, publisher and webmaster.

      Creed fans have probably already heard the news that the band is no more. However, the band members minus lead singer Scott Stapp (Mark Tremonti, Brian Marshall, and Scott Phillips) have created a new band along with lead singer Myles Kennedy to create  urlLink Alter Bridge . I'll always love the first Creed CD (My Own Prison), but Human Clay and Weathered weren't nearly as good.   Of course we've only heard one song so far by Alter Bridge (Open Your Eyes, which can be heard at   urlLink VH1.com ), but I believe they have the makings of an even better band than Creed. In my opinion the band was always the greatest part of Creed, even though Scott Stapp's voice was alright. However I've immediately fallen in love with Myles Kennedy's voice - just what the Creed band members needed. The only thing I didn't like about this first song of theirs is the intro.  It's alright, but something a little "plain" or "ordinary"........something I can't quite put my finger on. The rest of the song the band rocks though.   Look for the new CD,  urlLink One Day Remains , to be in stores August 10th.  ~Kara

      Perhaps the need to create a more interesting life causes dreams and fantisy to seem so very real. So real that it feels like all sanity is about to be lost. Is it good to live in a dream or fantisy? Really isn't the goal in life to be happy? Maybe it's a different goal for everyone I don't know. I realise that most have the goal of making a lot of money, but for what? Does money really equal happiness? Maybe I suppose, it deffinately can. I know when I was so desparate for money it made every moment of my life hell ....not knowing when or how I was going to pay my bills. Now that I'm fine, I'm still not completely happy though. Something is missing, and that something is love. So maybe the goal in life is to have a complete life - money, love, and health. Well and of course I suppose some other things but they seem to fall in the money catagory.   To fill the void of love, I wonder if it's ok to live in a fantisy world. One of hope, pretending. Do we set ourselves up to fall when we do that? Or is it a way to cope?   My head is starting to hurt, way too much thinking.

      Well this had me dancing around all day yesterday - I got my tickets for the Nickelback/Puddle of Mudd concert in August. 5th row no less! How cool! Forgive me if I'm a bit over excited and shouting out my rather uninteresting news, but I'm almost 23 yrs old and have never been to a real concert, aside from the local blue's festival every year. So yeah, this is a HUGE deal for me. Now it's just a matter of finding someone to go with me, although I doubt that will be a problem. My ex I'm sure will be jumping at the chance to leech off of me, but I'm crossing my fingers I can find someone a little more worthy and desirable to go with. And hey if they pay me for the ticket even better, but I'm more interested in a designated driver. ;)  Kind of weird to be thinking about that concert right now while listening to Lisa Lobe. Hadn't heard this CD in quite some time, and always liked it for the poetic value. Tune isn't bad either, but the words I've always admired most. I've heard what I wanted to hear, time to listen to something else.   The thought crossed my mind today that I feel a little silly writting my thoughts down for the world to see like this. I have a tendency of going back months or years later and reading things I've wrote, then saying "YUCK! Was that stupid or what?". So this blog is really a odd thing for me, and I must say I do feel a little weird.   Enough rambling for now, I'm off to cook supper and play DA for awhile.   ~Kara

      My ex made a suprise appearance the other night, claiming he was there to see his daughter but obviously had other intentions. There was obviously a reason he was telling me his girlfriend and him had broke up, and that he had moved out of her house. I've always felt sorry for him for some reason, even though I know he could care less about my feelings or situation. This is his world, and we should pitty him only - or so he thinks. I can't allow myself to worm his way in here, even though the loneliness is eating away at me. Hopefully having my sights on someone else will fight the urge to let him back in here, because I know that letting him back into my life would only cause me more pain and suffering. I'm just so torn. I know he's no good for me, and really has no good qualities either, it's just a fear of being alone that's got me even concidering him. I can't allow myself to let him take over me again, I just can't. There ARE good people out there, I got a taste of what was out there and can't let go of it.   Enough rambling and thinking.....back to business to get my mind off of all of this.

      It seems that everytime I find something perfect, it either turn sour or so many obsticles get in the way that it becomes impossible to share a life. A very special person has entered my life (actually 2), but I fear that both are about to completely dissapear. Its apparent that a romantic relationship is not possible with either right now, and may never be possible, despite my longing for something real to hold on to. What is true love anyway?

      The website bug is started to taunt me again, and I'm feeling the urge to build something music related. Nothing small, no no, that's not me. Of course I would like to focus on the hard rock bands of today such as Stained, Trapt, Nickelback, Evenescence, etc. Now wouldn't that be interesting? What I would really love to do is find some way to offer a legal downloading site that you would only have to pay a monthly fee for unlimited downloads. I know I'm begging for something like that. Oh the possiblities, with such little time to work on them. If only I could snap my fingers and everything would be done. What a perfect world that would be.   Music music music.....that's all I've had on my mind today it seems. That and business. I like having my motivation to work back, but at the same time it seems like a huge burden because there's just too many ideas flying at me and my stress level is beginning to rise yet again. *sigh* To have the best of both worlds would be perfect.

      What to do, what to do......my poetry website has been sitting on a back burner for far too long. I had an idea for it way back last fall, and actually created two websites for it (one was to be mainly just a community, and the other site filled with other interests of mine that I felt somewhat related to poetry yet different enough that it deserved it's own site). I had it mostly completed when Christmas was nearing and another website of mine needed attention. After a successful Christmas season I realised how far I could take the other website and ran with it. When things finally died down and I couldn't build another page, I took a look at my poor poetry website and sighed. No motiviation, no energy, no ideas. It was like all the creativity had been sucked from my brain. All I could do was sit and play  urlLink Dark Ages  (an online game).   Well FINALLY I've been hit with the idea bug, and started on another business project. Of course, NOW I'm being hit by one idea after another and want so desparately to get started on changes to that little poetry site. I pop in every once in awhile to see what's going on, and watch the member count grow (thank you Google for the good search engine rankings!). Now it's just a matter of WHAT and WHEN to work on.....(please allow me to begin thinking out loud here). I believe the first thing I'm going to add is a poetry contest section, devoted to listing legitimate poetry contests with decent prizes. (Not the general "Congratulations! Your poem has been selected to be in our book - here buy it")   What to do after the contest section? Well, I was thinking of having a publishing section too that has information on how to get published or even go so far as to publish a full book. I know that is one of my personal dreams to have at least one book published on something I hold dear to my heart (the business crap is really starting to get to me).   That's my ramblings for the day. I hope to find time to actually get to work on those sections. I just hate to see that site just sitting there when it could be so much more.....  ~Kara

      Well this is the start of my personal blog, nothing special really, just my own personal ramblings and thoughts on personal issues. I'll share some thoughts on my favorite rock groups and hey maybe even pull out some good poems from my poetry community (  urlLink Spiritual Expression  ).   Music is my life and sums up my interests though. I like to write and read poetry, but only in the right mood. Music I can't go a single day - hell sometimes HOUR - without. Speaking of which, I'm off to find some new CDs to add to my growing collection.

      Someone should really take away half my music collection. Every time I sit down and listen to songs I haven't heard in a long time I start digging up memories that really should stay burried. Never fails, with the memories comes the questions.......  Tonight an 80s song, one of my favorites actually, sent me off in a serious of questions and pondering some issues. "Every Rose Has It's Thorn" came out years before I was even old enough to date, but even so it was a song that held a lot of meaning to me because it reminded me of my first true love. The one in high school I fell very hard for, and thought about him every day even years after we had "split up for good". I moved on with someone else and had a son, he moved on with someone else and had a son, but every time I heard that song I thought of him.&nbsp; By some stroke of luck when things between my son's father and I had gotten very very bad,&nbsp;we ran into eachother.&nbsp;Both of us thought we would never see eachother again, but fate had a different&nbsp;plan.   It didn't take us long to fall back into old times, and there we were just like we were in high school. Two people that had previously swore off marrage and real romance getting married just 2 months after "getting&nbsp;back together", then having a daughter 8 months later.  But times changed.&nbsp;Divorce came just&nbsp;after my daughter turned a year old.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to wonder if we got married because we had sworn 6 years before when we were just kids that we would. Or was it an attempt to have that fairy tale ending? Did we push fate just a bit? He seems like a completely different person now, nothing like what I knew. Maybe I just saw him for what he really was........something I just ignored or didn't want to see before. Even still it seems he acts differently towards me now. Why I can't say.   I can at least&nbsp;say I don't wonder "what might have been" -&nbsp;already found that out the second time around.

      I love my local radio station. Little information released that is NOT on their website, but  I  actually have - the debute CD of Future Leaders of the World ("Lvl 4" is the name of the CD) is set to release August 17th. They sure are cutting their promotion short - we've known about the upcomming debute CD of Alter Bridge (One Day Remains) for several weeks now and that CD releases just a week before on August 10th. Ah well, important thing is we now know the date! YES! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Sitting here fixing a few typos I caught from last night's entry, and sure enough that song comes on the radio - "Here Without You" . Which the typo I noticed were in the lyrics of that song (that will teach me to take a short cut and copy the lyrics from somewhere else - I always wonder how the heck these people get the words WRONG more often than right).  &nbsp; Still waiting anxiously to see what&nbsp;happens tomorrow, and if my special someone happens to drop by. Time will tell, but I'm really hoping he does.&nbsp;Even if he doesn't well that's ok I'll understand.&nbsp;Physical separation right now might be a good thing.  &nbsp; ~Kara&nbsp;

      It's been quite awhile since&nbsp; I could say that. So much has happend in the past year, shaking my believes to the very core. Tearing apart everything that held me together. But now......oh now.....  &nbsp;  Earlier this month I had a dream. It was about the certain someone I had been somewhat envolved with for a very short time, but known for years. What we had I felt was cut short, and why I write about him often here because he is still very much on my mind. So about this dream....it was set in high school and my mom's old house where I grew up (comfort zones). My special someone is making sly passes at me every time he walks by. Like grabing my hand briefly&nbsp;and running his hand across my sholders as if to take me in his arms but not stopping to do so.  &nbsp;  I believe the main point of this dream was to confirm my doubts of if he still cares for me or not. The sly passes told me he does. So what does this have to do with fate? Well while talking about this dream with my mom in the car earlier this week (or was it last week? Not important.....), a song comes on the radio. The name of the song is "Here Without You" by 3 Doors Down.&nbsp; I've listened to this song quite a bit lately, because the words hold a lot of meaning to me right now and just fit the situation. The words are as follows:  &nbsp;   A hundred days have made me older    Since the last time that I saw your pretty face    A thousand lights had made me colder    And I don’t think I can look at this the same    But all the miles&nbsp;that separate    They disappear now when I’m dreaming of your face     I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind    I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time    I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams    And tonight it’s only you and me     The miles just keep rolling as the people&nbsp;don't even waite&nbsp;to say hello    I hear this life is overrated but I hope it gets better as we go     I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind    I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time    I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams    And tonight girl it’s only you and me     Everything I know, and anywhere I go    It gets hard but it won’t take away my love    And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done    It get hard but it won’t take away my love     I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl it’s only you and me   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So yes I found it odd that this particular song, one I've been listening to for weeks while I've been thinking about him just "happend" to come on while talking about a DREAM no less I had about him. Coincedence maybe, I wasn't completely convinced and didn't fully believe in Fate just yet.  &nbsp;  Then there was yesterday. I got an email from him in the morning just before I headed to Walmart. Nothing unusual, he emails me often. I emailed him back and ran off to lunch then to Walmart. Being one that is not fond of cell phones in public places, I left my phone in the car like I always do. After lunch I look and there's 2 missed calls with no number on the caller ID. Could it have been him? I'm thinking it was, but wasn't sure. I don't bother to find out because if it was I know he'll call back later. We get to Walmart and after a little while who should I see? Yup - it's him. I can't believe I've ran into him like this. He states he just tried to call me (and when I left I realise he tried to call a 3rd time just minutes after I had gotten out of the call and went into Walmart).&nbsp; Now WHAT are the chances of THAT? Him trying to call 3 times missing me every time, then running into him in person. FATE.  &nbsp;  Even still for the last few weeks I've been out of my mind trying to figure out WHAT is going through his mind, WHY he is still talking to me even though it was his decision for us not to be together right now (for reasons I understand). I over analysed it, because tonight I flat out asked what was going on. His response - he wants to be with me and has feelings, but doesn't know what to do with the situation he's in. He still wants to talk to me I think for that reason. Maybe for a "back up" or so that we don't get lost again - ok no problem I understand that. I may not waite, or I might decide to. Only time will tell. All I know for now I'm happy. Oh, and another twist of fate tonight right after I hung up the phone after talking to him, I turn on the radio and playing is song that we had been talking about. I had told him earlier this week it was a good song he needed to hear, and he mentioned to me yesterday he still hadn't heard it. Funny there it was on tonight right after I was done talking to him. FATE.  &nbsp;  So there it is. I believe again. Now soul mates and true love, well that's going to take a bit of time still....  &nbsp;  ~Kara

      Another day, much like the rest. Thoughts of CDs that I *must* get soon, memories from the past (yikes I knew better than to listen to music from high school - good new CD Stone Temple Piolets put out though with their greatest hits), and that certain someone still on my mind. Didn't help matters that I just "happend" to run into him today at the store. Thankfully this time he was alone, so we chatted for awhile. Oddly enough he'd just tried to call me (so that's who those 3 missed calls where on my phone) when we saw eachother. Of all the people to see - there he was. I had just been talking about him too. Funny how things work out like that. Kinda like the other day when I had been talking about a dream I had of him, then by some chance "Here Without You" came on the radio (there is a line in the chorus that says "Your still with me in my dreams, and tonight it's only you and me").&nbsp; I wonder if all these little signs are suppose to make me believe in fate again. I use to, but wow after all the crap that happend with my ex honestly I really don't know. I thought we were fate, but obviously that wasn't true. Maybe it was, but just in a learning sort of way - to learn from my mistakes and whatnot. My head is starting to hurt again.  &nbsp; Either way this must be love because I feel like&nbsp;hell right now without him. Now if I only knew how to get him back......... &nbsp; ~Kara&nbsp;

      I've played over the events with a special someone over and over in my head trying to make sense of it all. The only thing I succeed in doing is giving myself a headache and making it even more confusing. Once in awhile I stop to ponder what happend to the girl years ago that would change men more often then filling up my gas tank in high school. Perhaps significant others where more plentiful back then, or maybe things were just a lot less serious in general. I don't think I really thought about the future too often, knowing I had years to choose my path and run with it. It's possible if I had the resources I did back then I would be the same as I once was, but who really knows.   The only thing that circles my mind now is finding that great love of a lifetime (Isn't that a song? Yeah......I like that song), and loosing myself completely in the magic. Then the familiar phrase "all good thing must come to an end" pops in my mind, and I wonder if I've already had my share of "magic" for this lifetime. How many times do we get to feel like that anyway? That we are safe, and we know in our heart this is the person we never want to spend a second away from.   Why is it our hearts and minds can change so quickly, and we get stuck in a rut? Does the magic always fade and leave us with a jaded outlook on love?   Eh, maybe it's just me and my "do or die" "run with it" personality. I suppose it's possible if I didn't think like that, I would have never felt so high as I did with those I've loved and still be sitting here wondering if true love will ever find me.   *sigh*  ~Kara

      I can't get this band out of my head or their debut song, "Let Me Out". So much passion behind it, and so well written. I am very anxiously awaiting the release (or a release DATE for that matter!!) of their debut CD. I'm very positive it will be just as powerful as the first song, if not MORE. The only information I see on the official website is that it will be released "Fall 2004". UGGGGGHHHHHH! I just hope they give us another song or two to hear on the radio before then, so the radio stations don't over play the song due to all the requests and burn us out on it before the record even hits the stores. Seems like that came VERY close to happening with Seether's re-release of Disclaimer when the radio station started playing "Broken" featuring Amy Lee every other hour. Luckily they backed off at the last minute so that CD is still at the top of my wish list.    ~Kara

      I couldn't hold back anymore. I had to jump into the music world and build a website I was truely passionate about. Well  hopefully this one page will hold off the cravings for a full site just until I have a little more time to devote to one. The list is of course no where near complete, and I'm waiting on Amazon to start selling the new Saliva CD and the debut CD of Future Leaders of the World (If you haven't heard their debut song, "Let me Out", I suggest you immediately drop what you are doing and demand your local rock radio station play it - it's just creepy how much the lead singer sounds like Kurt Cobaine).   Anyway, here's the site, enjoy:  urlLink http://www.spiritualexpression.com/new-rock.html   ~Kara

      I just got word the date I posted a few weeks ago was wrong. Their CD actually doesn't come out until August 24th. I think. Pretty sure that's what I heard today, but again I could be wrong. Still watching for it on Amazon so I can preorder a copy of it. Still excited to hear some new singles too, which I imagin we will be hearing on the radio soon.   Found two more VERY intresting resources on this band - their  urlLink message boards  and (hardly containing excitement) their  urlLink BLOG ! Yes THE Phil Taylor (lead singer) is posting on this one. Well actually it looks like most of the band is posting on the boards too (still reading posts - it's not that old, so there aren't all that many).   Very exciting updates!

      We can check another item off our list of things to do, since Home Business Specialists is now finished and open. Next comes the huge job of promotion. With a good plan it shouldn't be too big of an issue. Basically we want to start with networking, since that's the best free source of traffic. We'll move on to some other sources very shortly. There really shouldn't be much we will have to do for promotion since all pages are optimized for the search engines, and most traffic is going to come from that.  I do need to work on getting the website listed in some directories, which I'll be working on for the rest of the week.   It's always very exciting to get a new website started, but also a LOT of hard work. It's good to know that my other websites are on "autopiolet" so to speak, and don't need my attention as much. :)   By mid July I hope to have enough time to work on another site of mine that I never really did finish, and I'm just dying to. I suppose if I really wanted to I could get a lot more done online and off, but lack of motivation and energy kicks in and I can't do a thing. Ah well, as long as I get a few things done a day I feel like I've accomplished something and the day hasn't been waisted. :)  ~Kara

      Thats the way my ended yesterday and started today.  Yesterday afternoon it was so bad and I felt as though nothing had gotten accomplished that I gave up and decided to do some yard work.  I needed to feel some sort of accomplishment!  This morning I tried to jump right back in hoping the motivation had come back...nope, still wasn't there.  I drug on through the biggest part of the morning just about to give up when bam! everything hit me at once.  I now had work to do to help Kara with the business site, a friend thats just starting out online to help and the ezine to get ready for tomorrow (we've decided that as long as the kiddos are home from school..mornings are no longer my "time").  Yay!  And the motivation is back!  Ezine is all ready to go and I managed to help Kara with a handful of the pages for the business site (with a couple of extra new ideas for it even!).  Not to mention my offline friend is about 2 steps away from having her very own website!  Not too bad for a day that started out so slow.  Always remember...no matter what...Keep On Pluggin!  Anita :)

      Today was a rather rocky day to say the least in my household, what with problems hitting me from every direction (an extra fussy baby due to a missing pacifier, a computer that wouldn't stop acting up, and then to top it off slicing my finger on a can then finding my son had taken off with all the band aids). After taking a deep breath and finally getting that fussy baby to sleep, I found the pacifier, the computer started working again, and my finger stopped bleeding. By then it was of course time to go to the store.   Aside from all that, I manage to at least start on 2 pages from the business side of "the big project". So really I'm actually pleased I managed to salvage something from the day. :)  ~Kara

      I don't have to hold back any longer, Home Freelance Jobs is now live! I'm so excited, even though this is just one of the two parts to the big project. Won't be much longer before the other site is finished. Even still, we are now excepting applications for independent contractors so that when the other website is finished we will have all our "ducks in a row" so to speak. It feels good to be offering home jobs for those looking, and we realised there were a LOT out there.   So here we go.......the adventure is just starting!  ~Kara

      Ooooo I'm so excited that we are FINISHED with one of the two sites for our "big project". I've never been good at keeping secretes, and when I'm excited the whole world knows about it. I want to scream out the URL to our new site, but actually the files havent' been uploaded to the host yet, so I know I had better just keep quiet for another day or two.  Really it's amazing how much you can accomplish with another person. There's no way I could have gotten that site finished quickly if it hadn't been for Anita doing the research on a few things and making sure the content was "just right". Here we were estimating that we would get this first site done by Friday, and it's only Tuesday! Amazing! I don't feel like I've overworked myself the last few days either, so that is a major plus. :)   Seems like this project started going faster once we got some of the first steps done (market research and main idea for the website). I think it was only last week we finally started working on content. Now look at us go!   If you couldn't tell, I've been having fun with this project. Just thinking of the possibilities with a new website keeps me going and never gets me bored. Just taking the first step and getting over the first hill is the key. ;)   ~Kara

      Wow!  Today was a very successful day when you look at accomplishments but, my oh my!  Have you ever searched for affiliate products on a very wide range scale?  I mean, I have alot of area I can cover with affiliate programs with the new project...and finding the right ones that you want to promote can be a very daunting process.  Try going to Amazon sometime with one subject in mind and do a search for books related to that topic....Not back yet?  Now try that with a whole bunch of topics!  Yeah, ha, I'll see you next week.  And thats just Amazon!  Now try Clickbank, CJ, Commission Junction...yeah, let's say I'm not done with my part of the job yet!  Time for a break...till tommorrow!  Anita

      I swore I was not going to do any more challenges because they end up killing me, but I can never resist. Jumping in a bit late for the June challenge at WAHM.com, but we can still pull it off I'm sure. Actually it might be a good thing we came in late, so that we need to push that much harder. The plan is to finish up the "big project" by the end of the month and officially launch.   Today was a good day for the most part, since we managed to get the content done for yet another page. Still quite a few to go though. Some pages we should be able to fly right through like the "about us" and "contact" no doubt. Others might take a little more time due to forms.   Tomorrow I would at least like to get the main page done for the site that needs to be completed by next week. I don't think there is much more than needs to be done with it after that, so finishing it by the end of next week should be no problem. :)  ~Kara

      Despite the fact that I'm just a tad burned out on affiliate marketing (I don't look forward to look at much of anything except my checks lately) due to the fact I went so many month building as many pages as possible, but today's chat was really fun. I've noticed Rosalind Gardner's book,  urlLink Super Affiliate Handbook  has hit the WAHM world in a big way and quite a few are either currently reading it or planning to buy it soon. I do in fact own the book and think it's an EXCELLENT resource. I tend to do things a little different, so may not be using everything from the book. BUT I found it to be a wonderful step by step book for beginners, and picked up some little ideas (and merchants) that I missed before. Well worth it!   Anyway, the chat was a good one today, and I did enjoy chit chatting with everyone that was there. At one point the chat did turn to SEO as an affiliate marketing chat normally does, so we've decided to have an open discussion on SEO next week. Same day, same time, same place (Wednesday, 2pm EST, at the  urlLink Online Party Room  ). Hope to see an even larger turn out next week. :)  Haven't really given much thought as to what other topics we will have, although I imagin some chats on offline marketing would be great since summer officially begins in a week and a half. The offline world will most deffinately be hoping, so I belive it would be a good idea to have an open chat on some ideas.   I do hope tomorrow we will be able to work on our large business project as I'm anxious to get it done. :)  ~Kara

      Yup, today was definately better!  Wednesday's are ezine days.  Today's ezine took just a bit longer to get out than it had been. Even though we gather all the information the day before?!?  Ah, but you'll have these days!    Once the ezine was out and I got a chance to browse through my email a bit from the night before it was lunch time.  Oh, lunch time!  One of my most favorite times of the day.  Because I get to eat?  Nope, because I know its nap time after that!  I really do love my kids I swear!  LOL!  Ah, but seriously, the reason I was so waiting for nap time today was because today we were holding our first weekly chat.  Today's topic was affiliate marketing and this seems to be one of my favorite topics lately.  I'm still in the learning process by all means but...I'm getting there.  I think we had a really successful chat this afternoon.  We had a variety of people in there.  People who knew what they're doing (such as Kara, LOL), people who have just dabbled a bit, and then the complete newbies.  I think some of us learned alot of new things today.  Till next week...SEO!  All and all I think we managed to get a decent amount of work done today but I'm looking forward to tomorrow and diving back into the new project again!    Oh, and how could I almost forget!  My message boards are back up!  Anita :)

      As Anita mentioned, we did indeed get quite a bit done today. I felt good about getting the content on a page done, and many of the images for half of a new site. Not to mention working together with Anita to get a set up for articles working the way we wanted to, so that she could work on getting article pages done.   As always it was a challenge with the kids, as they were either getting in trouble or asking me for something the entire day. Normal, but stressful none the less. I've been strongly concidering taking them to a sitter once a week, just so I get a little peace and quiet. Only problem is it would require me to drive 10 minutes to the next town, 10 minutes getting them in and settled down (plus idle chit chat with my aunt), and another 10 minutes home. That's a half hour gone already, then another half hour going back over to get them. 1 hour total. Well, not really worth it I don't think, unless I can talk my mom into at least taking them over there when she's done at the store. THAT might be worth it, but still something I need to think about (and talk my mom into).   Aside from the stress of the children, I've felt I've had a really great day. I've struggled with motivation issues for nearly 2 months now, and today was the first day I really felt I've gotten over that. Well, proof positive - it's now 8pm and I'm STILL HERE at the computer brainstorming and doing things I know need to get done instead of saying "eh, tomorrow....". I can barely keep all the ideas in my head I'm so excited. Although my online game is calling me, and I feel the need to relax a little bit after this busy day. I think I've deserved it :)   ~Kara

      First of all I'll start this post off with a promise NOT to turn this into my own personal venting board!    Today started off a real doosey!  Mommy's Helper's message boards were down, I couldn't add any more tracking codes to my web pages, my priviledges at Ryze had been taken away because they Ryze administrator's accused me of spam at the end of May (when actually all I was doing was replying via private messenger to say thanks to all the birthday wishes I had receieved!), my 3 year old (his name is Cole, I'm sure he'll be mentioned alot in any of my venting posts, LOL!) was getting into everything and anything that he wasn't allowed to AND to top it all off I had to call my 7 year old's (her name is Melanie) school to request that she be held back in the 2nd grade for when school started again this fall!  Needless to say, I'd rather crawled right back into bed.  Nah, not start the day over...just sleep right through it.  So, in efforts to try to turn this into a better day I kept working.  I did alittle surfing of things that I always meant to take a look at but, just didn't take the time.  Good news!  In my surfing I managed to find a very resourceful site for me to keep an eye on to help me with my new adverture into affiliate marketing.  A little later Kara comes online and is ready to work.  Great!  So, we work on our new project for most of the day.  And let me say...we kicked some major butt and got A LOT accomplished.  Kara worked on scripts and links of the sites and I busily worked on getting the articles ready to be put online.  Together we worked on more of the content and managed to get quite a few pages ready to go :)  Started this blog and set up a new chat room for tommorrow's first chat on Affiliate Marketing.  Wow!  I really felt as though we had gotten so much accomplished!  That made me feel so much better.  Heck, I even forgot my message boards were still down.  As we plugged away I received a phone call from my daughter's school.  I went over with her about how I'm so torn between holding Melanie back or not.  She reassured me by the end of summer between the 3 of us we'd find the best solution for her.  I'm still not sure where I stand because she'll be doing some testing on her to find out whether or not she has a learning disability.  She's so very slow at reading and it's holding her back in all her other subjects.  So, if the answer is not to hold her back, that means she does have a learning disability and if the answer is to hold her back...well, think about it.  How would you feel if you were 7 years old again and needed to repeat the grade over again?  Poor thing!  I just feel so horrible for her!  But, I do feel so much better that I'll have some real reasoning behind the decision in the long run.  Then I won't feel quite so badly about the ultimate answer.  As I was working on getting the articles ready for tommorrow's ezine, I happened to mention to Kara the problems I was having with the stats codes.  She graciously taught me a little trick thats actually going to save me a lot more time each week and be able to add additional codes!  So...I guess my little lesson behind all my ramblings would be that no matter how bad things look.  Keep pluggin!  Keep working.  You'd be surprised what actually might come out of it!  I know I was :) (Even though my message boards are still down!!)  Toodles! Anita :)

      Still working on  urlLink RecipesForMom.com  and adding new ebooks (just added  urlLink Coffee Lovers Recipes  and currently working on one for Chocolate Lovers). More importantly I'm needing to do quite a bit of link exchanges and submit to a few directories. After thinking about it last night I'm going to have to spend a week on promotions. That will include seeking out link exchanges, submitting some recipes to newsletters that are requesting them, submitting to directories, and writing another article. I figure if I start out actively seeking link exchanges (not just posting that I'm looking to exchange links - I did that already and well, the resonse was very minimal), I'm going to stumble on directories, places to submit recipes, and other ways to advertise.   Although my first choice for links and advertising is going to be text links, I realise I'm going to have to have some buttons and banners on hand just in case. So that should probably be the first thing I do before I start seeking link exchanges.   I've wondered if I should have done these link exchanges as I finished up each site. But then I think, no I think waiting until I was finished with all the sites was a good idea since all my sites are so different. This way when I seek out link exchanges the chances of one of my sites matching one I want to exchange links with are greater since my websites are all different.  It's deffinately true what they say - you are never done with a website!

      Well now, here I sit with TWO websites finished and THREE ebooks so far to go with them. Not bad concidering it was just Friday when the ideas started hitting me. This is what I was talking about when I said I get an idea an run with it.   Really I'm not finished yet. I have many many more ebooks to format, packages to put them in, and several more websites to finished. Either way I'm quite excited that I've accomplished so much already!   So here's a run down of what I've finished so far:    urlLink RecipesForMom.com  - Includes links to recipes, listing of cookbooks and ebooks, and resources.    urlLink Free Bread Machine Recipes  - The name says it all! Lists several bread machine recipes plus non-machine recipes.    urlLink Bread Machine Recipes Ebook  - includes over 70 recipes specifically for bread machines.   urlLink Low Carb Bread & Pastry Recipes  - Lists over 20 low carb recipes. Yes those on low carb diets CAN eat bread!   urlLink Jam Recipes  - Over 100 different jam recipes. Very large collection!   So that's about it *for now*. I'm just about ready to work on getting a few more ebooks ready, then will look to build more websites. LOVE IT!

      Ugh!&nbsp; My first real "debut" and I can't even hear it :(&nbsp; I've tried many, many times to listen to  urlLink Wahm Talk Radio  shows, but to no avail.&nbsp; And of course this show I'd REALLY like to hear I still can't.&nbsp; Yeah, even though I knew I couldn't, I sure tried like heck!&nbsp; Kelly had promised to send me a CD copy of it so, I'll still get to hear it but the wait!!&nbsp; I get to read what everyone else has to say about the show and can't even really reply.&nbsp; I was a bit to nervous to remember the whole thing anyway! LOL!  So, this shall be on my goals list.&nbsp; I have most of the other equipment and supplies I need for my business.&nbsp; Next goal is to find some alternative to dial-up.&nbsp; DSL isn't available in my area.&nbsp; I don't believe cable is available here either.&nbsp; Yeah, I'm in the middle of no-where!&nbsp; Time to do some real searching!

      I love to keep busy, and I love to juggle things in my life. Doesn't mean it's GOOD for me, but that's a different story.......  I've decided to start a new project, one that Anita is still very much a part of but really is "my" project. I went head first into it, snooping around last week for recipes and doing the SEO research on it, then buying the domain names Friday night. I was still working over the weekend against my own rules, but I didn't care. I had an idea, and I was running with it! Plus I kept telling myself that since I'm now helping my mom at the restaurant 2 days a week until school starts I won't have as much time online. Ummmm, really it's not much different than the days I was going to Walmart (which has now been moved to Saturday), but heh, it was an excuse to work!  So anyway, this weekend I got one full ebook finished (really it was just formatting, so it didn't take THAT long - I was just "half way" working over the weekend anyway), and started in on two of the websites that are going to be attached to this project. The big one and a side one. They really will be working together, actually. The way I have it planned out in my head is like this:   1. Visitors will be brought in from the small site, which will have *a few* free recipes. On the website will be an option to buy an ebook with a TON of recipes. This is of course a niche market, not just recipes in general. The niche is "To Be Announced" here. Don't want to give any secretes yet!  2. When the visitor does buy the ebook they are taken to the big site, which has the niche ebook related to the first website, plus will have other recipe ebooks and other recipe/cooking related items.   3.&nbsp; When the recipes are printed from the ebooks, the logo for the big site will be on every page, thus driving more visitors to that big site to buy more ebooks.  &nbsp; I've already got all the recipes I need to make quite a few niche ebooks, and most likely more mini sites to pull in visitors. (I haven't done ALL the research on the other markets, just the first mini site). I figure I will only need a few mini sites to generate a desirable amount of visitors to the major site and sell a good amount of ebooks, along with other items. ;)   Well now, I've shared quite a bit of information here. Hopefully not too much - wouldn't want someone running off with my idea!   ~Kara

      Yes! FINALLY DONE! Well, for now anyway. I'm in serious need of some link exchanges for all my websites, so just as soon as I'm done with the next one I'm off to make some exchange requests on a few groups that have a high response rate. I'm just so excited (and exhausted) now that I've finally got the revamp of that website finished. I also had that site accepted to Froogle (Google's shopping directory project), and got my files uploaded so hopefully that makes a huge difference in my search engine rankings. I don't know much about Froogle since I've always delt with affiliate programs, so we will see. (The candles are not via affiliate programs, I'm a wholeseller for Kovacs Creation and she does dropshipping - I've sold those candles mostly locally for well over a year now so about time I paid a little more attention to that website).   While it's after 8pm and I really should get off the computer, I'm just too antsy to work on the new recipe project. I purchased some recipes with resale rights on eBay, and plan on using them in various ways (exact details will be announced when I get closer to having the website and future websites finished).  I still have work to do with Mom's Market, but oh I'm getting SO sick of changing those pages it's not even funny anymore. Even still I know it has to be done and it's going to be worth it in the long run.   Looks like work on the hobby site has been postponed most definately. *sigh* Oh well.  Well I still want to get some more work done, but right now I need to spend a little time with my daughter before she goes to bed. ;)  ~Kara

      My what a day it's been - a very very long day. I'm working just a bit of over time today now that the kids are in bed, because tomorrow I'll get in an hour if I'm lucky before I have to take off - I've somehow gotten suckered into helping my mom at her restaurant. She's only open 2 days a week, and now that her husband has gotten a new job it's just her running the show. Obviously she needs some help. Thank goodness it's only 2 days a week and for a month or so. Interfears with my schedual just a bit, but maybe I can sucker her in to free babysitting and house cleaning instead of money for working. That would deffinately be worth a lot more than she could pay.   Well let's see, I've accomplished quite a bit today. Not everything is crossed off my list, but a few things took a little more time than expected. I had hoped to get Soy Wax Candles done today, but didn't. I did end up buying a&nbsp;$5 template, which I did manage to customize today. That was a biggie and more than half the work. Editing all those buttons isn't exactly quick and easy. So the good news is I got the main template done and an additional 12 pages + home page finished. The bad news is I've got another 25 pages to do. UGGGGHHHHH. *Crossing fingers* I can sneak in some time tomorrow to get it done.   I did also manage to update another section on Mom's Market. So I'm now sick to death of codes and I swear I can't stand to look at any more today. I've got to try to get some sleep and hopefully get up early tomorrow so I can get some work done before I have to go - which the computer is going to have to be off by 9:30am so I can get everyone ready, out the door, and down to my aunt's house by 10:30am or so. I won't be home&nbsp;until probably 3pm or so,&nbsp;then&nbsp;Anita and I are hosting a chat at 4pm. I'm hoping I can talk my mom into picking up my kids so I can at least have&nbsp;a little quite time to get major work done.   Now.....time for bed! &nbsp;

      Yes I know I'm no where even near done with Mom's Market Shops, but I HAD to get some work done on Soy Wax Candles. That site is another that's been driving me nuts and was in need of an update. There's new products to be added, and some major work to be done with the template and TONS of new pages to add, since I've decided to put each product on individual pages. Lots of work yes, but I'm doing this for SEO purposes. I do realise I'm going to have to do some more promotional work on this site, which I'm not looking forward to, but that's alright I can take a day to do it. Shouldn't take me too long to do, and it should be worth it.   Aside from getting quite a bit of work done, we certainly had "one of those days". While waiting for the repair man to show up to fix our AC, we had a storm come and knock out of electricity. What a perfect time -&nbsp;as if it wasn't hot enough in here! I couldn't even run a fan!&nbsp;Apparently it only effected my half of town, as the other half's lights came right back on. How lucky! No, what was really lucky was the fact the repair man showed up 5 minutes after our lights came back on. Boy any earlier and we would have had some REAL problems! I should also be thankful it didn't get real hot until later in the afternoon after the air was fixed. When the lights were out it was still in the lower 70s, so it wasn't too terrible in here (just a little humid because of the storms).&nbsp; I'm also lucky it only cost me $95 to get the freon charged - it could have cost a lot more.   Well tomorrow is going to be yet another busy day. I would like to finish up the candle website and also get as much work done on Mom's Market as I possibly can so that by Friday I can at least get started on the recipe website. I made some very nice purchases today of recipes that I can resell, so those should keep me very busy for quite awhile! I just can't waite to get started on these!   I'm thinking strongly about purchasing a few cheap $5 templetes to use instead of attempting to build these websites myself. I'm somewhat satisfied with the work I did on the candle site, but think it could be a LOT better. I am no artist, I'm the tweeking queen! Give me a templete and I'll tweek it to the point where it won't look anything like the original but functions the way I want it to. One of these days I'm just going to have to break down and buy a program like DreamWeaver and actually learn it so I can build professional websites. Then again if I can buy templetes at $5 who cares? I have better things to do with my time so best to outsource the things I'm not good at. ;)   Well now, it's way past working hours, but I wanted to come back on for a bit to write about my day. :) Until tomorrow!   ~Kara

       Yup, there's no doubt about it!&nbsp; I'm officially addicted to online auctioning.&nbsp; And nope, it's not Ebay.&nbsp; It's  urlLink MomPack Auctions  as I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; You can't beat it!&nbsp; It's FR*EE (yes, that is one of my favorite words!)&nbsp; I spent majority of my day setting up auctions.&nbsp; I tend to be a "neat freak" and a perfectionist when it comes to those types of things.&nbsp; No, I'm not saying in anyway that I'm perfection (cause I'm the farthest thing from that!) But, I love tweaking things and making things look just perfect (for me anyway).&nbsp;

      Well the goal of today was to swap out links and do some general updating for 3 of the mini-shops at Mom's Market Shops. Eh, after several exhasting hours I managed to get one done. We will see tomorrow and Thursday if the changes made today made a good enough empact to swap out more.  &nbsp;  The reason for swaping out links was because I noticed something yesterday. Amazon, which carries many of the same products&nbsp;as Nick.com,&nbsp;converts better. I took a&nbsp;good look at my&nbsp;total click throughs, and then at&nbsp;number of products ordered. Wouldn't you know&nbsp;Amazon contributes to twice as many sales as Nick.com when compairing&nbsp;clicks to sales.&nbsp;I have a pretty good idea why too. There's several reasons. One, Amazon carries more products. That's a pretty obvious one. Ok, even still&nbsp;if someone is looking for a specific product, other products don't always catch their attention.&nbsp;But! Two,&nbsp;Nick.com is CONSTANTLY out of stock of popular items, and have a very ugly "product currently out of stock" page, with no "sugestions" for other products that are similar (partially due to not having near as many similar products as Amazon). Last but not least, Amazon has a nifty option - "Quick-Click"(TM Amazon)&nbsp;buying links I can add to my pages. Perfect. I did a little figuring last night and found that those links have a higher convertion rate than just product links. Hmmmmm ok, good to know!  &nbsp;  Now the down side of Amazon is if it isn't a direct purchase (meaning they click on my link, then add the product to their shopping cart) I only receive 5% of the sale instead of Nick.com's 6%. Then again when you see twice as many products sold and direct purchases paying 7.5% this makes up for it, since a good majority of my purchase are direct purchases anyway! Not only that, but Amazon pays very nice bonuses for top earners. Granted it takes quite a few items to be shipped before bonuses kick in, but when they do it's well worth it.  &nbsp;  So let's see, Amazon - twice as many products sold at higher commission - works for me!  &nbsp;  Aside from getting at least one section updated (something like 8 or 9 pages), I got the main article done for tomorrow's issue of the  urlLink Ezine  . Although I had to stop halfway through to take the kiddos outside. Waaay too hot today NOT to go swimming, plus they are talking rain the rest of the week. Today might have been our only day out! Sooooo anyway, after playing outside then comming in for supper I had to of course finish the article, which is why I'm sitting here at 7:30pm. It's been a productive day though and the kids &amp; I had our together time so I feel good (just really tired!).  &nbsp; Just crossing my fingers we can survive the heat tonight - the AC is low on freon yet again (I've been positive there is a leak somewhere, since we have lived not even 5 years and this will be the 3rd time we've had to charge it - last time being early last summer), so it's not keeping the house as cool as it should and working over time just to keep it under 80. I shouldn't complain, it's not too bad in here right at the moment but if it doesn't cool down soon it could be a really terrible night. At least it's cooler in here than outside, and with a little luck the repair man will be here tomorrow to slap me with a multi-hundred dollar repair bill after it's finished. Beats suffering the heat I suppose, but wow not exactly an expence I was expecting this month. Darn, just when I thought that credit card was going to be paid off this month........*sigh* &nbsp; Well, now it's bath time so I had better scoot! &nbsp; ~Kara

      Not a real big update, but I did manage to find time today to "touch up" the home page on Mom's Market. Ah, so much work to be done and I just don't know WHEN to do it all! I spent&nbsp; quite a bit of time on some message boards and just doing some general searching, and realised I need to make some changes to my shops where my affiliate programs are. I think if I could take a little time to work on that, it&nbsp;would make a huge difference in my income. At the same time though I'm very anxious to get started on another website idea of mine and would like to be working on it tomorrow if I can.  &nbsp; I realise I'm going to have to do a major search for recipes, not only for my new website idea but for the ezine too. I have some very old family recipes comming my way, so I may see if I can get them touched up and use them. That way I wouldn't need to find so many (believe me, I have a HUGE list, and I'm no where NEAR done with what I plan to do with that new site!).  &nbsp; Well let's see, aside from Mom's Market still needing updates and me wanting to get that new website started, I noticed another website that needed my attention over the weekend. Oh yeah, just what I needed! Well ok, no biggie - I can do this. May have to put it off until next month though. Surely it won't take me too long to do, even though I basically have to take down the entire site and re-do the entire thing. Really, I WILL get it done! I'm shooting for this week too. It's just going to take a little organizing and I *think* I can manage to get 1 site updated, 1 site re-built, and 1 brand new one build. I imagin if I can just keep rolling I can manage everything.  &nbsp; Off to make out a full "To-do" list for tomorrow! &nbsp; ~Kara &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

          Oooh, what fun!&nbsp; I've been following a couple of posts about ebay at a couple of message forums that piqued my interest.&nbsp; I had given ebay a small whirl in the past and just hadn't gotten the results I was looking for so, kind of gave it up.&nbsp; I really didn't have the extra time to "learn" it.&nbsp; Now ebay's fees are getting a bit crazy and I didn't feel like eating up the "test" in fees.&nbsp; So, I decided to give  urlLink MomPack Auctions  a try.&nbsp; Well, I have to admit.&nbsp; I've had up to 4 listings so far and it's been kind of fun.&nbsp; Oh, yeah..and its free ;)&nbsp; AND...well, let's say it was kind of fun watching my first auction go back and forth between two people for a bit then all of the sudden right before it was over Bahm! Someone snuck in and took it!&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp; But, yeah...it was kind of funny to watch that.&nbsp; Sorry!

      Pages done and banner ad creation underway - a good day I think. Anita and I managed to get quite a bit of advertising done too, and hope to see some vendors and sponsors signing up. Still feel like there is more I could have done today, but ah well. Looks like I'm going to take at least part of next week to work more on Mom's Market because I haven't got a new idea for the site started nor have I&nbsp; updated the home page like I wanted to. Plus I want to help Anita with some SEO work on Mommy's Helper, so yeah looks like I'm going to have to take another week. No biggie I suppose, since I might be able to squeeze some time in to get another website started. My hobbie site and addition to it can waite for another week - I just don't know if I can haha.  &nbsp; Ahhhhhh it feels good to know it's Friday though, and there's no pressure to get anything done or answer emails this weekend. I need breaks just like anyone else! &nbsp; ~Kara

      Well I'm pleased. I got a little bit of a late start today, since I had to make a run to Walmart and bumped into a few friends that I needed to chat with for awhile. That's the great thing about working at home and not having set hours to work - I can take an extra long lunch and chat with friends I don't get to talk to very often.  &nbsp;  I shouldn't really say I got a late start though, because I did manage to get through all my email this morning and hit a few boards before I left. When I got back though is when I really got to work - getting the networking event pages finished. Ok mostly.&nbsp; I realise we are also going to have to contact Nola from  urlLink Classic Creations  to do a banner ad for us that we can use not only on the home page of the event but for advertising too. I'm excited to get this started, so I can hardly waite!  &nbsp; I do feel a little guilty sitting here past 8pm just finishing up, but well I WAS gone for a good chunk of the afternoon, so it's not like I was neglecting my family or "me" time. I did all that earlier when I went to lunch and to Walmart.&nbsp; Plus now I'm off to get to the "me and only me" time since the kids are in bed for the night. I love a quiet house :)  &nbsp; ~Kara &nbsp;

      Here I had plans to do all kinds of promotional work with Mom's Market, even make some changes and update pages, but I keep comming up with one idea after another. Anita and I did some brainstorming today on another event, which I'll be excited to get started within in the next few days. I just hope I have enough timenext week to do some work on my hobby site. Sadly I may not, because there is another website idea I would like to get started. My hobby site may once again take the back seat to big business. *sigh* One of these days I swear I'll finish it, and make it a money maker too. I found a little extra time last week and ran with a few ideas, so that pleased me temporarily until I can do some real work to them.   I suppose this week hasn't been too terrible so far - I managed to work on the advertising information page, update the  urlLink Back To School  section on Mom's Market, as well as write an article and get it submitted to various places. I did get a section of the shops updated as well, so that also pleased me.   Today I think I may take off just a bit early, and take the kids outside to play. I got a little side tracked playing with my CD collection. Eh, oops. Well what would you do if you found a CD that had been missing for 3 years and was one of your favorites? What can I say, I love music.  Tomorrow I think I'll start working on the new event we have planned for September, and also another idea that's just starting. I think I would feel good about working on those ideas, not to mention that it really is direct promotion and improvement of Mom's Market.   Well the children are getting restless, asking every 2 seconds if it's time to go out yet - I had better get going!  ~Kara

      Well, yes I guess I have been MIA for a while.  Just from here and what seems to be every other form of networking available (and yes, that makes a big difference!)  Just to catch up on where I've been...  I've been here without a doubt and working my toosh off.  Opening  urlLink HomeBusinessSpecialists.com   and  urlLink HomeFreelanceJobs.com  had turned out to be a bit more than I could handle right off that bat.  I can't believe the response we had gotten for the Freelance Jobs site!  One part of my "job" in this mix was to handle all the incoming applications.  Making sure we had all the information required, reviewing samples...just basically making sure everything was in line and the applicants were fit for the job they were requesting.  Okay...well this is a whole new work load added to my regular work...I've managed though, just needed a bit more re-arranging of my schedule.  Unfortunately, my networking had suffered as I changed things around.  One thing that surely didn't help is that I pretty much had to take off most of last week.  I ended up with an infected tooth. :( Whoa!  Do you know what an infection in your mouth can do to your face?!?!  Literally, I looked like someone had stuck a baseball in my cheek! (Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating just a bit..but really, not that much!)  Yes, very painful!  So, the dentist gave me some pain killers...Yeah, that gave me that gave me two choices...work in pain or sleep?!?  Needless to say for a while I had to choose the sleep. :(  BUT, I did do a lot of work in the meantime.  Between my "regular workload" and my "new workload" I was busy doing as much research on Affiliate Marketing as I could.  (Fun, and interesting learning experience I might add) I was thrilled to see the final product of all my hard work which became  urlLink Affiliate Marketing Information Network !  The fruits of my hard work showed off nicely.  (Yeah, tooting my own horn just a bit!)  I also had the pleasure of watching  urlLink MommysHelperOnline.com  grow to a new level as it reached the "milestone" of a PR5 on Google!  That made me realize just how much Mommy's Helper needed just a bit of a face lift.  Just few changes here and there.  I had realized that my home page was taking entirely too long to load (which also can hurt you) so, I did a little re-arranging (with-out completely changing everything) of my home page and of course my advertising page was in dire need of some help.  Oh and yes!  I decided it was time I learned something about online auctioning so, I placed my first advertising listing at the new  urlLink MomPack Auctions  I look forward to putting up more and more auctions there.  Actually, my first one ends in a few hours and it was sort of a learning experience for me.    Soooo, yes...I've been MIA but I've also been working.  Time to get back to Networking! After the ezine gets out today of course ;)

      This week as planned I'll be working on Mom's Market. It's been a trying day to say the least, what with all the interuptions and problems arising. My roof began leeking after yesterday's storms, so part of today was spent making phone calls and getting estimates on how much it's going to cost to tear off and re-roof the back part of the house. Lovely!   Of course on top of this mess, the children have been in extra amounts of trouble today. I had a can of pop dumped on the floor and the blinds in the living room came crashing down (snapping the top part, so the entire blind will need to be replaced - funny this had to happen AFTER we came back from Walmart).   Aside from everything that's happend, I've managed to at least get through my email. That was done in between interuptions, messes, and punishments. I had hoped to work on the "Back to School" page for Mom's Market, but that just didn't happen. I took a quick look at it though, and fixed a few minor problems so it's "good enough" for the time being until I can get some real work done on it. Which is going to have to be tomorrow since supper is almost finished. I at least have a game plan of what I need to do to update that section.   On top of the revision of the current section, I've got an article to write. I'm thinking tomorrow shouldn't be so terrible, since I don't have to go to Walmart (that darn blind is just going to have to waite until Wednesday or Thursday!) and there shouldn't be as many interuptions. Email also shouldn't be as bad since today was catch up from the weekend.   Important thing here is to stay calm, stick to my work schedual, and get as much done as I possibly can. *deep breath* .....wow what a day.  ~Kara

      Well, I still feel like there's a few things I've missed and didn't get done, but can't think of what they are right now. We signed our first client, and waiting to hear from quite a few who have been given quotes. An article was done, lists compiled, new ideas put into works, and a few link exchanges. Ok, so it really WAS a good week.   Really the promotion isn't done, and really never will be. But much has been put into motion for the next several months (such as a list of article ideas to write and submit, and a signature line created for all groups and message boards I visit often).   Next week I'm anxious to get back to Mom's Market for a little bit, will do some updating and work on a new advertising idea. The top priority for next week is getting my "back to school" page in order. I know it seems early, but I noticed today the old page I had up that's no longer linked is sitting at #3 for "Back to School Supplies", and starting to recieve quite a few visitors (I looked this morning, and saw over 50 for the week so far).   Right now I'm letting out a big sigh of relief that it's Friday, and email  has been closed for the day. I really do like business, but just like a true working woman I can't waite for the weekend so I can take it all off my mind. I try to block it all out, and not let email make me feel guilty because let's face it - we all need breaks. Many don't realise how important taking time here and there for yourself and your family really is. I found out the hard way last summer when I spent every day (yes every single day!) working from the time I got up until very very late at night. One Saturday while attempting to finish a few projects I began to get a headache (mostly from stress, and all the long hours with little sleep). I tried to ignore it, sure I absolutely needed to finish my project or I'd fall behind. Well the head ache turned into a migrane and I got seriously ill. It took me out for several days. After that I vowed I would shut the computer off at a certain time (or at least stop working) at a certain time. To this day I still have a cut off time.   And speaking of which, it's that time! Enjoy the weekend!  ~Kara

      Well now, my search for business directories didn't go over very well today. The ones I did find were a little pricey for us right now, but that's ok. I've bookmarked them and will be comming back to submit Home Business Specialists at a later date. I did manage to find some very high targeted link exchanges that I'm happy with. I'll continue that tomorrow if I have time, or Thursday even. I also got an article writting, and Anita & I got the ezine ready to send out tomorrow. All this on top of answering countless emails and the daily networking.   Tomorrow's main priority is making a giant master list of places to advertise, and also a list to submit articles. Of course I'm going to work on submitting my own link and articles to these places.   I'd say today was a productive day, and I just hope tomorrow is as well. :)  ~Kara

      Somewhat of a rocky start to the day I must admit.....I forgot to set my alarm last night, so slept in with the kids and woke up rather late. Immediately got a call from my mother who wanted to drag me off to Walmart earlier than normal. So I got maybe 45 mins of work in this morning. It was 2 in the afternoon before I got home and back to work - so here I sit at 10 til 7 still finishing up a few tasks before spending some time with the kids.   While I still got quite a bit done today such as some networking and changing my signature line to refect the opening of Home Business Specialists, I still have un-checked items on my to-do list and that always drives me nuts. Must be why I stopped making out to-do lists there for awhile. :/  I must admit I got a bit side tracked while visiting the last message board of the day. Mike from IM4Newbies posted an excellent list of places to  urlLink submit your blog , so I spent probably a good hour or two (in between cooking supper) working on that. Funny I was just thinking about looking for directories and there it was on Mike's boards. What a fantastic find. :)  I'm off to make out my list of tasks to do tomorrow, which should be twice as long as today's. Tomorrow I should have less interupted time though, so should prove to be better.  ~Kara

      Well I had planned on doing some promotional work on Home Business Specialists right after our grand opening Thursday and Friday, but much to my surprise the announcement we made in the newsletter kept me busy answering emails and giving job estimates. Plus of course I was busy this weekend with 4th of July activities, but managed to make a "to do" list before a family breakfast this morning. I bought another notebook at Walmart just the other day, and plan on using it just for ideas and plans for the various website I own/co-own.   Soooooo, anyway.....  This week is dedicated to working on promotion on Home Business Specialists. First I'm going to go in and edit my signature lines at many of the board I frequent to reflect the new site. I also need to edit my Ryze page and spend a little time there. Then, I'm going to contact a few website owners about a home page link exchange. I do believe that Anita already has one lined up I just need to contact her. Next I'll search for some directories to get listed in. Finally I'll get a few articles finished and work on sending them out to as many places as I can possibly find. It's been quite awhile since I've written any articles at all, so I may have to spend a little extra time finding new places to send the articles to. I might pull out of a few older articles, change the byline to include HBS, then send them to the new places I find.   That should be plenty to keep me busy this week, but hopefully by next week I'll be able to pay a little more attention to Mom's Market and a few other projects I've got in the back of my head.   ~Kara

      Yes by posting here I'm buying time. Procrastinating. Putting off what I know should be done. For some reason I just don't want to do anything. Well, I DO, but games are calling me saying "come on...you know you need a day off!". Hey, after all I DID get the press release sent out for the " urlLink Stay at Home with Your Kids Day ".  Also while I'm staring at my list of things I wanted to accomplish this week (which my black dry erase marker died last night, so today's list is in a bright blue and bugging me very badly), I keep thinking of OTHER things that I could do. Which I suppose I should just go with what is calling me as long as it's productive. But then that silly "To-do list" haunts me. Saying "Hey! Slacker! You didn't do everything this week!".   *Sigh*  I have to wonder, when you work for yourself and just absolutely DO NOT want to do anything, is it ok to take a mini vacation? Do we all need time to relax (other than the weekend), and regroup? How productive can we really be if we are contantly burned out?   Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, and just trying to come up with an excuse to go play games. Maybe I'm just stressing too much over what needs to be accomplished this month (both online and with family stuff).  Done rambling for now...

      If I didn't accomplish anything else this week, I'd be happy with getting the affiliate section done for my recipe ebooks. Earlier I found that nice code so I could use multiple landing pages for my ClickBank account. So today I finally finished up getting the code in order on my site, and built a brand new section just for affiliates (so that there wasn't anyway my affiliates would loose out on sales from my own paypal payment buttons or links to other items I sell as an Amazon affiliate on RecipesForMom.com). You can see the special pages I set up here:  urlLink http://www.momsmarketonline.com/recipe-ebooks.html .  I also set up a page for the affiliates to learn about the affiliate program and get links to use for various pages on that special section. The links that need to be used are a little different from normal ClickBank links, but I've tested them to make sure affiliates get credit for their sales.  While it's certaintly been a trying week, I'm happy to at least gotten that done. Tomorrow for some reason seems like "National Take the Day Off Work" day and I don't know why. I was suppose to help my mom at the restaurant, but since my step dad got the day off so do I. YIPPIE! What odd is another friend of mine somehow just got the day off too. Weird how those things happen, eh? Well must be for my birthday, which is Saturday. Hehe - Just joking of course, but that is somewhat odd.

       What is spam?  The definition of spam can be very simple.  Unsolicited email.  Plain and simple.  Information sent to my email that I didn't request.  I don't care if you're offering a special, affiliate program or business opportunity.  Spam is spam is spam.        We all get spam from time to time and probably more often than not. Usually I simply delete the email and move on.   Today for some reason I decided to not delete this specific email.  One reason might have been the fact that it was sent out in a small mass.  There was quite a little list of everyone who recieved this same spam.  Of course not hiding everyone else's email address either.   Here is what the email said:    "I have a new group that I have been working on for a while now.  I think this will work.  I am only taking one person from one business.  SO apply fast.  When the spot is full you will be denied. This is to help those in business become successful. Thanx     XXXX"    I've left out the name of the writer of course.  I do have to mention though, I haven't left out the link.  The link wasn't even in it?!?  I simply replied with a  "Please do not spam me".   To in which was replied with  "I did not spam you...I sent the message to the whole group."    I then copied and pasted where she had sent it to my own personal email address and not a group.      Now, this is where you have to be careful of what you do and say again (Just as Kara had mentioned in an earlier post here) online.  I honestly believe my simple response of  "Please do not spam me"  was handled very nicely.  Little does this person know what could actually be done to her for things like this.  The response I was given was very unprofessional and the way she handles her business shined right through.  I was not so nicely told that she was not spamming me, she was simply sharing a Business Opportunity and how wrong it was to accuse her of spam.      Okay, okay...I'll stop with the back and forth and back and forth because it does get much worse.  Apparently this person is not aware of what spam is and isn't.  Hmmm...shall we even try to figure out how many business opportunities are available on the internet?  Nearly impossible to even guess.  Let's just say for example that there were only 1000 business opportunities available. (Don't we all wish)  Now, spam is legal and all 1000 people are allowed to just email any ole one with their business opp.  Need I say more??

      I got a not so nice suprise today - it seems KBToys decided to start using LinkShare instead of Commission Juntion for it's affiliate program. While this may not seem like a big deal to the average shopper, it's a huge deal to the affiliates. Those that have used KBToys links had to either remove or change ever single code. Luckily, I only had one mini-shop Mom's Market that I spent a lot of time adding KBToy links to and several other pages that only had a product or two from them.   So today while I thought I was going to get some time to work on RecipesForMom.com, I ended up updating several pages on Mom's Market. Did I sign up to KBToys affiliate program on Link Share? NOPE. Even though they were offering a higher percentage now, I said NO THANK YOU. Why? Because I was not happy they decided on a whim to pull all their links and create an ugly "this merchant is no longer a part of Commission Juntion" page from all my links to them. Also, their conversion rate was very low, and I know while the percentage is now less with Amazon, I can sell more from Amazon. This merchant has dissapointed me, as I'm sure it has many other affiliates.   On top of moving, they gave the affiliates about 5 days to change links. I never even received a notice, and only really discovered that the links where dead when a potential customer emailed me to inquire about a product. On further investigating, I realised that in the last week (the affiliate program on CJ closed July 30th) there were over 1,000 clicks to KB Toys dead links. Thats several potential sales (well, ha, maybe....KB Toys never has converted that well so maybe it didn't make a difference).  Anyway, the bottom line is I'm very upset about the way KB Toys has handled their move, and kept the affiliates in the dark. All links that I could find have been removed from my site, and I won't be using them as a merchant again.  ~Kara

      Well, today I wanted to finish another ebook and get some more link exchanges done, but I didn't do either.  What I did figure out how to do and almost got completely set up today was how to have multiple landing pages for ClickBank products. See, when you sell a product with Clickbank and have affiliates, with their codes you only have one page that your affiliates can use to promote. This is a real problem for those that have multiple products and want to give their affiliates the option of selling each product instead of just having one page their affiliates can use.   This code must be set up on the domain where the products are, but once in place affiliates can be given several different links to use to sell products for that merchant. PERFECT! I was afraid I was going to have to set up a brand new Clickbank account and put all the recipe ebooks on one page - NOT what I wanted to do, since for one the convertion rate would have been lower for my affiliates, but it would have cost me $50 on top of that. Now with this code I can give my affiliates the option of promoting just each individual product, but the only thing is I'm going to have to work a little bit harder to make a nice affiliate area will all the correct links. That I don't mind doing at all though, since I want to give my affiliates every advantage possible and earn them more. (Hey, they make money = I make money. Win-win situation!)  Soooo, I'm going to have to take some time next week and make sure everything is up and running for those that are wanting to join the affiliate program. Of course I also have many many more ebooks to finish, and several more link exchanges to do, so that's going to be a challenge as well!

       Some people will do just about anything to get other's ganders up, have a little fun and maybe (I don't see how they could possibly believe this one) they actually think they'll get a few extra visits to their website! One of the first emails I read this morning was from a concerned member of my   urlLink  message boards    letting me know that someone had posted spam there. As I was getting ready to go to my boards I had noticed that there were quite a few emails there pretty much saying the same thing. By now I've figured out that these messages must have been of some magnitude because we're all used to a little spam but...what was this about?  After visting my boards I quickly realized WHY so many people had so quickly emailed me. Some non-friendly (for lack of more unprofessional words!) spammer had posted some links to websites of an adult nature! Quickly (Kara and) I found the IP Number of the offender, banned that number and of course deleted the post. I found it necessary to apologize to my loyal members for such messages to appear. I started the long process of changing each and every forum to allow only registered members to post. While I was doing this the spammer had the guts to read my apology and post many many more posts of the same nature! (Of course now I threatened to bring in the authorities!)  So, now I've wasted a good part of my morning changing the administration of the boards and making it an inconvience for someone to stop by and post anything of revelance with out first registering. I didn't want to have to resort to such measures but, what choice do I really have? I'm not stupid enough to believe that that this will stop the spam but I do believe it will put a little more control over it. It's a shame that I'd have to do something like this! I mean did this person REALLY believe that a bunch of work at home moms were going to visit this site?

      Recently I came in contact with a rather interesting situation. I won't go into details or mention who was involved, but there were at least 3 or 4 handling a rather rude and unprofessional person. What she didn't know is all her emails were being circulated to even more close business friends that were somewhat involved. Of course there are 2 sides to every story, but when you see how the story unfolds in emails you tend to be able to form educated opinions on the situation and each person involved.   What's worse is this person handles a large networking group, where the members have no idea how this person has behaving or what her real motives are. It's possible these members could be hurt because of programs they are involved with being associated in this person.   So anyway, becareful how you handle yourself even in a one on one email - you never know who may see it, or who it may be passed to. Also, watch who you follow. Don't believe everything they tell you just because they have a lot of "followers". Do your own research and seek advice from many different experts, especially when the "leader" has something to gain from their advice to you.  ~Kara

       Ta Da! I've decided to give  MommysHelperOnline.com  a bit of a face lift. This is something I've been wanting to accomplish for quite some time...just hadn't know exactly where I wanted to go with it. And since my recent battle with what my target market was and finally got it limited down a bit, it's actually helped. I can't say that I have really changed my target market though. Wahms are still my target and I can't get around that. It is such a diverse group but...thats what it is. BUT...I did manage to find more of a "direction" of my site. And I pretty much have to thank the ezine design for that because thats the direction my site started to take on too. Now, the definition of MommysHelperOnline.com is like this:

      I finally decided to get serious about this new auction site, and join Anita in promoting some products and advertising space. Just before the  urlLink Ezine  went out today, I set up my  urlLink About Me  page, then put up two auctions for advertising spaces and one for the last recipe ebook I finished. The auctions are as follows:    urlLink Site Sponsor Ad  1 month "Site Sponsor" listing on home page of Mom's Market. Normally $40 for 1 month, the auction starts at $9.99.    urlLink Featured Business Ad  2 weeks as exclusive "Featured Business" on home page of Mom's Market. Normally $30 for 2 weeks, the auction starts at $9.99   urlLink Chocolate Lovers Ebook  Over 600 recipes, all including chocolate. This ebook sells for $17.95 on RecipesForMom.com, but this special auction starts at $9.99. I figured with this one since the ebook is new I would give the option of buying it for a low price in this auction.   That's all for now. I don't want to spend too much time on these auctions just yet until I know for sure how well they will go. Just like at eBay, I know I'll have to advertise these auctions a bit for bids because it's not automatic. At least with Mom Pack Auctions there are no fees to set up a basic listing, and no fees involved if you don't sell the item. I never liked that about ebay, and it was becoming a real problem when I was making only a $1 or 2. My time was better spent doing other things! Hopefully this new auction site will be more worth my time and worth the time for my advertising manager.   I'll be watching these auctions closely and reporting how they do. :)  ~Kara Kelso~

      In my previous post I mentioned the Mom Pack link exchange network. Turns out that it's classified as a "link farm" to Google, therefor I'm pulling my links and won't be using it. I wondered, and had a gut feeling that something wasn't quite right about it.   Internet marketing is fun, isn't it?   ~Kara Kelso

      Well even though I don't have the free recipes up yet for this ebook, I did at least get the entire Chocolate Lovers package done today and all set up. That I'm happy with, although I'm afraid I may have worked a little too hard on getting it finished. I can feel myself slipping into that old habit of working myself to death to get projects finished. I did this last summer too, and should have learned my lesson back then. Although I still have been pulling away from work to give myself enough time to make a good supper for the kids, then sit down with them until their bed time. I did sneak online for just a little bit between after supper and bath time (hey, my youngest fell asleep so I let her sleep until bath time - we had a rough night last night and I'm not sure why).   I found a nifty little resource that really I've known about for quite some time but decided to give it a shot. It's a basic idea of a link exchange except with a whole network. If you haven't heard of  urlLink Mom Pack , they are the ones offering the giant link exchange network. I do worry a bit about how it looks to the search engines and what it does for backward links, but I'm going to observe and see if it does effect anything. I know Anita has had this link exchange network up on  urlLink Mommy's Helper  for some time now, and just glancing at her backward links I spoted 5 from that network. Not too bad, exspecially when you figure that each member is required to do an update every 6 months. Wish I would have tried this one out before.   Aside from link exchanges and recipes, Anita mentioned something very interesting in her last post here. Target market! I do like that topic, because it's something that doesn't cross our minds very much. I know I had to really think for a long time with Mom's Market, because for awhile I was targeting the wrong market. I was stressing the fact the stores listed where mom run, but honestly for mothers not in business why would they care? So my target was shifted to mothers with young children, and focusing on what THEY need. Not just wahms, but any mother with young children. The title says it all - "Online Shopping Mall for Busy Mothers". Those that don't want to drag their kids to the mall, that want the easy and comfort of shopping from home but with the personal customer service that can only be given by sympathetic mothers (that is somewhat of a bold statement, and possibly somewhat biast to men, but I believe there is a bit of truth in it). Anita mentioned some intresting questions like "what makes my site different?". Well, I think I already answered that question. Not only is it a mall specifically for mothers, but it's filled with unique, mother run stores. Sure there are other copy cat sites, but I've seen the others and they are no where as large at Mom's Market. The last count was over 300 UNIQUE stores (not including duplicate direct sales company reps). Ah, I may be rambling just a bit, but that's what this blog is for right? Even with all this rambling, I think the topic of target markets could further be discussed and I could use to think about it just a bit more too.   ~Kara Kelso~

      Well, now thats a pretty easy question, right?  Isn't it?  Well, I thought it would be.  Until I was asked that question and didn't know how to answer.  Of course I always could answer with "wahm" or "work at home moms" which IS my Target Market, right?  Well, yeah...but, boy oh boy thats a pretty large Market isn't it?  And each and every wahm has a different business, different reason for working at home, looking for different advertising, looking for different information....How can I provide all thats needed for that large of a group with such a diverse outlook and needs?   Okay, so there's also how many other "Wahm Resources Sites" out there?  What makes mine so special?  What makes my visitors want to come back day after day or week after week?  The sad part is I don't know!  How many others don't know?  How can we be running successful online businesses if we don't know who our target people are and in which case then don't know how to fill the void those people are looking for?  Yikes!  What a question?  (and a few more)  Now, thats some food for thought!  (Yeah, I'm learning a thing or two over at  urlLink MomMasterMinds  ;) )
