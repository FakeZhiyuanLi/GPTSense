      Well I'm coming down from a crazy weekend of wedding tears, rehearsals, drinks, dancing (alot) and birthday parties with kiddies and sweat. Katie and Dan's wedding was a BLAST - although the weather was hot we all hung in there. Was a short but amazingly sweet ceremony and we all had tears in our eyes as Dan started to give his vows.  The reception was fun! We all tore up the small dance floor and the bridesmaids, esp Michelle "Slutty-eri", were soaking their dresses with sweat and spilled cosmos. Things got a little nutty when Nirvana came on. I think my toes got stepped on alot. And, today my calves hurt. But it was an amazing night and we all made alot of memories. We took silly pics and were generally ridiculous.  Today I left the goodbye bfast for K and D and then went to my niecs, Hannah's third bday. There was a carnival theme and I was the face painter. The moonbouce was amazingly tiring but exciting. All the kids went in the pool and I sat in the shade like an old lady.  So hence another weekend gone...But here are some fun web reads for the day-  More fun with  urlLink Courtney Love   All these people and thier motivation to  urlLink craft !  Amazing  urlLink chocolates  that Katie gave to all her bridesmaids

      Right now I'm enjoying every American's right - Not working. I'm at the boy's house while he is at work bc I have to be at the wedding rehearsal at 2 oclock. Joy. So the inner-net is my new friend.  Some cool stuff:   urlLink Cheap-ass mags!!!  Now I can be well informed and have more clutter - for cheaper.  I've rejoined up with the GetCrafty/Glitter crown at  urlLink SuperNaturale.com   Steve's  urlLink LiveJournal  is a trip into the deep recesses of his mind.

      I'm kinda obsessed now with some of the  urlLink Jantzen  ads from the 50's on  urlLink this site  . But there are plenty of things here for everyone.    Like I was saying to Kelly, cute toast things are the cows for the 00's. Remeber when everything was about cows? And Spuds Mackenzie? Well. We think that burnt bread is the new thing.  urlLink Old toasters   urlLink Toast Doll

      Was reading the Inky today and came across an article on urlLink PhillyFreeCycle , where peeps can get together and give away their junk to those who need it. Pretty Cool. There are also sites for the burbs and counties in the area.  On the same note is  urlLink Please Take Materials Exchange  in Philly.   When is  urlLink Re-Store  going to get an online shop going? Argh.  But the  urlLink Architectural Antiques Exchange  does...

      Some cool happenings in my favorite town:   This weekend is the  urlLink Italian Market Festival . Or 9th Street for those in the know.   Michelle B. posted  urlLink some pics  of K and D's wedding and other sorted events. Check out the photos from Katie's Bacherlorette party. You will see pics of Patrick, our plastic little friend. We had a good ol time at Bally's in AC. We rocked out at the lounge old school style.  Anyhoo I'm glad she posted the pics and is a blogger freak too, kinda. Her blog site is  urlLink luxurious.  She has some nice photos. I'm jealous that I cant post pics more often b/c I'm using a Mac and the photo-poster-thing only works on PC's. Dannggitt!   More cool  urlLink Philly photos from the past  that feature old ads     urlLink Neat-o art thing at the Mütter  that I wont get to bc I have a job: Friday June 4, 1pm A thematic tour on "nothing" of the artists' works and the collection by Gretchen Worden, Director of the Mütter Museum, and ICA's Tanya Leighton.   These are all the galleries that are participating in  urlLink "The Big Nothing" ICA Gallery thingie . I love the ICA, but I don't ever get up there. First Friday rolls around and I'm usually sleepie.

Actually, now that I look on-line there is alot of criticism out there on him. But - why is it ok to criticize him and not the leaders of our country?

          Since my last bike got nicked (may it rest in peace-and may the bastard that stole it rot in hell) I am taking charge this time and keeping my new ride indoors. I am also going to register it with KryptoLok and the   Philadelphia Police  . Buy maybe there is a basement in the Alamo and my bike is there, safe and happy.      I also took it out for a stroll this past weekend, inspired by the  urlLink Tour de France . Eric and I did the loop around the river and it was nice to enjoy the finer parts of Philadelphia. Lately I really haven't been in love with the City of Brotherly Hate, so it was a cathartic ride. We ended our ride in Rittenhouse square with wobbly legs and me with a sweaty bum, but I was thinking that this isn't such a bad place after all. Then the people next to us started smoking cigars...    And when I can afford a second bike I'm going to get it from  urlLink Momovelo.

        Every where I look there are men with white beards all over the place! Last nite I saw a man with red suspenders, a long furry beard and some missing teeth. And plastic knee pads. What were the pads for? This morning - I saw two more men with white beards and it's unknown if there were missing teeth. Maybe  urlLink white beards  are the  urlLink faux-hawks   of Summer '04?

      So, yah I haven't blogged for a while. I don't know why. Do people even read this damned thing? Just been lazy and haven't felt über inspired lately.    Bike got stolen from in front of my house last week. That totally stunk. But on the good side, I can now get a cool new bike. Thinking of getting a Giant. And sometimes I dream of living in a Fishtown thats not so ghetto. Blah.  I have no link for this. But thinking about Turbo in the movie  urlLink "Breakin"   makes me happy. FYI - The guy who plays turbo, Michael "Boogaloo Shrimp" Chambers, produced the movie "Kids". Hmm.   Let's see. This weekend we all took Adrienne out for her bacherlorette party, or BP as me and Caroline liked to call it. Was a blast and unfortunately there are ugly pics out there now on the web of me with chins. Not good. But anyhow they exist and I feel the need to post them  urlLink here . AND  urlLink here .  So after seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 I am now all political and what not.  Monica mad! This makes it all look like a  urlLink joke  though.
