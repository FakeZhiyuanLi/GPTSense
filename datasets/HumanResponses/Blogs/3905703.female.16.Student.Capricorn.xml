       A very bad day. Started with 3 periods of March Past, ooh what a pain.Standing and marching in this disgusting weather. Then,&nbsp;picked up a fight, was rude to almost everybody and missed Sinha's debate (by 3 mins,&nbsp;when I reached the AVH, Akash's had just finished, really frustating). Well, it should have been a nice day, as it was the BIRTHDAY of one of my very good friend's (Kanika's ).   So I think I will just wish Kanika a very   HAPPY BIRTHDAY..  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   A good thing which has happened in quite a few days,&nbsp;other than India winning the match against the Lankans, is that Mukesh Sir is back, which has been a blessing. I mean we have a Computers MT next week , and it was&nbsp; becoming quite a pain to have different teachers, who literally taught us nothing.    Coming to the match, I think Dada showed immense captaincy. And I am not saying that becoz he is a fellow Bengali. Whenever he made a bowling change,&nbsp;there was always a wicket taken. And though before the last ball, he was biting his nails and changing field positions at the last moment, the way he exulted after winning the match was a sight to be seen. The most unfortunate of things is that i have Fiitjee on Sunday, when they play the finals.   I really hope they win the finals, it will make them&nbsp;supreme in Asia .   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Firstly, a very  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  to  Sahiba  (25/07/04). May you grow more beautiful as the years pass by....    I was going to tell you about my eye checkup. Well that is part of the reason why I didn't write for two days. The other being the Indo Pak match. The whole Sunday whisked away in attending Fiitjee and then coming back home to see India hopelessly trudge a losen war (Sehwag went for 1, what else could you expect).   &nbsp; Anyhow, coming back to the eye checkup. I had thought that it would be a 15 min affair.I would just have to sit in front of a machine, and pat I would get my power (like it happens in Samay- I dont expect any of you to have heard about the movie, but I kinda liked it.). But no, I was thoroughly mistaken. After doing the routine checkup, I had to sit through 2 hrs of torture (well, its bit of a torture, to sit with your eyes closed for 2&nbsp; hrs). Yes, they were dilating my eyes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I managed the 2 hrs, but after coming home I could not see anything which was near and therefore could not sit on the computer. The next day when I got up, I could see the near objects but could not see the far ones.  I mean it was pathetic . I wasn't supposed to, but I watched the match, so it became worse...   Anyhow,&nbsp; I think I will be getting my glass powers by next Saturday.   Whenever, I think I will bunk March Past, I see Damini aka Head Girl. And oh boy, isn' t she&nbsp;&nbsp;angry with me for not attending March Past. So unwillingly we have to go and&nbsp;attend&nbsp;it with Mr. P.K. Sharma yelling out the goddamit commands.  Yes, I know some have been lucky but for&nbsp;others...   There are a lot of birthdays&nbsp;in these coming days, so look out .   &nbsp;

       I think the K section assembly was quite nice, especially that guy called Atiyindra (God knows if I have got the name right, but he is definitely a Bong). He was pretty good . I mean its tough to play the guitar as well as sing and that too a Bryan Adams number. Well, in this respect I think the Strings number, Sar Ki Ye Pahaar is marvellous (the guitarist sings the song as well).  &nbsp; Yes, I bunked the March Past to see the assembly (well Hema Jain mam is their class teacher and i wanted to kno what she was going to put up). And even Princi declared her as the Most Charming techer in the senior classes. &nbsp;Anyhow, Nisheeth please do not blabber in Physics about my voice. We get enough of it from Mrs. Shobhaa Mehta, who has perfected the art of making her students go to sleep. And unfortunately, my voice&nbsp;HAS revived.  I am going for an eye check up in the afternoon. (yup, my vision is blurred, half the times cannot make out what the teacher writes on the blackboard in school as well as in Fiitjee.)  Will write about it when I come back.  &nbsp;

       For most of the people today, the school was somewhat peaceful today. For the uninitiated, I have got a sore throat. I am literally croaking. Though , some people prefer it that way , I am really missing my voice. I cannot do the things which I like to do, for instance sing ( though tuneless). It gives me immense pleasure in irritating someone, though I think I do some good&nbsp;by&nbsp;keeping people around me informed about the latest happenings in the music world ,who are otherwise very engrossed in their studies.&nbsp;I miss yelling at Sinha too.  Now something about the March Past. ok, Manav and Abhinav (he is the other guy, Coordinator Mathematics Society) cannot march. They just can't. It was really hilarious seeing them get it right.  &nbsp; Yearning for my voice....... Manisha

       Ok, English finally became very interesting. No, not because of how Mrs. Nagarkar teaches, but because of what she was teaching. We started with Classified Ads, and the first thing that you think of is Matrimonials. Actually before starting on the writing skill, we were sitting idle for 15 mins. So we decided to ask some people about what they would write if they were looking for their partners&nbsp; ( sometime later in life). The best answer which we got was Ajay's which was - "I would like to have a wife with whom I could have an intellectually stimulating conversation." After this we all shut up. &nbsp; Another interesting thing is the new ,spiky haircut which Apoorv has got. Its obnoxious. Though some people beg to differ (eg. Priyam). Vijeta has also got spikes, though in his very interesting speech in the assembly he declared that having spikes is not what Gen X is all about , vagera vagera. &nbsp; Otherwise , life is still very dull.What with Physica and Chem still being very big bores... &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Hey, I just reread my last post and I thought it was too&nbsp; philosophical. But dont worry guys ,my blog wont be full of such stuff. Its only some days&nbsp; you know, when you feel really low.....  Anyhow to begin with , I just noticed that if you wanted to keep your head down(on the table),and just relax, people would think that there was something utterly wrong with you. For eg. I had suddenly developed a cold over the weekend (Another of my observations -&nbsp;&nbsp;virus invasions are usually sudden- be it the computer or the human body) and was trying to catch up on some sleep when&nbsp;I was flooded with questions such as "Whats&nbsp;the matter", "Why are you so melancholy" (by Palsy) etc. Thus my whole break was ruined in convincing these guys that I was just plain sleepy.  &nbsp;  Anyhow I decided to extend my sleep to the Physics period. As usual it was very boring and Mrs. Shobha Mehta was trying to teach us some God knows what effects , and dictating some notes. So there I was trying to do both things simultaneously. I mean its hardly possible but Soumya nudged me everytime i fell asleep. So this way i could do both things.  &nbsp;  Anyhow the joke of the day was , when I was yelling in the break (trying to convince my friends ) Adi commented- "Manisha, do you have vocal chords or is it the distortion of an electric guitar".  Everybody just burst out laughing. It&nbsp;was really hilarious at that time.  Anyhow if you havent got the joke , just leave it. Its kind of silly afterwards.  &nbsp;  Lastly , I would like to say all the best to Bhav and his team who are organising the debate for class XII (what with debaters such as Vijeta, Roaming saint,...)  &nbsp;  Till then,  &nbsp;  Hail Achilles !!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       People all around me are so sure of what they are going to do , their future plans.And though I know that I want to get into IIT , this year's performance has really disheartened me.I mean except the Toppers who came from our school, the other students have got ranks in the late thousands.So its becoming more and more difficult for the normal guys who have to make lots of&nbsp; efforts to balance both school and IIT coaching. I think this is the reason why i had been a bit touchy for the last few days. Soumya is the one who has actually gone through&nbsp;my mood swing (as she sits with me and happens to be a great friend of mine).Anyhow, yesterday in the break there was nobody in the class (everybody had gone to increase their Maths marks, Kathuria gave the corrected papers on 16th). So I was trying to do some organic questions when Kanika (another great friend of mine) came in. Kanika made me go for a walk with her. And I think that made things more clearer to me.&nbsp; I talked to her abt the difficulties which I was facing and she made me realise that I wasn't the only one who was facing the problems.Everybody has to go through it. I mean most of us. Those who dont have to are lucky.&nbsp; But anyhow&nbsp;I have decided that I will give it my best shot and then whatever happens is my destiny and I will accept it without any regrets.  I know nobody noticed&nbsp; it (neither did I want anybody to kno) but I was really in a sullen mood and feeling very down. That's why&nbsp; in the first place I thought of writing a blog.The rains and the talk have helped in making it a lot better, actually I think it is back to normal. Also writing about it has&nbsp; helped.  So my dahling Soumya I wont stop you from laughing on jokes,&nbsp; I will laugh with you .

       Well Well .. to begin with Princi sure gets weird ideas. This time I am referring to her decision about the dress code for the appointees for Investiture Ceremony (march past).It is: a white kurta ( no embroidery and should be full sleeves with a collar), along with a Gandhi cap( God knows when Gandhiji wore a cap). She is also going to make us wear Tiranga sashes (hope I have got the spelling correct) .I do think it is a non sensible idea, I mean our uniforms are so much more smarter. But anyhow who can stop her .She is The Invincible.  &nbsp;  Anyhow Karan has been very kind to my writing that I am a tomboyish person and hitting me right throughout the day . Says he can do that if I am really that sort of person. Anyhow I will be changing that in a few days time.Could not do it today , have just returned from another tiring session of Fiitjee.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After going through what I have written I do think I use too many Anyhows . Lagta hai I have to search for a new tagline.  &nbsp;  Till then  Cherio.

       For those people who had tuned into MTV at 5:00 p.m. today, it was a royal treat. Strings, the Pakistani band was playing live in the MTV studios. They were really awesome. This is one of the few Hindi bands which is really good. They performed all their hits like Door, Sar ki ye, Dhaani, Bole Bole, Anjaane etc. The lead guitarist was really good and I think those of you who missed it, must catch the repeat. Talking about bands I think the Pakistani bands Fuzon and Strings are really good. Fuzon has a very fresh feeling to it. I really love Khamas(Mora Saiyan). Even the video  is a bit different. The way the guy sings is bru..lliant. Tere Bina is also nice. Did you  know its one of the songs of the movie Hyderabd Blues 2.  Finally have got all my papers and managed an average of 81% (Its bad but thats all I could do by studying on the last day before the exams.)

       A typical bad day. Started with our darned class assembly. And though it was short and sweet , & Vijeta's speech had the audience in splits (for totally different reasons),Princi dahling decided not to give us the icecream. I dont kno what it is with our class but we have never been getting icecreams from class VIII. After that in the last period we were given our Chem papers. Mr. Dhawan seems to have taken out all his anger on us while checking the papers. The highest till now is 52 or something. No, i am not revealing my marks. But this was a disaster. Not something with which I would like to end my day at school.  As Prateek seemed to have changed his hairstyle (he now combs his hair back), Roaming Saint has retired back to his original hairstyle which is much better.  T end this post I would like to thank Sinha for all the compliments he showered on me about our class assembly in the break (and in the process ruining it as each time I had to shoo him off from our class).  By the way our class has been shifted to E106.

       This is Inspiration.  After going through a couple of blogs i thought i'll also subscribe to one. Lets begin with wishing Apoorvi a very Happy Birthday(4/07). He took us for lunch today to Yo China.  Firstly his bro is awesome (cool attitude). Anyhow we had Agzez Bloodfist (Nisheeth Sharma for the uninitiated)with us who 's a hogger. So we ended up emptying Apoorvi's pockets. I think the most shocking thing for Sinha was that he realised that i had table manners (which I usually do not showcase as most of the times we eat at fast food joints) One person who certainly didn't have them was SS (figure it out on ur own), who managed to get noodles on her hair.) Also this was a lifetime opportunity for Apoorvi as he had SS all to himself for once.(though Sinha also wanted some attention!!) NO OFFENCES MEANT. But anyhow we ended up in Barista and I ended up playing Chess with Rahul ( a friend of Apoorv's) whom i defeated in the 15 min play, though some would beg to differ. I think this is enough for the first posting.  Guys u can write ur comments too. P.S. Am dreading tommorrow (have our class assembly and will be getting Chem papers)

       Hey everything is just fine now. I mean in the recent days I had a couple of fights, well looking back upon them they werent cat fights , but cold war with some of my very good friends. They were sorted out today.( After coming to XII, basically the problems arises, when people start going out, and then they cant give much time to their old friends, which becomes pretty disgusting.) Anyhow, things got sorted out , with enormous help from Soumya. Well, there still remains one person, with whom the problems still persist,.. Anyhow, a lovely day. I have just returned from my piano class, and finally I got my teacher to teach me Sounds of Silence, and when she played it for me, it was simply heaven. Its raining too.  Fiitjee Phase Tests are on 28-29th August , so most probably, my frequency of writing posts will slow down. Please excuse.

       The unlucky day, well perhaps you could say so. The beginning was just perfectly fine. Queen meeny miny monroe's birthday , and I was also able to finish a Physics experiment in i day. Thats really something. And it was also raining. But it was the rain which turned my lovely day sour. It so happened that today our bus was parked in that street , thats right before ppc. Anyhow, just to avoid the stupid water which was trickling from the bus's rooftop, I decided to move a bit towards the wretched ditch. And lo! and behold I fell right into the ditch. Yuck!. Yeah, I know it is pretty hilarious for all of you there, but I felt sick. I knew if I tried to climb up, I would go deeper , so I shouted for Shantanu,a class XI friend of mine. He helped me up, but by that time it was so slippery, that if he wouldnt have clung to the bus, we would have both gone down. A real terrible experience. The bad luck continued. For all of the lucky people who were sitting in their home enjoying the rain, the scene on the roads was really pathetic. I had to go to Fiitjee, and was caught in a big traffic jam. It was already 3:30, and ultimately, I got down from the car near the IIT flyover and walked to Laxman Public School where I spent another 4 hrs trying to get fluids into my head.Sad plight. No I dont mind walking, if I know I am not getting late. But when its past my class time, i get very tense. So Friday, the 13th turned out to be unlucky for me. (I know for quite a few peple it was wonderful, like Bhavya who won the first prize at Fr. Agnels. Congratulations, though they looked really funny in those sunglasses.).   I would just want to wish Monroe a very   HAPPY BIRTHDAY   from my side.  P.S. Please do not write anonymous comments, its PLAIN BUGGING.

       I dont know why I have become the target point of most of my friends (no, i am not talking about being the bonking pad for Nisheeth and others). Why I am saying this.One of my good friends , Sinha recently started blogging ( he insists on referring to me as mr.c there) and in his second entry has made out as if I am the biggest hogger aound (no considerations for Nisheeth or Bhavya). No I am not, and I like to have good food as other normal ppl do. [ Well I have not added him to my links, not coz of the above mentioned stuff, but coz he knows he has to make it a blog worth viewing before that. Sinha u kno, only u have to go through this ].  Today in the morning when I saw Nilesh with his electric guitar and amp. for the morning assembly , I got really excited , expecting some good rock/metal number. I mean its been a long time since we had those guys jamming (last time was the day before the summer hols).But I was heading for a huge disappointment. They started playing Hotel California( soft by their standards) and with Sehrag singing, ohmegod.The mikes also gave up on them. A Disaster. Anyhow, from now on Damini will be called queen meeny miny monroe ( in short qm cube) on my blog.   [By the way, I havnt taken any serious offence against u Sinha, so plz chill. I kno u love to tease me.]

       6 of us, a little late in the afternoon and Spiderman 2 , a deadly combination.Really! And when 2 out of these are big gluttons, its a bit hard on the person(s) who is/r treating us. And it is  a bit embarrasing too.  Fine, no more suspense, we ended up in PVR Vikaspuri, (dont ask me why) to see Spiderman 2. A new place( atleast for us South Delhiites) but with lots of eating joints. I will start off with the (mis)happenings which took place( with me around usually nothing right happens)- 1. While watching this very intense scene in the movie, I tried to take some popcorn for Palsy who was sitting right next to me, and unknowingly dipped my fingers into the coffee (ouch!) which he was holding( while reading this plz do not hold up ur nose coz whats going to follow is more dirty). But the best part was that he actually drank the coffee after that. Immediately after this, Sinha advised Palsy to get some injections for rabies, tetanus, etc.  2. After the movie ended ( which was quite a relief for the other ppl watching, as there were some frequent comments.), we went to McDs and there Sinha ordered an icecream. I had just helped myself to some when Palsy butted his head in between, in short resulting in some cold icecream on Palsy's hair. I will not elucidate further and let ur imaginations take u through this very weird scene. But the outcome of this has been that Palsy has vowed that he will stay some miles away from me while eating and watching any movie.  3. The thing which this point shows that we are BIG GLUTTONS ( yeah, we cant still beat Nisheeth at it, i agree). We decided to have our lateish luch at Pizza Hut ( do not think we starved till then, nachos, hotdogs, cold coffee, coke, of course we do not consider them as food but thats a diff issue). I decided to serve and lo and behold the pizza toppled over inside the pan itself) and the waiter just kept staring at us. I think he had never seen a crowd like this before.  Will not go into the finer details of this magnificent day, but by this time u must have understood what happened to the pockets of Kanika and Soumya, who took the undaunting task of treating us.  A final word, with almost everybody opening up a blog now,  I do hope there is some creativity left in each of us , to attract our few viewers.  I also sympathise with Bhavya for the Columban Quiz. For more details check out his blog.

       Hey, Congratulations!!! to Akash and his team for qualifying for the finals of the Columban Open Quiz. I really hope they win it. For the uninitiated he is the same guy who has written a quiz book, and the preface of which has been done by Siddharth Basu.(if u pay any attention to what Mrs. chona says in the assembly u wud kno.)  Ok, finally I think we are going to check out Spidey on Monday after school. These summer months are very nice. Quite a lot of birthdays resulting in good eating and seeing quite a lot of movies. Well, this is the last year, and what with only 4 months left for school to get over, its creeping in. The feeling of not getting to see most of ur friends that is. I mean we dont even know where we are going to land up finally. And the bloody irony, is that though u would love to spend these last months having a gala time with your friends, chatting with them as if there was no tomorrow, u cannot as this is also the crucial year which decides where we go after this, and how our careers shape up. So, even though u would wanna talk to somebody ,u have to cut the converstation short. Well, most of my friends feel, that I am quite rude over the phone. (coz I usually start my conversation, by saying, "Ha, Bolo"). I think they do understand...  Anyhow, I havent forgotten a certain somebody's phone number. Right.   Lookin forward to lots of fun on Monday , well its only on some rare occasions that we have Soumya and Kanika going with us to see a movie. But this is only after overcoming the barrier of the Chem Monday Test , the course for which is humongous.

       Hey this is the first time I have seen frustration leading to blogging. Incase u cannot take the cue, I really dont care.  Ok, today we had a presentation by the Drexel University . And though right now I have no plans to go abroad for Grad., I just wanted to see the prospects and well, umm miss my Physics period.Of couse ,Prospects of sitting in A.C were also pretty alluring and I am not that big a pinhead as Karan seems to think to give up on it. Anyhow coming back to the presentation,  I must say they were pretty impressive. I mean passing themselves as the best university in U.S.A. without even blinking is something. Though I agree I do not have much info on foreign colleges, but I think it does not figure in the Ivy league.   The only thing which was good in their programme was the Co-op part which talked about working in Corporate Houses of America. And though she said that they give up to 20,000$ as scholarship, I havent seen anyone getting it last year.  Though the rains graced the city for the last 2 days, it hasnt poured today, not even mild showers, so I think N section should try singing Ghanan again (though without Mrs. Aditi Sarkar's guidance).

       Hey folks, I have heard much about how I look with my specs and I do agree that "geek" completely defines it. But you know its kinda irrittating to go on hearing the same thing again and again. I have to wear it, so there is no choice.  So please stop staring at me as if I am an alien who's suddenly got two antennae.

       The statements reported below are factual, and so please try your best to believe them. ( I know it is hard to, but still...) It is official now, that Bhavya has a fan following in class 11th gals. Today, he was offered a friendship band by a group of girls who also wanted him to put their names in his blog. (I will not do so, and let Bhavya introduce them to you) This is only one of the incidents which have finally led to people believing that some gals REALLY like him.This craze has increased after he organised iquiz and iquisition.  The 12th class thinks that the 11 th batch is freaky ( think about somebody finding Bhavya cute, urrrrgh..). Quoting Damini - "It is scary and very very shameful for the 11 th batch".  So all of us would like to warn these 11thees who are falling head over heels for Bhavya, about the danger that they are posing to their very existence.  But I do think it is a lovely sight to see Bhavya embarrased about it. To get a jist about how major this craze is, visit his blog and check out comments where he has posted his and PC's pic.  Maddening, but true.
