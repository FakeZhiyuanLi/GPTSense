      This is the quickest post ever!  Not much time left on our card for internet access!  We are in Pompei but leave tomorro for Brindisi (keep your fingers crossed for us as there is A LOT of travelling to be done tomorrow.)  We've seen lots and lots but we want to write about it in more detail, so just bear with us.  When we arrive in Corfu, we'll update the site properly!  Claire and Gemma xxx

      Yesterday we walked, yes folks that's right,  walked  to the Vatican City.&nbsp; All the way across Rome wearing our trusty flip flops.&nbsp; We have made friends with an Australian teacher called Tenille who came with us on our journey and shared the aches, pains and blisters of the 8 mile journey (there and back by the way, we're not quite that hardened just yet).  The Vatican was immense, a completely aweinspiring facade as we entered St. Peter's Square and looked upon the Basilica.&nbsp; The queue was long but moved along quickly and when we got to the entrance we had to make sure that we were appropriately dressed.&nbsp; By this, women had to have their shoulders and knees covered and men had to have their shoulders and ankles covered.&nbsp;   We had a guide around the Basilica who told us numerous stories of the different Popes (including the one lady pope) and of Michelangelo, who's first sculpture is housed there (Mary cradling the dead Jesus).&nbsp; Then it was on another tour around the Vatican Museum, which was HUGE.&nbsp; (we didn't get much of a sit down for lunch either, so we were all really feeling it by this point)&nbsp; Points of interest included several very famous Greek Sculptures including th Lacoon Group and, of course, the Sistine Chapel.&nbsp; The stillness and significance of the chapel was interrupted somewhat by the guards shouting 'No camera, no video' at various tourists who dared to disobey in the house of God.  We walked back and had a good long sleep.&nbsp; Boy, were we tired.&nbsp; In the evening we went for a meal (pizza, naturally) in downtown Rome and then we to view the Colessuem by night and took some really good pictures which we hope will come out well.&nbsp; At the restaurant, Gemma proudly asked for the bill in Italian "Il Konto por vavore..." (spelling might be slightly inaccurate) but it did the job.&nbsp; She's definately going native these days.  We've been affected slightly by the pollution and Gem has developed a little cough which does tend to shake the whole bunk bed when she has a little fit in the mornings!&nbsp; I am trying to learn the italian for "Please can we have some cough mixture for a dry cough?" as this may come in handy.&nbsp; I have been bitten by the monster of all mosquitos and my arm has come up a treat.&nbsp; We don't think we need the italian for this because it's actually quite easy to mime a mossi and a bite and then show the arm.&nbsp;   Incidentally, i did find out the Italian for "My dog is lost in the lake" but have since forgotten it.&nbsp; Poor Rover, one day we'll get him sorted out....  Nicky and Carolyn - we hope you are having a fantastic time in Florida!&nbsp; Four marbles and counting....not even a single hangover, how good are we...?  &nbsp;

      Yesterday was spent in the hostel for the majority of the afternoon, playing cards with randoms and basically havin a real good laugh.&nbsp; We have new rules to 'piggy' (now renamed 'snatch piggy snatch' )&nbsp;   The evening was spent in Marconi's, an Irish bar.&nbsp; Gem and I made 'snap dragons' out of the place mats (do you remember those from school?&nbsp; where you fold a piece of paper several times to make a movable folding toy with numbers and colours written on them, then finally you pick a number to reveal a statement or a dare...?)&nbsp; Well, we made snap dragons for people in the bar, including the waitress and had a good ol' giggle when her dare was to serve the next customer pretending she had a nervous twitch.&nbsp; Oh, how we laughed...!  Today, we walked to the Colleseum and had a tour around there.&nbsp; It was the most magnificent building, totally huge and thanks to Russell Crowe and Gladiator, we didn't have to use our imaginations too much in&nbsp;order to consider how it would have looked when it was in full use.&nbsp; Then we strolled up the palantine hill and saw the Roman Forum.&nbsp; After that we went up to the Capitoline hill and saw the Ancient Roman palaces.  We were both very impressed with our guides, who were very knowledgeable and also amusing in their re-telling of historical events.&nbsp; We would both heartilly recommend it to anyone.&nbsp; It was an amazing trip.&nbsp; After this, we walked to the Pantheon, then the Trevi fountain and finally the Spanish Steps (132...we counted as we huffed and puffed our way up to the top).  Tomorrow we really hope to visit the Vatican (we couldn't today because we were not wearing the correct attire) and for tonight it's just an early night, so that we are in full form for tomorrow.&nbsp; Our feet are aching (we've walked miles in our lil' flip flops today) and truthfully, we are just ready for our beds!  Carolyn and Nicky, you'll be pleased to hear that Gem and I have earned 2 marbles apiece out of a potential 2!  &nbsp;

      We boarded our plane yesterday at 15:45 exactly.&nbsp; Gem was rather obsessed with our seating arrangments becoming unduly perturbed by the woman in front who had managed to take up a whole 3 seats...yes, says Gemma, a whole  three .&nbsp; It was very craftily done, she sat on the ailse seat and proceeded to place her belongings on the other two and scowled viciously at anyone who came within a two metre radius of her.&nbsp;   The flight was calm.&nbsp; I managed to stop the circulation to Gemma's left hand on teh take off, but once she had claimed the aforementioned hand back into her possession, we both relaxed and it took only 2 hours 20 mins or so to get here.  The hostel is located in a less than salubriuous location, right next to the train station with some rather unsightly and uncouth individuals who patrol the area, looking slightly vagrantish.&nbsp; That said, it is rather cheap and as we are literally living on a shoe string (in fact have yet to check if Gem has got one of these spare in her 'just in case' rucksack)&nbsp;  "Sadly i don't have!!" lil' G.&nbsp;  The hostel is clean and friendly.&nbsp; The rooms lack air con so we cooked last night.&nbsp; This was not helped by the fact that the American closest to the window  closed  the bloomin' thing due to the noise of the street.&nbsp; Gem nearly throttled the man on the bunk bed next to her b/c he snored A LOT.&nbsp; His bunk mate also slept in offensively small pants...We're talking all out thong here... the bastard has stolen my shoe string, lil G.&nbsp;     &nbsp; Today we were up bright and early to enjoy the rain.&nbsp; Yes folks, it rained, it rained and then it rained some more....&nbsp; Gem cleverly suggested going back for our rain coats, whereupon the vision of my splash jacket hung casually over my chair  at home  came into my mind.&nbsp; I mean, you should my size of my rucksack and i decided against putting the rain coat in.&nbsp; So, we got  wet .&nbsp;   We found a local church and paid a whole euro to light 2 candles and prayed for sun.&nbsp; We struck a good balance with the almighty when we emerged from the aforementioned place of worship to find the rain had ceased.&nbsp; Evidently, even God has a limit on how much he will give for one Euro as after an hour, the heavens opened yet again.&nbsp; And they haven't stopped since.  Hence, this is why we are writing a rather long entry....because we're bored.&nbsp; We're sat in the hostel, playing cards, playing on the internet and generally wasting time.&nbsp; We'll keep you posted.

      Well, it's Friday and I've just about (just about) finished my packing.&nbsp; I think I've been quite organised really.&nbsp; I have all my shoes in the bottom of my back pack.&nbsp; I have all my non immediate use toiletries in one wash bag (i.e., germolene and nurofen and other bathroom cabinet type things) &nbsp;and all the immediate use ones (i.e., shower gel, toothbrush) etc in a second.&nbsp; Then there's a third wash bag for the day (i.e., second toothbrush, deodorant etc etc) and a fourth....only kidding, I managed to stop at three.&nbsp;   I have an outfit for every social occasion, from meeting the Pope (yes, I do indeed intend on meeting his holiness to chew the cud on theology, the infinity of the universe and, the most burning and important of issues, is there a pizza hut in heaven and do they deliver??)&nbsp; Sorry, I digress, from meeting the Pope, to walking around Pompeii, to climbing a volcano, to lying back on the beach, to partying to the early hours.... and the list continues.&nbsp; Needless to say, when I tried to put the aforementioned backpack onto my person, I realised that only by placing the backpack on a chair and kind of 'sitting into' it could I haul the damned thing onto my back.&nbsp; After that, it became blatantly obvious that to balance whilst wearing the now offending piece of luggage, I would have to bend my body forwards to a full 45 degrees before I could strike an equilibrium between myself, the backpack and gravity.&nbsp; Righto, so walking several miles around Rome whilst wearing it should be a doddle then....???!!!   We fly tomorrow at quarter past four, courtesy of EasyJet (so garish orange seats, no inflight entertainment and no refreshments to look forward to then) to arrive in Italy GMT+1 at around about 8ish.&nbsp; From there, we are navigating our way to the hostel and on Sunday we will embark on the first of our adventures, I'm sure.   Not much else to write at this obviously early stage.&nbsp; Gem and I were thinking of going out tonight in order to pass the time but I backed out because I  still  hadn't packed (does this sound like the Claire we all know and love....?) (actually, yes) and whilst in my heart, I shall truly be dancing the night away in  Life  (class act, ahem) I know that I should really be tucked up in bed.&nbsp; Although, now that I've packed, maybe I could go out after all......   For my final thought, I should like to ponder upon the wonders of modern technology.&nbsp; I upgraded my Nokia for the all new, all singing and all dancing Nokia 66something or other, with MP3, camera, video recorder and the list goes on.&nbsp; Can I get the damned MP3 thingymybob to work?&nbsp; Can I heck.&nbsp; Despite  hours  on my lap top downloading new software, moving music files to the memory card, then to my phone, and then back again, I could not get it all to work.&nbsp; But, the fact that I have used the technological phrase of&nbsp; thingymebob demonstrates my sheer incompetence and lack of ability when it comes to all things requiring a degree in computer literacy.&nbsp; Gosh, I am getting behind the times.   Anyways, please leave a message for either myself or Gem.&nbsp; And a few messages below.   Heather:-&nbsp; So glad you're coming to Corfu.&nbsp; BRING YOUR PHONE and we'll text you when you get there to meet up for a night of fun in Kavos.&nbsp; Have a great time in London and I'll hopefully see you around the 9th onwards.   Vicky and Lee:- how awful am I to forget you were both off to the land of Oz?&nbsp; Hope you have/are having the best time.&nbsp; Email me and let me know what it's all like.

      Righto all, this is the blogspot that I told y'all that I would establish so that you would not be bombarded with emails informing you&nbsp; of our adventures across Europe this summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather now you can, at your leisure, log in, read, laugh, cry, ooh and ahh and then log out.&nbsp; Seem fair?&nbsp; I think so....   Gemma and I have got this far in our planning.&nbsp; Days 1 - 5, Rome staying at the Pop Inn Hostel and taking in several sights inc. Vatican, Sistine Chapel, Colleseum, Trevi Fountain.&nbsp; Days 6-9 move southwards to Pompeii and visit the ancient city and nip across to Capri for a day.&nbsp; Then, make our way across country to Brindisi, hop on a ferry and spend days 10 - 20 in Corfu staying at the Pink Palace [think pink.... (Nikki and Carolyn should know what this means if they recall the rather smart matching T-Shirts)]&nbsp; Then it's back to mainland for a few days staying the rustic Italian setting of....(can't remember the name, but Dad will tell me) and staying with an Italian family to enjoy a bit of true Italian life.&nbsp; Hopefully then it's southward bound again to the Island of Sicily to climb Mount Etna, then a ferry back to Rome ready to fly back on the 21st August.   So far, we have&nbsp; purchased our back packs, invested in lots of 'practical' clothing (matching think pink T-shirts were completely essential) and trailed through countless web sites and travel books in search of our accommodation.&nbsp; With only 2 more sleeps to go, we have to sort out our travellers cheques today and do some washing and then .... pack.   My aunt Tanya has lent me an Italian phrase book which covers all the usual from 'Please can you direct me to the local chemist?' to 'How do you like your eggs in the morning' (only kidding...) But I am yet to find the phrase for 'My dog is stuck on a rowing boat in the middle of the Lake' and this perturbs me as i truly think that is an essential Italian phrase and could come in useful in many social situations.   I shall endeavor to add links to our accommodation, so, should the feeling overtake you, you can have a nose.&nbsp; Furthermore, I shall try to maintain this site, with Gemma on a daily basis if possible so that you know we are safe, well and having a totally brilliant time.&nbsp; Comments are welcome, if only to wish me a happy birthday (Sat. 14th August) or just to say Hi.&nbsp;   Enjoy...xxx

      Okay, so after all the last posting, we changed our minds yet again (we are female after all) and have booked ourselves bus tickets which will see us arriving in Athens tomorrow afternoon at 6 o' clock!  How excited are we?!  We are booked in the hotel Kostas (cheers me dears - we are very grateful for the invitation) and generally just thought...when else are we gonna see the Olmypics in it's original location (ok so that stadium is slightly more modern these days!), so...away we go.  Kavos:-  Kavos - hmm...let's think, what  can  we possibly say!  Let's comment individually, shall we?!  Claire thinks:  Possibly the worst of Brits abroad...everything and everything that foreigners hate about us exists here in these few little streets in the sun.  The place is lined with bars along a 'strip' which play music 24/7 (loudly) and the touts that try to get you in their bars are, to say the least .....annoying!  (mild, very mild).  Everyone we have met comes from either Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle or Doncaster (so we are apparently rather posh - oh if only they knew) and not a single Australian in sight!   But, if you can't beat 'em....so once i got over my initial reservations, i've had a quite good time, dancing the night away, doing dares that no-one would have dreamed that I would do and generally just enjoying it!  Looking forward to Athens tho....!  Gem thinks: Its Okay!!  Quite nice to hear a British accent.  It's touting heaven and not a pink drink in sight - thank god!  We are in a room where Claire sees dead people and scares the living daylights out of me AND the door won't lock from the inside so when i got in pissed from seeing Kez and Sue to the bus i thought the flimsy dressing table stool would save us from all evil!!  Let's hope i'm right!  That's all folks...not sure where we'll go after Athens (maybe I'll take Gem to Ios - Sarah, what do you think????!!!!) but we do aim to make it to north Italy, really, we do!

      This is another really quick update as we have extremely limited time left on the internet!  Currently still in Corfu, staying at Kavos...!  Have thought about moving onto Athens for Olympics but surprisingly enough will not be able to get accomodation!  (Unless we want to pay lots of extra money!) So, planning on moving back into Italy for Venice and making our way back to Rome via Verona, Florence, Pisa etc!   Ciao,  Claire and Gemma xxx

      We have tried several times to post a blog recently but for one reason or another it hasn't quite pulled off.  So, we'll start again...we have arrived (and are now soon to leave) the wonderful palace of pink.Last Sunday (in fact a week ago today) we caught several trains which took us from the Amalfi Coast and cross country to Brnidisi, one of the major ferry ports out of Italy.  One eventful occurence on the train was watching a local be arrested for stealing the money from the lunch cart.  Took several ratehr large men quite a while to overpower him (pepper spray included) and escort him from the premises.  The Italian police are quite intimidating, and yes, they did have a gun in their pockets but no, they were not pleased to see anyone!  So we arrived at Brindisi in good time and settled down at the port with several others to wait out the delay on the ferry by playing cards and the like.  A quick mention to some wonderful people we met, i.e., Monica and David.  Two Canandians who were fantastic company and stayed for the first few nights here at the palace.  We hope that you guys enjoyed Athens!  Upon embarking the ferry, we located a good camping spot before bedding down for the night.  By a good spot, we mean NOT downwind of the great petrol fumes and somewhere reasonably quieter....  It was fantastic to sleep under the stars and we were both impressed by having such a good night's sleep in such different cirumstances.  We awoke the next day to see Corfu and the Pink Palace bus!  So-o-o...the rest needs sub headings to fit it all in... here goes.....  The Pink Palace Good, very cheap, very clean and they look after you well here.  The beach is a bit of a trek down the side of the mountain but that's the only downside really.  Also, they have put Gem and I in the rooms right at the top of the hotel, so we have an extra, extra long walk....buns of steel!  We get a breakfast and evening meal included, which again is good and wholesome and there are some interesting excursions of which we have participated!  Ouzo Every other night in the "Pink Palladium" (chronic, isn't it?!) they have an ouzo circle where some of the staff get up and do some Greek dancing and people smash plates over other people's heads.  Then, they rush around the seated audience, filling their open mouths with ouzo....it's spit, swallow or choke....the stuff is lethal.  Gemma was having a great time, she was dancing away in the circle and then having more ouzo poured down her mouth, chin, T-shirt....  But that was OK....until the next morning when I was awoken by Gemma "Chunder Wonder" Wiggle, puking away in the bathroom.  Bless, she even blocked the sink!  So we're leaving a huge tip for the cleaners as they did have a job sorting that one out for us!  Ooops!    Gemma's tip of the day:  Don't drink if it's pink!  Booze Cruise Yes, this is as drunken and debauched as it sounds...they take you out on a leeetle boat and let you drink...all day.  But that's after they give you the opportunity to jump from a 55 foot cliff and into the ocean.  Gem, sensibly opted out of this particular activity.  I, however, determined to banish my fear of heights, climbed the rock face (we are talking a proper rock face here...I said to the guy,  what happens if i slip?   To which he replied.... you don't slip  - I looked at the rocks below and clung on!)  So, I was the second person to jump.  It was a long, long way down and the shock alone nearly killed me...but wow!  what an adrenaline rush!  After that, there were drinking games, swimming in pitch black underwater caves (some not underwater with bats flying above our heads) snorkelling and more cliff jumping (but not me this time!)  It was a fun day!  We have had a great time here and we are leaving to go to Kavos tomorrow and see some friends there!  We've played about with the idea of going to Athens, if not then Venice (there's a ferry from Corfu to Venice, so probably the most likely option) and even just not catching our flight but just training it all the way back to England (that won't happen, but it kept us entertained for a little while!)  Hope all is well wherever you are,  Claire and Gemma xxx

      On Saturday (God seems like an ice age ago now) we were up nice and early to complete 2 more things off our 2 do list i.e., climb Vesuvius and visit the ruins of Pompei.  At the bus stop we met up with another teacher called Carina (seems that teachers are two a penny over here) and enjoyed (!?) a rather perilous bus journey to the volcano.  The views were fantastic but the roads rather windy, almost too windy for such a large bus to manouvere around, we thought, but we made it safe and well to the top.  The rest of the journey had to undertaken on foot.  It was quite a steep climb! After the first 100 m we were clearly wondering,  what the heck are we doing????   However, it was totally worth it.  The views of the Amalfi coast were simply fantastic and the volcano itself had an impressive crater which we were able to walk around and take lots of pictures of.  We all managed to grab some genuine Vesuvian rock as well which, sorry guys, is my present to you all!  That's all I'm bringing back!  If it hasn't turned to Vesuvian dust in my back pack by the time I get home.  In afternoon we walked around the ruins of ancient Pompei.  It was hot and we were tired so  we didn't quite see as much as we wanted.  It was beautifully preserved but unfortunately we totally missed the house of the fugitives (all the dead people) which was something we both wanted to see.  Ah well....  That evening we met with Tennille (from Rome) and Carina and went for nice, civilised meal!  Then, an early night as we all had big trips to make the next day.  Comment about Pompei:  We thought Rome was pretty rough in places, but Pompei....well, it truly is full of  perverts !  We were casually walking along Via Plino when some random pulls up in his car and Gem thinks he's about to ask for directions.   Bless her  - she was quite worried about how she might answer his questions because obviously, our Italian ain't that good.  To her surprise, Gem is presented with a rather different question of 'You like...?' and, yes, the man had exposed himself!  Oh nice.......  Thankfully, we had the presence of mind to simply laugh at him and then walk off.  He was undeterred however, as he drove past several more times!  (I'm sorry Emma, i was too shocked to use a phrase from the book you gave me!!!)   When we swapped this story with other travellers, it turned out that the same man had been doing the same to them too!  So be warned, grey punto, dodgy dark haired Italian....avoid at all costs!

      There are many names which we could have used to entitle this blog:  i.e., 10 places not to eat pizza, 10 most likely places to find a flasher in Italy or Spot the Brit abroad (look to the nearest queue).  But we don't have this luxury because....goodness me, we have A LOT to catch up on for this site...so let's get cracking.  Might take a couple of blogs to do all this justice and we might shoot off soon because our tummies our empty and our the alcohol levels in our system might possibly be lowered to something resembling 'normal' and that needs to be rectified ASAP.  On Thursday we bade farewell to Rome (the pickpockets, the weird one-armed drunk and the spitters at the station - oh it was a lovely area we stayed in) and travelled to Naples via Eurostar.  A nice, clean air conditioned journey.  Then we moved further south to Pompei.  We stayed in the Hostel Pellegrini which was clean, hospitable and quiet.  It was also closed every day between 10 - 3 which was not useful when we arrived, sweltering under the heat and laden under the weight of our backpacks at 1.30.  But all was not lost as the local restaurant owner let us bput our bags there for a while whilst we explored modern Pompei and got our bearings.  Once checked in, we headed for the train station and took the Circumvesuviana line to Ercolona and saw the preserved city of Heculaneum, which had suffered the same fate as ancient Pompei.  We both liked the ruins which were very intact, all things considered.  But the place lost some points for having no tour, and no literature available to help us work out exactly what we were looking at.  Our Italian improved rapidly through the day.  We can now ask quite useful things, such as  which platform does the train for Pompei leave from?   and  Is this the train for Pompei?   which is a step up from saying  ciao marinero  (hello sailor! - to be said with a flick of the leg and a big wink) to all and sundry (hey - it kept us amused...and still does)  We have found the Italian people to be very friendly and helpful, even offering help when we didn't think we needed it (but actually did!).  The next day we took a day trip to the island of Capri.  Again, our newly improved Italian was very useful.  I managed to get our laundry sorted and Gemma was using her vocabulary in the bank.  We have however, come across one issue with the language - it's fine to ask for something, but then we don't understand the answer!!!  Oh well....  Capri was a pleasant day.  The majority of it was spent on a boat trip around the island, taking in some sights and culminating in a trip into the  Castro Azzuro  (blue caves).  This entailed disembarking from our, safe and sturdy boat on to a teeny tiny row boat in the middle of some quite tumultuous waters...being charged for the row boat, being charged for entry into the caves and then being told we had to tip.  Rip off!  But the caves were lovely, the sun caught the water in such a way that a wonderful blue light radiated around us and it really was worth the effort and the cash.   We then discovered that there are certain places where it is not a good idea to eat pizza.  The first of these was standing at the marina, with people jostling for position on the jetty at peak time, waiting for the hydrafoil back to the mainland.  I (by total accident) had managed to order a whole take out pizza, it was HUGE.  So Gem and I felt obliged to eat it...and we did well....not one single spillage and not a mouthful wasted.  But, it was quite a job.  Not queuing here....on the continent you push and pull people out of your way.  With a large pizza in tow....it's really not that easy....!
