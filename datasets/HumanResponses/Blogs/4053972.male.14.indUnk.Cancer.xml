       Hey guys, doing my daily blog update. Today wasn't shitty for once. My mother actually let me go out and do something with my friends! She's being nice, and it's probably to sucker me into living with her, because she knows I want to live with my dad. And because he pays child support, that's 125$ a week that she loses. Oh well, anyway, I went bowling with Jon, Marylynn, and her friend Keri. That was fun, and then after that me and Jon walked to Victorian park to play a game of my beloved Mini-Golf. Yeah Jon, pink > purple anyday. Then Jon's mother gave me a ride home, which was cool I guess considering it's only half a mile away. Then I came home to my sister's birthday "party"....Cake and swimming in the pool is enough for her I guess. Oh yeah, and i'm  STILL  getting my birthday gifts/cards in the mail from all of my relatives. My birthday was June 25th, almost a month ago. Shows how much they care, but oh well they are family, so i'll let this one slip. Well, this brings me to where I am right now, sitting at the computer writing this blog. I have nothing else to say except comment on my blog if you read it please! That would be great.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Y   Marylynn

       Hey guys, another boring....er I mean great day today! Yeah I woke up today, got on the computer and basically haven't moved since. Yes I know it's sick, but I didn't really get the oppurtunity to do anything anyway. Oh well. Football starts next monday, that's going to be wicked cool. Hopefully I get the position I want and all....    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't think of anything else to write, so that's all for now.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Y      Marylynn       &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Hi guys, I haven't updated in awhile, so I figured i'd do it now. Oh man, I love photoshop! As soon as I got it (like 2 days ago) I haven't stoped playing with it, except when I have to go somewhere or do something. I want to get good in Bryce/3D studio max (I'm going to try them both and whichever I like more i'll use), then once I do that i'll be able to render awesome 3D images and then touch them up with photoshop. Oh man, I can't wait. Other than that, my life has been going pretty good. Football is great right now, and i'm one of the biggest/fastest/strongest kids there haha. Makes me feel special. Well, nothing else has happend so I think i'm gonna go now, and i'll update later! Comment and make it positive!  "Vampires Lament" - Atreyu    Y

       Hey people, once again updating my blogger. This weekend I went over my dad's house, which was pretty cool. Friday night I had practice, and after that we went to applebee's(After an uber-fast shower, of course). Then my sister complained that she was "tired" in the restaurant, so we ordered food and then went home to eat. Then I went to bed, and woke up to the great day of saturday! Oh boy! Well, we met up with my uncle, went to breakfast, and then went to some generic sports store in derry to get some of my football equipment. Then it was off to my grandfather's house, to fix the foundation under his house because it's rotting out. We were there until about 6:30, and then we left to get a pizza and settle down at home for the night. We watched "Starsky and Hutch" which was an alright movie. Then today I went to church, then went to the mall to get  more  football stuff that I didn't get the day before. I saw Nick, Steph, and Jess at the mall, which was cool. After that we went to my grandfather's house  again,  to help him load something into his truck. After that (wow alot of "after that's and then's) we got dropped off at home, and here I am now! Ooh tomorrow we get to wear pads to practice.... I'm feeling evil. Oh well, that's enough for now, i'll post tomorrow. Comment and make it positive!

       G'day mates, oww! Today in football practice we were hitting pads that people were holding, and Nick was holding one. And everytime i'd go to hit that pad, he'd slam it into my head, which in turn caused my neck to crack and then hurt. And now it is INCREDIBLY sore, which sucks. But other than that, practice was sweet. Before that, I basically did nothing. I haven't gotten my SHS schedule yet, i'll just go to the school and request it. Today wasn't anything special so I have nothing else to say. I will update tomorrow! Comment please, and make it positive!  "All downhill from here" - New Found Glory     Y

       H'lo ladies and gent's, here's another wonderful update to my awesome blog! Yeah I am so sore from football, today was my second practice. (The second practice is  ALWAYS  the hardest, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been though. Before that though, I just hung out all day at home, 'twas nothing special. Oh yeah, I got tuna-fish  IN MY BELLYBUTTON  today! That was interesting. Well, I opened the can, and I was squeezing the lid into it so all of the "juices" (eww) would come out, and the lid bent and tuna sprayed everywhere! It was all over me and I had no shirt on so it got all over my body. Yeah that sucked, but I bet it would've been funny if you were there. Well I have nothing else to say, and I'll update tomorrow!    "Vindicated" - Dashboard Confessional      Y

       Wow guys, so it's gonna be short. Today I had football practice for two hours, I felt like I was gonna throw up halfway through, but after that it was all good. Then when I got home I was HYPER, but know i'm gonna pass out of tiredness. Oh yeah i got a new picture of me if any of my friends want it i'll send it to you. Alright that's it for now, i'll type tomorrow/later today!                                                                 Y

       Hey guys, updating my blog once again...I'm so bored! Oh well, I suppose I shouldn't complain, I mean it's not like i'm making the effort to go out and do anything. Football starts tomorrow! Woot I can't wait, I've been thinking about it and it's finally here! It's like christmas for me. But yeah, all you guys will definitely have to come to my games. I will post the game times and places etc. Other than that, I don't really have much to say. My hair started to curl FINALLY, i've been waiting for that for a while now. Oh yeah, and I decided to post a song with every blog entry that I make, and if you want download it. Comment if you do please, that would be cool.
