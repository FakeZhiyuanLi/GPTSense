       got a call from office, asking me to help out in holland village's branch today.. so was kinda tired but still went ahead.. the day was messy in hv but overall it was okay. Anyway, im getting too used to working now. so i gradually think of phei qi when im at it.. which isnt gd cause i kinda joined h.d. to divert my attention... to everyone who wants to know what's going on, there has been no news of phei qi since i came back from japan. However, mostly when i think of it.. im still optimistic abt this whole thing, even though there hasnt been a single msg, call or whatever between us. I've nv felt so strongly b4, there maybe other's out there. but none are like phei qi, recently it seems that my relations with girls really sux. oh well.. if life is run by fate, which i doubt, then i'll have to accept it.

       Yea, kinda delayed a month to make this entry.. anyway, i've been kinda bz so i didnt have time to do anything abt this blog. as you all can see. My first few weeks at ngee ann were full of drama, so many new faces.. much to get used to and... nice sandwiches there =D anyway, my class is kinda great, though i have much catching up to do since i've no add maths or bio background... hmmmm..... what to do~~ study harder lor.  oh ya, maybe i'll describe some of my new classmates. Firstly, Jie ying, one of the first few ppl i approached in class, maybe cause she looked mightly familiar, n she came to be from my pri sch too.. no wonder, quite a nice girl. can get sarcastic n etc, n helpful in studies. Michael, some weird guy who keeps singing the 2nd storey window song, (The window, the window, the 2nd storey window!!) argh, a whack on your head for that man.. Next, Mick. the guy with the Out Of Bed look. tend to pick on jeremy's height and very sarcastic.. but all that is meant to be a joke right? Lol. N Jeremy, a gd pal too. someone with no bio background. Yea man, same as me. at least he handles all those jokes very well. gd luck with.. ahemm... Kelvin, a fellow computer pal. with him, we're able to converse on various comp games. great way to pass time. Alvin, one character who at first didnt talk much. but thankfully, the guys(WE ALL ROCK) got united n so and on. Sharman, the only other person who has the exact same timetable as me. cause we are also in the same IAC n O Com class, those classes are a waste of time man... argh.. Next, Tiffy. Very socialable but scary with those contacts.. faster get your originals back!! vampire eyes.. erm... Sheena Chee, equally socialable. one of the oldest in our lot. ahha live so far away. The other sheena, or Hui yun. she tends to scare me, her maths, chem n bio so pro... scary.. but she is a funny person. Jessie, one mad girl. reminds me of pei ying. those sporty types. anyway, she is a les(jk), ahhahaha. always with those damn nicks. and wei yu, not very familarise with you. all i know is that you n serene are jie ying's friends. as for *rain* n siti, thanks for helping me out in the first n 2nd ipc practicals. sry abt joan, chloe, serene, still not very close to you 3 yet.. soo... that sums up the day.. back to maths revision.. must practice alot sia..
