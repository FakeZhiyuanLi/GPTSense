      Its been awhile since I logged on. I had another dream this afternoon about my teeth falling out. It seems so real that when I wake up I touch my teeth. But its never the front teeth its always the back or molars. I keep reading dream intrepretation websites and they all have different meaning, so I dunno whats going on.   So I cut my hair on Friday. I had been growing it out and for some reason, I went in to chop it all off, about 6 inches to be exact. Yep. It just brushes my shoulders. Plus Its DARK brown and Black. and i wanted some blonde in there so i got panels but the chicks at visible (my cousin is a senior stylist there) convinced me to put a temporary hair color on the blonde. Orange! You know that prescription bottle orange, yeah that one. But you can only see the tips coming out from the bottom, but you must put some sunglasses on if michaelle pretends to flip her hair, which i tend to do. It was ok for the first 2 hours, but I am not diggin it. All I can think of is Halloween!! So I already made an appointment for tomorrow so they can strip off the orange. I hope that my hair dosent fall out! Ahhh!   Well the Texas Lotto was 70 million tonight, and I guess I totally missed the drawings on the news, I bought 5 tickets, but the lotto is all fucked up now, I felt like a dumb ass when I went to buy the tickets cuz they have bonus balls and quick pick 5 or 1 and all this crap. Damn, why does it have to be all difficult to win 70 mil? lol. Anyway, So I'm off to the website to see if some of my daydreams can come true!

      Yeah so I'm reading over all these blogs and guess what I read, it was just too hilarious not to share. You know how it goes, you go out on the weekend intake too much "drank" and the next day your "hung-over". But what about your throbbing feet? Now thats a "heel-over".  LOL, i know it might be stupid but it made me laugh.

      We've all seen it... Doogie Howser. And we all thought, I'm going to write a daily journal on my PC like that! But here I am 22 and never did it. Till today that is. Hopefully I can keep this blog up. Will I share? I dunno yet. There so much yet so little going on right now. Anxious to see how this page starts to look when it goes live, so i'll add in more later.

      So I was thinking... in the shower nonetheless. LOL I know how to scam the post office. Thats right.  And after I try it... i'll let ya'll know how it went. That or I'll call you for bail money from the federal detention center. heh! Well you know when you don't put enough postage on your envelope or what not. Well they send it back to sender right? Well what if you purposely wrote the sender's address as the address where you want it to go! They' send it back! Which would really send it to where you wanted it to go in the first place. I'm a fucking genious!!!

      Wow, it had been a long time since I posted. So what exactly did I do this month? My off month from school? Well at the begining I went up to North Carolina to see Nadia graduate. Yes it was nice getting away from the smog for a while. And IF I COULD post pictures I would, but I guess I'll have to email them out (yea u christin, the only one that reads this) because stupid blogspot stopped selling their upgraded version - is that stupid or what? they dont want money? whatever... well see if they get their heads out there ass soon, or else i'll have to move.   ok yea so i was in north carolina. i left nadias house really wanting a pet. kalua and lady ... aww they're like kids i swear. i came back for a week, then i went off to guanajuato for a 4 day weekend, but i really didnt party or anything down there. my dad set up a little conv. store by the house he built and so i went and set up the cash register, programmed it and taught the people that are working the store how to use it. becuase they were totally running it like it was the 17th century all by hand. plus they were jacking us. this store better pull in some good cash cuz thats what im planning will subsidize my 'rents retirement. i dont want to be getting "send some money" calls when im older. lol.   ok christin- i wanna tell you something. DONT get discouraged by the entire school situation. because you'll never believe what.... i finally got my gpa high enough to get into Bauer. and if i can do it, i know you can. it was sooo incredibly low at one point. And you better hurry up too because i've heard they're thinking about bumping it up to 3.00   it was awful though- i went in to talk to the advisor and he was like yeah well you got denied last semester but with spring semester grades i think youll be over the requirement. I got 3 a's and a c last semester. (but two of those were spanish and one was public speaking) i aint all that proud. so i walked out of there all happy that i was pretty much in, i just had to post the application online. and when i did, i got the ugliest email saying i wasnt in - because i didnt meet the requirements. i was a total mess. i couldnt sleep or anything. then i got mad because the guy had all but assured me i was in. next day i get this email saying oops we messed up you in. what!!! that could have totally changed everything had i not questioned it! i would have gone to UH downtown, because i had run out of classes. agghhh, i get all worked up talking about it again. ok this is long. be back in a couple... really ;)

      I'm having a fat day. So I go to buy some jeans, try them on and they fit great. not perfect, i've never had a perfit fit jean. well they had this little snag on them, so i go back to the rack where they are folded and get another pair. same size, cut etc.  yeah so now i come home and they suck! the waist is waaay high, and i have no waist so this is a problem. and they're petite. wtf! aaghh, i should just quit and wear umpa-lumpa style clothes. oh and i cant return them no more, i took all the tags off. so ill see if they shrink in the wash a little (yeah like its possible to shrink up-down and not side-to-side) lol
