       Today was a bit dull really, I took Theo to the shops and for a walk around the market. I made gammon with roast potatoes and garlicky peas for my Mum and Step dad.       The weather has been changeable, scorching sun to hailstones all in the space of a couple of hours.      I got an email from Dennis saying I was a great friend, which was nice of him.      Also had a few emails from my friend Rose in Newcastle, she's moving into her new house next week and is buying loads of new things.      Well, that really is a waste of space and I truly apologies to anyone bothering to read it, what can I say? Everyone goes through boring phases in their life and I'm smack in the middle of one!

       This morning (after letting the plumber in - we're having some building work done.) I took Theo into work to show him off to my colleagues. He was really good during the bus journey, but when we got to work they were testing the fire alarm and it really unsettled him, so he was a bit weepy after that. I got my return to work date sorted - 21/02/2005. Clive was there, beaming at me like a rather stupid child. He was wearing a Starsky and Hutch T-shirt which was far too tight for him, and he had shaved off his beard which didn't improve his appearance. Why WHY why did I ever fancy him??? I think the best way for me to live is to be single, as my choices in men are absolutely terrible. ~If I wasn't anti-religion I'd consider becoming a nun.   On my way back home I went into Waterstones and bought a true crime book "If loving you is wrong" by Gregg Olsen which is about Mary Kay Letourneau who is an American teacher who had an affair with an underage student and had 2 children by him.   The weather was hot and sunny all day - despite the weather reports saying it would rain.

       Ok, this is a little strange. I have never managed to keep a diary for more than 2 weeks, so we shall see how long I keep this up!    I've always thought it odd that people write diaries to keep them secret - why write something down if you don't want anyone else to read it? So an online diary seems to be a good idea.      The weather (if you are interested in that kind of thing) was really nice this morning and has rained all afternoon.      I'm going to start at the beginning and explain a bit about myself - if you find this boring please feel free to skip parts!      I was born on August 5th 1980 to a Mum and Dad who loved me very much. I was spoilt rotten!   When I was two my paternal Grandma died and my Dad discovered that his Mum and Dad (who died in 1957) had never been married. They had had a wartime romance and his Dad had left his wife to be with my Grandma. My Dad also discovered that he had two older half sisters who he knew nothing about. I have still not managed to trace them.      When I was six my status as the all important youngest in the family and first grandchild was shattered by the arrival of my younger cousin Tabitha, who is now a stunning, fashionable, intelligent 18 year old who is going to start at University in Manchester in September.      When I was ten my beloved Dad died.      When I was 13 we moved from the house I was brought up in to a new house to live with my Mums fiance.      When I was 14 my Mum remarried. Depressingly she's still married to him.      When I was 16 I got engaged to a fella I'd met at college. Justin was kind, gentle a computer whiz and had a huge family. I spent a lot of time with his family, especially with his brother Dennis, who I had very strong feelings for (which I never acted upon). I'm still in touch with his Mum, Sister and Dennis.      When I was 17 my adored maternal Grandad died.      When I was 18 Justin and I split up, he went off to University and I got a job, I was also diagnosed with diabetes.      I was 20 when I met Burt. He saved me from being chatted up by a drunk in the bus station on my way home. I moved in with him and his Mum (BIG mistake, she was a filthy woman who smoked 50 a day, the house stank and she let the dog pee and crap in the kitchen because she couldn't be bothered to open the back door, she also expected Burt to pay all the household bills while her money was spent on fags, chocolate and getting a taxi to work whenever she was late (most days) however I will give her one good point - she wasn't a heavy drinker!) I got engaged to Burt.      I was 22 and Burt and I had got a mortgage and found the home of our dreams when for no real reason Burt decided to resign from his job. I couldn't have afforded to pay a mortgage on my own, and I couldn't trust Burt, so the house fell through and we split up. Three weeks later he was living with his Dad in Wales and was madly in love with a 17 year old called Phyllis.       I asked out a fella I worked with, Clive, he had been really good to me during the whole Burt episode. He told me he loved me, but he lied. On the anniversary of my Dads death he wouldn't come round and I spent the day alone and feeling suicidal. After we split up I realized he had never once complimented me without being nudged into it. Despite that I was in love with him and I was heart broken when we split.       In my heartbreak I decided to believe the saying that the only way to get over someone is to get under someone else (Don't believe it!! It's a lie!!) and horror of horrors I joined a dating agency. It matched me up with a bloke who shall from now be known as Arrogant Fuckwit.    He seemed to be a genuinely nice bloke. I'm obviously easily taken in. He demanded sex when I wasn't ready, I can only put it down to my bruised pride that I gave in and slept with him. We split up when I told him (after eight weeks) that I wasn't interested in marrying him and that I wanted to get back with my ex, Clive.    Six weeks later in April last year I discovered I was pregnant. I wrote to the Arrogant Fuckwit who sent me a reply telling me that he was shocked, and very little else.    I had tried for a baby with Burt but nothing ever happened, I assumed I wasn't particularly fertile. A "normal" pregnancy has a one in five chance of miscarriage. I am diabetic and I have a four times higher chance of miscarriage. My Mum had lost 3 babies before falling pregnant with me, so I never believed that I would actually bring a baby home. I considered abortion, but I didn't have the guts to go through with it - suppose this was my only chance to have a baby? At 33 weeks I got pre-eclampsia and was taken into hospital, I was induced and Baby Theo was born seven weeks early weighing 7lb (very heavy for a premature baby!) He was completely fine, I was quite ill and in hospital for 3 weeks altogether (I'm fine now!) and now I have a 9 month old baby boy who is quite simply fantastic!    When Theo was born I rang the Arrogant Fuckwit who answered the phone then told me that he was out - clearly not expecting me to recognize his voice. Half an hour later his Mum rang me to tell me that he didn't want to have a relationship with him (??? I was telling him that the baby was born out of courtesy, I think it's fairly important to know if you have a kid or not.) I asked if he wanted to see the baby, she said no and I said fine, I'm won't be getting in touch again and hung up. I can't believe that a mother would shield her son from admitting responsibility for his own child, but there you go - there are some bad mothers about. I can only try to be a better mother than her.       Well, I think that is more than enough for a first diary entry. Hopefully the next ones will be a bit less demanding...
