      I'm gonna wake up and make coffee Step into a cold shower Tell my mom sorry That I didn't mop the floor Maybe  I'm gonna get changed and get out from the house Take a bus to everywhere I wanna go Allow my senses to be aroused Allow my mind to go with nature's flow Maybe  I'm gonna watch a movie alone With popcorn and some coke I'm gonna turn off my phone Make sure that no one calls Maybe  After the show I'll walk to his place Wondering if he might look out The sky's face is staring down at me As I walk home empty handed Maybe  I'll go online every night Hoping we could talk To me it feels neither wrong nor right But i know i'll still continue to walk Maybe  I hop into bed with thoughts in my head Sometimes the thoughts were blank And my conscience didn't say If I should continue life this way Maybe  Or I could say 'I love you." Make coffee and mop the floor I do the housework mom tells me to do And I'll remember to lock the front door  Or I could fold a heart for you Sit with you side but side Look out from the bus window and wonder if i had anything to hide  Or i could watch another movie with my best friend And laugh because we're bimbos We could never find any more movies to rent If we had already watched all the shows  Or I can cry and look back being a rotten girl And tell you sorry over the phone Sorry I failed you and make you upset Sorry I had to make you feel so alone  Maybe if could control my mind Things weren't be so bad Maybe if i was a little sensible back then I would'nt keep on feeling sad  Maybe if you didn't meet me Things weren't be so bad Maybe if didn't talk to each other i wouldn't keep on feeling sad  But to think again,maybe if we didn't know each other I'll never learn to love or to miss someone  I couldn't get any further If I didn't think that you were the one     Written by Drifting Heart    *Me and my guitar are one* *Me and my guitar are one in eternity*

      To a special someone...  Something 'bout the way you looked at me. Made me think for a moment. That maybe we were meant to be. Living our lives seperately. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately.  Oh, why can't I ignore it? I keep giving in, but I should know better. 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked at me. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately.  You looked my way and said "you frustrate me." Like you're thinking of lines and times. When you and I were you and me. We took our chance out on the street. Then I missed my chance. And chances are it won't be coming back to me.  Why can't I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better. 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked at me. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately. So desperately.  Why can't I ignore it? I keep giving in but I should know better. 'Cause there was something 'bout the way you looked me. And it's strange that things change. But not me wanting you. So desperately.  I want you so desperately. I keep giving in but I should know better. I keep giving in but I should know better. So desperately. I want you so desperately.   Desperately by Michelle Branch

      Dedicated for my past...   Maybe I'd do better on my own No one ever seems to understand me It's easier for me to be alone There's still a piece of me that feels so empty  I've been all over the world I've seen a million different places Back through the crowds and all the faces I'm still out there looking for you  Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never knowing at all What is the chance of finding you out there? Do I have to wait forever?  I write about the things I'll never know I can find a moment just to a slow down It makes me think I'll never have the chance To figure out… what it's all about So tell me… what it's all about… 'cause  Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never knowing at all What is the chance of finding you out there? Do I have to wait forever? Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never ever knowing at all And I still don't know  Where are you now? I'm trying to get by with never ever knowing at all What is the chance? Of finding you out there  Do I have to wait, do I have to wait, do I have to wait forever?     Where are You now? by Michelle Branch

      Listen, heart Listen close-listen 2 the melancholy Melody of your own voice I am weary of my own dreaming I am tired of waiting So this time, I'm leaping  I reach-beyond myself 2 see What I find, beyond my mind, there is no time In this place beyond my sight My heart knows what is not yet seen I'm witnessing my own becoming  Lash myself 2 the Mantle of my desire-I will Turn from its temptations But the wanting takes me higher  I am hurting Oh, I am not yet born I am the mother and the father Of what is not yet known  Darkness surrounds me I scratch,  I struggle,  I breathe  And I'm reachong-beyond myself 2 see What I find, beyond my mind, there is no time In this place beyond my sight My heart knows what is not yet seen I'm witnessing  I reach-beyond myself 2 see What I find, beyond my mind, there is no time In this place beyond my sight My heart knows what is not yet seen I'm witnessing my own becoming   Becoming by Jewel

      I know that you lied to me Using just your words to shatter me Your words are like a dream But dreams could never fool me It's not right to me  I'm acting so distant now Turned my back as you walked away But I was listening That you fight your battles far from me It's not right to me  "Don't you worry 'cause I come back" I could hear you speaking as You walked to battle I acted strong To hide the pain when I Turned back the pages Crying out a windy answer What if I shed my tears and Begged you not to leave?  But now I'm not afraid to do What's in my heart  Those thousand words Have never been spoken So far away I'm sending them to you wherever you are Suspended on shiny wings Those thousand words Have never been spoken They'll treasure you Make you no longer dare seem So far away And hold you forever  That dream isn't over yet I pretend and say, "I can't forget" I still live in my day You've been there with me all the way It's not right of me  "Don't you worry 'cause I'll write to you" I could see you speaking as You looked away I acted strong To hide the love when I Turned back the pages Anger might've been the answer But if I shook my head and said That I can't wait  But now I'm not afraid to do What's in my heart  Those thousand words Have never been spoken So far away I'm sending them to you wherever you are Suspended on shiny wings Those thousands words Have never been spoken They'll treasure you Make you no longer dare seem So far away And hold you forever  Those thousand words Have never been spoken La la la la I'm sending them to you wherever you are Suspended on shiny wings Those thousands words Have never been spoken La la la la Make you no longer here Feel like calling me La la la...

      A pair of old folk of eighty years sitting side by side Not a word between both of them, each had words to hide Sat in silence as the hours wasted themselves away Not a murmur between them in each passing day  A pair of love birds sitting in a park bench Each feeling that their own heart had been wrenched Words and emotions in their eyes, hidden at bay Not a murmur between them in each passing day  A married couple with children and a life In the brink of divorce, yet none of them cried The children were innocent, ignorant with play Not a murmur between them in each passing day  A wistful girl looked from afar For the boy she loved knew not was in her heart She had her heart brimming full of words to say But not a murmur between them in each passing day  The old man left earlier than his wife She finally broke the silence on the day he was about to die He said "Love, I love you, i regret the moments uncaught," "Too many times wasted, we lost the dusk and dawn."  A hand cradled in his face she looked him in the eye She finally broke silence on the day she was about to die "I'm sorry to say, that I can't stay with you anymore," "I'm sorry the times with you i missed the dusk and dawn"  Tears from a family wept pools around him She felt as if her heart was about to sink "Honey don't cry, I loved you the day i married you," "I'll just be going home to God, one day you'll join me too."  She thought of her unrequited love How he's going to leave for the heavens above "How I wished you knew that I've been loving you all the time," "I'll keep on loving you till God cuts my line."  How it seems to funny when we break the silence when we lose someone We never know how much we loved and were loved till be break the run Too many words unspoken yet we let time slip away Don't be unspoken or you'll wondering at the place you'll lay      Written by Drifting Heart

      Turn to me with frozen lips Your hands are icy cold Your eyes burn bright against the frost-bit sky You never seemed more lovely than you do tonight Pale on the horizon Like leaves frozen in the snow Our two shadows merge inseparably Will time stand still if it's pierced with cold The more I live The more I know What's simple is true I love you   There's a warmth in my heart It haunts me when you're gone Mend me to your side and never let go Say time knows nothing, we'll never grow cold The more I live The more I know What's simple is true I love you   Twilight descends on our silhouette How soon spring comes How soon spring forgets I wanna hold time, say it'll never begin Old man winter be our friend Old man winter be our friend   'Cause the more I live The more i know what's simple is true   What's simple is true I love, I love you    What's Simple is True by Jewel

      Opherus and Edurydice Loved till after life Loved past death And no one criticized  Yes, thie love was a newborn In this newfound privilge Written in poems, sung in songs At that times this is what love is made  But now love has turned into flames of fury from cases of jealousy and spite That was the love once old, thought lovely The love now we cry and fight  But some of us still have the old love The small love as a keepsake To treasure it, the old tradition of love This is what love is made  Makes you wait, though you lost faith You feel stupid as why the wait Move on, learn to forget But you still continue loving though you can't turn back  We forgot our purpose of life on Earth The benefit that gods don't experience above The joy, the hate, the ability to touch emotions And of course, the power of love  Times have changed and people lived to survive To live a life uncommon Money, competition and a career all to fight We tend to forget what we relaly have to know  And at the end of our lives God ask us "What have you learnt on Earth all this while?" We can't pour out our equations, formulas and proposals Cause it's the lessons of life we have not yet found      Written by Drifitg Heart   *Me and my guitar are one* *Me and my guitar are one in eternity*

      I hope you never lose your sense of wonder You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger May you never take one single breath for granted God forbid love ever leave you empty handed  Chorus: I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance, I hope you dance  I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance Never settle for the path of least resistance Living might mean taking chances, but they're worth taking Loving might be a mistake but it's worth making Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter When you come close to selling out, reconsider Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance  And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance (time is a wheel in constant motion always) I hope you dance (rolling us along) I hope you dance (tell me who wants to look back on their youth and wonder) I hope you dance (where those years have gone)  I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens. Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance. And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.  And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance I hope you dance (time is a wheel in constant motion always) I hope you dance (rolling us along) I hope you dance (tell me who wants to look back on their youth and wonder) I hope you dance (where those years have gone)    I Hope you Dance by Lee Ann Wommack

      I hear the clock, it's six a.m.  I feel so far from where I've been  Got my eggs and my pancakes too  Got my maple syrup, everything but you  Break the yolks, make a smiley face  I kinda like it in my brand new place  I wipe the spots off of the mirror  Don't leave the keys in the door  Never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause   Dreams last so long  Even after you're gone  I know you love me  And soon you will see  You were meant for me  And I was meant for you   Called my momma, she was out for a walk  Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk  Picked up a paper, it was more bad news  More hearts being broken or people being used   Put on my coat in the pouring rain  Saw a movie it just wasn't the same  'Cause it was happy and I was sad  It made me miss you oh so bad  Dreams last so long  Even after you're gone  I know you love me  And soon you will see  You were meant for me  And I was meant for you   Go about my business, I'm doing fine  Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line  Same old story, not much to say  Hearts are broken every day  Brush my teeth and put the cap back on I know you hate it when I leave the light on I pick a book up  Turn the sheets down  Take a deep breath and a good look around  Put on my pj's and hop into bed  I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead I try and tell myself it'll be all right  I just shouldn't think anymore tonight   Dreams last so long  Even after you're gone  I know you love me  And soon you will see  You were meant for me  And I was meant for you    You were Mean for me by Jewel

      Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch Watching the clouds roll by  They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago  When she used color carelessly, painted his portrait  A thousand times--or maybe just his smile--  And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go  'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves  A lovely world   Oil-streaked daisies covered the living room wall  He put water-colored roses in her hair  He said, "Love, I love you, I want to give you mountains, the sunshine  The sunset too  I want to give you everything as beautiful as you are to me."   'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves  A lovely world   So they sat down and made a drawing of their love, an art to live by  They painted every passion, every home, created every beautiful child  In the winter they were weavers of warmth  In summer they were carpenters of love  They thought blue prints were too sad so they made them yellow   'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves  A lovely world   Until one day the rain fell as thick as black oil  And in her heart she knew something was wrong  She went running through the orchard screaming,  "No God, don't take him from me!"  But by the time she got there, she feared he already had gone   She got to where he lay, water-colored roses in his hands for her  She threw them down screaming, "Damn you man, don't leave me  With nothing left behind but these cold paintings, these cold portraits  To remind me!"   He said, "Love I leave, but only a little, try to understand  I put my soul in this life we created with these four hands  Love, I leave, but only a little, this world holds me still  My body may die now, but these paintings are real."   So many seasons came and many seasons went And many times she saw her love's face watering the flowers,  Talking to the trees and singing to his children  And when the wind blew, she knew he was listening,  And how he seemed to laugh along, and how he seemed to hold her When she was crying   'Cause they were painters and they were painting themselves A lovely world   Eighty years, an old lady now, sitting on the front porch  Watching the clouds roll by, they remind her of her lover  How he left her and of times long ago, when she used to color carelessly,  Painted his portrait a thousand times, or maybe just his smile,  And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go  Yes, she and her canvas still follow   Because they are painters and they are painting themselves  A lovely world    Painters by Jewel

      My bones are tired, Daddy I don't get enough sleep I don't eat as good as I could, Daddy What's that say about me?   Sometimes I sleep past noon, Daddy Drink lots of black coffee and I smoke like a chimney Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy What's that say about me?   Sometimes I want to rip out your throat, Daddy For all those things you said that were mean Gonna make you just as vulnerable as I was, Daddy What's that say about me?   Sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy Gonna use your tongue as a stamp Gonna rip your heart out the way you did mine, Daddy Go ahead and psycho-analyze that   'Cause I'm your creation, I'm your love, Daddy Grew up to be and do all those sick things you said I'd do Well last night I saw you sneak out your window With your white hood, Daddy What's that say about you?   I'm sloppy, what's that say about you? I'm messy, what's that say about you? My bones are tired, Daddy    Daddy by Jewel

      Hues of azure and yellow paint, Lighted every corner of her heart. Cold ice was replaced by fire, An ever imagination of her art.  Every picture, canvas or raverie, Tells everybody, "This is me." The one who wears a mask, And tries to be happy.  Her heart is just not cold. Just filled with sadness, regret and nostalgia. Once her mind had been bold, But memories made her fade away fast.  A room filled with cans of yellow paint, Trying to cover up every inch of blue. Oustide a stormy weather rained, And inside her heart, it rained too.  Is it tears of happiness, For being strong to move on? Or is it sadness, That she can't let go of what happened so long.  Paints streaks of yellow paint, Trying to cover up the blue. Dawn to dusk to twilight's name, Morning glow to sunset to the shade of the moon.  She waits, and waits, hoping for a sign, She asks herself if she could forget. She would move on, back in line. But she could never forget something so sad     Written by Drifting Heart *Me and my guitar are one* *Me and my guitar are one in eternity*

      Selena Quintanilla Perez was born to Abraham Quintanilla Jr. and Marcela Quintanilla on April 16, 1971, Easter Sunday, in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father was a respected Latino musician who performed with a local group called Los Dinos. By the time Selena was 10 years old, she began performing with them alongside her brother Abraham Quintanilla III and sister Suzette Quintanilla in the group Selena y Los Dinos. Even though Selena’s native language was English, she sang mostly in Spanish in a style known as Tejano.   Selena y Los Dinos played everywhere that they could, streets, weddings, etc. Their hard work paid off and Selena recorded her first album in 1984 under the Freddie label titled “Mis Primeras Grabaciones”, “My First Recordings”. Her second album “Alpha was released in 1986. At the Tejano Music Awards, she took the award for Female Vocalist of the Year. Her career was really beginning to take off.   In 1988, two more albums were released, “Preciosa”, meaning “Precious” and “Dulce Amor” meaning “Sweet Love”. In 1989 was a good year for Selena. She was signed with Capitol/EMI Latin label. Selena y Los Dinos, which was once a three-person group, expanded. Pete Astudillo joined the group, but then left in 1993 to go solo.   Selena met a guitarist named Chris Perez who had performed with the popular singer Shelly Lares and had his own band. The Quintanilla family hired him to be in the band in 1990. On April 2, 1992, they got married. It was against her father’s wishes to get married though. He thought he was not good enough for her, but they got married anyway.   In 1990, a fan who approached Selena’s father with the idea of starting a fan club, Yolanda Saldivar, made it happen. She also became a very close friend of Selena’s. Her next album “Ven Conmigo” meaning they see with me was released that same year. Another album was released in 1994 titled “Amor Prohibido” meaning “Prohibited Love”   On March 31, 1995, Yolanda Saldivar, during a financial dispute with Selena shot her in her right shoulder and was pronounced dead two hours later. Selena was a beautiful woman and a wonderful singer, she would be missed by many people. She made such a contribution to the American culture and the Spanish culture. She sang in both Spanish and and English and made a big difference in people's life with her music.

      What makes this world go round Will the answer let her down She is so sweet and young And her life has just begun What does her future hold that's the story left unknown Will she make it through her days, let our love lead the way  Part of me laughs  Part of me cries Part of me wants to question why What good is their joy And why is there pain  Why is there sunshine and the rain One day you're here Next you are gone No matter what we must go on Just keep the faith And let love lead the way Everthing will work out fine If you let love, love lead the way  Sitting there all alone In the window of her room Watching the world go by Brings tears to her eyes All she sees is hurt and pain, she wants to break the chain She'll keep pressing everyday and she'll find her own sweet way  Part of me laughs  Part of me cries  Part of me wants to question why  One day you're here  Next you are gone  No matter what we must go on  Just keep the faith And let love lead the way   You can be all that and still can be who you are You gotta know for sure that it isn't make believe You may feel weak but you are strong Don't you give up if If you keep holding on, you'll never be wrong Just close your eyes cause it lies deep in your heart  Part of me laughs Part of me cries  Part of me wants to question why  Why is thee pain Why is there sunshine then the rain One day you're here  Next you are gone  No matter what we must go on  Just keep the faith And let love lead the way Everthing will work out fine If you let love, love lead the way Love lead the way

      I’ve been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain You say I’ve been driving you crazy And it’s keeping you away  So just give me one good reason Tell me why I should stay ‘Cause I don’t wanna waste another moment In saying things we never meant to say  And I take it just a little bit I hold my breath and count to ten I’ve been waiting for a chance to let you in  If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I’ll know everything is alright Breathe Every little piece of me You’ll see Everything is alright If I just breathe  Well it’s all so overrated I’m not saying how you feel So you end up watching chances fade And wondering what’s real  And I give you just a little time I wonder if you realize I’ve been wanting ‘til I see it in your eyes  If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I’ll know everything is alright Breathe Every little piece of me You’ll see Everything is alright If I just breathe  So I whisper in the dark Hoping you’ll hear me Do you hear me?  If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I’ll know everything is alright Breathe Every little piece of me You’ll see Everything is alright If I just breathe  Everything is alright if I just breathe I’ve been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain

      I didn’t notice But I didn’t care I tried being honest But that lead me nowhere I watched the station Saw the bus pulling through And I don’t mind saying A part of me left with you  One of these days I won’t be afraid of staying with you I hope and I pray Waiting to find a way back to you ‘Cause that’s where I’m home  Did I make you nervous? Did I ask for too much? Was I not deserving one second of your touch?  One of these days I won’t be afraid of staying with you I hope and I pray Waiting to find a way back to you ‘Cause that’s where I’m home  What would you do if I could have you? Oh if I could I’d let you feel everything I’m thinking Wouldn’t that be nice? One of these days I won’t be afraid of staying with you

      Hands, you are talented  You color bring paintings to life You bring music to life But you do hurtful things  Eyes, you see the seven wonders ot the world You show kindness You show happiness But your hurtful stares kill  Feet, you bring dances to life You walk great distances You run miles But u go to unthinkable places  Tounge, u say sweet things You speak your way You sing lovely melodies But you always hurt hearts at the sharp end of whad you say  Mind, you have a endless imagination You think of impossible things You weave wonderful creations But your harbour holds ships of evil thoughts  Can we ever trust whad our body and mind does for us? How do we control them? We can... I know we can... ...

      Let's go back Back to the beginning Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned  'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect Trying to fit a square into a circle Was no lie I defy  Let the rain fall down And wake my dreams Let it wash away My sanity 'cause I wanna feel the thunder I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean  I'm shedding Shedding every color Trying to find a pigment of truth Beneath my skin  'cause different Doesn't feel so different And going out is better Then always staying in Feel the wind  Let the rain fall down And wake my dreams Let it wash away My sanity 'cause I wanna feel the thunder I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean  I'm coming clean Let the rain fall Let the rain fall I'm coming clean  Let the rain fall down And wake my dreams Let it wash away My sanity 'cause I wanna feel the thunder I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean   Let's go back Back to the beginning   Come Clean by Hilary Duff

      Goodbye To You  Of all things I believed in I just wanna get it over with Tears formed behind my eyes But I do not cry Counting the days pass me by  I’ve been searching deep down in my soul Words that I’m hearing are starting to get old Feels like I’m starting all over again The last three years are just pretend and I said  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I can’t live a day without you Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded by the light And it’s not right  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  And it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time I want what’s yours and I want what’s mine I want you, but I’m not giving in this time  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  Goodbye to you Goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  And when the stars fall I will lie awake You’re my shooting star    Goodbye to You by Michelle Branch

      Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights  Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  To the twilight  There's a dead end to my left  There's a burning bush to my right  You aren't in sight  You aren't in sight   Do you want me  Like I want you  Or am I standing still  Beneath a darkened sky  Or am I standing still  With the scenery flying by  Or am I standing still  Out of the corner of my eye  Was that you passing me by   Mothers on the stoop  Boys in souped-up coupes  On this hot summer night  Between fight and flight  Is the blind man's sight  And a choice that's right  I roll the window down  Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town  Feel broken down  Feel broken down   Do you want me  Like I want you  Or am I standing still  Beneath a darkened sky  Or am I standing still  With the scenery flying by  Or am I standing still  Out of the corner of my eye  Was that you passing me by     Sweet sorrow - He said call tomorrow  Sweet sorrow - He said call tomorrow     Standing Still by Jewel

      One less call to answer Feeling full of despair Don't think I can get through it Just one last prayer And it's a leap of faith When you believe There's someone out there It's a leap of faith When you believe that Someone cares, oh And when I call out to you Will you be right there Right there  Searching for the answer Nobody seems to care Oh how I wish that You were here Beside me To wipe away my tears  And it's a leap of faith When you believe There's someone out there It's a leap of faith When you believe That someone cares, oh And when I call out to you Will you be right there Right there  Waiting for the answer Remembering times We would share Somehow I feel You here beside me Even though you're not there  And it's a leap of faith When you believe there's Someone out there It's a leap of faith When you believe that Someone cares, oh And when I call out to you Will you be right there  Right there And I'll be waiting By the window for Your smile to come through And I'll be waiting In the darkness when I call out to you And I'll remember When you told me I could trust in you  And it's a leap of faith When you believe There's someone out there It's a leap of faith When you believe That someone cares, oh And when I call out to you Will you be right there It's a leap of faith And I believe that You are out there It's a leap of faith and I believe you truly care, oh And when I call out to you I know you'll be right there Right there And it's a leap of faith.

      Ophelia drowned in the water Crushed by her own weight And Hitler loved little blue-eyed boys and it drove him to hate. Birds always grow silent before the night descends Cause nature has a funny way of breaking what does not bend  A hero's torso built of steel and novicane His heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill So he found himself a whore to love while daisies choked on the windowsill  We've made houses for hatred It's time we make a place where People's souls may be seen and made safe Be careful with each other these fragile flames Innocence can't be lost it just needs to be maintained  A small town in Ohio, 2 boys are filled with violence As night in the darkness spreads it's legs for hate and ignorance. We are given to a god to put his faith therein But to be forgiven we must first believe in sin.  We've made houses for hatred It's time we make a place where People's souls may be seen and made safe Be careful with each other these fragile flames Innocence can't be lost it just needs to be maintained  Strange current pulling, a sleepless ebb and flow. Me, I drift sideways, and you, I don't know. I want to live bravely and love without fear. I want to always feel the wings of great near. We all will be Christed when we hear ourselves say we are that to which we pray.  We've made houses for hatred It's time we make a place where People's souls may be seen and made safe Be careful with each other these fragile flames Innocence can't be lost it just needs to be maintained.

      Lonestar where are you out tonight? This feeling I'm trying to fight It's dark and I think that I would give anything For you to shine down on me  How far you are I just don't know The distance I'm willing to go I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky Hoping for some kind of sign    Lonestar by Norah Jones

      I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have My mind and heart playing tricks like that I won't give in, I won't give in But I think I already have I feel so disappointed in myself For being so confused I know it's hurting you and me as well To make you feel used Sorry isn't enought to make things all ok Everytime you wanna love me, I can't find the words to say Maybe I'm not ready, maybe I'm lost Im my heart I'll always be in the frost No one will walk with me in this world I'm on my own to be an independant girl When I cry, I dry my own tears When I'm scared, I confront my own fears People may be with me, but that's a part of some In the end I'm still alone in the long run I'll watch the sunrise alone I'll embrace the empty air I'll talk to the dial tone Cause I am someone nothing can share They won't know how I feel I won't know theirs either But I know it's not simple but real To watch me wither   Written by Drifting Heart

      She glanced at him and bites her lip A indecisive frown across her face Silence passed as long as sleep Time had begun it's race  Words are swimming in her head But she doesn't know where to start She know's that it's getting late If she's doesn't say from her heart  But yet she think some things are better left unsaid She doesn't want to say the wrong things "I don't want him to fill with hate," "Or it's just another fling."  I'm still thinking if i should say it or not Or my words would make u run away I'm also afriad the words I forgot Would actually make you wanna stay    Written by Drifting Heart

      Notice me  Take my hand  Why are we  Strangers when  Our love is strong  Why carry on without me?   Everytime I try to fly  I fall without my wings  I feel so small  I guess I need you baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you baby   I make believe  That you are here  It's the only way  I see clear  What have I done  You seem to move on easy   Everytime I try to fly  I fall without my wings  I feel so small  I guess I need you baby  Everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you baby   I may have made it rain  Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song is my sorry   At night I pray  That soon your face  Will fade away   Everytime I try to fly  I fall without my wings  I feel so small  I guess I need you baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you baby     Everytime by Britney

      Ninety miles outside Chicago  can't stop driving I don't know why  So many questions, That need an answer  Two years later, you're still on my mind   Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart Who holds the stars up in the sky  Is true love just once in a lifetime  Did the captain of the Titanic cry?   Someday we'll know  If love can move a mountain  Someday we'll know  Why the sky is blue  Someday we'll know why I wasn't meant for you   Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?

      You have a way, of making me feel guilty Of not doing what you want me to do Do I really have to say 'Yes' all the while?  You have a way, of making me feel small Of not thinking what you want me to think The flesh that you had hurt is still feeling raw  Why do you like making me run about? You won't let me out from you sight Don't make small things seem loud You always make me oblige Always make me oblige  Everyone has their rights but I don't have mine Let me tell you that this is not kind Not meaning to make rude wors rhyme  You have a way of making me feel small Of not thinking what you want me to think The flesh that you had hurt is still feeling raw  Why do you like making me run about? You won't let me out from your sight Don't make small things seem loud You always make me oblige Always make me oblige    Written by Drifting Heart

      If only i was given the focus To forget only you I do  If only I was give the power To erase you from my memory I do  If only I was able to turn back time And not make you feel like mine I do  If only God could make love unselfish To bring a fairytale ending to lovers' wish I do  If only God could make us mortals immune to absence As absence makes the heart grow fonder I won't  Because if only He did that I wouldn't know what's love How is it like to miss you so bad  Because if only He did that I wouldn't know how to treasure And i'll be happier to feel sad  Because if he only did that I wouldn't know that a love painful, could be beautiful No one could ever get  If only I've said something I wouldn't feel indebt to you I do  If only my heart could no longer drift I can love with no doubts If only  But my heart is still drifitng   Written by Drifting Heart   *me and my guitar are one* *me and my guitar are one in eternity*

      It was distant country where it was distant future It was the distant memory where it was the thinking which is distant You certainly directly from before The round you swore love in order to meet You probably will speak until now  You probably will speak the thing from tomorrow more As for Never End Never End Our future Never End Never End our tomorrow Anyone who looks at Fantasy dream looks at dream It is innumerable, it is easy, supporting Directly, it was miracle, you had drawn directly Certainly it is important understands at last You have lived and must be even at day of tear But if it is not accustomed, you must be, Without pardon the time it continues to cut It does and hearts holds down and continues to walk As for Never End Never End Our future Never End Never End our tomorrow It is innumerable, it is easy, supporting The wind of the memory which is not forgotten blows As for Never End Never End Our future Never End Never End our tomorrow Anyone who looks at Fantasy dream looks at dream It is innumerable, it is easy, supporting As for Never End Never End our future Never End Never End our tomorrow

      When this time meeting, we would like to become gentler  The shoulder moving aside in this town of December  We would like to laugh  The word which does not have accidental way back meaning T he profile of white breath reviewing The slope powder snow where the shoestring can come off falling  Don't you think?  Your back it had shone&nbsp;a little the adult  The distance two  Just a little it had made far   When we would like to be together You thought for the first time  When you insert together, also this winter directly  When this time meeting, we would like to become gentler   Connecting the hand on this road of December,  We would like to walk Don't you think?  The north wind goodbye is Y form road here which is blown  Because the chest becomes painful, it probably will start walking first  Even promise how word it cannot put out to the mouth  Long separation it is to place, is not  After the releasing section to act playfully  Don't you think?  Name favorite of the child you heard  Now you cannot hear at all   When we would like to be together  You thought for the first time  When you insert together Cold wintery wind seems also the sky. . .  When this time meeting, we would like to become gentler  Being in Christmas side  The thinking drill you hold and would like to close  When we would like to be together, you thought for the first time  When you insert together, the night when the snow falls  Directly together... Together...

      Whisper rainy sound being soon, shaking, the shadow  Which does the fingertip as for the current cloud which can be pulled out flowing,  The&nbsp;cloud shining awakes in the picture  Hold me making be effective  Angel and come close to me  We want being able to serve with the easy pupil  Either pain it is not bad, if it pulls out you feel  It may be accustomed being transparently, when it adjusts the lip  Forever forever this way  Hold me making be effective  Angel and come close to me  The time when it appears in the easy pupil  Being blown far far in the wind  Directly directly...  Hold me making be effective  Angel and come close to me  We want supporting with the easy pupil  Angel and come close to me let me know your truth  I won't change my tomorrow  Angel and make my dream come true  It is deep, deeply in the pupil...  Directly, we would like to stare you  directly, directly

      It floats blankly in the sky  To look at month  Don't you think?  End of the summer it was effective in the wind  Going out the bosom oak which applied it is,  Blue memory reviving, the fact that among other things kindness is painful so Don't you think?  you passed either the technique which you know without  It overflows with without aim  At that laughter with classroom  About is dazzling also the look which shines  The dream which leaves unnoticed  Remembering  It is soft blowing to the wind  The everyday life which becomes far you run with absorption and come out  How, and others passing  The people whom it loves are  Without forgetting  You have laughed truly from heart?  In the world where it is obstructed in the wall of lie  As for truth without either sound  It deteriorates, in the darkness even if front  Also not being visible, without fearing, it dashes,  It is accustomed strongly with thing  Therefore expectation  The hand is extended,&nbsp;&nbsp;of love In order not to go out, deeply you will hold strongly and will close As for you there is no one person with anytime  What is believed and what is sought, stopping understanding Even then tomorrow the empty it comes  Positive it is dazzling it shines,  Pouring the everyday life which becomes far you run with absorption and come out  As for you everything which is protected  The hand is extended, of love  In order not to go out, deeply you will hold strongly and will close  The people whom it loves being without forgetting

      I talked to my friend today.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the usual problem...you know what I mean right  Well, of course...  I mean, I understand her, as if I haven't been through this kinda shit before  I think almost every girl has...  At that moment I want to tell her what I think, what I feel, but I don't seem to be able to.  That's strange. What do yo mean?  I mean, I can't tell her what's in my mind. I wish that she could go inside my memories and understand better from there.  (Laughs)  Don't laugh. It always had been that way.  You're a weird person.  Yes, I know. Thank you. But then, talking to her brings back memories. I hate those.  People treasure their memories, but you hate them.  (Long silence) Yes.  Everything hurts. It's inevitable.   As if I don't know that already.   Cool down. Don't get so mad.   I'm trying not to. I'm tempremental these days. Stressed...  Ah...then you should go and rest...  (Feeling defeated) Yeah, I guess so. Sleep is what I need...  Sleep...forget about everything  (Dreamy mode) Everything hurts...

      Part One:   Raven. That was her name. It suited her fine. Her beautiful long black hair hung behind her back. As black as a raven.&nbsp; She had beautiful dark eyes too.&nbsp; Her hair and her eyes stood out prominently from her fair features. And she sang beautifully at the bar where she worked, called The Spirit Cove. There were plenty of bar girls, but none of them as decent and beautiful as Raven. Some of them were jealous, of her talent and beauty, how she seemed to capture the whole room with her beautiful voice, like when the Sirens had lured men to capsize their ships on the rocks.&nbsp; Except, how she captured people’s attention into paradise.  There was a good reason for the bar girls to be jealous. Number one, she has a beautiful voice and looks to match. Number two; she had a decent job where she didn’t have to use her body to make money. Number three; she earned more money then them.&nbsp; Lee Ann, the most beautiful next to Raven, pouted her red lips towards Raven as she filled three mugs of beer for three ugly and leering men sitting on a table not far away. “Raven can keep a distance from them and I can’t.” she muttered to herself. She plunked the mugs unhappily into the tray and pushed in next to her home girl. “Erin, take theses to those fat bastards there.” She nodded her head to their direction. Erin shrugged and picked up the tray. She set the tray on the table and gave them their drinks. She eased the tray to her hip and held up her palm. One man slapped a generous fifty-dollar bill on her palm and smacked her buttocks.&nbsp; Erin rolled her eyes and walked back. “At least I didn’t get smacked for nothing." as she passed Lee Ann and deposited the note into the cashier.  Lee Ann laughed and snapped open her compact mirror and checked her image. Her cat-like features glared back at her as thoughts about her life spurned in her head.&nbsp; Being poor, no abilities unlike Raven, as she stole a look at the dark-haired song stress. Lousy job, low pay, and get leered and touched by those filthy men. She might as well work as a prostitute. At least that brought in big money. If only I could sing like Raven, she thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   “Hey, Lee Ann!” shouted one of her bar girls, Miriam.&nbsp; “We’ve got a new girl!” Lee Ann slapped back the lid of her compact mirror and dropped it in her miniskirt pocket. A demure redhead stood before her.&nbsp; “Hi.” She greeted Lee Ann. “First day of work?” she asked. The redhead nodded.&nbsp; Lee Ann scrutinized her up and down. “What’s your name?” she asked. “Phoenix.” she replied. Lee Ann’s perfectly plucked eyebrow raised an arch. “Phoenix? What kind of a name is that?” The redhead looked at her. “My street name. I had it for quite some time.&nbsp; I also used it when I was working at the brothel.” Lee Ann was surprised. “You work as a prostitute?” Phoenix chewed her bottom lip. “Yeah. What’s the big deal?&nbsp; I was sold to those places since I was twelve. Can you believe it? I lost my chastity at the age of twelve. I wasn’t even a teenager yet.” Okay, thought Lee Ann. Her life’s worse. At least I’m clean. She smiled to herself. Then the laughter of the three ugly bastards broke into her thoughts. She turned behind to glare at them. Okay, maybe not that clean. A bit of gray won’t hurt right? “Alright.” Lee Ann said. “Miriam,” she told the blond standing a distance away. “Take Phoenix, and show her what to do, okay.” Miriam stepped forward and took Phoenix’s arm. “Yeah, alright.” The two of them walked to the storeroom. Lee Ann glanced at the stage. Raven wasn’t there anymore. “She must have knocked off. And we still have to entertain those ugly bastards here.” She muttered angrily to herself as she caught the three men having their hungry eyes all over her. She turned away and mopped the bar counter furiously.

      I love this clothing It was my favorite A white blouse and everything With designs all around  I was careful, not to ruin this perfectness The pristine white that shone Like an angel in her loveliness It was never mixed with grey, black or brown  It was one careless mistake That washing the laundry Would never be the same That changed it's innocence  Everytime I dump clothes in the machine Put in the soap powder and everything I would be constantly reminded of it How the innocence and purity used to be  As for that blouse I tried to bleach it but it was no use The grey, black and brown took house in it It looked so sad, it looked so accused  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; When the flames goes out, Would you ever wish it would light back?  Wish that you said the words in you heart?  Said the things that will soothe the soul  When the flames goes out  Cause you poured cold water  Didn't you wish you've never done that?  Or at least pour fuel instead.  When the flames goes out,  Did you ever wish that the wind never came  Didn't you wish you would protect it  That the dying flames wasn't your fault  When the flames goes out,  Would you wish that it would fade away thinking of you Or maybe just it knows that you cared and it meant something to you  That it would leave feeling loved  When the flames goes out  Don't you think that it went out too soon  Or maybe you could say or do something to make it stay  That it knew that someone needed them &nbsp; When the flames go out,  Don't you think that its useless to think about it  Or try to make things change because of a mistake  It'll work, don't give up, cause you can stop other flames from going out

      Tell me what is the meaning of a solo bird? Hm...a bird on it's own, flying high and free. That must be nice...how I wish I could be like that... Well, that isn't necessary good all the time... What do you mean? What I mean is that a free bird does not mean it's happy Hm...you got a point... To be happy, you must know what you really want...more like what your heart really wants... I see. What if I don't know? Then you've got to find out. How do I find out? (Silence) You're on your own...

      Everytime I want to say something, I can't Close my eyes and hink of the snow in my heart Is the time up? Is it the moment? The remaining loneliness Why the moment I open the door He didn't light my heart  He doesn't know, he still don't know Leaving was only Heaven's will: Stay away from me If I say what's in my heart It will be the warmth I desire  He doesn't know, forever won't know An embrace could be everything This love must have been enough  What I want would have been loneliness I sigh my woes in the cold and it floats away The past memories holds a grudge in my heart he didn't say a word but my tears flowed It's not that he didn't give enough It's that I don't know what&nbsp;I want  He doesn't know, he still don't know Leaving was only Heaven's will: Stay away from me If I say what's in my heart It will be the warmth I desire  He doesn't know, forever won't know An embrace could be everything This love must have been enough  Beacuse I had harboured too many wishes My shooting star had been too heavy It's time for my heart to go back  He doesn't know, he still don't know Leaving was only Heaven's will: Stay away from me If I say what's in my heart Will be the warmth I desire  He doesn't know, forever won't know An embrace could be everything This love must have been enough

       I'm really sorry. I don't know how to help you. I want to give up, but I can't, because I know if I do, you will just fade away into nothing and I don't want that to ever happen. I want to rush up to your mom and wake her up. I want her to&nbsp;open her&nbsp;eyes and see what her negliance had turned her children into. Yet,&nbsp;I'm in no&nbsp;position to do that. You're&nbsp;your her daughter. There is so many choices open to you. Choose one and work on it. If that doesn't work keep on trying. If you sit back and give up, you're family has no hope, because you know that your family is in a mess, and you don't do anything, you're harming them even more. I only can do so much as to give you advice but&nbsp;I can't carrry it out for you. Do you really want to walk down the aisle ten years later alone?&nbsp;Do you want to&nbsp;give birth to kids who doesn't have a grandma to look after? Your parents won't be there for your greatest joy and sorrow&nbsp;if you don't tell them. I'm sorry to say that, I think you're parents are waiting for a tradegy to happen to realize.  &nbsp;

        Hey little sister, I heard you went to mister so-and-so, Knock, knock, knocking on his doorAgain last night, said you needed it bad.You know that ain't right.'Cause so many times you've come to me cry, crying, Trying to stop, you said it hurts so badBut please don't let youGo back for more.My little sisiter is a zombie in a bodyWith no soul; in a role she has learned to play,In a world today where nothing else matters.But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls, Not our addictions or afflictions of pain.To aviod the same questions we must Ask ourselves to get any answers,We gotta start feeding our souls...Have been lost to the millions with lotsWho feed on addiction selling pills and what's hot.I wish I could save her from all their delusions,All the confusion,Of a nation that starves for salvation.But clothing is the closest approximationTo God and He only knows that drugs Are all we know of love.Ev'ry day we starve while we eat white breadAnd beer instead of a handshake or hug.We spill the pills and sweep them under the rug.My little sister is a zombie in a bodyWith no soul; in a role she has learned to play, In a world today where nothing else matters.But it matters, we gotta start feeding our souls. Hey little sister i heard that you went to Mister So-and-So Knock, knock, knocking on his door again last nightand said you needed more.

      The angel and the devil got married And wedded in a church in a mile The threw a party in hell and carried A bastard child  Sorry God, if that offended you Sorry Satan if that offended you I just want to make things two different  The sun and the moon fell in love And ran away to their paradise The earth protesed the love above And the stars cried  Sorry if that offended you Sorry if that didn't make you see the way I do I just want to make things two different  I meant to love you and I will always do I just fell behind lagged a little  Moments not with you I'll be thinking of you Sorry that my mind is bone brittle  Sorry if that offended you Sorry if that didn't make you see the way I do I just want to make things two different

      Don't pick me to be your stress ball I'm not a solid to break your fall You can scream at me, but I can block Go ahead and change the colour of my socks  You're eating in my bones and scraping at my flesh Metal against metal, two hands noisily clashed Smoked my eyes, and burnt my skin Planted the hate in me within  I'll file my nails everywhere I'll curse you telepathically for all I care Feed you rat posion, see you writhe on the floor The soon the better you're out of my door  Breaking me emotionally and mentally Mixing my feelings like paint Breaking me happyily but sadly I'm breaking you too, you'll slowly go insane

      When the pressure will not fade away When the real things starts to become fake When you can’t recognize your own hands Turn around and begin again  When the sky starts ripping and falling And the horizon is no longer calling please Don’t try to make it on emptiness Turn around and begin again  But I have wondered about what it is all for But I can do no more than shout And I am still standing unsure  If your eyes become glazed with indifference If your screaming with lips that are silent If you can’t find light in the day Turn around and begin again  But I have wondered about what it is all for But I can do no more than shout And I am still standing unsure  When you cannot find yourself anywhere If your standing but feel your not really there If your waiting for someone to catch you Turn around and begin again  If you can’t seem to find what’s been to be found In a heart that pumps rage as your only sound If your waiting to be blown away Turn around and begin again  But I have wondered about what it is all for But I can do no more than shout And I am still standing unsure  But now and then Now and then I wonder.

      One day, a girl said to her friend, "Do you want to know what is my dream home?" The friend shook her head and asked,"What is it then?" The girl smiled and pointed to the sky, a cloud drifting lone  Sometimes I wish that when bad things happen, we could just run Sometimes I wish that we could just fly away But sometimes we never know that trouble will not come again We never know when we'll miss it till the very 'One' day  I wish I could get the butterfiles and feathers To lift me up to air Take me away from those dead matters Spirit me to somewhere  Sometimes I wish I can go to sleep And live a new life in my dream Away from old people to new places To a place where there's new faces  I'll like to dream to butterfiles, feathers and clouds Things to take me away Fly me to my dream home To paradise we all crave  I'll sleep forever in the cold To make my time pass slow I'll wake up to see only white and blue And think about only you  The only bad thing is when the neighbors come to stay She kicks me out and paints my walls grey She invited her friends home in her own way It's then when I'm kicked back to earth again

      We have bigger houses but smaller families; More conveniences, but less time; We have more knowledge, but less judgment; More experts, but more problems; More medicines, but less healthiness; We’ve been all the way to the moon and back, But have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor  We built more computers to hold more information to produce more copies ever, But have less communication; We have become long on quantity, But short on quality These are times of fast food; But slow digestion; Tall man but short character; Steep profits but shallow relationships It’s a time when there is much in the window, but nothing in the room

      Enter through the window Lying there asleep She drifting across the room Into his dream  Almost blended with the curtains Hanging everywhere Almost disappeared with the breeze Lured into his lair  "I'm fading, I'm fading..." she sings into his ear He twitches, he shifts under her moaning lullaby She cries she drops tears and they are falling on his face They slides down and evaporated and she continues to cry  He wakes, he wonders the song that haunted his dreams Was it real or was it fate that was something meant to be Through the hours passed the sad song playing in his mind He wondered, he craved for answers he'll find tonight  He pretends to be asleep Waiting for that voice Real or dream He will pry on every noise  Soon a tinkling bell sounded and the breeze began to rise He panics, but was calm, still in his disguise "I'm fading, I'm fading..." the voice cried out again This time he turned to the sound and open his eyes  He sees her face deja vu washes over him That face, that face, somewhere in his dream "I'm fading, I'm fading..." the sad voice cried over agian "Love me before I fade or I afraid I'm insane"  "Don't want to know you don't love me when I'm half-alive" "Worser still when I'm mostly dead." "Tell me why, tell me why," "Or am I just to late"  "You're not late." he tells her "You'll be better off without me." "I can't give you the happiness here and thereafter." "Why till now you still can't see?"  "Have you forgotten. have you forgotten?" she said "Oh, have I become a dream?" "What have we done to make this happen?" "Or will I forever be in your sleep."  "You can't love me in the day." "You can't be with me, I'm not real anymore." "I exist in you imagination, in our play," "At least love me before dawn"  "If I can't have it whole, I'll only take half" "In which I'll do my part" "I know you can give me any love from the start" "Before I fade I'll give you my heart."

      Under the shadows, forbidden and hot Desire grows, more often than not  I'm sorry's a stupid thing to say Especially considering it's not like I planned it this way  But I'm sorry is all that there is left of me I'm so sorry this love left me hollow and made you empty  Maybe I could have loved you better Maybe you should have loved me more Maybe our hearts were just next in line Maybe everything breaks sometime Everything breaks sometime  It's hard to believe its boiled down to this It seems so surreal this won't be healed by a kiss It's hard to stare at you knowing you like I have I used to feel so close, now I feel so bad  My heart's filled with thunderstorms and I'm ready to burst And I've lost my favorite harbor and I'll weather for the worst  Maybe I could have loved you better Maybe you should have loved me more Maybe our hearts were just next in line Maybe everything breaks sometime Everything breaks sometime I'm so sorry, everything breaks sometime

      I hate you I love you Leave, don't go away I can't decided if i like your face or If i wish it would stray  You're a child but you're malicious You're sweet but don't remember my name Heads I win, tails I'm lost Love equals pain  I am drifting, without an anchor Through your ambigious regions Strange continents, immune to all reason And I'm flattered, by your grey matter  Inside my skin, I feel your tongue It's telling me I'm dirty and licking my bones A scrap, against silence A kinfe against a plate Makes the sound of need on hate  I am drifting, without an anchor Through your ambigious regions Strange continents, immune to all reason And I'm flattered, by your grey matter  You're amusing You're a real cool show with your Meathooks and barbed wire carnival You got moth holes in your pocket You got moth holes in your soul From too many false teeth and greasy flash bulbs  I am drifting, without an anchor Through your ambigious regions Strange continents, immune to all reason And I'm flattered, by your grey matter And I'm flattered, by your grey matter

      Love is more than a feeling, it's a form of communication Love is selfish and unselfish Love is being able to smile though the tears and cry through the joy Love is being able to give up what you want most Love is giving love to someone and being loved in return Love is a feeling that words are not need for it to say Love is a gift that comes from the heart Love is doing something for someone even if it hurts you the most Love is being able to let go for someone else's happiness Love is the cause of all hate, jelously and evil Love is Care's next-door-neighbour Love will either make you or break you Love can bring about almost every eomtion is the world Love can make a good man or a bad man Love is the feel of having everything but having nothing Love is like a mystery candy have tastes of sweet, bitter, salty and  sour Love is a display of your deepest fears, thoughts and emotions Love is something that money can't replace Love never giving up Love is like a rose with many thorns Love makes the world go around Love is a river that flows endlessly Love is thinking and missing someone 24/7 Love is a thin line between hatred and compassion Love is part of hatred Love is a natural gif we find in our hearts Love is something you can learn and give Love is sometimes ignorance Love takes many forms Love blesses you when you are a good man and curses you when you sleep around Love

      It happens a lot and I don't understand why. The tears that fall are cold tears. Sometimes they are fine and soft. Sometimes they are fat and hard and angry. Why the sky is crying is a mystery. What could it have run into? Who could it be missing? Sometimes when the sky is crying I tilet my face upward and catch the tears on my cheeks, so that the sky's tears become my tears and I try to feel what the sky is feeling. But it never works. So I never know why the sky is crying.

      It's midnight, and you are still waiting For me to step out I can see your devilish sihoulette beckoning I wonder what you're all about  The beautiful angel in red Hiding a knife behind his back Don't you remember what you said And stole everything tgat I had  Angel by my window I can't let you in anymore 'Cause the knves that you keep and the posion thad you eat Tells me that you are not all gone Angel by my window I can't take you back my heart It's gone, it's lost and you have no home  You made me sleep with pins and broken glass Gave me a trail of kisses and say that I must Live in a heart of needles and pins To clear away all your sins  Why must I pay Pay with an emotion that tortures everyday With you standing by my window The angel by my window

      Night with its shattered teeth Attempts to speak My pen is present but Courage left via the sink And I'm sorry I snuck up on you From behind I'm sorry not all My love letters did rhyme And I'm sorry that Jesus died for my sins And I swear to God It won't happen again And I'm sorry If it was my swerve that Tempted you to sway Oh well Sometimes it be that way And Romeo was A very nice man He said "Jewel, I don't think You quite understand"  And I'm sorry if you had To explain it like this I'm sorry I was a point You were destined to miss And I'm sorry I spoke to you irreverently Down in the hollow By the old olive tree And I'm sorry If my heart breaking Ruined your day  Oh well Sometimes It be that way  I said "Oh well, I got nothing Left to sell This love was a bell that Rang unheard in the air I was bound to find out That you didn't care Oh well Sometimes it be that way  And Aphrodite with Her neon lamp Kissed Neptune They put her face On a stamp And I'm sorry I used it to mail A letter to you I'm sorry I'm glue and The rest bounces off of you And I'm sorry not even This jet's metal wings Could get across These simple things And I'm sorry If I ever sang Your name in vain Oh well Sometimes it be that way  And Goldilocks Well she knew three bears They all ate oatmeal And tiptoed upstairs And I'm sorry I never got to Find you like this Sleeping like a baby And swaddled in bliss And I'm sorry for All the times I forgot to imply something In between the lines And I'm sorry If my heart breaking Ruined your day Oh well Sometimes it be that way  I said "Oh well, I got nothing Left to sell This love was a bell that Rang unheard in the air I was bound to find out That you didn't care Oh well Sometimes it be that way  And shadow's long fingers They dance on the wall Electricity chases Its tail in the hall And I'm sorry If my arms to you Were just empty rooms I'm sorry I never could comfort you And I'm sorry St. Petersburg is A miserable town And I'm sorry If I am bringing you down And I'm sorry If I caused you pain Oh well Sometimes it be that way  And flame licks the air With its silver tongue Night has many hands But I have just one And I'm sorry I walked in on you Unexpectedly I'm sorry I never served you Camomile tea And I'm sorry I didn't always have a match That could start A fire big enough For your heart to catch And I'm sorry If it was my swerve that Tempted you to sway Oh well Sometimes it be that way

           Why do birds suddedenly appear  Everytime, you are near  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you     Why do stars fall down from the sky  Everytime, you walk by  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you     On the day that you were born   The angels got together  And decided to make a dream come true  So they sprinkled moondust in your hair  And golden starlight in your eyes so true     That is why, all the girls in town  Follow you, all around  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you

           You appeared and disappeared just like that. Why? You were the cause of that imagination. You made it seemed real. My friend told me I would be dillusional. Does that matter? It doesn't matter if it can make me happy. Some people say that fight anything for happiness. I'm not even fighting. I'm dreaming of it. Dreams and imaginations are separated by a fine line, but it seems to me that it has a big difference. Brown Moth, can I be your Moonlight Butterfly? The love you offer seems like a fantasy? I would like to fly. Very much.    You didn't seems so real the nights after that. it was only Violet who accompanied me. But he couldn't swim beyond my imagination. He just fills me with awe with his shades of purple. He's truly beautiful. I'm glad I bought it. he's just like me. I tried to dream you up. You didn't come. You weren't so real. But I glad you dropped by my room that night. Sorry I chased you out. That was impolite of me. But still, you left on your own accord. I couldn't really see your face. All I know is that you had dark brown hair falling over your eyes. But you are no more but just a memory now. It's just Violet and me.

      As for your word kindliness kana of dream? Hiding lies entirely, don't you think? The cool back showing in you who go on a journey, You had heard, the one person it fights, don't you think? "The empty it returns" your voice nature which is surpassed stretching Resetting the time of strong, if you shouted, it was good? Without going, when the tear you drop? Now, what kind of thing which it is possible  Word of 1000 where you could not say is sent Your back changing into the wing Word of 1000 where you could not say You draw close to your back which is hurt and hold and close  As for the continuation of dream while thinking you, Thing of that day you forgot, doing to shake, don't you think? "Because the letter is written", The gaze your voice nature which is bent stretching, Resetting the time of strong, if you got angry, it was good? It cannot wait, that when you drop the shoulder? Now, what kind of thing which it is possible  Being audible, Word of 1000 is sent to your back which is not visible, changing into the wing Being audible, Word of 1000 you draw close to your back which becomes tired and hold and close Word of 1000 where you could not say Lalalala.. You send to your back, changing into the wing Being audible, Word of 1000 Lalalala.. You draw close to your back, Lalalalala....

      You took your coat off, and stood in the rain. You were always crazy like that. And I watched from my window, Always felt I was outside looking in on you. You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair. You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care. You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say, Besides some comment on the weather.  Well in case you failed to notice, In case you failed to see, This is my heart, bleeding before you, This is me down on my knees.  And these foolish games are tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart... You're breaking my heart.  You were always brilliant in the morning:Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you; You loved Mozart, And you'd speak of your loved ones, As I clumsily strummed my guitar.  Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else:Somebody who gave a damn, Somebody more like myself.  And these foolish games are tearing me, You're tearing me, you're tearing me apart. And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart... You're breaking my heart.  You took your coat off and stood in the rain; You were always crazy like that.
