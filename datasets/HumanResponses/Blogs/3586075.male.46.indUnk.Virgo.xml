						   OK, when I was in college making a move meant about 10-15 minutes loading stuff in the car and a some serious elbow grease cleaning.  Well, Vickie and I just helped Erin and her roommates move. They haven't been there a year mind you. But, let me tell you, two sets of parents, a couple of guys, a pickup, a big flat bed trailer and other cars and people too numerous to mention, started with donuts and Vickie and I were just putting the finishing things up about 11pm. Whew! Of course, next time she moves, it will include the new fridge they needed to rent this place. Funny how things accumulate!  It was a labor of love and it was a great time sharing a little sweat equity with friends. Things worked out great at the new digs. Things are just cute as they can be. One of Erin's roommates was off celebrating a birthday, imagine that, so since I had a hearing in Lubbock Monday, Vickie and I stayed the night with Erin. We took the chance to have supper over at Spanky's with Vickie's nephew Chad who is high jumping for Tech and his friend Dana, who pole vaults for Tech. Chad expects to know this week if he will get an invitation to the US Olympic team tryouts! I'm still trying to figure out how I can claim some credit for that guy's athletic abilities, buuut, since he is on the "wrong" side of the family for that to work, his dad isn't having any of that.   Saturday we went to an awards banquet put on by the Panhandle Professional Writer's Association. Michael was entered in the high school short story category. He won first place. Since the third place writer was from Bejing we just count it as a world wide competition. Michael continues to impress us with his way with words and flare for the imaginative. His stint with Americorp starts in a little over a month. He will be helping tutor younger kids in a school across town.   As for the weather... three inches in the last three days. No hail to get it. What's not to like?

						   Well, complain about no rain... and you get some. We got an inch of rain last night. In about 10 minutes. Along with 60 mile an hour wind and baseball sized hail.   http://www.amarillo.com/images/062204/feature_art_062204.jpg  Vickie and I drove by a local 10 story hospital. It looked like pictures of high rise hotels after a hurricane. All the windows smashed out, blinds and curtains out the windows. A car dealer about a mile south looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to every car on the lot.   When we heard the reports of the approaching storm we got Michael home. So, Vickie, Michael and I watched as the storm rolled in. Hail at least the size of tennis balls to baseballs would hit so hard they would bounce 6 to 8 feet up in the air. But, WE WERE LUCKY. Sounded like only 4 or 5 hit our house. But, we didn't have any big damage. A few limbs down. Some plants shredded. All in all, A-OK compared to what we just missed by a mile or so.   One of the tv weather vans with a wind speed indicator reported straight winds between Amarillo and Canyon of 130 MPH. Amarill even made the front page of CNN.  Steve might be interested in a report I read the other day about that little drought he mentioned they were having. Scientist say that the Colorado River over the last 5 years has run at its lowest volumes in 500 hundred years! The good news was that historically such deep droughts are short. Unfortunately, occaisionally it might mean the start of a droughth that lasts 30 years. But, as Amarillo found out... be careful what you wish for.

						   We had fun doing Erin's birthday today. Her friend Coby shared a brunch, cake and presents with us. Vickie and I thought we should help Coby get to know Erin like we do, so we pulled the video tape from her first birthday party to play during brunch. You wouldn't think a one year old could get cake spread around that much.   Michael got Erin a card that explained on the front it was for a spectacularly perfect sister, on the back of the glued together card it said "What are you doing trying to open it?" Michael and Erin had a blast watching what they did to each other when were little as the tape progressed. As every new sister engineered catastrophe came up, Michael would say: "See Erin, THAT'S why you got that card."  One of her "friends" on the tape of her first birthday was a little girl named Shelby. Her family moved when Erin was 4. They hadn't seed each other since. Last week Erin's roommate's boyfriend's roommate (got that) introduced Erin to his girlfriend... Shelby. They eyed each other pretty closely until towns and last names came up. Eureka.   When you look at that angelic face of our little 20 year old daughter, remember this story. I came in from riding my bike the other day. I'd been out about an hour and Erin, knowing that wind is kind of the bane of biking around here said: "Dad, looks like the wind finally died down and it was pretty cool out." So, I thanked her for her interest and decided I'd get a little rise out of her by letting her know it was a good ride but the weather had created new "problems". I said, "Yeah, but, with no wind and the cool weather the gnats where flying  all around so I had to spit bugs all the way back." Judging by the wrinkled up look on her face I think she thought this was pretty bad. As I started taking off my biking shoes Vickie walked in from the kitchen. Erin, sweet daughter that she is, motioned towards me and with great sympathy said, "Mom, Dad NEEDS a kiss!" Thinking maybe I'd had a tough ride Vickie dutifully gave me one right on the lips (hey, I'm just the straight man in Erin's little operation). Once Vickie asked why I needed a kiss and I re-told my story... the race between mother and daughter was ON!

						   I wish I could get paid to figure that one out! Our drinking water lake is at the lowest level on record. Our "wettest" 3 months of the year are May, June and July. May was 3d driest on record and a third of the way through June we have had 12% of normal precip for June so far. Looks like the rest of the state would gladly ship us some of the extra rain they are getting. No problem in the city, really, since we have all the reserves we need in the underground sources. Plus, missing the rain means no tornadoes.  We will be celebrating Erin's birthday this weekend. I'll try to get some pictures up soon.

						   Michael is in the summer conditioning program for his last year of football next year at Amarillo High. He is playing defensive end.   Erin is in doing well at Lubbock. Currently looking for a new rent house and taking six hours of summer classes. She will be heading to Phil in July with a freind.   Logistics of summer planning gets tighter every year. Just holding down the fort at the moment.

						   Well, so far I've set up and installed a blog, obtained the software to work with the digital picture software we have to manage our photos (Picasa and "Hello"), and transferred some digital pictures with captions. Let me know if I've committed any MAJOR gaffes (minor ones I hope will be ignored. :) ).

						   I'm in the process of trying out this "blog" thing to make it easy to stay in touch with friends and family and let folks now what's going on with the Naylors in Amarillo.  Hope to be adding photos and updates on our goings and comings as we get this thing up and going.  Later, Richard

						   I love when late July and August gets here so we can get to that fresh summer produce. The first thing to come off this year was Kiowa blackberries I planted three years ago. They are as big as golf balls. Put them in the icebox, add some whipped cream... ummmhh. We had so many Vicke made a dozeen jars of blackberry jam. I have frozen several quarts for winter snack attacks. Then the red Flame seedles grapes started getting ripe. They are the kind you usually see in the grocery stores. Sweet and crisp. Mine are a little small this year, but excellent. In another week or so the Vanessa a Canadice grapes will be ripe. Those are also crisp, but even sweeter than the Flames grapes. Almost taste like candy.    Yesterday Vickie, Erin and I made our annual first run to the Farmer's Market now that panhandle grown produce is getting ready. Today we had what is kind of a family tradition. A meal of fresh vegetables. Fried squash (can not beat it), fresh black-eyed peas, new potatos and corn on the cob. Who needs meat?! Oh, and Vickie fried up some Vidalia sweet onions to go with it. Yu--umm. Yep, pretty much felt like Thanksgiving afternoon around here today. :)    Can't wait to get hungry enough to eat the canteloupe getting good and cold in the icebox. With a little luck our home grown melons and canteloupe will start getting ready in a couple of weeks.     Unfortunately, one of the best home grown tastes, our oriental pears, that are sweet, tart and really crispy, got hit by an early warm spell and the frost got most of them. That should make next year's crop taste even better.

						   Our cat is named Zippy. So named because when Vickie gave it to the kids for Christmas when they were young they opened the box and it "zipped" out and straight under the couch where it remained for a couple of days.     It has grown into a cat that alternates between seeing people as "laps" to sit in and  purr contentedly and eying them like a lioness eyes a gazelle on the African plain. More frequently the latter. When it woke me up at 6:00 this morning wanting in the house from the garage, I wasn't surprised, the cat knows to a certainty I exist to satisfy her every whim. As is her custom, she wanted out the patio door to the outside (no doubt wanted to get an early start on her custom of  killing something and dragging it up on the porch - probably to show us what's next for us if we don't continue to  satisfactorily kowtow to her whims). Now I knew it was raining outside and she wouldn't actually go out, but, you know how it is trying to explain anything to a cat, so I open the patio door, which, she of course refused to go out. Thinking that had settled the issue, I went to get a cup of coffee. Well, the cat thinks I'm going after the paper out the front door, which I'm not because its raining. She then decides that  she wants out the front door. Now, only a cat having just seen it was raining on the side of the house would insist on seeing if it was raining in the front of the house, but, back to the uselessness of explaining things to a cat, so I open the front door for her.     Once she determined it was in fact raining just as much in the front as patio yard, she stays in. But, being a cat, has to have something to get in to. A few minutes later I'm going down the hall and she is crouching outside the   laundry room door cautiously peering into it like she has never seen the place before (I guess the fact that the door had been closed a few minutes caused her to worry it had been stocked with wild hyenas or something while the door was closed.) But, as it turns out she apparently can't hear me coming over the washing machine running. So, as I get even with her she is surprised. Startled when she "discovers" me, she jumps sideways on to my foot, is even more alarmed and so, true to her younger temperment, starts to "zip" off at full speed. The only problem is she is now pretty discombobulated and runs pell mell full speed into the hall wall opposite the laundry room. She survived. The good news was she was apparently sufficiently dazed to settle down and finally let me enjoy a cup of coffee without further cat mentality and attitude to deal with.

						   Erin and Lisa went, saw - got wet - had a GREAT time. Jonna and Janet took time off from work and showed them the town in New York and Phil. "Inside" tour guides are a real plus. Although, dear old Dad would have preferred a little less in the way of guided tours of every botique in sight. :) Oh well, guess you can take the girl out of the country but you can't take the shopper out of the girl.     I don't think they could have gotten more good stuff in or had a better time if they rehearsed for it.They came back pooped but just overflowing about all the fun. And... I'm pretty sure they learned alot!

						   Erin's friend Coby got a puppy this week. Erin and I took it in to our "family" vet, Larry Johnson. He weighed her in at 9.0 lbs. She is gonna get a little bigger though. Her dad was a Great Dane and her mom a Mastiff. 140 maybe?!   Michael's friend just picked him up to go to a movie in her new Hyundai Tiburon sports car. Also known as why parents get gray hair. :)  Vickie's foot, both of them, are better. Its either that or she is noticing them less because of the tough summer cold she has picked up. With a little bit of luck she will get well enough to go on vacation with us. Ha. I think if we ever get around to actually planning one we might have something for her to shoot for.  Erin is about to get off on her big trip. She is sooo excited. I'm sure she is going to have a great time. Aunt Jonna is gonna be in big trouble if she has TOO much fun, though.   Michael has done a great job of keeping our yard looking super this year. He finishes up sportsfit next week. He gets a few days off and starts captains camp to stay in shape until football starts in August. I'm pretty sure my summers spent driving a tractor 10-12 hours a day and drinking beer didn't keep me in as good a shape for football.He is strong with all those weights he has been lifting. Fortunatley for his dad, he appreciates the power of the purse, or at least gas credit cards.

						   Vickie had to take a spin in to a foot doctor to get her wheels checked out. Turns out she had a cracked heel bone (and heel spur) on one foot and two plantar warts that had to be cut out on the other one. Me and the dog have been telling her it wasn't good to be kicking things around so much. :)   She has been quite a sight trying to get around here the last couple of days without knowing which foot she ought to be limping on. The good news is that both feet are doing better slowly.  Speaking of the beagle, he has an amazing pechant for causing me personal duress. In addition to all the plants and property he has ruined (including the complete felling of a 25 foot tall tree in the backyard, really - e-mail me if you want the complete story) he managed to have me bleeding this weekend. I'm putting flea collars on the dogs. The big one sits there, let's me measure the collar and snip off the excess with a pair of scissors. Eddy? No, he sits there until at precisely the perfect moment, mid-cut, he takes off. My thumb and the scissors paid. I think I will survive, but, I worry about what that dog has in store for me next.   This year the City of Amarillo is moving the municipal fireworks show from the north side of town, about 10 miles away, to the big city park about a quarter mile from where our house is. So, Michael has decided to have a few friends (20 or 30) over to have a little party and do the fireworks. I think we will have fun, if nothing else, its a good excuse for chowing down on alot of carbs! And, hey, maybe one of them needs a beagle....
