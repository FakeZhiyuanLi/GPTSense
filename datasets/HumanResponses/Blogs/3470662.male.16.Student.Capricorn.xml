      today.. i went singing.. i learn that although my singing sux.. it doesn't really hurt to try.. and that real friends do not laugh at each other cruelly... today i also learn the meaning of true friendship.. although yk is always mistreated by his company of friends.. he tries his best to give in.. although his intentions are clear.. i feel sad as he is suffering silently.. hope that he will realise i have my ears always open to him.. i have learn alot from him.. regarding friendship.. i learn to give in from him, as he is always trying to give in.. although his company doesn't know how to appreciate him, and is always treating him unreasonably, saying that he ditch them.. but, he is a life to, and can't spend all his life with them.. however, they dun seem to understand it, but instead of blasting at them.. being a good friend, he takes their mockings silently.. this really grieves me as the others dunno how to understand his feelings.. sad.. but true.. all i can do is to lend him my ears... YK!!!! should u have anything to say.. feel free to find me... i'm always available.. God is there to.. juz pray.. sure u noe how to pray.. feel free to ask.. God is always there.. take care~

      today.. i learn how to create harmony in a family.. it will not b easy.. but it only requires 4 virtue..  firstly, righteousness.. meaning, being fair and just.. this is the very most impt. espect in harmony in a family...  secondly and thirdly, hee hee.. forgot liaoz..  lastly, endurance.. however, wat is endurance.. the chinese says to endure is to have a knife stabbed into ur chest, and u still endure.. the westerners have another meaning.. it means to hold back although u'll win if u were to fight.. a example of endurance was iven.. there were two dogs.. a small dog and a big dog.. the big dog was resting when the small dog started barking at the big dog.. the big dog juz ignored him.. the small dog went another step ahead, and bang into the big dog.. again, the big dog ignored.. the small dog, now thinking he is very great, went to bite the big dog.. this time, the big dog stood up, and the small dog ran back.. the big dog knew that even his barkings could send the dog flying.. so he lies back down to rest.. this is endurance..

      today.. while waiting for my gf to end her tuition with my mummy, i was with yk.. he told me tt there was this american lady asking him for 22 dollars claiming she needed to seek medical help, while showing him her bruise... this had sadden me truly.. not bcoz she was hurt.. but bcoz there were so many ppl, claiming they r in need, yet they r only out to con ur money... this really hurts me, as this ppl's irresponsible act may make ppl think that those in need r one of those that r there to cheat ppl's money.. yk also told me.. that there was this dumb man in plaza singapura askin ppl to buy his products to help him.. however yk saw him smoking.. i felt very cheated as i was one of those he had cheated.. but i guess it doesn't matter.. let his conscience haunt him.. so to all able bodies out there.. work hard.. do not cheat ppl.. there are those really in need.. ok.. gtg.. buhbye..

      today i was watching the show called honesty.. i guess it was suppose to b a comedy, however, with it lies many moral value.. mainly concerning honesty... from it, i learn tt honesty brings abt rewards tt r unknown.. also, i learn the power of true love, tt the girl do not mind risking the large sum of money for the guy she loved... hahahaah.. that's all abt the show.. nvm.. hmmm.. today we tricked my form teacher using some lame jokes.. but from it.. i learnt many lessons.. one of which is tt things may not always b as it seems.. sometimes, one has to see beyond the horizon.. another point is.. there isn't always a pattern to something, things may vary due to different effects.. ok.. gtg.. bye..

      today.. when i was at deb's house, i saw this channel news asia advertisement..it reminded me of this show i came acrossed many years ago.. the title was "pay it forward".. it is abt this group of students given an assignment to change the world.. and this boy came up with this theory.. then he, being the starting block, would do acts of kindness to 3 ppl.. this 3 ppl instead of repayin him, will each do an act of kindness to 3 other ppl and so on and so forth.. it was a really touching show.. but think abt it.. wouldn't the world b a better place if everyone was kind to each other?? that's wat the world is lacking now.. hoping for a better future~ bye
