       ADVANCED HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!   I'll be posting later my New Year's Resolutions. It wouldn't be a complete list though, because I would keep the really private stuff to myself(of course!).  We had lunch at Makisig a while ago. Venz and his sisters, along with their dad all went to Tikay, Bulacan to pay a visit to their Ina there.  I was able to talk with my dear best friend and destiny Angel.  It was fun since we hadn't been able to talk to one another for about 3 weeks.

        SUSTAINABLE HYGIENIC HABITS   I feel so disgusted of myself... I wouldn't want to elaborate why...you might just get eeked out.  I don't think I would be posting anything about the Sustainable Development and USA stuff. I'm just so tired of politics lately.  I need to pump up my health habits... I really do...

        BORED   I feel so bored... I think I have many other things to do, but I just don't feel like moving away in front of this monitor. I feel tired of doing the same things over and over again.  Currently listening to: Savage Garden's Break Me Shake Me  Here are some stuff that I wish I now have:  1. DVD Player / DVD-ROM 2. 17" CRT/LCD Monitor 3. Apple iPod kahit 10GB lng... 4. Apple Powerbook 5. Honda CRV A/T 6. Unlimited Internet Access 7. A 20/20 pair of eyes 8. A decent cable tv tuner for my PC 9. A more enthusiastic and inquisitive mind 10. A more decent face 11. Hardbound edition of The Alchemist 12. A more faithful spirit 13. A healthier body 14. Stronger connection with my friends 15. A box of Ferrero Rocher everytime I open the drawer next to me(hehe) =P 16. Webcam 17. An Athlon XP 3.0GHz processor with the Quiet AMD Fan and 18. a 80GB Hard Disk plus 19. 1024MB of Memory 20. A better knowledge in HTML and Java(yikes, excited na daw pumasok!)  I'm such an ambitious freak. I'm actually happy with what I have now...it's just that certain passions can never be satisfied.  Nung first time kong nakita yung Churce of Gesu, parang gusto ko nang magsimba dun palagi.  I'll try to include in my New Year's Resolutions the habit of partaking in the Holy Eucharist at least twice a week(siyempre yung every sunday).  Hindi pa rin kami nakakabili ng Webcam.  Now listening to: Nina's Loving You

         Malalaman mo Kaya? / Will You Ever Know?    Whew!!! This is like the most tiring holiday vacation I ever had!!! Not only that, it's also seems to be the most expensive(well,  for my auntie's part, since she's the one paying for the costs of the trips)!!!  We arrived from Villasis, Pangasinan at about 8:30 a.m.  I still haven't made my New Year's Resolutions... though I'm praying that next year would be a better year for all of us...   I'm planning to post something about Sustainable Development on my next post.  This topic has kept me thinking deeply these past few days.  Ahh...and also my view of the United States of America.  Here's the lyrics of my current favorite song:  You Don't Know My Name by Alicia Keys  Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you, I really, really wanted to catch your eye. There's something special 'bout you. I must really like you, 'cause not a lot of guys are worth my time. Oh. Baby, baby, baby, It's gettin' kinda crazy, 'cause you are takin' over my mind.   CHORUS: And it feels like OooOoOoOoOooOooOooo... You don't know my name. I swear... It feels like OooOoOoOoOooOooOooo... You don't know my name. ('Round and 'round and 'round we go. Will you ever know?)   Oh!  Baby, baby, baby I see us on our first date. You're doin' everything that makes me smile. And when we had our first kiss, it happened on a Thursday, and, ooh, it set my soul on fire. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I can't wait for the first time. My imagination's runnin' wild.   Chorus  I'm sayin' he don't even know what he's doin' to me. Got me feelin all crazy inside. Im feelin like...Oh!  I'm doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention. Take notice of what's in front of you 'cause did i mention (Oh!)  you're 'bout to miss a good thing? And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection. And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' (Oh!) 'Cause my lovin feels like...    Will you ever know it?  No, no, no, no, no...no, no... Will you ever know it?   (Spoken) Well I'm a have to just go head and call this boy. Hello? Can I speak to...to Michael? Oh, hey how you doin'? Uh, I feel kinda silly doin this but, uh,  this is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lenox. You know the one with the braids? Yeah. Well I see you on Wednesdays all the time. You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think. And you always order the special...with the hot chocolate. My manager be trippin and stuff talkin 'bout we gotta use water, but... I always use some milk and cream for you, cause... I think you're kinda sweet. (laughs) Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit  and your cufflinks is shining all bright. So what you do? Oh word? Yeah that's interestin'... Look man, I mean, I don't wanna waste your time but... I know girls don't usually do this, but I was wonderin' if maybe we could get together outside the restaurant one day? You know 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes and... I mean we could just go across the street to the park, right here... Wait, hold up, my... my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up... Can you hear me now? Yeah. So what day did you say? Oh yeah. Thursday's perfect, man.   CHORUS  Will you ever know?

        "Gustung-gusto nyong nakikisiksik, e alila naman ang turing sa atin! ... Putang ina!"   Kanina, after our visit to Angelo's house, we went back home and I prepared for a good-time with my cousins Venz, Za, Neng, Joy and Jil.  We decided to watch the movie Mano Po 2 at Robinson's MetroEast.  Unfortunately, when we arrived at the mall, we found out that we have come too late for the closest screening time.  So, we had a dilemme which MMFF entry we would watch.  At first, Venz went to the line for Captain BarBell.  While he was waiting for our turn to pay for the tickets, Jil and I went to see the schedules of the other movies. I told them that  we could watch Crying Ladies or Mano Po 2 at 6:30 P.M., which is also the end of screening time of Captain Barbell.  But then, the whole group suddenly went to the Filipinas line.  Their reason for doing this was that there was no one else lining up.  So, everyone just agreed to watch Filipinas.  Filipinas was a good movie although the storyline seems very familiar and the succeeding scenes are just too predictable.  At least, in my opinion, it was a far better movie than Intolerable Cruelty, which I and my Claret friends watched the other day in SM Megamall.  I found some points in the story that are interesting. The movie discussed some things about migration to the United States, the life in the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the breaking down of the traditional Filipino family.  Many Filipinos could relate to the some lines that were explicitly said in the movie.  My favorite lines from the movie are the following:  1. "Ang hirap na kasi ng buhay sa Pilipinas eh." 2. "Alam mo ba, ang Amerika ang pinakamalaking konsumer ng likas na yaman sa mundo?" 3. "At least, hindi ka na mag-aalala sa mga suicide bombings." 4. "...I think that the Americans are just smarter than us." 5. "Gustung-gusto nyong nakikisiksik, e alila naman ang turing sa atin! ... Putang ina!" 6. "Pa'no, ang iniisip ninyo kasi, lahat ng problema nalulutas ng Amerika!" ---  I found out that going out with my cousins is very fulfilling.  Parang pwede kong gawin kahit anong gusto ko kapag kasama sila.  The feeling of independence was there, since no adult supervision took place the whole time we were out.  Tapos, nung nasa car, we had a great time singing along with the songs being played by the radio stations.  Hindi nakakahiyang gawin kasi lahat kami kumakanta.  It was great to see and feel that we cousins have many similarities, especially in taste in music, though we also have many differences.  I have already prepared my things partially for our 4-day vacation in Villasis, Pangasinan, again with my relatives. Nakakapagod na!!! Wala atang araw na hindi ako lumabas ng bahay ah! Mula nung nag-boracay kami, dirediretso ata lahat ng paglabas sa bahay! But it's ok.  At least I'm learning many things from my experiences.

        ON COTTAGES AND MIGRATION   On our second day in Boracay, we decided to ride the banana boat.  The first batch includes me, Ate Tin, Neng, Zaza, Venz, Ate Ging, and Kuya Edric. At first, everyone was having fun.  Then the ride gradually picked up speed.  Sumisigaw na sina Neng na medyo bagalan daw.  Tapos, yun, after a few moments, tumaob na yung banana boat. Wahaha.  It was great! Nainom nga lang ako ng maraming maraming tubig.  As in. Sobrang alat pa. May pumasok pa sa ilong ko.  Pero nung nakasakay na ulit kme lahat sa boat, ayaw na nila ulit tumaob yung boat.  E di siyempre, anong magagawa ko, e majority wins, diba?  So yun, bumalik na kami sa shore for the second batch to have their rides.  And then, tuloy ang swimming.  Nasa second batch nga pala sina Ate Maria and Kuya John.  Pagbalik nila, kinuwento naman nila yung experience nila.  Sabi ni Kuya John naumpog daw sa tuhod niya yung isang Koreano *ouch* Hehe.  Tapos si Ate Maria naman may sinabi tungkol sa contact lenses niya.    Nung gabi na, ewan ko ba...na-depress na naman ako.  Ang nakakabwisit pa, habang nagso-stroll kami para maghanap ng kung saan magdi-dinner, may mga bata na nang-asar sa akin na ang haba daw ng baba ko.  E wala pa naman ako sa mood nun para makipagbiruan.  Buti na lang d ako gumalaw nung time na yun.  Tapos yun, dun kame sa may Mongolian Grill nag-dinner.  I also had the chance to have some talk with my second cousins from the United States.  OK sila. Ang babait.  Tapos, naki-inom din ako sa Bailey's ni Venz.  Na-alleviate yata yung depression ko dahil dun e.  Humingi din ako ng advice kay Suzanne through SMS kung anong pwedeng gawin kse I feel pathetic nung time na yun. So sabi nya mag-stroll na lang daw ako.  D ko nasunod yung advice nya kasi pagbalik namin sa cottages namin medyo ok na rin yung pakiramdam ko tsaka parang tinatamad na rin akong lumabas. Nagbasa na lang ulit ako ng the alchemist.  Nung third day na, late na akong nagising ate pinatunayan ito ng isang batch ng pictures na ako lang ang kulang.  Aarrgh!!! Kayo talaga!  No on cares for me!!! Huhu... ='( Haha!!! Anyway, ok lang sakin yun.  Nagswim ako ng onti then I decided to go strolling and look for pasalubongs for my friends.  Then we had our lunch and went on to exploring the different beaches of the island.  Masyadong marami ang nakita ko...tinatamad na akong magdetail-out...^_^  We had our dinner at TongYang, which was just near our cottages.  Then after eating, I decided to stroll again, this time with Venz.  He was also looking for pasalubongs.  Upon returning to our cottages, I decided that I should start packing up my things so I won't have a hard time the next day.  So nung Monday na, all my things are already prepared.  Nag-last minute shopping pa ang mga bruno't bruna.  Ahaha! Ang nabili ko lang naman sa last minute shopping na yun e yung keychains para sa Claret friends ko.  Pero ok pa rin.  We had our breakfast at the restaurant near one of the shopping centers.  In fairness, ang tagal naming naghintay ng bangka papuntang Caticlan Airport.  Pero ok lang.  Nung nasa airport na kami, kung anu-ano pang bagay ang pinag-iisip ko.  Pero ang pinaka-dominant sa utak ko nun e yung tanong na 'may pag-asa pa ba ang Pilipinas?' Medyo matagal ko nang pinag-iisipan 'to e.  Pero wala pa rin akong makitang sagot na nakakasatisfy sa aking doubts.  May mga naririnig pa ako dati na pag nanalo si FPJ, magma-migrate na sila sa ibang bansa, more specifically to the United States of America.  Ewan.  Ang akin naman, ano namang mapapala nila sa pagma-migrate nila?  Well yes, siguro nga their level of living would be so much better, pero ano namang naitulong nila para makatulong sa RP? Wala na nga bang nagmamahal sa Inang Bayan?  Haay...wala lang...deep thoughts.

        The Alchemy of Computer Science Part I   *I’ve decided that from this post onwards, I would be using both the Filipino and English language since it would be easier for me to express what I would really like to say.  Also, it would be more fun for my friends to read my posts since I would be able to use words and phrases that are more appropriate for certain situations…*  We have arrived from the airport at around 5 p.m.  The whole trip was really tiring… *sigh*  But at least I can say that it was really sulit.  Hehe. =P   During our first day in Boracay, I saw many stuff that amazed me.  Nag-swimming na nga kami agad kahit yung iba pa naming kasama ay natutulog pa. Well I guess that’s just fine kse napagod nga naman sila sa biyahe.  Oh, I forgot to introduce them.  They are Auntie Jane, Kuya Angelito, and Kuya John and Ate Maria.  They came all the way from the US.  Ang alam ko kase, Kuya John and Ate Maria were just married and decided to have some vacation here in the Philippines, where their original families once lived. Kuya Angelito and Kuya John are our cousins.  Tapos yun, ang lamig lamig ng tubig!!! E wala pa naming araw nung time na iyon…pero ok lng…I still had fun kasi I went swimming with my other cousins.  Kasama nga rin pala namin si Kuya Edric, Ate Ging’s boyfriend.  After swimming, we went back to our cottages and ate our merienda.  Siguro dahil dun sa merienda na un e hindi na ako nagutom pa ulit.  So, hindi na kami nagdinner kse sila din busog.  Nung gabi na…ewan ko ba…I felt so empty and lonely(yikes!).  Wala kse akong makausap, pano ba naman, etong si Venz(pinsan ko rin) e natulog habang nakikinig sa kanyang I-POD.  Haay, buhay… kaya ang ginawa ko e tinext ko sina Suzanne and Angel para naman medyo mabawasan ang pagkabato ko.  Tpos, naisipan ko na ring basahin ulit yung The Alchemist.  Dahil dun…napaisip tuloy ako at gumawa ng instant blog sa notes ng aking handphone:  /**I think that I am in the right path towards achieving my personal legend.  Kanina, pinag-iisipan ko pa kung tama nga ban a kinuha ko ang computer science as my course in college…kse nung bata pa ako gusto ko talagang maging doctor.  Pero nung mga grade 5 – grade 6 na, mas na-intensify ung interest ko sa computers lalo na sa html tsaka web designing.  I even won awards in some related contests.  Tapos from then on, nakalimutan ko na ata ang aking ‘medicine dream’. Pero I think, kaya lang ako nagkakaganito ngayon ay dahil may doubt pa rin ako sa sarili ko kung kaya ko nga bang malampasan ang compsci.  Well… siguro nga totoo yung beginner’s luck or law of favorability o kung ano pa mang tawag dun.  Hehe…  pera ba’t ganun, uno nga ako sa cs11, pero kita nyo naman ngayon, nagma-Math17 ulit ako!!! Bakit kaya?  Siguro kase may problema lang talaga ako sa study habits ko sa Math.  Kaya nga eto ngayon second sem e todo pagsisipag ang ginagawa ko kase ayaw ko na atang maulit yung nangyari sakin nung first sem…haay…*/  This post has already become too long!!! I’ll just continue my other Boracay stories on my next posts. =)

         PARTIES AND ORGS   Last night(which was three hours ago), we had a 'Christmas Party' at our cousins' home in Makisig Street.  It wasn't really much of a party, as we started it off by having a well-prepared dinner, then goes the socials.  The RD boys with their families are also there, of course, because the party was held for RD Designs(the company where my mom is working).  I also had some chitchat with Venz, my only male cousin here in the Philippines(father's side).  It's great because we had some talk about the orgs that we are planning to join in.  I told him that I'm planning to apply for the UP Junior Marketing Association(UP JMA), and learned that he, too, was also also planning to do so.  Sorry, not planning. He has  already  completed the application form!!! Well, good for him.  I still haven't made up my mind on joining this org.

        Frustrations and Anticipations   I had a  REALLY  good time a while ago with old friends and new friends at Jez' 18th birthday bash.  I had been able to  rebond  with Curie I funky buddies Harvy, Marves, Kamille, Manilyn and Jane.  Also, I had a great time conversing with JC, Adrian, Brent, Maan, Rovan, Viel, Dennis, and Leah...  I forgot to mention in my previous blog that the test item that I hadn't been able to answer was the type of problem that I wasn't expecting to give me a hard time...it was a counting problem(Venn Diagram).  Anyway, I'm feeling much better now that I'm already excited for the upcoming Christmas vacation with the start of the Oblation Run, Lantern Parade and our trip to Boracay.    Enjoy the holidays, everyone! =P

       I've just finished the exam!!! I feel bad awhile ago because I wasn't able to answer a 6-points item!!! Aaarrgh!!!  Which means...i could only have a maximum of 44 points...and I'm not even sure if my other answers are correct...   I hope that I would learn more about HTML making so that I can already start modifying this page and my 'personal website''(it sucks).

       I've just found out that the  JavaScript for Dummies  which I borrowed isn't really the book that I needed...what I really need is the  HTML for Dummies  book. Oh well...I've already downloaded an e-book of HTML tutorial and I'm hoping that this could help me. I'd be taking my test later in Math17.  Wish me luck!!!

       I've just done something bad.  As in REALLY BAD.  I'm starting to get scared because the last time I did something bad, it became a habit.  A naughty evil habit.  A time-consuming, unproductive habit.  And i'm getting really afraid now of the consequences.   Okay...I'd promise to myself that I won't do it again. I will not do that again.  I will not do THAT KIND OF THING AGAIN.    But still, this promise is dangerously breakable.  You know the feeling that something is not good but you keep on doing it because it FEELS good?  Uh oh.  I'm really a BAD person.  BAAAD!!!

       I went to see the Last Samurai at Robinson's Metroeast with my friends Justin and  urlLink Lex . It was a really great movie! Buti na lang di nasayang ang panonood namin ng last full show.  Late na kami nanood kasi hindi sila available nung afternoon.  Kaya 7 pm na kami nakarating sa MetroEast.   urlLink     Natutuwa ako sa movie kasi medyo anti-imperialism siya.  Tsaka yung effects, props, costumes, etc., ayos talaga ang pagkakagawa.  Magaling talaga.  I found it more interesting than the Lord of the Rings.  Kaya lang, kung iisipin, hindi naman talaga pwedeng i-compare kasi fantasy yung LOTR while this one is not.  Ok talaga yung production! Tapos yung village, sobrang ganda ng setting.  Iniisip ko sana nabuhay na lang ako nung time na 'yon para nagkaroon ako ng chance tumira sa mga Samurai villages.  Matindi ang landscaping.  Astig talaga.  Siguro ito 'yung isa sa mga movie na nadala talaga yung emotions ko dahil sa sobrang galit ko sa mga American imperialists.  Buti naman at may ganitong movie.  Naisip ko rin kanina na hindi nag-stop ang imperialism ng America up to this day.    Lex is so keen with his sight.  Siya yung nakakita sa isang celebrity, a gay couple, and even presidential-aspirant Raul Roco outside the movie house.  Nakakatawa, andami niyang nakitang kakaiba.

       Nakakalungkot. Wala lang. Feel ko lang magdrama.  Nakakamiss na ang high school friends ko.  Naramdaman nyo na ba dati yung feeling na "Ang saya-saya ko!  Nothing can make me feel down from now on!"?  E yung feeling na bored to death ka na at wala kang magawa at naisip mo yung old friends mo?  Wala lang.  Kse may times na parang contented na ako sa status ko. Na since college na ako, i now have many choices and opportunities.  Na hindi ko na mararamdaman ang boredom dahil sa dami ng gawain.  That I can find satisfaction without other people's company.  Mali pala ako. Namimiss ko na pala ang high school friends ko.  Hindi talaga sila maikukumpara sa mga nakilala sa college.    ---  "Bakit ba sumikat ang mga blog?" Ito ay tinanong sa akin ng isa sa aking mga kaibigan.  Sabi ko, "Para magpapansin ang mga tao", without thinking about what I've just said.  Anyway, hindi naman siguro negative ang dating 'nun dba?  It's just natural for human beings to find ways to express their feelings. And blogging is a good one, I think.    ---  Nakapag-pass ako kanina ng ME(Machine Exercise), pero sobrang late na.

       Nakakabuwisit talaga siya. Panira ng araw.  B***sh&t.  Ang kapal talaga ng mukha.  Kung pwede nga lang, d ko na lang siya _ _ _ _ _.  Ang kapal kse eh.  Ayaw pang ihatid si _ _ _ _ dahil sa kung anong stupid reason.  Stupid.  Yes. That's the right word.  He's really stupid, dumb, nonsense, brainless.  Naku! Sana hindi na lng siya bumalik dito. Ba't ba kasi namin pinilit!? Para kay _ _ _ _? Ewan.  Pero basta. Siya ay isang insensitive, annoying, nincompoop na hindi ko alam kung bakit ko siya kadugo. Panira talaga.  I've tried understanding him but it's just plain useless! All my efforts are wasted.  Well, in the first place, he should be the one to understand  us .  Siya yung umalis e.   Haay, buhay.  I'm really not in the mood to celebrate the end of this week.  Sana, by some miracle, magbago na  siya . Good Lord, hear my prayer!

       Yey! The Math17 midterm exam is finally over...at last.  I can at least breathe a bit easier now.  By the time I got home, I released my stress by watching anime from 6 til 10 pm! BTW. I had 2 exams for today, a long exam in NatSciI, and the midterm exam.  I also got the chance to watch Chobits! Unfortunately, I didn't watch it yesterday night because I was preparing for the exams. For the exam, I mean.  I wasn't really able to study for the NatSci test because I was focusing my brain for the Math test.    Well, that's it.  The exams for this week is over, which means, I could watch Animax every night...well, that is, until the next set of exams come.  Haay...this week(although it's not yet over) is one of the hardest weeks for this semester.  May midterms ba naman e.   More stuff are coming up, though...like the MP1 deadline which would be 2 weeks from now, and some other requirements.   Nakakainis!  I was not allowed to bring the car tomorrow because they would be using it.  Aarrgghh.  I'm suppossed to bring it every Thursday because of the coding scheme.  Well... ok lang , I would be using it on Saturday with my friends because I would accompany Alexa in Rockwell for the party she's going to attend.  Today's episode of Chobits was really cute! I'm planning to sign up for a fan list. XD

       Last Saturday, I was able to watch three plays in Ateneo with two of my closest friends, Justin and Wendell.  We were lucky that we were invited by our friend Lex to watch 'Bahay-Bahayan'. BTW, Lex is from Ateneo.  He's a part of the Entablado.  All of the plays were great, and had wide-ranging themes and topics.  The performers carried out their actions and words well.   Last week(if i'm not mistaken), the ACET results were released.  Both Wendell and Justin passed it and also got their first choice courses.  Definitely, I was glad for them.  But then, Wendell told me that he wouldn't be going to UP anymore because his parents want him to be in Ateneo, and also, he already assumes that he won't pass the UPCAT.  I disagreed with him, saying that the ACET was a lot harder compared to the UPCAT.  Then he told me that (he learned from a very reliable source) only 3 students from their batch passed the UPCAT.  Again I argued that even if only 3 passed from the UPCAT, that doesn't mean that he didn't pass it.  Well...maybe I just want him to be my schoolmate.  Justin on the other hand, definetely wants to go to UP.  I'm praying that he would also pass the entrance test so that both of us would be in Diliman.    Sana lahat na lang kami sa Diliman...  Or the other scenario could also happen: lahat sila sa Ateneo.  Iniwan niyo ako!!!

       I just got an IQ test from emode, thanks to the friendster bulletin. It's funny that it told me that i'm a  visual mathematician  when I don't really see myself in a good light when it comes to mathematics. I guess the whole test was just a big joke. Oh, and the average IQ pala is 100 . Ngayon ko lang nalaman. It's from  urlLink mensa.

       Aha! I passed my CS12 First Long Exam by 4 points! Hehe... I received the results last week but I just want to put it here! Hehe...I guess I'm blessed to have passed my first three exams.   I was also able to transfer the pictures from my cousin's laptop to a CD-RW.   Little achievements... It's just weird that I get to do or achieve some things that I have posted in this blog.   Like buying the webcam, the CD-RW, posting my pet's pics... Baka nga totoo yung sinasabi dati sa leadership seminar...and that's good news for me. Sana mabili ko rin yung mga stuff na gusto ko!!! Alam ko na hindi ko yun makukuha nang sabay-sabay, siguro gradually.  Baka depende din sa timing. Or practicability. Or kung ano yung priorities ko.  Hmm... Basta, I'll just do my best... =)

       Ang lungkot...katatapos ko lang panoorin nung last episode ng New Non-Stop.  Bakit ba naman kse kelangan pang i-stop ung pag-e-air ng show? E, sa tingin ko e marami namang tao ang may gusto dun sa show.  Sayang talaga...nanghihinayang pa tuloy ako ngayon kase yung 2 episodes bago nitong last hindi ko napanood.  I had the oppurtunity to talk with Camyl kaninang mga 9pm.  Naging classmate ko siya nung first year high school.  Pero naging close kami. Nakakatuwa nga at may time pa rin kami kahit papaano na mag-usap, kahit hindi na kami nagkikita, at hindi na kami schoolmates.  Masarap talaga ang pakiramdam kapag nakaka-usap ang old friends.  Parang di pa rin nawawala yung dati nyong samahan.  Napapa-isip tuloy ako tungkol sa oras.  Ang bilis talaga ng panahon, 'no?  Parang split-second lang, ayun, nasa future ka na agad.  Tsaka mo lang maiisip yung nagdaang panahon...

       Ngayon lang ako medyo nakapag-isip-isip...tungkol sa sarili ko at ng buhay ko sa UP.  Medyo marami na ang nagbago sa'kin mula nang tumapak ako sa UP Diliman.  Dati, mas childish pa ako, carefree, tsaka kinakabahan palagi, at marami pang ibang bagay na para sa akin e pwede nating tawagin na immature traits.  Yun e nung first sem.  Hindi pa ako nag-coconcentrate sa pag-aaral sa math, walang study habits, feeling confident ako na makakapasa kahit papaano sa mga exam.  Pero mula nang nag-drop ako sa Math17...parang biglang nagbago view ko sa sarili at sa mundo.  At parang naihalintulad ko na ang buhay kolehiyo sa isang mahabang labanan.  Siguro paunti-unti lang yung shock sa akin dati.  Depression paminsan-minsan.  Minsan nagmamaktol sa isang tabi.  Minsan naman parang manhid na ako.   Tapos, parang bigla na lang akong humarap sa reality na ganito:  Hoy Adrian, ang tanga tanga mo! Nakapasok ka nga sa UP, pero tingnan mo, pinabayaan mo lang yang math mo! Naku, ikaw talaga! Sumali-sali ka pa diyan sa org na yan na feeling mo naman e makakapasok ka! Magbago ka na nga!   Haay, buhay...ang hirap nga naman talaga oh.  Akala ko dati, once na makapasok ako sa UP, magiging ok na ang lahat.  Hindi pala.  Dapat nakinig ako sa mga babala nila:  na kung mahirap makapasok sa Unibersidad, mas lalo namang mahirap makalabas dito .  Kaya ito, todo ang pagbibigay atensiyon ko sa math.  Alam kong hindi ako likas na magaling sa asignaturang ito ngunit sinisikap ko pa ring itulak ang sarili ko na pag-igihin ang pag-aaral dahil importante ito hindi lamang para sa kurso kong kinuha, kundi pati na rin sa magiging trabaho ko. Kailangan competitive e.  Hindi porket nasa UP, madali ka nang makakakuha ng trabaho.  Ngayon, makikinig na ako sa payo ng iba.    Minsan, napapaisip ako at dumadating sa punto na gusto ko nang sumuko. Na pagod na ako. Ayaw ko nang lumaban.  Pero, bunsod ng mga pangyayari sa akin noong first sem, maraming self-realizations ang nakamtan ko.  Una, na ang mga problema ay hindi binibigay ng Diyos kung ito'y hindi malalampasan.  Pangalawa, na ang mga problemang ito ay hindi dapat tingnan bilang mga pabigat kundi bilang mga pagsubok sa ating kakayahan na bumangon mula sa pagkalugmok.  Ito ay dapat nating tanggapin ng buo sapagkat ang lahat ng pagsubok ay may angkop na resultang maaring makapagbago sa atin.  At tayo na ang bahala kung ang pagbabagong ito ba ay makakasama o makakabuti sa atin.  Pangatlo, hindi natin dapat sisihin sa kung anu-ano o sa kung sinu-sino ang dahilan ng ating mga krisis,  dahil sa una pa lang, sa atin naman nakasalalay ang solusyon o paglala ng mga problemang ito - at wala nang iba.  Pangatlo, na ang study habits ay tunay na mahalaga sa pag-aaral.  Pang-apat, hindi dapat sayangin ang oras para sa mga walang kwentang bagay. At marami pang iba...Ang mga ito ang magiging gabay ko sa aking pag-aaral.    Hindi ko naman sinasabi na dapat e maging lugmok na tayo sa pag-aaral.  Importante din na magkaroon tayo ng oras para sa ating mga sarili, mga kaibigan at sa pamilya.  Ang akin lang, dapat ay marunong tayong magbalanse ng mga bagay-bagay.  Hindi lang ng mga gawaing pampaaralan, kundi pati na rin ng iba't ibang aspeto na bumubuo sa ating buhay.  Pangarap kong makapagtapos ng pag-aaral nang nasa oras.  Iyon bang sa Marso 2007 e maaari ko nang matanggap ang aking diploma nang sa gayon ay agad akong makapag-hanap ng trabaho at makatulong sa pamilya.  Marami-rami na rin ang nagbago sa akin.  At sigurado akong mas lalo pa akong magbabago sa pag-usad ng panahon.  Sana naman ang mga pagbabagong ito ay makabuti sa akin.  At sana din ay marami pa akong matutunan - kahit sa pamamagitan ng masasakit na karanasan...kung kinakailangan.   Umpisa pa lang pala ng laban.

       The following post was supposed to have been posted yesterday. Unfortunately, the time left in my internet card ran out. I was able to buy one a while ago, so here it is:  Ngayon ko lang na-download yung  Tara Tena  ni Kyla & Kaya with V3. Ang ganda ng kanta! Ok na ok sa akin ang message nito. Ngayon ko lang ulit naisip na may chance pa na maging progressive ang Pinas. Hehe...   Tara, simulan mo na   Tena, bagong pag-asa   Tara, tena   O, Kabataan ang galing naman   Simulan ang pagbabago sa bayan   Tara, tena   Tara, wag kakaba-kaba   Tena, oo may laban ka   Galingag, sipagan, pag-husayan    Panawagan: Kabataan, tara tena!   Well...what can I say? I'm really inspired by this song!

       Thank God, I got a passing grade for my first long exam in math! Well, it's a bit of an achievement for me, since I'm not really the kind of person who passes in math tests. And I got a 70/100 score for my first long exam in natsci I.  This year did start out good for me!   When I arrived from a school at about 3:30 p.m., I got the chance to watch National Geographic. The show was about the captive breeding of giant panda bears.  They're so cute!       I got touched at the part when the baby pandas were being brought out of their cages, while their mom was eating a cookie.  It's really a sad scene for me, because just before the baby pandas were about to be brought out, their mom was cuddling and playing with them. Then, moments later, they were unaware that those would be the last moments they would spend with their mama panda...oh...it's so sad.  I would be posting more pictures next time as I would have more time to take snapshots of Waffle and T-rex. Also, I would be buying a CD-RW at SC tomorrow so that I woud be able to get the image files from my cousin's laptop. It's too advanced that it doesn't have a floppy disk drive! Hehe...

        CHANGES  -->2004 It's funny that just a few hours ago, it seems like the Philippines had just won a major victory in a war.  Everyone was in a daze.  But at this moment...the atmosphere suddenly returns to its normal state...the fireworks stop, the loud music was reduced to nothing.  The TV channel was switched from the countdown by GMA to Star Movies, where Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is being aired.   I admit that I found this New Year's celebration better than the past years.  Well, I guess that's a personal view.  But then again, I'm hoping and praying that this whole huge celebration would signal a resounding change in the history of the Philippines and the whole world.  A change for the better - to be more specific.  I personally believe that everyone here in our country is tired of all the sad things that are constantly happening...things that have allowed our Asian neighbors label our country as 'The Sick Man of Asia'. I just hope that people would do the right thing in the coming elections...they shouldn't give in to the popularity contest being staged by the politicians.  They should vote for the candidates who are really willing to serve the people and act as piooners of change.  For my part...I discovered that I'm too skinny!  I saw myself in the video taken by my dad while we were celebrating the New Year...and I also seem very effeminate...hehe.  Maybe it's time to change some very physical and behavioral stuff about myself.  It would require a great effort though, specially when the one you're trying to change is your own self.   I'm hoping that this year, many things will change for the better...   Mabuhay ang pag-asa ng bayan...

       /**On Enviousness and Being Pathetic*/ My good friend, Wendell, has just obtained an 02 XDAII.  It's a smart phone.  It has all the great features that I want in a device.  And I'm now green with envy! Hehe... He, together with Justin, would be going to ADMU next school year.  What greater way can you start your college life than having a gadget that would make everyone around you turn their heads every time you pass by?  Haay, how I wish we're as rich as his family is.  I don't even have a laptop, which I think is a necessary equipment for my studies, considering my course!  Waah...rants rants. It's already the end of Feb and I still don't know how to actually use the Photoshop.  I'm such a pathetic creature!    /**Politics(na naman?!?)*/ I've just realized that Incubus' latest single is an anti-Bush and anti-terrorism song...and I like it.  Bush is going to have a major humiliating performance at the US November elections, and I'm quite sure of this considering he lied to the American people about the Iraq invasion.  Okay, okay, Justin, for our peace of mind, I'll stop defending Roco.  But that doesn't mean that I'm going support GMA. NEVER! I'll go for anyone except GMA, FPJ, Lacson, or Gil. Hehe. So that leaves Roco and Bro. Eddie(yes, I know now, you're wondering:"What the !@#$? Bro. Eddie?!?"), 'no?  /**Guitar Lessons*/ I'm planning to take guitar lessons this summer vacation.  Parang ang saya kse panoorin nung mga taong marunong mag-gitara.  Ano kayang feeling pag ako na mismo yung nag-gigitara?  /**Exams, exams, and more exams*/ Yipee! The sem is about to end(and the academic year, in fact)!  And this means many exams are going to kill me as the end of the sem draws nearer! Yipee! *sarcastic*  It's been a long time since I posted lyrics... Lyrics of the moment:  Artist: July For Kings  Song: New Black Car   Waiting tables at your restaurant job an old man reads the paper in the booth where I stop to say hello when I'm in town to ask a friend if you're around.  And I think about those summer nights we never slept we didn't mind and I felt so alive and happy just sitting on the porch and swinging back and forth  now everything seems so distant  But I promise I'm not too far when you're alone in your brand new car driving your new black car into the rain  Are you listening to the radio are you driving down a city road are you alone in your new black car I imagine you there.  I'm sitting by the window here the morning birds will reappear  and I feel empty...  our songs are on the radio you call me up but I have to go  and I'm sorry, angel. I'm sorry.  but I'll call you right back I swear. you think I've left you there alone with an empty chair but I whisper your name  Are you listening to the radio are you driving down a city road are you alone in your new black car I imagine you there. are you listening to the radio are you driving down a city road are you alone in your new black car the wind in your hair  Are you tired of watching the rain hit the glass all alone but aware of the places we've passed together we were singing along to the songs are you now? are you now? I'm thinking of you in your college town are you thinking of me as you're driving around are you listening to me? are you listening?  Are you listening to the radio are you driving down a city road are you alone in your new black car I imagine you there. are you listening to the radio are you driving down a winding road are you alone in your new black car the wind in your hair alone in your new black car I imagine you there driving your new black car the wind in your hair  Are you listening to the radio? are you listening to the radio? are you listening to the radio? are you listening to the radio?

       This day proved to be a very tiring one.  I didn't really expect this day to one full of surprises.  Well, not really surprises but there's just some parts of this day which I didn't really expect to happen.    I woke up really early at around 7am.  I was still arguing with myself if I should or should not go to the General Assembly of our org(SUMS+UP).  I finally decided that I should just stay home because I was thinking that if I would be attending, I won't really have anyone to talk to because Marinel wasn't allowed to go. Knowing that I have this tendency to be reserved when I don't know anyone around me, I just rejected the thought of socializing with the other members, therefore making me really decide to just stay home and relax...it's a weekend anyway.  Before I went to the bathroom to do some morning rituals, I checked my phone if anyone gives a damn about me.  And, surprise surprise, Lex texted me and reminded me that he(together with Justin and Wendell) would be coming over in the afternoon.  I ate my breakfast, read the newspaper, and went upstairs, back to my room.  As usual, my Internet addiction got over me and if I'm not mistaken, I was online for 4 hours or so.  Considering I was only using a dial-up connection and we only have 1 phoneline in this house, that is quite long.   By around 1 pm, I was chatting with maitha over ym.  We talked about the UPCAT results...which disappointed both of us because we expected some people to pass it.  For my part, I was a bit depressed because 2 of my bestfriends did not pass and so did my cousin.  When Lex arrived here at 3 pm, I started reading his Chobits manga, which he bought for P600.  He's got money for manga and anime stuff, which makes me green with envy sometimes ^^; While we were waiting for Justin, he listened to Maitha's CDs which contained tracks from popular animes.  He liked listening to them, I think. Then we heard someone knock on the door.  It was Justin.  We immediately downloaded the stuff the he needs for school(talaga lang...bakit yun pa...? hehe). We ate merienda at Jollibee Express just at the end of our street.    While eating, J and I started debating about who's more fit to win this upcoming elections.  He defended that GMA is the best choice for president while I argued that Roco would be the most fit for that position.  We argued all the way back home, and just ended when we realized that we can't convince each other on who indeed is the better choice.  I felt really tired after that looooooooooooong debate.  Anyway, I would not like to go into the details of that fiery debate.  By the way, while we were debating, I reminded him that what we were doing was just an exchange of ideas, nothing personal.  I could see that both of our emotions are already burning with passion while we were arguing.  Good thing something or Someone reminded me that this talk shouldn't be in any way be brought to a personal level.  Later that evening, we were lucky to chance seeing Ate Ayee and family online over the MSN messenger.  Jil, Tita Vi, Ma and Pa chatted with them while the three of us friends were eating dinner.  After dinner, we finished the stuff that we were able to finish for Justin's 'project'. Lex left around 9:30 pm, and Justin 10 pm.   *Yawn* I'm so sleepy now that I dont' think I can finish this entry properly.  Anyway, congrats to all the UPCAT passers.    I'd like to sleep now!!!  ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz..................

       /**Academics*/ Haay, ang weird...ang baba ng mga nakuha kong exam grades(pero pasado!) sa CS12 and Kas1, pero mataas sa math...ang weird talaga! 68% sa Kas! Yun yung d ko matanggap e! Kasaysayan lang yun e(or so I thought)! Well, ako rin naman ang may kasalanan, pa'no, nung gabi lang before nung exam ako nag-aral.  Haha... well, I guess I deserve the grades that I got.     Buti na lang pasado ako sa long exam sa CS...as in eksakto yung score para pumasa. Wahaha...ayan nanaman e...kse nung gabi lang before nung exam ulit ako nag-aral.  Naku, kelangan ko na talagang magsipag kse yung class standing ko ay hindi masyadong matino(para sa'kin).  Binigay din ngayon yung specs for the second Machine Problem...and game ulit siya. AlphaNum Invasion ata ang title ng program kung hindi ako nagkakamali.  Groupmates ko sina Charm at Liz! Buti na lang groupwork 'to.  Nakakatawa kse nakasama pa ako dun sa top 10 sa third long exam sa math17...e di ko naman ine-expect yun.  Ang bait talaga ni sir gibey sa grades!!! Sana magturo siya sa summer ng 53!!! Tsaka 54 sa next sem...     /**Pagkain*/ Natikman ko kanina ang highly recommended juice ni  urlLink maitha  na halo-halo juice.  At kanina ko lang din na-discover na meron palang juice na halo-halo juice. Haha.    Isa pang na-realize ko ay...mas masarap pa lang kumain pag hindi ako dito sa bahay kumakain.  Ewan ko kung bakit, pero parang mas masarap ang kain ko kapag nasa ibang bahay. Ang weird ko talaga...tulad ngayon...wala akong ganang kumain dito sa bahay ngayon.  Pero siguro kung nasa bahay ako ngayon ng pinsan ko e ire-raid ko ang kusina at ref nila.   /**J-POP*/ Naku...naa-addict na ako sa Do As Infinity at kay Utada Hikaru! Si  urlLink maitha  ulit ang may sala! Pinahiram niya pa ako ng maraming CD na puro J-Pop! Pero...sige lang impluwensiyahan niyo pa ako! Kung may alam kayong ibang artist na ok din ang music, paki-iwan na lang po ang pangalan nila sa comments section sa ibaba. ^_^  /**Janet's B**bs*/ Aba...totoo pa lang pinakita sa Super Bowl ito...at grabe...inexpose niya ba talaga intentionally? Ewan...  /**May Org na ako!!!*/ Hehe, member na po ako ng SUMS-UP(Society of University Math Students - University of the Philippines)! Wala lang! Ang saya kase masaya sa tambayan... Gusto ko rin sumali sa UPJMA next sem...

       This is not supposed to be the entry posted here now.  I was typing my supposed entry just a while ago when suddenly, I heard something pop inside the computer's casing then the PC went off.    Whew.  Just when I thought that my PC has left me all alone...my dad bought a new power supply system that revived my beloved computer. *Sigh of relief*...  so...I'll just be blogging later the stuff that I should have already posted here.  Hehe...

       Haha...we went to our cousins' house a while ago to have some fun.  We had spaghetti, toasted bread and some chicken for merienda, courtesy of our very talented chef/cousin, Jil.  After the merienda, we decided to watch  Freaky Friday  on DVD.  LOL.  It was a really fun movie to watch.  I recommend watching this film if you feel like you need to laugh and relax.  Hehe.  Haay...some updates about this blog.  Since I still don't have an Adobe Photoshop, I decided to...well, just stick to this blog.  Thanks to Haloscan for the commenting system.

       At last...this hell week has finally come to an end.  I have just finished the 3rd long exam in math about 3 hours ago.  Whoa.  Finally, I can put my mind to rest again.  Punta kaya ako sa fair mamaya..? May concerts ulit kasi... and i just want to enjoy this weekend.  Sabi nung classmate ko sa math may nagsaksakan daw kagabi. Weird. Pati ba naman sa mga concert may nagsasaksakan.  Haay, buhay nga naman o. Hehe.    Kainis! It's already mid-feb and i still don't have a photoshop software! aarrggh! Haay...kelan pa kaya ako makakabili..?

       /** Fairster */  Last night, the bands that we saw were good.  One of the exceptional bands that I have noticed is Silent Sanctuary. They have 2 members who play the violin and 1 who plays the cello, but their music can still be considered as rock.  They performed really good songs. I'm actually planning to buy their album if I have time.  I wasn't able to see Parokya ni Edgar because I left the Sunken Garden before 12 midnight.  I was worried that I might have a hard time waking up, specially that my first class starts at 7 am.  It's still ok with me, since I was still able to see really good bands like Stonefree and 6 Cycle Mind.  When I got home, I finished a paper for English and solved a proving problem for Math.  I slept feeling really tired.  /** Internet Cards */  Bakit ba ang mahal ng DSL? Nakakinis...ti-nayp ko lang muna 'tong entry na 'to sa notepad kse d ako makapag-blog since wala ngang prepaid net card!!! Waah!!! Kahit unlimited dial-up lang, masaya na 'ko!  /** Long Exams */  I am going to take the 2nd Long Exam for CS12 tomorrow at MJEC.  The 3rd LE for Math17 would be on Valentine's Day, the 14th. I just hate it when exams are taken during the weekends.  //this entry was suppossed to be posted last February 12.

       Nakakatuwa talaga yung Chobits.  Parang napaka-posibleng mangyari satin in the near future yung nangyari sa Chobits.  E d ba, yung AIBO nga parang may mga functions ni Sumomo tsaka nung iba pang small-sized Persocoms?  Well, ibig sabihin lang nito ay hindi imposibleng makagawa yung scientists ng mga mala-Persocom na robots dala ng advancement ng knowledge sa Artificial Intelligence.  Hehe...sana kung may mga Persocom na, magkaroon ako ng isa para mapag-aralan ko rin! Kung posible gusto ko ring gumawa ng programs para sa Artificially Intelligent Beings.  Parang ang saya kase pwede mong ipagawa kahit anong gusto mo.  Kaya nga lang, maraming mga d kanais-nais na effects tulad na lamang ng nangyari sa asawa ni Miss Shimizu.  Haay...sobrang posible talaga na mangyari din sa mankind yung nangyari sa time setting ng Chobits.  Marami akong nakikitang theme sa Chobits...may tungkol sa human psychology, merong tungkol sa society's general preferences, may tungkol sa individual choices, family matters, at iba pa.  OK talaga 'tong anime series na 'to. Sabi nga nung friend ko, dark ang story ng Chobits.  It may seem light on the superficial side, pero kung susuriin talaga, malalim tsaka may relevance yung story.  Siguro mahilig lang talaga ako sa 'mabibigat' and dark na series.

         You are Form 3,  Unicorn : The Innocent.   "And The Unicorn knew she wasn't meant to go into the Dark Wood.  Disregarding the advice given to her by the spirits, Unicorn went inside and bled silver blood..  For her misdeed, the world knew evil."   Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve (Christian) and Pandora (Greek). The Unicorn is associated with the concept of innocence, the number 3, and the element of water. Her sign is the twilight sun.  As a member of Form 3, you are a curious individual.  You are drawn to new things and become fascinated with ideas you've never come in contact with before.  Some people may say you are too nosey, but it's only because you like getting to the bottom of things and solving them.  Unicorns are the best friends to have because they are inquisitive.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Haha.  Just as we thought that our burdens are now lighter...we found out that there are still some bugs on our program!!!  Aargghh.    Anyway...I wouldn't like to blog about that annoying game.  Yesterday, the  urlLink PDI  had a very interesting frontpage headline.  It was about Roco giving way in order to make GMA win the fight against FPJ. The said statement was made by some analysts.  Well, all I can say is...what the f*c%!? That's such a pathetic logical argument! I suggest that you just read today's opinion column of Mr. Conrado de Quiros. It's about the analysts' lack of logic.  It's not that I'm pro-Roco, it's just that I think that he's the least evil of the presidentiables.  To think that I still have to submit a paper for English next week, I believe that this topic is a good start.  I'm suppossed to compare and contrast two stuff/people/anything.

       This weekend was made up of both good and bad stuff.   SATURDAY:  Good:   urlLink Maitha ,  urlLink Alex , Louis, and I were able to finish our MP (Hangman) because of our combined efforts.  They came over here yesterday, and  though there were some moments of despair and hopelessness, we were still able to eliminate the problems that have bugged the said program.  Well, this just proves that  four heads (yeah, not two)  are better than  one .  Bad:  Right after my  Java Berks  had left, I hurried back home to take a shower so that I could  then go to the Live A.I.D.S. concert at the UP College of Music.  Before I had my shower, I first looked for my ticket, assuming that I left it inside the car.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it.  I asked our helper to still look for it, then I went upstairs and took a shower. I even wore one of my dad's polo shirts because I was really in a hurry.   I was ready to leave if not for that stupid ticket.     Ate  told me that she was also not able to look for it.  Still not giving up hope, I went to the garage  and searched the whole car.  But I was unsuccessful.  I even checked if it was in my room, but unfortunately, it  was not there.    Waah! Nasasayangan ako 'dun sa ticket! It costs P150 and I was suppossed to watch that concert with my friends.   And so, I just went back to my room and texted  urlLink Suzanne  that I wouldn't  be able to come.  Nagmukmok ata ako for 15 minutes.  I kept telling myself: "Napakaburara mo!!! Ticket na nga  lang wawalain mo pa!!!" *Sigh*  Anyway, after that 15 minutes of depression, I went online to relieve myself  some of the stored-up stress.  I was successful this time. I was finally able to convince myself that these kind  of things do happen from time to time.  SUNDAY:   Bad:I was forced to get out of my bed earlier than my usual Sunday wake-up time because my tito and tita invited  us to go to some places in Manila with them.  I didn't eat breakfast because every one in this house was  hurrying up.  So, I attended the mass with an empty stomach.   Good: After the mass, we went to a place where we were able to play badminton. Yehey! This was the only time  that I was able to play badminton again.  I realized that I still have the passion for playing.  Good for me. After the game, my shirt was damped with sweat.  Fortunately enough, my tito had an extra polo shirt, so I was able to change my upper clothing.   We had our lunch at Kimono Ken somewhere along the controversial Diosdado Macapagal Road(or was that  Boulevard?).  I was so hungry that I almost attacked the first order that arrived - Yaki-Soba, even if it's not  mine. Haha. =D  So, that's it.  May this week be a productive one.

       Haay...ang gulo ng isip ko ngayon.  Kung anu-ano ang naiisip ko...    Hiniram ko kanina yung CD player ng pinsan ko.  Companion ko para sa sem-ender namin kung sakaling wala akong makausap.  Hmm, kainis naman kasi, wala kaming pambili ng I-Pod na ubod ng mahal.  Akalain mo ba namang P24,000 amp. Hehe.  Pero iniisip ko rin, yung mga merong i-Pod kaya, masaya na sa pagkakaroon ng gadget na 'to? Oo, pwede kang mag-store ng up to 10,000 mp3s gamit ito.  E, mapapakinggan mo ba lahat ng 10,000 songs na iyon sa isang biyahe? Nagtataka lang ako...e pwede naman siguro yung 100 songs na pinakagusto mo.  E 10,000 songs?!? Lahat ba nun gusto mo?!? Hehehe...  Siguro ok na ako sa cd player. Simple lang.  Kaunti lang ang maso-store ko na kanta sa isang audio cd, pero masisigurado ko na ang mga kantang iyon ay mga kanta na gusto ko talagang pakinggan habang nag-iisa ako.  Oo nga, mura lang, e ano ngayon?  At least hindi ka manghihinayang kung sakaling masira. ---  Napaisip ako na March 24, 2004 na pala.  Matatapos na ang first quarter ng taon na 'to.  Ang bilis nga naman talaga ng panahon, o.  E parang kahapon nagce-celebrate lang kami ng New Year, tapos eto, magi-April na kaagad.  At napaisip din ako na ang tanda ko na pala.  Ba't ganun?!? Ang bilis bilis ng time! Parang kanina lang 12 years old ako na curious kung ano na kaya ang gagawin ko kung 17 years old na ako tapos ngayon 17 years old na nga ako.  Hhmmm... ---  Medyo malungkot ako.  Kasi naman, itong sina  urlLink Lex  at Justin niloko ako na si Justin e mag-aaral sa UPLB.  Siyempre natuwa talaga ako nung una nilang sinabi sa'kin kasi ine-expect ko na may kasama na ako sa UP System.  Sinabi ko pa sa parents ko, pati sa tito at tita.  Parang ang feeling ko  sa wakas, may makaka-relate na rin sa'kin tungkol sa mga isyung UP! .  Pero hindi...isa lamang palang malaking biro yun.  Nung nalaman ko na pakulo lang pala nila 'yun, talagang nasaktan ako kasi umasa talaga ako.  Pero ngayon, ok na, napatawad ko naman sila agad.  Pero nandito pa rin sa loob ko yung pagnanasa na sana maski isa man lang sa kanila ay kasama ko sa unibersidad. Kaya nalulungkot pa rin ako.    Sa totoo lang, minsan gusto ko nang umalis ng UP.  Masyadong nabubulatlat sa'kin ang mga social problems ng bansa.  Gusto kong tumakas para makalimot man lang sa mga problema na yun.  Parang ang bibigat kasi ng problema na pati ako naapektuhan.  Ewan ko kung bakit.  *sigh*  Kaya siguro gusto ko na kasama ko sila, para may kausap naman ako tungkol sa mga bagay-bagay na may kinalaman dun.  Gusto ko rin na malaman nila kung ano  talaga  ang nangyayari.    ---  Hindi ako makatulog.  May final exam ako sa English 1 bukas ng 1:45 hanggang 3:45.  Magigising naman siguro ako bago mag-ala-una, 'di ba? ---  Minsan naiisip ko pa'no kaya kung totoo ang Matrix?  Pano kung lahat ng nangyayari sa'kin ngayon e mga ilusyon lang?  Pano kung lahat ng inaakala kong totoo e hindi pala totoo at dala lang ng messages ng utak na minomonitor ng mga kompyuter? ...    ---  Old friends.  Nakakainis yung feeling na nawalan na kayo ng connection ng old friends mo.  Lalo na kung yung mga friends mo na yun ay malapit talaga sa puso mo.  Kahit gaano pa man ka-advance ang technology ngayon, hindi pa rin ito makakatulong kung sobrang wala ka nang time para makipag-communicate sa kanila. ---  Gusto kong matutong magbasketbol.  Wala lang. --- ---

       Kainis! Hindi na ako magte-take ng Kas1 third long bukas...hindi ako masyadong nakapag-prepare e.  Tingin ko mas ok na rin yun kaysa i-risk ko yung grade ko...baka mas bumaba pa.  BTW, 2.75 ang magiging final grade ko kung ganun.  Haay...kainis.  /**Sem-ender*/ Yey! Sa Los Banos yung sem-ender ng SUMS+UP. Hehehe. Sana makasama si Charm para may ka-kilala naman ako dun.  Pero kung hindi man siya makakapunta, sasama pa rin ako.  Kelangan ko yun para maging system administrator ng computer room dun sa Math building!   /**Mga gagawin ko this summer*/ Hhhmmm...eto ang mga bagay-bagay na balak kong gawin this coming summer season:  1. Mag-take ng summer subjects: Math53, CWTS, any GE. 2. Mag-guitar lessons! Pero kanino ako hihiram ng gitara? 3. Mag-practice at pag-aralan ang mga programming languages(Java & C)! 4. Tumulong sa org activities: ayusin ang tambayan, FOPC tasks, etc. 6. Mag-plano ng mga gagawin sa next AY! 7. Ano pa ba? Suggestions are welcome! hehe...  /**Politika*/ Haay naku, nakakainis na talaga ang mga tumatakbong presidente:  Si Gloria, ginagamit ang public funds sa campaign(e, ano pa nga ba?), si Roco mahina pa rin at walang ginawa kundi i-pursige ang debate, si FPJ sinuportahan pa ni Guingona, si Bro. Eddie naman...ano? Wala akong maisip kung anong issue sa kanya...hehehe.  Si Lacson, ayun, nagfi-feeling mas sikat kay FPJ.  Haay...basta disappointed ako sa set ng candidates.  Hindi ba pwedeng iba na lang ang mga tumakbo? Yung mga may 'K' talaga?

       Thanks to  urlLink kikiam  and  urlLink aoi , i might put up a new blog layout because  urlLink one  of their sites offered tutorials on how to make a blog layout.  But maybe not til our second long exam in math53 is finished.  Anyway, here's one of the columns of Mr. Randy David that I'd like to share with people who just don't know why GMA is leading the latest surveys:   urlLink The quest for preemptive stability   I'm praying that Roco's  urlLink coming home  on Wednesday would trigger a dramatic change in his chance of winning.  In my honest opinion, he's the least evil of the 5 presidential candidates(considering that many people call him "the best among the worst").

       Childhood innocence.  This is one of the themes that I like most in J.D. Salinger's  Catcher in the Rye .  It reminds me of my past, and my almost uncorrupted way of life.  Why is it that when we were still children, we've always enjoyed the small things?  Small things - I mean those small stuff that makes us happy almost everytime it happens to us.  Things like our parents coming home from work, and we greet them as if we hadn't seen them for a month.  Things like going over to our neighbor's house and play with the other children all day long.  Things like begging for an ice cream and finally being appeased to stop our cries?  Then suddenly, at this point of my life(pre-adulthood), these things become more and more insignificant and almost stupid.  We begin wanting the 'bigger things'.  Bigger things - materialistic and selfish wants.  These wants are always bothering us no matter where we go.  Examples of these are the latest gadgets, popularity, and the thirst for praise.  I think it's kind of funny that we tend to forget that the small things that we want when we were still children are actually more important and more relevant than the 'big things' that we want when we get older.  Say for example the process of communication.  When we were children, we were easily satisfied when we get the chance to have a good conversation with a close friend.  Then adolescence comes in.  You substitute chatting using mIRC for nice and clean conversations because chatting is more 'in' and popular than talking personally to a friend.  One more thing that I liked in the book is its adherence to the reality that the society has become a really "phony" structure.  It's as if everyone is supposed to follow the norms that it has establised through time.  That if someone violates the conventions of society, he or she would be ostracized for not following the unwritten rules.   Holden Caulfield is a really interesting character, because he demonstrates the cynical adolescent.  He is the epitome of a teenager who has been disillusioned by the selfish ways of the world.  He hates almost everything about the world that some critics accuse him of being a misanthrophist.  I don't believe that this accusation is fair.  I mean, who wouldn't be confused and hateful with the corrupted ways of present day's society?  ---  There are times when I just want to become a child again.  Those times when you don't have to worry about grades, appearance, social perceptions, etc.  I miss those carefree days...those blissful endless days.

       This summer semester, I'm taking up Math 53 a.k.a. Elementary Analysis I as a pre-requisite for higher math and computer science subjects.  For today's lesson, we tackled Implicit Differentiation and Higher Ordered Derivatives.  I really understood each part of these lessons, that I almost wanted to stay in the Math Building forever and get dy/dx of all functions, whether thay exist or not(I'm sarcastic with this statement!).  I didn't feel quite good while we were having classes because I have some colds and cough.  Usually, I'm not in a good mood to understand what the teacher is saying when I'm in this condition.  All throughout the class, I just stared at what our teacher was writing on the board, without really trying to digest what they mean.    I have 2 Xientian classmates, Ron and Adrian, and a blockmate,  Mark.  Also, Noel Feria, a schoolmate of mine when I was in grade school, is incidentally also my classmate.   My problem with math is that although I get to understand the lessons, I'm too unenthusiastic when it comes to practicing and applying the concepts.  Maybe that's why I get low grades in Math.    I'm praying that hopefully, I'd be able to pass my Math 53.  After Math 53, I still have to go through Math54, Math55, ad Math157, not to mention the other pseudo-computer science subjects.  ...   On PGMA's lead in the Surveys   Some people are reasoning out that they would be voting for Mrs. Pidal because it could help stop a FPJ presidency.  For me, this reason is such a huge CRAP.  In elections, you don't vote for someone to stop another candidate, you're supposed to vote for someone you believe has the proper platform the ease the country's problem.  And in my honest opinion, a vote for GMA is a vote to allow her to continue what she has been doing for the past three years - supporting an unjustified "war on terror", improper budget allotment, cronyism, and use of public and government funds in not-so-service-oriented ways.  Are we going to allow her to keep on doing these nice deeds until 2010?  I'm not saying that I prefer FPJ over GMA, what I'm trying to say is that GMA and FPJ are not the only presidential candidates out there.  And those who are not given proper public attention are those who are more deserving to become presidents than 'Da King'  and 'Da Queen'.  I admit that for me, Raul Roco is the most qualified to become president of this country.  Sadly, popular politics is still rampant in this almost hopeless nation.  I'm quite sure that whoever wins the elections, Edsa IV will definitely be staged.   Filipinos always think that a revolution would make everything alright.      When will we ever learn?!?

        The Order of the Phoenix  redeemed itself with its exciting last three chapters.  I was just about to give up reading the fifth volume of the Harry Potter series when I finally read the third to the last chapter.      All in all, it was not a book to match the brilliance of  The Prisoner of Azkaban .  Many parts of book five seem to be written while J.K. Rowling is bored watching TV.  But still, the concluding chapter managed to save the thirty-seven chapters prior to it.  I'm just hoping that volume 6, The Green Flame Torch(the rumored title) would prove to be a better-written novel than book 5.

        Day 1  - April 2, 2004  It was already quarter to 1 A.M.  We're supposed to leave the house by 1 A.M. to go to Makisig(the street where our closest relatives reside) so that all the baggage could be sorted out.  I was still chatting with some of my friends in YM.  I eventually got myself to finish my packing, then I had shower, said goodbye to my friends, and turned off the lights in my room.  I can't believe I did all of these within 15 minutes.    I then found out that I was the only one in the household who've had shower already.  To cut the long story short, we left the house at around 1:30 A.M.  Upon arriving at Makisig, I saw Ate Ging(a cousin) and her boyfriend watching the Last Samurai.  Also present in the living room were Tito Richard and his family.  The whole lot of us left at around 2:30 A.M.   The whole lot of us, I mean: My Family – 5 Venz's Family w/ Ate Ging's Boyfriend – 7 Jil's Family – 4 Tito Richard's Family – 4 Tito Jobey's Family – 3 Tito Bong and his girlfriend - 2  Tita Rose – 1 Tito Jhun with her daughter – 2  All in all, there were 28 of us who were all ready to go off to this year's RD outing.  My mom planned the outing together with my Tita Gie, my father's sister and Venz's mom.    At around 9:30 A.M. we were finally able to reach Puerto de San Juan in La Union, a resort-hotel.  We dislodged our bags from the vehicles.  Then the younger people decided that we should be staying in one of the rooms near the pool, while the adults would be staying at the room that is not so near the swimming areas.  When afternoon came, Ate Ging and her sister decided to start the game that they've prepared for the La Union outing.  It’s an Amazing Race type of game.  There were 6 pairs who served as contestants.  I decided to team up with one of my cousins, Jil.  Usually, when these kinds of game happen, I team up with Venz. But for that occasion, he was sleeping soundly in our room near the pool.  The game's venue was near the beach at the edge of Puerto de San Juan.  The game finished with me and Jil in 4th place. The champions in the game were my sister and her boyfriend.  We were supposed to swim in the beach, but seeing that the waves are quite strong, we just thought of swimming in one of the pools.  We played with my little sister's beach ball.   After swimming, everyone opted to take a shower before having the dinner.  While I was waiting for my turn, I was watching the news and playing WarCraft3 at the same time.  I was a bit surprised when TV Patrol announced that an Atenean topped the bar exams. Well, maybe not just a bit.  I was REALLY surprised.  Only one law student from UP was able to get into the top 10.  And she got the seventh place.  When I started to say something like "Bakit puro Ateneo?", Ate Ging, who's taking her MA in the Ateneo said, "E bakit? Magaling naman talaga sila e."  I can't agree more.*  Since dinner had already been set, I decided to eat dinner first before taking a bath. After dinner, we went back to our room, and I waited until the one before my turn is finished in the showers.  I finally took a bath after Kuya Edric's turn, and after doing so, I read a few pages of Ibong Mandaragit.  I dozed off for about two hours. When I woke up, I realized that it's already 11:30 P.M.  Everyone was already sleeping except Venz, who was watching the TV in the living room.  He was watching the teeny-bopper movie Jologs.  At around midnight, he was already sleeping in one of the couches.    Day 2 – April 3, 2004   After about an hour reading book 5 of the Harry Potter series, I got bored and decided to watch a DVD movie.  I got Venz's laptop from its bag, set it up, and inserted the Mona Lisa Smile DVD.  I finished the movie at around 3 A.M.  It's not really that bad, it's just well, dull.  The whole feminist concept is so common nowadays that I don't think I got anything useful from the movie.  I slept around 3:30 A.M.  By 10 A.M., I was told to get up from my bed by Ate Tin.  Breakfast time had passed and I'm the only one who haven't eaten yet.  I washed my face, and went immediately to the adults' room.  I ate breakfast while my mom and aunt gave me some sermon about sleeping late and waking up past breakfast time.  After eating, I hurried back to our room to take a bath and after doing so, packed up my things and brought them to the van.  Lunch time also meant cleaning up time for all of us. While the others are eating, some adults packed their things and arranged their stuff in the vehicles.  By 1:30 P.M., everyone was ready to leave.  The trip to Baguio was generally smooth except for two events.  One was when my grandma called me up to announce that Waffle, our dog, had gone out her gate, and is missing at that time.  I told my sister to immediately call mom and tell her what just happened.  When Ma learned about this, she started crying and muttering words like "Ibaba nyo na ako" because she wants to go to Villasis, Pangasinan to help find our dog.    The other one was when one of my cousins really needs to heed nature's call.  So when we passed by one of the buildings on our way to Baguio, she immediately got off the van and relieved herself.  Also that time, our grandma called us again and told us the Waffle had already been found.  She was seen in the gym in Villasis school, watching a basketball game.  When we heard this, Mama was crying tears of joy, and we wondered how our dog was able to go there, considering that she had to cross a busy highway before she reached the side where the gym is located.   By 4 P.M., we arrived in a rest house in Baguio.  After eating our merienda, 5 of my cousins and I played Monopoly, while Ate Ging and Ate Tin with their boyfriends played Taboo.    Later in the evening, at around 7 P.M., we stopped playing because everyone else wanted to watch Star Circle Quest.  After the episode, we had dinner, and then they decided to play charades.  I, feeling sick because I just caught some cold, just continued reading The Order of the Phoenix.  Everyone decided to sleep by 12 midnight.  Meanwhile, while everyone else were sleeping, Venz and I watched Duplex before dozing off.   Day 3 – April 4, 2004   The moment I opened my eyes, I knew at once that everyone is busy packing their stuff.  It was around 7 A.M. when I got myself up from where I slept.  We had Arroz Caldo for breakfast.    We left the place at 9 AM and went straight to the nearest Church.  I wasn't aware that it was Palm Sunday.    After attending the mass, we had lunch at Omai Khan(if read from an Ilocano perspective, this would mean come here).  They served Mongolian dishes.  Still irritated with my running nose, I asked my aunt for a Neozep tablet.  I immediately took it when the waitress served a glass of water.  After the lunch, we went to a place where people could play Mini-Golf.  I'm not really sure what the name of this place is.  While the others played mini-golf, I and 5 others went to play billiards.  It was my first time to play the game in actual manner.  I had to be taught the first time I tried hitting a ball.  I enjoyed playing, though I think I need more practice.  When we returned from the game area, the people who were playing mini-golf were still not finished.  While waiting for them, some of us played the very addictive Pusoy-Dos.  After four games, the mini-golfers returned their clubs to where they got it.  We then left for Mile Hi.  Not much was done there except the occasional imported chocolate buying.  Everyone was then sick of Baguio, which to my surprise is not really giving me the cool shivers I had when we last went there in December.  So, we decided that this outing deserves a conclusion.  We started our trip to Villasis, Pangasinan.    We had dinner at Max's, where I also had the chance to remove the chocolate that got stuck on my hand phone when I put it in one of my pockets which had chocolate remains on it.    We arrived in Pangasinan at 9 P.M.  Because the following day would be a work day, the working people left the non-working people(including me) to stay for a week of vacation there.  They then returned on Thursday, the start of the Holy Week holidays. - - -   Day 9 – April 11, 2004    At 1:39 A.M., we finally got back home.  Whew.  What a vacation.  Not to mention that before Day 1, I went to the 1 day and 1 night sem-ender of SUMS+UP.    And tomorrow's the start of the summer class enrolment?!?  *SIGH*  ||There are still about 20 pages of Harry Potter Book 5 left for me to read.  Boy, I can't believe this book's got around 900 pages.

       Current read: By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept by Paolo Coelho Now listening to: Jet - Are You Gonna Be My Girl  This is the day that I learned...that I've finally passed my Math53(Elementary Analysis I)!!! Woohoo!!! After all the pain, suffering, tension, pressure, and tireless nights of studying(of course with the help of Sir Gilbert and Ate Ging, my very smart cousin), all of these finally paid off. Haaay!!!  After getting my grade at the 2nd floor of Math building, I went to see my good friend  urlLink Jezrel , who was just entering the Math building at the momemt.  We decided to eat lunch at Robinson's MetroEast.  We also went to see the movie  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow .   It was a good movie.  At least I liked it much better than "Troy", that stupid movie.

       Now listening to: Alicia Keys - If I Ain't Got You  Hmm.. wala akong magawa.  Katatapos lang ng removals nung isang araw.  Sana naman pasado yun.  Meron pala akong ikekwento! Nung nagrereview ako para dun sa removals, kasi diba may tungkol sa derivatives ng trigo functions..here's what happened: I came along a problem that needs to get the derivative of secant x(secx).  As i was writing down it's derivative, my cousin who's been reviewing me was watching closely.  Supposedly, its derivative is secxtanxdx.  What happened was this: I absent-mindedly wrote 'secx' without the 'c' (sex)!  And my cousin saw it! She was a bit shocked and started laughing.  I was SO embarassed. I mean, I didn't intend to write that down.    ---  I've just finished reading  urlLink The Da Vinci Code  last week.   It was a good read.  I think that the most interesting parts of the book are those that revealed the Catholic Church's dark and deceptive history.

       I really wasn't expecting to get a grade of 4.0 in my math53...  I was somehow expecting a 5.0.  Getting a grade of 4.0 means I need to take a removal exam to remove my grade of 4.0.  It's either I pass that the exam to pass the subject or I fail it to get a 5.0.  I felt somehow relieved because I thought I really am going to retake this subject.  But thank God, I still have a chance to pass my summer course.  My summer wasn't a total waste after all!   *sigh*  I'm just hoping and praying that I will pass this last test.

       Last night, Justin and I planned to play badminton this morning.  He brought his friend, Mario, along with him.  We played for an hour and decided to change our clothes in the showers before leaving.  I had a great time talking with them and felt comfortable with Justin's friend.    Before we left Star Smash Badminton Center in Timog, I saw Purp coming to us.  A was a bit surprised because I didn't know that they play badminton at the same badminton center our family plays in.  She asked me to notify her the next time Mario, Justin and I play badminton again.  When we left, we decided to eat lunch at Burger King which is just near that area.  I ate Mushroom Swiss and fries(detailed talaga eh, 'no), Mario ate Beef Steak while Justin ate a Whopper Jr. and fries.  We had even more interesting conversations about their classmates, the colleges they are going in to, their interests, etc.  I learned that Mario and I had a common friend.  It was Geof Gaddi (I'm not sure of his first name).  Geof was a classmate and friend back when I was 2nd grade in grade school.  Mario told me the Geof was his best friend.    The weather at that time was not friendly, and so I invited them to spend some time in our house while thay wait for the rains to stop.  Upon arriving at our house, the rain fell harder...  Tinatamad na akong magkwento. Hehehe.

       Masama bang maging loner?  Napaisip lang ako, kasi dati naisip ko, masama ang pagiging loner dahil katumbas na rin nito ang ZERO percent social life.  Pero lately, na-realize ko, hindi naman talaga ganon kasama ang pagiging isang loner.  Mas naintindihan ko ang sitwasyon ng mga loner dahil nadiskubre ko na pwede pala akong makasama sa Loners Club.  Hindi naman ako loner dati, ngayun-ngayon lang.  Napansin kong loner nga ako ngayong mga panahon na wala akong kausap tungkol sa mga problema.  Hindi naman na dahil sa puro problema lang ang laman ng utak ko e kelangan ko na ng kausap.  Siguro yung mga kasama ko lang ngayon ay hindi ganon ka-interesado sa nangyayari sa akin kumpara sa mga kaibigan ko dati.    Hindi rin naman masama kung wala silang pakialam sa akin.  Siyempre ngayong college, kanya-kanyang buhay na.  Para bang 'walang pakialamanan'.  "Mind your own business," ika nga.  Pero wala lang, napaisip lang ako, "gano'n na ba talaga ka-selfish ang mga tao ngayon?".  Puro sarili ang iniisip.  Ako din, ganun, inaamin ko, maraming pagkakataon na laging sarili ko ang iniisip ko.   Ang masaklap pa ngayon, kahit yung best friend ko, hindi na rin ako kinakausap.  Nahihiya naman akong tumawag kasi pag tumatawag ako laging may ginagawa siya, o kaya may gagawin siya, o kaya parang wala lang talaga siya sa mood makipag-usap.  At madalas, pag tatawag ako, ang lagi niyang sinasabi sa akin ay kahit ano sa mga salitang ito: pathetic, useless, spoiled, naive.  Hindi ko na nga maalala yung iba e.    O siguro, ganon lang talaga, since hindi na kami nagkakasama nang madalas ngayong college, e medyo parang wala na rin kaming ganang makipag-usap sa isa't isa.  E bakit may mga kaibigan naman ako na kahit matagal na panahon ko nang hindi nakakausap e eager na eager pa rin akong kausapin sila?  Hhmmm...may theory na ako.  Ang best friend kong ito ay hindi talaga meant na maging best friend.  Siguro friend lang, pero hindi yung pangmatagalang friendship.  Ganun kaya yun.  Anyway, ok lang sakin kung ganon nga.  Ganon naman ang buhay e, walang permanente.  Ayun pa pala. Siguro kaya okay din sa akin ang pagiging loner kasi minsan napapaisip ka kung sino talaga ang mga dapat mong kaibiganin at hindi.  Narerealize mo kung sinu-sinong tao yung talagang pahahalagahan mo, on a long-term basis.  At kung sino din ang mga karapat-dapat na makatanggap ng friendship na gusto mong ibigay.  --  I was able to see Troy last night with my cousins at G4.  It wasn't as good as I expected.

       Yes, I am a loner.  Anything wrong with that?  I just find it more comfortable to be on my own than being with some other people I'm not comfortable being with.    No, I'm not anti-social. I still consider other people's feelings, not just mine.   Yes, I am an idealist.  I often aspire for better things in the status quo.    But no, I'm not impractical.  I definitely look for the more pragmatic ways to solve problems.  Yes, I am submissive.  Well, it depends on the situation.  But I admit that I am have indeed been submissive in many parts of my life.  And I regret some of them.  But regretting is for losers.  Does that make me a loser?  No, I am not a conformist.  As I said, I look for the more pragmatic ways in life.  Sometimes, the more trendy is the less practical.

       I'm still not sure whether I would pursue this thing.  Adrian (a Xientian and currently a classmate in math53) had urged me to apply with him for scholarship in a Japanese university.  I'm still pretty much undecided which course I would be taking and which Japanese university I would like to get in to(considering that the deadline would be...tomorrow!).  I'm not expecting to pass the exam, because as Adrei said, it is really a hard test(maybe compared to the UPCAT).  Also, I won't be dreaming too much to go to Japan to study because I'm already satisfied and contented with where I am now. --- Summer classes are about to end.  Hopefully, I would pass my maths so I could stop worrying over my delay.  Aargh.

       Last week, I've finished reading  Daddy Long-Legs  by Jean Webster.  Although I liked many parts of the book, I was a bit disappointed with the last part because it was very predictable.  This week, I've started with  Eleven Minutes  by Paolo Coelho.  I've read about 3/4 of the book by now.  It's about this woman who was beautiful and smart, and decided to be a prostitute.  Although I haven't finished reading the book yet, I'm sure that I would again feel good after reading this.  I'm beginning to believe that prostitution is not really an immoral profession.  Being a prostitute doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your ideals, virtues, and beliefs, it's just that you have decided to invest in your body to earn money.  There's exactly nothing wrong with that.  It's a matter of personal choice. --- In the meantime, I wouldn't be able to put up a new layout very soon because my math53 is frustrating me.   --- 5 more days to go before elections...

        Mood: Heavy Current Read: Calculus II by Prof. Ortega - Talaue Started this entry while listening to: Joss Stone - Super Duper Love      Instead of studying for my math quiz and reading the assigned notes for CS, I was at the living room watching  urlLink Nip Tuck  in ETC. It was my first time to watch this series.  Although it was already the eighth episode, I didn't have a hard time grasping the flow of the story.  I noticed that Nip Tuck is somehow similar to HBO's Six Feet Under in a sense that while Nip Tuck revolves around a plastic surgery business, Six Feet Under has its Fisher & Sons Funeral Service.  Both industries(plastic surgery and funeral services) are both controversial and are sometimes given dark impressions.  I've noticed that I'm really becoming 'in' to these kinds of shows.  Shows with dark atmospheres and complex social themes.  I'm not sure why I'm becoming more and more attracted to these kinds of themes.  Maybe because they seem realistic?  Also, there were many parts of the episodes that I somehow felt sensitive with. I'm really getting weird...  When I ask other people if they also watch Six Feet Under, they would most of the time answer me either with a no, or this one: "I tried watching one episode but I found it too heavy".  Yes, I also think that the episodes are a bit heavy, but isn't that what's supposed to make one want to watch it more?  To better understand a TV series, one should try to absorb its themes and atmosphere to level himself or herself with the show's ambience.  I personally think that it's a good feeling to know that you can "carry" the show.  --  Nip Tuck employs a controversial industry and mixes it up with the complicated lives of the surgeons, their families and their patients.  Tonight's episode presented a woman who wanted to get a nose job.  She was asked some personal questions for her profile.  During the interview, the surgeon and his assistant discovered the woman's real intention of having a nose job -- it would help her erase the memories of being abused in her childhood. Her father raped her when she was still small.  Her nose reminds her of her father, because they basically have the same structure and appearance of nose.    --  Other parts of this episode were concerned with a priest who underwent plastic surgery to cover up evidence of molestation. Another one was about this young lady who had been a victim of hit-and-run - by one of the surgeons' son.   --  Towards the end of the show, the woman who had been wanting a nose job decided not to continue the operation.  She realized that even if she had undergone a plastic surgery, she would still be reminded of her dark past, if she did not put a stop on the memories herself.  Her quest for moving on had gone to a deeper level - into an emotional level.   --  Many people seek for physical perfection, not realizing that they do this to cover up emotional scars and social pressures.

Mukhang wala lang akong magawa ngayon kaya ako nag-post ng entry na 'to.    --  Kanina, nag-recit class kami sa Physics 71 at mabuti naman na partner ko si  urlLink Maitha  dahil nakinig siya sa lecture kahapon at may ilang mahahalagang tanong na nabanggit kahapon.  E kahapon naman habang naglelecture si Cheetah Magrasa (ang tawag nila sa aming instructor), ang ginawa ko lang ay tinapos ang  By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept  ni Paulo Coelho.  Natapos ko rin nung isa pang araw yung  Angels and Demons (sa wakas!) ni Ginoong Dan Brown.    --  Naka-perfect nga pala kami ni Mai sa recit class!

       Haay..nakakaewan ang unang dalawang araw ng school week na ito.   Nung Lunes, gumising ako nang maaga para hanapin ang borrower's card ko para maibalik ko na ang tatlong libro na hiniram ko sa Library ng College of Engineering. Due date kasi nun ay June 21.  Hindi ako successful sa paghahanap ko ng kolor blue na card na ito. Kaya't ang ginawa ko ay nagpunta na ako sa school na umaasang makakagawa ako ng paraan para makakuha ng bagong borrower's card.  Pagdating ko sa Melchor Hall, dali-dali akong nagmadali papunta sa MH 239 dahil 9:45 na at ang klase ko ay 9:30.  "Late na naman...," naisip ko.  Nung malapit na ako sa computer room, ayun at nasa harapan ko na pala si Ma'am Florence, ang aming instructor sa CS21.   Pagpasok ko sa loob ng MH239, binati ako ni Liz, isang blockmate at kaibigan.  May nakita akong isang malaking pasa sa kanyang kaliwang braso.  Adrian: "Uy, hi Liz! Hehehe..." Liz: "Hello rap! Ei, may ikekwento ako sayo mamaya.." Adrian: "O sige...siguro tungkol kay ano 'no?!"  Liz: "Hindi yun! Basta ikekwento ko sayo.." Adrian: "O sige na nga..basta mamaya ha.."  Tapos ayun, naglecture na ng tungkol sa Processors, ang CPU, ang mga parts nito na Arithmetic Logic Unit, Control Unit at Registers.  At sa pagsapit ng 11:12 A.M., nagpasyang idismiss na kami ng aming napakabait at napakagandang intstructor.  Paglabas ng MH239, naglakad lakad lang muna ako sa west wing corridors ng ikalawang palapag ng College of Engineering.  Mayamaya lamang ay may narinig akong tumatawag sa aking pangalan, "Rap!". At ayun na nga si Liz...  Adrian: "Ano bang nangyari sayo?!" Liz: "Nabagsakan ako ng gate.." Adrian: "Ah...ha?!?!" Liz: "Oo, nabagsakan nga ako ng gate! Ganito kasi yun..."  At dahil sa pag-uusap naming ito, tuluyan ko nang naunawaan kung bakit mayroon siyang malaking pasa sa kaniyang kaliwang braso.  Susunod na klase: Math 54.  Elementary Analysis II.  Itinuro sa amin ni Prof. Ortege - Talaue ang  Length of Arc of the Graph of a Function .  Ayun..ipina-recall sa amin ang Mean Value Theorem na una naming narinig sa aming mga Math 53 na klase.  Natapos ang klase ng 12:45 at dali-dali akong nagpunta sa AS... dahil gusto ko lang makita ang mga kaibigan ko na tumatambay dun.    Lumipas ang isa't kalahating oras.  Nagpunta na ako sa aking Physics 71 class. Doon naman, nagturo ng tungkol sa Circular Motion si binibining Mag-usara.  Siyempre, hindi na naman ako nakinig dahil alam kong lahat nang pinagsasabi niya sa harap ay mababasa ko rin sa University Physics, Ninth Edition.  Kinopya ko na lamang ang mga binigay niyang sample problem at sinagutan ang mga ito.    Sa kalagitnaan ng klase, nagkuwentuhan kami ni Liz.  Nabanggit niya muli ang crush niya na kaklase namin sa pisiks.  Nang dumaan ang attendance sheet, biglang nagka-ideya si Liz na kunin ang student number ng crush niya.  Ang reaksyon ka naman sa ideya niya ay: "Ikaw talaga Liz!!," sabay palo sa kanyang kaliwang braso. Nawala sa isip ko na nabagsakan pala siya ng gate nila..at ayun..napa-aray siya at natawa.  Natawa na lang kaming pareho sa nangyari kahit alam ko na nasaktan siya.  Mas natawa pa nga ata ako kaysa nakaramdam ng awa.  Ang wirdo ko talaga.  Natapos na din ang klase at diretso uwi na ako.  What a maddening monday..

       Mood: Freaky Now listening to: Maroon 5 - Sunday Morning  While everyone else(my relatives) are chatting outside this room, here I am, taking refuge from all the noise and discomfort.  I don't really feel like celebrating Father's Day(whoever invented this event?!).  Yes, I know, Fathers' Day is supposed to be tomorrow, but then my very nice cousins decided to celebrate it tonight in order for them to do their school work tomorrow.  *sigh*  This is such a freaky day.  I'm not about to greet my father a Happy Father's Day tomorrow because I don't think that it's a day for me to celebrate.  I've just got so much anger for him that I can't have the guts to be  plastic  with anyone for this...ehem..."special day".  ---    I was able to see  Dawn of the Dead  last Wednesday with a friend,  urlLink Jay-R .  I think that it's even better than  Resident Evil , which I gave too high expectations, considering that it originated from a highly popular video game.  Although it wasn't explained as to how the people became zombies, the flow of the story was good.  There were even some funny parts.  Funny in the sense that the directors really ought those scenes to be funny, not the kind of "funny" I experienced when I saw  The Grudge .  Speaking of movies, I can't wait to see the sequel of the first Spiderman movie.  ---  The University of the Philippines turned 96 years old yesterday.  It's a bit weird because I didn't feel any kind of celebration.  All that I saw were banners displayed near the Oblation.  Is that how a school celebrates its foundation? hehehe...    Even though I wasn't able to attend the celebrations(were there any?), all I can say is that I'm still very proud of my University(no school-bashing intended here).  I just hope that the government would get its act together soon and do its best to try and preserve UP's honor and excellence.  It's time for the academic community to get the attention it truly deserves.  ---  Earlier this day, the CWTS class of Ms. Victoria Jardiolin went to the Marikina Boys' Town.  There, we were oriented by the housekeepers of the MBT to its four (4) different units namely, the Boys' Home, The Girls' Home, The Foundlings' Home, and the Home for the Aged.      I found the old people's resting places heart-crushing.  Their beds(or are those really beds?!) do not have  kutsons , which makes me wonder how uncomfortable it would be for them to sleep.  Also, I felt pity for them when I saw their rooms(which looked more like jail cells).    I'm still not sure what project our group would like to propose.  But hopefully, we could agree in helping to renovate one of the cottages where the young orphans stay.

       Mood: Irritated Current Read: Angels and Demons pa rin (waaahhh!!!) at By the River Piedra(pinagsabay daw) Now listening to: Corrs - All the Love in the World  Natutuwa ako sa Marinara!!!    Mukhang susubaybayan ko talaga 'tong kwelanovela na 'to!!! Ok ang opening theme niya.  Some parts of the song contained many of Rufa Mae's famous words like "Go go go! Fight Fight Fight!" and "Kahit masikip sa dibdib".  I think GMA-7 is about to nail the competition with the creation of this new segment.  --  With only a few weeks left before the new(Is she really new?!) president(Whom we all know cheated massively and is power-hungry) resides in the Malacanang Palace, I feel a bit hopeless about the country's present situation.  Lately, I've been reading stories of families migrating to the US "for greener pastures".  Is there really no more hope for our well, I'm sad to say this..dying country?  Even though many of the administration people are telling that the salvation of the country depends upon the cooperation of the Filipino people, I'm starting to really think that the Filipino had all the time doing their best to cooperate with the government.  I think it's the government's fault because it tolerates corruption, elitism, and Americanism.  The government should start doing something to save the country!  I firmly believe that the Filipino people had been giving sufficient amount of help and cooperation to the government.  It's the government that's not implementing the rules well, not disciplining its people sufficiently and not doing its job of serving the people.  --  I should be more positive of my outlook in life.  And also, I should be more confident about myself.  Self-pity is for losers.  Sympathy should be appropriated to the deserving, not the self-pitying.

       Current Read: Angels and Demons pa rin! (nyahaha!) Now listening to: Mathchbox20 - 3 AM  This song has been catching my attention lately.  And  I know why .  Michelle Branch All You Wanted  I wanted to be like you, I wanted everything. So I tried to be like you, And I got swept away.  I didn't know that it was so cold and, You needed someone to show you the way. So I took your hand and,  We figured out that when the tide comes I'll take you away.  If you want to I can save you, I can take you away from here.  So lonely inside, so busy out there,  And all you wanted was somebody who cares.   I'm sinkin' slowly, so hurry hold me. Your hand is all I have to keep me hangin' on. Please can you tell me, so I can finally see, Where you go when you're gone?  If you want to, I can save you. I can take you away from here. So lonely inside, so busy out there. And all you wanted was somebody who cares.  All you wanted was somebody who cares. If you need me you know I'll be there. Ho oh oh oh, yeah.   If you want to, I can save you. I can take you away from here. So lonely inside, so busy out there. And all you wanted was somebody who cared.   Please can you tell me, so I can finally see, Where you go when you're gone?

       Current Read: Angels and Demons Now listening to: The Corrs - Summer Sunshine  I was able to finish my registration for the first semester of the academic year 2004-2005 last friday.  Whew.  After three days of relentless walking, searching, driving, enlisting, and  lining up (which are  the most significant parts of the whole enrolment period), I am now officially enrolled to take 18 units in UP.      The first day of classes would start tomorrow, and here I am, doing nothing in front of the PC.   --   I'm actually a bit more confident, now that I'm a sophomore in  urlLink this University .  I can't believe that I was really able to finish the requirements I need to meet for my first year of stay here.  Now, I know I'd really really have to take school in a smarter and braver fashion.  I've learned many stuff during my freshman year, and I should be able to use those experiences to maximize the things that I can do in my second year.  Here are some stuff that I've got in mind for my second year in peyups:  1.  Join the UPJMA(UP Junior Marketing Association). 2.  Help in making SUMS+UP a stronger and better org. 3.  Take my computer science subjects(like CS21) more seriously(damn, I need these when I get to the real world). 4.  Take my math subject in a more relaxed and smart manner.  I shouldn't be hesitant to ask for help whenever I need one. 5.  Join the CRS WebTeam(if I pass their tests). 6.  Make stronger and wider connections with people. 7.  Maybe go to UP Manila to meet some friends there. 8.  Learn CSS and PHP! 9.  Learn Flash! 10. Complete the Paulo Coelho books.  I still don't have three of his books. 11. Get more accustomed to Linux, and do more explorations on it.  and more to come...

       Now listening to: Ruff Ends - Someone to Love You  I've made a simple layout for my new blog. I'm still not sure if this is the one that I'd be using upon moving to  urlLink Last-Piece.Net .   urlLink     Please do leave some comments, opinions or suggestions about the layout I've made. Please forgive me for the overly simplistic design, this is the first time I've tried making a layout. ---  urlLink     My third attempt to improve the layout.

I was truly amazed by the direction of this play.

       Currently Feeling : Instinctive Current Read:&nbsp; Walang Kamatayang Digital Fortress Started this&nbsp;entry while&nbsp;listening to: Alanis Morissette - Everything   Proseso ng Pakikinig .&nbsp; Napaka-inosente ng dating ng topic namin kanina sa Komunikasyon I.&nbsp; Pero ang klaseng ito ang nagpaalala sa akin na mayroong tatlong pinakaaasam-asam na mga bagay ang isang tao sa buhay niya ayon kay Ginoong Sigmund Freud.&nbsp; Ang tatlong ito ay:   1. Pagkain    2. Inumin    3. S-E-X     ---  Tama ang nabasa niyo.  SEX  nga. SEX. SEX. Isa pa: SEX. Oo nga pala, yan nga ang isa sa mga primitive instinct ng mga tao.&nbsp; Pero napaisip ako: " Bakit SEX? "  ---  Ang tatlong pinakaimportanteng carnal desires ng tao ay kasama sa mga instinct na gustong i-implement ng Id.&nbsp; Basta, sa psychology ata yun.&nbsp; Ang Id ang source ng lahat ng primitive instinct ng tao.&nbsp; May tanong lang talaga ako:  Bakit isa ang SEX sa mga primitive desires natin ?&nbsp; Kelangan ba talaga natin ang SEX para mabuhay nang matino?&nbsp;   ---  Sabi nga ng iba masarap gawin ang SEX.&nbsp; Pero dahil ba masarap itong gawin e kailangan talaga ito sa buhay ng tao?&nbsp; Ang pag-crave sa pagkain at inumin ay medyo naiintindihan ko pa. Pero ang pag-crave sa SEX? Ano ba ang scientific explanation kung bakit hinahanap-hanap ng tao ang SEX?  --- Meron pala akong nabasa dati na article sa net.&nbsp; May theory na  ang mga pinakamatatalinong tao sa mundo ay maaaring:     a) mahilig sa sex    b) produkto ng mga matatalinong magulang  Ang explanation yata dun sa letter A ay: Dahil nga primitive instinct ang SEX, magaling ang mga matatalinong tao na mahilig sa sex na maghanap ng partner.&nbsp; Ginagagawa ni lalaki ang lahat ng makakaya upang ma-attract si babae(at madalas, matatalinong lalaki daw ang talagang gagawa ng paraan para makamit ang minimithing improvement sa sarili).&nbsp; Ang babae naman ay nahahasa ang pagrarason dahil pinipili niya ang mga lalaki na naaabot ang standards niya. Ang resulta: Matatalinong mga anak na sa susunod ay maghahanap din ng mga matatalinong partner.&nbsp; And the story goes on...  Hindi ko maalala yung exact explanation pero parang ganun yung pagkakaintindi ko. (Pero porket magaling ka bang pumorma at magaling kang mamili e matalino ka na?!)  Yung letter B naman, may kinalaman sa genetics ata.&nbsp; Basta ganun. Hindi ako bio major e.&nbsp;&nbsp;   ---  Sa ibang dako naman:  [] Ako na lang yata sa Metro Manila ang hindi pa nanonood ng Mean Girls. [] Astig ang bagong office ng nanay ko.&nbsp; Parang gusto ko na ako na lang ang&nbsp; gumawa&nbsp;ng&nbsp;website&nbsp;para sa company nila.. [] Naiinis na ako sa CS21!!! Bwisit na assembly language yan...huhuhu... [] Exam sa Monday sa Math54.&nbsp; Ang coverage ay lahat ng techniques sa integration. Gudlak talaga&nbsp;saken. [] Sana maging Artist of the Month or Chosen One ang Maroon 5 sa August. Sana sana sana... Natutuwa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ako sa video ng She Will Be Loved!!! Pero, mukhang walang kinalaman ang video sa lyrics ng&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kanta.. [] Nagkakawithdrawal symptoms pala ako tuwing hindi ako nakakapag-internet.&nbsp; Sobrang moody ko&nbsp;kahapon.&nbsp; At nagbitter-bitteran pa ako.&nbsp; Napakawirdo ko talaga. [] At kung tama nga si pareng Sigmund Freud, 2 lang pala sa carnal instincts ko ang sinusunod ko!!! Hahahaha!!!!

        Feeling: Sleepy  Current Read:&nbsp; Digital Fortress(wala akong time magbasa...)  Now listening to: Liz Phair - Extraordinary    "I am extraordinary, if you'd ever&nbsp;get to know me.."   &nbsp;  This week was definitely one of those kind of weeks that could drive me  nucking futs .  &nbsp;  Monday  ---  CS21 : The results of the first long exam was returned.&nbsp; I'd like to kill myself the moment i got my paper.  Math54 : The first long exam results&nbsp;still hadn't been returned.&nbsp; Still waiting for a sign if I really should commit suicide or not..  Physics71: I know...I failed the first long exam because of my own arrogance.&nbsp; I really listened to this day's topic.  &nbsp;  Went to tambay at the  urlLink UPJMA  tambayan at the CBA after my Physics71 class.&nbsp; I stayed there from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tuesday  ---  Geog1: Yes, I was late again.&nbsp; I was always late since the first day of my Geog1 class.&nbsp; I'm so great.  Kom1: Our group, the  AquaMaroon Group  presented our model of communication.&nbsp; It was a model derived from a tree's structure.&nbsp; I was actually the one who suggested that we use nature as a model of communication.&nbsp; To cut the long story short, we decided that we would present this report by&nbsp;performing a little skit in front of the class.&nbsp; The group chose me to be  Adan .&nbsp; Now that really drove me crazy.  &nbsp;  Before our report, when we were conceptualizing what model we would like to present, our group had a pre-meeting at the New CAL Building(I didn't know that was what NCB stands for).  Some parts of the conversation:  &nbsp;  Groupmate No. 1 :&nbsp;"Anong modelo ba ang gagamitin natin?"  Groupmate No. 2: "Yung tulad na lang nung kay Shannon at Weaver, tapos i-modify natin..."  Adrian: "Bakit hindi na lang parang puno ang gawin nating model..para kunyari may flow between its parts tapos pwede nating sabihin na dynamic ang komunikasyon..."  Groupmate No. 1: "Hmm...ok yun ah.&nbsp; Anong course mo?"  Adrian: "Compsci.."  Groupmae No.2: "Saan mo nakuha yung ideyang yun...di ka naman bio or taga-College of Science?!"  Adrian: "Ha? Ewan ko..."  &nbsp;  Math54: Still no results.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just did some exercises based on the previous lessons.  Duckpin Bowling:&nbsp; This PE class&nbsp;is so weird.&nbsp; Why do&nbsp;we have to wear white shirt and pants every time we attend this&nbsp;@#$%^! class?!  Physics 71: Continuation of the previous day's lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I tried to fight off my laziness and I was able to successfully take down notes in a focused manner.  &nbsp;  Again, I&nbsp;did tambay&nbsp;at the UPJMA tambayan.&nbsp; By 5 pm, I&nbsp;went to the Math Building for a&nbsp;General Assembly of SUMS+UP.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 6:30,&nbsp; I went home and prepared for a business seminar.&nbsp; I went there with a friend, JM.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The seminar was finished by 10 pm.&nbsp; I hadn't eaten dinner before we went to that place, so I suggested to JM that we eat at the nearest McDo first before going home.&nbsp; Since JM and I had a lot of catching up to do, we ended up as the lone customers by 11 pm.&nbsp; I told him that he would have a hard time getting a ride back to Manila if he tried commuting by that time.&nbsp; So I offered him to sleep in our house for that night.&nbsp; Talk about impromptu sleepovers!  ***  Wednesday  ---  Before going to my CWTS class, I accompanied JM to McDo in Philcoa to meet with someone.&nbsp; Then, I arrived at my CWTS receiving news from my groupmates that we still didn't have anything to report.&nbsp; But then, when it was our turn to report, our very witty groupmates were able to report something.&nbsp; I didn't know where they got that impromptu report, but they were simply smart.  &nbsp;  Then at&nbsp;12 pm, I went to the Math building to meet some orgmates for a marketing meet.&nbsp; We marketed our asses off at our house&nbsp;until about 3:30 pm.&nbsp; I went back to UP to meet  urlLink Jay-R , whom I accompanied to buy SDIMM for his PC at the  urlLink PC Express  along Katipunan.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Jay-R also gave me a copy of Manila Kule:     I think that the layout is better and looks more organized than the Philippine Collegian.  ***  Thursay  ---  The rumors about the Diliman Summit were true.&nbsp; Classes were suspended from 10 am to 4&nbsp;pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;*^$%!!!  Nagmadali pa akong pumasok sa CS21 class namin...wala naman palang klase .&nbsp;&nbsp;So after learning that I have no class for my major, I went to AS to see some friends.&nbsp; I originally wanted to meet someone because I needed to photocopy some of her notes, but unfortunately, she still wasn't in UP.&nbsp; So what I did was, I went back to the parking lot,&nbsp; got my Borrower's Card and went to the main lib to borrow the creepy book that I need.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon entering the main library's doors, I realized that&nbsp;I left the keys inside the Paj.&nbsp; And I could&nbsp;remember that I checked&nbsp;if the doors were locked before I&nbsp;left the parking area.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so dead," I thought.&nbsp; I asked my mom to let someone bring the spare key to me.&nbsp; Fortunately, the spare key had been brought before I went to the OUR to pay some underassessed fees.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Because there&nbsp;was no classes, I decided to complete&nbsp;the required 8 hours of tambay for JMA.&nbsp; I tambayed from 10 am to 3 pm.&nbsp; That was 5 hours.&nbsp; I can't believe I survived 5 hours of being in a Conio Republic.&nbsp;  ***  Friday   ---     May Friday pa!?!&nbsp;  Ano ba naman 'tong linggong 'to. Hindi na ako pinatawad...     &nbsp;  Geog1:&nbsp; Not surprisingly, I came&nbsp;late for my Geography class.&nbsp; But this day was supposed to be something special..because the two classes of our prof was combined to participate in an Amazing Race type of game.&nbsp; When I arrived, I texted one of my friends and asked her if I could still join the race.&nbsp; She told me that she could meet me at the Faculty Center, which was the final Critical Point of the Race.&nbsp; The race ended with our team completing the tasks first.  Ang swerte ko naman sa napuntahan kong grupo.&nbsp; Late na nga ako, first place pa rin. Bwahahaha!!!   Kom1:&nbsp; Had an exam about the  Wikang Filipino  and the Proseso ng Komunikasyon. It was..a-ok.  Math54:&nbsp; At last!!!! The results had been released...and I passed my first LE in math!!!Woohoo!!!  PE2: Grr...  Physics71:&nbsp; Recit class.&nbsp; Liz and I got 2 incorrect answers...one is for a negative value, and the other is from a true or false question. Oh well...  &nbsp;  There was a Finance Committee meeting in SUMS+UP.&nbsp; I went home with my cousin Venz, because I didn't bring the Paj again that day.  ===  Before I end this entry, here's a picture I got from the Philippine Collegian:     GMA looks so powerful here.&nbsp; Hahaha! Let's just see if she could really achieve her empty promises...  &nbsp;   Finshed this entry while&nbsp;listening to:&nbsp;Duncan Sheik - Barely Breathin'&nbsp;  "I don't know who I'm kiddin', imagining you care..."     &nbsp;

Wu Tang Clan - Say What You Want Remix "You can tell me your reasons, but it won't change my feelings about you..."  I didn't bring the Paj to school today because someone else had to use it.  So, I went to the different buildings in the campus by walking.  The only time i rode the Ikot jeep was when I was about to go to my Physics71 class.  ---  Habang nagnonotes ako sa Physics, napabulong ako kay Liz, "Magsisipag na talaga ako.  The results of the first long exams really did hit me hard last night."  ---  Tumambay ako sa JMA kanina, sa may College of Business Administration.  Ok naman, mababait naman yung ibang apps at very hospitable ang members.  I somehow feel at home in their tambayan.   ---  Naiinggit ako kay  urlLink Jay-R .  Maganda daw ang tunog ng speakers niya.  Basta, feeling ko totoong astigin ang speakers niya.  Makapaghanap nga ng matinong set ng speakers...  ---   urlLink Mae , masaya ako dahil nag-enjoy kayo sa debut ni Bonzai. Haha! Basta kung kelangan mo ng tulong para sa site nyo, andito lang ako, ok?  Hehe..siyempre, basta ba para sa shobe ko..  ---  E kung wag na lang kaya ako mag-Law or mag-Med?! Mag-MBA na lang kaya ako...mukhang nagiging interesado na rin ako sa business at financial matters e.  Hay ewan.  ---  Sa wakas, natapos ko na ang pangalawang pagbasa ko sa Eleven Minutes ni Paulo Coelho.  Sino gusto humiram?! Willing ako magpahiram kasi recommended reading ko talaga 'to.    ---  Before I end this post, I'd like to share some of the pics of our CWTS team when we reported our progress report last Wednesday:    Kinuhanan namin ang sarili namin na kunyaring nagrereport. Tapos na talaga ang reporting namin pero, wala lang, nagkatuwaan lang. I'm the one holding the letter 'V'.      Madz, our CWTS Team Leader.  She took this shot before we left for Katipunan.

       Feeling: Relaxed Now listening to: Christina Aguilera - Dirrty(yes, with 2 R's)  Last night, while I was talking to JM, my friend who's an intarmed student in UP Manila, I asked him what are the requirements that should be met before one can enter UP med.  He was a bit confused because he really didn't agree with me taking up bio and chem units(which are totally not in my curriculum).  I would be completing my 5 math subjects(where 2 could suffice for the requirement) and 2 physics subjects(I still need the lab equivalents for each) if I am to continue my degree in Computer Science and pursue a minor in BS Biology.  I also invited him to see my blog.  He told me that it might be a better idea if I take up Law after my undergraduate studies. He got this idea when he saw in this blog that I'm a frustrated debater.  Here were some parts of our conversation:  Adrian: "E ano ngayon kung frustrated debater ako?!" JM: "Basta, feeling ko talaga mas bagay sayong mag-Law.." Adrian: "E pano mo nga nasabi?" JM: "Ewan..para kasing may aura ka.." Adrian: "Huh?!(Looking dumbstruck) Anong aura pinagsasasabi mo dyan..?"  ---  Basta ayaw ko talagang maging programmer.  Yes, I am interested in computers in general, but not in the algorithms of a computer program.  Hell, no talaga.  Nakakastress talaga ang programming, mind you, unless you're some kind of a genius.  ---  I believe marami namang job opportunities ang isang compsci graduate aside from being a programmer.  ---  Magsisipag na talaga ako.  Haay..I just have to frequently remind myself.  Bakit kasi ang tamad ko..  Finished this entry while listening to: Dashboard Confessional - Vindicated

Started this entry while listening to: The Corrs - Angel "She lived like she knew nothing lasts..."   Okay, I feel a bit better today.  Although some parts of this day were disapponting, I'm proud to say that I didn't take all those negative things heavily.  One factor really did affect my reactions to those situations.  It was a column in the  urlLink  Philippine Daily Inquirer   I've read this morning.  It's about one girl who heard God's voice while she was drinking coffee in her favorite corner of the cafe.  This was what she heard: "The true meaning of life is not being comfortable all the time.  It is trusting that something good could come out of the adversity.  Like faith, it's holding on to things you do not see, and believing in things you do not know."   ---     I think I should stop concentrating on my problems.  I should be focusing myself on its solutions.  And also, these problems are supposed to bring out something good.  I should start believing, and stop worrying.    ---  I don't have much to blog.  This Saturday, all the people who are taking up CS21 would be having their first long exam.  Sana mataas ang makuha ko...

'Cause I'm desperately searching for something real.."  ---  napansin ko lang na napaka-emotionally unstable ko.  isang moment para akong political leader na sobrang inspired sa mga pinaggagagawa ko, kulang na lang e magsisisigaw ako ng kung ano anong bagay.  Maya-maya lang,  sobrang depressed naman ako, yun bang gusto kong lamunin na lang ako ng lupa.    ---  bakit kaya ganon?  may mga bagay na hindi mo inaakalang magdadala ng malalaking pagbabago sa'yo.  kunyari..akala mo maliit lang na bagay yung ganito, yung ganyan, tapos isang araw mari-realize mo na lang na sobrang laki pala ng epekto ng pangyayaring yun sa'yo.  nakakainis yung pakiramdam na gusto mo nang kalimutan yung isang bagay..pero kahit anong gawin mo, yun at yun pa rin ang naiisip mo, sa hindi mo malamang dahilan. iba-ibang technique na nga ginamit ko e, pero parang tuwing maliligo ako, gagamit ng PC, manonood ng TV, makikinig ng MP3, mag-aaral, at kung anu-ano pa...nasa utak ko pa rin!!! pagod na ako...  ---  naiinis ako sa sarili ko.  bakit sobrang dali kong ma-attach sa isang bagay? e madalas naman ako yung tipo ng tao na madaling mawalan ng interes sa mga bagay na walang kwenta sa akin. o siguro...depende kung anong bagay yun..  ---  kanina, imbis na binabasa ko na ang chapter 3 ng university physics nina young at freedman(dahil first long exam ko na sa physics71 bukas), nanood ako ng six feet under.  meron akong isang line ni brenda na sobrang nagustuhan ko.  yun ay: "Once you change one thing, everything else changes."  mala-butterfly effect ang konsepto na 'to.    ---  madalas akong pinaparatanganan ng mga di nakakakilala sa'kin na suplado daw ako.  sabi pa nga ng isa kong orgmate: "Supladito talaga 'tong si Rap!" hahaha... natatawa na lang ako..  e pano kung suplado talaga ako?  ano ba ang totoong definition ng suplado?  ---  minsan parang gusto kong tumigil muna ang oras.  gusto kong mag-isip muna.  mag-isip nang matagal.  at gusto ko munang huminga...huminga nang malalim.    masyadong mabilis ang oras. tick, tock, tick, tock...  ---  sana buhay pa ako sa katapusan ng sem.  tama talaga kasi ang kurikulum namin na ipagsabay-sabay ang physics71, calculusII, at computer architecture and assembly language e.  tama talaga.  ---  nakakainis magkunyaring masaya ka. lalo na dahil inaasahan ng lahat ng tao na masaya ka kasi parang wala ka nang iba pang bagay na hahanapin pa.  mahirap din namang makita ka nilang nakasimangot ka.  tatawagin ka nilang suplado, o kaya naman e sasabihin nila na nagpapapansin ka lang.  --   Finished this entry while listening to: Goo Goo Dolls - Iris  "And I don't want the world to see me...'cause I don't think that they'd understand."  *** //Sorry sa mga nakabasa nito, mukhang napaka-ego-centric ko sa entry na 'to.

       Feeling: Dizzy Current Read: Wala..somebody lend me a good book! Started this entry while listening to: Kimberly Locke - Eighth World Wonder  Last Wednesday, after I, Venice, and Madonna were finished with a little bit of marketing for our sponsors(for an upcoming project), I went to school to meet  urlLink Jay-R , my friend who's taking up BS Bio in UP Manila(and is a block head).  We decided to watch Spider-Man2 at Robinson's MetroEast.  I found Spidey2 better than the its prequel.  There were many humorous scenes, even at the most unexpected parts.  Over-all, it was a good movie and I bet Spidey2 would break box-office records around the world.  ---  While I was studying for my math54 long exam at around 12:30 A.M., I was on my study table, feeling relaxed and somehow sleepy.  When I was about to switch off my bedroom lights, I was horrified to see a creature I never dreamed of seeing extremely near me.  It was a stupid cockroach!  Damn those bugs! They never fail to frighten me!  What I did next was I decided to get out of the room - and get out as fast as i can.  I slowly turned the door knob (the roach was near the light switch), and when I have fully opened it, I ran outside.  I was so tensed and nervous that I never wanted to get back to my room.    I decided to go to my little sister's room and slept on the extra couch there.  I was roused by my older sister at 2 am, (she was about to leave for work) who told me that I could get back to my room because the roach had already been killed.  *Thank goodness!*  I immediately went back to my room and went to sleep.  I have again experienced the effects of my phobia of cockroaches.    ---  Some other stuff:  [] First long exam ko na mamaya sa Math54!!! Waaahh!!! [] Ano nga bang tawag sa fear of cockroaches?!  [] Sana di ako ma-late sa school bukas...damn...lagi na lang akong late...parang si Peter Parker...hehehe! [] Kelangan ko nang tumino!!! 2nd month na ng sem at tatamad-tamad pa rin ako! Somebody save me!  Finished this entry while listening to: Alanis Morissette - Head Over Feet

       Started this entry while listening to: No Doubt - Don't Speak   I really feel that I'm losing my best friend..    Na-realize(na ang hilig ko sa word na realize) ko lang kanina, habang nagda-drive pauwi at nakikinig sa CD na binurn ko, na masarap siguro ang feeling kung sobrang down mo na tapos kakantahan ka ng friend mo ng ganito:   "At Your Side"  The Corrs   When the daylight's gone and you're on your own   And you need a friend just to be around   I will comfort you,    I will take your hand   And I'll pull you through,    I will understand      And you know that   I'll be at your side,    there's no need to worry   Together we'll survive through the haste and hurry   I'll be at your side   When you feel like you're alone, or you've nowhere to turn   I'll be at your side      If life's standing still and your soul's confused   And you cannot find what road to choose   If you make mistakes (make mistakes)   You can't let me down (let me down)   I will still believe (still believe)   I will turn around      And you know that   I'll be at your side, there's no need to worry   Together we'll survive through the haste and hurry   I'll be at your side   If you feel like you're alone, and you've nowhere to turn   I'll be at your sideI'll be at your side   I'll be at your side      You know that   I'll be at your side, there's no need to worry   Together we'll survive through the haste and hurry   I'll be at your side   If you feel like you're alone, you've got somewhere to go,   'Cos I'm right there      I'll be at your side,    I'll be right there for you(Together we'll survive) through the haste and hurry   I'll be at your side   If you feel like you're alone, you've got somewhere to go,   'Cos I'm at your side   I'll be right there for you   I'll be right there for you,    yeah...I'm right at your side   ---  *Haay* Honestly, I've been feeling annoyingly lonely lately(aba, pare-pareho pang may  -ly  sa dulo!). Ewan ko ba... KSP na ba ako?  ---  Tatapusin ko talaga 'tong CompSci na 'to. I swear, kelangan ko talaga tong tapusin. Sinumulan ko 'to, kaya tatapusin ko 'to. Medyo nabuhayan ako nung matapos namin kanina ni  urlLink Maitha  yung Machine Problem No. 1 kanina.  Ha! CS! I'm going to get my degree no matter what it takes.  ---  This month really is a happy month. Let me show just how relaxing this part of the year is:  Aug. 6 -> World Trade Organization Debate for Geog1 -> Deadline for the Tatarin reaction paper for Kom1 -> First Interview in UP Junior Marketing Association  Aug. 9 -> Math 54 3rd Long Exam (Indeterminate Forms, L'Hopital's Rule, Improper Integrals, Conics,Translation of Axes, Rotation of Axes) Makes me wanna scream : "What the @#$%!"  Aug. 11 -> Midterms Math 54  Aug. 17 -> Deadline of mini MP#1 -> 1 am submission at UVLE. -> Presentation day for the Machine Problems  Aug. 18 -> Physics71 2nd Long Exam(I've promised myself that I can't fail this) -> It's JM's birthday!  Ok. Yun pa lang naman. Pero siguradong madadagdagan pa yang mga yan!  ---  Pinanood ko ulit yung Butterfly Effect kanina. Wala lang. Astig talaga ang concept ng movie na'to. Para bang everything's just an illusion. Reality depends on how you think and how you perceive things...  ---  Wala pang panalo ang F^&$%^&amp; Maroons! Nyahaha! Wala talaga 'to...  ---  Nagsasalamin na ulit ako! Napabayaan ko kasi yung contacts ko at medyo tinatamad na akong magsuot ng contacts lalo na pag nagmamadali akong pumasok sa school pag umaga. Hay, epekto nga naman ng katamaran oh...     ---  Bibili talaga ako ng speakers bago matapos ang buwan na 'to. May nakita ako kanina sa may PC shop na malapit samin na 2.1 Creative speakers. It costs a little above P1000. Kelangan ko nito..kelangan ko ng quality PC speakers..

       Now listening to: Lifehouse - Spin   You and I wouldn't change a thing...   Ang bilis bilis ng panahon... parang kahapon New Year lang, tapos ngayon... August na!!!  ---  Nung isang gabi, nagpunta ako sa Padi's Point sa Malate kasama sina JM, Louie Mar, Elaine at Tatis. Masaya naman..medyo na-culture shock ata ako. Ang dami kong nakitang kakaiba(my virgin eyes!!!). As in kakaiba talaga. O baka sakin lang kakaiba, mukhang sanay na ang mga kasama kong members ng ASSOGG(hindi pwedeng i-disclose ang ibig sabihin nito).  Actually, medyo nakakatawa nga. Dapat kasi kasama ko yung isa ko pang friend na taga-QC din kaya lang hindi siya pwede kasi nga midterms niya na daw this week. Kaya ayun, nung nagpunta si JM nung friday sa Diliman, e hinintay niya na lang matapos ang school day ko at sabay na kaming nagpunta sa Manila.  Nag-amoy sigarilyo talaga ako pagkatapos naming mag-Padi's. Medyo marami akong nainom, pero di naman ako nalasing. Favorite ko na ngayon ang Bailey's Mudslide na Chocolate. Nakakaadik!  Sandali, marami na ba ang: 2 shots ng Bailey's 1 glass ng Colt Ice 1 glass ng Zombie(ba yun?) ???  Ang onti nga lang ata nun e. ---  Sayang, di ako nakapagdala ng cam...ishe-share ko sana ang kung ano mang mga kawirdohan na nakita ko.  ---  Naguguluhan ako sa itsura ng UP Manila. Hiwa-hiwalay yung mga building tapos pinapagitnaan pa yata ng kung anu-anong government offices? Naikwento sakin ni JM na malaki naman daw dapat ang UP Manila kung hindi lang inagaw ng ibang gov't offices ang property papers ng UPMla noong war time. Kaya ayun, sa kanila napunta yung mga lupa na dapat e para sa UPMla.  --  We ate lunch at Teriyaki Boy after attending the Sunday Mass at the Sacred Heart Parish. Ang sarap ng noodles na nakain ko! Hindi ko lang maalala kung anong pangalan ng pagkain na yun...  --  Inuwi na yung Pajero sa Pangasinan. Yun na daw yung gagamitin nung lolo ko. :sigh: Mamimiss ko yun... Marami atang nangyaring special sa sasakyan na yun..  Yung Accord muna ang gagamitin ko for now. Ok lang, A/T naman kaya mas madadalian akong mag-drayb. Tamang tama para sakin, tamad ako e.  --  Dahil malapit na ang aking kaarawan, eto't nag-isip ako ng Wishlist:  1. MP3 player, na ipapabili ko sa ate ko 2. Speakers, na hindi ko alam kung san kukuha ng pambili 3. =-=-==-, basta yun. Hindi gamit to. Hahaha! 4. Tumalino sa CS at Math. 5. Maging mas open minded. 6. Makalipat sa LP-net.  ... at marami pa. Hehehe!  Finished this entry while listening to: Alicia Keys - If I Ain't Got You  Hand me the world on a silver platter, and what good would it be with no one to share, no one who truly cares for me..?
