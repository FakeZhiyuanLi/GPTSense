      you see, reading my old diary gave me this sence of belonging, knowing where i am, not feeling lost, floating b/w dreams and paranoia. i felt like i had a mirror and was looking back at who i was and understanding almost and connecting with that person i used to know so well.i felt home for once, in a house i barely knew. i felt sane. i felt like this is who i was     xo~kd

      this is my new online 'diary'.  i don't think very many ppl will read this so i can write the exact truth.. i hope.  Last night my mom and i had a fight.  I always want to kno stuff so i ask her why (eg. why can't i have a friend stay the night tonight) and she think's its offensive.  I don't get it. she also doesn't trust me. We painted my room last night so i had to sleep downstairs in the den. So when it was midnight my mom came in and took the computer and the  remote. even though i was going to sleep! it is so dumb.           I'm going to philedelphia on thurs with my dad, i'll be really bored i'm sure.  My dad will be gone at something so andrew and i will be in the hotel all day till nighttime.

      I guess i'm pretty much indifferent about school starting. I can't change that it's going to come. I love change. I'm not afraid of it like other ppl. I feel that things can only get better in my life, i don't like my past so i hope my future is better. That is how i feel about pretty much everything. Life is never stopping. It always changes, so i guess since i can't change it i should make the best out of it.

       Well, u kno how i told u about the sun night at my house with ellie, when we were talking to tony and tony. Well we were down in the basement and i was about to let my cats inside when i saw this huge opossum eating my cats food. I completely flipped out. I took a window curtain holder which is metal and starting jabbing at the oppossum and trying to scare it away. Ellie scared me more and said that it attacked ppl and it can eat through wood.  So i was freaking out. I swear if i saw the thing once more i would faint or thow up or something. I was so scared cuz it was eating all this and it just looked at us and stuff. I dunno why i should b so scared but i was. I've only seen an oppossum twice in my life and the first time  i screamed so loud the neighbors asked us what was wrong and the second time i just told u what happened....well tata for now

       I'm grounded till the end of the month because when i was in philadelphia i did 3 things. 1) i pierced my cartalige when i only asked my dad and i knew my mom didn't want me to. 2) I talked to tony, who i'm not supposed to for no reason. and 3) i lied to my mom about talking to tony.

       ok, so i've been over at ellies since sat. we watched movies did whatever, had protein shakes, watched movies, and went to sleep about 3am. Then on sun we woke up about 10:3oam cuz her little bro. jacob kept coming downstairs and being loud. At 1 30pm we went to good will while jacob and their mom went to baseball practice. At good will ellie bought me this gothic wedding dress that i'm supposed to wear on the first day if school. I think i'm going to wear it on halloween instead. Then we went home and i called my mom to pick us up. Right before she got there the pizza man arrived and we snuck upstairs to her house and stole a piece... mwahahaha. Then my mom took us home and her friend tammy called and she went swimming at tammy's house. We fixed my room up and talked on the phone to tony and tony. Lots of funny stuff happened that day. BUT i'm going to have ellie write about that in her diary and she's going to make a book out of it. The tony's are very funny. Ellie and I with the tony's is hilarious. The stupidest stuff goes on when we are all together.          More stuff later. byebye

						    On Saturday we went through all the stuff in grandma’s and grandpa’s basement. Including your stuff. Mom threw away a lot of cords and computer parts, but lots of stuff she let us keep. I have a pipe, which mom thinks belongs to the Chief, two Zippo lighters, your diploma, the old ashtray, your grandpa’s glasses (grandpa Jack’s daddy’s), an old ring, your dog tags, a bracelet of grandpa Jack’s that says “JACKIE”, and some other stuff I can’t remember. It’s all been put away into the house we’re moving into in J-town. If you remind in an email, I’ll send the address to you. The subdivision we moved to has a cop living on every corner! One even lives across the street! Even though we moved, I and Shelby are still going to Highland, and Jacob still to Field. This year, im going to be in 8th grade, and my friend Liz has gotten a key to every locker, classroom, and one to the elevators! We plan to be remembered. We’re also getting a new principal. Mr. Hickman… something like that. Our new chorus teacher from last year quit! (Ha~ we made her quit!) So now the new piano teacher is going to be the chorus teacher. Well, that’s all for now…. Love, Ellie
