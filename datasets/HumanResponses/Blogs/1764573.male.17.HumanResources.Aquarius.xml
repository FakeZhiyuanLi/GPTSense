      i wouldn't believe too much about what you hear concerning the "happenings" between my parents, kaplan's parents, and baroody.  apparently one of the foolish youngins of the drumline heard kaplan's and my parents saying they wanted to kill baroody and get rid of him and, as interesting as that is, it is quite untrue.  that being said, i will no longer be in band as of yesterday.  we can thank all those who spread this fallacious and/or malicious rumor.

      thanks much, greg.    i miss far too many people right now (two).  life really isn't so bad; you just think it is because you are weak.   (every offense meant)  right now wish list: pie, You, money.  (in no particular order)  there are too many parentheses in this post.

      Have you ever cried out of complete joy?  Malibu Dream just wasn't the same.  I am complete.  my life clicked tonight and now everything makes sense...i have not looked forward to tomorrow like i do tonight.  many thanks to You for that.

      as "chick-flick" cliche as it may seem, the notebook is far from it.  i would recommend it highly to anyone and/or everyone...so long as you have no aversion to a leaky face.     love is not easy; don't ever believe otherwise.

      Sigh  Where has love gone? Love left, they say Oh, he sighs nothing but love truly matters everything else has become nothing existence loses meaning Why did love go? She thought you were gone another sigh he had gone away a time ago left her behind, it wasn't his choice Why didn't she hold on? Love couldn't wait, they respond he tired of them and their answers leaving the group he had known for years as he walked, he thought about all the good Love had done about how Love brought such elation sighing comes again and then he screamed atop his lonely knoll all were watching him scrutinizing his irrationality his return was to mark occasion all were meant to be joyous and they were, save him without Love, he was lost sigh Love promised she would wait just another broken, he guessed deserted and silent, he sat still atop that lonely knoll waiting forever till Love returned  he violently awoke a dream, a nightmare more ghastly than any other but a dream nonetheless he gave way down the stairs ran out the door stopping only when he reached the knoll Love was there, waiting for him he looked upon her with undeserving eyes thankful Love was still his nevertheless, he was afraid knowing the dream could come to be yet he was glad Love was here now Don't dwell on what may come, he thought Enjoy her now, before sad times come You didn't need to come, he said. But I needed you, Love replied He smiled at her and then he sighed

      i know i've posted this one on far more than one ocassion, but that's because it deserves double- if not triple-fold recognition.  the true power of this tune cannot be conveyed simply through its lyrics.    All Possibilities  All possibilities Are landing at my feet There's nothing I can see But possibilities  All colours are changing in my eyes Your hopes are all fading, that will never do You're seeing the world through cynical eyes I'm seeing the world through the eyes of somebody new Oh there's a hope left, there's a dream still in my heart Look past the answers, there's a chance that there's no rulebook for this love  All possibilities Are landing at my feet There's nothing I can see But possibilities  All the colours are changing in my eyes Your hopes are all fading, that will never do You're seeing the world through cynical eyes I'm seeing the world through the eyes of somebody new  Oh there's a hope left, there's a dream still in my heart Look past the answers, there's a chance that there's no rulebook for this love -Badly Drawn Boy    have an enjoyable rest of your life.

      it's odd how things change so quickly; moving up and down in a most repititious way.  this rollercoaster they call "life" is a complicated one, but well worth the time.  i can only hope that things stop constantly waivering and i'll eventually hit a smooth and steady part of the track.  the never-ceasing fluctuations are sickening at times...

      i'm taking this far too well than most people would; leading me to believe that there is something seriously wrong with me.  it's odd to let go so quickly.    but does pondering on the subject of getting over it mean i'm not over it?

      since my site has apparently been deleted, i'm moving my main site to this address.     work was good today.  hanging out with jamie, andrea, and sarah was fully awesome.  bephauner to you (laugh).  pasta bravo is delicious.  i do hope you all enjoy your collective summer thoroughly.     section 4.93843 of the employment codes of california state this:  any midget (hereafter to be called little person/little people) who had been disfigured due to unkindly treatment by their owners must be able to operate fire extinguishers in the work place.  this includes all little people with lost limbs, extremeties, and bodily tissue.    the maltreatment of pet midgets act.

      today was by far the most 'laughy' day at work i've had thus far.&nbsp; tim (fellow usher) and myself had been effing with each other the whole day and having a good giggle all the time.&nbsp; once we came upon cleaning the third showing of A Cinderella Story, it was "go time" for the dueling.&nbsp; we both grabbed our brooms and had a full-out brawl.&nbsp; i rocked him, of course.&nbsp; using my JKIII/rave technique to "sweep" him from the ground.&nbsp; *AHA!!!*&nbsp; that was freakin' terrible.&nbsp; i then threw my broom at him in a horizontal fashion, thus smashing his shins.&nbsp; *chortle*&nbsp; going to see if the guy was alright, i leaned over him while he was bending over nursing his busted leg.&nbsp; then, of course, he cheap shots me right in the sac.&nbsp; OH MAN, i really did have a great laugh.&nbsp; that was so awesome.&nbsp; you got me good, tim, you got me good.&nbsp;  &nbsp; as for the rest of the night: &nbsp; "never as amazing as you"....i thoroughly disagree.&nbsp; *smile*

      it is going to be heavenly to have my parents out of the house during the trip to indiana; their incessant bickering is really starting to upset me.  in a matter of two and a half weeks, i-along with rhett-will roam the house (the state, really) as freely as i so desire.  if anyone needs a place to crash/chill/party/whatever feel free to stop on by as of August 3rd.    on another note:  the beach is really, really going to kick some arse today.  it always does when you're there.    have a great day young ones.

      this is a song from Garden State; a film being released within the next few months.  i heard it while watching a preview doing a theater check (don't bother wondering).  it is quite excellent.    Let Go  Drink up baby down Are you in or are you out? Leave your things behind 'Cause it's all going off without you Excuse me too busy you're writing a tragedy These mess-ups You bubble-wrap When you've no idea what you're like  So, let go Jump in Oh well, what you waiting for? It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown So, let go Just get in Oh, it's so amazing here It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown  It gains the more it gives And then advances with the form So, honey, back for more Can't you see that all the stuff's essential? Such boundless pleasure We've no time for later Now you can wait You roll your eyes We've twenty seconds to comply  So, let go Jump in Oh well, what you waiting for? It's al right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown So, let go Just get in  Oh, it's so amazing here It's all right 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown  -Frou Frou

I tried in vain to place these flowers in a circular arrangement However, it was incomplete It required that center flower to truly create perfection I want you to be my center beauty To hold all that I am together To create that perfection of life I have desired so long You are that beauty, there could be no other  Will you help create that perfection?  Will you be my flower?   i do hope to find that center beauty and i will no matter how long it may take.

      Ease Your Feet In The Sea  Ease you're feet off in the sea My darling it's the place to be Take your shoes off curl your toes And I will frame this moment in time Troubles come and troubles go The trouble that we've come to know Will stay with us till we get old Will stay with us till somebody decides to go Decides to go  Soberly, without regret, 1 make another sandwich And I fill my face, 1 know that things have got to you But what can 1 do? Suddenly, without a warning On a pale blue morning You decide your time is wearing thin A conscious choice to let yourself go dangling Hovering It's an emergency There's no more "wait and see"  Maybe if I shut my eves Your trouble will be split between us People come and people go You're scouring everybodies face For some small flicker of the truth To what it is that you are going through, my boy I left you dry The signs were clear that you were not going anywhere Anywhere Save for a falling down Everything's going wrong  Later on, as I walked home The plough was showing, and orion 1 could see the house where you lived I could see the house where you gave All your time and sanity to people Then you waited for the people to acknowledge you They spoke in turn But their eyes would pass over you Over you Who's seeing you at all? Who's seeing You at all? -belle and sebastian  (excellent band, you should check them out)

      is tobey maguire actually good looking?  or am i just having a nightmare every time i look at his ugly mug?   the movie wasn't so great...ah, well.  no worries; i don't pay for movies anyway.  for those of you wondering why it wasn't so great:  it is mainly due to poor acting on both of the lead characters' parts.  however, the CG animation is amazing and the storyline isn't completely bollocks so it was a movie you could watch without gouging your eyes out.  i do appologize for my posts revolving around movies lately but seeing as how i have no life (as of now) outside of work (movie theater), it should be understandable.

      i decided that the best way to compulsively spend a hundred and twenty dollars on all three seasons of Family Guy and the first 9 episodes of Invader Zim. both excellent, excellent shows. i'm quite glad that i ended up at border's this morning, that was a good call. woot.  i love me some pastrami samwich.  if only you were here. that'd be nice.   UPDATE!!!:  i got to play with guns...YAY!!!  just like little boys should.  also, the brotherly bonding-both with guns and Family Guy-is awesome.

      yesterday, i stepped on a nail while working...breaking down wooden palettes. then, i did it again...and again. luckily, it was in (almost exactly) the same spot all three times so it is only excruciating in one place on my foot instead of three slightly painful whatnots.  it's way too hot in my house. a fix-it for that would be AC, but that's WAY too easy.  band camp is tomorrow... *LAUGH*   honest to god, guys (bandos), i will miss the good times dearly. immense luck wished your way on the field show.  Napoleon Dynamite can dance like a madman.

      we are fixed right where we stand. - Modest Mouse (also from The View)  not a whole shite-load has been a-happenin' as of late. however, i do have a bit to report. the whole not coming home until three o'clock in the morning thing really does get to people after a few days of it. fully worth it, mind you, but a bit detrimental to your well-being (apparently) and all that jazz. i vow to...well, i don't vow anything because i'm sure that i'll still be staying out late or not coming home at all. the one problem with this change of pace: when life changes again after that terribly short few weeks, i'm going to go into extreme withdrawl. oh, well.  thanks for lunch, greg. always a good time at CPK. i do hope your endeavors in wooery are going as well as mine.  someone needs to be coming over...  *WINK*   well, it's late and i have some not sleep to be getting to. g'day.

      i do have to agree.  the view is quite fantastic; however, it's not quite the one you were thinking of.   The View  As life gets longer, awful feels softer, and it feels pretty soft to me. And if it takes shit to make bliss, well I feel pretty blissfully. If life's not beautiful without the pain, well I'd just rather never ever even see beauty again. Well as life gets longer, awful feels softer. And it feels pretty soft to me. -Modest Mouse  things have sucked somethin' fierce in the past, but, as of now, all of that nonsense is inconsequential.   lee's sandwiches is the stuff; no doubts there.  but, that mayo was pretty iffy.   following the last twenty four hours, i do have to say that this month will most definately be the best of summer so far (as predicted several posts back).   i had a bit of nostalgia the other day.  i saw a piece of something-or-other (paper-like and all)flying out from under my car into the mass of cars behind it.  i couldn't help but think about that animaniacs episode where the best wrapping paper in the store was folded in a most perfect fashion about a beautiful gift.  the person receiving this gift threw that gold leaf wrapping paper away and it was cut and torn (run over by a car, even) until it reached a most poor man searching for something to cover a humble gift (toy monkey with cymbals) for his son.   this made me think: do you appreciate everything you have?

      i don't think i could tell you how much i want you to keep holding on; so don't worry about that.  life is good, and i feel great. - Eels  my thumbs hurt so bad this morning...stupid broom.  life is too short, but high school is sure as hell way too long.

      i have a feeling that this last month of summer will be phenomenal.   the fact that i WILL be having the house to myself (and rhett) for three weeks is a most phantasmagorical thing.   intermission:  the world is in awe of love.  it moves for it and bows to it.  there is nothing that love cannot accomplish.   that was a tad bit paraphrased, but what can you do?  i do hope that the few people who know how to get to my home out in Fullerton/Brea/Whatever will stop by every once in a while.  there must surely be a party at my house with a moon bounce majig with connecting slide flowing into a slip-and-slide.  i think that would be just gravy.  i think a total of three people know how to get to my house and if you're one of them: DON'T BRING STRANGERS (to me) HERE.   i can't help but feel that one plus one really does equal one.  and, if you really want to, you can borrow my four leaf clover.   keep takin' it easy, folks.
