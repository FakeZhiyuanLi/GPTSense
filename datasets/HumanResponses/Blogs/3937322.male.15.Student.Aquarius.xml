      Tomorrow is AGM. Feeling damn nervous. Dunno whether can be Chairman or not. Seroiusly hope that can, so that I can break the unwanted record of people from my primary school not being CCALs or ACCALs in RI. Currently writing my election script . Have a feeling that it's a tad too long. Will edit it tomorrow. Still gotta mug for Maths test (should not be too difficult). Got to install QBasic compilers on all the comps in ComLab 3 tomorrow during recess and Maths test is rite after. Dunno whether can make it or not.  Snore... Feel like sleeping now. Gotta finish my script and go get some rest now.

      Have not updated for a long time... Many things happened... Our PE teacher, Mr Ngoh is leaving for the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board for Bio papers... Sigh, why must good teachers always leave? SS is getting more booooooorrrrrriiiiiinnnnnngggggg. Changed seats today... Made to sit right in the middle of the front row... Sigh... Surrounded by muggers like GG and KL, not like Peck, Woo Han and Zhong last time... Dunno why I am put there. I dun even sleep!  CSC AGM this Friday. I am very excited and nervous about it. Dunno whether can I become chairman? Anyway, inter-house computer science quiz has been moved from 17 jul to 7 aug to 28 aug to 14 aug then finally to 7 aug. Hope there will be no more changes. It also means that I have to miss the POP (Pass-Out Parade) by the sec 4 NPCCs.  Sundayleague is not kind to me... Gave me 2 losses in a row. Hattrick is not either. Made me lose 2-3. Still doing my ex-lab now. At least its better than doing nothing. Replaced the problematic file causing crashes during ET. Hope it works. Maths test this Friday, not good for me at all, cause Coordinate Geometry and Angle Properties of Circles are quite difficult to grasp, especially the Alternate Segment Theorem and tangents...  Big ulcer at the moment,ouch! Just had a fever and bad sore throat a few days ago and then currently still coughing from time to time.  That's all folks! Cyclone

      Hi there, I am just another ordinary kid from an ordinary family in an ordinary school who just wants to lead another ordinary life. Life's just like that. It sucks, I know, always playing tricks on you. Just yesterday, it was very bitter to know that LRT trains do play tricks on you. I thought I had arrived at my destination earlier than another train, but then it turned out that the other train was faster, even though it took the longer loop.   For the past 3 hours, I have been frustrated by this stupid mosquito that might have taken a few hundreds of ML of my blood now. Sigh, but then I just located it and wiped the life outta it with my hands. Another small victory for me, perhaps, in another passsing day. As you can see, its already 2.30 am in the morning. Dunno whether will sleep in class tomorrow?  I was actually invited to this sorta gathering to actually "celebrate" the staying of a primary school classmate as she came back from China for only a month (till Aug). But then, I acutally rejected it. Can't believe it myself. Was I too apathetic? Or was it due to the fact that there were not many guys around there (most are gals)? Dunno, but I do not like to be stuck in awkward situations. Makes me feel extremely uncomfortable.  Tomorrow is going to be another hectic day. First, I think that I need to hand in my complete Chemistry Project by tomorrow, by hook or by crook. And in the afternoon I have to collect NPCC uniform parts at Police Academy and that means that I have to miss another Computer Science Club training again since last term. Sigh, if not for my heavily peeled-off boots and short trousers, maybe I would even consider giving the trip a miss as in CSC now is the chance for us to teach the Sec 1s somethings before the handover of leadership.  That's all, folks! If you did read this and still have time, why not visit  urlLink http://www.aatraders.com/readblog.php?player_id=549 , another of my blog, although you may have to play that game to understand some of the lingo.  Cyclone swirling away...
