      Ok so I just read Emmas live journaly thing and it got me thinking about my perfect guy now I know Ive explained this tons of times to my friends but still I need to write more stuff down so here it goes and my foot just fell asleep sry back to guys ow pain aaaahhh Im laughing now curse it and curse me laughing when I get hurt ok now the pain is fading back to the perfect guy um well first off the most important thing is his sense of humor I laugh 24/7 so this is like REALLY important he has to have the violent type of sense of humor like I do that means he has to laugh when anyone gets hurt even himself or me or random people on the street also he should have some of that dirty humor thrown in too I know that I dont make those kind of joke but I still laugh at them also this may sound stupid but he should swear I dont swear but that doesnt mean I hate it when others swear I actually like it yeah I know that sounds retarded but oh well he also needs to just plain act like an idiot noting that my favorite shows are viva la bam and jack*** this should say enough and for smarts he should be somewhat smart but I still want him to ACT like and idiot not be one ok now on to looks well I always use the term feliks look a like because feliks is just plain hot and if the guy looks like him then hes hot but if you dont know what feliks looks like then Ill explain some other way um his hair needs to be messy or longer not long like long flowing hair but like longer then a buzz cut basically skater hair and I know I know thats generalization oh well and eyes need to be very distinct like special looking or drugged out as I describe some eyes for a body I like skinny guys I mean Im small so I dont like super muscular guys I feel even smaller then but someone whos medium and thin other then looks there are a few more things I have a thing for skaters if you say youre a skater then I automatically like you more also I like guys who are dangerous basically they get in trouble or do stuff others think is bad but that isnt a must also music is a HUGE thing for me the guy has to like rock/alternative/punk/indie/emo/metal and all that stuff if he likes rap then I like automatically think less of him cuz I HATE rap and r&amp;b and hip hop and all that junk I also dont like country or classical I can stand some pop but not much also back to the violent humor thing my perfect guy would also have to be violent like not to me but I love the idea of him getting in fights or hitting others cuz that makes me laugh so to sum it up my perfect guy would be violent have my sense of humor be a skater act like a total idiot and look like feliks and yeah a ton of you now think Im some retard who stereotypes people and likes people just for their looks or image but oh well get over it cuz Im not like that.
