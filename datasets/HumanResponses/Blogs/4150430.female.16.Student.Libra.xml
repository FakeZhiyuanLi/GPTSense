       Does anyone really read this dumb thing?? lol      well anyhow, i am  absolutly in friggin love  with taking back sunday's new cd...im sure you know exactly what i mean, lol      i went school shopping with the mother on (guess what day)...FRIDAY the 13th! lmao...oh it was such a horrible shopping expierience. I spent every saved up penny from babysitting and other odd jobs over the (can we call it this?) summer.   So here we are in the mall...im so freakin excited and i pick out some real cute stuff and my mom rushes me through every store and makes it like impossible for me to be a "bargin shopper" (me only having 300 bucks ya know)...and she refuses to buy me anything!(grr) so heres a girl who for the last 2 years spends a ton of $$ on clothes and shit for school and this year shes tellin me to wear what i had last year and blah blah blah...newho...so i get home and my jeans are to big, my sweaters are to big and some shirts are too small...im like "WHAT IS THIS?!" So i have to take most of em back, lol...(i also got a cute poncho-i like!)   But i got the TBS cd and the Ashlee Simpson cd so i was pretty content for the rest of the night even after a hell of a shoppin day!         Tonight was fun...my daddy came over and we decided to make s'moes on the bonfire so my mom made me and nick go to 7-11, lol. We orderd pizza, made some s'moes and drank. It was interesting i suppose...i had one stinkin wine cooler(which is like nothin) and i swear to god i was drunk(not really)...my brother thought i was insane...i fell off the computer chair and i just could not stop laughing...then i had this massive headache but i kept drinking and got sick to my stomach...took a shower and did my hurr..   yeah i deff cannot trust myself w/ scissors man, i tried to trim my bangs and now they're all uneven and its rediculous...i shoulda left em!    Such craziness...ohh and i soo wanna have a party, lol...like fer serious. I wanna have a party the last weekend b4 school so i can be like: its a "NO!!SUMMER'S NOT OVER YET!! party...but i highly doubt that would happen...unless u wanna bring the beer and we chill in my back yard with the 'squitoes(west nile!) or...we can have it in the livingroom(lmao!) Which ever u perfer.      well im out...nighty night!    xo: amanda

       what to say, what to say....  well these past few days have been hell... i cried all tuesday night bcuz we had to give my dog to the SPCA. We couldnt handle him anymore and even though he was a good dog, he just needed a better home. So despite the fact i couldnt sleep tuesday night, i woke up real early on weds. I kept lookin out the back door window watching Gizmo lay there sleeping...oh man it was rough...  My dad came at 2:30 and i told him i wanted to go with him so i could say good-bye. Nick took it the hardest tho...he cried and cried and i felt so bad... Gizmo and i rode in the back seat for, what seemed like eternity, was only about 20 minutes. He sat there next to me as we watched the city slowly turn to country side. He kept sticking his nose out the window...ohh it was cute. I wondered what he was thinking. I held back all my tears as we drove to the spca...the whole ride there i kept petting him and the big hog kept sitting on me and scooshing me against the seat while i kept gettin fur in my mouth, lol. But soon we pulled in the parking lot and he knew something wasn't right...he started panting real hard and looking all around. My dad told me to stay in the car while he went to fill out the papers...  So it was just me and Gizmo...for 2 minutes...i had to say good bye to the fuzzy little puppy who was placed in my arms as my birthday gift...just 10 months ago...The puppy i had to take outside to the bathroom at 2am...the puppy that chewed up ur shoes, the puppy that ate ur socks....the puppy that loved attention and every time u pet him, he sat down, leaned up against you and placed him paw on your foot....like he was hugging you. I had to let go of the dog that made you so mad at times...but then u just look at his face and ur heart melts.  But how do you say good-bye?? How do you tell a dog that everythings gonna be okay and that we don't hate it and that this will be the last time we ever see each other...  I was at a lost for words...i kissed him good bye and my dad came and took him to the door...  I sat there for a few seconds...the backseat, and my clothes, covered in fur...(he was sheading like crazy). All i could think about was how the last time we were in the back seat together was when he had to get fixed...that was his first night away from home... I remember walking into the vet's office and i could hear him wimpering in the back...he missed us and he was scared. He was sooo happy to see us and i felt so bad to have left him...  Now we were doing it to him again...leaving him...only this time...we aren't coming back....

       Well, i had a pretty decent weekend...      Saturday i got up at my usual summer time: NOON, and went to my cousin Jeremy's birthday party. After, we went to walmart and got a bunch of  school supplies. We came home and cleaned the house then later my mom took us to the fair, which was fun cept i wore flip flops and they got comlpetly soked in mud! (sadly i knew it would happen) But my mom spent like 100 bucks on rides, food, games, and w/e else we got...oh yeah,  i got one of those glow neclaces, HOT stuff right thurr...       Sunday i got up and went to church, then my aunt and uncle came over and my uncle fixed our gutters(what a nice guy!) Then i washed my moms car and cleaned the inside, for free, cuz im just such a nice daughter ya know....hehe. Then theres today...well i woke up to my brother shaking me because my mom called the SPCA and told them that she found this dog and that she needs to get rid of him...which is a lie...for one its MY dog and she wants to get rid of him just because hes too big and to much to handle. Well now im freakin pissed cuz shes droppin him off on weds unless we find him a home...well thats about it for my weekend...oh yeah my toe still hurts...

       Just as my day started out like the usual shit, i thought: "It can't get any worse!"    ....i spoke to soon...   I decided that after dealing with the daily issues of the foltz family, i needed a little break...but i didn't mean literally..         While trying to sit on the back deck to read my book, the dog decides he's pissed and wants to jump all over me and bite me. So in my best attempt to tie im up, i didnt realize that my brother left bricks on top of his doggy house....one fell hit my toe and i screamed bloody murder! I ran...well, hopped, to the house and looked at my toe...bleeding like crazy, swollen and oh so painful..   ...so my mommy (she's the best) wrapped it up and told me that i can sit on the couch all day and my brother has to wait on me hand and "foot". haha. Hopefully it'll heel in a few weeks.       This day didn't turn out as bad as i thought i would.      xo: amanda
