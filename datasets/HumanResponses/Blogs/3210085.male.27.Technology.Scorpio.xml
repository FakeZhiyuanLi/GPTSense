      My worst fears are coming true. I saw a picture on the Times of India which sent shivers down my spine. The pictures were of Natwar Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer in the South Block (India's Foreign Office). The article was on how the foreign ministry was going to be shaped up.  These two "experts" on foreign policy are likely to reverse the 2 most creative initiatives of the Vajpayee government - building a strategic partnership with the US and Israel. Mani Shankar Aiyer, in addition to his duties as Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister will also be "assisting" Natwar Singh on foreign policy matters.  I wonder how he manages his time! Aiyer is an outspoken critic of the US and Israel and "know it all" Natwar Singh is a champion of that Humbug called the "Non Aligned Movement". With the communists as the chief patrons of this government, this is one motley crew that India has to put up with. It is said that the civil servants are like the pillars of a house. If they are upright and strong, the house(and the country) stands, if not it collapses. India has the misfortune of having these two people with attitudes that seem frozen in some other age, in control of a vital portfolio. On the positive side, there is J.N.Dixit. He is the only silver lining I see in a dark dark cloud. We can expect more empty rhetoric and knee jerk anti americanism. Our already testy relationship with the US (I should say the US is as much to blame as us) is likely to go farther south.

      Well, I never! Power corrupts. Or at least that is what I thought. But it seems Sonia is amazingly resistant to its seductive charms. Kudos to her for turning down the Prime Minister's position that was hers for the taking. That position represents the world's oldest surviving civilization and must be occupied by an Indian. I am not sure what prompted her to take this decision, but I am bowled over by it. She is like a breath of fresh air in a country where power hungry demagogues are the order of the day. Like I mentioned in my previous blog, her stature has suddenly increased manifold in my eyes.  There seemed to have been quite a drama outside her house after she made the announcement. A picture is worth a thousand words. The picture of a man with a pistol pointed to his head threatening suicide sums up the congress party for me. That looked so foolish, it was not fit for a B grade hindi movie. Their slavish attitude towards the Nehru family is the party's fundamental weakness. It had able leaders like Narasimha Rao and Madhavrao Scindia. Narasimha Rao was sidelined and Scindia died in a tragic aircrash. But the congress still has promising young leaders, but they are not given a chance.  Our cabinet looks positively geriatric, with dinosaurs of the cold war like Natwar Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer getting key ministries. The biggest disaster as far as I am concerned is that with Natwar Singh at the helm of foreign affairs, we can look forward to unimaginative policies. He will take our country back to the Nehruvian age of (yawn) Non Aligned Movement. All the good work of the last 5 years will go down the drain and we will be back to square one!

      It is said that nations get the leaders they deserve. I had hoped I would never see the day when my country would be ruled by a foreigner. Well, it is here. How do I feel about it? Hmmm... deeply disappointed. Just to clarify, I am not against the Congress party, just against Sonia. We did not shed so much blood for freedom to hand the reins of the country to another foreigner. Although I detest the idea of her becoming PM, I would like to confess that I have a grudging admiration for the lady. Who would have thought a month ago that this would be possible? The NDA looked like it would win the election in a canter. She did rally her party well and took it to victory. My respect for her would multiply if she proposed Manmohan Singh to be the PM. As for my own state Karnataka, I am sorry to see Krishna go. I believe he had done a good job, but was unlucky. Let's hope he will be able to cobble together an alliance with some smaller parties to get back into power. What are the lessons of this election? For me the biggest one is that the current model of development is creating islands of prosperity in an ocean of poverty. This is simply not acceptable. We have to make sure that benefits of globalization has to percolate to the lowest levels for true development to take place. For me, living in the US, it was easy to believe the "India Shining" campaign unleashed by the government. I guess the people exposed it as a farce. But there is hope. The stock markets have bounced back, now that a stable government looks likely. Honestly, I don't think there will be much difference in economic policies of NDA or the Congress, after all, it was the Congress that initiated the reforms. I just hope that the Communists who are likely to be an important part of the ruling coilation will not be allowed to hijack the policies.

      Hmmm, while the jury might be still out on weather Sonia's should be compared to Gandhi or to Mother Teresa, the naked truth is that she is the power behind the throne. Like her faithful servant Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyer said before the swearing in of the Prime Minister that although she has "chosen" a "Regent" to rule, she is still the "Queen".  It remains to be seen if she will allow Dr. Singh to be his own man. Taking into consideration the history of the Congress party and the current state of affairs, I am hazarding a guess. This is going to be one hell of a mess. Already, foreign diplomats are visiting her and she is being briefed by all key civil servants and ministers. If we look at the history of the Congress, never have anyone outside the Nehru dynasty been effective leaders of the party for a long time. So, the whole "sacrifice" seems like a tactical move, albeit a very smart one to kill many birds with a single stone. I wonder if this concept of having a De Facto Prime Minister and using a De Jure Prime Minister as her proxy can be termed as subversion of democracy. Let's just hope that better sense will prevail and she will do what she is good at - cracking the whip at slavish congressmen and leave the Prime Minister to do his job.  Meanwhile, the NDA finally seems to be recovering from shock and awe. But don't start writing their obituary as yet. With the shrewd Advani in charge, these guys are going to bounce back sooner rather than later. With the inherent instability in the current government, the prospect of a mid term poll is not so far fetched.  Let me try to explain why this government is inherently unstable. First of all, there could be two centers of power: Dr. Manmohan Singh (If he has the spine to stand up to Sonia) and Sonia herself. Secondly, the coalition itself is riddled with contradictions. The left parties succumbed to the mother of all temptations - doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. They supported the Congress government - not to help form a stable government, but to keep the NDA out of power. Although the congress at the moment seems to be managing the alliance rather well, the fact remains that they are competing for power in Kerala, Bengal and elsewhere. So, in case of an election, there will actually be no seat adjustment. Thirdly, the DMK and other Tamil parties will try to use the Central government to settle political scores with AIADMK. The question is how much compromise the Congress is willing to make to keep its partners happy. Let us wait and see how long this charade can continue. I am afraid this means instability in the near to distant future.
