      Good evening all!  Seeing that I just spent the last 3 hours customizing this damn thing I think I should start writing something here.  But I have to be careful who I give this link too incase I talk bad about some people they might become sad....hehe....becasue it is a tragic event or people when I don't like them! KIDDING!!! Any way I guess I should just start this thing as a daily journal.  I am not going to do a formal introduction becasue if you have the like to this you prob. know me pretty well or if you don't know me from a hole in the wall you will soon learn all about how wonderful I am.....hehe!  If you don't know me and want to know something feel free to email me or leave a messege...I am friendly....really I am!!!   So I guess I should start with my shitty day today.  I love getting to work at 9 a.m. and have my clueless manager feel the need to call me and to tell me to start cutting people for the day.....HELLO.....it's freaking Saturday.....think we might be busy....hmmmmmm.  UGH thank god I didn't listen to her...as usual becuase we had a crazy ass day...YIKES...I am one tired girlie tonight.  Also it is a Massaschusetts State law that when working over 8 hours one gets an hour break....welll brilliant manager called the other day manager today and told her not to come in until 6 when i let for the day....yes that is right...that means if I left the store then there would be no manager for an hour.....hmmmmmm that might piss a few customers off "sorry you can't return that or an hour because we have no manager to sign and approve it."  However, the ass had the nerve to tell me that i Had to punch out or an hour and go sit out back incase I was needed...NO! If I can't leave the store adn do as I please on my break then I sure as hell am not going to punch out...IDIOT!....Ok ok enough about that.   Anyway that was my yucko day.  So this evening I have just updated this template and now I am just chilling.  I really want to talk to a certain some one **GRIN** but he has gone out to dinner :*( ...how dare he go eat dinner...hehe jk!  Stay tuned becasue hopefully there will be more about him...all I will say now is that he is just the SWEETEST and........he lives in Cali.... soooooo I won't have to leave him in 3 months I will actually get to go be with him...ok no more.  My powers are telling me not to jinx it...hehe!  I'll write more soon.  Cheers!

          My inner child is sixteen years old!    Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       "Streets of Heaven" by Sherrie Austin    Hello God, it's me again. 2:00 a.m., Room 304.  Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war. This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night. I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.  Well, it must be kind of crowded, On the streets of Heaven. So tell me: what do you need her for?   You can listen for a clip of this song bellow in my audio post.  This song is so sad but so beautiful in a sad kind of way.  I learned some of they lyrics before I had ever heard the song because a friend of mine has it in her away messege.  She has a close friend that is very sick with Meningitis.  So I am asking you (any of my readers) to please keep in your prayers.  I do not know her personally but Katie is a good friend of mine and I am sure this is tough on her.    I heard the actuall song when I was drivivng the other day and it hit me that this was where Katie had gotten the lyrics from.  I thought she had created on her own.  I was quite impressed but not anymore....KIDDING...I hope that made you laugh Katie.  But seriously just listen to the song and maybe you will get a good healthy cry out of it just as I did.  (((((((((((HUGS)))))))))))))  ...for anyone who is weepy right now.  BYE!

      Happy rainy night to everyone!  I think we should bottle all this rain up and send it out to Cali.  because they need it for their evil fire.  Speaking of those evil fire's please keep an extra little prayer for Mr. Jelly Beans family.  Those fire's are getting very close to his parents house and well.....I really don't want them or their house to get burnt...so if you could do that for me that would be great..THANKS!!  Today I bought more scrapbooking supplies because I am becoming prfessional at it :0),...hehe. I got this cool rolling cropping center to hold all my supplies so I can take them to scrapbooking meetings...that is once I move.  i figure it is prob pretty popular on the west coast..so I could meet some friends this way.  People will prob. be jealous of all my cool supplies...but I will share! JUST KIDDING well I will share but kidding about the jealous part.  O.K. I need to go make a phone call to a certain company right now.  I got Mr. Jelly Bean a surprise and it hasn't been delivered yet...DAMN them...HMF.    Bye Bye!

      Grrrrrrrrrrrr this is the second time I have written this....HMF!  The first one decided to erase itself wile I was typing it.  Anyway! I hope you all had a good day!  Mine was good...would have been fantastic if my Jelly Bean was here or if I hadn't had to do a little surgery on my knee but of well the knee will heal and 67 more days until I am on my way to Cali...I see the light!!  Hehe!   Tonight I decided to take my stiches out....well I felt like they NEEDED to come out because well frankly...they were pussing. However I had no peroxide.....BUT I did have alcohol soooo I boiled my instruments (my snippers and my tweezers) and the then I soaked them in alcohol and then (here is the stupid part) poured alcohol all over my knee.  Well each stich has two holes....yes so snip, snip, snip ,snip....SCREAM, pull, SCREAM, pull, SCREAM, pull, SCREAM, pull....SCREAMMMMMMMM let me just say those little hole filled with alcohol and OUCHIE!  However,  they are as sterile as can be....HA! No need for the ER...Dr. Beth can do it!!!  OK I guess I should talk about my lovely job....lol....since I am sure it amuses ya'll as much as it does me! So yes I have been out for a week...there was a new manager there for 5 days before I left so I figured when I came soooooooooo I just kind of expected that he had trained...maybe not completely but atleast some what...NOPE! The poor kid asked my yesterday my first day back...."Would you mind training me no one else seems to have the time"  I felt awful so yes I have taken him under my wing.  We get along great...he is gay...hahaha!  Yes long on-going joke with my family that I get along great with gay guys and will have a million friends when I move to the San Francisco area...hahahaha! However my Jelly Bean will be there when I move so I will be happy even if I have no friends..hehe!  Ok ok enough about that ...ewww.  So what else? hmmmmm....oh yes how could I forget I got a new purse today!! It is a very pretty signature tote from Coach and best of all it PURPLE!!!! I LOVE it! Now I think I need to order a few accessories this evening!  Hehe.....I do deserve all of this because I am a Princess after all...hahaha KIDDING!  I miss my Jelly Bean sooooooooooooooooo much.  :0( I think I will go call him now...I wish I co uld be in Cali snuggling with him..HMF  I guess I have to go snuggle with Sam (just SAM no other name included) the puppy he gave me!  Oh yes did ya'll like my audio post...hehe....I am getting to be so techo savvy...ha!  Ok I think this is long enough..... byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

      Turkey Day oh Turkey Day how I am glad you are over.  OK so I think I must be one of the few people that hates Thanksgiving. It seriously disgusts me...it is like an eating frenzie.  Anyway at least my crazy family is fun to be with.  We had our annual Turkey Day feast at my brother's house.  It was really nice to see all my nieces and my nephew (even though some of them think it is weird that I am their aunt)....lol. I must say though that htere were some times when I couldn't stop laughing...my stomach hurts today becuase of it...hahaha..... for example when my parents left....everyone and I mean every one in the house all 15 or so of us lined up to say good bye to them...it looked like a friggen conga line....then my bropther-in-law who never says a word started to sing conga line songs...hahahahaha  I am guess you aren't laughing as hard as I am right now so I guess you had to be there but that will give you an idea of my fam when I call them crazy....of couse I luv them all very dearly.  We then played this really great game "Catch Phrase"  It was a hoot!  I need to get this game! Anyway that was my Turkey day....nothing tragin just a lot of fun.  Yeh I will miss them all  next year but not enough to leave my sunn California!  I am off to work now to deal with the INSANE day after Thanksgiving shoppers.  JOY!!!  CIAO!

They had scrapbookign materials for $1.00 and since I am a professional scrapbooker...lol...I needed to buy some. And I got some candles....I added the Yankee Candle link to my side bar becuase some funny Jelly Bean didntn knwo what they were...and well with my addiction I thought it was very important that ALL peopel know what Yankee Candle is!!!   Hmmmmmm what else. I was just on the Disnney web site....i really want to go.  I was just lookign at my pics from this summer too and I missed it so much.  i cant explain just how much I love being there.  **wining** I wannnnnttttt tooooo gooooo....hahaha!

      Well since I have a few minutes right now while I wait for my Jelly Bean to call I figured I would write a little something ;0)! Work has been CRAZY.  We are having a HUGE visit from the coporate big-wigs next Tuesday and our store is so not ready for it.  Let's just say the floor set that was suppose to be done by Monday is still 75% incomplete.  Another manager and myself worke 12 hours from Monday 6pm to Tuesday 6am to try and get something done becuase the 40 hours of payroll that the dumbasses used on monday morning they got NOTHNING done and when I say nothign I mean 5 people wrapped 40 gifts...it took them 5 freaking hours! Our manager then had the nerve to tell us she had nothign to thank us for becasue we hadn't cleaned up our whole mess....basically she was pissed becasue she actually had to do some work....BITCH!  ok ok enough if that...I am gettign heated...haha.  I love PBK but my god I HATE my boss.  I can't wait to move.  I honestly believe in my heart that all of Williams-S*n*ma, Inc.  isn't as bad as my store.    Moving on....My Jelly Bean is the greatest.  He is so supportive and he listened to me bitch and bitch and bitch all yesterday!!! Thanks sweetheart.  I can't wait until I move.  I am booking my mover tomorrow!! YIPPEEEEEEEE!  It is getting so close I can't believe it...it is really coming true!    Ok I need to go call Mr. Jelly Bean because he was suppose to call me 15 minutes ago...JELLY BEANNNNN where r uuuuuuuuuuuuu!  Night night!

      Hello All.  This week and weekend has been really fun but also a bit on the emotional side.  Yesterday I went to the Cape to get my grandfathers car becuase mine is being shipped to Cali tomorrow.  YIKES. Well leaving the Cape I got a little sad because I am going to miss my dad soooooooooo much.  He is sick right now and I don't feel like I should be moving but I have to go now fro atleast a year.  I am sure once I get there I will be excited and loving the warm sunny weather but I do dread my parents dropping me off at the Air Port on January, 1.  But I will be home in June.  Then lastnight I had a great time out with Sally .....then I realized it was one of my last nights out on the town with my partner in crime. And then to top it all off one of my best guy friends Eric (Capt. Erica) sends me an email from sea sayign he is gonna miss me.  I just hope to god I have made the right decesion to move.    Craig has been here since Tuesday and I don't know what happened but the strong feeligns I had for just seem to have disappeared.  I don't know what happen but I feel like one awful person about this.  He is a really nice person but I think I just love being single too much to seattle down just yet.  And with all my second guessign about moving I just think it is best for me to go out there with an open mind try it out for a year and if I don't like it then I can just move home next January. Any advice here owuld be great.  I am at a loss but I am feelign pretty damn crappy.    It is now time for me to go to sleep. Good Bye!

So in two days that is aprox. 50 hours Craig will be HERE!!! YIPPEEEEEEEEEE.  I am so dman excited I can hardly keep my bones in my skin!  I am not sure what we will do yet...NONE of the touristy stuff....sorry hun..no bar where every one knows your name.  I will take you to a bar where everyone knows MY name...hehehe! And don't worry there will be pleanty of snow left when you get here.  Not much else is going on...been a pretty lazy day.  I have just been watching T.V. and what not.

      SNOW! GRRRRRRRR  I am soooo not happy about this white shit! It has messed up my plans to go to a  Christmas Party tonight :0(.  I wish I owned a snow mobile or a sled and a horse.  However as much as I would love to go I don't want to experience my adventure that I experienced last night again anytime soon.  I went to my parents house on the Cape to do laundry early in the day thinking if I left b y 8:30ish I would beat the storm that was suppose to hit Boston around 12ish...WRONG it started to snow on the cape at 4:00 and by the time I left there was alreayd 6 inches of snow and the roads were a MESS.  I drove 30 mph the WHOLE way home lastnight and it too k me nearly 4 frwaking hours to get home...NOT FUN.  Plus I had to keep my car at 2000 degrees so my windsheild would get hot because snow and Ice were sticking and forming big clumps on my wiper blades....ugh.  So I have decided that doing that once was enough.  Sooooo here I am with Drop, my candles are lit and I am about to bake some chicken for dinner.  I am bored to death....:0(.  I have a case of Sam Lite in the car maybe I should just have my own little party....but then hmmmmmm that might seem like I have a drinking problem...okok I will just drink diet coke. HAHA!   I wish Craig were here it wouold be so much more fun to snuggle up with him and watch a movie than it would be to lay on my couch my self and watch one but I guess I have to wait 3 m ore days....becuase incase ya'll forgot he is coming to visit me on TUESDAY!! Yipppeeeeeeeeeee!!!!  Ok I guess this is enough bitching and rambling for now.  Iw ill prob write more out of bordem later on.  Bye bye!

        You are 'Jingle Bells'!  Full of enthusiasm and good cheer, you are excited by the first appearances of Christmas decorations in shops and have been heard singing along to the piped music.  Your attitude to Christmas is one of childlike delight -  with a slightly mercenary streak.  You definitely believe in Santa (you get more presents that way) and will put up your Christmas tree as early as possible. You really like carolling, and presents, and mince pies, and pudding, and will insist on getting everyone up at dawn to open presents immediately.  So long as the food and presents are good, you will have a great Christmas.    urlLink   What Christmas Carol are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

             you are magenta          Your dominant hues are red and blue. You're confident and like showing people new ideas. You play well with others and can be very influential if you want to be.  Your saturation level is very high - you are all about getting things done. The world may think you work too hard but you have a lot to show for it, and it keeps you going. You shouldn't be afraid to lead people, because if you're doing it, it'll be done right.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.        urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      Here is the post you have all been waiting for..... I GOT A KICK ASS JOB!!!!!   I got an offer from the largest marketing firm in the world to be part of their management training program!!!!  I am so very excited..I NEVER in a million years thought I would get a job with this company.  i mean this is the company i alwasy learned about in college that was "THE" compnay to get involved with but also the company that very few people will ever be chosen to join.  I am not saying this because I think I am the shit.....I am just SHOCKED that I was actually chosen!  So as I am surte you can tell I am much much happier now.  However this also mean I will prob. not be back east for at-least three years.  But now you can all laugh at a typical Beth moment this morning...I had to be there at 8:45 for my second interview today....well everyone has told me how AWFUL the traffic would be so I left at 6 am...hahaha...but that is not the funny part....the funny thing is .....I got there at 6:30 there was not a lick of traffic ... yes I was there two hours and fifteen min. early...HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Ok Ok E.R. is on I need to go...BYEEEE!!!!

      Good Afternoon!  Lots to tell ...lots to tell.  I have never really writtenabout my disatrous arrival here in California so I guess it is time.  It all stat ona very coldJanuary 1, 2004 morning when I loaded on to my America West flight in tears.  They airlines charged me 240  dollars extra becuase I had over weight luggage, my kitten and an extra  bag.  Yes, they may have great fares however they rake you over the coals everywhere else.  So I am on my merry little way to Las Vagas for my connecting flight....yeh itis delayed 2 hours becuase the plane is broken...FANTASTIC! So  I figured with my extra time I would call my apartment complex to ask if my friend could pick up my keys in-case I didn't make it in time.  Well they lied to my roommate...they were not open on New Years Day.....and the catch to that is.....we have been paying rent since December 21.  Luckily I had the keys and  code to my bestfriends parents house so I could stay there.    So one would think ...ok...awful flight things must be gettign better...NOPE...first I get out here and find out I have no job with PBK...basically been screwed over by them.  Ok so I cry over it everynight...no bigdeal.   I will find a job.  AtleastI still have my friends....Eileen(Roommate)...Craig (mr.jelly bean)...Brian(CHP).  Well the funny thing is that i basically know no one, didnt  have my car for a week and a half , didn't know my way around and the kicker.......my roommate decides to stay at her parents for thefirst2 and half weeks I am here.  But it gets even better.  Mr.  Jellybean...yes the oh so wonderful man I used to write about in here....yeh not so wonderful....he lets meuse his computer  to  look fora job.   Yes that was  nice.  However I logged onto my yahoo messanger and WELL somehow mine and his in formation all ended up into my account...very bad for him.  I found out that the whole time he was in Boston visiting me he was talking to atleast3 other girls.  One he even told he was on business in  Boston and new York.... he even told one he was not upset things didntwork out between him and I becuase she made him smile.  Now here is a quote from him that I am sure any girl reading this will just LOVE....."if things had worked out between us those other girls would have disappeared."  WHAT THE F**K!  So basically he had these other girls on  reserve.  NO WAY IN  HELL will I put up with that crap.  yeh he and  I are still friends becuase we live in the same complex...however I feel sick everytime I see him.  Another person that has complelty disgusted me is Brian.  He is such a cry baby  and a  winey baby.  He always says "it has just been a very bad and stressful work week"  and when Isay alwasy I mean ALWAYS and for someon ewho says  he enjoys beign  a AAA-with a gun officer I think he looks for too much of the poor me sindrome.....I also found out he was bisexual...i actually just think gay...I even  have the old conversations from yahoo that him and I had.....hahahahahaha!   Can't get much worse you are thinking...huh.....well I did get a job offer from Spring....NEVER USE THEM.... however like everything out here in the land of F**K me over they did it too.   They called me the Friday before I was suppose to start work on that monday to tell me that they had decided to reorganize and would not be filling the position theyhad offered me and since I had never techincally started working for them I am yet screwed again.  So here I am in California.......HATING it every second of every day and I can't wait for this year to be up so I can move home.  I had met a very sweet guy however I do not think it is fair for me to get involved in a relationship wheni full heartedly plan to move back home in December.  My friend Amy made me realize that maybe I had to make this move to realize how important home is to me.  I  have alwasy been close to my family but I also alway had this desire to live here in  California.   NowIamnto saying that htings could turn around and I  could start to love it here....I am trying to keep an open  mind about it.  However my roommate is very boring andvery manipulated by here boyfirend so we  never go out.  Anyone that knows me from home knows that I was alwasy out on the town with my best friend Kirsten from hom.  She actually cam eout here to see me  becuaseI was so sad...now that is what  a bestfriendis....I luv ya SALLY!!!  We had the greatest time at the bar we went too.  She rode the machanical bull and I took a shot in the  shot chair...yummy,.....hehe  itwent up my nose.    So that is  thelong updat.  I had an interview with a head-hunter today so hopefully somehting  will soon come into the picture.  Until then...I am off to try and make some friends....hehehehehe.    Love,  Me

      WOW it has been quite some time since I have written....sorry.  I have been really busy with my new job! I LOVE it....at least it will pass my time while I wait for my lease to run out here....lol.  I did however meet some really nice  people down at the hot tub the other night.  And the best thing is....three of them are from Massachusetts.  They were really nice....so since we have a ton of alochol left over from our lame ass luau last weekend we are haign them over for drinks on Saturday...shoudl be fun.  Now the Luau we had this past weekend was  fun once I had soem drinks in me and could ignore everyone.  I dont know many people here so it was mostly my roomates teacher friends that were over.  SNOOZE fest  and all they did was bitch bitch bitch about how hard ther job was.  One of them the department head actually said to me and I will quote it becasue it cracks me up "Teachers work more hours in a week than every profession and are very under paid."  So I responded with...laughing and saying "well I have never seen a teacher work a hard 60+ hours and they are not under paid they make $50,000 a year out here and they get basically 14 weeks vacation."  It is a dream job if you ask me.......WELL that set them off with their bitching...I am SO SICK of hear them and my roomie BITCH about being a teacher.  None of them could work the hours or the hard jobs I am most of the peopel I know work.  wawawawawawaaaaaa.  I told them I wanted to be a teacher because I could make the same money and have 7 times the amout of vacation time....LOL that PISSED them off.  Ok had to get that off my chest.....lol.  If you only could have been there to laugh at them with me.  Now my roommate is driving me insane.  I know she has a lot medical issues...however she is alwasy so heavly medicated that it is depressign to hang with her.  The night of the Luau she was fallign asleep talkign to people...then we were going to go out to the bar and she told me all she could have was a soda becuase she had so much medication.  So we just turned around andwent home..She is alwasy talkign about all her pills and that she need more.  Then she is always puking ....personally I think it is because she takes too much medication but one can never tell her that. When ever I mention that my leg is killig em she offers me all kinds of narcotics and she jokes about how much she takes.  She also tells people about it when ever we are out....that is NOT attractive to guys or anyone.  People look at us  weird it is so embarassing.   She alwasy tells me how sick she is...however the other ngiht when all she did was bitch about being sick she informed me that her asshole ex that is controlling and just an all around prick was coming over for a booty call......WHAT THE HELL.  One is so sick that she needs to heavily medicate herself but she isnt too sick to have HIM come over.  I am just so sick of it....I want to go HOME!...LOL ok go that off my chest too.  Haha!  Sorry about all the bitchign but I had to get it out of my system now I am all happy!! I miss hanging out with Sally and acting liek a normal 26 year old.  I want to go back to Mass and hang out with Sal and terrorize the boys...Eric, Keith, and John.  This place SUCKS....but I am not unhappy.. :0)  So no worries.....just lonely!  Ok Byebye!!!

      Good Afternoon All!  I figured since I have been with out a computer for a few weeks I would update you all on my ever changing life here in exciting Cali.  Yes my computer finally died. I only had it two years but I was very abbusive to it...for example...i dropped a 10lb hand weight on it...it was a lap top so that shattered the screen.  I like to think of it as a piece of art while i used to try and use it..I could never have a window opened fully because i couldnt see it all.  Then I tripped one night over the cable cord and ripped it out of the jack on the side of the laptop...hence bending some of the connecting pins...I Ghetto rigged it for about 4 or 5 months.  Also the space bar you had to smash to get it to work ...the shift key was stuck and well you had to press the #5 if you wanted a letter "w" so all in all I think I got my fair use out of it....hahahahaha.  Now I have a nice brandspanking new Dell laptop....my old one was a Dell too but I got the complete care package on this one and now if I drop a 10lb or 15 lb (bc i am getting strong) hand weight on it they will replace it for free...hahahahaha littel do they knwo who they just sold that to.  I also got a wireless cable modem so basically unless there is a 6.7 earthquake and i go flying off my bed, nothing can really rip out of this computer so it should be a bit safer.  Ok moving on.  I start my job on Monday.  The last job I told you all about was a little to harsh on the knee still.  The first six months of the job was pounding the pavement trying to get people to sign up for a certain credit card service....a little sketchy.  They wanted people walking 15 - 20 miles a day goign door to door to businesses.  Well when i went for the first two days i was in a ton of PAIN...pain disorder in the kneww did not like it.  So I called my doctor and asked abotu my knee clicking...welllll he tour me a new one and told me that he RESTRICTED my walkign to 2 miles a day for a year..which of course I ignore but I guess 15 miles was a bit over doing it.  Now I have a new job with a merchandising firm.  And for ayone who knows me knows I love to build stuf....as my roomie calls me "Beth the Builder"  should give you an idea.  Well with this job I will be overseeing a contract with Home Depot and their lighting department.  This is the job I totally wanted when I was in the interviewing phase.  They actually called me when I was out walking my 15 miles and I almsot started crying i was so excited.  Now My dad (Mr. Elephant) wants to know if I get a discount...hehe ....I love him...he is the BEST!   What else what else.....Oh yes I have started taking YOGA!  Now don't start laughing too hard...haha.  It is the best work out I have had in a while.  I LOVE it.  I feel so good when I leave and it works so many muscles!  And now get a tissue becuase this is going to crack you up....I am starting Belly Dancing on Firday!!! I have heard it was suppose to be really good for your abs and legs and god knows I need to work on those areas.  Maybe I will do my debut performance at my nieces graduation in May!!!  Just for you Merit!    Well I need to jet to yoga right now acutally.  I miss you all very much and I have a tone more to say so I will try to post more later.  If you read this leave me a message in teh left hand corner I would love to hear from anyone. !!!  Byebye !

But luckily my bad luck has stopped.....three bad things then no more...yeaaaa. First I had my eyes all gross...then I dropped a steal beam on my big toe and broke it and the icing on the cake was on Tuesday when I passed out cold at work....oops I guess I should have stopped and taken a lil break to have a lemon ade or two or five.  105 degree weather and climbing on ladders with no breaks for 10 hours will do that to ya!!

And the MOST ecxciting news....only a lil over a month until I come home for my visit....yeaaaaaaaaa!!  I got to talk to my friend Eric from home lastnight....it made me wayyyyyyy too home sick.

Moving on with my clutziness I think I broke my big toe at work today.  DAMN it is killinggggggg.  I drop a steal beam on it and with my sneakers on it didn't hurt that much.  However, once I got home and took my sneakers off....YOUCH!!!!  My whole foot is black and blue adn there is a huge lump on it...:0( sniff sniff.  I am NOT going to the hospital for a damn toe though...the freaking thing can just heal on its own.  I don't need some doctore t say to me "Well mam yes it is broken and we suggest you ice it."

He was rushed back to the hospital lastnight becasue of a blood clot in his leg.  He is back in Mass General and has received one unit of blood so far.  Tomorrow they are going to either clamp it, orinject it with a type of heprina dn if that doesnt work then he will need to have a ver dangerous operation to remove it.  I am so worried abotu him right now and I wish I weren't stuck in this godforsaken state...I HATE it here.  So please if you can, just say a lil prayer for him.  If you knew him you would really understand what a great elephant he is!!  Moving on so I will stop crying...thank god I bought tissues yeaterday.  I have been really down this weekend so all I did was shop with all the money I don't have...lol.  I did however get a second job at Bath&Body Works!!!

      Happy Belated Easter to you all....I was too busy basking in the SUN on Easter day improving my tan to wish ya'll one then so I figuered I would now...hehe.  Yes, I know I am beign a brat rubbing in this GEORGOUS weather when I know for a fact that it is POURING in Massachusetts right now...hahahahahaaaa! I was going to go relax in the hot tub and swim a few laps but I figured I would say hi!! Ok Ok I will stop rubbing it in.  Hey I have to love somethign about this place that I am stuck in for another 8 months....!!!  Yes Just 8 months...I am moving home!!!  I HATE it here and it isn't gettign any better.  Yes, the weather is georgous but that is about it.    However here is some exciting news for you folks that have cool looking web pages and blogs.  My very nifty friend Owen who is a computer genious is going to help me set-up movable type once I buy web hosting!!! I know to some that may not sound thrilling but I read all these blogs that rock in design and then there is my lame ass looking thing :0(.  So stay posted one day you may stuble upon some stunning design.  I jsut have to do it on liek a Friday becuase I knwo I will become obsessed with it for a few days...hahaha.....it will have to be perfect you know.  Only troubel is.....when I mess it up...Owen is 3,000 miles away.  Speaking of Owen....I am not saying anything other than you might start ot hear about him more often..hehe:).  This entry is so rambly becuase I have been so bad about keeping up with it...I need to be better about it then maybe people will actually read it and comment....lol.  I alwasy get sad when people don't read here or leave comments...I know I am pathetic..haha...I just need to accept that my life just isn't as exciting as I see it in my own little world...lol.  I bought my tickets for my trip home in June and what a STEAL  $208 bucks ROUND TRIP!!! I was soooooooo excited.  I can't wait to get back to the east coast and some great smelling fresh air...Cape Cod here I come.  I am only home for 5 days :0(.  However I might be home in May for a surprise party for my Elephant (my dad)!! He is going to be 75 he is SUCH a great Elephant I love him so much!! I miss him.  He had a little heart procedure done today called a Cardiac Cath...So if you have a little room in your prayers for him I would greatly appriciate it...he really is the greatest! So if I do come home in May that nifty friend of mine  Owen is going to help me pull off sneakig home by pickign me up at the Airport and bringing me to the party...thanks Hun!!   If you have actually read this far I am sure you want the roommate update.  Well, here it is.  It is sad when a 26 year old decides a good screwing (if you knwo what I mean) Is more important to her than a 21 year friendship.  She was whining to me on Friday how she wanted to go see and early movie because she might be able to stay awake because she is just SO sick (refer to previous enteries)...So we go to see an early movie.....My Prince and Me....great movie by the way...anyway we grab a movie and dinner and are home by 7 on a Friday....How LAME.  So she starts to clean her room fanticly and takes a shower...I jsut figured she is wacked out on drungs again but nope...knock knock knock and up the stairs comes the a** Hole. Now I have nothing aginst her haivng a boyfriend if that is wha he was but it isn't.  He is a controlling freak that turns her into an even more boring person and changes her whole persoailty when he is around.  So her SOOOOOO tired ploy was just becuase she knew he was coming over.....I have HAD IT.  She ALWAYS makes up stories and lies to my face about him.  if we are suppose to be best friends why does she lie so much.  It is sad but it was her choice to throw the friendship away..it just sucks that I am stuck here with the SL*T for another 8 moths.  Now before anyone thinks I am over reacting this is the 6th time this has happened I have given it so many chances and tried everyting I could to save this friendship but it is obvious to me that this Jerk-Off is more important.  All I can say is that I will no longer be there when she come crying to me that he doesnt want to see her anymore...which happens quite often.  She has ruiened every friendship she has ever had over some guy.  This girl literaly had NO friends.  All she does is sleep and watch TV ALL the time.  She never comes out to enjoy the sun.  As you all read before her turnout for the Luau was 2 yes T-W-O...that should explain it.  Ok that is enough of a bitching rant!  Sorry...but I figure if you made it this far you wanted to hear!!  More will come tomorrow but if I keep writting I know noone will actually read it all!  If you do read it all leave me a message you will be my hero's!!!  Byebye!

      Yes folks I am going home in 38 HOURS!!!! I am Sooooooooooooo excited I can't wait!  This weekend has flown by thank god.  Saturday night the roomie and I were being such immature little shits it cracked me up...just like the good ol' days.  We had had a a few drinks and were spying on people from my balcony.  We called security twice for noise complaints then watched people get introuble...I know I know...we should act our age..no need to tell me...but hot damn I haven't laughed so hard since I moved here.  Sunday we went to Ikea!!!  I spent like a hundred bucks...and most of it was on candles...can we all say "Beth has issues"...haha...again we had a blast.  We went out Saturday night...we were going to go to the Saddle Rack but that is in Fremont and there were sobriety check points for Memorial Day weekend and well...we just didn't want to take the chance.  So we went to the bar we usually go to and it usually has a 30+ crowd...which is cool because ya can a have a few drinks and relax. However lastnight...HAHAHA!! I swear it was amateur hard rock band night...I have NEVER laughed so hard at a band in my life...the bands were AWFUL and their groupies that were dancing were even more fun to watch. We left there adn went to the other bar we usually go to...it is pretty ghetto but again pretty fun....sorry there are no quality establishments here in snoozeville...anyway at this bar there was NO ONE maybe like 20 people so we got our drink sat down and were just shooting the shit.  Well then these guys came up to us asking us to play pool.  First...I cant play pool last time I did I hit someone with the ball (plus there was a mirror on the he wall right next to the pool table).  Second...these guys must have been AT LEAST 40 years old..ok ok I know I am going to be 27 this week but damn do I look that old.  So we kindly explained we don't play pool.  Well then they bought us a drink...ok fine we say thank you are polite have a lil small talk with them...next thing we know they order us another drink...THANK GOD the bar tender at this point realized how uninto them we were and asked us if we wanted the drinks...we said NO and booked it out of there. Yes free drinks are great but not from 40 year old creepy men... the bar was closing in 20 min. and I didn't want them following us.  So we left...WHEW we were in the clear.  Or so we thought...next thing you know we are sitting at Denny's Having coffee and they come strolling in....AHHHH I screamed for our check...we paid and left so damn fast I don't even remember it...LOL.  Luckily we live in a gated community and I took the LONGGGGG way home and no one followed me...WHEW.  And then we come to today!  Today was my baby girl, Drop-a-doo's, Birthday..she was ONE today awe what a good lil kitty...hehe.  I should have packed but I took a 3 hour nap, ran some errands and helped my bro for 2 hours find a flight!! So now I am going in the hot tub and then i NEED to pack.  I hope you all had as fun of a weekend as I did.  Night!!

      I am so glad the weekend is here...this past week was CRAZY! However I did get to leave work early yesterday...a whole 2 hours!  Let me see what can I tell ya'll about...hmmmm.  Oh yes I hug track lighting in my kitchen on Thursday night...it is so pretty...our kitchen has a red and blue theme to it and out living room has some red, blue , orange and yellow....anyway the globes are a orangyred with specks of yellow and red in it.  It looks so pretty..however since our apartment over-looks the pool it looks like out apartment is engulfed in a full blaze when you look up to it from the pool...LOL thank god we don't face the fire station.  I rewired all the fixtures to have shorter cords all by myself....all the roomie did was make a mess opening everything...let Styrofoam go every where then laid on the couch telling me she was sorry that she had no clue what I was doing so she couldn't help....UMMMMM hello...you can clean up the mess you made!! Haha...ok no more bitching on that one right now.  I still have a whole 3 day weekend to go before I write a bitchfest!! Not much else is new.  I go home in 4 days not counting today!!!! YIPPPEEEEEEEEEEE!!  This is not a good time for me to go home though because I am REALLY HATING it here right now so it will be even harder to come back.  Oh well!! Ok I am off to the sun!!  Have a great weekend!

      So about 4 weeks back I got a part-time job at Bath & B*dy W*rks...so I went to the two shifts of training.  And then they never gave me hours...just on-call.  So lastnight was my first real shift...and I gave my notice at the begining of it...hahaha!!!  This store is beyond unorganized.  I called them last saturday to get my schedule for this past week...the manager I spoke with told me I wasn't on the schedule...I called on Monday to quit becuase they gave me no hours...however that manager asked if I was calling for my schedule.  So if I had never called to quit I never woudl have known I had hours...haha.  But it gets better...on Thursday I get a call from one of their managers at work and she is screaming and harassing me becuse I didnt call in for my 2pm-6pm on call shift that day.  HELLO I have a fulltime job there is no way I have that availibility and when I kept trying to tel her that she kept say in g "You had a call-in why didnt you call-in" dumb bitch. So I hung up on her. Then I told them I would work Saturdays OR Sundays NOT both...hello I have a life ..this was just to meet people..I also told them if I worked friday night I wouldnt work Saturday night.  So my first weekend workign this is my schedule...Friday 5-10:30...Saturday 5-10:30...Sunday 3-9.  Hmmmmmm CLUELESS.  So unfortunatly I have good work ethic becuase I would just like to quit and never return but I told them I would finish out my last few shifts that they actually scheduled me of. Ok just had to bitch to someone...haha! Now it is time for me to go abuse my discount.

      I know I bitch a lot about my roomie here...well hell it is my blog after all and I can bitch about what ever the hell I damn well please....hehe!!  I need to bitch somewhere other than keeping it all inside and I can't really call Sally, Amy or Owen to bitch when my roomie is right here in the same apartment as me....I get way too heated....lol.  Ok now that I got that out.  On Sunday we went to a lovely and yummy dinner with her parents for mother's day.  I feel so bad that I alwasy say no to her mom and dad when they invite me places but I really just hate being around her durning relaxing or fun times.  She is so depressign to be with.  If everyone is haveing a great time she has to run to the bathroom to "puke" or keep commenting on how bad her head is.  On sunday we were sitting having dessert and she kept rolling her eyes into the back of her head....the key sign of a drug over does.  However it was supposidly that she had such a bad head ache.  Anyway this is where I got my title from....I got a call from her at about 9:00 p.m. after I came home at 6.  She left me a message telling me that she was staying the ngiht at mommy and daddy's becuase they were helping her grade her papers.  This just urks me....she misses at least one day a week from teaching bc she is "so sick" and then she spend atleast 2 -3 nights a week at her parents house.  I wish she had just told me at 26 she was not ready to leave her mom and dad.  I guess since I have been living on my own since I was 21 I understand how to survivie.  On Sunday I was cleanign out whole apartment again becuase she doesnt clean...she also doent take the trash out becuase, get this ..."oh that was my dads job at home" well guess what honey you arent living in "Kansas" anymore....grrrrrrr.  Sorry about all the ranting I have just HAD IT.  Why did I ever more to Cali!?!?!?!  Ok just one more thing then that is all!!!  When I finally got around to vacuuming she opened her bedroom door becuase "her floor really needed vaccuuming too"....WHAT amd I a maid??? NO!!  Ok all happy now!!  I am going to go and try to change the template to my blog with out messing too much up!! I will post a happy post when I am done!!  Bye

      I swear I am the biggest klutz that god ever created.  On our way to dinner lastnight I tripped on a broken curb and land hard on my left knee and right  hand.  The idiot at the restaurant told me they were not responsible; the management company of the building was and that if I wanted to go to the hospital I had to wait until I talked to the restaurants manager today.  So I called her this morning...She was very nice.  She felt soooo bad that the guy told me what he did lastnight.  They are in fact responsible and she had the claim number ready to give me.  So after 6 hours in the ER with a x-ray and an MRI ; I have a torn PCl (the outside ligament to the knee) and a lil broken bone in my hand. The put me in an imobilizer for my knee...I only plan of wearing it when I am walking. The doc was going to give me crutches but I bluntly told him I wouldn't use them so no point...haha.  Yes I know I am stubborn but hut how the hell am I suppose to use them when the palm of my hand is broken...hmmmm I think not!  The suckey part is that I had to miss work today and tomorrow....I LOVE my job I didn't want to not go....grrrrrrrr.   Speaking on jobs, I was suprisingly interviewed to be a district training manager yesterday.  I am soooo excited and keeping my fingers crossed.  I would love this job.  75% of it is travel and I would go anywhere from Washington to HAWAII!!! So please say a lil prayer if ya don't mind!!  Finally.... I would like to say a HUGE CONGRATULATIONS to my friend Kate from home she just had her second baby IT'S A BOY, his name is Jack.  Little sister Gabrielle is going to be the best big sister!  Congrats guys!!  Ok I am going to ice my knee now like a good lil dooby!!!

      SOrry I haven't posted at all this past week....simply....this week has SUCKED and it doesnt seem to be getting any better.  Hopefully the weekend will turn that around but I am not guessing it will.  I was suppose to go to Great America today which is like six flags however the roomie just told me she has to help her mom clean today.  Funny how she doesnt even live at home anymore and she still has to go help clean however she can't clear out own apartment...whatever I don't care anymore.  The other suckie thing is that I realized this week that I prob. won't be able to afford the $8500 dollar move home in December :0(.  SO yeh this week has sucked. I hope everyone else is have a good one.  -Beth

      Ahhhhhh it's Sunday...this weekend went by too fast but that is ok because in two weeks I am having some company two week ends in a row.  First my friend Owen is coming out and then the 4th of July weekend Sally will be here and Owen might me back!! I am so excited to have normal people come visit me!!!   Friday night the roomie and I went to see Raising Helen.....sooooo FUNNY!!!  We even thought it was more funny becasue there is parts about a Lutheran School and well the roomie and I went to school...K-5th grade together at a Catholic School...hahahahaha! We then proceeded to finish off a whole bottle of Bailys in the hot tub....***note to self*** the hot tub will intensify the effect of alcohol. LOL but all in all it was a good night.  Saturday we spent the day at the pool...I knwo amazing she came out of her cave to socialize! We has a great time chatting with some people I know down there playing pool games and soaking in the rays!!  We then went to S*afeway and got our dinner to cook out and stuff for today because the people at the pool invited us for a cookout.  All was great we were having a grand ol' time...however her phone had been ringing off the hook...yup it was the F*ck Buddy...so she ignored it but his new trick is to just show up at our apartment...FREAK! So I hear knock knock...I was like who the hell is at our door at 10p.m.....HIM!  So eventhough all she did was bitch all day how she had to do her grading and how she needed help on the computer...she did NONE of it yesterday evening...I could care less that she is so controlled by such a loser however I stayed in on purpose to be able to help her with her computer.  So she was just bitching how she really needed my help today and would appreciate it if I didn't lay by the pool all afternoon.  I knindly told her I wasted my time last night for her that I would be laying by the pool all day today and then going out this evening.  SO she called her mom and said I wouldn't help her...LOL LOL LOL I am living with a very mature on people.  But I am now off to enjoy my sun now! The cookout is at the pool!! I am brining skewered veggies, fruit and dip....yummy patachio pudding yogurt dip...some chicken and a cake!..lol. I couldn't decide which one I wanted to bring so I will bring all...hehe.

      While home on my vacation my Great Auntie Mary passed away after great suffering.  She is in a much better place now, however it was very painful to say good-bye to her.    I will love you and always miss you Auntie Mary.  You gave me many great memories while growing up, as a matter of fact you gave all of us great memories.  I have never met anyone as wonderful, giving, loving, and supporting as you.  I know you had a tough life and you never let it show through.  For that I thank you for always making me laugh, always dressing and playing dolls with me and teaching me to Irish Step Dance!  Your favorite phrase at ever birthday, dance recital or whatever occasion it was, was "it's your day" well Auntie Mary as much as it hurts to say Good-Bye it is "Your Day" it is your time to rest in peace now.  Please say hi to my Grammy for me I miss her dearly...However, I know you two will have many laughs up in heaven and will alwasy be watching over all of us!   I will love you forever and never forget you, rest in peace I'm not saying good-bye becasue and I know we will meet again someday!  Love Always, Beth Ann

      I have been really good lately about not bitching about my roomie, however I NEED to get this off my chest I am SO pissed off and hurt right now.&nbsp; Keep in mind we have been best friend for 22 years.  Anyway last sunday after our party I woke up at 9:30 to banging on our door...I kNEW it was her F**K buddy so I just layed in bed.&nbsp; However, her lazy ass never got out of bed so I went to the door becuase this moron will not quite he will just bang and bang and bang if her car is in her spot.&nbsp; For example out neighbors called security one night when she and I went out in my car because he banged on our door for over 45 mins.&nbsp; PSYCHO.&nbsp; ANYWAY..... I answered the door and said "she is still sleeping go away. " and went to shut the door. He then proceeded to push me out of the way very roughly and hit me with the door!&nbsp; That day they spent the whole day togeather I was so freaked out I just sat by the pool the whole day.&nbsp; So I told her about this and she says "That Sucks, I'm Sorry." Thats all, do you think she is going to stop seeing him never.&nbsp; I guess a good screw is worth more than a 22 year friendship.&nbsp; Last night she proceded to tell me she is leaving early this morning for&nbsp; Clear Lake&nbsp; for the weekend with Gary becuause they are going to a concert.&nbsp; I guess I am in shock becuse if a guy I was with hit, shoved or even looked at her wrong I would cherich my friendship more than the loser I was with.&nbsp; The funny thing is she met a really sweet guy here at our complex and she tells me that if things work out with him she will stop seeing or being friends with Gary.&nbsp; So as long as she has a man she is happy.&nbsp; Having no friends to her mean nothing I suppose.   I am just hurt thats all.&nbsp; Please tell me if I shoulsn't be.  :0(.

      Ok so now I can talk about my "big news" that I have been hoping for over the past month.&nbsp; Back at the beging of the month I got a random call from Pier 1 Imports; they wanted me to interview for a General Mangers position.&nbsp; I have been wanting to get back into the management role in retail because ...not to brag... but I am damn good at it.&nbsp; So I was PSYCHED!&nbsp; Pier 1 is a growing company opening a thousand stores a year so there is SO much potential to move back east...YEA!!!&nbsp; So anyway I went on my first interview and fell in-love with the company and the job.&nbsp; I got a call a week later for my 2nd interview. I then met with the regional manager.&nbsp; Next step was to talk with 3 other store managers and get to know them...WHEW what an interview process but it made me realize that this company will only hire people they know will thrive in being developed and will grow with the company!&nbsp; I then had to fill out my release for my back ground check.&nbsp; I was figuring I would talk to someone in a couple of weeks becuase I know from coming from out of state the criminal part of that takes a couple of week (and we all know what a criminal I am...hehe KIDDING!)&nbsp; However, I got a call yesterday (wednesday) from the store manager about 45 min away she wanted me to meet her today at 2 for coffee and since I can't work until I have 100% vission I have all the free time in the world!! So I go and meet her and we talked about everything for 2 hours! She has a Disney background like I do so we did a little bitching and comparing war stories...haha! Amy you can understand that one! So I left there feeling really great about the comapny again! She told me I would be training with her if I were hired and that she and the company were very interested in me.&nbsp; She told me I would hear from someone within the next week.&nbsp; I was excited but trying to calm myslef down....a week is a long time to be wondering.&nbsp; So I came home and about 2 hours later my cell started to ring...I couldn't find it "DAMN IT" when I do find it is a message from the girl I met with today asking me to call her. But she said she was leaving for the day so I would prob catch her tomorrow....**SHIT!!** I called her imidiatley...whew she answered.&nbsp; She then told me they wanted to extend and offer to me!!!!! YIPPPPPEEEEEE!&nbsp; Today was a great day!!! I was so excited I started to jump on my bed when I got off the phone with her....LOL!!&nbsp; So I start on August 15th!&nbsp; I gave my notice to Cosmo tonight that my last day would be Aug. 12th....I am sure they wont be too happy with me...haha!!&nbsp; Oh well they had their chance to promote me.&nbsp; Thats another whole entery...LOL.  So that is my news!! Thanks for all the crossing and prayers from those of you who were pulling for me...it worked!!!  Night!

      I was all excited to go back to work today, I had so much to due.&nbsp; I got there and realized I had left all my stuff ( tool box, canvas bag with all my Plan-O-Grams in it...ect.) at the store I was in on Thursday when I hurt my eye so I ran there and picked it up.&nbsp; I got back to the store I was at today and got all my stuff organized.&nbsp; I had my conference call, finished a big priority of my daily routine then decided to go on my lunch.&nbsp; All was going well.&nbsp; I was excited to be back the day was flying by!!&nbsp; So I am on my lunch and my phone rings....It is the HR lady from my companies corp office.&nbsp; She asks me how my eye is.&nbsp; I tell her the truth....(BIG mistake) I tell her it feeling a little better my vision is still off.&nbsp; She asks me how my balance is since my vision is off....again stupid me tells the truth.&nbsp; You shut your eye and try to stand on one leg or walk a straigh line....its pretty tough.&nbsp; So she asks me to call my doctor and find out if he supports me taking at least TWO more days off if not Friday also...UGH.&nbsp; SO I do and he says he will support what ever decision they want.&nbsp; he tell s me he let me go back because I begged....which I did.&nbsp; So I call and leave her a voice mail.&nbsp; She calls me 2 hours later and tells me I have to leave work and that once I am reevaluated and can see better then I can return to work.&nbsp; Has anyone ever heard of an employer telling their employee to take more time off.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I worked at Potter Barn Kids and they crushed my hand they were on my case daily about when was I going to return and why did I have to have a restricted work load.&nbsp; GEESH.&nbsp; anyway I know that my company just cares but my god am I bored to death.&nbsp; A girl can only get so much sun....HO HUM!!   I am sure I will write more later.....bye!!

      So I went back to the eye doctor this morning and he picked a little piece of glass out of my eye that must have surfaced.&nbsp; He also put me on a new ointment with steroids in it...now i will have strong eyes...hehe.&nbsp; Luckily i talked him into lettign me go back to work tomorrow...WHEW I have so much to do and hate being home...UGH!  This weekend was really fun...Friday I just chilled out all day with my eye covered and taking my pain medication ...so basically I slept alllllll day.&nbsp; Saturday I rested in the morning and then was getting ready for our party.&nbsp; I was a good girl and didn't go in the sun at all!!&nbsp; Our party was a BLAST there was about 15 people from my complex and 5 people from work here...we had a blast!!! People were here until about 4 am....the funniest thing was when security came for the second time and said "can you turn your music down a little more because people obviously don't understand that it is Saturday and you can have fun on Saturdays...."&nbsp; So we turned it down a little more and everything was all good.&nbsp; I love where I live because there is deff. a sence of community. Sunday I just hung out at the pool with the same peopel I had partied with!  All in all it was a great weekend!! I was a little depressed and home sick yesterday but I think that was because I was hung over.&nbsp; What ever it was I feel much better today!!&nbsp;   I hope you all have a great week!

      Yes you read that correctly I got glass in my eye yesterday morning...it was actually light bulb residue.&nbsp; OUCH OUCH OUCH!!&nbsp; This happened around 10 and I kept workign till about 3 when I couldn't open my eye any longer.....I had a lot of work to do so no lectures.&nbsp; So my roomie took me to the ER where they decided it would be fun to stick Q-tips, their fingers and a bright purple light into my overly light sensitive eye.&nbsp; OUCH again.&nbsp; They then game she a shot in my ass for nausea because my eye was killing so much I thought I was going to puke.&nbsp; After all the examinations they decided that I need to have my eye flushed out.....a WHOLE bag of I.V. water was squirted into my eye....Luckily by this time they had broken out the numbing eye drops....ahhhhhh heaven!&nbsp; They got my eye all washed, and dressed.&nbsp; They put in some gooey ointment and then a lovely eye shield....at which my roomie decided to sing the Pirates of the Caribbean song....haha I guess I needed the laugh.&nbsp; However, the biggest laugh from the day was....the ER doc thought he should hit on me....LOL LOL LOL.&nbsp; So his pickup like while rubbing my knee was...."Wow you scar really nicely"!!!&nbsp; Maybe you had to be there but it was just too damn funny.&nbsp;   I am really glad it is Friday.&nbsp; We are having a party tomorrow...yipppeeeee!!!&nbsp; Tonight I think I will just be chilling I have been pretty out of it today.&nbsp; I think the boy might come by which would be nice :0)!!   Ok that's all for now....byebye!!

      Whew!! What&nbsp;a kick-ass weekend!&nbsp; Not that I did anything too outragiously special but I had a Blast.&nbsp; Saturday I hung around in the morning then in the afternoon the boy and I took the boat out to the lake....sooooo relaxing.&nbsp; We came home and hung out with my roomie.&nbsp; At 10 pm roomie, boy and I decided we were going to go in the hot tub to relax....YEH RIGHT!! The guy that lived in the town house directly across the pool from mine saw us so he and another guy we are all friends with came down....all hell broke loose....LOL I felt liek I was back in college.&nbsp; SO our relaxing evening turned into us getting kicked out of the hot tub at 2 am....haha.&nbsp; Sunday we slept until like 10 and then packed up our stuff and went out to the pool.&nbsp; Now for people that know me, know I dont normally drink on Sundays but I must have thought yesterday was extra special because when i came stumbling home at 12 am I was seeing 3 of everything....now seeing three of the boy is not a bad thing...hehe...but I had to be at work for 6 am this morning....OOPS!!!&nbsp; I woke up sooooo slow and barely opened my eyes because I was scared I was going to still be drunk and I was sure to keep my pillow over my head just incase i was...but I WASN'T!!! &nbsp; Sooooo HAPPY MONDAY all and I wish ya'll a fantasic week.&nbsp; This could be a big week for me I am hoping....more to come on that later :0) &nbsp; Byeee &nbsp;

      Hello All!  I know I know I have been such a suckie blogger latley...sorry sorry.  No real excuses except for the fact that I just haven't felt like writing....LAZY! Last week seemed to race by and then the next thing I knew it was today :0).  However I have a few things to tell.  Things with the roomie were going really shitty and I just about lost it with her.  I think this may have been because I was crazy lonely last week.  She was either at her mom and dads every night or lock in her room with her buddy.  So by thursday when I made a dinner I knew she loved and even invited the buddy down with the hopes that they would join me I still ate alone :0(.  But things got better as the weekend went on.  Friday night I spent with the "boy"....I know I have gotten many email questions from many of you about who this "boy " is...I am not saying just yet becuase I don't want to jinx anything. However, I will tell you it is NOT my ex Steve and it sure as hell isn't Owen.  As a matter of fact it isnt anyone any of you would know...hehe. Moving on....Saturdat the roomie and I took her 5 cousins to the movies to see Two Brothers it was sad and happy at the same time.  I was pretty preoccupied duing it seeing that the two youngest are 4 year old twin girls and my roomie has no children skills so they both wanted to sit next to me, eventually both sitting on my lap togeather, then they only wanted me to take them potty and the best....they both fell asleep and only wanted me to carry them out to the car...thank god they are little and I am pretty strong.  We stayed for an early dinner at her parent then came home and had the Massachusetts/New York guys from out apartment over for some drinks...and OF COURSE the "boy" was here as well.  Sunday the "boy" and I hung out went on a really sweet picnic and well thats all ya'll need to know...haha! Over all it was a Great weekend.  Yesterday I had an interview with Pier 1 Imports...PLEASE keep your fingers crossed.  The interview went REALLY well, I think. I am just waiting to hear from the Regional Manager to set up an interview with her.  When I spoke wiht the lady who called me she had told me they wanted me to the the Assistan Manager of Visuals when I got to the interview she wanted to interview me for a Store Manager pos.  I was SO excited...so I am just praying now.  After the interview I took a personal day and the roomie and I went to the Great America Amusement park, which was a BLAST.  We need to have some fun I think.    Anyways I hope that caught ya all up and I will try to post here more often.  Maybe if my readers actually left messages....Amy excluded since she is the only one who leaves me love...I would actually be more inclined to write more....HINT HINT!!  Bye!!

      WHAT a weekend...whew!!! Friday I picked Sally (best friend from home)up from the Airport and we headed straight to the Saddle Rack, which is the country bar we love to go to out here...lots of hot Cowboys!! We got home around 3 am and crashed.  Saturday we got up early and headed down to Half Moon Bay which is where Sal went to school for k-1st grade.  It was beautiful down there with the ocean and all.  There were a ton of little farm stands to stop at!! Saturday night I had people over for a America Party!!  It was a BLAST I seriously havent had that much fun in quite a while...some of the guys I work with deff. got to see a different side of me...hahaha!  The "boy" was also there so that was really nice :0).  Sunday I got up and was looking for my presious baby girl (drop-a-doo) and she was GONE....I freaked then I walked into the kitchen and saw the slidding door and screen were open. Sally was already up and i went barging into my roommates room....her friend was the one that left the slider open...he kept sayign all night "this is so annoying that this screen keeps gettign shut just leave it open" and I kindly had to remind the moron everytime that we had 2 cats....dumb ass.  So we all went on an all out search for Drop.  None of us found her.  We were then sitting on the couch about 2 hours later and I swore I hear her crying so i went flying down the stair and lone behold there she was!!! In a rubbermaid crate with a bunch of toys on the patio bellow us with her little head just sticking out crying and crying and crying...she hasnt left my side since then. We then headed to lunch came back and started the festivities again with the guys in my complex that are also from Massachusetts!! All-in-all it was one hell of a weekend and now my liver is in overdrive...hahaha!!  Hope ya'lls your weekend was as great as mine!!  PS.  a note on my Elephant...he is doing better and feeling better....WHEW!!

      If you have a spare prayer or two can you please use them on my Elephant (my dad)? :0( He is a very sick Elephant and I am very worried about him.  Thanks in advance if you have any spare ones. He even asked the doctor if he was dying today :0( THANK GOD the doctor said no but it breaks my heart that he even asked a question like that. I love you dad!

      I know I know....I haven't posted in almost a week...OOPS!!!  I have been crazy ass busy! So I guess I will give a quick recap. You all know I went to the Giant's A's game last Friday.  So I will start with Saturday.  The roomie and I went to dinner at a great Brewery here in this boring town but this place was KICK ASS!! Their Two River Apple Cider (spiked of course) was to DIE for.  We each had two and my god was that stuff potient!! That began out fantastic evening.  We hit the bars and the boy tagged along :0)!  We all had a great time.  Sunday I hung out with my firend Owen.  He is going to have his own post becuase I am PISSED off about him and I wan all of your advice.  It will be a long one.  Monday and Tuesday I just had crazy busy days at work.  Today was a crazy day also but it is almost the WEEKEND!!!  The roomie and I hit the brewery again...they have yummy food also.  However tonight when we are stone cold sober we were off the wall hyper and got a noise violation, well not a real violation but the bad ass rent a cop asked me if i could quiet my laughing down on the balcony.  HAHAHAHAHA the funny thing about this is that we have been WAY more LOUD when drinking and we never get a noise violation...hahaha!  So that brings us to right this second and that is the end of this post!!

      Happy Monday all!!  Did you have a good weekend??? I sure did :0) thanks to some blue eyed hottie! He make me sooooo happy :0). I hope I make him happy! And have I told you he has the greatest damn laugh....cracks me up :0). Ok as much as I could sit here and write about him all night I don't want any of your girls reading this trying to steal him so I will keep my thoughts to myself...or write them in a secret place :o) or you can call me and I can go one for hours and hours and hours if you would like!! Ok I will predict the first person to take me up on that offer....AMY!! She is a pretty kick ass friend...seeing that she is the ONLY one who leaves me messages and she really listens to me gush when in all honesty she is prob bored to pieces...thanks Amy!!  Ok moving on....or I will try...LOL. I got promoted to District Manager today!!! I am just now getting excited about this. Over the weekend and especially yesterday I had made up in my mind I REALLY didn't want to go to Pier One. This is why I got my offer letter on Friday from them ...in it, it said I had to work a MINIMUM of 45 hours and NO weekends off for 8 months...SO not worth it to me. I love my weekends off...LOVE. I love the company I work for but was just fed up with my position...I was too smart to be doing what I was doing and I was getting bored...anyone that knows me I hate being bored. So yesterday I realized that if they didn't offer me the position what would I do. I decided this morning on my way home from Jeff's that I would ask if I could stay on in my position until they were ready for another District Manager...I know it would have been selling myself short but I really do love my company, my bosses, my schedule and pretty damn near everything about it....except for the fact that they made me stay home an extra week for my eye....however they paid me in full and didnt put it through workers comp. so I guess that says they really care about their Employees. When talking with the VP today he said he wanted to promote me 3 months ago but the contracted I originally signed said that all merchandiser have to be employed for 6 months before being able to be considered for a promotion. However when he heard I was going to leave he got intouch with one of the owners and they said he could make any exceptions he wanted to to be able to keep me. So that made me smile. Plus I am the only girl manager so I think they did it fro PR reasons too eventhough my boss swears no...haha! So that is my very exciting news and now I am STOKED. I wasn't too excited at first because I first of all HATE Mondays and second of all had so many scenarios playing in my head that I wouldn't get the position that it has taken a while to sink in....but now I am soooo happy :0)!!  The only bad thing was I went to the doc today to find out I have 2 ear infections but they are already feeling better...the power of drugs...hahahaha. Now I sound like my roomie. That is a whole entry on its own I don't feel like writing now. I just feel like being happy about Jeff and my job!  So good night :o)!!

      Good Morning All!  With all my choices of what to do lastnight I had a very relaxing "me" night :0). First I took a 2 1/2 hour nap....LOL oops. I don't usually nap but I was dead tired. When I woke up I made some very yummy pizza...not as good as east coast pizza but still very yummy. Speaking of east coast food we all know the Chinese Food back their kicks ass especially Peking Palace and South Pacific. Since moved out here i have hated all the Chinese food I have tried...if it just gross out here...they think Panda Express is gourmet Chinese. EWWWWW anyway I had dinner at Jeff's on Thursday and he has a very yummy Chinese food place near him...not AS yummy as the East Coast but still yummy. Ok nice tangent there. Moving on....  After my pizza I decided to do some scrapbooking and I finished 3 pages for my bros scrapbook!! So maybe this Christmas he will actually get it...haha! Then I had some rainbow sherbert, chatted with Jeff, read my book and went to dream land. All in all a very relaxing evening.  Oh yes I almost started a fire! My dad sent me a little stuffed elephant and I had him sitting on a lamp I never use well the dumb ass I am decided to use it lastnight...never thought of the elephant until I smelt plastic burning for a couple of hours then I realized...."SHIT its the elephant " however this burning smell created 20 words exchanged between my roomie and myself...LOL...wooohooo great communication.  Now it is Saturday and I just got off the phone with Jeff so that is where I am headed! Have a great rest of the weekend...I know I will..hehe!  Byebye!

      Happy Weekend!  I hope ya'll had a good week, I sure did :0)! I am sooooo glad it is the weekend though! I have so many things I could do. Hmmmmm. Jeff is bonding with his girlies tonight....Isn't he such a good dad!!! YES he is!....lol just in-case you were wondering. His girls just adore him! His little one has the flu :0( so send her some get well vibes.  So I am now trying to figure out what to do tonight here are my choices....      Build-a-Bear  ....Jeff put that one in my head, now I want to go so bad. Those of you who know me well know I have an addiction to that place.    Scrapbooking  ....yet again another addiction. I haven't been doing much lately but I have a buch I ideas and designs running around in my head. I think I might do some Disney pages. I was suppose to go to Disney Land in two weeks but i will not go away for any period of time with the roomie. However, I bought all the stuff to do Disney pages so maybe I will just make them and save them for a future trip...yet again I am addicted to Disney so I am sure I will go in the next year...hell I will go alone if I have to...hahaha!!    Organize my closet  ....this desperately needs to be done. I was going to do it last Saturday but I ened up going to Jeff's and it never got done....oops.    Hot Tub  ....I haven't gone in...in over a week...YIKES    and lastly....     Hooters  ....This deff. is not a high priority on my list. The guys I work with bugged me all day to go with them. Oh the joys of workign with all guys. Maybe I will strike a deal with them....If they go to Build-a-Bear with me I will go to Hooter with them....haha...not likely. I was suppose to go last Friday but I used my eye as my excuse...LOL. However, I  might  be getting the "flu" so it might just happen that I don't go. Yeh they crack me up and all but look at my long list of better things to do..haha!   So which one/one's do you think sound like the most fun?  Ok that's all for now...bye bye!

      Hello All. Did ya think I was never coming back? haha! So yes there have been some changes to my life since OHHHHH last Friday. This entry will prob. be long so you might want to go grab a Diet Coke or a Magarita or something along those lines...haha...just a fair warning. Or don't read it...but don't be emailing me saying...OH MY GOD when did that happen if it is part of this post and you choose to not read it....hehehe just kidding I am not that grumpy. So I will go in order however let it be known that I would love to tell ya'll about the last thing first because it is ..or should I say he is just the BEST!  Ok so starting last Thursday...I get the job I wanted with Pier One..I am all excited..woooohooo. I call my bosses voice mail and leave him my notice. See I love the company I work for I just feel that I am way too smart to be doing just what I do. I have wanted them to promote me to district manager but nope. Anyway I am still out of work last week because of the whole eye thing. SO, that means I have been staying up till all hours of the night especially on Thursday because #1 I was psyched about my offer from Pier One and #2 I was fuming and in disbelief that my dumb ass roommate( whom we shall refer to as BAR from now on) was actually going to go away with her F**K buddy. UGH! Anyway Thursday night I went to bed at ohhhh 4a.m. HAHA! Next think I know it is 6a.m. and my cell is ringing I grab it because it startled the hell out of me and see the number on my caller ID is my regional VP for my company. "OH SHIT" I think....they are going to yell at me for quitting...LOL yeh ok so I was still half asleep and like I said I love my company. Any way Rick proceeds to tell me Ben (my now manager) called him at 5:30 with the "awful" news that I had given my notice. Rick then asks me if he offered me a District Manager on the spot would I accept it?!?!?!? **BRAIN THINKING** Ummmm HELLO did I hear you right I am asleep and all are you offering me the job I have been wanting? WOOOHOOO! But I play it cool and say I am very interest and that I am open to talking about the details. He tells me he will call me right back...5 min later the corporate offices number shows up on my caller ID. Hmmmm of course I answer on the 3rd ring...cant seem too anxctious. It is now Rick and the President of my division. YIKES!! He tells me that he will be on vacation this week but he would like to have a conference call with me on Monday the 9th with himself, Rick and one of the owners to talk about all the details. So I calmly say "I gave you guys a two week notice so as long as we can talk in the next two weeks that is fine." Of course in my mind I was thinking... YIPPPEEEE!! SOOOO....I am now just waiting and am very excited. They had mentioned relocating me up to Sacramento but I scratched that right away. We decided that I would travel up to that area everyother week for 3-4days. I can handle that but I have finally made some friends here in my complex and I don't want to go all the way out there. Plus after Saturday I deff. want to stay in the Bay area. That was the first bit of big news.  SECOND....as you all know the roomy actually went away with the jerk-off for the week end. On Friday when I woke up I sent her a text message. This message said "I guess a good F**K is more important than a 22 year friendship" I know this may seem harsh but she doesn't get it if you try and sugar coat it and in all honesty I didn't feel the need to sugar coat it. Anyway on Friday I write her a three page letter explaining how I feel and so on and so forth. Mainly telling her that her actions speak loud enough. She never once called or even text messaged me back. I haven't been staying here...this is my first night back here since Saturday and she luckily isn't home. But I have been at home on lunches and after work to take a shower and she has been in bed watching TV and has not acknowledged me. I frankly have nothing to apologize for. So as far as I am concerned I put up with enough from her. We are no longer friends and I feel like such a HUGE weight has been lifted off my shoulders!!   *********************************************************************************************  Now the THIRD thing!!! If you have read this far then I guess you deserve to read about it!!! This is the absolute best!! I met a guy on Saturday night. I actually met him Friday at a gathering some people had here in the complex. His name is Jeff and he is 6'6" and ohhhh so handsome!!! He has the best smile that just makes my heart melt! I met him Friday night then went and hung out with him on Saturday night. I ended up spending the night because it got pretty late. On Sunday morning I met his two daughters that are just the sweetest things ever! They are 7 & 3 witht he biggest ear to ear smile and hearts of gold and are just so much fun...they will also be referred to from here on out as 7 and 3...lol... So anyway Sunday afternoon I came home to take a shower and went back over for dinner because I just HAD to be with him. I spent the night again...got up at the ass crack of dawn and came home for work. I was so happy all day at work but I think that had to do with the fact that I knew I was going to get to see him on Monday night again! The same thing for Tuesday. Tuesday night he made a very yummy dinner...Mac and Cheese and I am not talking Kraft Spounge Bob style...home made Mac and Cheese. He is a damn good cook sooooo if any of you have some recipes I could use to cook for him I would greatly appreciate it ....I have high standards to live up too. So this brings me to today...Wednesday and here I am staying at home....**sniff sniff**... But he need to get work done and I don't want to annoy him and wear out my welcome...LOL. I gave him the address to this sight sooo I cant write too much goofy stuff...hehe....HI BABY!!! I seriously can not explain how this all feels but I feel like I am just high in cloud nine...or like a kid in a candy shop. I could write lots more but it is none of your damn business!!..HAHAHAHA!!! Well if you know me well enough and you want to hear me swoon over him feel free to shoot me an email...I can go on for hours and hours about him!!! So just be aware that you will either not see as many posts from me or most of them will have to due with him :0).   Ok final thing because I know ya'll will email me about the "Boy" well he and I stopped speaking. He wanted me to go mountain climbing in Tahoe with him...**HELLO screws in knee**....So obviously I told him I can't mountain climb so he told me I want athletic enough. Too bad for him I can think on my feet so i told him he was never someone I could marry because I want to have blue eyed babies....he has brown eyes....LOL. He informed me that he couldn't help that...lesson learned buddy...I cant help having my knee held together by screws...haha. But his loss anyway. I have found someone a Zillion Trillion Billion Kazillion times better than him. He never made me feel like Jeff does...so I am happy :0).  Ok that's all. I am off to the store to get my ingredients to make the sweet 7 &amp; 3 some cookies! I promised 3 I would bring her a surprise because she was being sad when I talked to her on the phone...and let me tell you her little "pathetic" look just makes you melt and want to give her the world!  Byebye!
