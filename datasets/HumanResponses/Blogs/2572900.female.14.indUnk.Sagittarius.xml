      10 interesting words u need to noe the meaning of....lol..i find them quite amusing =)  .........___ ........|___| ........|___| ........|___| ........|___| ....__|___ |__ ....\_______/  ..................................................... .....\______/ ......\_____/ .......\____/ ........\___/ .........\__/ ..........\_/ ...........\/      1. Defenestrate: "throw somebody or something out of window: to throw something or somebody out of a window (formal or humorous)"   It is quite entertaining to defenestrate paper airplanes.   2. Garbology: "study of waste materials: the study of a cultural group by an examination of what it discards"  Garbology might be a good career choice for dumpster divers. Recycling may make the job of future garbologists extremely difficult--they'll have less to study.  3. Digerati: "computer experts: people who have or claim to have a sophisticated expertise in the area of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web"   Not too long ago, computer expertise was considered nerdy. These days, many people strive to be among the digerati.   4. Antipodes:          1. "places at opposite sides of world: places at opposite sides of the world from each other, or the areas at the side of the world opposite from a given place"          2. "opposites: two points, places, or things that are diametrically opposite each other"  One could say that Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli and Warren "Potsie" Weber are antipodes.   5. Hallux: "first digit on the foot: the big toe on the human foot, or the first digit on the hind foot of some mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians (technical)"   The ballerina had her hallux insured for $10 million!   6. Otiose:           1. "not effective: with no useful result or practical purpose"           2. "worthless: with little or no value"           3. "lazy: unwilling or uninterested in working or being active (archaic)"  Will e-mail render traditional letter writing otiose? Let's hope not.   7. Cullet: "glass to be recycled: broken or waste glass returned for recycling"  Don't forget to take the cullet out to the curbside, and be sure to put it next to the trash, not in it.   8. Pellucid:          1. "clear in meaning: easy to understand or clear in meaning (formal)"         2. "transparent: allowing all or most light to pass through (literary)"    The police officer's warning was pellucid: drivers must go the speed limit in the school zone.   9. Borborygmus: "stomach rumble: the rumbling sounds made by the movement of gases in the stomach and intestine (technical)"   If you lay your head on someone's stomach, you are likely to hear borborygmus.   10. Embrangle: "perplex somebody: to confuse, perplex, or entangle somebody or something (archaic)"   As Lord Needlebottom attempted to explain the rules of cricket, his American friends became more and more embrangled.

SO I CLIMBED ONTO MIE BED...AND STARTED SPRAYING MIE TRUSTY COCKAROACH SPRAY LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORRO...AND THE THING TURNED AND WENT THE OTHER WAY....THEN....IT STARTED GOING TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE CEILING...WICH WAS NOT GOOD O.O" SO I WENT PSYCHO AND STARTED YELLING...AND SPRAYING,...AND FINALLY THE THING DROPPED TO THE FLOOR....THEN!!!....ANOTHER ONE COMES!!!! O.O" AT THAT STAGE I WENT....MORE PSYCHO...i think it was the first cockaroachs wife or something....AND I STARTED SPRAYING AGAIN...THEN ONE GOES OUT MY DOOR...AND MIE GRANMA TOOK CARE OF THAT ONE...YEH I HEARD MIE MUM SHOUT "DONT STEP ON IT!!"

      I HAVE NEVER...  NEVER!! BEEN SO HAPPY!!!  "The Discussion Board has been removed due to abuse. One of our senior girls posted a timely warning which seemed to stop the nonsense which was going on. Her statements were essentially correct, it is possible to trace everybody that posts a comment on Parranet. Note that when you are in Year 7 your name will be attached to every comment you make. Girls in the past have been placed on detention and had their access to the computers and the internet severly restricted or even terminated. Take this as a FINAL warning! No further abuses or bad language will be tolerated. Use the new discussion board properly or face the consequences. Mr Bryan - IT Manager"  lolz..they thought it was yr 7...

      ok...i had two weird dreams last night...or this morning considering i slept at 3:37AM...  First Dream:  it must have been a swimming carnival or something...everyone- girls and boys went in different change rooms- so we went to change and wen we come back out there was a place where everyone put down all their clothes and SHOES. after that i just see mieself and other pplz who i noe (u noe how wen u get the feeling u noe sombody but they dont actually look like the actual person u noe?) in the pool...then we had to go out and for some strange reason all the dudes were wearing speedos all lined along the pool. and omg...wen i walked out of the pool i wasnt wearing anything O.O" like i couldnt see myslef not wearing anything but i "knew" i wasnt...so i shared a towel with my friend.   when i went and collected my clothes from that spot there was only one pile left...the clothes were mine but the SHOES werent...but there was nothin left so i took em neways. i remember seeing a black/dark blue shoe that had those lil elasticy kinda material on the sides...without any shoelace so u just shove ur feet in and a black "rock" one..the brand. it actually was my old (yr7) shoe type. so i took them into the female change rooms but there was only me a "friend" (the feeling u noe, u noe them) and another friend who was blonde ...i finished changing first so i left i remember saying "im goin meet u outside"  so i walk out the change room but at that same exact moment an old dude walks out too...the male change rooms are next to the female but the male is before ours so the man will be infront of me. the old man walked and i just was following behind then he stoped and turned around. "do u want a lolly?" is waT he sed...i remember very clearly thinking to myself "this is the typical way of lurring a child into being kidnaped" so i sed "no thatnx its ok." but he was talking and talkin and walking closer to me so i was backing back into the change room...where i turned the man wasnt there yet so i sed to mie friends "omg theres a dude coming he asked if i wanted a lolly..." at that time one of my friends had only a singlet on so i sed from the corner of my mouth coz da dude was standing there "omg put a shirt on hurry"...she did and come to think of it the man looked like an actual person ive seen. this man was abusing me and two other friends after skool wen it was real hot and it was the last day of skool. we went into binglee in parra and at the bak there is a big tv and they were playing musik. we three were watching and listening and dancing. then the dude comes and talks about niggas and differnt countrys taking credit for things...he sed the koreans and jap and chinese invent stuff...then he started insulting the music video coz it was a black person...the music was quite good actually..he sed its these ppl who start wars...and all this shit and he sed the music was crap..then we told him no its not its good....and i took a foto of him with mie fone coz if we ever needed to sue him for abuse i have proof he was there...  the person in my dream looked a lot lyk him actually...but that man in the dream was a bit shorter...well he was talking and talking to us in the dream then he left...then we left too...and that was it....very weird...  Second Dream:   it was outside a forest looking thing...a square glass cabinents were there...ok imagine a big square..cut out a square inside that square with an opening for ppl to enter. now the outside square that is left after ur cutting is all glass where u can put stuff inside.. but for some reason it doesnt hav nething inside....  back to the dream...there was a girl in it...not a young lil girl ...a teenage to abt 20 yr old girl...she was an actual person i knew (once agen that feeling u noe her) this time i remember thinking "oh thats andrea" but in actaul fact it had looked nothin like her. she was just standing there writing in a big book...and i walked into the square that that moment. then a dude (i hav a feeling this dude was some movie star or somthing) walked in too. he held me at gunpoint but i had a quick reation and took the gun off him...and now he was at gun point. he was looking at me and he sed "ahah the gun doesnt even hav bullets" so i say" oh relly...well lets try" and i shot him in the knee o.O" and then he pulled out another gun and pointed it at me...i again hav a quick reaction and took that off him too. now i hav two guns O.O" pointed at him....and the dream end there.  so weird...so very weird...

      First, they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.  Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.

      after wat happened on friday... both of them said they dont want it to go back to normal... i dont take sides...so im able to talk to either of em...and they both tell me...they dont want to get back... jen says....you know this can affect the group? i agree...because all of us doesnt have anything against either of them....if one decides to leave or sumthing...it will be hard...  it was really slack on friday lunchtime... we sit where we usually sit...and everyone is there...well almost everyone...nicole wasnt there yet... and then she arrived with angela or sumbody...and with angela theres always cobie...seeing as angela makes cobie go everywhere with her.... n-co decides to sit on the wall on the left of where we usually sit seeing as chung was sittin with us alredy...and angela, cobie, cordell, and whoever else accompany her....  after a quick while...pplz get up to chuck stuff in da bin....and after they get back...they join nicole...and other pplz decide to turn around....like it wasnt straight away but gradually ppl turned around to sit wit nicole leaving only taryn, aira, me and chung... that was really slack....im not blaming it on nicole or nething..because she cant control wat pplz do...and she never asked anyone to sit with her...but they shuldnt very obviously take a side...well not take a side...but leaving someone when they were sitting with them...it showz them how much u really care or such a good friend u are.... chung never said anything...but me taryn and aira feel the same way as wat happened.....  this fight is so stoOpid it started from a stoOpid frikken hat! a stoopid retared pointless fuckin hat. its so stupid...stupid stupid... STUPID....its not even worth fighting over.....nicole was only telling the truth.... and chung goes an take it seriozly.... and tells her to piss off.... so nicole did...and avoided her...chung said she said she had pms...but when i asked nicole...she said she never said anything like that...she said...fine..and walked off...and i know nicole wont lie... just because chung has some personal problems she takes out all her anger on nicole... shes so agressive... they've been friends for...quite awhile... *sigh* if they dont figure anything out for their sake...they shuld atleast think about wat would happen to the group...  lol on monday....someones gunna tell someother person...to *beeeeeeeeeeeeeep* off... ehehe...its slack but no one likes her...and she just decided one day..to start sitting with us...and calls us...'our group'... i personally dont like her that much...like i dont absolutely hate her guts like..lol some person...ahaha but...i am not that...happy..if she is with us ...alwayz... *sigh* everyones having friendship problems...  joyce and aira were also...upset about something....i didnt ask... it's better for them to be willing to tell u urself...*sigh* some other ppl dont seem to have trust/faith in any of their friends....mie friends seem to be the most important thing in the world to me... if u cant trust them...u can trust no one...  ........

      Have You Ever?  Have you ever loved somebody so much It makes you cry Have you ever needed something so bad You can't sleep at night Have you ever tried to find the words But they don't come out right Have you ever, have you ever  Have you ever been in love Been in love so bad You'd do anything to make them understand Have you ever had someone steal your heart away You'd give anything to make them feel the same Have you ever searched for the words to get to their heart But you don't know what to say And you don't know where to start  Have you ever found that one You've dreamed of all of your life You'd do anything to look into her eyes Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to Only to find that one won't give their heart to you Have you ever closed you eyes and Dreamed that they were there And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care  What I gotta do to get you in my arms baby What I gotta do to to your heart To make you understand how I need you next to me Gotta get you into my world 'Coz baby I can't sleep

PRACTICe.. damnit.. its not even the bloody real thing! yeh.. ok.. well i woke up at 4:45am on saturday morning and got ready.. left the house at round 6 to pick cordell and rachel up and had maccerz for brekkie.. then went to skool.. and copied pplz route plan.. coz we didun do it lol.. and then went on the bus.. we arrived at somerset at watever time.. and then we were group 3.. so we left..3rd.. and yeh.. pplz in mie group are: mia, kristine, katrina, kristel, andrea, me, angela, cordell and rachel.. oh and spare.. whos the instructor who comes with us.. we got ms herd and ollie.. damn him.. keeps making us think we're going the wrong way.. and while we are climbing up to some part.. like through some rocks or some hard part.. he stands and watches us.. then.. wen we are all at the top.. he goes and walks this reaaly easy path.. damnit.. if we suffer.. he has to suffer with us.! i swear.. i think hes gay.. but he flirts with all the female teachers.. like if we catch up to the group infront.. he would go and talk to her.. and like.. wen we were at the top of some mountain.. we were taking a rest.. and then he went and started talking to ms herd..;).. and were all like getting ready to leave .. outting our packs bak on.. and stuff.. then mia says.."is everyone ready.." everyone replys " yees".. and then she turns to me and says.." yeh we'll leave wen he finishes flirting with ms herd".. lol.. before we got ollie we got ms herd.. she was really really nice.. and so easy to talk to.. wen we started walking right at the begining.. we went up this pathway following rachel and cordell.. and then ms is like.. come bak.. so we go back.. and then go some other pathway.. wich is supposed to be behind some cottage thing.. so were behind it and making all this noise.. then the lady inside pops out and signals.."*wispering* go up *points* that way" .. and we thank her.. lol..coz i dont think we're supposed to get directions from residents.. so then we wasted all that energy.. on going up.. coming down.. going some other pathway.. walking abck to the same point as before.. and then going abck up the frst time we went.. and that part was probably the worst outta the whole expedition.. damnit.. it was so bloody steep.. and u cant just stop coz there are pplz behind u and they might not be on stable ground...that was probably the most painful part.. mia was leading the way all of yesterday (saturday).. wen we got up to the top.. i think we had to go back down? i cant remember.. like to the other side.. then walk on a track.. and then walk on a grvel road to get to the camp site.. wen we got there.. it was like ALLELUJA!!.. and we started settign up the tents.. it was good after we set the tents up coz then we unpack get the sleeping mat and bag out and get all the food ready.. i looked at the toilet.. and it wasnt that bad.. but it started to stink like reaally bad after a while..coz its like.. a shed like thing.. with a toilet seat glued onto the wooden thingy.. and its just a great big hole...so u do ur buisness.. and it falls right down to the bottom of the hole.. and thats it.. nothing else.. and theres water to wash ur hands in THANK GOD.. and it was really cold water too.. so after we had our tent up.. we had dinner.. everyone was cooking their food.. and we had to bag it if we didnt finish it :| and like i didnt wanna bag it.. so me and cordell went for a little walk.. and i "accidently" tripped and poured it over the fence.. AND THEN.. i heard this voice.. and like.. i turned around and i saw one of the instructers!!! and i was like.. omg.. shiet.. but she was talking to andrea.. even though she was facing my way... and then i just walked away as quick as posible.. and we roasted mashmellows.. well.. either roasted or set them on fire.. but anyways.. i only had two coz i had a tummy ache.. then we went and brushed our teeth .. lol kristine forgot her toothbrush.. ahah she was gunna use her knife to brush her teeth.. but then decided not to.. lol..and lent andrea her cup.. THEn we decided to go to sleep.. in our nice sleeping bags.. that wasnt so warm coz i kept waking up in the middle of the night coz it was so damn cold... and i wanted to sleep.. but like andrea and kristine who was like.. not so far away.. was like talking.. lol .. they're so funny.. and cordell was listening.. and every so often she would shout soemthing to them.. or laugh.. so then.. i cant sleep.. but it soon died down.. lol they hav this accent that they did all night.. lol .. its like.. "hellooww" "HEEllLoow" and thta would go on for a little while.. and.. lol its just so funny.. then in the morning.. we had to pack our stuff.. take down the tent.. and eat breakfast.. lol i couldnt finishe the milk.. so on my way walking.. im like.. "kristine trip me over".. *trips me over*...*"accidently" spills all the milk*... me:"omgosh! kristine look wat u've done!.." kristine:" oh im SO SORRY!..".. lol.. it was funny.. and serina and sabra was just looking at us weirdly.. wen we set off to walk.. me and andrea were just tokkin abt japan.. coz it was distracting us from the pain.. wich was good.. wen we got the gate.. we had to once again.. go uphill.. but it wasnt as steep.. thats wen ollie stands and watches us and then goes onto some easy path...after we get to the top its preety easy.. me and angela was leading from then on.. coz its just a pathway.. and i picked up a stick along the way.. and named it alfred wegener.. wen we got to a point and met with mrs sheilds.. her and her group moved left while we moved right.. and ollie was like.. smiling.. and so was ms shields.. and it made us think we were going the wrong way!! but we kept on walking after checking our maps and deciding to believe angela.. we walked for like heaps long untill we saw these artificial rocks and had a break.. where mrs sheilds group caught up.. then we got onto the road.. and that was the long long long walk until we reached the point where we get pcked up.. thats the place where they drive us back to basecamp.. and we had to wash the pots and stuff.. then we got on the bus where angela and katie sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall all the way to 0 !!! omg.. then they went to -1,-2,-3.. and emilg came down to us and was like.." ok.. we've heard enough.. we let u sing from 100 to 0 and we dont need no negatives ok??..".. lol.. and i was getting sleepy.. we were like an hr late.. all the parents were standing round waiting.. lol mr.dunbar picked me and rachel up and we went to maccers to get icecream.. the chicks infront of us were looking at us weirdly.. mayb coz we were like in shorts and t-shirt and rachel had a hat on... and others were like in jumpoers and jeans and stuff.. lol oh wellz.. they were least of our worries.. then i got to go home.. and collapsed onto the floor.. =) never felt to glad to be home..   after all the pain and suffereing we went through.. i think we all had heaps of fun ^_^.. lol after this week of skool.. we would ahv spent a whole 12 days with each other.. lol..  i got tkd tomoroz.. and im in so much pain.. i havnt even done any of mie hw.. but i can always do it someother time i gues...  i think i've bloged enough.. no ones gonna wanna read all of it =) lol..  bye bye

"dont just place ur kick or place ur punch.. we all have someone we hate.. if u dont.. then imagine me.. put my face there.. we dont place a kick at someone we hate.. hit them as if u mean it.. put power into it.. blah blah" and.. we did this thing.. were we.. were A side face B side again.. and i was wit cordell.. next to the twins.. and were at opposite ends of the hall.. there stretch one of their arms out.. and we gotta run.. and do jumpin side kick.. me and rachel were like.. somewhat confused at first.. then ins.mike was like.. i'll show u girls.. hold on.. just watch the twins for now.. so we watched... and then just did wat dey did.. and yeh i got cordellz hand.. which is supposed 2 b the head of the person.. and yeh.. we then had to do.. jumpin front kick.. so we had to run towards our partner.. and aim for the hand which is in front of her.. so i was doing that.. and i missed.. then i nearly poked mie eye.. on her hand.. and we kept laughing.. and ins.mike iz like.. "no laughing! wats so funny abt kicking someone in the head?!".. so we had to be quiet..   we had to do like continuous side kicks.. and we were watching the twins before we did anything.. and then.. grace goes.. u go.. and isobel goes.. no u go.. ahaha it waz so funni.. they acted like kids.. lol.. they're really nice..   ooo.. the fun part was.. wen we got split into 4 teams.. according to our belts of course.. so me cordell rachel and george.. got isobel as our instructor for our pattern.. which is still the four directional punch.. she went over it with us.. lots of times.. and then.. we didun noe wat waz going on.. he got us to stand in a line facing inwards.. so we did.. and hez like.. theres onli one winner and 3 losers.. whoever wins gets to watch everyone else do 20 push ups...he called the green belts i think.. to do their pattern.. and we all watched.. then they went bak into the line.. then it was us.. we did both left and right.. and then went bak.. isobel wispered to me.. i think we might win this.. and then it was the red belts.. and then it was the yellow + yellow tips..   and.. wen everyone finished.. he goes.. do u want places or just winner and losers with 20 push ups.. and everyone said places.. and hes laughing and says.. no one likes pushups.. and WE WON.. so hez like.. everyone down.. 20 push ups.. and u can enjoy this.. *saying to us*.. then rachel says.. ahaha we can watch and laugh.. then isobel wispers.. dont dont.. he'll make u do 20 push ups too.. so we didun laugh.. lol..   we then did... self defence! yay! mie fav part.. i got rachel as mie partner wen we were doing that.. and we did the hand thing.. he came to me.. grabed mie wrist.. and i got out of it.. it waz really easy.. then.. we did this.. grabbing arm one.. where u get their pressure point then put ur hand on their elbow and push em down to the floor.. then we did this one.. where someone comes up to u and grabs u at the front.. and u press em in the eye.. and rachel was like slow motionly grabbing mie uniform.. then ins.mike walks past.. moves her away.. and full grabs me.. then im tryna poke his eyes.. but hez kinda movin meeh... and he told us not to actually touch the eyes.. but on top.. so i was like.. on his forhead.. like eyebrows.. and hez like no.. closer.. so i was like.. kinda closer.. and hez like yeh.. and let me go..&nbsp; lol wen i waz practicing wit rachel..   rachel: .. ok.. so i grab u.. *slowly gets mie uniform*.. me: yep.. ok.. and i poke u in the eye.. *slowly puts hand on eye area.. ended up on the eyebrows.." rachel: *talkin in gay voice* oh no! u wrecked mie eyebrows.. now i gotta do them agen..

      heyo there..   lol.. i am going to talk abt mie wonderful tae kwon do lesson =D...  ok.. i was waiting around for rachel to come pick me up.. and i hear their car.. so i open da door.. and its dark and raining and i havnt got mie glasses on.. so i was.. confused.. coz i wasnt sure if it waz them or not.. so wen i got close to da car.. i opened da door.. and rachelz like.. "gee.. u looked lost..".. lol..   we arrived at tkd.. bowed at the door before entering.. out out belts on.. went around and bowed to everyone higher rank than us.. and then did some stretches.. we stretched a bit.. then instructer michael.. told us to move in.. and we began our lesson.. we do wat we usually do.. like stretch.. ankle.. knees.. hips.. shoulders.. neck.. and then he tells us to do stuff.. like.. i dno.. lower section block.. midsection kick.. watever.. cant remember.. but that boring stuff.. then.. we had to spar.. abit.. but only 3 step sparring.. just kinda.. slow.. blocking stuff.. and then.. we had to do stretching.. like.. "a side face b side.. b side down.. a side left leg up".. we put our leg on their shoulder.. and yeh they stand up.. blah blah.. wen i waz sparring rachel.. ins. mike moved her away.. he doesnt like white belts with white belts.. damn him.. but i got fred so it waz good.. hez really nice.. lol.. and he asked abt mie earings o_O.. he goes.. "ur earings.. dice.. ive never seen dice before.. ive seen crocodiles.. but not dice.. " and im like.. "gee.. u look at earings often?".. and he goes.." nah.. just its big.. and u notice.." and im like.. "ahah.. ok... ." and then he goes.." how come ones white and ones black?".. and i go.. "coz i wanted some contrast... .." hez like.." oh ok.. ive seen olympic earings too.. they were lil rings.. ".. and im like.." wow.. somepplz are obsessed..".. so we had a whole discussion on earings.. lol.. aahhaa.. quite intersting..   after stretching.. we did some more sparring.. then.. we moved in.. as in.. all da higher pplz go to da front.. and then.. he got us to do our pattern.. and ttthheen.. he got a side to face b side again.. and do some more sparring.. i was next to rachel agen.. so he moved her.. and said.. its got to spar different ppl.. and i got natasha.. we had to do kinky stretches.. and i was with rachel for that.. i need to practice more.. dont really have a good stretch..   we basicly sparred.. stretched.. patterns.. sparred... sparred.. patterns.. strtch.. sparred.. sparred..   the interesting part got to the free spar.. well it wasnt that interesing but wen he mad everyone take 10 steps back so were on opposite sides of the hall.. and made one of us run up to the other or meet in the middle or watever.. it was kool.. i had ins. mike for that.. weird.. he jsut full charged at me.. and i was like.. wtf.. and hez like.. ur allowed to touch me.. go on.. go.. kick me.. go.. punch.. and i was like.. trying to.. but hez moving.. and.. yeh.. everyone tellz me i have to relax.. damnit.. wats wrong with focussing.. i moved on to dominic... hez sooooo tall.. and hez like.. hit me.. i dont care.. if i get hurt its my fault.. so im just punchin and kicking.. lalala.. and i move on to fred.. lol.. he goez 2 me.. touch me.. i dont care.. it wont hurt.. and if it does its my fault.. u can kick me.. just not my balls.. lol ahaha.. so im kicking.. tryna punch.. and hez like.. hit me.. ok.. hit my arm.. and im like.. do i have to?.. and he goes.. yes.. so i punch.. and hez like harder.. so i punch agen.. harder.. punch.. harder.. punch.. hmm.. harder.. PUNCH.. yeh.. hit me like that.. i dont care.. just not my balls i told u that.. ahaha i was just laffing.. coz he kept telling me to hit him and then saying.. just not my balls at the end.. so i kicked and punched and everything.. then.. i got him in the head =S.. not good..   i moved onto nazza.. i think thats her name.. ins. mike changed the thing.. we started some self defence kinda thing.. like.. in da streets.. some dude comes up and pushes u.. and then he said.. most pplz act smart and are like cmon lets fight.. and put their heads forward.. and drop their hands.. let them walk abt 3 steps then..*wham* straight for the head.. 90%of the time u'll knock em out.. so he got the seniors to drop their guard.. and wen i got nazza.. she started sparring.. and im like..eh.. i think ur supposed 2 drop ur guard and "taunt me".. lol.. aahah so shes like ooh.. are we? ok then.. OoOOoOo bring it on.. cmon..&nbsp; .. ahah lol and i was just laughing and i actually hit her in the head.. by accident.. and shes like.. oohhh ur good.. lol..   i moved onto this other lady.. she was alrite.. didun do much in teaching me.. but told me to keept moving.. then i got.. isobel or grace.. thing it was isobel.. anyways.. ins. mike changed the thing agen.. and said.. most pplz r taller than u.. dont think thats a disadvantage.. coz all u gotta do is jump and then punch.. so i had to try that on isobel while we were sparring.. coz i had to wait for them to drop their guards.. and i gotta jump and punch.. and shes way taller than me.. so i was trying.. and yeh.. we then did actual self defence.. now this is the interesting part..   ins. mike goes.. "ok.. anyone have any questions?".. noone says anything.. "ok so if i hold u in any lock u wuld be able to get out of it?" no one says anuthing..  *walks through the middle* *points at rachel* "im going to pick on u.. u didun have a question.. u gotta have a voice in this class.."  *has rachel in a headlock* "what do u do?"... *rachel does nothing*..  *ins.mike lets go* "u have 3 seconds to save urself.." *ins.mike walks throo middle agen* *points at me* "u didun ask any questions either.." *has me in a headlock* (i remembered wat natasha told me abt the lessons i was away.. u put ur chin down so they cant choke u..)  *puts chin down..* makes no difference* so i.. lifted mie arm up to punch him.. and like i didun mean to actually HIT him.. but coz i culdnt see his head.. being ina headlock and all.. i accidently hit him in the jaw... or chin.. or cheek.. or face.. i dont know.. but yeh.. lol..  *he lets go*.. lol everyones just laughing.. and he goes.. "that COULD work.. but i woulda broke ur neck.." *has me in headlock agen* "step on my foot" *steps on his foot* *he lets go..*  lol..ahaha so i punched ins.mike in the face.. ANYWAYZ.. we did more self defence work like pressure point on hand, underarm, how ta pinch pplz... lol.. so funii.. i had isobel right.. so shes tryna find mie pressure point on mie hand.. and shes like.. iz it hurting?.. and i culdnt feel anything.. and wen i culd.. u twist the wrist.. and push it back.. and break it.. i had to demonstrate that for mike.. he walked past and was like.. who punched me b4? ahh u.. grab me.. so i did.. and he gets mie pressure point .. twists mie wrist hard.. and then full pushes it back.. and im like.. ow ow ow.. evil bastard.. lol.. after that.. we had this other one.. where we pinch on thier back.. like big chunks of flesh and twist.. or lil bits.. so isobel is like.. ok.. we're at a party.. and im a guy checkin u out.. and im gna come and hug u.. lmao.. shes actin all drunk.. and gives me this big hug.. then i have to grab bits on her bak.. and pinch till she lets go.. lol.. it was so funny.. tthen.. we had pressure point in the armpit.. and we couldnt find it.. like i grabed her.. and shes tryna find it.. and i let go.. and shes like.. did it hurt or u just ticklish??.. lol ahaha it was ticklish... then mikes like.. anyone cant do that put ur hand up.. so i put mie hand up.. and isobels like.. dont put ur hand up!.. but then he came.. and she asked him where the hand pressure point was.. and hez like.. u serioz? u dno this?.. and isobelz like.. yeh.. i havnt done this.. so he shows her.. then grace.. goes..where is it? and hez like u dont know this?!.. and shes like no.. and wen he left.. isobels like.. geeez.. he expects us to know everything.. and im like yeh.. just coz ur blackbelts.. lol.. wen ins.mike needed to demonstrate somethign else.. he walked pass me and goes.. im not picking u.. ur an animal.. lol.. ahahha.. ahha.. lol.. i like self defence the best..  we did some stretching and some patterns.. then we finished..  tkd is fun wen u dont spar like crazy..   i got period 1 tomoro.. damn jap lesson..   anywhoz.. bb.

      elloz..   monday:  cordell came over at abt 8:30am.. and shez full stressing about some certain someone coz we were gonna go to their skool to see them.. with jen jen.. and we all know wat skool that is.. so cordell came over... just sat around waiting for jen to call coz she didun noe if lloyd waz gonna be picked up and if he was she wasnt gonna go.. coz "the only point im going is to see lloyd and if he gets picked up i wont see him so theres no point going".. so we waited for abt half an hr for jen to call.. and we decided we'll call her.. so she msged him coz he was supposed 2 msg her but didun.. and he replied.. saying he wasnt going to get picked up.. and cordell had a stress attack coz she was so damn nervous.. we left mie house at abt 10... i think.. and walked to granville station.. we caught the train and bumped into jeraldine... shes so funny.. she has to catch the train all the way to penrith to take a 12 yr old kid she doesnt even like to the movies.. lol.. so we caught the train together.. and i got mie key card activated.. seeing as last time i didun have mie signiture.. i had to bring mie passport.. after i got it activated.. we wondered around.. and wondered some more.. and spent a good time in toys r us.. ^_^.. ahh its so fun to play with the toys.. we were supposed 2 meet jen at 12.. and we asked her to wear a skirt.. coz ive never seen her in a skirt... and she agreed.. but wen we were waiting for her.. she was like.. 20 mins late.. and cordells like.. hmm maybe her mum didun let her out of the house in a skirt so she had to change and missed the train... and that was exactly wat happened.. lol.. lucky she didun wear a skirt.. coz it was so damn cold on that day... we played big2 at the food court for abt an hr with pplz looking at us very weirdly.. across from our table were these chicks.. and jens like.. they're watching us.. and i go.. i dare u to wink at them.. so she did.. lol.. ahaha.. yup.. we went to the bathroom before leaving at 2:00... coz it takes abt an hr to get to lewisham... we got there.. and i didun noe if andrew knew i was going.. coz the night b4 he logged off before i got to tell him.. but i msged him.. and i didun noe if his fone was on or not.. anywho... we walked to the skool.. and waited at the abandoned shop.. they were still in skool.. so we just stood around.. and then mie fone rang.. and it waz andrew.. and hes like.. where are you? .. and i said we were at the front of his skool.. waiting at that.. shop.. and hes like.. ur at the front?.. and i go.. um.. yeh at the abandoned..empty shop.. arent u in class?.. and he never answered.. he said he wasnt catching the train coz he had to go out that night.. and i was gonna ask if he wa gonna come see me anyways.. but he said he had to go and hung up straight away.. a teacher probably came.. or something.. so we were waiting.. then their bell rung.. and pplz began to come out.. carlo and lloyd and someone else came out.. so we started walking.. and i didun tink i wuld see andrew.. so we walked.. and went a different way.. and then mie fone rang.. yet agen.. and hez like.. ur at the front of the skool???.. and i said.. oh... no.. ive started walking.. i'll come back.. and hes like.. no no... its ok.. im gone.. and im like.. no.. i just crossed the road.. i'll walk back.. and hes like.. nah im gone.. im gone.. so i was like.. oh.. ok.. and hez like.. yeh.. i'll tty tonight ok.. and i go.. yeh ok.. bye..&nbsp;&nbsp; so.. i didun get to see andrew.. was quite annoyed... anywhoz.. we continued walking.. and i took fotoez of cordell and that person.. ahaha they were so far apart.. but i felt sorry for them.. it seemed so awkward.. like they.. never said much to each other.. anywhoz... he had to get off.. and so it was just me jen cordell and carlo.. we played big2.. apparently jhims really good at it.. *pssh*.. lolz.. we were at.. i cant remember wat station.. where we met.. some pplz.. that we caught the train wit.. and yeh.. we got off at our stop.. and got something to eat.. and then caught the bus.. and then.. went home..   Tuesday:  SKOOL.. yes.. first day back.. damnit.. the fact that i have mason for geography too started to sink in.. it really sux.. he talks like its history.. and its confusing coz we're in the history classrooms.. with nothing geographic in it.. besides maybe a map..   for maths.. found out we needed yr 9 text book agen.. me and angela was waiting to go into homeroom.. and she walks past pointing.. "year 9 text book ah".. and me and angela just had this blank face and stared.. then wen she walked off.. we turn to each other... u have the yr 9 txt book?.. nope.. neither do i.. ok.. lol.. so we took gina's...   english was weird.. starting short stories... ahh i hate stories.. mcbride remembered the assignment was due the nxt day.. wich sucked coz i hadnt done it.. and we have this new teacher.. i forgot her name but it ends with "hartog" anywho.. shes weird.. has a whole thing on "respect".. i dont really liek her..   science was a waste of time.. ms goes..

      hey..   im getting more sick again... i was kinda getting better yesterday coz i managed to stay up for a long time.. but today all i've done is sleep... and during mie time of sleeping.. i got woken 3 times.. first.. was mie granma coming in to give me that weird herbal stinky stuff.. she found out u didun need to make it into liquid for me to drink so i can just swallow these little round balls with water.. [she just came in now and i just took em...] so now im taking these lil thingys and i dont really think its helping...   the second time i got woken was wen mie granma bursts in the door.. turns on the lights.. and is saying... eat something and holding a bowl of noodles.. she duznt understand i cant eat that!.. and i just refused.. i mean.. i was sleeping.. i dont just go out of mie sleeping and start eating.. plus i wasnt hungry.. and wen i eat.. it hurts more than wen i dont eat..   the third time was wen mie auntie called... and mie granma obviously told her i was sick.. so she wanted to tokk 2 me... so she comes in and hands me the fone.. and most of the time all i said was "mmhm".. coz i culdnt be bothered to open mie mouth and say anything in response.. she asked me how many times ive seen the doctor and i said once.. and shes like.. only once??.. and i explained that we were gonna go agen but then granma has this medicine.. and wen she heard that shes like... hmmm dont trust that.. but then she was just kidding.. well i think so.. so then she told me i had to eat something or i had no energy.. why is everyone telling me to eat stuff.. im not hungry and im in pain everything i eat.. so why dont i just not?..   right now.. mie tummy is just aching.. but sometimes... it just massivly hurts sooo bad that i cant move.. and then it slowly goes away.. mie mum told me to count how many times that happened and how long it lasted.. and how many times i went to the toilet.. i called mie mum not too long ago.. i wanted her to buy me water... i hope she buys heaps..   anyways.. i really wanna get better.. i havnt done much in the hols.. sigh... and i have a tonne of homework to get done.. damnit...  bb
