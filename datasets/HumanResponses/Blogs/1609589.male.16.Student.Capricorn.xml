      The things that irritate me are far and few between, Nicholas. However, when I DO find something that makes me frustrated, you seem to dismiss it thinking it should go straight into my personal blog. This in itself makes me angry, and I rarely get mad. If the blog is here for our thoughts and feelings, then I will use it to any extent I wish. Unless you and Jesse veto my update. Then I will get rid of it.  Two things. 1. Its raining, so therefore I am happy 2. Some guy came into our school and we had to go into lock-down mode! It rawkd!  END!!!!

      At first, me being who I am, I was outraged that Nicholas would DARE to defy my word, but then came to realize he is completely right. But please excuse me if I feel like informing you on weird or out-of-the-ordinary things I do on a daily basis. And from now on, you can kiss my ass if you don't like my post. That said, I now move on to my next subject. --- As I now have a job, it is difficult to have a social life on weekends. For instance, this Saturday Jesse is having a Blue Man party, but I have work until 9:00pm. This also intervenes on my band practice. Point being, my weekends are fucked, and that pisses me off. --- This school year is now coming to a close, leaving me to ponder some things. One thought I had today is "Why are there so many non-band members joining the flag corps?". Scary, isn't it? It really gives me a reason o call them flaggots (flag + faggots = flaggots[this name suits them so very, very well]).   I was forced to return my Tuba to Mac today... Rolling a tuba in a tuba case across Macarthur is not an easy task, I might add. It makes you hot n' sweaty!!! --- Boston in two weeks...   *note    whenever I place a '---' that means I have just changed subjects. Just thought I would let the readers know.

      The school year is coming to an end, and in some respects, I wish it wasn't.  I mean, yeah, it's gonna be great that we don't have school or gorilla or homework for a while, but... you always lose touch with people over the summer, you know? Like, those you don't ever have any contact with when you're not in that class with them.  Since it seems to be human nature to not go outside anymore, and since noone lives close to eachother, you can't go and do stuff, unless you plan it over the internet or aim.  Of course, it's also doubtful I'll be able to see any of my friends who happen to be girls over the summer, because I've noticed the bulk of Irving's population's behavior, which entails thinking that everything you say is implying something, then taking that something and stretching it WAY out of proportion, nothing works. You can't say "hey, _______, wanna go see troy?" because everyone would just think you were going on a date, even if you weren't**, and the whole thing would be ruined.  Sure, there's AIM, and I'm grateful for that, but I get tired of reading text sometimes. Even though in truth you're talking to another person, sometimes you just need a voice to hear, so you know... you feel less alone.  I guess I've talked about all I need to for tonight, I hope I can find somewhere to go, or something to do, because I really need it right now.  **especially not with me, if you take one look at me in school or something, you'll probably figure I'm not the kind of guy who gets to go on many dates...

      ok, this is to inform the greater public at large, but apperently Dustin needs this also.  i have creadted this in my limited wisdom and if any of the members disagree feel free to voice it.  The purpose of this site is as a informational posting ground for a number of things: One, the bashing, insulting, or ranting about stupid people affecting our lives(this does not include blatent rascim, sexism, pointless hating, or insuling other members of the blog, and plz keep the monotheists bashing to a minimum, there have enough troubles being wrong with out us telling them all the time).  Two, to inform on matters of video games, for example if anyone ever find any cool sites about games, or important info such as a  real  realse date for Halo2 of Half-Life 2 that would go here.  Three, reviews for games movies or anything else that you want to give your opinion on to the greater public.  Four, discussing the inherent goodness of pie, and the act of making pudding from jello mix.  These are the set purpose of this blog,  IT IS NOT A PERSONAL BLOG  we all have our own blogs to post on and ones such as the one made by Dustin on the twentith belong there.  If anyone would like to make an amendant or a clarification on this mission statement, feel free to do so or to ask about it, this is just me, if Dustin or Jesse want to mess with it, we can talk about it, but the recten post on the twenty-third sparked in my mind that a misunderstanding or purpose existed, i hope this clears it up. ~Elf0004

      i dont understand people. thats a rather broad statement, let me clarify.  people have the strange disillsion that there is a set way to behave, and that not following that patteren of behavior, is "uncool".  The group that most closely follows these charateristics, is the "in crowd".  The people that dont meet their standards of "cool" are outcast and labeled; Goths, Geeks, Nerds, Stoners, and more... but then on top of that, the out casts groups dont like each other either, everyone hates everyone who isnt the same group as them.  They all have names for eachother, and reasons, and excuses, but what they dont have, and dont seem to want is sympathy.  People are every day being insulted and bashed for reasons that they dont really have control over, because they didnt make to sports team they aren't "jocks" and thus are a "looser".  Because they want to make somthing out of there lives and not do poorly  in school, they cant be "in" and are a "nerd".  But what is worse, in my opinion at least, is if they try to chage the person that they are, so that they can fit in with the people who they wan to be.  Because they know so much about computers and stuff, they become "geeks".  But if they try to change them selves, then that is changeing who they are, and doing that will enevitably make them regret who they were, and quite possibly hate themsleves.  There is a term for that addapted by the "goth" and other groups that i feel applies quite well for thoes kinds of people, "conformist". If anyone can offer me some insite in the depths of reason behind this kind of thing, would they plz help me to understand.   oh, and one more thing, can someone explain to me why people think im gay?  apperently its a widely held opinion.. at least among the fucks at my school.  or at least it according to my ex-girlfriend, but shes an idiot, so it doesnt matter that much i guess... night then

ShuChoMouf: and satan laughed so hard his horns turned into jello I play tuba07: *GASP* I play tuba: NOT JELLO ShuChoMouf: and then he cried because jello is an absolute good, therefore satan couldnt eat it I play tuba: u know, i can make pudding out of jello gelatin mix ShuChoMouf: i know, i know ShuChoMouf: i have some gelatin mix I play tuba: only on wednesdays, though ShuChoMouf: i thought it was thursdays!

      I got back from Boston yesterday, and it was pretty cool. For the first 4 days Katie was being mean to me... But then she was suddenly nice on the last full day. That made me so happy...  I was thinking it was going to not be as nearly cool as I thought it was going to be but, DAMN, was I wrong. I like the city! It's cool beans!!! I really   Blue Man... oh my god... so awesome... loved it... cant stop thinking about it! The spin painting they made was cool. Even more-so because i BOUGHT IT. Boo-yah! Just goes to show you that i CAN do something better than Jesse ~Shakes fist in air~. I can see why Jess   ...  Me... Nobody understood it though. Like when they're playing and then the band is supposed to come in, but they dont and they look confused. Nobody got that! I was very offended! Stoopid non-Blue Man fans...  Thats all for now!

      Ok, so I went to see it this afternoon, and I thought it was pretty good, so heresy the review:  the beginning has our hero Peter Parker experiencing a dramatic decline in the quality of his life, in living his double life as Spiderman was sapping away all his time, he was fired from his job, and was flunking in collage, and wasn't even making the rent from his pictures.  At his surprise b-day party we are reacquainted with his friends, the rich kid Harry and his romantic interest Mary-Jane.  The seemingly final straw in his life as Spiderman conflicting with his life as Peter is when he misses the a performance of MJ's play, and she is very upset with him and when is powers begin to fail on him he gives up his life as Spiderman and Peter Parker's life greatly improves.  He does well in school and finally makes it to MJ's play, and everything seems to be going better, except Harry wont let up with his vengeance of killing Spiderman as pay-back for his fathers death.  Once he learns that MJ is getting married, he crumbles again, soon a time comes when he realizes that he must be the friendly-neabiorhood-Spiderman.  It was both an action and a romance, but the sappy stuff was worth it to see Spidy get his ass handed to him by a six-armed villain.  All in all, you should see this movie, but don't stay till the end, there isn't anything special, I waited and found nothing, thanks.

      Okay, so none of us have been updating this lately, and that makes me kinda sad... We need to get back into this, people1!!11!!  --- So I ditched my old band, Fatal Error, because we had nothing going. Our keyboardist didnt have a keyboard, our drummer was a stoner, and my other guitarist moved away. Yeah... doesnt that suck? So now im starting one up with Jesse (my awesome little percussionist), Eric (The not-so-little bassist), Me (Sexiest guitarist on the planet earth), and maybe Matt (another guitar) but he kinda doesnt like me because of the whole "Lesa" ordeal. DAMN YOU WOMEN!!! I had this idea for an instrument for Jesse. So far I call it "The Station" because it's stationary (that means it dont move [or with difficulty]). Its like the Blue Man tubulum, but it will the hitting tube part thing infront of him with two toms on either side. The tubes lead up over his head, and just sit there. It's a good idea! Jesse says so! Damnit! --- I am soon going to be painting my room!!! Joy!!! Im gonna force Jesse to come over, and im gonna TRY to get Blanton to come over to help paint it. Yeah... it's gonna rock1!11!! I want to put a silhoette of my guitar on my wall, and then paint inside the name of the band. That would be neato! --- I just destroyed the whole purpose of this blog by putting in these updates, didnt I? Eh... oh well. If you have a problem with it you can STFU!1!11!!!

      Man, I want to have something to eat but we have nothing good in the house.  I want to go watch TV, but my brother is watching his stupid fucking anime shit.  I hate anime so fucking much it's not even funny.  It makes no sense, it looks completely stupid, and everybody who watches it turns into a complete moron.  Those damn Japanese people are trying to poison us.  Now, i'm not saying asians as a whole are dumb, they're not. Many of my good friends are asian. Some of me friends are Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Pilipino, and they're all great people.  but I HATE ANIME!!!!

      I remembered what i was gonna put!  I was talkin to my mom today, and for some reason we were talking about the Boston trip, and she said "what else was fun besides Blue Man Group and Arlington St.?"  Jesse: "Well, the sunset cruise was pretty fun... if not cold. Really really cold." Mom: "Oh? Meet anyone?" J: "Yeah, we went on the cruise with Tom.. whatshisname" M: "Shade?" J: "No, not shade, even though we did meet him... *cough* .... he is one of the many Tom's that have been interns at our church before... haha" M: "Oh, i think i know who you're talking about"  So we both tried to explain him to eachother for a minute, and right at the exact same time we both said the same thing.. "The guy with the big teeth?"  Haha, that was so hillarious! We both started cracking up loud-- so loud we interrupted the dog class going on.... but i didn't care. Those people are obsessed anyway.  I hate talking about people i dont hate like that, but, damn, those are some huge teef!  I also forgot that I was back in the mother of all Christian states in the U.S. because my mom was saying "Yeah, when I met Tom(we figured out his last name was pronounced Belote, but im not sure if thats how you spell it...) He seemed to be really... what's the word... high strung?"  And I said "Oh, like he would be a fundamentalist right wing christian guy?"  She said "Shhh!!! but... yes."  I got a couple glances from that one, i said it like I wasn't christian! ~gasp~  ...but I didn't care. Those people are obsessed anyway.   I had burned a copy of the Blue Man Group album for my brother (hes such a little moocher- mom and dad buy everything for him and i have to pay for everything- hed be rich if he didnt go to the mall with the goof troop(what i call his new friends) all the time), he brought it in the car to the dog show today. We were listening to the White Rabbit track (COA people know), When my mom started singing along with the lyrics, my brother looked at her like a deer looks at an oncoming train... but if the deer looked suprised. That's how he looked. He couldnt, for the life of him figure out why or how my mom knew these lyrics.  It was written in the 70's!!!! By Jefferson Airplane! Stupid band name, gr8 song. I hate who sings it in the blue man group album, tho- some stuck up french chick saying in the interview "i wanted to chang-uh the song-uh from what jefferson-uh airplanuh did in the 70'suh"  I dontuh likeuh frenchuh peopleuh. Even though i'm like... heh.. a 10th french meself. I hate meself. I dont wanna be german, french... I wanna be Italian- at least irish! Come on!  At least i'm a part Scottish-irish.  Woah, how did i switch topics that fast? Train of thought.... it's coming... getting closer... almost here... it's finally here.... Oh shit, its gone! Where'd it go?  I confuse me sometimes.  Well, that's enough out of me, Now returning to your regularly scheduled life.

      You know what I had to do today? I had to go to a dog seminar that my mom set up and help carry and set up stuff. Then i had to sit there. for 8 HOURS listening to NOTHING but dog training. How do these people do it? It's an ANIMAL, it doesnt need to goto 8 hours of school!  Grr, i don't wanna talk about it... I don't wanna see another dog for a while.. even though i have to do the same thing again tomata. I get a hundred bucks for helping out tho so its worth it.  You know who's voice i wish i had? Sam Fisher, from Splinter Cell. Damn, that voice was cool. It's the only cool and dark and brooding voice... that was voiced by a white guy. Ever. It's something to strive for. That guy has something.  Dangit, it's 7 already?!?!? I can't take a nap now! Oh well, just 3 more hours. No wait, it's 7:45, so it's closer to 8! 2 more hours! No, wait! Time is accellerating at a faster speed than normal?!?! It's 10?!?!?! Well then, I'm going to bed. See ya!  Notttt really. I haven't even gotten any of that pizza yet. In fact, it seems like pizza time for me right now. I'll post back l8r when i remember what i was gonna put in this thing today.

      You know what I hate? People who rip games. They just rip, distribute, rip, distribute- they are what is keeping the gaming industry to propel as rapidly as we thought it should- they dont have enough money because of these pricks! Now, I'm not talking about little puny games who's companies are extinct, even I do that, I'm talking about big name games like BF1942, Mafia, Max Payne, Enter The Matrix, and all the others. Just buy the freaking game like you're supposed to!  Oh, i know, "I don't have enough money" bullshit- you gotta work for it! LIKE I DO!!! I save up, i do my chores, i take out the trash, i mow the lawn, i dont bitch my parents around like my brother does, and look at me! Dan knows- he saw it! My whole freaking FLOOR is covered with game cds! That's why you don't rip. It's something to strive for. Can you show me a whole room full of game cd's? I didn't think so.    I was watching Greg Proops standup today, it's hillarious. He was talking about how we were lied to throughout our growin up about history. "Oh really, greg? Which ones?" All of them.  The pilgrims came to america to escape relimagious persecution in Europe!  Then he goes into song... "We lied about history because it *sounds* better and it *tastes* better than the trruuuuuuth.. so let's just pretend it really happened...."  I'll show you whizzut he did later- just not in large groups- im not into exhibitionism. :-O!!!  Well, in There yesterday, i beat this guy's ass at paintball. he was all like ":-O" when he fell over and the ragdoll effects(yes, it has em) took over, and I was all like "X-P." We were hoverboard fighting. It was oh so much fun!

      What the hell is wrong with you freaking CS people? I HATE CS!!! GET THE HELL OVER IT!!!!! Here's a conversation i had with an idiot today-  (dont think im overreacting, im constantly having to tell this prick i hate CS)   Idiot: com to my cs lan today Idiot: com right now ShuChoMouff: dude- what the FUCK is your problem? ShuChoMouff: do you do that on purpose or are you just a retard? ShuChoMouff: I HATE CS ShuChoMouff: so SHUT THE FUCK UP Idiot:  everyone likes it butu ShuChoMouff: what the FUCK is there not to get? Idiot: i think u jus do that to be differnt ShuChoMouff: you're such a fuck ShuChoMouff: dont talk to me ShuChoMouff: until you wanna stop being an asshole  All cs people i know- ALL OF THEM- think its completely IMPOSSIBLE for me to hate it. And i do. So call me the devil all you want(christians do it all the time), but don't mess with me about cs.  Now, if the idiot i was talking to lightens up, i may just delete this post, but until then, it stays.  What's wrong with CS, you ask? What is CS, you ask?  CS, or Counter-Strike,  is a little mod made for the hit game Half-Life by developer Valve Software. There are 2 teams. Terrorist, and Counter-Terrorist.  The Terrorist's goal is simple. Plant some kind of explosive where there is a biiiig target, and all the while keep the Counter-terrorists from rescuing any hostages they may have around the map.  The Counter-Terrorist's goal is simple. Rescue any hostages the Terrorists may have scattered around the map, and keep the terrorists from planting the bomb by either killing all the terrorists, or defusing the bomb once it's been planted.  And it's like this, over and over and over and over.  Problems? What problems? here are some.  1. No plot. Whatsoever. None. Zip. Zero.  2. It looks like crap. The Half-Life engine used to look great, but now it's just a bunch of polygons.  3. When you die, you have to wait what seems like 3 years just to get back into the game. So if you're a newbie, you're fucked.  4. It's not fun. It's the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over (etc...)  5. Most everybody who plays it is a complete asshole. It almost never fails- cs makes you a hybrid jerk-idiot.  6. Hacks- almost everyone who has the damn game has some way to cheat the game- either with being able to see thru walls, or have a program that aims perfectly for them, or invincible mode, something to that effect.  Why does noone see these faults? CS is the most popular online game in the world, apparentally, according to some secretive reviewing organization. Are humans that blind? Apparentally, yes.  I think the There servers are coming back up soon, I'll see you all later!

It's got a gr8 community(not to mention if you refer me when you get on, i get more therebucks!), races, paintballing, i might even let you borrow my hoverpack for a while. So sign up!  No, I don't work for There, Inc.  urlLink There.com!   Anyway... uhh... i think i've talked about everything i've been thinking about in recent posts, the most exciting thing i've done today is filter out the Bilge tank in the boat- almost hit my dad with the water when i turned it on! hahahahahah.  Well, i guess that's it for now, I'll post back later today if i have any more independent thoughts.

      Man... so bored... about 45 minutes left till TGC, and i'm still bored.  I was thinking about this thing my friend designed- it's a barcode, and in place of where the numbers should be, it says "BE YOURSELF." I went on the internet, found a picture of a barcode, and remade that on the computer. I'll give it to her once i get back home.  Got me thinking about conformity. How this whole world revolves about obeying the system, by being the same. How there are people who subconsciously realize this, and strive to be different by doing things people don't "normally" do, thus creating goths, punks, and everything inbetween. What they don't realize is, they started another kind of system, another social... 'thing' where everyone is the same. There's no escaping it.  Some people would counter that by saying "if you do it alone, its wierd, and when you do it together, it's a club." I used to say that. But then you have to ask yourself a question- "Why are there no wierd people, then?" Everybody is following somebody. There are barely any new ideas to be had these days.  My motto has always been "If it's not fun, why do it?" Even though I've always mostly obeyed by the rules... mostly.  Then things come along to help the 'differences' to become the same. There's Hot Topic, which you all hopefully have read about in an earlier post, and other things, but I'm hard pressed to list them right now.  When a friend of mine (the one i stole the barcode idea from) read my little article about hot topic, she said "Thanks alot, I work at Hot Topic!" I didn't say it, but what I thought was "Good. Feeding off the system. I'm all in favor of that."-although now, I wonder why i didn't say it.  Well, that's enough out of me for now. That took me about 15 minutes to think up and write, plus when my internet cut out and i had to reboot, so there we go!

      I can't see out my window anymore. The leaves from the trees have grown to cover the sun again. Now, out of the corner of my eye, it looks like my window is squirming. I think that's why i had it closed in the first place.  I went outside to help my mom bring in the groceries, and i was hit by a huge gust of hot air. It was like a politician or some kind of religious figure just walked into my house.  Well, the Galaxies beta is over. Me, being the idiot that I am, accidentally got rid of the game, htinking the beta was already over, but it wasn't. Luckily, jason took some screenshots for me, so i was able to see the memorial. I'm gonna prolly get it again after this weekend, when i have some money. I'm wasting all the 15 bucks i have now to goto TGC tonight, so i can get out of the house(and play video games at a DIFFERENT place! haha).  Oh well. That's it for now. I'm gonna go watch tv with my "TGC tonite! Anyone wanna come? Call me!" away message up. So, Anyone wanna come to TGC tonite? Read my away message!

      Has anybody else noticed this thing people are doing with phone numbers? It's stupid. Instead of putting a full area code like you're supposed to, they just replace it with a (9) or a (2). How, may i ask, if im in a different place, would i know what 9 stands for? What If i lived in a place where the area code was 948? What then? Would i call 948 and get some other guy's number? No. I appreciate you people's endless endeavor to make everything as short as possible(you can see an example of this every time someone types "ttyl" or "lylas aaf" or "sdjbnsinsijslfghslncvoauefjvmsldjkf"), but that one is just impractical.  Okay, on to the actual journal part.  I'm going to TGC tonight at about 7, I'm trying to round up people. I have Jason(possibly alex) and Eric, but nooo syed's not on. and we haven't been able to get a hold of Todd. Who knows, this might just be a 3-people thing. We'll see what turns up.  How exciting for the average reader!

      I've recently been informed by a good friend of mine that this journal "Made my day" when she read it. I feel honored. Thanks, Sarah.  I honestly don't know how the tormented rantings of a demented, misunderstood teenager could make someone's day, but hey, whatever floats your boat, right?  I don't think I've ever used that expression before. "Floats your boat." Good for me.  "Hey, Joe, Let's go see Legally Blonde 2!" "Uhh... Whatever floats your boat, Bob! I'll... just be... over... here.... by the door.... yeah...  Guess what, everybody!?!? my cd burner works now i think! Right now I'm burning the Blue Man album(there i go again...) so i'm back in action if this cd works! Wheeee!!

      That cat is going to be the death of me.   For all of you who don't know, my family lost one of our cats, named Mouse, a week before I left for Boston. Well, when my mom went to the pound to look for him(some of you know what's coming), she saw the cutest little kitten, who couldn't have been over 3 weeks old. Now we have a new cat.   We named him Yoda. But not after Yoda. We named him after Yoda's father, Yoda. Get it? No? Okay.  He seemed to be getting along fine when I left (we took him campin'), and now I'm back- and i keep wondering what this monster is that is rummaging around my room. He's a wild man.   Everybody who saw the new Star Wars saw how Yoda broke out with his 2-inch long lightsaber and kicked Dooku's ass, right? Well, imagine if he were on Meth in that same scene, subtract the lightsaber and add wolverine's claws, and you get our new cat.   Apparentally, right before my parents left for the airport to pick me up, my dad was playin with the cat, so when i saw him, he had a big old scratch across his nose. I wondered if he had stuck his face in his computer's cooling fan. Nope, just a cranked up Yoda.   In other news, in Maine, a group of Crystal Meth users were arrested by police this morning, with the first 6 getting captured immediatley, and the remaining four escaped by sprinting completely across Canada.   Wow, I got through an entire post without mentioning Blue Man Group! Oh, sh- DAMMIT!!!

      I neeeeed some HUMAN interaction!!! AIM doesnt cut it(as much) any more! I need to go do something. Like what, you say? Someone needs to throw a party. Or get a bunch of people to go see a movie. Or SOMETHING!!! and invite me. COME ONNN!!!! please?  I guess that sums up what 2 days of isolation can do to a guy. I can't have anyone over cuz there's nothing to do, I can't go anywhere because I'm broke, and most the people i want to talk to on AIM are either always away or gone! What is a suffering athiest to do!?!?!  Current Mood: Unhappily stressed!!! ((>  Current music: Under My Feet by Celldweller

      Hahahahah my dad is so cool- he and some buddies at work ripped Finding Nemo, 2fast 2furious, The Hulk, and Lord Of The Rings: the 2 towers, and called me from work asking ME how to play them! I felt honored. Unfortunately, noone at his work had a DVD rom or player so they cant play them, so hes just gonna give em to me. HA!  Every review on the new Blue Man Group rock tour said that it wasn't as magical as the original show they had. For one, the theater is HUGE now, so you don't get the great up close look that you did before. I know, i know, they were trying something new, but BMG is one of those things you need to feel that you are kind of a part of- even if it is a fairly small one. After the performance(the original one), the performers stay in character after the show so people who went in can shake hands, get a blue high five (one girl i know even got her cheek kissed by one of them- it rubbed off soon after...), things like that, but if they were to try that after the big concert, it could take hours, and dissapoint some people that wouldnt be able to see them.  That's it for now. I'll post back soon.  Again, thanks to all of you who read this.

      Here's an away message I put up tonight in case you missed it plus some added commentary i couldnt fit because AIM has too many limitations:  "I'm off in bed- this day has been so boring... I guess i found the reason I've been depressed all these years... Texas.... dammit! Oh well, another 3-5 years here, and that's it. Now that I know there are better places out there to live, where i don't have to live with the endless torment of christian shitholes that have nothing better to do with their time than make me miserable. Sorry, christian friends, but i just hate religion, and you all are gonna have to get the hell over it.  ALWAYS REMEMBER- HITLER WAS A CATHOLIC."  --I hate to break it down into religion like this, but really, thats what it turns into.   But enough about me. What about you? How do you feel that the whole world is run by an inescapable sense of insecurity?  Write a letter to your favorite christian-supporting politions(Let's say... oh.... George Dubya) and either tell him to:  1. Lead on, you are a great president and I wish that some day i could be as great as you! (*cough ASSHOLE *cough*) --or-- 2. You lying pretzel-choking piece of crap! Why the hell are you screwing our country over like this? You can shove that cross right up your ass for all I care!  Those of you who picked number two should be eligible for some kind of award. I should make my own. The Snider award. That'll show em. Give people an award for being different.  Speaking of being different, that brings me to another topic. a Hot Topic.  What was the person who created the Hot Topic chain of stores thinking? What he/she did was make being punk not creative anymore. I think Keith from the webcomic Mall Monkeys said it best:  "Hot Topic is a store that attempts to be a "Hot Topic" by being controversial. But, it's a business. They sell weird clothes and jewelry. They have a small selection of cds. Hot Topic removed the fun out of "being different". When kids no longer had to make their own spiked jewelry out of dog collars and such, a new generation of half-assed "freaks", hardcore kids, goths, and mainstream punks showed up. Ever since, Hot Topic, to me at least, has been the hangout for rich trendy kids. They're just as bad as the kids who shop only at Abercrombie and Fitch."  So it degenerates into the fact that the kids who are being "different" end up being the same.  I think Hawaiian shirts and Cargo pants work for me for now.  I can't believe i had all this to say at midnight.   Thank you all who read all this ranting of mine- the reason i have this journal is for my voice to be heard, and you are a huge step in that direction.

      I keep thinking about my trip on the airplane back from Boston... about how that was the end of COA. Well, not as much about that as that asshole on the plane. God, he was an asshole! I loved how at the end of the flight the entire mass of passengers and crew(led by me) collectively threw him out of the airplane. I thought that that was the start of pure acceptance between humans of all races. Or maybe I just dreamed that. God, that guy was an asshole.  I was readin on this website about these 2 people, on halloween, dressed up as Blue Man Group and went to parties and passed out twinkies. I think that would be cool to do. We should do it. I need 2 people. Preferrably people that have access to drumsticks and/or lengths of PVC pipe(optional). It'd be even cooler to have a girl in there, just to mix up the.... 'mix' a little bit. Like at one of Sarah's parties, which are cool already, could be souped up(I like that word... soup) some more with special guests who couldn't talk, and were just trying to figure out the world around them. I know BMG chose 3 blue men at a time because it gives both a feeling of community, and a feeling of isolation. I watched a video of 3 blue men walking around Boston. It was crazy. One of them stepped in gum, and they all watched in curious amusement as the one who stepped in it picked his foot up off the ground, with a trail of gum still stuck to the sidewalk. Then, as if the gum dissapeared, they all 3 lost interest and went into a smoothie shop, who somehow passed their order on to the waiter.  I just love that. How did they come up with a completely new personality type like that? I proved Rhiannon wrong last night when she said that "No band is unique. Not one." and then I ran rings around her logically.  You may call me obsessed, but I think there's so much depth in this thing that it deserves a little studying.  ...I type too much...

      Welcome, one and all to my new journal!  (Blog says this thing is ad supported... i wonder what that means???? I guess it means you better brace yourself for some ads)  Well, I just got back from Boston last nite at the airport, what a trip!! At first I was kind of questioning whether I would end up liking it or not, but it turned out about.... oh... i think it's safe to say a BILLION times better than i expected!  Lemme make a shoutout to the COA people- You guys are the greatest- I don't think i could come up with anyone else i know that would have made that anywhere close to as fun as it was.  ...Except for that church service on Sunday...  blah  So i've missed a week of stuff in Irving, so what? I got all caught up and stuff last night.  Did we all agree that Blue Man Group was the highlight of the whole trip? I think we did, but i'm not sure...  I'm also not sure, but i think somewhere along the way I was unofficially voted funniest person in Boston. But again, I'm not sure. X-P  Pudding.  Okay, this weekend, I'm off to Houston for 2 days to work to help my mom with this dog training thing she's doing. I get a hundred dollahs. :-O!  I keep thinking about that guy sitting opposite me on our row on the plane. He was an | ASSHOLE | !   Now that I'm home in Irving, All i have left to think to myself is "How the hell did i ever have fun here?" Besides... the people, the mall, and the TGC, Irving is kind of a bland place to live. Oh sure, the city is trying to make itself more pedestrian-prone, what with walk-through parks for a 1/7 mile stretch on Story Road, but i think all 3 people who have ever walked through them said that it wasn't as much of an exciting and magical journey as the architects had imagined.  Well, at least we can't be killed by falling poodles, right? RIGHT!??!?!?!  I guess it's back to making my cartoons.  I'll post back later.

      Well folks, this is going to be the last day of this archive section... Whee!!! I was planning for this month to go out with a bang, but I guess that today is going to be as much of a boring monkey-face as the rest of the month.  So I've had this webjournal for 2 months, eh?   OH SHOOT i gotta go... dangit... i'll update later... :-D  LATER:  Okay, I'm back, and i have something to talk about.  What the hell is this? I know a bunch of girls who play soccer and they always have these stupid lists that compare playing soccer with doing the nasty. Here is one i saw just recently(i hope i can remember the whole thing)  1.We work balls really well 2.We have tremendous stamina and endurance 3.We do it for 90 minutes in 11 different positions 4.We like to be on top of our game 5.We enjoy getting hot and sweaty 6.We wear short shorts for easy play 7.We're used to getting our knees dirty 8.We know how to take it up the middle 9.We go hard at headers 10.We play the field until we SCORE!!!  What??!?!? Does being a soccer player automatically make you think it's funny to act like a prostitute? It's just not funny! It may be semi-clever, but it's not funny. It's just stupid.  If you got offended by that, you obviously need to do some meditation and figure out WHY that registers in your head as funny. Because it's not.  How's that for going out with a bang? Yes, yes, i know, i kick ass.

      --DRUMBONE STATUS--  90% done. The drumbone is fully functional and both sliders are working. The only thing left to do is to tune it.

      Man, my family has been being one big ass-hat the past 2 days. Yesterday, my parents made us clean the back room(which i admit, Does look nice now), but they were freaking out when it took me more than a second to do something, or come to her, or finish my fucking sandwich she said i could take a break to have. And then today, i come downstairs and my brother is just standing there lookin at the microwave, and I asked(quite nicely i might add), "Whatcha doin?"  He replied in a really surly jerk-ass voice "Standing..." and I was tired of always taking shit from him so i said "i know you're standing, what are you DOING standing there? Are you waiting?" He goes "YES!!! God!!!" and I said "then why didnt you just SAY THAT YOU WERE WAITING, and i wouldnt still be TALKING TO YOU!." and my dad gets all indignant on me! He says "Jesse, dont be mean to your brother!" and I say "but did you HEAR him? hes been like this for forever!"  GOD my parents are like fucking BLIND to my brother latley, they let him mouth off to them(ok, they do say "dont talk to me that way," but they dont do anything about it), not make him cut is hair so he doesnt look bad, GOD they would take away my EVERYTHING priveleges if i was that much of a jerk!  Yeah, and other than that, my day sucked.  Once again, if my brother stops being an ass-hat and gets his hair cut, this post is goin down.

      I'm reminded of the time that Todd, Syed and I in middle school got so pissed at the ILLEGAL advertising of bible study on the school walls, we walked around and tore them all of. You people who have been wondering who did that, it was us. And we'd do it again, too. We even tore off the ones on the open teacher's doors. It was so fun.  Anybody want to ruin any illegal christian takeover attemps that are happening all the time? Call or IM me and we'll set up details.

      Oh snap, dogg! OH SNAPP!!! What does that even mean? I'm talking about slang. People just say something that means nothing, and we accept it. Here is a list of some that have bothered me in the past:  Represent! Word. Rock on. Pimpin. Yo. Dog. Dogg.  They don't mean anything! I mean, where, when and why did Dog replace "man" or "Yo" replace "hey?"  There are more than what i listed(and I know I put Dog twice, get a life), but the only time i ever really think about them are when they are said. So, if you think of any, send me an IM and pitch em to me, if I decide they're good, i'll post em here.  Todd, if you're reading this, i didn't goto TGC for a couple reasons.  1. possibility of CS whore infestation 2. All the fat-asses who sit in the chairs there break em 3. I have to save my money for the BMG concert.  Speaking of which, I REALLY need to buy those tickets, TODAY!!! If you want to go, call me NOW!!! I won't have this number posted for long, but call me @ 972-650-8456 if you wanna go! it'll end up being about $33 bucks a person. AND we get good balcony seats! HURRY!!!

      You know what bothers me at about the same level as CS? it's those CS whores. They go to Lan parties(they're at TGC whenever there's a tournament) and prance around and play games (and win, because the CS losers are all wussies, they would never let the only girl they've ever been within a meter of lose). They come to these things wearing see-through white t-shirts and short-shorts, and get all the CS losers to sign the shirt with sharpies. Has gaming gone so low as to have it's own form of prostitution? Bawls came in as a corporate takeover, now we need girls to come in and hint to the CS kids that they aren't as much of a loser as they really are!  If this post offends you in any way, like if you are a cs loser that likes it when those girls come and play, or ESPECIALLY if you actually ARE one of those girls, IM me, and tell me how doing this is not a toned down form of sluttery, i might just retract this statement. But until then, this post stands proud.

      In accordance to my last post, here is an amusing anec-dote.  When my dad and I went to home depots/lowes to search for PVC pipe, one thing bugged me that made me realize that the world is going down the drain, is that there were no more HOT DOG stands in front of the home depot! WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO?!?!?!?!  Home Depot's hot dogs were the best things EVER!!! You all agree with me, right? I used to hate coming to Home Depot except for the end when we got hot dogs! Now I'm sad.  See?? Didn't that get interesting? I wasn't gonna put it for some stupid reason, but now i've decided to.

      Wow, I hadn't realized it, but I was re-reading my webjournal (yes, i care JUST that much), and realized that i've been really bitter and mad at everything ever since i got those elastic pieces-o-crap in my mouth. For a while there, i was being an asshole and talking about stuff nobody cared about, seems like after that AIM conversation I posted(I like to alienate the new readers), i was pretty much happy-go-lucky.  I guess I'll still use little amusing anec-dotes from now on, but mostly only if it'll spin off into something interesting.

      You know what I don't get? Homophobics. We all have that friend, the one that keeps saying that gay sex is wrong, or gross, or something, that they really have no fucking right to talk about because it never happens anywhere near them. I think that homophobia is such a waste of energy, there are much more useful things to hate, like christianity, or the government!  I'm not gay meself, but i know people who are, and they aren't gross or disgusting. These homophobes seem to think that wherever gay people are going, theyre doing disgusting things out in public and they don't. I don't even know why they're so uptight on this subject, it doesnt say anywhere in the bible or anything that god hates gays, people say some verse in the bible that can be INTERPRETED to say that god hates gays, but it could also be INTERPRETED to say that god doesnt like incest, which is totally fine, incest is pretty stupid. If you're so lame that the only way you can have kids is to do it with your sister, well, that's your business, but it's still pretty stupid.  That brings me back to the homophobia topic, these people who are trying to ban gay sex are prying into other people's business that they have no right getting into. People have the right to live their own life, and just because pat robertson(i hate him) says that we should pray for 21 days to get god to fuck over the supreme court(i hate the supreme court too, but not as much as pat robertson), doesnt mean it's right.  What got me started on this is I just watched that South Park where Starvin Marvin brought the ethiopeans to Marklar, and Pat Robertson(i still hate him) was on the 600 club talking about "now, now, stay with me on this one folks... we need a negative argon tractor disruptor... now not a REGULAR argon tractor disruptor, but a NEGATIVE argon tractor disruptor... to... spread the word of jesus."  That wasn't it, though, after watching 2 episodes of Insomnia, the daily show came on, and they had a report on pat robertson was blabbing his fat mouth off about how god should get those 3 supreme court justices... "God knows their names, he knows where they live..." But if god has such a big opinion about sodomy, why the hell did he let the law get passed in the first place? He's all-powerful, but he cant take shit from the supreme court? I vote to elect a new god! A less lazy one! I'm still athiest, but i'm talking like there IS a god so christians can follow me. Even though there isn't. Are you getting this?  Well, after writing that paragraph, I thought a couple minutes about what to write next, but then I realized that I was done with this topic. So I'll start another one.  I never realized this before, but have you noticed that in the TV show Rugrats, the babies have really REALLY bad and uncaring parents? I mean, they leave their kids in a playpen with holes they can fit through with a SCREWDRIVER, and leave these babies unattended for hours on end! I don't watch it anymore, ever since Dil came on the show the stories have been about how pathetic Chuckie's dad is, how much different Kimi is than the other babies, and all that junk. But i remember that episode, while it was hillarious how they messed the whole house up, when the babies thought the world ended, all the parents had gone out, had left angelica in charge of the babies(i guess), and they ended up filling the house with water.  Tommy is like, what, 1? Yeah, he's been 1 for about 10 years, right? so, assuming that every episode is a day(even though some span 2 or 3... sometimes a couple weeks), once they get to 365 episodes, tommy will absolutley HAVE to have a birthday, right? Or, the world would fold in on itself and everybody would die.  I can't think anymore, my brain is tired, I'm gonna go watch Tron, because its colorful! You don't need to have a non-tired brain to look at the colors, man!

      How many of you have seen the guilt-trip test?  It's at http://blunttruth.jaazsoftware.com/index.cfm  It gives you a bunch of personal prefrence questions about the person who you're taking the test about (Am I lazy? How is my smile?) and you have to put an answer as 1-10.  I call it the guilt-trip test because whatever answer you end up putting makes you feel guilty for putting it. If you put like a 5-1, you feel bad because the other person will feel bad about themselves, if you put 6-7 you fele guilty because the other person will feel they're not good enough, and if you put 8-10 you feel guilty because honestly, their smile isn't that great (im not talking about any 1 person).  But seriously, this test was made for selfish insecure bastards who have nothing better to do than wonder what other people think of them. Me? I say if you don't like me, go fuck yourself. It's your loss. I really don't care. My friends are the coolest people in the world, but if you don't like me, cut the crap and tell me and get on with it, because I don't want to be friends with someone who hates me.  Like, for instance, if there are any of my christian friends out there that are only being friends with me in the hopes ill become christian, go fuck a cheese grater, i dont want that kind of friend. But if you USED to only be friends with me because you hoped i'd convert, then realize that i was really cool and decided to be friends with me anyway, even better! You deserve money.  My friends who are christian are still all really cool, but if you're not REALLY my friend, tough shit, tell me, let me punch you in the face for lying to me (metaphorically or not, depending on if youre a girl or not :-D), then get on with your life..  That's my ranting session for today, when i think of something else I'll post back, but I need to head to the airport to pick my dad up. See ya!

      At first, I was skeptical about the BMG's Complex Rock tour, but now I'm glad that they're coming to dallas and I am probably going to get tickets. It's on August 12, so if anybody wants to go, IM or call me and we'll figure something out.  Ticket prices:  Low: $23.50 Medium: $31.00 High: $41.00  If you have ever been to Next Stage @ Grand Prairie, (i have), you know how seating is laid out, so it'll be easier to choose a seat. I wish i knew which section of seats was usually picked to go on stage, (yes, people go on stage) so who knows...  People singing along with BMG- Dave Matthews Tracy Bonham Gavin Rossdale Venus Hum   Shoot, i need to buy these tickets FAST, i just searched for best tickets available for 4 people, we get far west balcony :( so IM me now if you wanna go!

      Concerning Funnest Kid In America: Is it okay for me to feel embarassed FOR these kids? They honestly have no self-consciousness at all, and they ALL perform the same material. ALL OF THEM.  And apparentally, according to nickelodeon, "Funny" means making goofy noises, wobbling around, and acting like Ace Ventura.  The new All That is no good, anyways.  And I also would like to point out that the guy hosting that deserves to get punched in the face for pissing me off.

      I've decided that Dexter's Laboratory is bullcrap. In fact, I've decided that all cartoons by that artist are crap. Especially the new ones.  Old ones: The old Dexters Lab, Powerpuff girls, they used to be funny, but they always make fun of anime, and they take it WAY too seriously. So that means it's crap.  New ones: New Dexter's lab, Samurai Jack, That stupid new teenage-robot thing on Nickelodeon, all of them are crap because they make no sense, and they look like crap.   The reviewers all said Samurai Jack is "visually appealing." Bull crap, the guy just drew a bunch of squiggles on a piece of paper & called it background, took the Professor from Powerpuff Girls, widened his eyes & called him a hero, and replaced good voice acting/story with mindless action. Complete bullcrap.  Cartoon Network is almost completely bullcrap now, too. The only thing saving it right now, and I mean the ONLY thing, is Ed Edd and Eddy. And that show has 1 more season left before it's gone. Cartoon Network is a lost cause.  Hate to say it, but Nickelodeon is heading that way too. It has a couple good things tho, Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, and when that guy who hosts "funniest kid in america" and Dave Aizer got killed by firing squad on live TV, that was great, too. Or maybe i just dreamed that.  I've turned to Comedy Central, because almost all of their shows are good. Not Crank Yankers or Man Show though, those 2 are just stupid.  I'm With Busey is freaking hillarious, and I'm actually having fun watching Last Comic Standing. I watch Friday Night Standup every.... friday night....  They need to stop showing those damn 80's movies that aren't funny, though. They need to put on some Who's Line Is It Anyway, and buy back rights to MST3k so they can show the old Comedy Central episodes, and quit running SNL reruns so damn often.  And that's my section on TV tonight, folks. See ya!

      I went to the orthodontist today and they gave me those fucking elastic things that attach from the top of my braces to the bottom. Apparentally it's supposed to pull my jaw up, but all it's doing is pulling my fangs out.  Now I know how Dan feels.  Anyway, I reinstalled Half-Life and have been playing Natural Selection. Not that any of you would care, I just thought that I'd point that out.  I'm supposed to Mow the lawn, clean my room, AND do 2 hours of driving stuff today. I doubt that'll be able to happen.  This is so retarted...

      Well, I finished everything on the drumbone except the sliders, tuning, riveting, and painting. It already looks like a drumbone, but we need to tune it. A LOT!!! We still need the 6" pipe, but we cant finish it until friday, when my dad gets back from chicago. :-D! So i have a non-working drumbone for the next week. I'll try and find a camera.

      Oh man this is so stupid. My mom decides to start her job on the exact day my dad leaves to goto Chicago, so I won't be able to do anything all week! So for the next week, itll be extremely hard for me to go anywhere or do anything, i wont be able to finish(or even start) the drumbone until a week from tomorrow. Damn, this sucks.  Cant even drive yet, so im stuck at this damn place.  And i cant even call my mom to ask if i can go somewhere, cuz shes at school or work all day.  Can't have friends over, because theres no "supervision."  Ugh, i dont want to even type anymore right now. I dont wanna do anything right now.

      Well, dad and I went to home depot, picked up every part for the drumbone we needed except 1. We got the elbows, the saw, rivets/bit, glue, primer, 4" pipe, but we couldnt find the 6" pipe. They just didnt have it. Turns out the instructions we got weren't completely right. DWV is what they said to get, when instead he meant NCS(or some other thing that started with an N). Well, we got it, and tomorrow were gonna finish everything that doesnt need the 6" pipe, because that's only used for the sliding portion. I'm gonna be taking pics on a digital camera every step of the way, so I'll put em in a .zip and send em out.  That's all for now, I'm gonna go plizay galaxies. See ya around!

      I left There.... because i got Galaxies! Galaxies is more fun most of the time anyway. But, none of you care, so why should I be talking about it?  Saw League of Extroadinary gentlemen today... it was actiony. Sean Connery was cool... hold on... ill finish in a sec... gotta watch conan  (30 minutes later)  It was a rerun :(. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes.  Sean Connery was also actioney. Everything he said was cool, and everything he did was cooler.   Punch! Punch! Action Phrase! Shoot! Punch!  ~change subject~  Tomata, (or this morning), my dad and I are gonna go down to Home Depot and get PVC for a drumbone :-D whooOO! This is gonna be so cool. I wanna do a performance with it, but i dont know where, or where im gonna find a drummer, bassist, guitarist, AND 3 people to hold the drumbone. I will sooner or later, tho. :-D  Oh, here's an amusing anec-dote.  On the way home from Extroadinary gentlemen, my dad asked me what was my favorite "extroadinary gentleman." I tried to say Sean Connery, but i messed up and said Shonery. So thats what I'm gonna call him from now on.  Tobey Macguire is The Tobe Kevin Bacon is The Bacon Sean Connery is Shonery.  :-D  Soon I'll find a way to post pictures of drumbone construction on this journal, so stay tuned!

      This is a conversation I had with a girl i know- I want to thank her again for letting me talk- she's one of the coolest and nicest people i know :)  ElizBell: so why dont u believe in God? lol i saw ur profile...im not gonna convince u dont worry lol i just wana see ur point of view if thats okay w/ u? ShuChoMouff: umm... hmm, where to begin ElizBell: LoL ShuChoMouff: :-D i love these conversations if the other person isnt trying to convert me, i just have trouble finding a starting point ShuChoMouff: and also i h8 doing em over aim, i cant express feelings thru aim like in real life ElizBell: lol haha yes i know what u mean! ShuChoMouff: hmm.... ElizBell: .. ShuChoMouff: First of all, i guess because there's no factual proof. I know, i know, the bible is real, blah blah blah, but how do you know? Just because the bible says its real? No, that can't be right. Where did it come from? ShuChoMouff: i dont believe in that blind faith stuff ShuChoMouff: doesnt work for me ElizBell: o okya ShuChoMouff: if were blind, how do we know its there? ElizBell: what about ur parents ElizBell: what do they believe in ShuChoMouff: my dad doesnt talk about it much, my mom doesnt ShuChoMouff: she used to when her parents forced her to, but when she got into college she said "wait a minute..." ElizBell: lol o. ElizBell: okay ShuChoMouff: i mean, about the blind faith thing....(gimme a sec to type) ElizBell: k ShuChoMouff: i believe that extra terestrials probably do exist, but not because of the alien signtings and crop circles and all that, thats all bull- because its improbable that somewhere in this huge universe, the same conditions wouldnt exist. The aliens may only be as far as we are, blowing eachother to hell and back with guns and violence. ShuChoMouff: its all coincidence- there is no fate, how is that probable? how is that logical? ElizBell: okay ShuChoMouff: The one thing i hate about the movie The Matrix is that it took alot of my ideas, so people keep saying i copied off that ElizBell: LoL o that sux ShuChoMouff: example "Do you believe in fate, neo?" "no." "Why not?" "because i dont like the idea that im not in control of my life" ElizBell: haha yea! ShuChoMouff: because i know that anything could change at any moment ElizBell: it can. ShuChoMouff: that i could be hit by a car, or shot in a driveby or something ShuChoMouff: and i know i wont wake up and see clouds and angels ShuChoMouff: ...or fire and brimstone... ElizBell: well hell isnt exactly that. ShuChoMouff: i think dying is probably like going to sleep, except you dont dream ShuChoMouff: yes thats true, it isnt ElizBell: hell means away from God.  ShuChoMouff: there are many visions of hell ShuChoMouff: yes, theres that ElizBell: right but  ElizBell: ..lol mk ShuChoMouff: then there are the layers and all that ElizBell: yeah ShuChoMouff: noone can agree on anything- thats another reason i know its not true ElizBell: so when u die, u think like, you will just like not wake up, and ur life is over? ElizBell: j/w ElizBell: thats how ya see it'/? ShuChoMouff: well, its been proven lately that when you think ANYTHING, a chemical is secreted into your brain ShuChoMouff: plus the electricity thing, which makes you live ElizBell: lol what does that mean?! ElizBell: WHAT ElizBell: lol ShuChoMouff: sorry, let me explain ShuChoMouff: they did some tests on some labrats about a year ago ElizBell: lol k ShuChoMouff: they taught this one rat how to run through a maza ShuChoMouff: and he got so good, he could do it in 4.3 seconds ElizBell: wow ShuChoMouff: they killed the rat, and took out his brain to examine it. (for the sake of science, lol) ElizBell: right right lol ShuChoMouff: they ended up feeding the brain to ANOTHER rat of the same species ShuChoMouff: so a rat ate another rat's brain ElizBell: uh huh ShuChoMouff: and they put that rat, who had NEVER gone through that maze before, into the maze. ShuChoMouff: you know how long it took that rat to complete the maze? ElizBell: how long ShuChoMouff: 3.5 seconds ElizBell: wow..why?! ElizBell: it was shorter..the time ShuChoMouff: the chemicals i was talking about ElizBell: yeah ShuChoMouff: turned it into instinct for the rat because its brain isnt as well developed- its not smart enough to stop that from happening ElizBell: jeez ShuChoMouff: so that makes it impossible to have a "soul" that floats to heaven, or hell, or wherever ShuChoMouff: although it would be nice to have an afterlife, it's most likely not true ElizBell: okay ElizBell: that was deep ElizBell: now my brain is tired ShuChoMouff: sorry about that, i get carried away. ShuChoMouff: lol ElizBell: So i think im gonan go ...lol its okay i enjoyed it. lol okay ill ttl tho ShuChoMouff: yes, thank you very much for letting me speak my mind :-)  I thought that was a good conversation.  Once her brain gets un-tired, lol, i hope we can continue that, i want to hear her thoughts on the matter. :-D

      My dad told me today that I looked(was acting) just like a blue man, with my posture and curious look on my face and all that. I didn't even do it on purpose. I need help, don't i?  Anyway, he and I are going to Home Despote on Saturday to get some PVC pipe to make a Drumbone with. You know, a drumbone? Percussive offshoot of a Trombone. Someone hits one section of PVC(the reed) with drumsticks, and you have 2 other sections you can slide part of the tube up and down to change the note. It's gonna be sweet as hell if i get to perform with it. I might do pasta, or Malvinas... somehting like that. Or the talent show. That'd be sweet. Just need 2 people....  Other than that, nothing new has happened. Matt wants to make a Backpack tubulum and sell it, but im not sure if he'd make any profit off of it after what you have to spend to get the PVC, the Vacuum tubes, the frame, and the measurements right.  Wanna help with drumbone construction? Gimme 25 dollars. Just kidding. REALLY wanna help? IM me l8r (shuchomouff... duh) and ill give you the details. Then you can give me the 25 dollars.

      OH MY SH*T!!! That storm was freakin INSANE!!!! You shoulda seen it. We were at the McDonalds on Story road and then in the middle of a storm, lightening hit the big M sign! The M is okay (thank goodness!) but the M, C, D, O, and N in the name McDonalds was blown out! we were outside and saw the manager picking up red pieces of plastic! Then, on that big stone house on Rochelle by brandenburg, their biggest tree was uprooted and landed like 10 feet from their house! All the other trees was fine tho.   I GOT CANDY!!! I forgot that i bought a BIG plastic bag of candy in boston! I havent even eaten it yet! :-O!

      Wow, i havent updated in a while. Prolly cuz there wasn't much to talk about, 'cept havin matt over, that was pretty coo....  Well, 4th. 4th 4th 4th. The trip to lindale was good, fireworks.... good..... trip home..... good..... still bored tho.  I'd been wanting to make a sword pole that the Blue Man Group uses for that 'swooshy' noise in their songs. I learned today that they are fiberglass rods that can bend and flex, and, couples with their light weight, make a satisfying  "woosh" noise when swung in the air.  What is a fiberglass rod, you ask?  Boat antennae(60 bucks), have a guy make it for you (100 bucks), Magicstick(25 bucks).... wait, was that 25 bucks? Yup. I found some sap that was selling what he THOUGHT was an electrician's prodding tool, but its actually an instrument used to make a noise not unlike that of a...... record scratching??? I've been hearing that bands out there are looking for a DJ soely for that sound, but i think an air pole is cooler, sounds better, and is funner to watch. Im probably also going to end up making a Drumbone (a percussive offshoot of a trombone, made with PVC pipes and connectors) by the end of the summer, if i get bored enough. That would only cost 30 bucks, what with us already having the saw, easy access to home depot, connectors and elbows not being too expensive.... I wonder how the people of home depot would think of a guy like me looking at their warehouse, not of a place of home improvement, but a music store? Hmm... I'm gonna need to think on this one.  Have you ever noticed that while you're listening to a song with a real good beat, and youre typing, you end up typing in tempo with the music? its hard, but my subconscious typing pulls it off... somehow.  skiddely wa doo wah day. Thank you.

      Well, the church lock-in is tonight, and my brother's birfday party is today as well.  For those of you in my English class, you know that Journal assignment we had to do, where we made up rules for our family to follow? I came up with another one.  3. If I have to help clean up for my brother's birthday party, then he has to help clean up for mine.  I'm excited about the lockin.   Looooooooocccckkkkk iiiiinnnnnnnnnuuuhhhhh.   What sucks is that we're supposed to help clean up the Horizon Players play, and i don't wanna, cuz I'm already sore, and i just wanna have some FUNNN...  I don't even wanna sit and watch the play, because the only reason i'm coming to this is to have FUNNNNNN.  And if they stick to their little schedule, it won't be.  Rebellion!

      Today, I met a guy that thought George Dubya should be able to.... do things.  My Spanish teacher has a picture of himself and dubya on his desk, and this jackass comes over and says "Is that bush? He's the man."  If it were after school, and... if he wasn't a boxer... He wouldn't have teeth for much longer.  George W. Bush is such a fucking lunatic asshole white trash redneck loser idiot fuckstick that he shouldn't be able to go down the stairs on his own.  I hate people so much.

      Whee, 25 hours & 30 minutes 'till the lockin!!!!  I'm excited about this because we haven't had a *good* lockin since OWL, and it's also the first time I take the (finished)drumbone anywhere.  Also, on sunday, we're talking about rhythms and stoof, and they wanted me to bring drumbone, so i'm not doing it just cuz i want to. It probably wouldn't be finished right now if i weren't bringing it.  I'm debating with myself over whether to bring the dulcimer, but i probably will end up not bringing it, unless everybody says "Jesse! Bring the dulcimer-of-happiness!" Then I'll talk to the all-around master of the dulcimer, my mom, and she'll probably say yes. I should get it tuned first. Or... find a way to tune it myself... what an amazing thought.

      I've been messing around with my mom's dulcimer... i have it in my room now... this thing is awesome, but i wish it had lower notes... like a cimbalom. i think i might try and find one on Ebay.  Just checked ebay, no cimbaloms for sale, but there was 1 CD with a guy performing on the cimbalom. Pfft.  Well, the homework isnt as bad as i'd thought it would be, but it's more than i had last year. I have to bring spirals to class now! Grrr...  You know what i just realized? I have NOTHING important to say! Nothing! Other than i'm totally psyched about this lockin on saturday because it's gonna kick ass, NOTHING is important right now!  Hey, charley, if you read this...  "And drumbone soup... and a drumbone TV special... and drumbone SOCKS!"

      Here's a note to all you poets out there. Speak ENGLISH!!!  So many poems i've read by people, and they would be great, except they replace "you" with "U" and "are" with "R", stuff like that, and it bothers me because it looks like they're being so immature and not sincere. Here's a little snippet my friend had in his profile... I'm not copying word-for-word because... well... he's not on.  "I love all of u. Y does god take away all the people u love?"  I was just thinking, "Are..... you kidding?"  Apparentally, he wasn't, but whatever.

      Well, school starts again tomata. This will be my first full week of school, because we only had it on Thursday and Friday last week, but that's because my district is comprised of a bunch of incompetent fools who spend all this money building statues and making their schools LOOK better, but can't afford 20 teachers in each school....  My schedule half-rocks, and half-sucks. Seeing as alot of my friends are in half my classes, and the other 4 i know NOONE. Well, i know 1 person in my spanish class, but only a little bit. I'm just glad i'm a friendly sonofagun, i can MEET people! It's too bad I hate most people. I h8 them so much i just wanna hit em with drumbone.        druuuuuuuuuuuuummmbone.           I wanna go down and play it, but it requires another set of hands and my family is sick and tired of it anyway. I should clone myself. OR better yet, get a mannequin*!   Well, there is going to be a lockin this saturday that i'm reeeeealy excited about, seeing as nothing exciting ever happens in school. It's a week away and i'm already jumpy about it. And partly it's the first time i'm gonna bring my (finished) drumbone anywhere. All of you people who WEREN'T there DIDN'T see my drumbone mishap at malvinas...... that was a bad day.  * = Thanks to Michael for the spelling

      The one reason I have always hated playing Massivley Multiplayer games is leaving them. You leave behind so many people that you are friends with, that you relate to, and chances are you will NEVER meet them again. I still feel remorse for when i left Active Worlds, that was probably the best experience i'd ever had in a game like that...  I still remember this person i knew named Charlotte... we started.... i think 5 towns together... good ones too, at least 6 people had lots and houses in our town. But then.... they raised the price from 20 bucks a YEAR to 12 bucks a month and everyone left.  You say i'm obsessed wif the internet, I say we lost some good people....

      My parents say that they might get me one of those electric drumsets... that'd be cool, because everybody knows my style... i do alot of electronic schtoof, and an electric one would 1. wouldn't replace a real drumset if i were to join a band, 2. take up less space, 3. cost less, and 4. have VOLUME CONTROL!!!  Let's see... PVC Instrument... drumbone... drumset... am i becoming a percussionist? Only time will tell... now i just have to get rid of this drumming-on-whatever-i-can-get-my-hands-on habit.

      Allright, tired of this I am. Stop putting these long-ass lyrics in your profile/away messages, noone wants to read them. Noone reads through them, lyrics don't have the same impact that the music does. I know a girl who's profile and away messages consist of LONG depressing lyrics by many stupid bands, and i wish she'd stop this charade. She is one of the nicest people i know, but i think Macarthur got to her head. Jesus, that school blows.  I'm also sick and tired of adults looking down on teenagers as a bunch of  depressed losers that serve nothing more than a drain on society. It's time to rise up, you bunch of depressed losers that serve nothing more than to drain society!  You may not have noticed this about me, but I'm not like many other people. I'm a smart-alleck, but not in the way that makes teachers say "allright, enough out of you, TO THE OFFICE!!!"  I wish people weren't such assholes.  I know this post doesn't make much sense, my mind is just racing to beat itself right now.

      Anyone who hasn't seen that Most Extreme Elimination show on Spike TV(although its made in japan) should do themselves a favor and bomb japan. This shit shouldn't be allowed to go on any more.  Let me quote something i said during a conversation just a minute ago---  ShuChoMouff: people on this show get their bones broken, teeth smashed in, one game involves the contestant getting starved for 3 days, then have to gather more food than anyone else.  Should we allow this to go on? I say... NAY!!! Bomb japan! Stop this shit!

      Allright, people have been reading my posts and have been telling me stuff like "Oh, you think you're so perfect? that everyone is flawed except you?" and I had been thinking of a way to prove those people wrong without my usual "Fuck you and your pretentious hipocrisy" Just now, i had an embarassing experience i'm going to share with you. So, without further adooooooo...  Just now, i was sitting here and i was listening to music, and without knowing it, i got really into it, what wif picking up drumsticks and making a commotion.  Then me mom came in and got scared i was gonna hit her.  I'm still slapping myself.  Allright, that was a stoopid story and i deserved to be punished for telling it. BUT! it was embarassing. So fuck you and your pretentions hipocrisy.

      Holy shit on a shingle! I actually learned somefing in english today! AND it works to our advantage in making school start earlier! Apparentally, teenager's brains don't start working until 10:00 in the morning! I WAS RIGHT! I always tell people that I'm never officially awake until 10:30 in the morning, and I was near right all along.  I learned about how when someone tells you something, a little marker is zapped into the brain, and it's not actually learned until you SLEEP, when the marker is turned into a neuron connection in your brain.  Ha ha! Fuck you, hypocrites! Learning actually DOESN'T happen in the classroom, Mr. "I'm so smart i shit my pants im so smart" fuckinheimer!  Reading Rainbow lied to me. KERA in general lied to me. And my teef hurt like hell.

      Dammit, Dammit, DAMMIT!!! I HATE THE WORLD!!!!! Only in the ass-fucked up world we live in do people put metal shit in people's mouths that hurt 24/7 and say that it's "helping you."  It's fucking COSMETICS!! They try and convince me that having an impacted toof will hurt later in life, where in all logic it should hurt like SHIT now. How the fuck is it supposed to hurt when i'm 30, when i stop growing at 17? How is overbite... bad?  People don't seem to notice this about me, but I really don't give a flying FUCK what i look like to other people. People don't think i'm up to "standard?" I say, go fuck yourself, i have better shit to be doing than spending 3 hours on a treadmill, fuck- that thing feels like you're running nowhere, i call it the fucking guilt-trip machine.  Flossing is fucking overrated. I barely ever floss, and if i do, it's usually because i'm going to the dentist. I went to the dentist yesterday, not one cavity. I brush my teef, but i don't get in there and brush for 5 minutes like they tell ya to. And i still got no cavities. I have a waterpick for flossing, but i don't wanna use it because it gets water fucking everywhere, and it takes an hour to set up.  "What are ya doin, snider? ya get firsty?"  "No, I'm flossin! Damn, my teef hurt!"  On a semi-different topic...  I recently told someone that if my orthodontist gets any more bright fucking ideas about messing with my teeth for another year, i was gonna hit her. Then I thought, "oh, maybe i shouldnt say that, cuz shes a woman." Then i thought "well, i'd do the same for a man." So, I guess I'm in favor of equality.  Well, the family wants me to watch Mr. Deeds wif em, i guess i'll go.

      It's the last day of summer...  It feels like so short a time, but then i thought back to boston and it felt like it happened a long time ago... I guess time can have that effect on you.  I'm not going to say that school starting is good or bad- it'll be great to see my friends again, get back me laptop, work on flash, all that good stuff, but...  My core classes stress me out so much it isn't funny... If i ever have to have Ms. Garling as my teacher ever again i'm going to end up eating her. She's not what most people would call "Predictable." Well, sort of.  You'd walk into the room, and there were a couple factors that told you how a day in her class was gonna be.  1. The looks on other classmate's faces(happy, pissed off, scared)  2. The overall feel(on a bad day, you can kinda walk in and feel her pissed-off ness... kinda like... a "pissed-mist") I'll post back later. I'm busy.

      I was cleaning up the back room today, and the last task was to bring one of our vacuum cleaners that was out for some reason(the kind that looks like R2-D2 with a hose sticking out of him) and i decided to take the hose first, which would have made it easier in the long run...  I took the hose out, and i expected to have to tug more, and when it came out easily, i dropped it, and it made this note... it sounded awesome... so i picked it up, and hit it... same note. Hit it on the end of it, sounded even better... and I thought "This is my material for my PVC instrument.... heheheheheeh"  I found a paddle-like thing in the kitchen that came with the rice cooker, I'm gonna buy 6 more of them to use as paddles(i'll prolly make the 3 person one), and a couple mouse pads to savage and cut so the paddles will be softer. I did hit it with a mouse pad and it made an awesome sound, so i figured i'd put 2 and 2 together....

      My friend's profile:  I was watching "101 Things Removed From the Human Body" and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM said "I'm the luckiest person in the world for surviving this." And the whole time I'm thinking WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!?!?! You're not lucky!!! You have a friggin BOAT ANCHOR sticking out of your head!!!   He's right, you know. You're one of the most unlucky bastards in the world.

      Oh man, I have just been laughing my ass off at stuff today. All this funniness at once is kind of frightening... :-D  Like, at TGC today, we were playing Jedi Knight(don't stop reading, it gets stupider), to mess with me, Todd made his name "jesse=one_testicle" Now, this isn't true, and it made me fall over laughing, and then i went up to hit him, and then he hit me... not hard, just to the point where we both almost fell on the floor laughing, i'm still laughing about it as I write this...  Then, i went to www.threebrain.com (they made Gonads and Strife! wweeeeee!), and they have this new comic called Texties, where the 2 characters are smiley faces turned sideways in text, I'll post it here. For legal reasons, please know that this is NOT mine, it is totally threebrain's thing.     I just saw it and it made me laugh so much.... im still laughing, again. 2 times the laughter! It's like watching conan o'brien and south park at the same time!!!

      SECOND update: I hate it even MORE! it won't even let me link to it! Grrrrrrr, ask me and I'll send it to you over AIM- COA people will get to see it tomorrow.  UPDATE: God, I HATE yahoo! It's the only web host I have and it wont let me post pictures! So here, goto  urlLink The Martin Luther King picture  so you can see it.  You know what that is? It's a picture of my Martin Loofer King ACTION figure! I took it with my digital camera. Isn't it awesome? It had a podium, but i lost it when i was 7. Hard to believe I kept up wif this thing all these years. Sorry there's crap in the background, directly behind him is me retainer case, under the power switch is a ticket stub for... ~looks at ticket stub~ The core...(thats been there a while), and behind it... some notes i drew on a note card while playing Myst(i'm such a dork), that blue thing is something that came with my Tarot Cards(which i want to start working with again...) and my kick-ass own-all computer(at least to normal people) to the right.  Well, I guess I'll go on a picture taking frenzy of wierd things i have... like.... my dart board i dont have any darts for, and my AOL CD collection.

      Allright, The Rugrats needs to be stopped. Shit, they are the worst parents in the history of history.  Ya know the episode that happened today? The parents took the babies to the car wash, and LEFT the babies in the CAR with the windows OPEN while the car was in the wash! They almost freakin drowned! And that little spoiled bitch Angelica only made it worse, by opening the sunroof so the babies are showered in shampoo that could seriously do damage if they swallowed it.  Next one, the grandpa takes the babies to a park while it's like 105 degrees outside, and LEAVES them there. That's right, he goes to the other side of the park to talk to some people. he even wrecks the water supply by breaking a pipe, so the water fountain the babies were using gets cut off. Tommy almost dies of fucking sunburn. If it wasn't for that arabian baby who's parents seem to be also non-existant, they probably would have died.  Is  The Rugrats  a "don't let this happen to your children" video? Seriously, if my parents were that fucking stupid, I'd eat them. Or send them to a big factory where stoopid people are eaten. But they're not, so they're lucky.

      I was talking to Chloe, and I had one of those wierd inner-personal thoughts(all of you guys in COA apply):  Where would I be right now, what would I be even doing this second, if my parents hadn't signed me up for OWL in 8th grade?  I don't know how i could have survived the past couple years without knowing this many people that knew exactly what I was going through- I'd probably be so insecure these days... not knowing that there were people who thought like i do.  Seriously, I thought it was me and Todd, and that was it. It basically still IS it, noone else besides Todd, Syed and I in irving are actively non-christian.  I have to thank the COA people for all the good times, all the funny times, all the serious times.  I hope everybody still has their little flame we got in OWL. I would wear mine, but i need to find a bigger loop for it, it chokes me :).  All the times we laughed with eachother, all the times we got back at eachother.  I know this all sounds cheesy, especially for those of you who don't know what i'm talking about, but seriously, in retrospect, which one of you were REALLY looking forward to OWL? I know I wasn't. I didn't want to go. Now where are we? It's only friday(technically saturday... whatever) and I already can't wait until our little hour and a half 'class' on sunday morning. I loved every minute of boston. Like I said when I started this webjournal, i don't think anybody else could have made that trip anywhere near as good as it was.  And so... in no particular order...  AJ: Definitley... different. You were one of the main factors I ended up staying awake all night at the lockins, and why I stayed up so late in boston. Always something new :-D You seriously rock, man.  Chloe: Really, what can I say that can accurately describe you? Hillarious, intelligent, respectable, intelligent, insightful, intelligent, funny, did I mention intelligent? There aren't enough words in the english language*, should I switch to German? Nein, I shall not.   *That I can think of right now- you have to remember- it's 1:15 in the morning when i wrote this.   Erik: You missed boston, but still you are always up for doing some crezzy schtoof, and for that i have to commend you.  Katie: Definitley the one who kept us from getting way out of hand, I can't IMAGINE what kind of trouble we would all be in if katie hadn't been there to knock some sense into our dense, misguided heads. We definitley have to thank you for that one. You're a great person as well, I bet I speak for everyone when I say that a large chunk portion of the 'soul' of the boston trip if you hadn't made it...  Douglas: Definitley one of the most sensible people I have ever met, also one of the main reasons we all didn't get killed on the subway :-D Always up for a laugh, you were a great help raising money for the boston trip, and you also stepped forward to have a picture party, I seriously doubt anyone would have made that initiative.  Sarah: Whoo, good times, eh? My head is still itching from that salt. You often were the one who taught us that sometimes it's good to stray from the rules, that you have to go out on a limb sometimes to make things work. Remember the Wizard of Oz party? Methinks you were the one who figured out the winning combination, even though i almost made us suffer a broken board :-O ... We sure got gary back, that'll teach him not to mess with us. Unbreakable. Never a dull moment.  Nick: Where'd ya go, guy? We're still in touch though, FCOHE is going strong and has no sign of slowing down!  Carly: Our UU/Horizon pro, also one of the most thoughtful people i've ever met. Thanks for the Blue Man Group newspaper article! I'll have fun reading it :-D You were i think the biggest help from the team in raising money, weren't you the REASON we have that extra $1400 left in the funds? It was your hard work(and burned hands) that set COA on the right track to money-dom. You probably deserve more of a share of the money then the rest of us do(assuming we split it... hehehe).  That's my 2 cents(2 dollars) for today- I bet I'm forgetting a person or two that deserves to be on here, but it's 1 in the morning, i've been up for over 18 hours, time for the bed. If I did forget anybody, please tell me before said forgotten person(s) feels bad, and I can edit this post.  -Snider  P.S. I would have written a song or something, it's really a pity that I have NO musical talent whatsoever(cant play guitar, can barely play piano), except the drumbone, and i'm experimenting with my mom's dulcimer, but right now all I have are words. Bon Appetit'

      As you may have noticed, I finally updated my links to the right ---->  What took me so long? Probably because blogger is an asshole and provided no easy way to fix the links, so i had to go in there and search through HTML. That's why more people do MeloDramatic- one, it's made for rebellious angst-filled teenagers, and 2. it requires no HTML. That's why i use blogger, to feel superior. :-D

      Dammit, now EVERYONE is making a webjournal. Usually it'd be a good thing, but i have this nasty habit of reading them, and now i have to read like 6. Do you know how much time it takes to 1. load the page(i know mine can be VERY slow sometimes) 2. read it and 3. make sure you didnt miss any other entries? A LOT!  Anyway, onto my next topic.  If i ever catch you referring to something as "gay" when you mean "stupid" or "overly unintelligent," you're getting punched in the nose. This is your warning.  Gay doesn't = stupid! It has 2 meanings, you know which two. And if you don't, fuck you, you're lying. You know which 2.  I say homophobia, even when i refer to people who hate gays/think its wrong, because those people have NO FUCKING business talking about it. It's not wrong, or disgusting, you're just too afraid to let it go. My best friend, whenever something gay happens on tv, he asks me the same question: "Don't you think gay sex is wrong?" and I always give him the same answer. "No, because we have no business talking about it." then we get into the same fucking conversation about how I'm convinced that it's biological, and some people just don't realize it until later, and he says "no, some are born gay, but some become it later" and I say "No, they're just expected to like girls, and they try to, and realize they can't." If he wasn't one of the most kick-ass people in the world otherwise i would put him on my "Deserves to be eaten" list.  Topic #3:  " asdf pso for a minute "  can SOMEBODY explain to me what this means?  Somebody i know has this as their away message, and it pisses me off, because 1. it probably means nothing, and 2. asdf is what they use in that fucking typing class to tell us "where to start" in typing. I already knew how to type, i taught myself. But still, i had to pretend like i was using the slow-ass method of keeping your fingers on the middle of the keyboard in that uncomfortable position, then when the dumb-ass teacher walked along past me, i'd speed up in my normal method again. THEN she has the nerve to tell my PARENTS that i'm hunting and pecking! What the hell, i wanted to slap her!(on more than one occasion, like how we didnt even see a computer in COMPUTER CLASS until half the fucking semester was over). You people from travis who had her know what i mean...  Anyway, I'm getting off-topic, back to "asdf pso for a minute."  Half that fucking sentence was an abbreviation!  Gimme an A!  Gimme an S!  Gimme a D!  Gimme an F!  I'm one of the people that would hear the cheerleaders say that crap and I would yell something like "No, fuck you!" for each letter. You know how i feel about cheerleaders from an earlier post.  I'm done for now, they better have fixed my game by now... grrrrr.....

      I'm kind of in a surreal mood right now. I'm sleepily tired, listening to Venus Hum, I'm leaning back in my chair....  Not a thought in the world, just emotion... doesn't happen very often...  Kind of a feeling that I'm alone... everything seems so far away right now...  I could just be feeling lightheaded because I'm sleepy, but i don't know, i still think i have normal judgement...  I imagine i am feeling around how people feel when they have those real eye-opening experiences, where nothing in the world matters except what it's like they meant to focus on... except I have nothing to focus on...  I guess i'm focusing on the lyrics to this song, but i don't see any connection... Maybe it's some of those words that stick with you for a long time... until you find their meaning, could be days, could be weeks, months, years later, then either they float away like all other memories, or become even more important.... becoming an important factor on the way your life turns out.  I guess I won't know tonight...  I guess I should also note that the words aren't the only factor, the music is probably the biggest factor in getting that emotion...  If you want to hear what I am talking about, find/download  Venus Hum- Wordless May . Trust me- if you stop what you're doing it, and just listen, hopefully you'll hear it the way I do.  -snider.  P.S. I'm not becoming christian. Just because the word jesus is in a song doesn't make it christian. Muslims believe in jesus. And they're not christian. I don't want to deal with you converters right now.

      I haven't updated in a day or so... here's what's been happening...  BLUE MAN CONCERT!!! We(Eric, AJ and I) saw it last night, it was totally mind-blowing and awesome.  Was it worth it, guys? I think so.  Matt, i should have told you this, but i think at 8:00 last night(when the concert started) you should have set fire to the beach for keeping you away. Ha! Stoopid galveston.  Wow... my birfday is in exactly 5 months!  I'm sorry that i'm not pissed off at anything today, i'm just in a good mood. Trust me, i'll be back to my tortured teenage self tomata.

      I was talking to my friend today, and he asked me if i had any spare computer parts, and I said "Well, I have 2 crappy speakers you can have." He passed up the offer. Later, I offered him 2 crappy speakers and my old crappy mouse that didn't have a scroll button and it wasn't optical, and he still refused. Here's the chat transcript of what happened just a second ago.  ShuChoMouff: I am offering to give you ShuChoMouff: a crappy mouse, 2 crappy speakers, and... ShuChoMouff: ready for this? a r n  l e e: uh huh ShuChoMouff: a crappy mousepad. a r n  l e e: OMG a r n  l e e: DEAL ShuChoMouff: hahaha a r n  l e e: FUX0RIN DEAL YO ShuChoMouff: it's really too bad that i don't have the mousepad.  Hahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha.  "fux0rin deal yo"

      Oh my shit, i KNOW all of you read my August 1st entry, I think some of you people just are doing it to piss me off. AND IT'S WORKING!!! So... fucking cut it out! If anything, my rant on the 1st has made people's english skills WORSE!!  A bunch of my friends have gone from talking in fairly normal english, to having every other word be U or R, talking in all fucking CAPS and the CAPITOLS become lowercase and it's SO RETARTED!!!!  Swear to god(goddess?), someone said this to me the other day:  "y r u not goin 2 tgc wif us?"  And that doesn't piss me off(even though it still does) as much as when the other person just doesn't make any fucking sense.  Guy: I don't have basic cable. Guy: I'm waiting to get dsl. Me: DSL has nothing to do with TV Guy: So my sister's friend can get us cable tv Me: wtf? Guy: Yeah you can.  If that made any kind of sense to you, you're a freakin visionary.  I'd talk about it more, but i've been having this bad virus or something awful ever since I've gotten back from boston and I fucking hate it. Every day sometimes i get sick. 2 nights ago, i couldn't move it hurt so bad.

      I would like to make an announcement to all people who share their buddy lists with other people.  I swear to god, the next person who gives someone i don't know my screenname is NOT going to have their legs very much longer.  There is a little trend going around where you share your whole buddy list with someone else.  DON'T DO THAT!!!!  Screennames are private property, and are NOT allowed to be given to ANYONE else without MY permission!  I'm too pissed to talk about this right now, I need to try and get some sleep, I have church in the morning(Not christian church, get a life.)

         Remember when Cheerleading used to be only a backup of a sport? They were there to cheer on football players(hence the name), and boost morale so they would win the game.     Now, the cheerleaders are having independent thoughts(you knew it would happen, bear with me), and now think that they are a sport of their own. No, you're not.     I was watching one of those UCA championships and i was sitting there, confused out of my mind, looking at the TV screen, trying to figure out what the cheerleaders were cheering for.     They would explain it as "it's difficult! you have to stand on eachother and move in formation! it's a sport in itself!" Fuck you, you're backup. That's it. I don't know who you think you are, but what you are doing isnt cheerleading, it's dancing with a bunch of obnoxious yelling.     I keep seeing ads for "CHEER!", this video that teaches you to cheer, and i had to turn away in disgust at the huge smiles these shallow soulless teenagers have painted on their overly round heads. Now I know why people say that white people have no soul.     While I'm here, I'd like to state that California has gone COMPLETELY FUCKING INSANE!!!  Arnold Schwartzenegger Gary Coleman Peter Gallagher The pervert that whacked off so much he lost his legs  Well, if the christian apocalypse is true, this is it.  I can't even make jokes about it, it's too wierd already.  I hope you're happy, fucking evangelists, screwed california over before the rest of us.

      Recently I got a massivley Multiplayer game called Second Life, where you can basically be and do whatever you want. I was messing with  the character creation system, and i realized that you could change your skin blue. Hmm...   Without further adooo, i give you my Blue Man Character!           I had them posted on www.bluemanlibrary.com... check it out- for right now it's the top news story!  I know, i know, the pictures are stretched too far, the game HAD to make them widescreen :-D

      I just saw one of the funniest commercials I've ever seen since that Tabasco sauce commercial where the guy eats so much tabasco sauce, that mosquito sucks his blood and flies off and explodes.  Anyway, this one was for that Sportscenter show on ESPN, but while the show is crap, the commercials are sometimes amusing.  What happened was, there were 2 baseball players casually sitting in a house, one reading, the other one just staring at his feet. The one staring at his feet says "Ya know what's wierd?"  "What?"  "It's wierd that they call us whitesox, when we wear black socks?"  "No, it's not that wierd."  Then he said something that sounded like "But isn't it wierd that their pole is on their side of the field?(i dont know either)"  "No, that's not wierd either. You know what is wierd?"  "What?"  He points towards the window. "That."  The guy looking at his socks casually looks out the window, and you see a bunch of people in animal costumes and jester costumes dancing around a very colored maypole. He casually looks back. "Yeah, it is."  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah

      I saw Johnny English today, and while it was funny, it just seemed too damn short. I thought "Oh crap, it's over? what?" then i bet people gave me funny looks when i fell on the ground and started having seizures. after that, i was all sticky from the theater floor :(  What really bothered me was the french evil guy. French people can't be evil! Was that guy even really french? That accent of his was too annoying and garbled that i couldn't tell if it was real or not. Sometimes I wasn't even sure if he was speaking english.  Did anyone notice that when they went to france, they were still driving with the drivers seat on the left side? Only the english do that.  Rowan Atkinson was hillarious, but sometimes i was confused about how sometimes he did something really well, and sometimes he messed up badly, but somehow found a clever excuse for it.  A warning for the weak-stomached- this movie has almost as much man-ass as Jackass: The Movie did. And that's more than should ever be seen, ever(thank goodness for the miracle of movies and television!). And it was british, hairy man ass. Be advised. I say advised instead of warned because i know a couple of you out there would like to see man-ass, and though i don't know any of you(i think), you are free to do as you please with all the disgusting man-ass.  Allright, enough man-assing around! I've got to get to bed, i need to get my sleep straightened out before school starts! (oh, i see some of you are getting mad and picking up pitchforks. Did I say the secret word? Hey, watch out there, buddy! I don't like pointy obj-- OW!!! AAHHHHHH!!!!)

      I know you all have seen those idiotic sentences that people are putting into their profiles. "If you love jesus christ, show it by copying and pasting this into your profile!" We all had our laughs, some friends and i made fun of them by posting "If you love the devil, copy this and paste this into your profile." and "If you worship the holy goddess of pants, copy and paste this into your profile." it was no big deal, just a joke. But i saw something just now that made it so stupid, that it deserved an entry in here.  It seems someone has "adapted" the "If you love jesus" sentence into non-english! Fucking incredible! Here's what it says now on a girl's profile i know.  "If you love Jesus Christ then show it by copying and pasting this sentence in2 ur PRO"  I honestly thought that the christians thought that English was "god's language," so by saying that they're basically saying the following:  "JESUS I TINK U R A FAGOT AND NEED 2 DYE!!!"  Am i right? they actually took the time to retard-ify the jesus christ sentence!  Okay, onto me next topic-  Yesterday kicked ass for me, and ya know why? Because i performed the drumbone at Malvina's coffeehouse! And i did audio.  The drumbone is still not finished, AND it fell apart halfway through(hehe),  we werent even playing the song, we were having a jam where they passed out shakers and stuff, and i had my drumbone brought up so i could participate. Everybody thought it was a tuba. It was so fun. It's really too bad that NOONE from church showed up! God, you coulda helped! It woulda been better.... Oh well, it still kicked ass.  I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 1, so yeah it was tiring.  I think someone took pictures but i seriously doubt i'm ever going to get them.  Oh well, thats all for now... time for some breakfast... i mean lunch... whatever.

      Well, I've thought about it, and i've figured out what the 2 greatest weapon ideas in the history of anything are. I couldn't figure out which one was better, so they're tied.  And the winner is...  The Disc from TRON  and  The Lightsaber from StarWars!  Do you agree? Of course you do! I'm a clown-pirate! I will EAT YOU!!!!  Something has been bothering me- people who get on AIM, but don't want to chat to people.  I know a couple people who leave their instant messenging program on all day and their profile/away message says something like "Don't talk to me, go away, I don't feel like chatting."  And I have one question for those people.  ARE YOU STOOPID!??!?!!?  Instant Messenging programs are made for one thing, and one thing only. Chatting. AIM and other IM programs may have other features, like ads(:-O), Stock/News Tickers, but who the hell uses those? They're unreliable! AIM clearly states under its stock ticker(if youre not using Dead AIM, a fine program if i do say so myself), "information at least 15 minutes late."  "Holy shit! I've been ass-broke for 15 minutes? I just bought ALL the memorabilia from Star Trek AND all the magic cards in the world on ebay!"  It doesn't HAPPEN!!!! If you're not gonna chat/dont have any reason to get on (sometimes even I don't chat, but that's because sometimes i CAN'T and i post my phone number up so people CAN call me and CHAT!!!), then get off the damn internet, you're lagging everybody else up... :-D  That means- don't keep your AIM on if you're going away for a week, don't keep AIM on if you just had a fight with your friend and don't want to talk. Stuff like that, it's simple.  And also, I have one more thing to say that's semi-on-this-topic.  ATTENTION ALL TYPERS WHO USE ABBREVIATIONS!!! Please, PLEASE learn to type in ENGLISH!!!  I am sick and tired of "hy man, how r u 2day? I tink its tyme to go 2 t3h m4ll and watch sum movies, blahh dee blahh de FUCKIN DA!!!"  It's not fucking hard! "ttyl" doesn't cut it! I don't want to be told that you will TTYL, because that's not a word. Can you pronounce it?" I know I can't. Bye! See ya! It's not hard! Bye is even shorter than TTYL! So that means ttyl isn't even an abbreviation! Fucking incredible.  Some abbreviations are acceptable, but that's because it's really useful. Can you express laughing in text? I can't. I can type while having a whole different conversation in real life, but I can't express laughter in text format. That's why it's okay to use "LOL","lmao","Rofl", all those different kinds of things, but only when used sparingly, in between long sections of English.  Most Emoticons(Smiley faces) are fine as well. You probably often see me use ":-O" or "X-P" or ":-D" and more on regular occasions, because it's easier than typing "I'm smiling right now."  I just thought of another topic, but in an effort to not piss off my readers, I'll just keep it safely hidden away in a tiny lock-box until next time. Until then, always remember to get your protein, and BUY A BIKE.

      I feel... nauseated.  They got me high, and I hated it. I'd rather be knocked out next time.  I couldn't understand what was going on. I kept looking at the ceiling, but i couldn't move my head. I could feel the armrest, and I could feel the bloodpressure thing on my arm, but it's like the world had stopped...  They had turned the gas off. I didn't know. I thought for sure this was gonna suck, because either i had built up a tolerance like superman, or they had it on a timer and didn't know.  When they turned it back on, I almost said "goodbye." before I went under. Wouldn't have done any good, though. I was already numb.  Everybody says that everybody's voice is like an echo, but it's more like a large hall, and it was almost like i'd heard what they were saying before. One huge deja-vu trip.  Wierdest thing was- I couldn't tell them that the gas was torturing me. They would ask me questions, and I would respond. I couldn't tell them to turn the gas off, or down. They'd say "how're ya feelin?" and I'd respond with something reminiscent of a thumbs up, or a nod, or something. They asked me if the gas was working, and I couldn't help but smirking, she said "i saw you getting a little goofy-faced."  I wonder if they realized how much i was sweating...  I was lost in the ceiling, that's all that mattered... the two heads looming over me were just kind of pushed to the side... There wasn't really any feasable thing to explain... except for what I heard.  I'd say about half of it was me trying to make sense out of what i was hearing, and the other half was my pulse monitor, and the dentist's chatter.  You know that acid music that you hear, that just... it's just so. ... stoned.  That's what it was, it wasn't music, but me trying to understand it filled up the half-hour or so needed for the surgery. If that.  I honestly don't know what was going to happen when I sad down in the chair... they took my blood pressure about half a million times, and then she put the mask on... first my feet... then my arms... slowly, my body just drifted off into nothingness, and i was just... there. Me.... and the ceiling.  I never want to see the dentist again.

      :-O surgery was 3day, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it... well, i didnt even think it would be bad. I just didn't wanna go. Worst part was getting numb. I HATE getting numb. The pain I can deal with. I'm still numb.  I'm listening to White Rabbit after all that laughin gas... :-O  I'm still against drugs, but to hell if that didn't make it go by faster.

Some girl's profile:  "i jus dont no ne more everything iz goin rong:-\:-(:'("  my h8 mail:  "Well, speak English for a change and maybe people won't think yer stoopid!"  See?

      I just noticed something... you know those strange e-mails ive been getting from "myself?" I just got 2 more. One from someone named Georgette G. Meyer, with the subject "I saw you in the chatroom" and nothing in the body of the message.  The next one was from my e-mail address again, and the subject was "your password" , but again, there was nothing in the body of the message.  I was about to delete it, but then I looked at the filesize of the message. 122k. The one from Georgette was 1k. How could it be 122k if there is less information than the other one? If you have any ideas, tell me- I'm still confused.  UPDATE- i tried to experiment, and i forwarded it to myself... and it gave me a syntax error with a wierd thing in the address bar that i've never seen... cid:C16Td4OM3f2JhiH3.  Could this be the password? I'm still confused, but I'm starting to think this is something big.

      Dammit. Dammit dammit DAMN IT like a MONKEY!1!1  I has to get surgery on toosday to get this impacted tooth of mine "exposed", so they can put another bracket on it, and pull it up into place.  Booooohullll crahhhappp!!!! Grr, that's another year down the fucking drain having metal in my mouff, and thats not including the time i'll be out because of the damn anesthetics.  I was reading the list of "risks" i would be taking when i'd be put under, one of them stated that i may have numbness in my mouth for weeks, months, years, or sometimes- permanent. Everything else i could deal with, but numbness permanently? I'm confused, but i could have sworn that the reason i was getting this surgery done in the first place was to not have my nerve cut(which would produce none other than NUMBNESS).  THEN, guess what. Later on in the year I have to get my wisdom teeth removed. All 4 of them!  My parents try to make me feel better... "you get to miss school! hooray!" and I respond with "And i'll have trouble eating and sleeping for the next forever, and even if i do eat anything, i wont be able to chew very well, because of the NUMBNESS... hooray!"  I have to be asleep for the wistom teeth removal, but for the first one, my parents want them to give me laughing gas. Apparentally they don't know how fucking hard i laugh. I know, i know, it doesnt 'actually' make you laugh, its supposta relax you... but i dont know how it's gonna work with me being all "relaxed," trying to strike up a conversation, but end up not being able to talk because of the numbness...  "He.... Heh.... HeyyyY!!! look at meshhhh!!! heheheheehe... im getting my gumfs cut!"  and the dentist would be all  "you gotsa calm down now foo! i is tryin to fix yer teef!"  and the nurse would all be a gamer and be all like  "j00 s1t d0wN amd 1 g1vex0rz j00 an muff1n! T3hnm 1 hax0rs j00r pceh and stoeled yuor megahurtz1!!!"  ^^if you could read that, good job- i didnt even look at the screen... or the keyboard.  Anyway, I just had a conversation with a friend, and i was gonna type this, but i dont feel like it, so ill just post the log.  ahsboomer: why ShuChoMouff: because it's a son-of-a-bitch and wont come in right ShuChoMouff: my dentist even said "its retarted" ShuChoMouff: apparentally i'm an unusual case ShuChoMouff: and apparentally my orthodontist is incompetent and doesnt know that my wisdom teeth are coming in.  That's right, my orthodontist is a shit and can't even xray my teeth when shes supposed to, shes too busy remodeling her office. So she's trying to separate my teeth, and at the same time my wisdom teeth are pushing their way up, undoing all her work, and then my wisdom teeth are gonna cut off my nerves so i'll be paralyzed(or numbed) in the chin, which will SUCK, so were gonna take the xray to her, and tell her basically to pull her head out of her ass and compensate.  Ooh, and guess what? When they knock me out to do the surgery, I'm not allowed to eat for 8 hours before! Those assholes wanted to give me an AFTERNOON appointment!!! That means i'd have to wake up at like 2 in the morning if i was gonna eat anything. No, fuck em, i'll just go a week later and get it done in the morning. W8! that lockin's the day after! SHIT! Well, i'll just do it on that friday. Or tuesday. Whatever.  My mom is concerned that she's gonna have to let my dad take me on the appointment day, because she has school. She might even skip her classes. WHY?!?!? It's not like i'm performing a floorshow or anything. In fact, i might not even wanna talk! *gasp!* What's she gonna do, sit there for 48 hours while i wallow away, being numb and not eating anything?  It seems too convienient. It's like the tooth conditions were created so the dentists would have jobs. It's wierd, both my brother and I have these wierd impacted teeth conditions, and my parents never needed braces. It's a conspiracy!!!! Dammit, they're putting something in our food now. I hate the world.

      Over the past month, every time I've thought of something worth mentioning, i've written it down in a "random thoughts" text file, and i was gonna post it on here once it got long enough. Well, it's long enough.  Disclaimer- These were thought of over the course of a month, so none of them are related. The entries in quotation marks were not said by me. Some of these thoughts were just for me, some were inside jokes, but i think you'll get a good number of them. here you go- random thoughts, month 1.    -I think Cap'n Crunch promotes destruction of property.  -I don't associate myself with people that tYpE EvERy woRd LiKe ThIs RoFl StFu!!!!  -I like jazz music, but I can only take it in small doses.  -Buttered toast = happiness.  -Canada.  -I can't be a Blue Man because I don't smoke.  -"Sometimes I say 'Shit.'"  -My brother's friends know to stay away from me. ~backhands palm~  -"It really doesn't say much for the human race when the transsexual is the best looking woman in the room."  -Canadia.  -Boom... Boom Boom...... Boom..... Boom Boom......  -No, further TOWARDS the kill-zone, please!  -I love the smell of the blue man paint. It's non-toxic, too, so... wheeeeee!!  -Mia was onto something when she mentioned "Musical Communication"....  -I haven't learned a damn thing in chemistry.  -Canaduhmuhduh.  -I've decided that any white person who has ever said "That's gay, dogg" is not worthy of my attention.  -Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second. How exactly do you like someone "Aloty?"  -All of the sudden, a whole bunch of white people turned into black people, and a whole bunch of black people turned into complete wimps.  -I think I found something that the whole world can finally agree on: Pirates kick ass.  End.

      Don't you hate it when you can't have a normal conversation with people on AIM? It's those 2 or 3 people who do wierd and stupid things like don't answer when you talk to them until you say something like "fine, dont talk to me..", the people who always, ALWAYS respond with one word answers. Bugs the hell out of me. If it werent for some cool people on aim, i'd quit using it. It's too useful.

      My brother and my dad went to see that movie Underworld... and I don't wanna see it because the whole movie is one color. Am I the only one who realized that? The whole movie is this dark dreary movie that would probably either give me a headache, or cause me to fall asleep(probably both) if i had to watch that crap for an hour and a half.  I don't give a crap about vampires or werewolves. How are werewolves advanced enough to put UV rays in their freakin BULLETS again? I thought they were man-dogs.

      I was in an event in There... talking about buddhism, and I asked one of the "house buddhists" about meditation, and they kept mentioning "watching your breath until you can't stand it anymore," but they wouldn't clarify any more than that. I asked them about music, and they dismissed it as "a distraction." This is not true. Well, for some music. Rap/country/rock DOES fit into the "distraction" category. Rock has always been a distraction for me.  Jazz, Electronic(i hesitate to call it techno or trance, because it isn't either of those things), Blue Man Group... all great stuff.  I asked them "What if you make your own music?" and they dismissed THAT is "Making your own distraction." I guess that's another reason I'm not buddhist. Without music, I would go insane.  "Needing something... desire... Nirvana is a place without desire." that's what they said. Humans don't work without desire. It just doesn't happen.  My inspirations music-wise-  Pat Metheny group- Vocals don't ALWAYS mean lyrics- if you repeat a mistake, it's not a mistake.  Blue Man Group- Be different- don't take society seriously- don't have an ego whenever possible.  Steely Dan- Grooves make the world go round- Make people think about what you're saying.  Venus Hum- Laptops can be musical too.  That's all I can think of for now... I'll upd8 later.

      I was looking at flash movies, and I found someone that has the same crazy imagination as I do...   urlLink Dream Life   It has almost the same figure as i've seen! Except now it has a hat. It's a cool hat. Fits the character well.  Look for him in the video, he moves like the exact same way as I imagined, but now he's in a green pasture... although the light seems not to affect him.  Thistler is one of the great flash artists- he realized that flash movies are not only stupid stick figure movies and useless violence, but an actual art form. Now, if I could draw, i'd be on the same level. When I made GSET(greatest story ever told) in Flash, I used a stick figure because it was mostly an experiment to see what I could do in flash. Also, I can't draw. :(  Anyway, it rained today on the bus drive home, carolyn pointed and laughed at me from the bus when i got off...  When the bus takes me to it's first stop, i actually pass BY my house, and no matter how many times i ask her when we have to stop right next to it, she says no. So, I have to turn around and head back, which SUCKS because I was soaked by the time I got back to my house. I hope my laptop's okay.  That reminds me... I need to get Mr. Reyes to give me back my flash stuff from last year... hmm...

      Dumbass Sub: Okay, the only instructions for you are to review what you've learned in here. Me: Okay, Jeff, let's review. Jeff: Okay. Me: What class are you in right now? Jeff: Uhh... Me: ... Jeff: Chemistry? Me: Right! We're done!  I haven't learned a damn thing in chemistry so far this year- i knew all of it so far.

      The figure visited me again...  This time in my dream I was trying to shut my computer down, but I'd turn it off, and it'd flip right back on. I'd turn it off, each time trying something different, until i decided to unplug it. Right when I unplugged it from the socket, the monitor flashed... but not white, it flashed something like a darker black... then the figure appeared... I was shocked more than scared.  Suddenly, I was on the sidewalk of a dark city street... none of the lights were on, and there were no cars about...  It's raining, but I'm not getting wet, nor do I hear the rain hitting the pavement, or any kind of wind or thunder.  I didn't have to wait very long before he showed up. He was on the other side of the street from me... The rain was bouncing off him, but he wasn't getting wet.   We just stood there for the longest time... Then, out of nowhere, a huge flash of light came from the sky, I ducked to cover, but I looked up at where the figure was, and he was gone. And, as I opened my eyes, my mom was standing sideways telling me to get up, And I got up so she wasn't standing on the wall anymore, and almost forgot the whole thing.   As I write this in school, I'm surprised that I remembered all of this. This was the most vivid dream I've had in a long time.

      There has been a dark figure haunting my dreams for the past several nights... a dark figure, staying in the shadows... moving quickly... not close enough for you to see him... although I'm not quite sure that he is evil. Sometimes I can see his face... he's smiling... not friendly, but not... well... agh, it's hard to explain...  Of course, now that I've written about him, he won't come back. It's the same with all my dreams- if i hope to dream of something, or i recognize a dream, it goes away.  I can't stop thinking about it, though... maybe there WAS a point to Freud's theory.

      Agh, my parents are fighting. This is the biggest one they've had in a while, and my mom is going ballistic. I'm tempted to go out there and straighten things up, but I'm really just too tired... I'd either stutter too much to get the words out, or run out of stuff to say and then not make a good point, or something.

      I'm kind of in a surrealistic mood right now.  I heard these girl's conversations on the bus ride home, and their 'version' of the english language was so twisted and out of proportion, and their voices were so whiny, I kept thinking to myself... "They can't REALLY be like that, can they? They can't keep that all the time!"  The word Persona came to mind, but it stuck in my head because I didn't know the actual definition of the word. I'm still confused why it popped up.  For when I change my profile, here is what it says:   per·so·na [ p?r s?n? ] (plural per·so·nas, per·so·nae [ p?r s?nee ])    noun     3. psychology personal facade: the image of character and personality that somebody wants to show the outside world.     Sound familiar? We all have one- that really cool walk, the way you talk to certain people... I can think of two examples off the top of my head... one where they are really shy, but then they get on AIM at home and act sad all the time, and are angry at everything, and another where they are the nicest people, but then they get home and put depressing lyrics... it's a charade. They come to school with "The Distillers" shirts on, and it almost seems like they expect to be treated like a loser teenager, and then they get home and act all sad like all this stuff has been brought upon them by anybody but themselves.  I know, rebellion, hipocrisy, etc. etc. Cut the crap. Be yourself.

      friend: i don't believe jesus christ is a) of virgin birth, b) was resurrected or c) the son of god, but i do believe that he existed in one way or another, and he was a great spiritual leader friend: he taught so much to people that we have forgotten today friend: soo friend: that's what i have to say friend: comments? ShuChoMouff: no, christians haven't forgotten it, they have just pulled and twisted it out of proportion, to where it's unrecognizable from what jesus actually said.

      Fuuuuuck... guess what it is tomata? That's right, 9/11.  I don't wanna watch TV tomorrow, or read the news, or hear anybody talk about it, because it's all useless crap to me.  I know there is going to be a 3 hour long memorial on every single local news program, and comedy central'll try and make some memorial with the hosts of the Man Show, and Yahoo's whole news story will be plastered with Bush commemorating 9/11 in iraq, and noone seems to understand 3 little words.  I DON'T CARE!!!  I know, i know, it killed people, we hate brown people now, whoopidy shit, it happened 2 YEARS ago, it's time to move on.  We have more important things to be doing than saying the pledges- North Korea has been threatening america for a while, I say we give them the attention they want and blow half of their damn country off the map.  "Oh no! There are innocent peoples in there!"  pfft- they could find their own way out if they REALLY wanted to... look at the mexicans swimming their way into america! Don't tell me they'll get killed.

      Dammit, and I has to go to school tomorrow, too. I'm so tired. I just need some time to calm down, to figure what the problem is, and fix it... no such luck... I can't scrounge up 50 bucks for the blue man concert unless I work my ass off for 3 days, and I'm just not up to it. I'm tired, but I don't know why. Maybe it's the weather...

      I've been playing our drums out in the back room latley, and the dulcimer in the living room... I'd say I was good, but I wish there was a place to do it alone. I don't want to have anybody else listen... not yet, anyway.. .not till i perfect it... That's why I'm glad when I get the house to myself. I'd say I was okay at the dulcimer, and good with the drums, but it feels awkward when my parents come in and say how good i did, they were hearing my little jam session. I need a drumset... and to burn down my next door neighbor's house and build a room for myself... where I can just go and not be disturbed... Sometimes I need some time alone...

      I had another strange e-mail today, I know it was from the same person that sent me the one under the guise of me, because it was the same style of writing.  Here is the message:  "This is a nice game This game is my first work. You're the first player. I wish you would like it."  This time, it was from someone named "Ibty" at "Ibty@irr.o."  I did a search on Irr.o, and it doesn't exist. I sent a reply e-mail, it came back  as non-existant. This is starting to creep me out.  I'm the first player? What game is this?

      Well, Malvinas was fun, but again, nobody showed. At least I told people this time.  Wasn't that exciting, anyway.  I'm always confused why it doesnt sink in that these people are famous that show up- sometimes SUPER famous. I haven't ever seen em before, so I was just talking to him casually, although he seemed surprised I wasn't bowing before him.  Even last time, the band last month was HUGE in the U.K., but it didn't sink in, it was just kinda "Hey, how's it goin?" I think the band last month was better, personally. They made an instrument out of a turkey baster! I wouldn't have thought of that.

      We got laptops today!!! WHEEEE!!! School can finally begin!  It's too bad that the school is an ass-hat, and put so many restrictions on our computer that we can't do anything. Well, almost anything. Within 1 day, a friend of mine got AIM on his computer, when everyone said it couldn't be done.  I just need a CD player. Really, REALLY badly. In half my classes we can use them.  Well, I'm off to play Savage. Great game name, right? Don't worry, COA people, I'm not a hopeless freak like AJ is when it comes to gaming. Just messin with ya, AJ :-D

      I got a very strange e-mail today.  It's subject was "A new website" and it's message read:  "This is a very new website I wish you would enjoy it."  The wierdest thing is who I got it from. It was me.  Yes, I got an E-mail from, apparentally, my e-mail address, journeymantsa2000@yahoo.com.  The insane part that really confused me, it had the original spelling.  For those of you who knew me back when i had my old journeyman screenname, you'd know that it was JourneymanTSA.  And, my old e-mail was JourneymanTSA@hotmail.com  But, when I switched to yahoo, it made everything lowercase automatically and put a 2000 in front of it.  The e-mail address i got this message from was "JourneymanTSA2000@yahoo.com"  And I had thought everyone had forgotten the original spelling.  This is also freaky because it's happened once before, but I can't remember what it said.  Now, either I'm sleep-typing, or someone's playing games with me.

      It's a time of overall suckage for a couple of my friends latley. I'm kind of in a "what's the point?" stage where i don't know what I'm doing, or why I'm doing it...  Why do i WANT to go home immediatelly after school?  Why do I sit at my computer every day, waiting for people to get on AIM that are worth talking to?(all... like... 6 of you)  My most fun during the week latley has been church on sunday, and that's usually cut too short by the fact that it's only an hour and a half long.  I sit here, listening to my music, writing in this journal that probably nobody reads anymore, when I could be doing something much more productive, if only I knew what it was.  Don't get me wrong, I love it when people read my webjournal, it makes me feel like I've accomplished something... But i doubt anyone does.  Oh sure, I may seem happy around people, but that's because I AM happy around people. It's when I'm alone when i start losing it.  Ergh, I don't wanna type anymore. I'm so tired, but I don't wanna sleep.  I need human interaction.

      Ugh... I feel sick... I'm way too full.  My family is being a huge jerk-ass again. They wanted to have a "fancy meal" today, but they seem to think that being fancy also means being an asshole. My brother has been a jerk since he turned 13 two days ago. My parents are acting the way they do when they're stressed out. They get pissed off at you for not having a "fancy" glass, but when you point out that the style of your glass is completely trivial, they act like they didn't do anything wrong.  I tried to sit through the new Lord Of The Rings DVD we bought, but it's 3 hours too long.  I just kept thinking about how irritated i would get when a LOTR fan would start an arguement that Ints aren't trees. "They look like trees!" i would say. They reply "But they talk!"  "Yeah, but they said it in the movie, they were trees with something in them that made them grow tall and be able to talk and move."  "But... but... they're not trees. They're Ints."  And, depending on whether it's a guy or girl i'm talking to, this line is added.  "Shut up."  I'm serious, that arguement has happened a total of 3 times. It's almost as bad as when a Trekkie asks you whether you think a Klingon Bird of Prey would win against a Sovreign class Federation ship with 3 phaser banks and 5 photon torpedo bays. To that, I break their glasses.  I enjoy Star Trek, Especially TNG and Voyager, but I have a serious question to all the people who actively ponder whether Kirk or Sisko would get his ass handed to him in a fistfight:  "Have you ever created/done anything PRODUCTIVE because of your addiction to Star Trek?"  Debates don't count.  I'd say about 90% of the time if I asked that question, i'd either get a "No," a semi-witty remark followed by a disgusting laugh, or they would go off on another topic.  The other 10 percent are the people working right now that have actually come up with a plausible theory in which a Transporter may be possible. The people who are working to end starvation, and unite the world. The people who left for the army and left the rest of us the hell alone!  Still, though, not to be a hypocrite, I could discuss the philosophies of the Blue Man all day. I could act like one, I've memorized "Paint Drumming" and could actually do it if i could get 2 snare drums and some paint. I'm working on being able to catch marshmallows and junk in my mouth.  I'm not sure what the point of this is, but it sure was more interesting than those crap stories at the play on saturday! I'll think of the point I was trying to make after i get my head together, I got distracted that 2 of the notes in my PVC can be used in the PVC IV song. :-D

      Okay, time for me to update more about the lockin.  We played a game called Signs, here's the basic jist of it for those who don't know:  Everybody gets in a big circle who wants to play. I'll give you a marker for those of you who know.   START   Each person creates a physical sign, like waving their hands in the air or a peace sign(mine was headbanging to the right)  Someone is chosen to be put in the middle of the circle, and someone is chosen to give the first command.  The middle person looks at the "commander," and the commander does their symbol, then the symbol of someone else, making them the "commander" and the middle person has to tag the new commander before they can do their sign, then another one, etc.   END  We played that, it was fun.  The only reason i wrote this post was because I was trying to sleep, and a friend of mine's alarm went off(i had put it on her when i needed to talk to her about someone, i guess i accidentally saved it), and i decided to go ahead and write something before i attempted to crash again.  I'm wondering what i should do with the rest of these marshmallows before they go stale.  It's 7:40 in the morning, i guess i can get breakfast... or... something.  I've been working on a list of random thoughts, i'll post em up here as soon as i think it's long enough.

      Well, i think it's safe to say that the lockin TOTALLY kicked ass!  Except for that play.  What an awful excuse for a worthless pile of shit that play was.  But otherwise it was fun as hell.  AJ and I got bored at like 4:00, so i took this container of cheese-balls i had and said "Hey, throw these at me" and i kept catching em in my mouth, it kept us entertained until sunrise.  I suck ass at throwing stuff.  Church people, Ya know those those tables in the church? the new gray circular ones? We found that some of them make a cool noise when you hit em with mallets.  I'm trying to get tired, i stayed up 34 hours then went to bed at noon and slept till 10... i wanna go back to bed as to not mess up my schedule TOO much...  I'll post back with more about the lock-in later.

      Huge blast of noise, then silence.. calmly quiet, only the far away sound of cars passing... perhaps, like in an out-of-the-way suburb. No light... no desire to go anywhere...  Not a white light, but a dark blue, almost black. Seems like most other people wouldnt be able to see it.  Forced to look up at the ceiling because it is impossible to sleep... thinking... unconsciousness.

      I finally gots Max Payne 2, yay!  Explosions and shizzle.  There was a stack of moveable chairs, and i blew em up with a grenade, but i didnt know that there were explosives under the chairs, so the whole room blew up. Good times.  Oh, and before I go, if you actually care that the cowboys lost the game, please go jump off a cliff. I don't want your blubbering shit talking to me about how we lost. I don't care. I know it's hard for some of you to accept, but... i really don't give a flying taco.  By the way, i've decided that Taco is the best word ever.

      You know what pisses me off?  "No, jesse, we have no idea."  Shut up, and stop being sarchastic. Just kidding. But...  Ya know when people (mostly unitarians?) have something sort-of-lucky happen to them, and they say "Oh! There is a god!"  Oh, there's a god simply because you have a dollar in your purse to buy cookies, eh? Fuck you! I don't respect your opinion anymore!  So n3ways, my dad got Halo for PC, and he was all like "Yous cant play it, because ifs we bof play on the internet, they'll catch us!" and I'm all "You don't play on the internet you toof decayed walrus!" and he's like "Oh yeah" and gave me the CD.  I didnt' actually call him a toof decayed walrus. And we don't really talk like that. But it's shizzle to be in the bling bling nizzle. I think. So, now I officially have Halo PC. I want Max Payne 2.  Worms are good at driving rocketships. Good at eating bags of potato chips, make good dreamers... like for littleredvegebatleshortening, and creamer, for coffee, and for dreams... i'm a worm.

      Well, my whole family, over the course of the week, got the sickness I got at group dynamix. My dad has it the worst.  My dad and I are staying home while my brother and mom are at a family reunion... I said i didn't want to go because my legs hurt(which they do), but its more because I feel uncomfortable around my family... what with them all being devout christian and such.  I keep feeling proud of meself every morning when I refuse to do the pledges at school... before i was pretending like i was doing it, but ive just decided to say "fuck em" and just stand up. I'll stand, because I know i'll be sitting for another hour and a half, but i dont say shit. And I take it upon myself to have a "coughing attack" during the Minute of Silence.  I just learned that computer games are being used to treat phobias. They used Max Payne to create tight spaces, heights, and spider-filled areas for people with claustrophobia, fear of heights, and arachnophobia, and tested them out- they worked. Cool.

      I haven't updated with anything journal-like in a while.  The weekend was fun, but i totally didn't get to enjoy having a long one, because I got sick on sunday morning and I'm still sick. Food poisoning?  Group dynamix was uber fun, but I only wish I had more stamina than i do X-P  Ugh, throwing up is NOT fun. Neither is PE, which I have tomorrow. I'm still sore from group dynamix(i had about as much workout at group dynamix as i have had in PE the entire year)  I'm supposed to be doing this shit history homework, but i'm not. It's vocabulary, and I don't know what I'm gonna do, because my laptop doesnt like the internet at home, and my home computer is not liking search engines for some reason right now. Prolly has to do with that Qhosts virus. I'll figure it out sooner or later.  About viruses- if you ever see someone's profile with WWW.REALPHX.COM in reeeal big and bold letters, tell them to talk to me, and DON'T CLICK THE LINK!  It is the stoopidest virus thing ever. IM me if you want me to tell you how it works.  I spent upwards of 3 hours working on a virus i didnt have, because it was so simple... stoopid.  It was monday night, at like 9, and i thought "Oh crap, i have english homework!" so I spent two hours making a flash amination of a stick figure who feeds his baby laxatives accidentally instead of milk. I love cartoons.  :-O i dont think i did my math homework! Oh, yes i did.    Hmm... what else... hmm...  I missed jay and alex's lan. Sorry, I was sick out of my mind that day, I couldn't even stand up until like 8 PM.

      Jesus Christ, i'm sick of this. Everybody, right now, stop what you're doing, and put your hand in your mouth. I know it sounds wierd, but keep up.  Feel your teeth. Particularly the ones at the front of your mouth. They're sharp, aren't they?  Guess what those are for. Take a good, LONG guess.  Give up? The answer is MEAT. You PETA-nazis seem to forget that we are SUPPOSED to be eating meat, because that is how the world spins. Don't get me wrong, we are supposed to eat vegetables too, but it doesn't work with just one. Every single vegan i know is reeeeeeeeeeally skinny and unhealthy-looking, and i imagine it's kinda along the lines of eating too much sweets, and not enough vegetables. I guess it's half-opposite.  That's ****ing it, i'm starting the "for every animal you don't eat, i'm eating two" program. Anyone want me to sponsor them?  P.S. only when cows become endangered will I say "ooh... maybe we should slow down..."   -one of my posts on the Blue Man Forum, on a thread talking about the PETA ad campaign that compared slaughtering cattle to nazi concentration camps.  I usually keep this and the forum separate, but i thought that the above was good, and that it'd turn a few heads X-P

       urlLink MegaGames - H-L 2 Thief Speaks pc   God FUCKING dammit!! THIS is why i'm pissed at game thieves, dan!  You fucking little shits steal games before they're released, and put them on the internet ILLEGALLY, and now HL2 could be delayed INDEFINITLEY!!!  WHY?!??! why start it in the first place?  I don't see the fucking thief's reasoning.  "To everyone saying this is no Beta: I'd like to point out that THIS is what you wanted Valve to release on 9/30/03, theres no such thing as a much better release in Valves network!  I suggested to Valve to stop lying to their customers about how much was stolen. However, they disregarded my statement and called me a liar. Now they will see how much I have been lying when I release the Pre-Gold and all 100 per cent of the sourcecode. Actions speak louder then words. "  Okay, so he's stolen HL2, and just because Valve calls him a liar(which they have good reason that he is), he thinks valve has done the wrong thing and threatens to destroy HL2 for good?  Already, a third of the sourcecode has been stolen, and HalfLife2 will prolly be delayed until April 2004, to rewrite what was stolen.  But now, it might be fucking YEARS, i wouldn't be surprised if Gabe Newell went around the offices tomorrow and smashed EVERY FUCKING COMPUTER out of existence because of the thief.  If i ever meet that guy, you can guarantee I'm gonna beat his ass. Even if he's a fake. Just for him to see what he's caused. Sometimes violence is the answer. It's all these idiots understand.

      I'm sick of this. I know like 17 kathys now. I am confused.  I have come up with an idea. An idea that will change the world, and rid me of all confusion.  I will build a machine. A big machine. And I will take all the kathys in the world, and put them in the machine, and the machine will make machiney noises, and all the kathys in the world will have changed into one, uber-kathy, with the strength of 600 kathys!  There. I've said it.

      Mr. Witter gave a great lecture today. I seriously wanted to remember what he said, but for some reason it got lost. The ending was powerful though. "I'm done with you for today." Just, the way he said it, and the context it was in... wow.  Prolly because the lecture was at fucking  8 in the morning, i had barely enough time to wake up, much less able to remember a fucking lecture. I hate the school system. I can't learn shit at 7:35 in the morning.

      Jesus Christ.   urlLink Donnie Darko.   That scared the crap out of me.  But it's an IFC movie? Shit, that network has the worst movies in the history of anything, ever. I've sat through 3 movies on that network, and 5 previews, all crap.  This one seems different though. That rabbit scared the crap out of me.

      Ooh, so websense was down for a couple days, eh?  ShuChoMouff: you know the reason the sites were blocked? RabidBunni: not really ShuChoMouff: somebody slipped websense a virus ShuChoMouff: and it freaked out and blocked everything RabidBunni: thats what we were hypothosizing today during history ShuChoMouff: cause the techs are bitches, and they're sitting on their high horses in the tech room saying "Oh, we're so good, websense is the best program ever" and some guy(who i  now i have respect for, although i dont know who he/she is) said "well since you're a bunch of assholes, i slipped you a virus. There, happy, bitches?" RabidBunni: lol RabidBunni: nice  It only half surprised me that the mac students didnt know what the hell was going on/didnt have anything to do with it. I mean, half of them are too stupid to have an opinion of their own, much less write a simple virus that changes DNS signals.  Anyway, enough of that.  God, this is pissing me off. That movie Kill Bill. It's pissing me off. I hate uma thurman, she doesnt deserve to be an action  hero, she looks so washed up in all the previews, and that stoopid yellow jumpsuit looks so stoopid, its STOOPID!!!  I also h8 lucy liu. She always looks cross-eyed, i hate her! she has never had more than like 5 lines in a movie until now, but shes saying stoopid things like "silly rabbit" and "you thought it'd be easy?" "Now let's hear uma thurman bitch about some loser named bill who put her in a kung fu dojo with a really lame yellow spandex jumpsuit and  make her fight some stoopid schoolgirl with a ballandchain."  Then some random cowboy is sitting at a bar sayin "Damn, she deserves that revenge."  For what? God dammit, everyone has tried, but noone can explain this movie to me in a way that doesnt make it stoopid as hell.  You know what other movie is pissing me off? Intolerable cruelty. God, I h8 catherine zeta jones, shes such a bitch, just cause she was in zorro she just turned into some kind of super-bitch.  "oh look @ me, I'm catherine Zeta jones because im a bigot that needs 3 names to feel better about myself, and I'm being a bitch in this movie with cloony, where for some reason he likes me, some bitchy bitch, and cloony tried to get his cloony on, but nooo i had to be all like 'is that all, whore?' and he's all 'you fascin8 me!' but all the while he's got his hand in a dog's mouff and im just standing there looking all bitchy" and i h8 this movie!!!!!!!!!  Yeah, other than that, my legs hurt, and i have a headache. Not to bitch. :-O  Group Dynamix lockin this saturday! WHEEEEE!!! Good, christian, team-building fun!  in that e-mail i sent out, if i were just sending it to us non-adults, instead of "pushin things" i would have said "Kicking ass."  :-O mia, imuh kill laura(or was it linda) for ya when we get there... heheheheh  We should have like a joint-church lockin @ horizon if all goes well.  I'm hoping to get there and see one of my christian-friends and find out he/she is a unitarian, then i can go ":-O!1!! HAHAHAHH!!!" and dance around as i fling dancing monkeys into the crowd.  I don't think they allow monkeys at the lockin, though. Might have to negotiate some koala bears in.  I like that word. Bear. If you say it right, it's funny. kinda like burrrrr, but with a bit of an E in there. beurrrrrhh. No. You'll have to ask me later.  Also! AAHNULD is GUVNUH!!!! !11!! !!1!11!!! !!!111!11! !111111!11 11!!!!1!1  everybody's all pissed off, but i'm just sitting in the back of the political debate room laughing my ass off. I had to listen to this interview on NPR on the way home from school and some kid in china that doesnt know what he's doing ACTUALLY said(translated from chinese):  "Arnold Schwartzenegger is a strong man with very large muscles. I think this is the reason he was elected, because he looks like a man who is strong enough to run a country."     :-O no Terminator 4, baby! I thought i'd never see the day i'd post a picture of arnold schwartzenegger's bikini wax, but i did it to prove a point.  That point is:  Wait... is that a pomegranate? Sorry, I'll have to finish this post later.

      Wow- School of Rock was AWESOME!!! I hated the parents though. Those snotty bastards. I wanted to eat them.  I also rented Dreamcatcher today. What a freaky movie! When that worm thing came out of that guy's ass, my dad left. Steven King is crazy. Now, what I need to do, is buy all Clive Barker books, movies, games, and other material, and read ALL of it, so i'll be as fucked up as he is. Why? I dunno. It sounds like it would reduce boredom when you can make someone throw up just by lookin at em.  :-O the Dynamix lockin is this saturday! whooo! I say Dynamix because apparentally the company thinks spelling words inkorecctly is totally kool TO THE MAX, and  by sounding hip will attract more angst-filled teens my age to buy into the team-building bullcrap. I got a game that'll keep me and AJ occupied, though. Cheeseballs!  Much like the Marshmallow skit from Blue Man Group, we just throw cheeseballs until we miss the catch, and... uhh... we'll come up with rules later.  Needta buy a big box o' cheeseballs. Like... from sams.. or something.

I'll ask around tomorrow and over the weekend, but if noone wants to, there's no point in doing it alone.  Depression phase.... now.  . .. ... .... ..... ...... ..... .... ... .. .   Boy, that stops the boredom.  Yeah, anyway, if you wanna go as a blue man for halloween with me(might goto my church party if comeone from COA goes...), I'm all for it! Girls are welcome. Guess I should call it "blue person."

      So, i wake up this morning to my parents turning on my light, and saying 'You gotta wake up!"  I'm like, "Why!??!?"  And my mom says "thanksgiving! we are going to your grandparents' house!"  I said "I thought we were having thanksgiving at our house this year!"  They said "No... we ALWAYS have thanksgiving at our grandparents house, remember?"  "Mom! We had thanksgiving at our house last year!"  'Well... umm... get up!"  Grr.  Sometimes they forget things that are impossible to forget, like they're afraid of the consequences if they do remember.  My mom keeps coming into my room and asking "is everything okay?" like she doesn't know that I would rather not spend my day sitting in a house in lindale while a bunch of older people talk about stuff i don't really care about.  I know she knows, and she knows that i know that she knows.  But, she still expects an answer from me, but if i give her the truth, she'll get pissed.  Ugh.  Have a.... thanksgiving.

      Thanksgiving tommorow. Well, thanksgiving in 2 minutes for when this was written.  Yay...? I guess?  It's too bad i don't really feel "in tune" with my family, because i'm athiest and they're all right-wing.  1 minute left.  My parents dont want me to tell them, but i do, but then again, i dont know how I would pull it off, so it can wait.  But, my parents have decided not to tell me what we're doing for thanksgiving tommorrow.  Happy thanksgiving.  If we have to wake up at 7:00 and drive 2 hours to my grandparents house, i'm gonna be pissed because i don't have any "grandparent" clothes. You know them. The kind that you wear when you see your grandparents.  Even if you dont have them, you know what they are. about 3 steps below "sunday school suits."  Suddenly, it smells like my grandparent's caddilac in here. Maybe it's the cat.  Happy minute-into-thanksgiving.

      **This was going to be one of my posts on a message board about Michael Jackson, but in an effort to not break the rules of the message boards (mainly "offending" issues), i've moved it here and given everyone the link. **   [QUOTE]Berkeline: I think.. that if we all try and go through life without "offending" anyone, then this world would be horribly, unbearably boring. That word to me, "offended," is so annoying now.. no one can stand to be "offended." They have to stay in their little box, surrounded only by the beliefs and ideas they hold true, and when someone tries to show them another side to something, they scream, "DONT OFFEND ME!" and curl up into the fetal position. Everything must be censored, trimmed, cropped, critiqued, and conformed so it will be perfectly, utterly unopinionated, and perfectly, utterly bland. -sigh- To expect everyone to be perfectly composed and not offend ANYONE, all of the time, is like expecting the world to be a perfect place; it's not going to happen.[/QUOTE]   Ooo! That was good! May I quote you?   I agree that you need to show a *little* constraint, but sometimes i feel the urge to slap people and tell them to sit down, calm down, and shut up- just for a second!    The way people always feel like they're always being offended is sickening- I've kinda gotten interested in psychology latley(not any advanced stuff... just basic principles), and i've found that Extinction works really well. Extinction is basically a more scientific term for ignoring someone. When you stop paying attention to them, they go away.  So when I get people calling me a "white boy," or anything, i'm like "Okay. Your point is?"  Because, unlike a number of white people these days, I realize that I am white and have no problem with it. So when they call me white, you can tell that's meant to be an insult, and when i show them that it means nothing to me, they stop because it's not fun anymore.  Now, don't give me all this "oh, other races get treated worse!" crap, it barely ever happens anymore. And, can you tell me how us white people are supposed to NOT be racist when almost all non-white stand-up comedians do the "white people walk like this" joke?  See? See? I've found loopholes in society, go me!

      Today, i just wanted to run up to my parents, slap them, and yell "Calm the fuck down, SIT the fuck down, and SHUT the fuck up for a second!"  Every 5 seconds, they want me to do something else, which I can't do, because I'm busy doing something else, then get pissed at me an hour later whan i can't remember what it was that i was supposed to do because i couldn't remember so many commands!  Grr...  I keep feeling like i'm waiting for something... Like something's supposed to click in my head soon and go "*POP* i'm here!"  Stoopid Alan decided that I have to spend MLK weekend with a bunch if insane UUs to celebrate my birthday by making me chug 3 gallons of sugar.  Here's to Houston.

      ShuChoMouff: hmm... you can download splinter cell (the full game) for free off fileplanet.... IF you extend your subscription for 6 months, which costs 39.95... ShuChoMouff: i was like "buh buh buh BULLSHIT!!!" granmastabizwakee: and then you were sad because noone heard you ShuChoMouff: right  Hmm...  Everybody just needs to calm the fuck down. Everybody is so tense and asshole-ish latley. I noticed that my speakers were plugged in wrong, and that I didn't do it, so I asked my parents if they did anything to them(nicely), and they get all indignant on me! They go "Well quit accusing us, we didn't do anything!"  And i keep saying "Calm down! Calm down! I'm not freakin accusing you of anything!!!!"  But they just keep bitching and bitching and bitching!  And a friend of mine fucking goes berserk on another guy a few days ago, the other guy was asking him a question or something and my friend hits him in the back of the neck with a tennis racket! I was like "Dood! What was that for?" and he said "He's fucking pissing me off!"  I didn't get why he was PMSing or something that day, but i was trying not to get pissed myself, so i just sat down.  Why don't we all just sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up???  I'm trying to listen to music, and this guy who sits next to me in Web2 (who probably knows that everyone in the world fucking hates him, but he tries anyway) keeps trying to show me his mediocre flash movies, and i just keep ignoring him, because we both know that i don't give a flying fuck about his cartoonage, but he still shows me. I know that everybody knows that i'm good at flash, good for you guys, but that doesn't mean i get to be bothered by people i don't know/don't like.   Don't get me wrong, i like my friends, they're cool, but people on average are selfish assholes who need to be beaten. This has led to my catch phrase, shouting "WHO ARE YOU?!?!?!" (i know that was stolen from mall monkeys, but Keith isn't here, is he?) at people.  Like, this guy, Rico i think, we're sitting at our lunch table one day talking about something(probably Binh playing DDR and Alex stealing Dan's racket while David eating food and me bitching about whatever), and this guy comes up (NONE of us know him) and just sits down and asking us what's up and how our day was! I was like "WHO ARE YOU?!?!?" with my arms all in the air and stuff, and he's like "Rico. What's up homes?"  I just give him this look like "what the hell are you doing here? Leave. Now." and he just sits there like a fucking loon with his thumb up his ass, then goes to leave to walk around with this wigger and some other dude.  Whatever. Just, whatever.  I'm gonna go... downstairs... or something.

      My Legs are all sore and such... from running in PE(even though we only did half a mile), and jumping from the concert REALLY took my legs out. But... it was fun, and the pain is temporary. Yay.  I think i did a good explanation of this one scene in the concert... although I don't remember where I did it... church or school... I was talking about how, after the Complex song, the 3 blue men come out with blue welders masks, and they take em off and "repair the damage," and it seemed a good way to explain it in real life. I dunno.  I'm gonna goto bed now. I have another useless day of benchmarking and web mastering to look forward to.  BlueBlueborrito IMed me and made me remember that I still want to make a signature for the Blue Man Message Boards. I guess I'll brainstorm possibilities in the morning/at school.

      Oh my god, Blue Man was the coolest concert EVER!!!  I didn't post because I was sick of writing for a while, i spent 2 and a half hours last night writing a tour journal and posting it(and some pics) on the web.   urlLink My Storage Bin Site(for now, a place to store my Complex pics and the Tour Journal)   The tour journal is long as hell, as it encompasses my whole day of getting ready for the concert, during the concert(spoilers by the pant load), and after the concert.  For a lot of you, you won't ending up seeing the tour, but not to worry- i'm preordering the DVD today which is the whole concert live, filmed at NextStage in Grand Prarie on August 12th and 13th. Wheeeee!!  Hmm... so what's happened this week...  It turns out that this is TEKS(it was TAKS, and before that TAAS) Benchmark testing week... but the only class to do it so far is English. And it SUCKS!!! And boy, does it suck hard!  Dan and Binh got to miss school 3day to go play tennis, which is good for them because today was boring as hell.  History= reading Comp Sci= boring programs Maff= Inverse Matrices.  All easy junk. I could have skipped and not had any detriment to my education today.  Of course, it doesn't matter.  Meh.  Double Meh.  I just realized that I have nothing to look forward to anymore.

      :-O Blue man concert TODAY ph0ur t3h w00t3h@!!!11!  Also, Adam got me into planetside. I only played for one day, but i never went "Woah! that's awesome!" Still, I was impressed with the stratics and team-work of my squad. I'm also glad noone questioned Adam's orders, he's a good "commander," it worked well. I need to get teamspeak. I think i'll play more.  I'll post my "review" on the complex concert tomorrow, or whenever i get it done.  Wow, i forgot how good Train was.

      You know what feeling you get when you know someone who you are just now starting to think may be smart, but then they open their goddamn mouths and you find out that they're just a good-for-nothing retard?  I hate that.  I was watching Taken, and one of the characters said something that kinda stuck with me. The quote in green is what stuck. The quotes in red are the guy talking to the person who said that, a 9-year old girl who's like a 6th alien.    "Ally, i mean... every day i get up and i don't see anything until the end of the day. It doesn't ever seem to matter until the end!"   "When you play a song, do you play the whole thing thinking only about the ending?"    "No, i'm..."   "..."   "Ohhhhh!!"   If you haven't seen Taken, you should. I'm gonna try to buy the DVD pack.  I had to goto the Dermitologist 3day and he told me i have a "disease" on my arm called karrotus chuchgsljfseofj i dont care what the hell it's called.  He also said that 7 out of 10 people have it, worldwide.  Doesn't that make it NOT a disease when 70 FUCKING percent of the world has it???  They also said it doesn't hurt, or look bad(its usually in the way-back of your arm where your sleeves are), or turn into anything serious. You know what that means? That means it's not a disease. Diseases are ailments, and something you want to get rid of quickly. I've had this shit all my life apparentally, and it's never bothered me until my mom said ":-O we has to get you to a dermitologist!" Then, all the sudden for some reason, its the most horrible thing in the world that i want to almost cut off myself with a knife.  Not really. It's just as stoopid as it was before.  I can see that some (*cough shallow*) people would think of it as a disease, because it doesn't look completely perfect.  If you haven't noticed, i'm not the master of perfection. I know i'm not a looker, and i don't need any dermitologist medicne to cover it up.  Whatever. If my parents want to spend an ass-load of money on some asshole that made a life choice to look at skin diseases all his life, whatever.

      Here's what I posted on a forum about whether Pokemon was better than Yu-Gi-Oh.  "Okay, anybody who votes on this thread deserves to be chopped into little pieces(feet first... dont want them dying right away) and fed to starving ethiopians."  Well, people started bitching at me that pokemon teaches us morals and stuff, i replied with this:   "Jesus christ, get over yourselves and get your thumb out of your ass. Pokemon teaches us NOTHING. The only morals it gives you are directly related to pokemon, they have no use in the outside world. Here's what pokemon has taught me:  "Always let your yellow thingy run around while you keep all the other thingies kept up in little balls that impossibly shrink"  "Never let some 17 year old girls(i know one was a guy, shut the fuck up) try to take my yellow thingy and all my other thingies."  Same with all anime- it's retarted, it teaches nothing, it's not funny, it doesn't look cool, it's completely useless.  I could take a dump on a piece of paper right now and it would have more artistic value than anything anime ever would.  I say we bomb japan again(or just their artists) just so their damn media will get out of our country and will stop influencing people to become complete retards, and influencing artists' styles(note: the guy who drew Dexter's Lab's style has gotten exponentially shittier(i.e. anime-d) each cartoon since Samurai Jack- he even went back and shittified Dexter. For shame.)  For all you lamers who like anime, look in the mirror, and then slap yourself until you're not stupid anymore. For some of you, this may kill you. Good."   Let's see what they reply with.

      Well, today i realized that i was about as bored as i was sick... so i guess that means i'm healing up.  And just my luck, i get sick right when it starts to get cold. So, it's 50 degrees outside and i'm having chills. Great.  I'm just glad my family finally decided to acknowledge the fact that i don't like carbonated stuff and bought me apple juice. Hooray for them.

Here ya go:  -Having a smoking section in a restaurant is like having a peeing section in a swimming pool.  -Jesus Christ, the Red Hot Chili Peppers aren't THAT good.  -Next person who says "Lawlz" to me, around me, or directed somewhere where I can see/hear it is getting punched in the throat.  -The next skinny girl that says she's fat is getting punched in the throat.  -Referring to hundred dollar bills- it's amazing how a little piece of paper can solve so many problems.  -Cap'n crunch looks like napoleon.  -   -"Send to 15 peeps or more..." -whoops, sorry, i don't have any "peeps." i have friends, but I guess that disqualifies me, eh?  -Horses aren't THAT important and beautiful, are they? Sure, they're cool, but...  -I hate sprites. I hate them i hate them i HATE THEM!!! They look so crappy, do these people think they're some kind of art form? They look like SHIT!!!  It's not as long as the last one, but i wanted to get these out before something bad happens to my text file X-P

      Maddox has yet again renewed his godliness in a response to hatemail regarding the Caps Lock Key, here's an excerpt:  Seven sixteenths of one inch:      That's the distance you'd have to move your pinky in order to not sound like an idiot. I know the burden of pressing shift to capitalize is a great one, but c'mon Turing, you can do better than that. I used to type emails in caps like yours, but then I decided that I didn't want a job mixing concrete.

      I'm sick with the flu... I'll be out of school the rest of the week... sorry guys...  I was having one of those sick dreams... tossing and turning and junk last night... you know how the guy who created the Terminator thought up the whole idea for his movie from a  flu dream, of the robot emerging from the flames? I had a dream that kinda reminded me of a long movie, but it made no sense at all.  It started out, me and some people(they were all faceless... kinda just... people) were getting a tour of some kind of horse race thing... we walked outside to look at the tracks, and the tour guide left us alone for a while to look around, then all of the sudden a bull smashed through(albeit slowly) the wall separating us from the horse tracks. The bull wasn't doing anything, but the people were freaking out, so I(but remember, i still think this is a movie) go back to the tour guide, and she doesn't seem too concerned.  At this point in my mind i say "Man, this movie goes on FOREVER!!"   Then we go back to look at the bull, and instead of a bull, we find a Hunter, from the game Halo. I shoot him, then the group and I(although the group are now marines) run down the track, dodging exploding walls and battling the flood(mutated monsters for you non-Halo fans).  then, all the sudden, the scene changes to Danny Tamborelli(younger Pete from Pete & Pete) driving up to this checkpoint- the guard steps out and goes "Boogah boogah boogah!" and then all the sudden Danny is running down the road, being chased by the guard, but also chasing him are a pair of pants, spinning on a pole.  He loses the guard and comes up on another, larger post station. There was another guard there and he says "what are you doing with those spinning pants!" and Danny says "Smith!"(i think he was referring to the guard chasing him). The guard says "Smith? What? He's right here, I found him behind his guard post eating dandelions!" and pulls out a fat man in a highway patrol suit with yellow petals sticking out of his mouth.  Danny then says "But... if it wasn't you, then..."  Then both the guards say "Boogah boogah boogah!!!" and he screams, and the scene changes again.  First it's dark, then, as if night goggles are turned on, you see the inside of a small room, with a couch, and a rug under it. I for some reason know that the rug is really dirty. Then all the sudden the vacuum cleaner starts working on it's own, cleaning the rug... but it doesn't do anything, the dust just comes back. For some reason, in the movie, this is funny, because it had a delightful tone to it for some reason.  Then, the scene changes again, and now a young Jack Black is eating cereal. He's just eating and eating. Then, he drops his spoon and a whole mess of milk splashes him in the face. He starts laughing and splashing some more. Then it showed the scene where danny was running from the spinnning pants on a pole again. Then I woke up.  I'm surprised at 2 things.  1. It was so long 2. I remembered it. 3.   Wait... that's 3 things.  1. It was so long 2. I remembered it. 3. My mind came up with this stuff.  Hmm... I'm about to fall over now because of my fluishness, so i'm gonna take a nap. See ya.

      Yay. They left for the party and I didn't(referring to my last post)  My dad's all dissapointed in me now because i didn't wanna bullshit my way through a few hours at their house. I'm sick and tired of them, because they made me spend the night there once. Unacceptable.  Their dad is a blubbering drunk(who acts the same when hes drunk as when he's sober), the mom tries to act nice all the time, but she's pulling her hair out, and looks like the most stressed person in the world. The older brother pisses me off because he seems to refuse to not slur his words- he also has some kind of thing in his head that makes him think i'm friends with him. The older brother is the one that got me into all this, who became friends with my brother, and in turn my family met them, so blah.

      Well, halloween sucked.  It's not that anything bad happened, it's just that i didn't get to do anything. It was just like a normal night, just with people wanting my candy.  Great. Just Great. My family decided to become best friends with the most annoying family in the history of the world. My family know i hate them, but they really want me to go to this dinner party the annoying family is having anyway. They'd have to cut my allowance to make me go.

Bump-mapped EVERYTHING.  2. My english teacher. Holy shit, she just needs to admit that she's a total bitch so we won't hate her as much. She spent all last period calling Binh a moron, and then trying to say "I don't really mean that!" when all she was doing was covering up. I was like "How the fuck do you get off, you stupid bitch?!?!"  She didn't hear that, but i said it. Really!  3. Comedy Improv thingy. Yes, I went to a comedy improv show, like Whose line is it anyway, except there are 8 people and the points ACTUALLY MATTERED. Really? Yes.  The first 2 or so sketches were gag inducing shit-your-pants funny, but by the end it was merely hillarious. :-O  I was gonna type more, but then I went downstairs and forgot what I was saying. Oh well.

I guess i'd better live up to the standards i've created for myself... here is a post I wrote for my friend on some forums we use at school(he had said he had gotten to "20 battle rank" or whatever in the game Planetside, and he's also a forumwhore, and I was feeling stoopid, so I just started typing :-O):  They should give forum whores like you with rank 20 sooperman powers. You e-mail sony now and say "I's a forumwhore bitch! its official!" and they're like ":-O sorry master lawls!" and you're like "X-D" and they're like "Now let's eat cake and be merry" and you're like "X-P yes mahm" and theyre like "im not a mamn you son of a cake horn!" and you're like "sony you assblock" and theyre like "go fuck a cheesegrater" and theyre like "hey, that's jesses cool line because he kicks ass" and they're all "well go eat a poison taco" and you're like "but tacos are teh shiz" and they're like "well ill beat you at a eating contest" and you're like ":-O" and they're like "thats right bizzle, we eats a lots" and you cap all of them because you're a leet rank 20 forumwhore. :-O

If we all ate a homeless person (bum), NO MORE HOMELESS PROBLEM!!!   So everyone do youre part. Support LCNF (Legalize Canibalism Now Foundation) and fight the good fight!!!  P.S.

      I had a dream the other night... I was at the blue man concert, but everything was all dark, I couldn't see the audience or anything. I walk up to the stage for some reason, and I notice that everyone onstage is looking at me. Peter Moore drags me up on stage, but he's all acting like a blue man, so it's odd. I get the feeling he lost his voice or something. He points to a microphone, and the band starts playing The Current.  I don't know exactly what that means/if it means anything, but i'm starting to think that my mind feels guilty for leaving choir/a couple good friends behind. But, then I realize that I left choir because it's been a shit to me ever since I joined it, and I'm better off without it.  So this post wasn't funny, or stabbed at society. Suck it up and get over it.

      I'm gonna fucking fail this god damn history presentation tomorrow. And i'm unfortunately gonna take the whole god damn team down with me. One of them deserves it for being a bitch, but syed helped. the ONLY thing i asked her to do was come up with examples of what a good thesis would be, but she just acted frustrated, flirted with charley(who happens to be gay), and talked on AIM. Fucking bitch. Noone is helping me in the other groups either. I dunno what the hell I'm gonna do. I've found out my plan for the weekend:  Friday: Goto school, give charles his god damn dollar(lmao), bomb the history presentation, and have a miserable rest of the day.  Friday after school: Be fucking bored, plot to get Ms. Cooper fired  Saturday: Sleep in, probably have to do chores, more boredness, at 8:00 pray for a huge thunderstorm on the Horizon Players show so their power goes out and allll their makeup boxes and all their crap they had to take up our god damn room for the lockin gets washed away.  Sunday: goto church, complain at everything, then be told by one or more of the advisors that it wasnt a big deal(even though its a HUGE fucking big deal), basically be the happiest i've been all week because i get to see my friends again, then go home and be fucking bored.  Think i'm too bitchy? Here's what you should do:  1. Go and shut the hell up because I don't care what you think. 2. See above. 3. give me all your stuff 4. listen to some rap and get yourself allllll stupided up 5. staple your head to a table 6. Swallow Liquid Nitrogen  Hopefully Cheryl will have her movie-watching party soon. That will kick ass.

      God dammit!!!!!  The stupid lockin has been cancelled!!! wtf!!  It was the ONLY fucking thing I was looking forward to all week!!!  It's because the stupid-shit production decided they needed our lock-in room for a greenroom, so we have to wait!  I kept saying to myself, "Just finish this project, work REALLY hard on it, because you're gonna have a kickass lockin on saturday which will RULE!!", but i guess I can't fucking say that anymore.  Why the fuck do they need more room for makeup? They already have the entire FUCKING CHURCH!!! AAHHHHHH!!!!!!  I'm too fucking pissed to type right now. My hands are shaking too much with anger.

      Well, my puter's fixed, sorry for not updating earlier.  My parents are fucking arguing about the remote control again. My mom has this thing where it's impossible for her to use it, and we tell her again and again, the nicest way possible, how to use it. We're one step short of just writing fucking instructions and stapling them to the wall. It's fucking ridiculous.  And each time she forgets how easy it is, she comes, bitchy as ever, to my dad arguing about how "i don't think it has to be that hard!" and it's always like "if there is an easier way, don't you think we would have found it by now?"  So now I'm blasting Poets Of The Fall out the door in the hopes that they'll think "Oh shit, we're arguing, and we're fucking our son up, we might just wanna shut the hell up and get over it."]  Fuck.

      It's my birfday, bitches!  I turned 16 on January 13, last toosday.  Now I'm wondering when I'll have a party.  You don't have to be a present, but it would be greatly appreciated. Shaunda gave me a card, and a couple people gave a spare dollar :-P  I've decided that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best movie ever. And not for the obvious reasons, either. Even though they are a big part of it.  Remember that first thing where Michael Palin just talked on and on about opression of the weak? It was after that scene that I decided.  If anybody has any party ideas or wants to help throw me one, please PLEASE give me a call. It would be better than any present to throw a kick ass party to remember for a long time.

      hmm... a couple things have happened that I feel need elaboration.  First, i ran into a childhood friend of mine named Jerry while at Frys the other day... he works there. I talked to him for a second, then got confused because i was actually TALLER than him, and left.  Second, in about an hour and 10 minutes, it'll be my birthday. Whoopee. I haven't even planned for it, and only Alex said "happy birthday." Thanks again.  Ooh, so guess what? Bush has decided to go back to the moon! Wheee!  Uhh... this will help us... how?!?! I bet he's gonna ask for money to do it quicker. The jackass. I hope he dies.  In fact, here's a list of some people lately who I really think need to die.  -Orlando Bloom(he's a white nerd just like me, but he is rich and has more fans. what gives?)  -Ashton Kutcher(The man-whore, he's filming a really serious movie, but it will be impossible to get into it because he looks so f@(#ing goofy all the time!)  John Ritter.  Oh, wait.    (P.S. i just said that about john ritter because i needed the name of a dead guy for that joke to work. I love john ritter, I think he's a badass.)

You are a very passionate person, though sometimes forceful and destructive you have a goal in life, even if that goal is just to make it another day. Fire consumes and purifys, it also protects. There is always caution with fire because once it is started on something there is no telling how much it can destroy. Fire people have the same tendency when mad you could be a candle burning but if someone tips you over...    urlLink   What's your element     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You, my friend are a true individual.

      This is one of those number quizzes where i tell you about myself. I usually wouldn't do one of these, but it's time to let people know how much ass i kick in numbered-list form.  *NOTE* if I didn't answer a question, for example, if it didn't pertain to me, I just omitted the question.  Name: Jesse Snider  1. Act your age – What the hell are you talking about? Age? I lost count at 59356.  3. Chore you hate – Yard work. I hate yardwork.  4. Dad's name - Richard.  6. Favorite actor – I have one of these every once in a while, but then i decide they're full of crap. Lately it's been Tom Cruise, I'm really respecting him right now for The Last Samurai.  7. Gold or silver - Gold. You can mold it fairly easily.  8. Hometown – Irving Texas   9. Instruments you play – I play drums sometimes, and the Dulcimer.  10. Job title – You all know this one, professional ass-kicker.  11. Kids – What about them?  12. Living arrangements – Let's see... my futon is arranged into "bed-mode" near my door, and my bed is in the corner, while my computer is in my room's inset. Just kidding. I live with me mom, dad, and brother.  13. Mom's name - Kellie. Why were the mom&dad questions all spaced out?  15. Overnight hospital stays – None. I don't even think i've ever been there because of me being sick. Last time i remember, i visited my mom earlier after she had surgery.  16. Phobia – It's even hard for me to believe sometimes, but i am claustrophobic in certain situations. Like, when thinking about Saddam Hussein's hole, knowing you couldn't get out just by pushing, is kinda unsettling.  *snaps out of it* HEY!!! Shaddap! I has no phobias!!!  17. Quote you like – "Can I just play devil's advocate for a minute? You commie bitch!"  18. Religious affiliation – Athiest/UU. Just as an example of how non-christian i am, I don't say the pledge of alleigance.  19. Siblings – 1 brother.  20. Time you wake up? TECHNICALLY i wake up at 6:00 on school days, but it ends up being around 6:15. On other days, who the hell cares?  21. Vegetable you refuse to eat – Any kind of heated/cooked vegetable. They're not meant to be served in an almost-liquid state in spaghetti, people!   22. Worst habit – Being an asshole at things i really couldn't care about. Like, this is a stoopid example, but i'll be playing Star Wars Galaxies, every time it informs me that i've entered or left a city, i almost uncontrollably think in a sarcastic tone, "Woah, thanks for telling me, jackass, i might not have known!" Then i kick myself in the foot for being such an idiot.  23. X-rays you've had – Teef. Lotsa lotsa teef.  24. Yummy food you make – Hambuggah patties, bitch! What, what?   25. Zodiac Sign - Capricorn. The goat. The SUPER-goat!  26. Last Cigarette: Fuck you, smoking is for the weak.  29. Last Library Book Checked Out: Uhh.... uhmm.. It was something for a research project in Garling's class, i'm sure.  30. Last Movie Seen In a Theatre: Last Samurai.  31. Last Book Read: Well, I'm in the middle of reading The Action Hero's handbook, but I last read Timeline for History class.  32. Last Cuss Word Uttered: I think it was "Bum clouds," but since that's not really a cuss word, it was probably something like "asswipe" or "asspancake."  33. Last Beverage Drank: Apple juice. Woot woot.  34. Last Food Consumed: Those mini deep dish pizzas.  35. Last Phone Call: I think to bitch at matt for galaxies :-P  36. Last TV Show Watched: That 70's show. The only sitcom worth watching.  37. Last Time Showered: This morning.  38. Last Shoes Worn: My torn up brown without the laces(tard shoes)  39. Last CD Played: Moby- 18  40. Last Soda Drank: Dont' do the soda, but my last soda drank was probably an accidental sip of Coke.  41. Last Thing Written: Wtf- this is a WRITTEN quiz, you fuckshank!  42. Last Key Used: House key.  43. Last Words Spoken: "Well i think you should shoot him."  44. Last Sleep: This morning. I didn't take a nap today.   45. Last IM: Probably talking to my cousin about how he's gonna let me borrow Gothic 2 on my birthday :-P  46. Last Ice Cream Eaten: mmmmarble slab chocolate with Reeses Peanut Butter cups. Mmmmmm  49. Last Time Dancing: Probably the Blue Man DVD party... if you consider stylish jumping up-and-down dancing.  50. Last Show Attended: As in concert? Blue man, baby!  51. Last Big Car Ride: Long trip, to grandparents house. Lots of people, FROM grandparents house.  52. Last thing you smelled: The... air? Well actually, I was trying to pick up the scent of this gnome that's been stalking me around my house all day. Only caught the dog.  53. Last Annoyance: This asswank at the movies, picks up his fucking cell phone and starts talking on it at the climax of The Last Samurai, what i heard was this:  "They are all... perfect.." *RING RING!!! I DON"T SOUMND LIKE A FUCKING PHONE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SHIT ASS RING TONES OUT THERE YOU STUPID FUCKS!!!* "Hello? I can't talk right now, i'm in a movie!"  I proceeded by turning around and shouting:  "Nice job, you fuckjack! You just ruined the movie for 50-or so people! I hope you die!"  54. Last Disappointment: When i won at poker on new years. ME!! I cheated though, it was fun. I had folded with a 25, but i kept in the game and just kept betting till i won. :-P  55. Last Time Scolded: Playing my electronic drumset too loud while my dad was sleeping *sigh*  56. Last Shirt Worn: My bamboo hawaiian shirt.  57. Last Web Site Visited: www.megagames.com- great pre-release gaming news and such  58. Last song you listened to: Seven- David Bowie(Album = hours). I wish i still had that album.  59. Last person that made your heart skip a beat: I don't remember who, or how, but it wasn't how this question was meant to sound... it was more of an insane surprise or shock.  60. Last movie you watched: Harry potter and the chamber of secrets. The movies are good, I just think the books are unbearable.  61. Watch it with anyone?: Myself. My parents and brother went out to dinner with some people I hate.  62. Last time you went to the mall: Jason- to see The Last Samurai and dodge the cops at closing times.  64. Last person you missed: Uhh... it was probably someone I had business with.  65. Last CD you Bought: David Bowie: Heathen   66. The most beautiful thing you saw: Something beautiful enough to be described as "The most beautiful thing you saw" probably can't be described, unless you're a shallow piece of idiot-candy that many of you are.  67. Last lyric stuck in your head: "The gods forgot they made me... so I forgot them too..."

      This has been the longest it's been between postings.  First thing's first:      Hmm, guess it cut out more than I thought.  Anyway, I saw this ad and almost puked as much as the atkins diet would make you.  Look at that woman that's advertising. How much you wanna bet that she has never been fat or in need of the atkins diet ever? She looked(before her head got cut off in this picture) like the kind of person who would think that Atkins was some kind of makeup brand, and here she is showing off, making fat people sad enough to buy countless books and brand name foods so maybe they could lose weight.  But, guess what? People who would actually gain anything from this diet aren't the only ones who are gonna use it. Oooh no. You've forgotten about the countless masses of non-fat people who seem to think that the world revolves around them, and try to make people sorry for them by throwing away their dignity on talk shows. I'm not talking about anyone in particular, mind you, all i'm trying to say is that some people need to get the fuck over themselves and realize that their petty problems aren't going to get them anywhere.  "oh, they call me names!"  Join the fucking club, okay? EVERYBODY gets called names. E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y. Noone is left out. It's a part of life. You're too fucking used to being pampered, and the moment someone does something you don't like, you act like the world has done you wrong. Get over yourself.  Now. What have I done since last posting?  X-mas. Good. Got Deus Ex, Tron 2.0, the best 3d card on the market, an electronic drum set, some family get-together game involving remote controls, a subscription to galaxies, and.... clothes. Oh! and the new Bowie album. I like his new stuff better than his old stuff mostly.  I sort of played a joke on my brother.  Somehow my mom got the idea in her head that he likes Dave matthews(when infact he hates him), and i had a brain fart and forgot, so we got him one of his CDs for x-mas.  Then new years. What a crock of shit. My family and I played poker, but then we get to 2004, and everybody parties, even though none of us know what for. It's just another year. It's just because we went around the sun once. Wheee.  Screw 2004. I cheated at poker. When i folded and got 24, i stayed in the game, and WON. That shows how stupid that game is. If you lose you can still win.  I was watching this thing on MTV, the "top 15 top videogame countdown," and i would just like to say right now that all console(some xbox and ps2 players are exempt) players can go fuck off and die right now. Metal Gear Solid 2 was NOT an inspirational game that "changed the surface of gaming." Thief was. System shock was. Doom. Tony Hawk's pro skater.  NBA Slamball 2002 does not count as inspirational to today's games, because a new one comes out EVERY YEAR.  Zelda doesn't count either. Some short kid with a japanese girl's voice ducking under his shield doesn't count as good gameplay. Just because the same 15 second loop is drilled into your head on the NES system does NOT make it a good song.  And dear god, people, Final Fantasy? Not the game so much as 2 things.  1. The name- Squaresoft are complete retards. They seem to not realize that if they had made ACTUAL names for their games, instead of having a FINAL fantasy, then having another FINAL fantasy after the first FINAL fantasy, Square could have been known as the makers of great turn-based RPG games, since the only similarity to the games beside the turn-style and the constant bad character design is that there's always a character names Sid. But noooo, they chose to make me hate them by making me remember their games by rucking NUMBER.  2. The people who play the game- They decide that NON-EXISTANT people are so cool that they decide to dress up like them. At least in star trek they're modeling themselves after actual humans. I guess that the Final Fantasy "house-players" are better because some of them actually LOOK like who they're supposed to be(although there still are some 60 year old women in skin tight tube tops).  I'm done for now.  NOTICE: I still love Blue Man Group. If any bluepies miss me, i'll try to check back on the boards more often. Just IM me to kick my ass back in gear.

      My mom decided 2 weeks ago to confuse the shit out of me. She basically said "here, quickly! Sign up for this life changing course which should be planned out far, FAR ahead but is being done at the last moment!"  So I'm sitting here like "whaaa?" and she makes me pick 3 of my teachers to put as references, and write about my pretty much day-to-day plan for what i'm going to do for the REST OF MY LIFE.  I'm still confused, and tomorrow I have to go in to bomb an interview in front of these IISM board people interviewing me for the course i know nothing about.  "So why do you want to do this course?"  "Uhm... cake?"  "Ah, so you've heard of our daily cake parties?"  "*phew*"  "What was that?"  "Uhh... Yes. Cake good."  "And what would you like to do as a job for the rest of your life?"  "Ugh... Erm... Egggggh!!!! ~head explodes~"  That's how I think that interview will go.  So, the Blue Man dallas fan group decided that we weren't gonna die, so we're desperately trying to think up shit to do. Noone has had any ideas so far. We have an artist/photographer and a theatre-savvy person, and we havent come up with an idea thus far. Wow. X-D We shall prevail!

      I was gonna write an article about Bush, but I had an equally interesting conversation with my cousin:  I play tuba: hey ShuChoMouff: hey ShuChoMouff: sup? I play tuba: nuttin much I play tuba: readin ur journal I play tuba: i wish i had stuff to bitch about ShuChoMouff: i just see shit like this in school, or its referred to, and i wonder if there's any way to make it interesting to me, which ends up being my bitching I play tuba: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I play tuba: well I play tuba: i wish i payed more attention ShuChoMouff: like I'm about to write about how Bush has no fucking right to ban gay marriages ShuChoMouff: i mean, why does he even care? I play tuba: is he banning it? I play tuba: is he trying? ShuChoMouff: hes trying to pass an amendment I play tuba: im going to assasinate him ShuChoMouff: we both are ShuChoMouff: ive had dreams about it I play tuba: with what? I play tuba: rockets launcher? ShuChoMouff: hmm... I play tuba: rockets launcher ShuChoMouff: we could make him eat mexican food till his colon explods I play tuba: ha! ShuChoMouff: or melts I play tuba: yea ShuChoMouff: whichever comes first ShuChoMouff: because mexican food explodes like a bitch I play tuba: i could fat in his face and make him die I play tuba: i think i said this at the lockin I play tuba: but I play tuba: the reason he is like this ShuChoMouff: no man, because a fart is a sign of manliness I play tuba: is cause hes from Texas ShuChoMouff: fucking texans ShuChoMouff: Nothing good(except the badass people i have found so far) has ever come from texas I play tuba: i know I play tuba: and it makes me mad  Then I started ranting about stuff even I didn't care about, then I went into my "disclosure agreement"  ShuChoMouff: want me to remove the ** in yer screenname? I play tuba: why would u do that? I play tuba: nah ShuChoMouff: so people dont spam you- i just do it to be nice I play tuba: its ok ShuChoMouff: well fuck you- i already did it I play tuba: lmao  So yeah, that puts my Bush agreement into perspective. I'll write about it again later when I don't have to succumb to the human requirement of knocking myself unconsious for 8 hours. Nighty night.

      Anorexia isn't a disease. Anorexics are just stubborn idiots. I'm sorry, but it's true. They won't(notice, I didn't say can't) see that they're skinny already, and eat a god damn sandwich.  They're skinny bitches who decide that they need to be even SKINNIER bitches, because for some reason, life has gone out of style.  Or, maybe they were overweight, went on a diet, and turned into a skinny bitch, and the cycle continues.  My stoopid health teacher decided that we needed to learn about skinny bitches, and it is then when I came up with this theory. We watched this movie showing a bunch of skinny bitches looking in the mirror, with a reporter asking them "what do you see?"  All the answers were the same- "A fat girl... I can't see my bottom rib while all my others are about to cut through, and my pelvic bone isnt protruding as dangerously as all my friends' are!"  These stupid parents keep thinking its a "phase" or some sort of disease, but it's just downright stupitidy.   If you call things "gay" when you really mean "stupid," go shut the fuck up and die.  And no, i'm not gay you fuckshits, I just know a bunch of them and i'm sick and tired of all you wifebeating prejudice assrapes not realizing how much of a big useless monkeycock you are and killing yourselves.  Why the fuck did people start doing this all the sudden? Some hick on a farm was taught that gays were stupid and somehow got admitted into Public Schooling.  Teacher: Who wants to color?  Class: Yay!  Little Billy-joe-bob-jimmy-bob-jim: Naaw, miss! That's gay!  Everyone: *GASP*  LBJBJBJ: Yeah! that's gay!  Class: *IQ drops 158 percent*  I think that's what happened. It's the only logical explanation to why how every kid in the world got retart-i-fyed.   On another topic, fuck you and your low carb diets. I'm sick of people telling me not to eat a burger because whole wheat bread is bad for you. Jesus, and I thought Vegitarians were bad. Now we're completely contradicting what we said was healthy less than a year ago! What the fuck?!  My mom, rather than eat the devil bread, now orders McDonalds' breakfast with JUST THE EGGS AND SAUSAGE, making a grease-o-rama. Its not like eating bread makes you the Blueberry girl from Willy Wonka. I fucking love peanutbutter sandwiches, and next time someone tells me about how great Atkins is, i'm gonna rip their throat out.  And don't test me- I'm really pissed off on this subject. I about killed my cousin(luckly there was a completely beat-up-able trashcan near me) for responding to my remark "it's hot in here" with the Nelly lyrics. I fucking hate Nelly and hope he dies a painful gunshot wound to the stomach.

         I just had one of those real eye-opening experiences. I'm not sure when, or where it happened, as it usually is... but it happened.     You know the feeling... where you all of the sudden realize that... well, it's hard to put it into words, because it's a thousand different feelings at once.     Imagine... imagine you're walking, down a street, or browsing in Blockbuster or something... and then you accidentally catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror or something, and can't help but stop to look. You look at it and just get this wierd feeling, it shocks you and says "This is you. You are an insignificant speck in the world around you, billions of different people are on their own trivial agendas, and, surrounded by this, is you."     I'm not saying i'm having a depression streak, far from it. I feel anything but sad.     I don't remember if i've written about this before(even if i had, it needs to be said again), but stop and take a look at yourself right now. You're sitting in your chair, slouching, staring at your computer screen at this blinding white page, maybe with some music on, and chatting with people on the side.      There are, at any given time, a couple hundred million doing basically the same thing. And there are the others sleeping, or eating, or putting clothes in their dresser, rehearsing for a band, singing, watching TV, exercising, at school, at a party, bored out of their minds, brushing their teeth, shaving, washing dishes, taking out the trash, scrubbing floors, working a cash register, putting together little plastic toy tea-pots, weaving wicker baskets, putting bits of exploded goat into little pots, harvesting moon rocks in New Jersey, making a pancake that can run for president, throwing water at the poor monkey that had no money to pay rent for his bedroom that happened to be in the bathroom of Starbucks and asked a rich cow for money but she made him paint her feet but he missed and painted her legs so she got angry and now he lives in the street being very sad while getting water thrown at him.... but that's besides the point.  The point is that there are a gabilzilmilion things going on at any given time behind your back, and you, and I are oblivious to it.  I love to weave wicker baskets.

      Okay, so the lockin kicked ass, but AJ had to be a dick and fall asleep :-P That's what ya get for drinking 15 Mr. Pibbs at 10:00, eh? You shoulda brought a case of Bawls, sucka!  We shouldn't have watched Bruce Almighty... or Thirteen for that matter.  What a fucking stupid movie Thirteen was. And it's winning a Golden Globe? Christ!  When we had to watch it, I expressed my concern, but since it turned out to be either that, or wander the halls alone, I decided to watch it, I just decided to tough it out. But, I did make it known that I retained all rights to make fun of the movie so much it would make the director cry, and noone could tell me otherwise. And I did.  It was about a 13 year old girl who meets this mexican whore, and decides that sluttery is the way to go. And along the way, destroys her family, gets the shit punched out of her, AND gives a black guy a blow job. At least it was implied.  At this one point, her mom notices her belly button ring (which she did not allow her to get... ooh, the suspense!), and asked the question, "what is that?" as if she didn't know. I promptly rang out "It's a muffin! What the fuck does it look like?"  We had to plan this youth service thingy, and it was decided that some Blue-Mannery should be implemented. Drumbone will definitley be used, but my cousin has decided that she needs to sing something the offertory(you know, when the church takes your money every sunday?), so if they decide that it has to be a blue man song, I need funding to build a PVC instrument. Which is good if it turns out to be free for me, but we only have until May and we've just started planning.  Ughums, school starts again tomorrow so I'd better start the sleepin.

      That reminds me of a rather amusing anec-dote. I once knew this girl who told me, "I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual."  I responded by saying "Well, I'm not honest, but you're interesting."

      Oh dear, I've pissed him off. Now he's gonna sick the crazy guy at my door.  It's not my fault I hate him. I don't usually have grudges, but I really don't like it when people threaten me.  He was marked insane a couple years ago, and even though everyone says he's cured, they probably mean it only in the legal way. Where the judges say he's legal, even though they haven't even spend 5 minutes in a room with him.  Last year he sent threats to me because I decided to take a stand when he made my cousin cut himself. He said that he knew who I was, and that I wasn't a threat.  I almost got scared, and I would have if I was an idiot and didn't know that he was just el chico loco with empty threats over aim.  And now he has joined my church and wants to come to the lockin tomorrow, after being decidedly christian. Hmm...  It has been said that the matter has been discussed and that he would'nt start anything, but it was also said that he wasn't crazy, when obviously he still needed major psychiatric help. Not the fake kind for normal people, I'm talking about the people who can be called doctors, and can perscribe medication.  I guess we'll see how it goes, I'm still confused as to why he would convert from christian so quickly.  I really don't like him, as I hate all people who threaten me.

      What the fuck!!!  Hot Topic took legal action against mall monkeys! Those little bastards.  Mall monkeys was a webcomic about people that hung out in the mall all the time, and even though they did make fun of hot topic, they never said they were bad. This proves that Hot Topic are evil bastards that should be killed. They are taking legal action against him for slander.  And, this is the most sickening part of it- on the Hot Topic main page, there is a circle in the main graphic that says "say anything." Obviously they're just a corrupt company with CEOs and lawyers that dont even understand what Say Anything means.  I never even liked hot topic. It's for posers.  On another topic, Time fucking sucks. I couldn't get to school on time today, and my teacher made me STAND UP for 2 hours. It's a stupid punishment, but standing up wasnt the worst problem- its that I got in trouble for not getting to school at 7:35. That time is ridiculous. (Cesar made fun of me for saying Ridiculous, and I don't even know why, because if anything, he should go kill himself because he doesn't know what ridiculous means. He's an idiot. Sorry for speaking english, you fucking bitch-fuck. Would you rather ME say "That's fucking crunk, bitch!"? Huh? Would ya? I hope you die.)  Mr. Reyes heard me talking about how stoopid having to stand up was and i swear he was almost gonna get mad. At ME. I've never been late before, I have the right to talk.  Adam and I are gonna hack time so we get 36 hour days. That would be better. And, as a side project, we're also gonna make it to instead of sleeping, we just plug ourselves in at night. It'll feel better than sleeping, too. Our ideas rule, even though this is one of the ones ive ever had that can't be done.  Here's an idea that can be done though.  It's a way to keep illegal immigrants out of the US.  Ready for this?  Flaming river of gas.  I said it. It would totally work, too. It would extend all the way around the U.S.  First, it would need to be built, which will create jobs for people in construction(ditch-diggers 200 fold), and gas manufacturing.  Then, once it was done, we would turn it on and people in Mexico and Canada(and ESPECIALLY.... Well, never mind) would be scared to come, too.  If I were in charge, we'd have some fun, too. We'd turn it off at random intervals, tricking the immigrants to think that it may be safe to come over. But then... BAM we turn it back on again! Ha ha! They would burn, and we would laugh! At least I would laugh.

      I got a lot of "negative" feeback after that Fucking Sucks list i made a couple days ago.  First off, it was just a nematoad joke, okay? Are you saying... you're defending the nematoads?  I would just like to take some time off to copy and paste a list that I made a while back about what to do if you dont like my opinions.  1. Go and shut the hell up because I don't care what you think. 2. See above. 3. give me all your stuff 4. listen to some rap and get yourself allllll stupided up 5. staple your head to a table 6. Swallow Liquid Nitrogen  Now, if you can find a valid arguement for, say, why Ska is the best music in the world, or why Emos aren't just depressed momma's boys, or how all goths SHOULDN'T just go kill themselves, let me know. Who knows, if i like you, i might listen.

K/J-pop fucking sucks.  (Note from adam: "u forgot gamers fucking suck")  (another note from adam: "87 year old transvestite strippers fucking suck"  A lot of things suck, but nothing sucks as much as Nematoads. I fucking HATE nematoads. Always choking me with their toungs and taking my lunch money. DAMN YOU, NEMATOADS!!

      It's too bad I hate football. It would be an okay game if people realized it was a freakin GAME... people turn it into something other than a GAME, which is what it is, a football GAME. It's a GAME, which means it is supposed to be fun. And then your team loses and you're dissapointed, and you go home and cry like the moron you are, and I laugh that half the stadium got their hearts broken.  I fucking hate the superbowl. At least it wasnt in dallas this year, jesus christ that was the worst. You fucking retards need to die.

      Rally. I left before it was over. And it wasn't "chickening out" like some people called it, so I'm not going to say i'm sorry.  We were going to perform drumbone at the talent show, but they're fucking schedule idiots(as are most Unitarians), and scheduled it for 2-3 in the morning. Wtf?!   I would like to goto others- I met some cool people there. Thing is though, we only were able to get to know eachother for the first couple hours, then everybody decided to be whores and go hog the movie room. We did watch the Blue Man DVD, and that was teh sweet.  Turns out, that Chappelle's show has eliminated racism. How? At opening circle, I yelled out "I'm rick james, bitch!" and EVERYBODY else yelled out either "Charley Murphy!" in the rick james voice, or "Yeeee-yeeeahh!"  It has destroyed what it took so fondly to make fun of. Odd.  Anyway, I'm trying to make the decision of whether to rebuild the drumbone, or build a PVC instrument that can play Sing Along. They both would cost about the same, I think.  I was sick from school yesterday, due to uber allergy-ness. It was bad. Now I'm probably APV in 3 classes, but whatever.  :-O Jay Leno is having Blue Man Group perform tonight! I thought it was last night, but I was teh wrong! So watch it TOnight, or you'll get herpes!  Well, I guess it's time for school- gotta work on my website and let Welch bitch us out for not doing homework she didn't assign.  I also have some more comics on the way, they're already done, I just need to upload them- Hang tight!  As Nicholas says(I thought this was genius), later, bed bugs and stuff.

      Today = suck. It's official.  I was forced to run through hundreds of different scenarios of how I could bomb the Campus Techs'(the people who supposedly fix the computers at the school) office, but it was no use- they're not worth the attention.  Those shits(except for Tracy), always surly- something happens to them when they walk through that door to go to their JOB(except for that tamara bitch, i hate her.). Do those people really have to be such bitches all the time?  I walked in this morning to see what can be done about my powercord for my laptop(which got stepped on by some idiot at school), and that tamara whore says "Damn, they all come in at once!"  I said "My powercord is busted right here," as i pointed to where the damage was and handed it to her.   She decided that my complete knowledge of what the problem was unimportant, so she inspects the thing on her own, shoves it within 3 inches of my face and barks "Physical damage."  I stood there, wondering if she had heard me, and I said "Yeah, that's kind of what I came in here for..."  She said "You'll have to pay for it."  "You don't... have soldering irons?"  "Go up to the cashier on the third floor."  "How much is it?"  "I don't know, she's on the 3rd floor."  As I turned around to exit, one of the other people working there says "Sorry about your powercord!" and I turned back and said "I'm sure you are." and stormed the hell up the stairs.  Yay, the cashier wasn't there! She for some reason thought that her job was something OTHER than punching numbers, and had an "appointment" until 10:00!  A friend later told me it was gonna be 42 bucks. Fuck that, my dad and I just fixed it ourselves. We can actually DO things. I'm not worried about it "revoking" the insurance on the powercord, because IT WAS ALREADY FUCKING BROKEN!  Then, at home, the reality sets in that one of my really REALLY good friends is going to California, and I may never see him again after this year. All good things must come to an end, I suppose.  ...  The only good news for today is that I was able to  get some brainstorming done on both my Flash website in progress, and the Blue man party. I'm trying to have one at my house in April/May(although it's looking like May because of conflicting schedules). It shall be fun.  Also, sorry about not posting- absolutely nothing has happened in the past couple days that deserves use of my attention.  Also, 2 notes to whoever shops at Hot Topic:  1. Abercrombie OWNS hot topic! Literally! They're the same company!! 2. You whores would not last 2 seconds in anarchy.  That is all.

Now you can leave arguments, comments, quirrels, compliments, droppings, scuffs, idiot remarks, and random stupidness related to my posts in these comment tags. Just don't be surprised if I edit the post talking back :)  Let's hope this code worked...

      You can thank The Polyphonic Spree(Section 7) and the overall complete isolation from other human life over spring break for the following post...  Boy, I thought they were lying when they said that aloneness was terrible. I never believed them. It gets to the point where you're confused of what day it is... what time it is... you realize it's 3 in the morning when you could have sworn it was only 7 in the evening.  Yeah, i feel... alone. Whatever. Noone wants to do anything, anyway. Everybody won't get off the topic of girlfriends and love life and stuff, and it's not like i feel left out, I know the torment and pain it brings people, but...  I just try and make things better for other people. There, I guess that's a good enough explanation. I try and make other people's lives a little bit happier, because- who knows- they could be going through a horrible trauma, their family could have burned to death in a fire... they failed their first math test in 7 years... whatever. I guess that's  my  meaning of life- for those who I feel deserve it, they should be brought all the joy that can possibly be given.  Sure, I have views. I post them here. You should know that by now. I try and fool myself and say that this is for my "personal records," and for me, just public for other people to look at, bullshit. I try to write stuff so people will laugh, and go "Hey, that was funny, I needed that" before going back to whatever it was they were doing.  I suppose this "love" stuff isn't for me yet- i know that I'm an ugly shit and that there isn't much I can do about it.  Why am I complaining? I have a good life. I have a nice house, good parents, a brother who I can, for the most part, tolerate. But the planes of the physical, and those of the emotional are far different.  You people always have one question on your minds- "Who do you like?" Well, since you seem to have no respect for other people's privacy, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of knowing. It's not like I had an answer anyway. I decided that it was futile to decide something of which I had no knowledge of the outcome.  Aaah! Crap! Self pity post! Bad, bad self! ~hits self in head multiple times~  ~looks back over post~ Hmm, I suppose most of that is true. Meh.

      Okay, here we go- a couple friends of mine started a clan for Counter-Strike called Team PDA(public displays of assination(you may roll your eyes now)). I've been watching them argue and scuffle about making a website, getting servers they don't need, and who is in the clan or not.  And in the midst of all this, they decide that the most important thing for them to do at this juncture is change their name to Digital Adrenaline(you may shoot yourself now). Can you get any more generic? I bet there are at least 2 other clans out there named that.  I refuse to join a clan, even if they asked me to.   [edit: I would start one, but i would never join an existing one]  Why? Because I, unlike many gamers these days, play games to have FUN. When you join a clan, you join a world of schedules, rules, and expectations. It's no FUN. I could have sworn that GAME developers developed GAMES, not serious sports.  Here's what would make me like clans- since it's just a game, and if they lose, they act like their life is over. My idea is, give them something they really need to worry about. Have it where, if your clan loses, you get shot in the knee. See? Problem solved. I'm happy because idiots are getting shot in the knee, and the clans have actually something to worry about! Drinks all round!  But of course, sport-gamers are stupid, they would never listen to reason.   I heard an arguement about Battlefield 1942 by a friend of mine, he said "Man, that game's no fun, all you do is mess around." and my rebuttle was "...isn't that the point?"  When I play a game, i'm sick of realism. I want to have my expectations of what's possible blown right out of the sky. Everybody wants me to play America's Army(a painfully realistic simulation, i don't even call it a game), which is no fun at all because you have to complete training (some of which consists of getting the entire fucking vietkong thrown at you and 3 seconds to kill them all, with having a 12 second fucking reload animation) before you can even get to play with your friends. It's stupid shit, i'm gonna go play TRON 2.0 some more.  That one was good. It took everything Tom Clancy and the folks who came up with the rules of football said, and kicked them out on their asses. TRON 2.0 = TRON + badass + totally kicking the ass of my perception of what's possible(!!) + Rebecca Romijn.  The levels never got boring (Halo, Enter the Matrix), the combat never got monotonous(Serious Sam, Serious Sam, Serious FUCKING Sam), and the multiplayer doesn't lag like a whore on most occasions.  Too bad i've beaten it twice on it's hardest difficulty level. That's enough for me, unless i want to replay it just to see the good-looking cut-scenes.  I can't think up a good ending for this, so I'll leave you with...  END OF LINE.

      I'm sick and tired of all these Unitarians raising their kids to be completely stupid and closed to the REAL world around them. Like, when we went to this Group Dynamix crap, everybody there was born and raised in a little UU bubble that made them cringe at anything different. Sound familiar?  We were playing Mario Kart 64(Oldschool, huh?) at the group dynamix thing and me and my friend AJ, who were born and raised in a very free-form, bubble-free environment(in the REAL FUCKING WORLD), were playing and throwing the usual gaming insults at one another (you suck, haha i pwned your ass, etc.), and teh other two uu kids who were playing just got all insulted and went "we don't have to play video games with violence, could you just please quit calling eachother stupid?"  We were kinda at a loss of what to do so I decided to go back in the "gym" room and participating in the beating of eachother with giant heavy sticks. Well, one thing led to another and Nicholas ended up beating me in the face really hard with it, almost knocking me cold. After getting up, I had this horrible headache that wouldn't go away, and it stayed for another 2 days. I got sick and threw up on the way home after that lockin.  So, the point of the story is, Bubble uu's made me sick.   Ehehehee  chad_wina: OOOO chad_wina: cleaning is oh so fun ShuChoMouff: ahahah ShuChoMouff: you're kidding, right? ShuChoMouff: Just kidding. ShuChoMouff: See, i'm kidding. ShuChoMouff: but you're not kidding. ShuChoMouff: the tables have turned! chad_wina: hahahahahahhaah   ShuChoMouff: :-O has you seen Donnie Darko? RabidBabyBunny: nope ShuChoMouff: dear god it was good ShuChoMouff: you should have come to the movie night RabidBabyBunny: i was babysitting RabidBabyBunny: and grounded ShuChoMouff: Phour what? RabidBabyBunny: school stuff ShuChoMouff: did you bomb the counselors again? RabidBabyBunny: yeah.. ShuChoMouff: I told you..   So we went to movie night, and we watched 3 movies(and slept through the last one i'm going to list), History of the world part I, Bowling for Columbine, Donnie Darko, and Life of Brian.  History of the world was funny yet cliched, bowling for columbine was great, Life of Brian i had seen, but man... Donnie Darko... wow.  The movie is so beyond words in the meaning it conveys, that it's hard for me to explain it to people to where it makes sense.  Sure, I could tell you the plot. The plot is about a kid named Donnie Darko that is seeing a psychiatrist for what his parents are hoping isn't schitzophrenia. He also had sleep walking problems, and one night he wondered out of his house, down to the golf course, and saw a giant intimidating looking man in a rabbit suit that told him when the world is going to end. The next morning after being awoken by golfers, he returns home to find that a jet engine had crashed through his room, and would have killed him if he hadn't been sleepwalking.  But it's so much more than that.  After the crash, the rabbit(named frank) tells him to do things, that are violent in nature, but usually have a positive outcome.  For instance, there was a person named Jim Cunningham who had come up with this "great" psychological treatment for kids that basically lumped all of human emotions into two sections- fear and love. This is obviously flawed, but i'm not going to go into it.  Anyway, the rabbit makes him set Cunningham's house on fire, and while searching the wreckage, fire crews found a Kiddie porn dungeon. He was arrested. Genius.  Some of the conversations they have through the movie are so powerful that they stick in your mind. It probably has one of the largest collection of good quotes i've ever seen.  --------------------------------------  Donnie: First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village, but the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario, it just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants. That's what's so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. What's the point of living if you don't have a dick?  Donnie: How can you do that?  Frank(the rabbit): I can do anything I want. And so can you.  [At the school assembly speaking out against Jim Cunningham]  Donnie: Do you want your sister to lose weight? Tell her to get off the couch, stop eating twinkies and maybe go out for field hockey. You know what? No one ever knows what they want to be when they grow up. You know it takes a little, little while to find that out, right, Jim? And you... yeah, you. Sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet? Well, you know what? Maybe... you should lift some weights, or uh, take a karate lesson and the next time he's tries to do it, you kick him in the balls.  Frank: Twenty-eight days... six hours... forty-two minutes... twelve seconds. That... is when the world... will end.  Gretchen: You're weird.  Donnie: Sorry.  Gretchen: No, that was a compliment.  Gretchen: Donnie Darko? What the hell kind of name is that? It's like some sort of superhero or something  Donnie: What makes you think I'm not?  Donnie: Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?  Frank: Why do you wear that stupid man suit?  Donnie: [in a letter] Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and... there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep. I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to.  Kitty Farmer: I'll tell you what he said. He asked me to forcibly insert the Life Line exercise card into my anus.  Donnie: [to his mother] How's it feel to have a wacko for a son?  Rose Darko: It feels wonderful.  Roberta Sparrow: Every creature on this earth dies alone  Gretchen: ...what if you could go back in time, and take all those hours of pain and darkness and replace them with something better?  Donnie: You are such a fuckass.  Elizabeth: Did you just call me a fuckass? You can go suck a fuck.  Donnie: Oh, please, tell me Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?  Donnie: Frank, when's this gonna stop?  Frank: You should already know that.  Dr. Lilian Thurman: The search for God is absurd?  Donnie: It is if everyone dies alone.  Jim Cunningham: Son... DO YOU SEE THIS? This is an Anger Prisoner. A textbook example. DO YOU SEE THE FEAR, PEOPLE? This boy is scared to death of the truth. Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man. I believe you are searching for the answers in all the wrong places...  Donnie: You're right, actually. I am pretty- I'm, I'm pretty troubled and I'm, I'm pretty confused. But I. . .and I'm afraid. Really, really afraid. Really afraid. But I... I... I think you're the fucking Antichrist.  [Watching George Bush Snr. give a speech on TV]  Edward Darko(donnie's dad): Tell 'em, George.  Samantha Darko: What's a fuckass?  Rose Darko: Do you even know who Graham Greene is?  Kitty Farmer: I think we've all seen Bonanza.  Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff: I am not going to be able to continue this conversation  Donnie: Why?  Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff: I could lose my job.  Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff: And did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That maybe darkness is part of their natural development.  [Donnie tries to kiss Gretchen and she pulls away]  Donnie: Well I-I, sorry I...  Gretchen: Donnie wait...  Donnie: I like you a lot...  Gretchen: I just want it to be... at a time when... it...  Donnie: When what?  Gretchen: When it reminds me just...  Donnie: When it reminds you of how beautiful the world can be?  Gretchen: Yeah...  [turns her head]  Gretchen: and right now there's some fat guy over there staring at us.  Kitty Farmer: Okay, now girls... I want you to concentrate. Failure is not an option. And Bethany, if you feel the need to vomit up there... just swallow it.  [Donnie is under hypnosis by his therapist] Donnie: My parents didn't get me what I wanted for Christmas.  Dr. Lilian Thurman: What did you want?  Donnie: Hungry Hungry Hippos.  Dr. Lilian Thurman: And how did you feel, being denied these hungry, hungry hippos?  Donnie: Regret. Dr. Lilian Thurman: What else makes you feel regret, Donnie?  Donnie: [suddenly breaking into a wide grin] That I did it again...  Karen Pomeroy: A famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations, 'Cellar Door' was the most beautiful.  ------------------------------------------  Some things in the movie were never made clear, and left open to speculation. It works for me. The reason The first Matrix was so popular was because it only showed you about 2% of the universe the Wachowski brothers had created, and left the rest up to you to decide how you wanted Zion to look, or how many people actually lived outside the computer.  Then the second and third movies came out, and it tried to do so much that it wasn't meant to do. That's the reason. People don't want as much imagination as you need for books, but they do want some in movies.  I was surfing the web, and i found a donnie darko forum on imdb.com(just by coincidence, i swear), and this guy named 9 reasons he liked the movie. It was okay, until this guy named Whoelse comes in and busts up the party and said "You were born in 1987? You're too young to understand this!" and wouldn't get it into his head that noone cared what he said, and it pissed me off so much that i actually signed up for the boards, just to post this:  "Whoelse is pissing me off enough to actually make me sign up to this board to say this...   "There's one on every board."   Congratulations, you stupid assrape! Everybody on the internet hates you!   You're just a sick little person that gets on the internet trying to make people feel bad, just so you can get a little pleasure because you actually have a speck of power behind your keyboard in your safe house.   Oh, and yes, Donnie Darko is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It gave me something to ponder over, which is good, because I haven't had a good "thinking" topic since my discovery of Blue Man Group.   Well, chances are you won't ever see me post here again. Ciao."

      Yet another shitty week of shit. My brother's an ass, My friends wont quit being shits just because they outnumber the whiteys now, my parents are being uptight, Ms. Welch is an evil whore who should die, and to top it all off, one of my drumsticks broke(not that big a deal, in fact it was kinda funny).  If it weren't for like 3 people "understanding" the shit that happens that  I complain about, I don't know what I'd be doing.  First off, everybody has decided to argue with me over aim, instead of not being a wussy and confronting me in real life. What gives? I think they're afraid of me. They can sit in their comfortable chair planning out what theyre going to say, where nothing I can say or do can hurt them. It's happened this way ever since the "Christian Wars" as I am now referring to them, where everyone in middle school found out I was athiest and decided that it was their destiny to convert me. None of them succeeded.  Oh well. I guess I have to live with everyone being a complete wussy.  Now my friend's lied to me, and I've had to deal with his shit for the past couple weeks now. He used to be cool, too, but then he decided sometime last year he was gonna become an asshole and take everyone down with him. So today he took this bouncy ball I had and lied and said he didn't have it. Now, the bouncy ball doesnt mean shit to me, it's that he lied to me for no apparent reason.  he's said he's sorry, and says that if he wants us to "go our separate ways" after he gives the ball back, that's cool with him. I don't even know if I want to or not, I'm just so physically and emotionally tired after this week, I just don't know.  Hopefully Movie night will be good, even though I don't know how much I'll like sitting through a bunch of "independent" films(the ones from IFC from spoiled kids that are bored and make movies) all night. I suppose there's always tag.

      It's official- Ms. Welch is an evil bitch.  I explained it in an e-mail I sent to my parents:  "Just to let you know, if my grade isn’t very good in English this 6-weeks, thank Ms. Welch- she made us fail a test because she made us do it over a book we hadn’t been assigned to read.  We came into class today, and she said “We’re doing a test over the 14 chapters you were supposed to read by today” and NOBODY knew what she was talking about. She said “well I told you last time I was here! The sub gave you an assignment!”  The truth was, the last time she was here, all she said was “We’re going to watch a movie today because you guys are probably sick of English right now.”  She said nothing about reading a book, she said we were going to read it in class. The sub on Friday that we had actually said “She didn’t leave me anything to do, so basically I’m your ‘free-time director’.”  Just letting you know.   Reminder: Please don't forward this to Ms. Welch, if she doesn't remember that she didnt tell us to do anything, she will definitley not be happy with me stating her faults."  It's all true.  I actually had a GOOD christian-athiest conversation with someone the other day, and- get this- they didn't hide from behind aim! That's so cool!  It was with this girl named Denebra(i think thats how its spelled), who I originally thought wasn't the smartest person, was actually able to keep up with my athiesm arguement for more than 2 seconds and flinching out with "I'm christian, i'm not comfortable about talking about that." Props to her.  I walked by these 2 girls talking yesterday, and one of them said "Well, I wanna have kids, but I don't wanna get married."  *sigh* She was mexican, too. Do you see why I want to move?

      This seemed cool...  Post a memory of me in the comments. It can be anything you want.   Then - post this to your journal and see what people remember about you.   It could be any type of memory. Good or bad... (Post anonymously and see if i can figure out who it is if you want X-P)  i dare you to come up with something really good or embarrassing.

      I've started giving out Kickass awards to people who I feel utterly kick ass in all respects.  Current recievers are: Josh Eric  I'm not going to give you one for stuff you've done in the past, only now, so I can't automatically give all my friends awards.  Eric won for being so old school that he put a spaceballs quote in his profile...  And Josh won because he uses a friggin DOS prompt to control the universe :-O  So see,there is no general "badassery" to be had here, it's an unusual way of picking. You'll see.  Also, if you don't get the award right away(or never), don't feel bad. Kicking ass is not everyones job- if you think you should get it and you don't, I believe is that you're probably one of the ones up high, who are going to control us asskickers and tell us what to do. We bow to you.  My only 2 rules of disqualification are: 1. You ask for one 2. You become a brown noser to get one  That's it. It's fairly simple.

      Nicholas made a really long post about the lockin a week ago, so I figure I may just do the same because I have nothing better to do right now :)  Well, let's see. The day started at about 1:30 when Nicholas and I loaded our stuff into me dad's truck, headed over to Dustin's house, and loaded his guitars and amp.  Once we got there, it was... 2:30 I believe, and eeeverybody got a chance to carry *my* stuff. Just kidding, they volunteered, otherwise I would have had no problem making 18 billion + trips.  What'd I bring...  Drumbone Drumset Drumstick(s) Dulcimer (the D instrument, as some of you have been calling it) Miscellanious Drum Shit Marshmallows/Jello mix we got from Tom Thumb (Dustin said he could turn gelatin into pudding, but he never proved it XD) Backpack full of stuff we never used (like my 80+ Frisbees(Yes nicholas, AOL Cds)) CDs and fun stuff  Once we got there, I loaded all my stuff into the COA room, then brought the instruments into the Sanctuary, where we hooked up and started jamming.  AJ and I needed to practice drumbone, but we needed a 3rd blue man. We didn't practice for a while, because this annoying chick named Jerica (who was a friend of this really annoying chick named Jenny) volunteered, and AJ and I decided outright that she would be our absolute last choice, and we wanted Sarah to show up so we could make her win by default somehow.  So, AJ and I just started practicing the first part, and a mixture of Dustin and Erik volunteered to be our replacement blue man until we decided.  Dustin picked up the guitar part to drumbone really quickly, we made him watch the Drumbone scene on the DVD about 5 times, while I stayed in the sanctuary and played dulcimer for a while. I found out how to play Above on it, and spent the rest of the night perfecting the notes and the technique.  Sarah: "Did you teach yourself that?" Me: "Yep. ::keeps playing really fast::" Sarah: "You're amazing." Me: /grin "Thanks X-P"  ^^yup, I've found out how to do X-P in real life. It's just really subtle.  Okay... what'd we do next. Blue Man Auditions.  Didn't work out as well as I'd planned- we just tried out whoever was in the room. Grant got pissed at me for getting pissed at Zach and Nicholas when they were fucking around in the sound room.  I'm fucking scared of Grant, one of our "advisors." He's always giving me this look like "Who the hell are you?" and pounds me into submission when I can't find the answer to that question.  We had "checkin," which lasted fucking 2 hours because noone would be the quiet and let anybody else talk. Apparentally they had scheduled everything pretty much already. That was good. We had mediocre pizza from Cici's, which I didn't really eat much of because I wasn't hungry.  We got free reign of the sanctuary, meaning we had access to the sound system, and we could basically do whatever we wanted as long as we didn't break anything.  We started yelling "CHARLEY MURPHY!!!1" over the speakers really loud, and stuff like "I'm god!" "And I'm his unlawful son, Zeek!"  We got good at drumbone, then we decided it was time to break for a while, because my hands were hurtin and Dustin's fingers were hurtin. AJ and Eric- no wait, it was Sarah at this point, AND eric, wanted to go watch movies.  Watched Tears of the Sun and Donnie Darko at first. Me, AJ and Sarah were the movie buddies, pissing everybody else off because we wouldn't get the hell over laughing and watching the movie.  Tears of the Sun, I didn't understand much of it- Bruce Willis kills his entire troup (and many of his brain cells) to save the french chick from the matrix and christian black people in Nigeria. Of course, the US had to go in and stop the dirty fucking non-christians from stopping our missionaries' fun. Made the whole movie pointless to me.  Donnie Darko- I saw it first at movie night, and it was amazing. I've watched it about 3 billion and 5 times since then, and i was barely able to sit through the whole thing. I'm not to the point where I can recite all the lines (that part of my brain is devoted to relearning Rock Concert Movement number 237 after forgetting it), and I'm not sure if i WANT to get to that point.  It did get bothersome that Nicholas whispered everything Frank the Rabbit said, but I got over it.  The movie is amazing, but it really doesn't pertain to my life in any way, which is probably the reason why I can't watch it religiously every day like some people can. I believe a lot of things about the movie, but one thing stands out the most- Nicholas takes it VERY seriously, and debates it as casually and as often as I listen to Blue Man Group.  We went through the church service right in the middle of doing another practice on Drumbone. We have this whole sketch planned out, it's awesome. Dustin comes out, picks up the guitar, and starts playing this really hokey tune. At certain points in the song, the blue men come out one by one, from a different position. We originally had them: In a closet, hiding behind the handicap walkway up to the stage, and from behind the big wall with last-minute supplied near it.  I think though, that we should change them, because they're kind of bad places to be. I'm thinking more of- come out through the kitchen, the library, then still in the middle wall.  I was originally going to be drumming, but since AJ was having problems switching the notes at the end, I'm doing the end sliding parts. I can play every single part besides guitar, and do fancy stuff with it, but since cloning myself is out of the question, I'm working with everyone to make this the best experience possible.  It also means I have to dance.  I'm gonna try out some improv things on saturday(our dress rehearsal)- I want to walk in the audience and walk towards someone as if I'm gonna do something (while Dustin is still playing that tune on his guitar), and then AJ is going to segway into drumbone(which is really well done- no stop between Dustin's song and the first drumbone note), and I'm gonna act surprised and turn around, and all that good stuff. Then we do drumbone, pull the pipes, blah blah blah, the rest of the service, boring boring boring, speech speech, offertory, happy funtime song at the end (Gary Jules- Mad World), and then we'll probably come out for some sort of meet & greet.  The blue men are probably going to be sitting like children in the conversation with children, where someone tries to make these little 6 year olds learn about philosophy and why the little bird flew away in some sad, sad story they read every week.  We're having a guy do an impersonation of George Dubya. His dad can do Bush Sr, so we only found it appropriate.  Afterwards... some of us headed to the kitchen, while others went out to the playground. Sarah, AJ, Meaghan and I sat in the hall talking about this-or-that, and Sarah was cold, so she wanted me to come outside with her to her car, probably because the christian monster from a couple miles down the highway patrols the Horizon parking lot at night.  Eric made jokes- "Jesse, don't let her rape you- she'll get you while you aren't looking!" and I thought about saying "Yeah, I'm just afraid of what would happen if i DIDN'T go," but I didn't say it. Heh, I'm always thinking of saying stuff, but I never do.  I followed the "gang" around for a bit, and then everybody started playing hide and seek, which I didn't want to do because I was gonna end up breaking something (blind H&S), and because I had a bad headache (worse than normal, but not as bad as when Nicholas hit me in the head with the fucking guard pole X-P)  I fell asleep on the table behind Sarah, who ended up moving to the floor, and when I woke up, everybody was out and about on the playground again, and since we had moved all the instruments out of the Sanctuary, I went in and started playing Dulcimer some more.  I didn't think of sitting in a couch in the other room, because only Alan was sleeping in there and I didn't figure we were gonna go in there. Fucking bad decision on my part. I hear a huge rumble of people, and when i get there, all the couches are taken, and they're putting Dogma in the PS2. I got the shittiest seat, this uncomfortable beanbag on the floor that you couldn't lie down in, and didn't get to sit next to my movie buddies (and in turn be able to sleep).  Half way through the movies. Laura moved from the seat next to Dustin, so I took the oppurtunity to jump into her seat and sleep there the rest of the movie. I awoke to Salma Hayek saying "You did SO well" and i got pissed off because that was the part I'd seen most.  I got up, then some other people got up and started tossing the ball around, and since we got up on our own, Alan made sleeping people get up and take our garbage out :-P  I played dulcimer outside in the windy weather, which sucked because I was afraid it was gonna fall over, so i went back inside.  They had the car wash, so I'd keep going up to dustin and tell him what a horrible, horrible job he was doing ("CAR WASH" sign holder-upper) and that he failed. Heh.  Everybody left the "party" besides me, Cheryl, and Zach, the latter two fell asleep on the couches. I couldn't bring myself to stay still for some reason though, so I kept walking between rooms. It was leftover easter weekend, so all the little kids were getting all the leftover chocolate eggs they had there for some reason.  I'm running out of things to say, but I don't feel like I'm done typing yet.  Let's see, what else has happened...  I have one week to get my costume, dye gloves, and give AJ all the drum stuff he needs to practice. If only Sarah and AJ lived closer, we could go around and get stuff together, so we know exactly what we're doing.  Also, everybody has some predujice against sending e-mails on the friggin youth service e-mail list, so we're not getting any work done.   I've made my decision. I'm going to stop typing now. The Youth Service will be awesome, or I will kill it. Yes, I will kill the inatomate activity in which our group is participating.  I also apologize to all the non-church people (Irving people) who didn't understand what the fuck is going on- I tried to make it entertaining enough for anybody to read, but anywho, I congratulate you for reading this far.  I'm going to bed, it's 11:20 now, I will not be able to get up tomato morning. Good night :)  P.S. Special shoutouts to Sarah for volunteering to be a blue man. I've told you before, but you rock, and this thing will be awesome. :-D

      Oh my fucking god, I'm so stressed right now. GRRR!@1   And it seems that I have no friends who care.  This isn't one of those things where a group of people are having a  difficult time and try to help eachother out, this is all up here, in my head, because bad things have a way of turning all of you when you need it least.  For me right now,, it's like Lady Luck is a mob boss, and I can't pay my dues.

      For personal reference... This is an auction for a makeup kit that is similar to the makeup used in the show Blue Man Group.  Here is what is included in the kit:  1) 11 containers of Blue Foundation Grease Paint (1.25oz each)  2) 5 Bald Caps, 4 Mehron caps and 1 Special Effects cap, all same, and instructions on application.  3) 8oz container of Pros Aide 2 adhesive for Bald Caps.  4) a half empty 1.25oz supply of cabo bondo ridge filler (used to make transition from skin to cap seamless.  Not necessary, but usefull if the glue does not adhere, you can smear some of this stuff on and it acts like bald cap spackle.)  5) 1oz Castor Sealer (used to keep glue from deteriorating)  6) About 12 or 13oz of Pro Face Makeup Remover (in spray bottle)  7) 4oz of No Sweat Skin Prep, in spray bottle (Spray on before greasepaint and after greasepaint is applied, keeps you from sweating too much, great for fat blue men)  8) 4 oz of Invisible UV Makeup, blue (clear when applied, glows blue under blacklights, be sure to work into greasepaint to get good effect)  9) A myriad of rubbing alcohol, brushes, and other things that can be easily purchased at your local supermarket.  There are only 2 things you still have to do to be a blue man.  You have to dye gloves, which is as easy as buying latex gloves and rit dye and mixing the two until you achieve the color you want (ps- wear a pair of regular non dyed gloves under the dyed ones unless you want blue hands), and buying adhesive remover.  Rubbing alcohol works, but buying ben nye makeup remover, putting it in a spray bottle, and using that will make removing any excess adhesive easier on your skin.  Please ask all questions before bidding.  Shipping is $10.00 anywhere in the USA.  Thanks for looking and happy bidding.

      I'm really hyper. This is probably the most hyper i've been in a long time. Our Youth Service is in less than 2 weeks, may second, and it is going to ROCK. I mean- not stoning Jesus to death rock- it's going to be so awesome.  My cousin is a pimp guitaristzor, and he's really good at picking up stuff- making him perfect for the job (also because he only has to play 3 notes pretty much)  We're performing Drumbone for the youth service- AJ will be the drummer, Sarah(who is our awesome 3rd drumboner) will be in the middle, and I'll be the one doing the hard and tiring sliding at the end.  Also! I found out that I can play Above on my dulcimer, so if they need any filler, AJ (who can play drums pretty well) and I (dulcimer) can sync the song to a CD. We might replace Mad World, our ending song, because everybody seemed iffy about that song, due to it being verrrrry depressing.  Well, the instruments I ordered are effectively destroyed in my life- i paid the guy, but then it turned out that shipping would be 900 dollars. 900 dollars is a piece of crap, it doesn't HAVE to be shipped freight- they could put the shit in a suburban with all the instruments, and make it down here in 12 hours.  /sigh.  Oh well.  Thing is, cons (failing english, not getting instrument) pretty much outweigh the pros (youth service youth service YOUTH SERVICE!11!), but i'm still happy.  EDIT: Turns out, neither AJ, Sarah or I will be able to do the youth service.  Luckily, we did have a good substitute, the Blue Man Group. I hope they know how to do this stuff.

      Snider: ::checks blue man boards:: Mr. Witter: Did you see them when they came to dallas? Snider: [bewildered because he caught me not doing my work] Uhh.. yeah. Which time are you talking about, August or November? W: August. S: The 12th or 13th? W: uhhhh... 12th S: Oh, I was there too. Did you get good seats? Ours were horrible. W: We had pretty good seats. What are you reading? S: The founders made a post about their music technology they used during their rock tour. W: Yeah, they use a lot more rock than they used to... S: Yeah, they seem to be changing a lot more lately- they took things from their rock tour and put it into their original show, and we're not sure how we feel about that. W: Well, I'm glad that you like them- I have a newfound respect for you. ::walks away:: S: Uhh... thanks...  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  Here's an interesting conversation I had with a wigger yesterday...  I got on the bus to get home, and this dood was sitting where the bus driver told me to sit, so I sat next to him.  Wigger: Could you scoot out a bit? I have this... situ-A-tion where my knee... uhh... locks up... when i put it up against stuff. Snider: Agh, fine, i'll move out as soon as people stop piling on the bus. Wigger: Thank you sir, that would be much appreciative. Snider: do you know what Appreciative means? You shoulda said Appreciated. Wigger: Yeah, i know!  ::silence for 2 minutes::  Wigger: What's your problem, man? Snider: WHat?! Wigger: Why are you being such a bitch? Snider: How am I being a bitch?  (he starts making up words here)  Wigger: you got pissed off when i said appreciative. You walk over here and get into my spectrum. You can't just go around and get into the moogle of my appreciativeness factor while being such a bitch all the time! It makes me feel like I don't have any sofretes spectrum!  Snider: .....  [bus stops and I get up to get off]  Snider: Type up what you just said for me and give it to me tomorrow.  Wigger: Allright, just, next time, dont get into my spectrum.  Snider: Got it.  Un-fucking-believable.

      The Blue Man character is not an alien. He looks different on the outside, that’s for sure, but the key to the Blue Man is his inner life. The people who really connect with the Blue Man see past his unusual appearance and see something fundamentally human. Unlike the Blue Man, most of us are comfortable with pretense, we tend to our egos and our personas. We feel awkward in the presence of the primal, self-conscious in moments of playfulness and we routinely feel alone in crowds. The Blue Man is the opposite. He is naturally authentic, he is egoless, he is at home in the primal, he is never self-conscious and he easily connects with others.  What does it say about the human condition that someone with these traits seems so alien to us? Clearly, in the process of becoming “civilized” something has been lost. It’s so far gone that when it stares us in the eyes, we don’t even recognize it, and it seems strange.  There’s a part of us that instinctively knows we are not our masks, our outer shells. This part of us knows exactly who the Blue Man is. For some people it may be too far down to access; they get so far in they can’t get out. These people do not recognize the Blue Man, but there are others who haven’t completely buried this aspect of themselves. These are the people who “get” the Blue Man. When they see him, his essence is not at all alien; it is familiar, like a voice from the distant past. In this moment of recognition, it all becomes clear; we are the ones who have become the aliens" (Character Statement).  -Blue Man Group Founders

      i haven't written since.... the 4th? Woah. Now it's the 9th. That means it's been 3 days. I know, I'm so good at math.  First, Let me show you something that happened on the Blue Man boards just now...  In the new Blue Man Album, they have these "rock concert movements," but in the list, they skipped 5 to confuse everyone, and this kid thinks that just because they skipped to 6, it's a devil reference.  quote: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Originally posted by DarkMeasures: I don't know but I think BMG already has devil references in "What is Rock". Otherwise the yelling rock concert movement would have been 5... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm sorry darkmeasures- i hate to do this- oh wait, i don't- if you seriously believe that, I don't respect your opinion anymore. Simple as that.  Oh, and if anybody sides with him, yeah... no more opinion respecting for you.  Just remember- I'm not the one being unfair here. if i had it my way, if someone who won an Oscar has to be played off the stage, they would lose their award.  "Oh, you gonna force us to get you off the stage? No more golden man for you."    So dreadfully true. This kid either is so "rebellious" that he will only listen to music if it has some kind of deeper meaning that would piss his parents off, or else he's some dork whose parents teach him that anything even resembling anything written by anybody that even remotely looks like something the devil pooped out, is wrong and should be killed.     SteelxXxDragonX: remember those TATU girls? ShuChoMouff: Remember[what?]... they were around BEFORE nickelodeon whored them? SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: what did u think of them? ShuChoMouff: well, they make out on stage ShuChoMouff: ... SteelxXxDragonX: ya ShuChoMouff: they MAKE OUT on STAGE SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: so im guessing you like them? ShuChoMouff: they... MAKE OUT... on STAGE SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: they do more then MAKE OUT on stage ShuChoMouff: i know SteelxXxDragonX: wet t-shirt contest!! lol ShuChoMouff: i havent ever heard their music- noone ever plays their music, all you ever see is them making out on stage SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: they have a few good songs ShuChoMouff: oh em eff gee ShuChoMouff: clownstaples  The conversation just went downhill from there.      I sawed Hellboy. It was fairly badass.   You know those people who got pissed because it didn't follow the comic book? Were you one of them? Fuck you, you're stupid.   It didn't follow the comicbook because the movie was set in the REAL WORLD where the comic book was based on a real thing. Did you dumbasses even watch the movie? He HELD the comic book and said "I hate that comic book. They never got the eyes right." Fuckers.  But yeah, that girl had the coolest superpower ever. She was like friction-woman. When she got angry/excited(more than 1 way), she CAUGHT ON FIRE. Not that regular pussy yellow fire either, this was the blue hardcore shit.  She blew up an insane asylum, and I bet she killed a bunch of insane people with it, so she gets kudos for that. 150 less insane people to deal with.  Hmm... what else.  South Park and Chapelle's show were both insane. Holy shit. I'm not even going to explain it. Just that Wayne Brady... I didn't know he had it in him :-O  I'll talk about other shizzle tomato. Good night. (morning, whatever.)

      This may sound crazy, but you'd have to be with me...  ShuChoMouff: i keep listening to this one edited version of PVC IV(blue man) ShuChoMouff: with all the instruments removed besides the PVC instrument ShuChoMouff: this one part of the song ShuChoMouff: its amazing- it lasts like 3 seconds, but it's like its saying something Elf004: the PVC is talking ShuChoMouff: in a way ShuChoMouff: i think its message ShuChoMouff: was showing you how beautiful the world can sometimes be ShuChoMouff: even only for a moment ShuChoMouff: and you have to dig for it(i didnt have this revelation in the original unedited song)  EDIT: Nicholas's addition  "Elf004: and they show the beauty though PVC ShuChoMouff: well, that's a very blunt way to put it ShuChoMouff: you'd have to hear it Elf004: im sure i would  i wanted them to see my point question and answer, but i still dont get how beauty is expressed though PVC, but i think i get your point, just not the arrival at it... yeah"  Dood, while you were at my house, you shoulda told me to show you the thing I was talking about :-P

      I got sick of that picture farking over my HTML, so you can find it at moby.com... somewheres.  What's been going on with me lately? I've been updating my xanga more than I have this, but mostly because I get more exposure with that than I do this one- I'm going to keep this one for rants that my "inner circle" of readers always gets to. I'm not sure who that is anymore...  This is a bit of a call to anybody that reads this- post in the comments your name or screen name. I need to know if this journal is worth updating.

      This is a repost so the comments work again.  Post a memory of me in the comments. It can be anything you want.   Then - post this to your journal and see what people remember about you.   It could be any type of memory. Good or bad... (Post anonymously and see if i can figure out who it is if you want X-P)  i dare you to come up with something really good or embarrassing.

      Ohh, yeah... that feels good, new skin. I've been needing a hip new change. Easier to read, too.  What's been happening lately... i guess I'll go from the present backwards as I read things in my mind, that's how things usually go anyway.  I bought a drum! I've been looking for a floor tom or something to use for paint drumming, and I finally found one on ebay for cheep! I'll buy the other one some time in the future.  We did our youth service, but everybody hated it. Not the blue men though, everybody loved them.  My blue man party is just under 2 weeks away.  My computer has been "broken" the past week, but I finally fixed it- the problem was that the CPU fan was being a lazy bastard and forcing me to give it a jump start, much like spinning those old airplane propellors to get them going. It's running fine now, I'm just not looking forward to putting in my new one tomorrow. By far, my least favorite part of computer maintenance.  Also! I found out that I'm the only person in my school qualified to do a Lil Jon impression. I'm the only person who can yell a convincing "Whhhhhaaaat?!" and make people think that either Dave Chappelle or Lil jon are in the room.  The problem is that people don't get that gurgle in the back of their throat(or their voices just suck entirely, and they get neither the pitch or the tone or the volume right(you don't have to scream it at the top of your lungs)). I always explain this to people, and they say "shut up, no you don't" and I always reply with a hearty "Whhhhhaaaat?!" which shuts them up for at LEAST 5 seconds. Which is amazing, considering some of the gabby fuckers at my school.  Speaking of people I hate, I haven't made Welch's life miserable yet. She's our english teacher, and the spawn of Ms. Garling(our old english teacher from freshman year, who is in turn the spawn of all evil). Fucking gorilla, she didn't deserve to win Teacher of the year.  Another topic, BYRON NELSON! Mother fuckers!11 !!! THEY SHOUDL ALL BEEE KILLED WIFTH A KNIPFE!!! Or by a good meteor shower. You don't understand how pissed this makes me- there's this mother fucker that parks his car on our street, and the law doesn't allow us to bash it with a crowbar! MOTHER FUCKEER!!1111111111111q11 he should be shot.

      My communist friends pressured me into getting a xanga. So, now I have one.  I want to use both of these, but I don't want to repost the same things.  Oh, here we go- a little something before I goto school for the day:  Someone posted on the blue man forums about a drumset being used by Buddy Rich being sold on ebay for $25,000. Me and this other dood were like "That's bullcrap, give me 25,000 and i'll show you what a REAL drumset looks like (and you could probably get 20k back on the offer!)!  Here's a succession of posts that made me laugh:  ShuChoMouff: I'm with AJ- It's like spending 5000 dollars on a dime that fell out of Leonard Nemoy's pocket at the mall.  Still useable, but not worth what people are putting into it.  I could go out and buy a way better drumset for less than 25 grand.  Ztorgo: OMG, Leonard Nimoy dime for only $5000? I'll take a dozen!  ShuChoMouff: I say that because i already bought 30 :-O

      iiiiiii was a blue man sunday. X-P wooooo!!!!!  We played drumbone... and above... and... and... and... the computer. Not really.  We played 2 shows... the second of which got far better audience applause than the first. Although... the first had some better parts in the performance, though I'm not saying what they are, you'll have to ask me about that (and why i'm not saying them here).  Chadwina (from the blue man boards) showed up, and she was my guinea pig for the second service, though you can't see it in the video... *sigh*  Oh well.  During the first show, my bald cap cracked, showing that I was a white dood underneath, so I just had to do some impromptu fixin'.  We still seem to have enough blue paint left to do another 3 blue men, which is good. Keith wants me to sell it to him, but I think i'll keep it :) unless... he gives me a REALLY good offer for used greasepaint :-O  I'd... uhh.. like to thank wal-mart for having black sweatpants and shoes during the summer... and... uhh... the sun for sucking ass because its so hot(sarcasm). I'm serious- it was fairly cold outside that day, but I couldn't feel it because of the paint- you just felt the sun's rays going straight into you (much like when you're in an airplane, over the clouds, and the sun is hitting you directly from the window)  "HEHLLO!!! I ARM TEH SUN!!!!11!! WHAT IS YURO  NAM!#!!EE!!!!"  "Fuck you, sun! Owwwww!"  Then... we went to bennigans, where we had a waitress that had a striking resemblance to Drew Barrymore. Bossy, too. Apparentally "The Customer is always right" is unstylish at such a high class place as Bennigans :-P  She was cool though, that was a refreshing change.  Speaking of refreshing, that was probably the most fun at lunch i'd ever had, ever. Nicholas felt the same way.  Heh, my face hurted from taking the makeup off until Monday. Major removal and cloth scraping took place...  The fabric dye on my hands won't come off till... my estimate is Friday. I bet it won't be totally gone until the next monday, when i had mehron on my hands, it took 3 days for it all to get out of my fingernails. And this stuff is the junk you put on Easter Eggs. :-O  But... the scars i had from cat scratches are all blue now X-P  Hmm.. .what else has happened since my major lack of posting occured...  Oh yes, TAKS week. Fucking stupid. Science... when did we learn this stuff? I could have sworn to the non-existant higher power that teachers were supposed to be preparing us for this bullshit. And, when it gets here, if we bomb this information we were never taught, we get fucking remedial classes.  All the smart kids everybody hates (not the nerds, just the ones that are smart to the point that they suck) kept saying "It's common sense!" and I kept saying "The covalent bond of H2Ch3O-fucking-7 ---> 2390rifjsjew388ejddn put into the core of a nucleus at an atom-raping facility is NOT common sense!"  That's all I'm gonna write for tonight, folks. I'm too tired.  G'nite!

      The following are excerpts from things I said during a conversation with the guy that helped me realize I need to keep this thing going(in paragraph-ish form).  I think I've just ruined my relationship with about everyone at my church besides Dustin.  I got sick and tired of them always pressuring us to goto rallies(which is a 3-day lockin with pretty much no sleep(or if there is sleep, it's on an uncomfortable floor in a very noisy hall with people walking by all night))  Eric: "Okay, 3 day lockins are only cool like once a year" Me: "And with the kinds of people I don't usually hang out with, yeah"  You know the kinds of people that are so open-minded that they just loop back around to being closed-minded? Yeah, those are the kinds of people that go to those things.  Okay, so I'm angry at this point because they never just ask once, they send out separate emails about each group of rallies that are going to happen several months to a year from now. And, with each rally description, they make sure to mention how "fun" and how much of "a blast" they're gonna be, and how none of have any excuse to not goto the Halloween rally(except that the halloween rally is on a sunday, and I don't want to waste the only night my parents allow me to run around the streets at 11:00 at night wearing stupid costumes). This last one made me lose it.  Lotsa stuff was going through my head at this point- "Do they just not care that we have lives outside this church?" "We'll have homework at this point!" "WTFLMAOBBQ~!!11:LlOLolollLolOOL" "KHAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!!!!" **  You know how, in movies, a group will get together to go do something brave, like fight a bully, but when the leader of the group goes to challenge the big kid shaving his armpits in an elementary school bathroom, the rest of the group ditches him leaving him with his fists cocked- a David and Goliath situation where Goliath had a helmet on.  I never had that group. I'd sure like to wish i did, though. I did have a group. It was the gang from Mystery Science Theater 3000, because that was what was playing on my computer at the time. ****  I sent out an e-mail telling them basically to shut up, but in my own words(which, if this blog post is any indication, meant it was quite lengthy), detailing what I thought was wrong in this particular situation, and why.'  I went to sleep, cringing at the fact that this was going to leave quite a block of e-mails in my inbox.  It was just Nicholas and I for a while, flinging accusations and arguements at eachother, then Dustin replied(he seemed to be on the side of the people who were sick of hearing all this advertising), then Cheryl joined the fray, the new high-school graduate of the group, one of the two "senior" members of the class that still came. She got REALLLY pissed, and actually came out and called me an asshole, right after a quick "fuck you."  You'd think I would be offended, but actually I couldn't have been more pleased. You see, she is one of the only people I've ever met to cut the crap and tell me what she was REALLY thinking.  I left some comments back. I told them how christian churches have rallies(which they didnt know, i guess they REALLY like to hide the fact that Unitarian Universalists have obvious christian roots). I pointed out how they copied off the christians and called themselves original. Someone said "Well, if that's true, ours are more fun." To which I replied "Have you ever BEEN to a christian rally? Because I'm sure 10 minutes ago you didn't know they existed!"  Eric: "yeah thye all think they're better than anybody else, that's part of why I hate churches."  So now that I've realized that not even some of the most "open-minded" people I know have decided that opinions other than theirs are bad and that my views are "poison"(that's an actual quote there), I'm seriously considering   leaving Horizon Unitarian Universalist Church.    I was already having some problems with the actual "government" of the church, we still haven't resolved the conflict from when everybody overreacted to our church service the Youth did. For those of you who don't know about this part of the story, The minister was being a bit of a pansy when it came to talk about it, he was VERY reluctant to make a date where we can talk to him about everything he thought was wrong(all the reasons he gave were kind of dumb, besides 2). When we FINALLY got a date together, the night of the ACTUAL NIGHT where we were supposed to talk to him(which was put(purposely I realize now) on 6:00 of a Tuesday School night. When 4:00 rolled around, Someone sent out an e-mail to the youth that the date had been cancelled due to "lack of interest." BULLSHIT! ALL the class was attending! He just didn't want to talk about it!  That made Sarah and I REALLY angry. We didn't end up doing much, but boy did we make some damn good arguements, and we're gonna get this thing resolved, no matter how long it takes.  But now that I see that the problem has gotten so PERSONAL, I'm honestly considering leaving the church forever. I thought before this that, if the adults didnt interfere, I could still stay, because I have a bunch of friends here. I felt safe. I felt "in."  But now I know that opinions aren't accepted anymore. Anywhere. Sure, they're gonna read this and tell me to "stop taking this so seriously" and "we were just joking" and "come back, please!" when there IS nothing to take lightly in this situation- it DOESN'T MATTER HOW you say it, it's WHAT you say- and I'll only come back if I have some sort of guarantee that we'll all be respected for our opinions, no matter what it is(unless it hurts someone, or for other obvious reasons(i say this because otherwise someone would use that as an arguement against me)). Or, an apology.  Since they seem to love chatting over e-mail so much, I think they can do a couple more weeks without me while they sort these things out amongst themselves.  ---  I was looking up the word Faith in the dictionary earlier.  Me: Dogma was wrong Me: (the movie) Me: did you see it? Eric: It's a movie? Me: ... Eric: What's the definition of faith? Me: "Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing." Me: now, someone says in Dogma, "It doesn't matter, what you have faith in, its just whether you HAVE faith" Me: which is impossible Me: you have to have faith in something, or else the complete premise of faith is completely useless  Eric: that's more of a politically correct idea of faith Eric: ya know, the "all paths lead to heaven"  Me: here's another one: Me: "Loyalty to a person or thing; allegiance: keeping faith with one's supporters." Me: still implies that it's faith IN something Me: "The theological virtue defined as secure belief in God and a trusting acceptance of God's will." Me: IN god  Eric: yeah  ---  Me: Never mind, I'm starting my blog back up- this stuff needs to be said(same conversation as the earlier ones) Eric: damn right it does- that's why I liked your blog, it was the only one that actually said stuff that meant something. Eric: your blog is like a voice of reason for us Me: who is "us" though? Me: you, dustin, and *maybe* 2 people i know from flower mound Eric: its a small group Eric: but it's a group none-the-less  Damn right it is.  **-edited because Dustin would have wanted it that way ****- I was about to elaborate on this, but then I decided I would sound too much like an aging NPR talkshow host reading a story noone cares about

      I was wrong. Things need to be said.  "a different point of view" entry production will start shortly.

      It's been over a year now since I made this webjournal, and looking over it, I see now as a good time to end it.  It's not that I'm lazy, far from it, I got tired of hoping someone would read it and start a conversation with me about it, which never happened on a non shallow/meaningless small-talk scale.  I realized that noone took the time to read this every day, that I made noone's day brighter towards the end.  Sure, I got a few compliments, but not enough to keep my hopes up.  I guess a glimpse into some stupid kid's life is not what society wants to see.  So, for now, I'll be going on with my normal life. If you want to know about my day, talk to me. I'll sure tell you a story, maybe not something hugely amusing, but something.  Maybe someday I'll feel it necessary to exploit the daily thoughts and activitie of my life on the internet for public viewing pleasure. But, who knows when that day will be.  Farewell.
