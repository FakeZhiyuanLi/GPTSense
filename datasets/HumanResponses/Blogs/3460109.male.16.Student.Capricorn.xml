      I don't know what to do now. Days seem to get weirder and weirder for me.  I keep gettin girls asking me out, i keep getting girls trying to flirt with me, and i keep getting girls wanting to know if i'm single or not.   NO NO NO NO  i don't need this.   i'm doing fine with my girlfriend, and i don't want other people ruining it for me. I don't care what other people think, as long as i'm happy and my girlfriend is i couldn't care much for anything else, I'll end up loosing friends over this, but can't people just leave me be? it's not like i'm a fucking superstar or anything like that is it? i'm just a normal, everyday guy that happens to be in love.   Another thing that it getting on my nerves too...Townies. I'll be walking down the road and suddenly some idiot will shout (usually from a car thats moving) "GOFF!!!" they don't have the balls to say it to my face.  I fucking hate townies, they judge people like me to be 'goffik wrist-slitting satan worshippers'  a. i'm not even a goth.  b. my wrists are unscarred. c. i don't have any religion, but i was born a christian.  They think this just because i wear black alot.  So?... do i go round calling them 'idiotic cheap cider drinking pathetic wastes of time'? i don't, but i fucking should do, But you do get some townies that can be good friends, i have about 20 townies friends, but i have about 35 friends that are into metal, it s an underground war. They fight over music they prefer and what the dress in, and i'm on the sidelines.  Damon Pollard- "Goff's like you are scrubbers and can't afford anything"  Ahem, excuse me, but arn't the boots what real goths wear supposed to be around 200 pounds? yeah, thats cheap and really scrubbish isn't it, fuck i'd rather pay that for boots than pay 100 quid for a fucking cap.   Neil Whittaker- "All you goffs are gayboys who are all on the dole"  Err Neil, you need a fucking slap. You'll find most 'goffs' get the pretty girls, and townies are lef with skank that has STD's, only a minority of them are actually gay or bisexual. Most real goth's are on the dole? (work benefit) i've spoke to goths that are 30+ years old and they've got real carrears like doctors and veterans, not shitty garage jobs, or stuck in the army..yes Neil, i know what you've planned. and you Damon, you pair of failures, Damon is headed for the Infantry where there is supposed to be 'loads of different options for him' he'll be patrolling germany for 5 years then he'll be stuck in Iraq, wow, i bet he'll love that, he might get a plastic medal IF he returns, he's already failed the tests once, and he'll keep failing. Neil on the other hand said he wants to stick his nose in lanky damons ass and join aswell...he's too fat, so NOW he wants to work in a butchers and then mover onto plumbing. the butcher part suits him perfectly, he'll be drooling everyday over the enormous amounts of meat and when no ones looking he'll swipe some.   Honestly. you two better look in the mirror, slap yourselves and think of what you are. You're a pair of failed lab experiments.  So anyways. Things thjat are happening untill the weekend that are ultra important are;  Friday- English Lit Exam.  In this exam i have to compare 4 poems,  1 Gillian clarke 1 Sheamus Heaney 2 Pre-1914 poems.  i'm not sure how this exam is gonna go down, it could be ultra hard or easy, or both, we'll have to see  That'll be all for now.  Apart from one thing. i set up a website. Check it out sometime.   http://theunendingwrathofash.itgo.com/  -Curly

      I've decided to take up a blog, so i can keep track of things that have happened, so i don't forget them.   so yeah, since this is my first post i'll start with what is currently happening in my daily life. I'm 16 years of age and i'm currently revising for exams i have left so i can go onto either a Modern Appenticeship (electrician) or further education at college (Music)  the G.C.S.E's i have taken are; English English Literature Maths Science (double award) History Information Technology Drama Resistant Materials (Craft Technology)  the exams i'm due to take(or taken already are;  Tue 11 May- Drama (all day exam) *DONE* Mon 25 May (afternoon)- Information Technology (full/short course- 1hr 45mins) *DONE* Tue 26 May (morning)- Science (modules- 60 mins) *DONE* Fri 28 May (morning)- English Literature (1hr 45 mins) Mon 7 June (afternoon)- Science (singe and double award- 1hr 30mins) Tue 8 June (afternoon)- Maths (2hrs) Wed 9 June (afternoon)- Resistant Materials (1hr 30 mins) Thur 10 June(morning)- English (1hr 45mins) Mon 14 June (morning)- Science (double award 1hr 30mins) Mon 14 June (afternoon)- English (1hr 30mins) Tue 15 June (morning)- Maths (2hrs) Tue 15 June (afternoon)- History (2hrs) Wed 23 June (morning)- History (1hr 45mins)  after this i am free for 11 weeks. so i'm taking up a summer job untill college. in the spare time i have in the holidays, i am going to different parts of the Uk, just to see places. I am also saving up to go to New York in November with my sister, we'll save a hell of alot of money because we don't have to go in a hotel. we'll be staying at a very very very good friends house (thanks to Cayla not just for letting me stay at her house in November, but for putting up with me for so long! :-p )  things i do in my spare time consist of;  Playing Bass Listening to Music (mainly death and black metal. bands like Ulver and Mithras) Watching Tv Playing Tetris on Bladestorm ( http://forums.bladestorm.net ) Talking to people (mainly people that are downtown or on AIM or MSN) Playing NFL Hitz 2003 on Ps2(as well as other games like FFX)  At the moment i don't seem to be having the best of lives, random things just seem to happen and i get blame, i don't just sit there and take it though.  it also gets on my nerves when people 'make fun' of me because my my hair, people like that are stupid, and need a slap, Like one time, i was walking home alone from a nice drink at the pub, and as i got to my street, 4 guys started attacking me, they knocked me down from behind (typical) and they were trying to take my wallet and my phone. and as someone shouted (a guy i'd never met before, but he's a friend now) 'Oi, what the fuck are you playing at?' they ran off like scolded hounds. It's pathetic, honestly. I didn't really bother to try and avenge them, but other people did, 2 of them are now in prison, one is in hospital(i think he's out now), and the other moved down south, weird eh? i didn't even ask for anything to happen.    well. i think i'll leave it at that for now.   -Curly
