      Hey, how's this lyric?  Artist: Franz Ferdinand  Album: Franz Ferdinand  Title: Take Me Out    So if you're lonely  You know I'm here waiting for you  I'm just a crosshair  I'm just a shot away from you  And if you leave here  You leave me broken, shattered, I lie  I'm just a crosshair  I'm just a shot, then we can die   I know I won't be leaving here with you    Hmm, i think that is quite thoughtful. I do think about such a thing a lot... Wow, there's only ONE WEEK left of summer! in exactly 9 days and 8 hours, i'm going to be at school. About to start class. WTF??? where is my summer??? I want a refund! Well, at least another two months. August is always kickin. Man, marshmellow fights are so cool... A longer barrel really is key to accuracy. Man, i'm like pro at jugular shots now. Just ask gnat. But who am i supposed to get in fights with now? everyone is leaving... My group that i have grown to feel so at home in is mostly leaving. What am i supposed to do now, talk to people in my grade? man, i've never done that... I'm scared...  I just remembered that i forgot my old best freind's birthday. For like the 4th year in a row. whoops. August 16th... i can always remember it at any point in the year, but not on a week in either side of it. I'll have to call him tomorrow. Wow, he can legally drink in canada now... maybe we'll have to go on a road trip... There's probably something i have to say about love and life and liberty... but i'm too content to think of words for it. So i'll just save it. Goodbye. I love all of you, unless you're a guy. That would be just weird.

      Ok, just go and read Erin's blog for today. (8/19/04). Yeah, the one that starts with "belch". I can't add anything to that. I agree so much... Ohh, and i picked out the music for the fight scenes for my movie! I might not have time for all of them, but i have some excellent selections to pick from... Bodies from Drowning Pool, When worlds Collide from PM 5K, How i could just kill a man by Rage, Immagrant Song from Zeppelin, and Stick 'Em Up by Quarashi. That's what i have to work with now. I'm about to look through my recently aquired Beach Boys music for the suspense scene, or i might do some choral. I'm not sure... I haven't picked that yet. And i think it still might need two songs for the coffe shop scene. I have no idea what i will use for that. And the special effects are coming nicely. Quite sweetly, actually, if i do say so myself. Right now i'm doing some mid-editing rendering, yeah, i know, it sucks. There are a few things i hate about pinnacle.  I just wrote a whole paragraph, but i deleted it. It sounded too insecure. But, why is it that i feel completely different around girls in my group of friends that just graduated (and amanda and the others that didn't), then girls in general. I'm completely different around them. I'm lively and animated with the one group, but i'm very cool and collected and calm around the other. Why is that?  One more thing i thought of tonight. They say, "Make the best of every moment." Well, it's true. I was angry because i had to do hard work tomorrow, and i have been all week, and i'm tired of it. And i was down. But, tomorrow's not here yet. Why can't i have fun now? Most haven't left for college yet, why not have fun now? Etc, etc, etc. It's like one of my favorite quotes, from Vanilla Sky: "Every passing moment is another chance to turn it all around." If all you do is look gloomily towards tomorrow, then nothing will ever come of today. So why not have fun now? Oh yeah, it's because i'm still broke. Dang.  Goodnight. Have fun.

      Today was alright... aside from splitting and hauling and throwing firewood for most of it (and yesterday, and tomorrow), it was alright. It appears that our movie is going to be a great hit--I have even heard a remark that it would top Sombrero. Wow, that's an honor. I think this will be my claim to fame as this town's cinematographer... I love hugs. Wow, i really do. I never used to get any... but now, my luck is changing. Too bad that 99% of my hug-givers are all leaving in a week. Which brings me to the topic... Man, the end starts now. Jess leaves today, and everyone else follows. I have no idea what to expect from school next year... nothing at all will be the same. Many of my friends are going to college within a week or so. Then, you have to add the new schedule, integration, and many many other things. I have no idea what to expect... In a slight way, it scares me a little. Wow, then i remember that i get to start playing God. Cool. Hey, no one else gets this title for the next 2 years! It's all mine. hmhmmm... sweet. Everything is playing into my hands, exactly like i wanted it to... It's like my life is a dollhouse. Yes. A dollhouse. Dang, i might just turn Taoist yet. Everything i wanted as a freshmen, well, it's playing out right in front of me. How cool is that? I have controlled my destiny. That is why i don't belive in destiny. I have controlled it myself. I thought of something else today, too... I can only remember two presidential elections, but i remember in '96, i wanted clinton to win, because he was doing a good job, and Dole kind of scared me, and he was named after a fruit company. Well, clinton won. In 2000, i really wanted Gore to win the popular, but Bush to win the electoral and thus the office. Well, both came true. I'm thinking... am i on a roll? Well, as of right now, i want Kerry to win. I may change my mind, after all, i do have 2 months left, but for now, it's Kerry. Let's see how he does. If he wins, i'll be convinced. I should try horse-racing. sweet. Man, i've bored anyone reading this by now. I want another hug. Goodbye.

      I have found something. Happy blogs are starting to annoy me. I mean, like if you're happy, and i'm sad, i will just feel worse by reading a happy blog. And i'm usually pretty sad. So, i think i'm just going to give up reading some of them... I think i've found something. For those of you who know me, i have a huge fear of failure. I also have a huge hate of second-guessing. But what i fear and hate the most, is being outside of the circle. When i'm not in... well, i just feel out. It is so bad... Like today... i was trying to call someone, because i was bored... and of about 20 people i called, 19 were not answering. 1 was about to leave. I instinctively think: are they doing something, and i don't know about it??? Because i do feel really bad when i am left out. And it's not blaming anyone, and it's not telling anyone off, i'm just saying... i overreact. It's not my fault, it's just instinctive for me. When don't know about stuff, i just get the vibe that i wasn't supposed to know about it. Like, that someone didn't want me to know about it. I'm so self-interrogative, i have no idea about my standing in people around me. I have no idea what other people think about me. But it just makes me feel bad. I don't want to be appeased, either... that's even worse. man... And, it is possible to buy your friends. But, it is risky. two things might happen in the process: either you might not have the opporitunity to buy them anymore, or they might stop wanting it. Either of witch will leave someone feeling terrible. That so happened to me. Another thing... My car is starting to make a noise... it sounds like the brakes are scraping a little. When i depress the brake pedal, it goes away, but sometimes it comes back. That, and sometimes, when i go really fast, there's a little thing right behind the left rear wheel with some hoses coming out of it, that makes a loud hum (it's an A flat...) and if you bend the bracket that the thing is on up a little, it will go away, but when you let it down again, it will start again. I don't know what makes it do this stuff... i'm just a humble musician.  Man, no one is online tonight, and no one was at the fair, and there were two parties going on, but i couldn't go to either because i didn't know the hosts... this kind of sucks. I'm leaving.

      Hey charlie... you don't have to write the time you post it anymore! i fixed it for you. Man, i have no laptop this weekend, so i have to only blog when i have time to downstairs... Well, friday was fun... I went to school to get my schedule, and i saw peterson there... i guess i'm his buddy now. I think that's a cool thing...   i went to the dance at the fair, that was... well, a dance. Then we walked back to the kbob with some people... i drove on a curb... Then we went to erin's and me and jared started randomly making food. We made an excellent quasedilla. It was so good.  Yesterday wasn't bad, either. My dad got a new tv. the old one wasn't working anymore, but now we have a new one. 34" widescreen HD... it's sweet. Then i went to the fair, but there wasn't anyone there to hang out with... so me and mike went to andy's party... and had fun... It was funny, after a while we went back to the fair, and i got out of my car, and i ran right into the side of a truck. I didn't even see it there. Then we went back to andy's, but i had to leave right away.  Another reason i left the fair, is because i felt lonely and denied at the dance. Well, i guess that's every dance i go to. Huh. You know those things where they ask you one phrase to describe yourself, well, i found mine.  "Hey, I'm open Saturday night..."  man... that sucks... well, now i have to go clean my room. Goodbye.

      wow... i can say no more, nothing. Tongight, i was driving through zimmerman, and something struck me. I know why i can't remember my life before 8th grade! IT is because: Ok, i have always lived in the same house. But, my residency has changed. I always lived in princeton, and shopped in princeton, and i went to school in crown, a town of 5 people halfway between zimmerman and st. francis, in the st. francis school district. But i know why i can't remember! My life was in zimmerman! I haven't gone through zimmerman for three of four years! and that is why i don't remember my life. i haven't seen it. I can not tell you about what what emotion was running through my body. But during the drive, i remember thinking a few things... First, i remember looking at Peeper's house. Peepers, for all of you who do not know him, was a guy named David Austin, who would now be a senior. He was an interesting cherichter. He started off well. But the zimmerman city life corrupted him. He started in with some "loose" girls, and then with drugs... He was arrested for possetion at the age of 14 and sent to Lino. Well, things went downward from there. He was completely corrupted, and i have not talked with him for four years now, at least. I'm not sure that i would want to... but he used to be one of my best freinds. And he has just drifted off. I went by my freind Corey's house. He was a shrimp. I saw his brother in the garage with a basketball... I wonder how he is doing now... I went by my freind Tena's house. I think, that we might have become quite good friends. Our interests are quite similar now to how i remember them. I went through the woodlands, and remembered when we went trickortreating there... where we were scared by a kid with a capgun... and where we met up with david, and he said he would be right back. He went off to smoke pot, and he never came back. Angry, me and my freind went into his treehouse, and doused it with grape juice, and stole his playboys. wow. I was thinking... is this what it comes down to? I leave a community, and i never see those people again? Lots of my freinds are leaving for college now... some in less than a week! Is this it? Will i never see 50% of them, ever again? THAT SO SUCKS! I remember looking at all the houses, thinking of how they all look like they live nice lives... I hope all of my freinds do that. They'd better have nice lives. I will never see some of them again... I hope i have one, too... I hope i can deal with loss... dammit. I can't. Why does this happen?

      IT CAME today!!! I'm so excited. (The hassler cd i ordered, in case you didn't get that) Wow, it's really good. I was reading the liner notes, though... and even though it's in english, i literally can't understand half of the words used. i.e., the title... but it is really good. I do enjoy it so. Today was oh so cold... at 5, i started mowing my church like i do every other week... think of it... two and a half hours on a lawn mower in a field. Wow, that was cold. I must have really looked like an idiot out there in my big winter coat and my hat that looks like it came from the movie fargo... except bigger. haha. wow. A realization hit me today. I think i'm finally starting to realize that i am the tech lead. I mean, i knew it before... but i think it's really starting to hit me... I mean, i will have to do stuff. Wow. And no one esle knows how. (or has the keys...) Another realization hit me today, too. This summer has been very optomistic... but i have changed so much from may to now... i don't really know why, but i did. I think this is up there in my best summers ever... but i have changed a lot. This is the sole argument in favor of leaving... I won't look at any of the people at school the same way. Well, maybe about five... but other than that, i'll be seeing all of them in a completely different light than before... The thing is, that they will see me the same. I feel like i'm going into a new school with new people. I knew i would feel this way, and i didn't know why or how, but now it is coming true. I went to the activites meeting yesterday, and saw 300 people i haven't seen all summer... and it was just kind of weird... I feel intimidated. I feel like a complete 9er... except way worse than what i did when i was a 9er. I feel like i have to earn the approval of all of the people there... like my popularity rests on a tightrope... And i know that everyone there knows me, and i know all of them, and they have already judged me, many times, probably. But i feel like it is all not-- like i'm a newbie. Like i have control over my destiny... Wow. It really is a weird feeling, but now that i'm listening to hassler, it will get better. After all, now i'll start doing some more deep thinking... more good stuff for you to read...

      So, today was so interesting... I only did one peice of work all day! this is the first time that that has happened... i don't know, maybe ever? Also, i realized that i have like 15 days left to copy as much of other people's music as i can, before they go off to college. aww. Man, there's so much to do in the small month ahead of me. It will be gone, before i even realize it, and there will be so much unaccomplished. I have to turn in another bill for my services... i'm about broke, and now is when i need all the money i can get. I still have lots of clothes shopping, supply shopping, and the like to do... I don't know of any deep thought i can give today. I am not in the mood. I can tell you my quote of the day. This fits very well into the state i feel around me.  "Love isn't just an emotion; love is shaving your balls!"  That is from American Wedding, if you didn't already know that. I saw it for the first time today. Interesting movie.  I still haven't ruled out becoming a physicist... right now, i'm reading a book on the theory of relativity. I want to find a book on Chaos theory and Unified Field theory, and the like... And, when i said DJ earlier, i meant live dj. I could be a station dj, then it is all laid out for you. That wouldn't be all bad. Man, i'm tired. Peace out. Much love. Word. Hammer time.

      Ok, i'm having a lot of deep thoughts right now. Just remember who's got the sweet system... Anyway, I would also like to take the time to say that my deep thinking may have been caused by a few people, but are never pointed at anyone, unless i tell you they are. So, if you read this and think it's about you, well, it probably isn't, even if you got me thinking it. I am a very dynamic guy, and i hate being second-guessed... Anyway, I thought about something else. Mr. Kristo gave me the breif introduction to this thought in 9er english, but i have been seeing the truth to it very much recently. Assertion is a necessary element of life. No, this dosen't mean it's alright to beat your wife, or kill a guy who made you angry. That is not what i mean by assertion. But it is something that i do not posess. Even Peterson himself essentially told me I was a pussy last week. And coming from Peterson... My goal is to become more assertive, irrigardless of the risk. No gain without risk, right?  I know that some of the things I say are hard to understand. Like the nothing new thing, i know that you don't understand it how i would like you to. I am just talking. Remember, you don't have to care...  Another thing i thought of, is the value of time. If there is one thing that i want to tell you for a long time, is to NEVER never ever put a worth on time. Time is the most expensive thing that you can ever have, and you didn't even pay for it. So many people take time for granted, how if they (i thought about this) would just be able to go to college now, (and skip two years...) but i say no! You have no idea how much this second is worth... just think of neurons. In one second, think of all the neurons you use, millions, i'm sure... think of all of those neurons that would never have been if you had skipped that second. Life is so so soooo short, you must treasure every moment. Yes, even this one. Through the good and bad, because when it is bad, it just makes the good so much better. Hold on to it; Never give up any time. Never do it...  By the way, Ben Folds is my hero(s) right now...

      Well, two hours later, and i have a whole "new" slate of conceptions. First, i remembered that i went to a grad party today, and i knew three people there, and they were my uncles. It was bad. Second, i rememberd that potvin got married today. Maybe he'll soften up a bit... and stop beating me... I accidentaly thought--that he was sleeping right now... HMGH! ok, new thought... Now at home, and after the party, which was disapointing, due to my performance. The party itself was great. But, i did realize a few more things.  First, in the course of the "courting" of the opposite sex, there are two ways to go about it. For example, take me and one of my friends. We are quite similair, i would like to think... after all, we do have many of the same interests and mannerisms... heck, we're only four days apart from each other in age... but the way we think about girls could not be more different. I belive that when thinking about his "relationshipal" life, no more thought has gone through his head than "oh, she's hot." Then, magically, he has started to go out with some of those girls.  With me, it is completely different. I have the trait of overanalyticalness. It is terrible. I have looked over and analyzed my situation twice as much as the pentagon looked over the plans for WWII. I have thought about it so much, that probably most of my life since Febuary 3rd, the year i was in 4th grade, has been spent thinking about it. About every instant, waking or sleeping. What is bad, is that there is little difference in quality of the two methods. Actually, i would say that the first way is a little better. That sucks. Another thing is that there is a breaking point to "bust a move". A deadline. If you step over it, there's very little chance that anything will ever amount. That sucks, too. I love you all. Goodnight. I shall go and wallow in a puddle of my own self-pity now.

      No more West Side Story, i promise.  Tonight, i have realized something. I have been waiting for this day for like two weeks, and now it is here. From the exact center of what i have been waiting for, i realized something. Well, two things. First, I could not be a good DJ. I could be a really good sound technician if i wanted to be, but not a DJ. That involves making everyone happy, and if i didn't do that, i wouldn't be able to take it.  Much more importantly, the other thought. Nothing is new. Never, and in no circumstances. Nothing is ever new. You may hear the optomistic; that every end is another new beginning. I disagree, but also i do not accept the optomistic. I will only accept that every any beginning is the result of an end. Therefore, anything thought of as "new" really isn't, but is just reincarnated or reinvented. If you think about it, "new" cars are just additions on to what was already there... (ok, now i'm about to go theological...) In the beginning was God, and the word was with god, and the word was god. (that's how i think it goes, it's pretty close) But, there is no accout of what was before god, therefore he is not new. Everything he made, his new creation, was already a concept. Therefore, it wasn't new. If you think about if someone is going for a "new" hairstyle, or a "new" concept of themselves, it was not new, but either someone else has already had it, or it is an addition of what was already there. That is not what i am using this new revelation for. Moreover, there is no -one- new. Everyone that you see, is not new. not in any way. I can not really explain this to you... It is too complicated for me to explain. It is close to one of those emotions that i can not describe. If you were me, you would see it.  But, you probably can't. I'm sure of it. Oh well, i guess i will just have to make do with what i already have. It will be harder, but it would have been whether i would have realized it or not. Whatever, i guess i'm leaving.

      There's something due any day; I will know right away, Soon as it shows...  It may come cannonballing down through the sky, Gleam in its eye, Bright as a rose!   Who knows? It's only just out of reach, Down the block, on a beach, Under a tree.  I got a feeling there's a miracle due, Gonna come true, Coming to me!   Could it be? Yes, it could. Something's coming, something good,  If I can wait!  Something's coming, I don't know what it is, But it is Gonna be great!   With a click, with a shock, Phone'll jingle, door'll knock, Open the latch!  Something's coming, don't know when, but it's soon; Catch the moon,  One-handed catch!   Around the corner, Or whistling down the river, Come on, deliver To me!  Will it be? Yes, it will. Maybe just by holding still, It'll be there!   Come on, something, come on in, don't be shy, Meet a guy, Pull up a chair!  The air is humming, And something great is coming! Who knows?  It's only just out of reach,  Down the block, on a beach,  Maybe tonight . . .   ₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪₪  I did really hate the movie when we were forced to watch it... but i'm starting to rethink that. I could not sum up what runs over me every day better...

      No, there is no real reason i am quoting West Side Story. But, i am bored. I just got back from amanda's house, I brought over and set up my sweet, sweet system. The music will be scrumtralescent at her party. If you are reading this, you'd better go. Unless you have to go to Potvin's wedding (yeah, right...) So, i am bored. I really am in the mood to disclose something... I'm still angry about the Seattle bus list. No, wait, i complain about that a lot. Everyone knows that. Umm... I feel very lonely right now. I can't wait till tomorrow... the party, but superceding that, i wish that i had someone there at the party that i could just... well, nevermind. You can guess what i was going to say. No, don't look at me. go away. no, i'm not blushing...

      Ok. I'm angry, because i already typed this once tonight. It wiped it out, so now i have to do it again.  I promised you insanity. Now, i'm going to give it to you.  I went to farmfest today, alone, just as i said that i would... which is a 130 mile drive from my place. Well, i was tired from getting up at 6 to go... well, i toughed it out, but i did feel a bit disoriented on the way down there. I would see town names, and some would stick out in my head. The thing is, that i had no idea why they stuck out. I have no idea whatsoever. I always have the idea why... why i didn't today... idk...  So when i was there, I was sitting on a bench, and i blinked. nothing special... just a blink... well, you know when you stare at the sun, or a bright light for a while, if you close your eyes, you can still see it... Well, i wasn't staring at any lights... When i blinked... I saw a picture of a woman. It was in negative polarity, as it usually is when you close your eyes and see things, but i could see the picture of the woman. I tried it again, and saw nothing. I wasn't even looking at anybody when it happend, and it certainly wasn't anyone around me. Actually, the person that it looked most like was Betsy... I have no idea why... it sounds weird, but that is because it is really, really weird. What explains something like this? I wasn't even thinking of her!  Well, on the way home, i was going up a four-lane divided highway... and i saw a navy blue Jeep Liberty. I was going faster than it, so i was passing it, and when i glanced in, i saw what looked much like Kaitlin S.'s mom, but i know it wasn't because i was told that they dont' have a jeep liberty. Nonetheless, it looked a whole lot like her. So, let's call this woman Jan. I also noted that Jan was the only one in the car. I thought nothing of it, so i just kept driving.  I kept a small eye out for the jeep, though, even though i don't know why. It started speeding up after a little bit, and started to pass me. But, when i looked in, Jan was not the person driving! (Yes, i am sure it was the same car.) Instead, it was a woman about the age of 23, and with a ponytail instead of the hair that Jan had. Nonetheless, it was the same car, same hair color, same shirt, so i pretty much passed it off that I had seen it wrong the first time. I just let it go, but i did make sure to get a good and accurate mental image this time.  About ten minutes later, my lane started to pick up a little speed, and so i went near the liberty again... and i just peered in... AND IT WAS JAN DRIVING!!! NOT THE YOUNGER WOMAN!!! I AM SURE THAT IT WAS JAN!!!  HOW does this happen???? WHY would my mind do this to me??????  So, the moral of the story, is that i can no longer trust anything that i see, hear, or do. No more. So, good night. Or, is it night? I am not sure. I have no way of knowing any more. I don't even know that i am typing this. Goodbye.

      Another Paradox. Since i have been pulled into the world of blog reading... There are two certain unnamed blogs that i read on a particular basis that appeal to me. The odd thing is, that i can uncannily agree with everything they say... but at the same time, they are completely different. One makes me feel kind of satisfied... but also a little unfulfilled. The other one makes me feel quite alone, yet a bit contented. Either way, i guess i end up feeling both ways. So, i go and binge some chocolate and do whatever else i do when i'm in that mood, and go to bed feeling unfulfilled and lonely. That is pretty much all night... and now i've just been informed that the county fair is next week. And, tomorrow, i'm going to FarmFest with my dad, which pretty much means alone. So now, i'm kind of depressed, unfulfilled, and most of all, lonely. It is not cool... Anyway, don't feel too bad for me. It is not just the blogs that make me feel like this, they just remind me of what i feel in life. You go and be happy. The end.

      Ok, i just thought i would impart you with my current mood. Here is how i described it in a conversation.  ok, pretend that you're 4 now, imagine that you're in a huge candy store. and you're delighted. So, you see this big lollipop up on the shelf. You want it more than anything in the world... you'd do anything for it. you know that with a lot of luck, you can get it. All of a sudden, a stranger picks it up and gives it to you. you are delighted! this lollipop will last you forever, it's so big! You gingerly go out of the store with it, so anxious to eat it... you're so anxious to eat it... it look so good, and you want to eat it more than anything. It will give you so much satisfaction, you could shout and scream for joy! can you see it? feel the joy?  All of a sudden, a large man of about 35 years, wearing all black, and a black mask, and carrying a handgun, runs up behind you. You do not even see him, you are so concentrated on the item you are about to aquire. The man runs up, and grabs the lollipop, and starts running away.  can you imagine the heartbreak? you sit down, and cry.  That is how i feel right now. I may not be crying. I don't cry. I work out. but that's how i feel.  But there's still the lollipop. You desire it much more than anything in the whole world. You'd do anything for the lollipop. You know that to get it this time, you will need a miracle. Nothing short of a miracle. But, you want that lollipop more than anything... so you stop crying... and you get up... and start running. And, just maybe, in the end, you know you might someday see it again. but it will take everything you have, and more luck than there is but you just keep running on that little shred of faith, that someday you might see it again.  I could not more accurately describe my present mood. Thank you for listening.

      Ok, before you read this, you MUST go and read the previous entry. I command you. Well, i remembered something today... There is only one simple way to put down the PPKs. It can even be summed up in one word. Indifference. Complete indifference. If everyone just said "screw it!" and went home and ate some cookies, everything would be fine. Everyone must no longer care about each other's actions. That is the answer. I was thinking, and I am aware of how i am not at all affected by drama. In fact, i could really care less about it. Then i rememberd: I declared my indifference in 8th grade! That is why i can tolerate drama; I don't care about it! You may call me naive... you also may say i am heartless. I deny it; instead, i would declare it a defense mechanism in action. I don't care, i don't stare down the barrel of a Walther. That simple. I was going to say something else, but i forgot what it was. I know that it was somewhat important to my point, but, oh well. screw it.    I HAVE in recent months found a deep love for the music of Hans (sometimes referred to as Johann) Leo Hassler. He is my very favorite composer of all time. You might only imagine what estaticity was flowing through my body (no, more than that, think harder) when i was at the Mall of America and found a collection of his music through the Barnes and Noble's music service. The place is great! you can browse over 200,000 cd's (like every one ever made, like Amazon.com times three) and preview all of them! And then you can have it ordered and sent to your house! it's so cool. I would reccomend it. Thank you.

      ok, i'm already breaking my intro. But, i guess i have to write a little about life; Like in the movie Vanilla Sky (GO RENT IT if you havn't already seen it) "The sweet isn't as sweet without the sour." So i figure with this page--to really create a true picture of my mental state, i will add some sanity. I guess i'm going to start out with some of it. Here goes.    I am in one of those moods right now that is undescribable. It is not undescribable happiness or despair; not at all, but instead, it is just undescribable. I feel a little contented... From talking to some of my freinds who have recently graduated (yes, a few of them) who pretty much have some large people issues currently, due to the "I'm leaving for college in less than a month" thing, because they have been near each other for too long. It happens, I can attest to that. The thing is, though, that it is like the entiere large group of friends all have identical Walther PPKs pointed at each other... their problems are all pretty much identical. It's just that they are pointed at each other. Well, this makes me contented to know that i don't have a PPK in my hand, or one pointed at my head. I still have two more years to get one of those. So, i am somewhat contented. I do feel a little screwed for not being at a party that random people were invited to at the last minute, one of my good freinds included, but not me. Thanks, powers that be. Screw you too. What i find interesting, is that even though right now i should be so mentally worked up that i should be coming up with conspiracies and mental pictures like nothing... but i feel contented right now on not imparting you with them. All i really can think of is nothing... well, a little part of me is thinking of the single semi-crush that i have had forever (no, i will never tell you who it is.) But other than that, i can't think of anything. So, good luck. Have sweet dreams. I'm signing off.

      Greetings, readers. Now having this blog for about a day, i realize that i might just spend more time editing the html of the page than writing entries for it. Oh well. I promise you that many of my entries will be entertaining, anyway.

      Well, yes, i have succombed (right word?) to the pressure, i have created my very own blog. I don't really plan on writing much, because i hate writing. But, nonetheless, i will probably end up writing novels. I mostly just plan on writing about dreams, or creations of my own mind that were dreams gone awry and happend in consiousness, or things i can think of to describe how i see my own thought. To warn you, this may at any time become uncomprehendibly confusing, or just so off the ball that you are convinced that i am crazy. Well, truthfully, after a while of living as me, even I am convinced of it. You may want to leave my blog after reading something (maybe about the government, or i had a dream about something religiously affiliated). Heck, you may want to scream and throw your computer down in disgust hoping it will never be able to bring you back. You may never want to go to kansas again, but the tornado is waiting for you. But my main reason for doing this is just so i can have the false assumption that other people are reading this... maybe they'll think i'm crazy too. So good reading.
