       Fear not, people -- Toonces found (finally) and killed the mousey downstairs.  She played with it and rolled around with it for about an hour (while I watched "I Love the 70's", 1979), and then came upstairs to receive her praise.  She's the littlest cat ever, but she's a stealth killing machine who takes no crap.        'Bout fucking time.  Damn cats.

       So, every night before bed I drop my jammie pants on the floor so I can put them on in the morning when I awaken.  This morning I went to pick them up, and in my peripheral vision, I noticed something laying on the carpet where my pants just were.  Funny, I don't remember setting these on a mouse when I went to be-HEY!  There are vermin in our house!      Toonces is my little killer -- she eats mosquitos, bugs, spiders, flies, and other assorted moving things.  I set her in front of a Daddy Long Legs one day in my bathroom, and she grabbed it with her little white paw, and CHOMP.  Can't say that wasn't disgusting, but I praised her for doing what she was supposed to do.  Now, Albert, my mom's cat, used to be an outside cat on our farm.  He is the senior mouser in the house.       Logically, I grab Toonces first, because she's lighter to carry, and I bring her downstairs.  I saw it scurry across the floor to my bag of stuffed animals, so I set her near that hoping she'd smell something or whatever it is they do.  PLOP.  She thinks it is time for the tummy rubs.  Not being able to resist her cuteness, I give her a tummy rub, and put her back over to the bag, lifting it up to reveal the mouse.  I screamed, because that was my fight-or-flight instinct apparently, and she got freaked and ran upstairs.  The mouse went under the area rug.  Fabulous.        I go upstairs, grab Albert, who is not pleased that I have disturbed his slumber, and I place him next to the edge of the area rug.  He walks over to me, rubs my leg, and PLOP -- wants a tummy rub.  What the hell, cats?  You all want to kill Dweezil (my bird), meanwhile, there are unwanted guests in the house and you need to be petted?  See if I run out to the grocery store and get cat food next time the bowl is empty.  You'll have to work for your supper.      Maybe I should try Ninja....she's the smartest.  She's my door-opener.  Toonces figured out how to shut light switches off when I lived in that very very very ghetto apartment on 9th street downtown.  Albert spent more than half his life outside.  You'd think we wouldn't have any problems here at 1038 Boyd Drive, but you thought wrong.        I'm going to go to the bank now and deposit my paycheque.  When I get home, there had better not be anything living downstairs except for Dweezil.

       I went to exchange Chad's "Monkey Bone" DVD for my scrub pants at his work tonight, and he said, "They're in my truck."  He was driving a different vehicle, and my pants were in his other truck, essentially.      Why couldn't my pants have been transported into the vehicle that is currently being utilized?  They're made of a light-weight poly-cotton.      Okay, it's cute when Mike leaves his wallet in his other pants so that I have to foot the meal bill (well, not really cute, but, for lack of a better word), but leaving my beloved scrub pants in his stinky cigarette-smoke-smelling truck?  Fabulous.  Some stranger borrowing his truck is driving around with my pants.  I feel so....icky.      Fucker.      Anyway, Chad, if you're reading this, I'm not really that mad.  I just wanted to be funny.  At your expense.  Aren't I fun?

       Do you not love the intentionally misspelled word?&nbsp; I love being me.    &nbsp;  Anyway, turns out Willie (the guy from work who looks like the wedding singer) tested negative for Whooping Cough.&nbsp; Willie, we hardly knew ye.&nbsp; May you be back assisting patients soon.&nbsp; Just don't get your contaminates all over the admitting area.    &nbsp;  Speaking of admitting, I ordered a new name tag for work that was supposed to have "admissions coordinator" on it under my name, but when my shiny new badge arrived, it only said "admitting".&nbsp; My official title is admissions coordinator, complete with it's own pay raise and prestige.&nbsp; The admitting clerks look up to me because of the deftness in which I coordinate admissions.&nbsp; How can I be a good role model for them without my proper title emblazoned on my name tag?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  *sigh*

       So, I was minding my own business last night at work, and right at the end of my shift I was approached by a man.&nbsp; It was a desperate looking guy, probably my age or so, seeking pamphlets dealing with mental retardation.&nbsp; He said it was required to have at least twenty different items for this class of his.&nbsp; I said, "Dude, I hope this class isn't tomorrow", and of course, it was for the next day.&nbsp; I wondered why he waited until the last minute, but then I remembered writing&nbsp;the final paper for Columbian Art History a few hours prior with NO research materials save for my text book.&nbsp; I failed the class, but whatever.&nbsp; The point is, all ancient pottery looks the same, and you try writing a ten-page paper on the significance of a bunch of brown pots.    &nbsp;  I'm just saying.    &nbsp;  Anyway, I didn't have any of that stuff around, and it was almost eleven at night, so I couldn't call up HR or anything.&nbsp; He asked for a phone book, so I gave him one and he found some places around town that would more than likely have the information he was seeking.&nbsp; I photocopied the pages for him (because he was handwriting the stuff, and I didn't want to be there forever) and he was grateful.&nbsp; Another ass saved by Amanda Becker....it makes me feel good.    &nbsp;  But here's the clincher:&nbsp; This guy is actually smart.&nbsp; Like, intelligent smart.&nbsp; I talked to him about politics, school, and toys from the eighties.&nbsp; I don't meet many dudes who say things like, "I was reading this book about Lyndon Johnson the other day..."&nbsp; My friend Mike refuses to pick up any book, unless it's a Chilton's manual.&nbsp; I spoke of my childhood faves, the Thundercats, and we sat and had an entire conversation about my mail-order Mumra, and why it was a better cartoon than He-Man.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  The Democratic National Convention&nbsp;on Fox News on the t.v. in the hospital lobby (I want a fair and balanced look, all right?), so we talked about politics and the like.&nbsp; This guy knew his shit and I learned some things.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I asked him what his name was and he blurted out "Aaron Robert Carlson".&nbsp; Just a first name would have done, but thank you Aaron R. Carlson for the intelligent conversation and here's some advice from perhaps the world' greatest procrastinator:&nbsp; Don't procrastinate.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; Thank you, and have a good night.

       The next time a guy tells me he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, I might not believe it.&nbsp; How can a person toss that around like it's nothing?&nbsp; That's your whole life...you sure you want to spend it with me?&nbsp; Or the girl you dated before me?&nbsp; Or your ex-wife before that?&nbsp; Or the girlfriend before you met your wife who you're seeing now because "it's different with her"?&nbsp; How many women do you plan on spending the rest of your life with?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  It means less when it's applied to every girl you meet, Chad.    &nbsp;  I'm happy for you, meaning I'm not jealous.&nbsp; It's really a lie that I'm happy because I think that you will continue to get hurt and bounce around from girl to girl.&nbsp; But that's your decision.&nbsp; Maybe you live for right now, and if you're happy RIGHT NOW, then I suppose that is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  P.S.&nbsp; I want my scrub pants back in exchange for your Monkey Bone DVD.&nbsp;

       My friend Steve left a comment on my last posting asking how Perry's soup was doing.&nbsp; Allow me to explain Perry and his soup for you who were fortunate enough to not work for Dusterhoft Oil.    &nbsp;  Perry Dobmeier, or Dobs if you will, is a live action version of Mr. Magoo.&nbsp; He's the cutest little dirty old man ever, and he walks around with a shop rag hanging out of his back pocket, inviting the shop jesters to try and light it like a fuse.&nbsp; Perry's been started on fire more times than he's fallen off the car hoists, which has been quite a few times.&nbsp; If Perry has fallen from up high, and is on fire, it is not an uncommon sight.&nbsp; This is the repair shop environment at DeMers Interstate Amoco...or at least, it was when I worked there.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  We used to make soup in the food shop during the winter months, and Perry was a big fan of the cheesy potato (probably still is, but they don't have soup anymore).&nbsp; Everyday, &nbsp;Steve would take the laser temperature taker and fire it into Perry's soup to check and see if it was hot enough.&nbsp; I'm not sure how hot it was supposed to be, but it amused Perry, so that's really all that matters.    &nbsp;  The laser temperature thing was a source of amusement for the shop guys.&nbsp; Cullen used to shoot the thing at everyone's crotch (it was just a harmless red dot, not an actual laser like in Star Trek or something), and he found out that his crotch was two degrees hotter than everyone else's in the shop.&nbsp; It was a proud moment.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Today Jenny and I brought her car over to WHERLEY VEHICLE MAINTENANCE in East Grand Forks so that my dad could take a gander at it.&nbsp; Her front passenger brakes were metal-on-metal.&nbsp; Dad replaced the pads and resurfaced the rotor.&nbsp; When he was explaining to Jennifer what he was doing, this is what I imagined her thinking:    &nbsp;  My dad:&nbsp; "Juniper, see this?&nbsp; It hasn't done much to the rotor, so we can still resurface it.&nbsp; The federal government requires the rotor to be a certain thickness, so if it was worn down more, we might have had to replace them."    &nbsp;  What Jennifer's thinking:&nbsp; "This is going to seriously cut into my hair colouring/treating/perming budget.&nbsp; Ugh, cars are so icky.&nbsp; I'll just have Amanda explain this to me later because I really don't care."    &nbsp;  What I'm thinking:&nbsp; "Man, my pants must've shrunk in the dryer."    &nbsp;  In other news, I finally reached my friend Todd (Meyers) by phone last night.&nbsp; His mom is dating a guy Todd refers to as "Old Man River".&nbsp; Todd said, "His name is Floyd, and he looks exactly like how his name sounds....like a Floyd."&nbsp; Todd was in Mexico for a week or more with his best friend Danny and his family, which is why he didn't call.&nbsp; So, fret not, for Todd is safe and sound in the desert once again.    &nbsp;  Carry on.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       So, I'm running out of pants to wear...I tried on an old pair yesterday that I forgot I even owned, and it took everything I had to button the button fly.&nbsp; Oof-da.&nbsp; The buttons could have been deadly weapons had they burst off and went airborne.&nbsp; Somebody, and I'm not naming names, needs to slow down with the Ben and Jerry's.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  When I worked at Amoco, I was constantly moving around, doing things, walking everywhere.&nbsp; Now that I work at the hospital, I sit in a chair mostly.&nbsp; The pants I wore working at Amoco no longer fit me after a year and a half at the hospital.&nbsp; Maybe there's something to be said for being a cashier.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       I haven't been to mass in like....months.&nbsp; I should really try and go tonight.&nbsp; I could have went last night with my friend Dawn, but a.) I didn't know she was going until ten minutes before mass started, b.) I totally forgot that I was Catholic.&nbsp; Well, I'm not "officially" Catholic, but you know, it seems like the thing to do in '04.     &nbsp;   As of late, my new thing to do is to make stuffed animals, or stuffed toys (as to not limit the scope of what I can create).&nbsp; Soft sculpture, if you will.&nbsp; I am happy to report that the bunny rabbit I'm making has an eye now, and a nose, and I'm almost done sewing the first arm.&nbsp; I was inspired to make these weird toys from visiting  urlLink www.esart.com , which is the website of artist Carol Es.&nbsp; She's got some fantastic shit, but my favourite is "Barnacle Jim, Not Piglet".&nbsp; That was what inspired me.&nbsp; Take a gander.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Trying to reach my friend Todd Meyers by phone is like pissing in the wind.&nbsp; He lives in Phoenix, so if anyone in Phoenix happens to read this (yeah right), keep your eyes peeled for a taller funny-looking gentleman in his early thirties but who looks like he's in his mid-twenties with a head full of black impossibly curly hair and who walks around thinking he knows everything.&nbsp; He has a permanently furrowed brow, and God forbid, if he's shirtless, he has the batman logo tattooed on his back.&nbsp; You can't miss him.&nbsp; If you're a hot chick, he's probably tried hitting on you with no luck by now.&nbsp; Tell him to call Amanda "The A.S.C. President" back in North Dakota.&nbsp; I don't miss him, but I kind of miss him...you know?     &nbsp;   Keith, if you're reading this, the Kay-Bee store went out of business in the mall.&nbsp; I know their selection of toys was pretty bad, probably because they had the smallest store in the whole mall, but still.&nbsp; The passing of a toy store is cause for mourning no matter what.     &nbsp;   Joseph, if you're reading this, will you marry me?&nbsp; That can be your birthday present to me this year.&nbsp; Come on, you know you love me.&nbsp; I promise no more of the following:     &nbsp;   *&nbsp; Getting drunk and falling over in a lawn chair    *&nbsp; Getting drunk and telling you that I love you    *&nbsp; Getting drunk    *&nbsp; Tell you that your mom makes K-Mart art.    *&nbsp; Getting mad when you lust after Rhonda     &nbsp;   And whatever else you want.&nbsp; I'm just saying.     Update on the wedding singer who has Whooping Cough:&nbsp; He has to be quarantined for five days and on anti-biotics.&nbsp; Of all the people who could have had a contagious illness, it would be the guy who sees every single person who walks into the hospital.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Fret not, for Willie will rise again.    &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       My dad got a CD for Father's Day called "Dylan Country", which is a CD composed of country (and western) singers covering Bob Dylan tunes.&nbsp; We have a lot of CD's like that, you know, like "Pickin' on Aerosmith", and one that is full of bluegrass versions of AC/DC songs.&nbsp; "Christine Sixteen" with a banjo?&nbsp; We got it.&nbsp; I think more people should utilize the banjo.&nbsp; I bought my dad a harmonica (and a teach-yourself booklet) for Christmas hoping we could rock out and form our own band, but he doesn't get a lot of free time to sit and teach himself.&nbsp; That's all right.&nbsp; Can't complain when he's putting a roof over my head.    &nbsp;  I got a new issue of Rolling Stone this week.&nbsp; I can't wait to see what kind of liberal-hippie-tree-hugger-commie-pinko bullshit it serves up this month.&nbsp; It was a birthday gift from Jenny for my 26th birthday, which I appreciate, since I thought it was a MUSIC magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your music is great, Coldplay, but I care about your opinion of George W. Bush just about as much as I care about George W. Bush's opinion about your music.&nbsp; Shut the fuck up and sing.    &nbsp;  Speaking of birthdays, mine is August 3rd, and I am happy to receive cash in lieu of gifts.&nbsp;

       I've been getting phone calls from someone whose name I do not recall, and last night while I was lying in bed reading, they called twice, and when I answered, no one made a sound.&nbsp; The name frequents my caller ID, yet, when I am around to answer, they say nothing.&nbsp; Shouldn't prank calls be more clever?&nbsp; Like the whole "Do you have Prince Albert in&nbsp;a can?" or "Is your refrigerator running?" etc. ad nauseum.    &nbsp;  Last night I went to my favourite grocery store to purchase magazines and cat litter, and I went past EVERY SINGLE AISLE in that store TWICE, and I didn't see cat food or cat litter or anything remotely related to felines.&nbsp; So, I purchased my magazines and asked the clerk if they carried cat litter (why they wouldn't, I don't know), and he said, "Aisle nine".    &nbsp;  Sure enough, I look over, and the sign hanging over aisle nine says "Pet Food".&nbsp; I swear up and down that it wasn't there before.&nbsp; "Darla?&nbsp; I can't come to work today because I'm delusional."

        While Willie (the wedding singer) and his wife remain at home quarantined with Whooping Cough, the admitting staff is safe from harm.&nbsp; The infection control manager says you'd have to spend at least an hour with him in order to be eligible for antibiotics.&nbsp; I just walk past the guy most days.     &nbsp;   Except for that one time....

       At the hospital where I work, we have what are called "patient assist" guys, and they help load patients into wheelchairs, and wheel patients to wherever they need to go.&nbsp; The one guy looks like the wedding singer (from the movie, you know?) and his name is Willie.&nbsp; Nice dude.&nbsp; Work called today and informed all of us that he and his wife (who works in administration) have come down with Whooping Cough, so we're all being offered free testing since we may have come in contact with him.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Rock and roll, people.&nbsp; My one lung that works thanks you.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Who gets Whooping Cough in 2004?&nbsp; That is SO early 1900's.&nbsp;      &nbsp;

       I've enlarged the font so this should be easier to read.&nbsp; I hope.    &nbsp;  Yesterday I supped with my good friend Mike, who was bemoaning the fact that he was losing two of his renters in August.&nbsp; I, being a problem solver (for others mostly, never for myself because I'd rather be self-pitious), suggested that we get married, that way I could pay half the rent and so forth.&nbsp; I thought it was a smashing idea, but Mike was thinking more along the lines of "How about you still live with your parents, and give me the money?"&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "What good would the marriage do me, then?" I asked.    &nbsp;  "You could check the box that says 'married' when you're filling out forms, then," he said.    &nbsp;  I didn't realize there was a social stigma on being single.&nbsp; Maybe there is.&nbsp; Who cares?&nbsp; Mike, I don't need your patriarchal bullshit, okay?&nbsp; I'm sticking it to the man (aka "the establishment", "whitey", etc.).&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I had a dream last night that I was little again, going to church at United Lutheran with my grandma and grandpa Becker.&nbsp; Then I dreamt that I was in school again, and that downtown Cavalier had changed.&nbsp; I have a dream about high school/elementary school/being little/the way things were when I was little at least, at LEAST once a week.&nbsp; Usually twice or more.&nbsp; But at least once.&nbsp; My&nbsp;therapist and I are doing something called "cognitive restructuring", which is supposed to take away all the bad feelings I had growing up and replacing them with positive messages.&nbsp; It's working okay, really, as a whole, but I still have dreams that take me back to the painfulness of youth.&nbsp; I didn't have it worse than anyone else, but it has stayed with me longer than most.&nbsp; I wish I could forget that shit and remember something useful, like my checking account number, or the phone number of that hot guy in Fargo that I like real well.    &nbsp;  My birthday is coming up on August 3rd, and if anyone wants to get me something, feel free to ask me what I want.&nbsp; If you don't want to bother with that, I will take cash in lieu of gifts.    &nbsp;  Good day!

       My best friend Jenny (or, Jennifer, if you're not down with the brevity) and I were rocking out to a CD of nineties songs we like today whilst driving.&nbsp; I like a little Kris Kros now and then.    &nbsp;  I am blessed today with a little something my dad likes to call a "dot".&nbsp; What kind of punctuation is a dot?&nbsp; Therein lies the answer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So, a few days ago I put fifty cents into a sticker/gumball machine, and I was granted a sticker that read "Don't Hold Your Breathe".&nbsp; I believe it should have said "Don't Hold Your Breath".&nbsp; The little drawing is of a pig, signed by low-brow artist Frank Kozik.&nbsp; Frank Frank Frank, you cannot be endorsing such grammatical no-no's such as this.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Thanks, Dad, for your support with my blog.&nbsp; He tells me that my mom doesn't understand what a weblog (blog) is, but soon she will know it's just a cyber-soapbox on which I stand.&nbsp; I love you, Mom and Dad.

       When I get up in the morning, I usually make my way upstairs to have some breakfast and do some serious dinking around before I get myself ready for the day.&nbsp; Every morning there are three cats lounging at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; If that doesn't make me want to go crawl back into bed........&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I had a list of things in my head that I wanted to get done today before I go to work, but I can't seem to remember any of the items on the list.&nbsp; I think one of them was to start writing stuff down.     &nbsp;   A friend of mine has an extra GWB sticker (he contributed to the campaign), and he said I could have it only if I display it proudly.&nbsp; As if there were any other way to display it.&nbsp; I haven't seen too many bumper stickers as of late proclaiming support for either party, but yesterday I saw a John Kerry sticker on a Denali that had Turtle Mountain reservation plates on it.&nbsp; The part about the John Kerry sticker and the reservation plates made sense, but for some reason the SUV seemed out of place.&nbsp; I thought democrats drove pieces of shit cars because the republicans are evil capitalist pigs trying to keep the little guy down, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Oh, and sorry about the fact that you have to create a blog to comment on my postings.&nbsp; I never read the fine print.&nbsp;

       Dear Rolling Stone Magazine,      My best friend Jennifer gave me a subscription to your magazine for my 26th birthday.  Every month I endure your highly-partisan not-much-music packed pages.  I suggest you put out two magazines:  One for people who want to read about music, and one just like the one you make now.  I'll expect the former in my mailbox monthly.  Hey, wait, I'll just subscribe to BLENDER, because at least their captions are funny.       Sincerely,   Amanda R. Becker      ___________________________________________      In other news, I woke up before nine today and haven't fallen back asleep yet.    Jenny made us a five-point dinner (which is at noon) yesterday, and it was excellent.  I now know why weight is lost with this diet:  it makes me poop.  Lots.        You know how that one kid in your class in school was kind of chubby for a while, until he hit high school, and then he lost all his baby fat?  Why did this not happen to me?  Ugh.  I hate having to work at things in order to reap benefits.        I'm kidding.  But, am I?

       I parked behind a Rav-4 yesterday in the parking lot at work.  I happened to notice two bumper stickers on it:  one was a Kerry-Edwards sticker, and the other one read, "How many lives per gallon?"  That's so clever.  But not really.        If you do a little research, you'll find that half the oil we consume comes from right here in the States, and the other half comes from other countries, the top three being Canada, Venezuela, and Mexico.       I know it's trendy in Hollywood now to be a Bush-hater (like how it's trendy to be Jewish, right Madonna?  Does the Kabbalah Centre support your half-naked writhing around on stage with men who aren't your husband?), but let's get our facts straight.  It's one thing to be wrong, but it's another thing to be wrong and stupid.

       I made the mistake of calling Mike today before noon.  He was at work, and asked if I could let Dog out because he (Mike) didn't have a lunch break today.  He also said that I "should go to Conlin's [Furniture] and check out prices on recliners".  Should?  I should do a lot of things.  I should pay my bills on time, I should save money up, I should remember to take my pills everyday, I should be less vocal about my opinions sometimes, I should have started dieting about five months ago so I don't look like a satin sausage for Tracy's wedding.  Should have should have.  If you say "should" a lot and stare at the word, it becomes odd.      I will stop now.      Today my family will celebrate Adam and Grandma Dee Dee's birthdays with a collective fiesta at casa de Sayler.  We're having turkey and all the fixin's.  I imagine my diet and I as a little teeny compact fuel-efficient car, and my grandma's meals like a huge steam roller coming straight for us.  Mmm...dressing and gravy.  Come to Amanda-clese.

       Toonces caught mouse number six last night.  Ninja was supervising.  Albert was sleeping.        In other news, I'm still hungry.  I had a couple of graham crackers for breakfast so that I wouldn't devour the container of cookies that were sitting on the counter.  Good save, Amanda.  Last night I had the opportunity to  cheat, but I didn't...much to my own surprise.  How I long for the creamy rich peanut buttery goodness of Ben and Jerry's.  No, that's okay, I'd rather have this succulent orange.        I lie.      I had a dream last night that my vehicle of choice was a rolling office chair.  That would be a lot easier than trying to find a parking spot, you know?  I could just roll myself to work, and use the chair, and then roll home.  I'd bring my chair into Wherley Vehicle Maintenance to get new wheels and have them do a routine check on it.  I wouldn't receive parking tickets on Wednesdays and my dad wouldn't have to move my car into the driveway on Wednesdays so that I can avoid getting a parking ticket.  Musical cars.  No more speeding tickets...wait, they'd probably give me one anyway.  "Didn't you see this sign, Miss Becker?  You can't go over ten feet per second.  It's the law.  I'm going to have to write you a ticket."        I'd paint flames on it.

       Congratulations to Jeremy Pollestad, another Dusterhoft Oil employee who has successfully abandoned ship.  All that's left is my good friend Robb, seeing as the others that I know will always be there.  You can tell a lifer....but you can't tell him much.  (ba-dump-bump).      Check this link out:   urlLink http://www.grandforks.com/mld/grandforks/9377915.htm    That's some crazy shit.  Thanks to Eric for pointing it out.      So......this is awkward.  I have nothing to say.

       Day Three of keeping track of food points.  Jenny insists I don't "get it", but I do get it.  It's loud and clear.  It's coming in 5 X 5.  I get it already.  However, being the bigger one of the two, I get more points for the day than she does.  There are advantages to being thick.      Here is the new trend America should follow:  The Amanda Diet.  If you come home and have a ham sandwich with cheese and mayo on wheat bread, Weight Watchers will say "Well, that's a million and five points", whereas the Amanda Diet states that "Well, I could have went to McDonald's and bought three sandwiches off the dollar menu, plus fries and a soda, and stopped at Mini Mart for a king-size candy bar, and polished off that half bag of candy in my cubby at work, plus had five more litres of soda, but I didn't -- I had a frickin' sandwich on wheat bread."        I bet if we all lived on farms, we'd all be healthy despite eating fried everything with a big frosty glass of fatty-ass milk.  Unfortunately, I'm lazy...so I'll just have my frickin' sandwich.      And my big frosty glass of fatty-ass milk.  Hey, at least my bones won't break when I'm ninety.

      Let it be known that I am hungry.  I had a frickin' Lean Cuisine meal for dinner (which is at noon), and a Pop-Tart (which was a billion points, by the way).   Stacy wore a turtleneck sweater to work today.  It's that cold out.  This is the best August ever!

       I went to Employee Health today to get my annual TB screening.  The receptionist inquired about the ribbon on my sweater.  It's a dollar bill that's been folded into the shape of a ribbon (like any "awareness" ribbon) in such a manner that the "In God We Trust" is showing on the top part.  I replied that it's my "Deficit Reduction Awareness Ribbon", which I learned to make from a Rush Limbaugh newsletter that my old man used to get.  She thought it was great.  I just want to fit in with the cool kids who wear ribbons for various causes.        Dear Everyone in Town:      I still am aware that my gas cap door is open.  Honk away, but it's not going to bring back the plastic piece that busted off that latches it.      It's cold outside.  I was wearing mittens last night.  Mittens, in August.  I love living here.  This, THIS is what it should be like all summer.  Cool and breezy.        The lady at the DMV today was less than enthusiastic about me trying to pay with my cheque card.  Oh, sorry, I didn't see the tiny-ass sign that says "Cheque or Cash Only".  Why not have a credit card machine?  I mean, at least then you know that if it doesn't work, it'll say so.  Cheques, who knows?  Accepting a cheque from a customer is like putting a bullet in a revolver, spinning the chamber, and then firing.  I know these things; I have written bad cheques before, and I have also taken bad cheques from customers having no idea that they were NSF or had closed accounts.        Dear Chad,      Where the fuck are my scrub pants?  Happy birthday on Friday -- celebrate it by dropping my pants off at my work.

       Today Jenny and I started keeping track of our food points.  We've done this before.  Then we've stopped.  Then we've started again.  Then we've stopped.  Etc.  I don't know how long this will last, especially since Pepsi Co. still makes Mountain Dew.      Recommended CD purchase:  Yeah Yeah Yeahs "Fever to Tell".      My dad is watching an ACLU debate about the Patriot Act.  I asked Dad how he could sit and watch that shite, and he said, "Know thine enemy".  Makes sense.      Albert caught mouse number five last night.  He gave half of it back this morning on the floor.

       Last night while my dad and I were drilling holes in the cement walls downstairs, my littlest soldier, Toonces, found another mouse.  We weren't going to tell Mom, but she woke up from the sound of the drill, and came downstairs and wondered what the blood on the floor was from.  Busted.        Mom thinks we should call an exterminator.  I think we should get another cat.  It'd be like increased security.  My idea was shot down, needless to say.  However, my diploma and my certificates of excellence from Altru hospital are all proudly displayed now on the walls of my living area.  I think that's the real issue here.

        I received this in an e-mail, and I'm not sure who to give credit to since there was not an author listed, but it rings true. I'm sure I'll get some disagreements, but I say this to you: So what?      "Learn these facts to properly debate our poor misguided friends &amp; family before election time !!!  There were 39 combat related killings in Iraq during the month of January.....In the fair city of Detroit there were 35 murders in the month of January. That's just one American city, about as deadly as the entire war torn country of Iraq.  When some claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war, state the following :  FDR... led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us: Japan did.From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per yr .  Truman...finished that war and started one in Korea, North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost, an average of 18,334 per year.  John F. Kennedy... started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us.  Johnson...turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost, an average of 5,800 per year.  Clinton...went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent, Bosnia never attacked us. He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and did nothing. Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.  In the two years since terrorists attacked us President Bush has ...liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people.  The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but...it took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation. We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records. It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Ted Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick. It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in Florida!!!!  Our Commander-In-Chief is doing a GREAT JOB! The Military moral is high! The biased media hopes we are too ignorant to realize the facts."      Today I took my Sgt. Pepper figurines out of their packaging. I've owned the first four toys for five years, and I recently purchased the second set of four on e-Bay. I understand their value dropped the minute I opened the packages, but that's not really why I bought them. I just wanted to visually ogle them and be able to hold them. They're my toys, dammit. I can do what I want.

       Around town, there are fifty or so large forks (they stand a little over six feet, I think) that various artists have received in order to manipulate in whatever fashion they wanted.  It's called "UnFORKgettable", and a business in town called Young Manufacturing made all these large forks, which are attached to circular bases.  I wondered how one would go about joining the cult that was allowed to make this large art, because it's not like they announced a gathering for local artists -- only a select group who were "in the know" were given forks.        If you bitch loud and long enough, you'll get a fork....for your birthday!      Greg and Jenny gave me my first gift, and when I opened it, it was a plaque that read: "The Missing Fork -- Amanda Becker 'The Great' ".  I was like, awesome!  And then they took me outside and there was a giant fork in front of the house!  Greg called Young Manufacturing, and they had some extra ones, and the rest is history.        Isn't that fucking cool as hell?  Take that, pompous art cult of Grand Forks.  I'm onto you.

       I'm 27 now.  It's not bad so far, seeing as I'm only eleven hours into it.  My mom left me a note on the table that says "Happy Birthday!" on it instead of "Please vacuum, dust, change litter boxes, empty the A/C pail, clean your room, do the dishes, and remember to take your pills."  My dad's notes are far simpler, written on the back of envelopes from places that want money from me, saying "PAY THIS NOW".  He gets to the point.  But he had "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" written on the screen saver for me, so that was pretty damn cool.      Mike got me a windchime for my birthday, and he gave it to me a few weeks ago.  My friend Eric got me a twenty-dollar gift certificate to Amazon.com.  Dawn bought me a pint of my favourite ice cream, and two of those big cookies from Hugo's with cats and mice on them (I feel sorry for people with a vermin problem), and a "Happy Birthday" one.  Bless their hearts.      Jenny and Greg went in on a gift together, and Jenny has been vibrating like a tuning fork because she's so excited.  She said I'd absolutely love it.  I'd love a fifty-cent toy from a gumball machine if it was gift-wrapped.  I figure a gift is something given to you that is something you didn't have before, so any gift is a great gift.         Mouse update :  Albert caught a third one yesterday afternoon.  My mom was so pissed.  The cats think it's great.      Happy birthday to me.

       Jenny and I believe that every work place has a Bob from Accounting.        We drive around every winter before Christmas to look at everyone's Christmas light displays, and one night, there were an awful lot of Christmas parties going on in suburbia.  Do you know how easy it would have been to show up there and crash the party without them knowing we were crashing the party?      Us:  "Hey guys!  We're here!"   Them:  "We don't remember you two from around the office..."   Us:  "Oh, we're new....Bob from accounting invited us."   Them:  "Bob?"   Us:  "Yeah....you know, Bob....from accounting."   Them:  "Oh, you mean Robert?"   Us:  "Yes!  Robert...we call him 'Bob' because, you know, we're down with the brevity."   Them:  "Well, come on in!  Robert can't be here tonight because he's at his kids' Christmas program at the school."   Us:  "Ah, yes.  He will be missed tonight."      See?  Seamless.  Solid.  Thunderbirds are go.

       As I poured over the literal stylings of US magazine last night, Toonce was on the prowl again.  She found another mouse.  This time, though, Ninja and Albert were in on it, too.  Ninja puffed up and played with it for a while, and then Albert made his way downstairs and joined in on the fun.  I asked my dad how many more mice he thought might be down there, and he said, "Oh, that should be the last one", as if there's some zoning law in Grand Forks that only allows two mice per household.        I decided this week that I should make an investment in a bumper sticker that says, "I know my gas cap is open, it doesn't latch, so quit honking, waving, and yelling at me".        A LETTER TO THE NURSES ON SIXTH FLOOR:      Dear Nurses on Sixth Floor,      I would like to designate one day out of the year where you will not complain about getting an admit.  I think today would be a good day for that, August the Deuce.  It's an Icelandic holiday, and the day before my birthday, so when I call up there and want you to take a patient with pneumonia and a lung mass, don't feed me that "Well, just because he has a lung mass doesn't mean it's cancer, and we should really only be taking cancer, renal and detox patients" bullshit, or that "Well, he may be a cancer patient, but he's not on chemo and is being admitted with abdominal pain and that could go anywhere" crap.        Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.      Sincerely,      Amanda R. Becker, Admissions Coordinator   _________________________________________________________________________      In other news, my face thinks I'm twelve and is breaking out in a manner that is reminiscent of the kids who take my money at the window at McDonald's.        Film at eleven.

       If you felt the earth move today, it's because I'm cleaning my living area.  Yes, that is right, it's a LIVING AREA, not a bedroom, not an apartment, but instead it's almost the whole entire basement.  Yes, I live with my parents, and no, I'm not ashamed.  I'm eternally grateful, seeing as I was digging a hole of debt and people kept throwing me shovels.  My dad is offering a dowry of one Harley-Davidson motorcycle, a 1956 Chevy 4X4 pickup with a considerable lift on it, and fifty bucks for someone to marry me and take me out of the house.  I don't even want to know the kind of guy I'd get in exchange for that stuff.  I digress.      First thing I assessed about the living area:  There is a lot of birdseed everywhere.   Second thing:  I have a lot of things that are not classifiable other than "piles of shit".     Third thing:  How can I hang stuff on the cement walls?   Fourth thing:  Not a big fan of the Los Lonely Boys pumping on the stereo.   Fifth:  Is Mom making supper?    Sixth:  Wow!  Old Rolling Stone mags!  I should dust every page to make sure...   Seventh:  Where did I get this?   Eighth:  I wish this turntable worked so I could spin some phat wax (i.e. my Sgt. Pepper album).   Ninth:  What was I doing down here again?  Cleaning?      I have a short attention sp--HEY!  Mom made brownies!  Mmm....stuff that's bad for me.      P.S.  Mike's dog peed on my leg today.     P.P.S.  I washed my pants.   P.P.P.S.  They're probably too small now.
