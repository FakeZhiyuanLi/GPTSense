      Hmmm, well, just recalling back my days since I wanted to start a new month I might as well start from yesterday, June 1, 2004.    I went to the airport last Monday to see my freind Sarah go to Toronto.  It felt different seeing her off knowing that it would be a while the next time I see her again...   As for yesterdaym I pretty much just studied all day long and wrote an exam that same morning.  Didn't do too much yesterday.  I had lunch with Minh.  He took me to Subway.  The moment when he asked me the question "do you have gas? we'll take your car."  Right there and then I blew up on him.  I guess it's because we've been taking my car a lot for the past month.  I just got really irritated.  But after getting that off of my chest, I felt a lot better.   Today, after writing my exam I went to have ice-cream with Minh.  Just telling him the story of my high school friends.  It was really nice just to talk to him like that.  Sharing him a part of my past, eating ice-cream and just enjoying the day.  Then we went to his store.  Everything was good until he made a comment that I look like I'm prego.  Hmmm, it made me feel really insecured about myself.  I guess it's because deep down I know that I have gained weight but I haven't done much about it, but for my boyfriend to point it out, it sure was an eye opener!  But yeah, after talking about things, we had laughs and our moments together once again.  It was really nice to have that with him again.

      Well today I went to work for a different department.  I wasnt' too thrilled about doing that project, but nevertheless, at least I have a job.  Then my boyfriend came to see me at work today, and took me to Shangri-la for lunch.  It was a good lunch.  I was really full after eating with him.  Then my friend Shirley came to see me at work.  We went to St.Vital for a bit.  Then she wanted to eat, and guess where we ate?  At North Garden.  Another Chinese Restaurant...  But that's okay, the food was good and it was really nice just to see my girl again.  Then after that we drove to this park that I always go to.  We walked around there and took pictures.  We just sat at one of the bench and just enjoyed nature watching over the lake.  I love that place.  It's just so peaceful.  A place that I can call my own.    As for tonight, I just got home.  As tired as I am right now, I know that I should start getting into shape.  First thing is first, get your gym clothes on and start getting active!!!  By the way, here is what it says on my fortune cookie: "You are heading towards a place where you will be surrounded of sunshine"  :)  Profile: Eileen Chiara Cabrera Age: 24 Weight: 110 lbs.

      Well since I didnt' update my day-to-day event here's a recap...  Friday, spent the whole day to myself.  Felt really good just to be able to rejuvenate and to have that time all to myself!  Then my boyfriend Minh came over to pick me up.  It's been a while since we had our "Date Night."  I took the time to look all good for him.  I wore my red top with jeans and I managed to put my hair up.  I think he liked it...  He said I looked pretty ;)  He took me out to Tony Romas for supper.  We had a nice dinner together.  Then we went to Silver City to see "Shrek 2" really funny movie.  Then it started raining really hard so we drove around the city in the rain.  I always love the rain.  We stopped by at the Keg and ended the night there....  Saturday, went to work and then came home to drive my mom to Superstore.  A few hours later I came to pick her up and dropped off my dad's glasses for him at Victoria Hospital where he was working.  Then I was supposed to go to a bridal shower @ 6:00 but I decided not to go.  Then took off to Osborne to meet up with Rowena and Edralyn for supper at the Spicy Noodle House.  I wanted to set Rowena up with one of Minh's friends really badly.  However, at first sight of Rowena I knew it's not going to work out.  I wasn't getting any vibes from her that it will work out. She seemed somewhat interested but she doesn't want to be obvious about it, I decided to go along with it.  Then we decided to go to Corydon for ice-cream, but somehow we ended up going to my house instead.  We were there for a good hour and a half.  The anticipation to hear from Minh was building up every minute.  I guess it's because I wanted to go but I just don't know when.  Subconciously I think a part of me was a little disappointed at my boyfriend because this whole bbq was planned out a month ago and because of the changed of plans, I didn't like the idea that I dragged two other people along with it.  But deep down I know it's not his fault, but when he called me that night, telling me he wasn't sure when he'll be off, didn't quite help me in the situation.  I guess in my point of view I have to be understanding, which is okay.  The car ride going to his friend's house was quite different.  We both know there's a feeling of awkwardness.  I just blocked all that off and focused on the purpose of introducing Rowena and Edralyn to Minh's friends.  But throughout the night, I wasn't quite impressed with the way Rowena presented herself.  I know that my boyfriend's friends deserves someone better.  Every woman is sweet on their own sense, but if you don't see that sweet side to her within the first second, it will take awhile to find that...  I think just sitting apart from Minh that night at the party felt really different for the two of us.  After the party I was standing infront of my car, but since everything was already awkward between Minh and I, the parting was even more awkward than expected.  I guess just not being able to be close to him that night, put a wedged between us.  I felt like I was getting the cold shoulders from him, and the moment he tried to give me a kiss goodnight, I wasn't feeling the closeness there, so I pulled away.  I guess there are other thoughts going through my mind.  Thinking that I know how important it is for him to work and everything, but I guess I dont' know if situations like that would happen again.  Say we planned something ahead of time in the future and he tries booking it off early, but for some reason he can't get that off, I guess I have always have to understand that he has to work.  I think that's where a huge part of me don't know how to deal with that situation. Obviously I didn't take it very well.  I didn't even understand why I kept pulling away from him and I was becoming distant from him, mainly because I was preparing myself so that if that does happen again, I would know how to deal with it.  The way I dealt with it, is by logging on the net to try to find him a new job.  But I think to myself, why do that, if the person themselves is happy with their job why change that?  I know now that if that ever happens again, I have to be more supportive of him.  In a way I'm glad that the bbq didn't happen at his house.  Coz here I am trying to stress myself over to please others, Rowena in this particular situation, when I should have been pleasing my man first.  I didn't do that.  I didn't even asked him, if he ate, or how his day was, but rather, I pressured him to get off work early so we could go to the bbq.  I now realized what I did wrong.  That night I know how much I was hurting Minh by not opening up to him.  Instead I tried putting things off by walking around the block with him.  After that night, our parting was just really different.  One thing is for sure, we were both doubting ourselves if we should even be together...  I woke up today and I was getting ready to go to church.  Other things started coming to mind.  Minh had asked me to go to "Hoop It Up" with him to see his friends play.  I already told him the night before to go without me.  I guess a part of me knows that I have responsibilities and that I have to be at church because of the commitments that I have to make.  Yet a part of me felt that if I go, my heart and my mind wouldn't be into it.  One thing for sure I learned from church, is to never go there knowing that your heart is not fully there.  Fix things up first with an open mind and an open heart then come back to church when you're ready to do that.  I went to Minh's house and we went for a walk to the park to talk.  He poured his heart to me and I myself don't even know what's going on with me.  I couldn't explain it until I started typing these words out.  One thing for sure I learned, is to put aside my pride and to return back to my man.  Coz I sure know that I miss him as much as he has missed me.  He tells me that everyday, but I haven't really been listening.  This time I know what I have done wrong.  We spent the whole day today.  We went to see his dad with his mom, and then we went to Kildonan Park to talk.  It sure made me smile on the way home, coz I know that my man still LIKES ME....  ;)    If you're reading this:  "MINH LUKE TRAN, I LOVE YOU MORE AND MORE EACH DAY."  We may have disappointing moments, but I learned now to be more understanding of you.  You're all worth it baby.    *muah* thank you, drive thru!

      Well, work today was alright.  I foudn out that I will be going to a new branch and work as a teller once again.  In a way, I'm really happy because I wasn't too thrilled doing this project that I was currently assigned to do.  But yeah, work is alright.  After work I decided to go home first and just clear my mind.  I figured if I wanted to get health I have to start eating healthy first and to set your mind on that particular goal.  So for lunch today, I brought a salad for work and a grapefruit.  Then after I got home I worked out for half an hour, using the "Saturne Elyptical" and then I did pilates for 10 min.  I was really exhausted by then.  Then Minh called me on the phone.  I was really excited to hear his voice.  I didn't get to see him today and I was really planning to before I met up with my friend Sam.  In my mind, I wanted to be the sweet woman that he fell in love with in the beginning.  I wanted to take in every word that he was saying, listening to his voice I've been imagining it all day.  But the conversation with him stirred up to the other direction.  The moment I softened up that's when he hardened up.  That's what would always happen between us.  If one is softening up the other one will hardened up and vice versa, that's why we never seem to meet in the middle.  I guess this time around it's my turn to soften up.  Talking to him today, to me felt like he didn't really want to hear what I had to say, or at least he wasn't really interested in hearing about it.  So I didn't really want to say anything more so I just let him talk.  I want to be patient and understanding of him, but for the most part I really don't know how.  I'm pretty sure that he's feeling the same way as I do, yet we don't know how to meet each other in the middle.  We go from one extreme to the other.  I don't know what it was about our conversation today, but I was hurting so much.  I wanted to work things out between us, but I know that we have our shortcomings.  I don't even know where to start.  We say that we listen, but are we really listening to what the other person is really trying to say?  Or are we too focused on our ownselves?  I think for me, for the most part, I focused more on myself rather than on him.  Like I said, I will put my pride aside and try to really listen, then maybe I could a better sense as to where he's coming from.  When you say you truly love someone, you don't just give up on them.  But rather you must try harder.  Tomorrow is another day...

      Well today at work was really good.  For starter, I got lost going there so I came in late.  Then I got a parking ticket.  Other than that, I really enjoyed working at that branch (WestBroaway).  I have never served that many Pana's in any other branches before.  But I'm glad that I did, coz it opened up my eyes to many things, that you should treat everbody equally.    Then after work I came to see Shirley.  We were just talking about her problems about a lot of things.  As a friend there's only so much I could do.  But the important thing is that I'm there to listen.    Then my boyfriend Minh came over.  Kissing him on that moment felt so good.  Just to throw my arms around him, felt like the first time.  The anticipation and excitement, I was really feeling it.  We then went to the park I always go to.  We sat by the lake and we talked about our relationship.  We both recognized that there's something not right with how things are going.  Minh talked about how the ups and downs between us is mainly because of him.  He also recognized that because of the way he was acting that he was making me unhappy.  Last night after I wrote my thought on here I called him up on the phone.  I was missing him so much and at the same time I felt so hurt, but now I feel like a big weight off my shoulders have been lifted up.  I was able to express to him that there are things about our relationship that needs fixing.  He told me that if he hurts me again that he would break it off with me.  I asked him if I said no, what's he going to do about it.  He knows that he has to try harder.  In the back of my mind, I will never let him go.  If by all means it takes all my energy away from, all the talks we have to go through, the tears and many more mixed feelings, I know that I will hold on to him.  Just recalling on my drive to Perkins on the first day that I met him, I was telling myself that I'm going to meet the man that I plan to marry someday.  I don't know what made me think that but in my mind I know that someday I will make him mine.  I'm completely sure that I have never felt like that about anyone else other than the man that I am with now.  I guess that's what love is all about, love is patience, kindness, and never selfish.  From this day on, June 8th 2004 @ 11:45 A.M. I know that things will get better between us.  He told me so.  All I have to hold on to are his words.  I believe every word he said to me.  Love is crazy, I'm crazy in love with Minh ;)

      Well since I didn't get to update my blog yesterday I'll recap it today.  Wednesday, I started my day by meeting my loving boyfriend at Perkins for breakfast.  It was really nice to start your day by seeing that one person that you truly care about.  He was the last person I talked to on the phone and he was also the first one I saw that day.  It was really sweet.  I ordered eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and pancakes.  I was stuffed like a pinata!  Then as usual I worked.  Work is work, nothing all that exciting about it.  I came to see my friend Phoirs during my lunch break.  Got to chat with her and saw her baby Brandon.  He's getting really big now, and he's a real cutie that's for sure.  Then my boyfriend Minh came to see me at work.  I didn't expect that, but nevertheless, it was nice.  Then after work I had to go to St.James branch for a baby shower.  I got to see my crew as well as some co-workers of mine from St.Mary's.  I ate at the branch, I ate lot's!  Then by the time I got home, within an hour, guess who I saw again?  That's M-I-N-H!  We started talking at my house about my nephew and his niece saw each other at Kindergarten open house for parents to meet the teachers.  It's quite ironic how my brother met his brother.  Before it was meet the niece and nephew, then meet the mom's, now it's meet the brother's.  What a scenario eh...  :)  Then Minh and I went for a walk around my neighbourhood.  We even saw a movie being filmed at one of the houses.  Then we kept walking and stopped by 7-11 coz I was so thirsty, thank heaven!  Of course Mr. Tran keeps on getting tired so he had to sit every 5 min.  My legs hurt, my back is soar, I need to sit down.  Okay there Lolo!  *hahahhaha*  jk.  That was my whole day.  By the way, I was thinking of setting Rowena up and Harold once again.  But unfortunately, under certain circumstances things didn't work out.  Oh well, can't force these things to happen.  Thursday, came to work and found out we have no water.  That's alright I suppose.  Then came my lunch hour and I called my boyfriend and told him I was on the parking lot to move my car.  So we kept talking on the phone.  Little does he know that I was on my way to see him at the store.  The moment I walked in the store just looking at him talking to me on the phone, it's PRICELESS!  I love doing that to him!  Coz I always get him.  When he least expects it, that's when I do things.  Also it's because ever since we had that talk when we really opened up to each other, everything seemed really good now.  I'm not mad at him, I'm not holding things back from him, I don't feel irritated by him in any way, we both still going with the flow.  It feels like the same feeling I had when I just first got to know him.  The excitement of wanting to see him and not getting enough of him, makes me feel all "tingly" inside.  I just love hugging him and kissing him, and everything else that I do, you know what those are!  ;)  *wink,wink,nudge,nudge" uh-huh, that's right, it's all good!  Everyday I come up with all these ideas that I want to do for him and get for him, but one at a time.  I have to make enough money first.  I feel like I got my old self back again.  This is the real me.  The spontaneous, creative, sweet, and loving girlfriend that he met, I'm beginning to see that now.  I always knew that I can be sweet, but when you're in love with someone your true sweetness really does come out.  I guess it's because when you're in love with the person you always put their feelings first before your own.  Their happiness becomes a priority and when you see them happy you know that you're truly happy yourself.  Yes, I can honestly say and without a doubt that I am truly happy with Minh.  Not just by the way he treats me, but by the way he makes me feel, simply and truly happy.  Because of the ups and downs we've put ourselves to, made us both realized our shortcomings and to have a better understanding of one another as well as our own selves, and most importantly, we came out stronger and better.  I guess it's true, "You can't truly be happy until you know what's it's like to be miserable."  That's my word of the day.  Always enjoy and appreciate the person you're with now.  Never take them for granted, always to love, cherish, and respect one another.  Those are the key ingredients to a loving and stronger relationship.    To be continued.....

      Well today didn't do too much.  Of course, I worked this morning.  Really busy today at work.  But yeah, it was alright.  By the time I got home, I was so exhausted!!  Don't know why.  But the feeling of being home alone and not having Sarah around on a Friday night, it's beginning to hit me now.  I really miss her...  I did managed to keep myself occupied, however the thought of Minh keeps lingering on my mind.  Just the memories we shared together.  I loved the time when we watched a movie at school and he was lying on me, I remembered when he looked at me and told me "they have a plan."  He was smiling at me and at the same time getting all excited about the movie, I just stared at his beautiful eyes and smiled back.  From the first hugs at Kelseys, to the first time we held hands at Moxies, to our first kiss on New Year's Eve, yup we've had quite a few good memories we could look back to.  I love every moment of it all.  The thoughts of him just penetrates through my soul. We shared each other's dream as we hold each other tight.  It feels so real and so right.  I hoped to be married to this wonderful man someday soon.  There's nothing I wouldn't do for him once were married.  Just moments like these when I have time to myself to reflect back on my life, sure I had my share on the up's and down's life has to offer.  Many headaches and heartaches, but in the end, it's all worth it.    I took the time to thank God for all the great things in my life.  It's been a while since I really prayed when I had that intimate moment with God.  It felt really good to do that again once again, to just talk to him.  If I had another chance to live my life all over again, I don't think I would really change much.  Life is full of surprises and mystery.  I always thought that special someone will never find me, that I might grow old without really knowing how to love others.  In reality, the moment I loved myself and others, love found me.  Through love you will find the true meaning of happiness.  Always try to be nice and to do good deeds to others, your reward of joy will come to you.    I just finished watching "The Pianist" after watching that movie geared my perspective in life into a whole new direction.  Well, maybe not into a whole new direction, but rather it made me realized how good I have it.  I only look at the imperfections in life, but I never take the time to appreciate the perfections of what I have.  I truly am grateful for everything.  For all the people I encountered in life whether if be from my past, present, or future, those people makes me the person that I am.  They were chosen from heaven for me to meet.  Thank you.  You will always be my angel sent from above especially for me.

      Well Saturday all I did was work.  Had breakfast at Perkins with co-workers then went to church for practice then went home.  My boyfriend came to my house and picked me and we saw that movie "Day after tomorrow."  I really liked the movie.  It was really good.  The only flaw from that is that we were way too close to the screen.  It's alright.  Then came Sunday.  I went to church and did my thang with the kids.  Then I went back upstairs and to my surprised I saw Minh there.  I was quite thrilled to see him there.  I guess it's because I didn't expect to see him there and there he was!  We stayed at church for a bit coz he wanted to listen to Sam.  Then we came to his house.  The sweetest thing Trinity did was to run up to me and gave me a hug.  That was a really nice feeling knowing that his niece likes me.  Then while we were in the van she asked me to play telephone with her.  She whispered in my ear "tell uncle to buy you a present."  So I whispered that back to Minh and she told him to buy me a present, particularly a ring.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I have never felt so accepted until I actually heard it from her.  It was a wonderful feeling.  It's another priceless moment.  Then we went to Assiniboine Park for Roshel's wedding shower.  After we ate, Minh and I went for a walk around the park.  It was really nice :)  Then I asked Minh to stop by house to pick up my mom.  Then his mom came down to see our house for the first time and she also met my dad.  My dad gave her a tour to our house.  Just watching them talking, smiling and everything, again, it was a sweet moment.  It feels like everything is falling to it's place.  That our parents accepts one another and from the look of it, we already have their blessings for any future arrangements.  Eventhough it's only been almost 6 months next week, but it's not all about the quantity, but rather, the quality.  Minh, in your eyes everything that I could see is what tomorrow could bring us.  There's so much to look forward to each and everyday.  Every moments that we share together is even better than the moment before.  Everday was, is as good as the day was.  I can't wait until tomorrow comes, coz it's going to be another moment with you!

      As usual at least half of my day revolves around work.  But as for Monday, I went out on a date with my boyfriend!  Since it's been a tradition between Minh and I to go to Pho # 1, I guess yesterday would have been the month of June.  It was really nice and sweet just to sit across the table from him and we just talked and for the most part, we were laughing and enjoying each other's company just like the first time when he took me there.  I really enjoyed it~  Then we went to see a movie, "Girl next door."  The movie was alright. It wasn't the best yet it wasn't the worst either.  It was aight...    Then today, again I went to work.  Same ol' same ol' work.  Then went to Red River to get scheduled fixed.  since yesterday I've been racking my brain as to what exactly I want to do with my life.  I thought to myself and realized that it's about time that I move forward and stop dwelling in trying to finish up to get my degree at UofM.  The more I try harder it will work against me, so I realized that I can gain a lot more by moving on and at the same time still be able to achieve both by being able to to finish at a later time and at the same time doing something more with my life other than school.  I have to take things one step at a time.  I learned in life that not everything can be achieved through taking the short-cuts.  It may seem all good in the beginning thinking that it will get you to your destination quicker but in reality, based on my own experienced, it took me longer.  But that's okay, coz I gained so much through this wonderful journey.  I gained a wonderful friend, best friend, and a lover.  I gained all that and more...  Geez, just typing these words out and thinking about you right now, its making me smilez :)  awww, MINH I REALLY DO LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH.  I will give you everything that I am endlessly.  Thank you for giving me reasons to smile about everdday I wake up in the morning and before I go to sleep at night.  I will always remember the time I first fell in love, coz it's with you.  It's a beautiful moment.  The first time I ever told you that I love you, and it will certainly not be the last.  I LOVE YOU.  *muah*

      Hmm, I'm not gonna go into details about my work, because that's something I do on a day to day basis these past few weeks now and will be doing for a while.  But rather I will just let my emotions take over me and will type whatever comes to mind.  I guess for the most part I always talk about how wonderful of a relationship I am in.  I know a huge part of me is that I am happy with the man that I am with.  But let's get realistic here right, as much as you would like the "so called perfect man" to be perfect, in reality there's no such thing.  One way or the other there are a few flaws that you must overcome for him to be categorized as "perfect."  I guess were now on the stage of realizing the flaws about each other.  I could honestly say that there are nights before I go to bed that I would be crying myself to sleep not really knowing the real reasons why, but like Minh said that he  hasn't been treating me right.  I keep telling myself that he loves me that's why I should just be patient with him.  Though at times it does hurt to hear some of the things he would say to me or the way he reacts towards me, I know that he means well but his actions and words doesn't coincide what he says, I always find myself at a lost.  I know at times he feels that he really disappoint me and that he wouldn't be surprised that I would leave him someday, in reality, that didn't even occured in my mind at all.  But rather, I know in my heart that I must try harder.  Love really does test your patience, it makes you want to try harder and to give it your best knowing that the person that you're doing it for is really worth it in the end.  I know how good he has and will treat me someday.  Though we go through a turmoil of emotions, in the end that we still have that bond, the love, that keeps us together, to strive to move forward and to make it better.    He came over to my house after he got off work today to talk to me about the article that he shared with me and I gave my input based on our own relationship.  In the past I already noticed that whenever I wanted to open up to him he seems like he doesn't really want to take the time to really listen to what I have to say.  That's the impression I got from him.  There would be times that I would get really hurt about that.  Like about a week ago, when I was telling him about my day when I was talking to him on the phone, and his response was "yeah, whatever."  Then yesterday, I know that I have to take care of my issues regarding UofM and I was telling him my plans for the upcoming year, and he just kept changing the topic as though he didn't really want to hear a word that I have to say.  When I already asked him not to say anything but just please take the time to listen.  Nope, that didn't happen.  It's like he's leaving me out in the cold, and yet he wonders why at times I push him away and that I don't open up to him the way he does with me.  I tried opening up to him, but he never let's me, so what else am I supposed to do.  Just typing these words out is the only way for me to really get through to him.  I just get lost at times, not knowing as to where I should really position myself.  I tried to be the girlfriend that I know that I can be, but at times the worst side of me comes out.  I become irritable, cranky, cold, and unloving at times.  I really don't want to be like that, but at times he brings that side out to me, or I brought it to myself.  I guess I just disappoint myself.  Whenever he tells me something I do listen.  For instance, he kept telling me he wanted to find a new job coz he's not happy with his job, I took the time to make a resume, I searched for jobs for him, but there's only so much that I could do it's up to the person to actually to act upon it.  If he's happy and content to where he is, then I should just leave it alone.  Until he asks for my help then that's the time I will lend him my hand.  I don't want to make him feel like I'm naggin him to change or to do something, if he's to do something it has to be under his own will.  I just have to put my faith in him that everything that he does is for the better and to make us happy.  It will get better, I know that it will...

      Wow, it's been a week since I have last updated my day to day events.  Well after reading what I just wrote last week, about me being sad about my boyfriend, well, I could honestly say within a week time, Minh and I have been more closer now than we ever before.  My parent's left for Europe on Friday and my boyfriend drove my parents to the airport and that alone gave me the feeling that our parents and family can already accept us both into each other's family.  It's this feeling that they can foresee us being together and starting a family of our own.  It's a wondeful feeling.  These past few days has been amazing!  He's been staying with me these past few days, it has been a blissful moments!  Just being around him this much made me realized what kind of a husband he'll be to me someday.  Waking up early in the morning making love and then we would take a shower together, then as I get ready for work he would prepare breakfast for me.  Then he would give me a nice big hug and a big kiss and he would tell me to have a wonderful day at work.  It makes me smile everytime he does that.    Saturday he worked and he came over just a few hours before he went to work.  We made the most of our time together.  Then Sunday morning he came over to see me early in the morning that we ended up missing church.  He took me to Kelsey's for lunch and then we went to get gas for my car and he washed my car for me.  I love those feeling, the simple things that he does for me to show me that he truly does love me.  Then we came back to my house again.  Later on the day we went to visit his dad along with his mom and his sister.  It was a wonderful feeling just to be around his family that day.  His mom invited me over to their house to have supper there and we ate fish, we had fruits for dessert.  Then Minh and I washed the dishes and dried them and put them away afterwards.  Of course, Minh complained about putting the dishes away.  What a guy...  :)   After that we went to McPhilipps Station with his mom.  We were there for three hours then we left her there to pick up his brother at work at 11:00.  I talked to him for a bit asking him about his new job and everything, he seems really excited about his job, I'm really happy for him.  By the time we got home it was already 1:00 in the morning.    Monday, after work I was so tired.  By the time Minh came over we watched a movie and I ended up falling asleep.  I really dozed off that night.  Then yesterday, Tuesday was our 6 months anniversary.  I got all pretty for my man.  I wore my red dress.  He came over and got me one beautiful rose.  I really loved it!  I'm not a big fan of bouquets, once in a while I don't mind it, but I prefer just getting one, and I did!  We went to Colosseo for supper.  After we got home we truly enjoyed each other's company... ;)  Then this morning since I know how much work I have to do for school, I figured that I should take the time to myself.  I need to do some homework and since i have a meeting to go to tomorrow morning I figured that I should get plenty of rest.  So yeah, that's the update of my week.  Until next time!

      Wow, it's been a while since I logged on here and share my intimate thoughts in words. But nevertheless, it's still good for the soul *hehehhe.*    What can I say, it has been a good month for me.  For starter, July is the month of my birthday.  My loving boyfriend spent lot's and lot's of time with me these past few weeks/months and each moments we shared together has been simply amazing.  I love him, that's all I've got to say about that.  As for the other aspect of my life goes, I got a new job with Entegra Credit Union.  Just reflecting back in my life, it's interesting to see how and what I did to get to where I am.  From cleaning washrooms at Burger King, to answering calls in different language (which I claimed to know and speak) on the phone, to taking in deposits and payments over the counter, and now, I'm actually moving towards a managerial position which I hope to be someday.  Something I always wanted to be, and I know in time there's something out there for me, it's just the matter of time.  I could honestly say that right now life is good on my side.  A year ago I was lost, not really knowing what I'm going to do.  But it seems like I have been lifted out of the darkness and everything just fell into place.  Just this evening I was talking with my parents about my future plans of moving out and they were very happy and excited for me.  I felt so relieved that I have my parents support whatever it may be.  I love everything right now.  It's an indescribible feeling.  As of today, and right now, this will be the marking point of a major transition in my life.  This has been the month of change for me.  A whole new journey to embark on.  I'm lovin' it!

         I had the most wonderful week-end well spent with my boyfriend.&nbsp; Friday night I didn't see him coz we spent time apart to be with our own friends.&nbsp; I saw my co-workers and chilled with them.&nbsp; The thought of my honey was on my mind all night long.        &nbsp;    By Saturday&nbsp;the moment I heard a text from him just instantly put a smile on my face.&nbsp; We spent the whole day together at the zoo with Trinity and Jesse.&nbsp; It feels great to&nbsp;be around kids, just watching us&nbsp;being&nbsp;so&nbsp;protective&nbsp;over our the&nbsp;kids, just made me realized that someday we would be parents and we will do our best to make as much time with our own children.&nbsp; Then after that I came to visit him at the store, and to feel him inside of me felt so wonderful.&nbsp; Just to be close to him like that again, it's something really special that I share only with him.         &nbsp;     Then we went to his bbq at his house.&nbsp; To spend time with him and his friends as well as my friends felt really good.&nbsp; It's not often that we get to do that, and when we did do that it felt really nice.&nbsp;        &nbsp;    What amazed me so much, as I was talking to my friend Phoirs yesterday, I was starring at my man and I told her that's my husband.&nbsp; The man that I will marry someday.&nbsp; It's true, the more I look at him each and everyday it becomes more apparent and crystal clear that he's the one sent for me from heaven above.&nbsp; I couldn't be any more happier.&nbsp; Each and every night, I always dream as to how we would live our life together as husband and wife, I just remember smiling a lot now.&nbsp; As I was typing this, I keep on thinking of the songs&nbsp;to play&nbsp;on the night of our wedding. &nbsp;I want to do something special for him.&nbsp; A song that he and his mom could dance to.&nbsp; The song that I have chosen is called "Song for Mama" by Boyz II Men.&nbsp; Another song that I have chosen is called "Music of My Heart" I want to dance to that with my dad and Minh with his mom.&nbsp; I don't know why I'm thinking about all this now, but I guess the exhilirating feeling that I feel right now, is so strong and remarkable that when that day comes it would just simply be magical.&nbsp; I just love him so much!&nbsp; I can't wait until tomorrow comes to start another day with my man, Minh Luke Tran Loves Eileen Chiara Cruz Cabrera&nbsp;Tran to be!&nbsp; ;)  &nbsp;&nbsp;    He deserves every love I can offer each and every day and forevermore.

      Well well, where do I start?  Hmmm, first and most foremost I have to admit, this has been one of the best by far week-end I've ever had!  I went camping with my honey, just us two.  We went to Hecla Island.  What a beautiful place.  We got there on Saturday .  It was a two hour drive and it was a fun drive going there.  By the time we got there we managed to set up our tents and settled in.  We brought edible food but mostly junk.  I made chicken wrap for my boyfriend which he enjoyed eating coz it was made by me.  Then we went for a walk and just checked out the place.  By dinner time we played cards.  Guess who won?  That's right, me again!  *hehhehehe* The "poker queen."  After the game we made sweet love to each other.  That whole week-end was incredibly relaxing and just making the most of each other.  We went to the beach, and enjoyed the sun and just being outdoor.  In the evening time we would play cards and I'm learning as much as I can.  We played strip poker and once again the Poker Queen won the victory.  "For all the glory, baby!"  So guess who got to strip, my sexy boyfriend.  Since I won he got to be my slave.  But in the middle of all that, he did something so incredibly silly that disppointed me in so many ways.  Just the fact that he took it out his hand to make decisions for me for his own benefits didn't quite pleased me.  After that night we talked about it and everything is well between us again.  I'm glad that we have open communication with each other.  This morning before we left the camp ground, we made love to each other once more.  It felt like fireworks everywhere.  I enjoyed every second of it all, seizing every moment.  It was the most pleasurable experienced I ever shared with my sweety.  In summary, it was all good!  Most embarassing moment:  I took a shower with Minh, and when we came out of the shower there were people waiting to get in.  They all just looked at us with awe.  I was humiliated and mortified, while on the other hand my boyfriend came out looking like a stud.  What a guy....
