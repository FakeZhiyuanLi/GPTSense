      It has been so stormy here this summer! Even I almost at the point of saying that I have had my fill of lightning, thunder, and torrential rain. Yet no matter how much I worry about a lightning strike frying my PC despite all surge protectors and such, I can't keep from looking in wonder at these powerful weather events.  Coming home from work on the nineteenth, I got a chance to drive right into a growing storm. With an hour plus commute, it's not unusual for me to have perfectly clear weather at the office, while a storm rages at home. The building clouds were tinged with gold sunlight to the west, highlighting the billows and bulges. I snapped a pic with my camera phone...   urlLink     It was really amazing. Seeing these lovely (and dangerous!) storms remind me how God is the most amazing artist. Every bit of art we make is a little glimmer of that Creativity.

      My boyfriend and I had the best time at Otakon 2004! There's so much to see and learn, and so many fun people. In case you haven't heard about it, Otakon is the biggest Japanese Culture/Anime Convention on the East Coast. Every year, fans come from all around the country to the Baltimore Convention center for the big, 3-day con.   One of my favorite things about the convention is Cosplay. This is where fans create costumes from just about everything (anime, video games, comic, J-rock signers etc.), and wear them at the convention for all to see. WOW! It is amazing to witness the creativity and skills of convention goers on display.  Here is one of the coolest and most creative ones we saw. From the webcomic that ev'rybody loves ( urlLink HomestarRunner.com ): TEEN GIRL SQUAD!   urlLink     I was taken aback by their awesome-nity. ;) It was such a brilliant idea, and very well carried out! I really wish that they would have done a skit for the Masquerade. Click  urlLink here  to see the original Teen Girl Squad collection.

      Well, I finally have my own blog! I wonder if anyone will ever stumble upon it...? This will be my little online home for posting my thoughts and wanderings on the web.   I've taken my blog name is from _Haibane Renmei_ (Translation 'Charcoal Feathers Federation'), one of my favorite anime featuring a haunting story with endearing characters and beautiful settings. By 'haunting' I mean that the events in the story kinda stick with you and make you think. I think I need a new word, since 'haunting' has such a negative connotation.   Bear with me, I will add links and postings as time goes by. Let me know if you have any helpful advice.
