      Well I was really starving after my long run and well I really wanted chinease food so guess what I did?  I ordered chinease food I was home alone and had about 30 bucks from yesterdays trip left over so I used 9 dollas exactly.  I called and the lady asked me where I lived (of course a chinease lady) and then she said near CMW high school and I said yes and then she was like "okai" in her little chinease voice then she paused and said okay so you live in the high school?  I was like laughing at that point and said no and she said do you want it delivered to the high school?  I said no lol. So she finally said so you live in a hous....right?  And I told her yes after about 5 minutes of debating weather I lived in a house or a school she finally said have a nice day and hung up then after 45 minutes of sitting there starving the guy came, he smelt like old feet....I didnt give him a tip.  I forgot sorry.  Then I ate and enjoyed my food, tomorrow is OBX it is going to be ausome. I cannot wait. Cya.

      Hey, I started this blog because everyone has xanaga's and its stupid. Well it's not stupid I just wanted to start my own thing The run this morning was really hard i think it was because of the heat I ran like the whole way except a few times I had to "catch my breath" I came home and drank two cups of water then took a cold shower to calm myself then I was reading my magizine for a while while I rested and stuff, well i woke up at like 11 so I coulnt run when it was cool outside thats why I always run int he morning at like 6 yeah thats damn early but it gets you up and stuff it feels good. My dad was supposed to wake me but didn't and he said I didn't tell him but I really did trust me. Well that's all of my first entry of the "Blogger" life.
