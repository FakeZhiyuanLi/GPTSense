         Today's Babbling      It's grey. It's snowy. And   IT'S FRIDAY!!!  It's time to unwind and get ready for the weekend. OK. So I don't really have a whole lot planned yet. But it's still early! If it snows a lot this weekend, then maybe it's an opportune time to get some skiing in! :) On the other hand, if it's too nasty for that, then maybe take in a movie (been wanting to catch Harry Potter) or do a little shopping (need a new winter jacket).       Some jackets I have been looking at:     urlLink Women's Varius Guide Jacket  and   urlLink  Men's Flight Jacket      I know. One's a woman's jacket and the other is a men's. I find that sometimes the men's jackets fit better on me. I think it's because my shoulders are a bit broader, so a boxier cut is preferable.     Apparently on Sunday, there will be a tree lighting event in my neighborhood. I guess they've decided to put up a big tree in the new market square. It's it's not too bad out on Sunday, I might go check it out. It's a nice community thing to do. Maybe go ski around the golf course (conditions permitting) before the tree lighting.      Holiday Stuff      I don't know about you, but I have not really done much in the way of Christmas shopping yet. I really don't know what to get anyway. At least my brother and I have agreed not to get each other anything this year. Since I won't be able to visit my folks this holiday season I'm not obliged to get them anything. ;-) But I'm sure I'll make up for it at a later date (like at Chinese New Year or something). We will, however, be visiting my boyfriend's parents for a few days. But at least there we have agreed on a certain budget. This way no one will be breaking the bank. But what to get for my boyfriend? Hmmmm....     Anyway......

         Today  What can I say?  It's relatively sunny right now with a few clouds.  Would that constitute "mostly sunny"?  Anyway....  Today was the day of the big parade for the Montreal Alouettes.  I'm not much of a football fan, but I still think it's great that they won the Grey Cup.  I believe that the last time they won the Grey Cup was back in 1977.  So, as the parade was set for noontime, I figure I'd check it out via one of the webcams found at  urlLink Montreal Cam .  And lo and behold there was that sea of people waiting along St.Catherine Street.  Eventually around 12:38PM, the convoy with the players came by.  Right behind the last vehicle was a sea of people following them to the end of the parade (St.Catherine and McGill College).  Afterwards, I decided to check in on the penguins at the Biodome. :)   Blergh!  I think I might be coming down with something.  I've had a bit of a headache since last night and it doesn't seem to want to go away.  Also, right after lunch I wanted to sleep so badly. I must be exhausted or something.  And I really do hope I am not coming down with a cold! :-p  They're forecasting some snow for this weekend and it would be crappy if I got sick and go out and play in the snow. :-p  Maybe I'll just get some more tea and settle in for the night when I get home...

         Today's Rant  If you drive, then this is a rant for you!  Have you ever noticed that the more expensive the vehicle the bigger the jerk that's behind the wheel?  I have noticed that whenever there are jerks making bonehead manoeuvres on the road (i.e., passing on the right on a residential street and blowing stop signs), they almost always seem to be driving some luxury car like a BMW or a Mercedes-Benz.  Now why is that?  Is it because they can afford such a car that it gives them the license to drive however they want?  What I don't think they realize is that doing 80km/hr and blowing every stop sign on a residential street  will one day come back to haunt them!  In a discussion on this subject, a colleague made note of another *sshole on his street who just HAD to get somewhere fast.  So, in order to do so he sped up and passed a school bus just as it was about to stop for a pick up.  And guess what kind of car he drove?  Yup! You guessed it.  A BMW.    Now, don't get me wrong here.  I don't want to say that ALL luxury car drivers are jerks.  It's just that so far the ones that I have seen tend to be the more obnoxious drivers.  I won't say that I'm a perfect driver, but I certainly won't drive in a way that might endanger others!   In other news  There's not a whole lot else to comment at this point.  I could get onto the subject of the problems in the Middle East, but then that would lead into a discussion on politics and religion. And, well, I'm just not in the mood for that right now.  It's a bit heavy for aTuesday night.   Shopping  I read an article in today's Gazette about the Christmas shopping season.  It made note of the largest mall in the region (Carrefour Laval). It talked about the shoppers and the shopkeepers.  It discussed how crazy some shoppers are when it came to finding parking spaces and shopping within the mall in general.  I've been to Carrefour Laval before they recently expanded.  And even before they expanded, I found it to be a very busy and crowded place.  It's a bit too busy and crowded for my tastes.  I think that this season, whatever shopping I need to do for this Christmas I will try to get done either downtown or on-line! :)   urlLink Indigo.ca   urlLink Future Shop   Anyhoo, I don't think I have a whole lot to shop for this season as I do not plan on visiting my folks this year.  I've gone down there about 4 times this year, I think they can handle not seeing me this Xmas.  On the other hand, it looks like I will be heading in the other direction and visiting the folks of my significant other.  I don't think we plan on making it a very expensive Xmas, so shopping shouldn't be that difficult.   New Year's Celebrations  Received some propaganda in the mail today for the development I live in.  It's just a small collection of flyers put together by the development.  One is a letter wishing us all a happy holiday season.  It also mentions the cross-country skiing that is being offered on the golf course and what the "rules" are (basically, check the hours and no night skiing).  There's also mention of a skating rink near the clubhouse.  Also, there is supposed to be an official lighting of the Christmas tree at the marketplace this coming Sunday.  If I don't have anything better to do, maybe I will check it out.  Also in the envelope is a flyer advertising a New Year's Eve party.  $150 per person will get you an open bar, dinner and champagne to ring in the New Year.  I think that's a bit steep for me.  I think I will just go out and get my own bottle of champagne  and celebrate the New Year in the comforts of  my home and with my loved ones. :)  Cheers!

        Fonts Galore  Let's try another font for a change. I need to exercise a bit of creativity here instead of just settling for defaults. :)   I came across an interesting weblog of an American currently living in Japan. I found it while doing a  urlLink Google  search on this lovely japanese breakfast food called  urlLink  natto  .  There's also some non-Japanese related tidbits at this site.  Anyone want to buy a  urlLink splicer ?  Please make a really good bid on it! Good stuff is hard to come by these days! :D   Other babblings  It seems that as we grow older time seems to be going by that much faster.  Why is that?  (Rhetorical question)  Ya know.. since I am writing this blog on the cheap, I have no idea how many people have visited my blog.  Therefore, it would be nice to know who (if there is a who) out there has viewed this.  A simple blank email will suffice.  Or, if you really want, you can say hi or something. :D  I know my writings may not be the most exciting in the world, but hey, you never know when one day I will be so inspired that I might actually end up writing some masterpiece!  Uhm.. yeah. Right.  ;-)

       Wacky, wacky Weather  First it snows (Monday).  Then it rains (today).  Next, it's suppose to snow again.  Has Mother Nature gone schitzophrenic on us?  But then again, I suppose that this is typical autumn/pre-winter weather.  I guess I just got so used to the nice summer weather this year that I am still in some sort of sub-conscious denial.  But, whatcha gonna do?   Other stuff  Thanksgiving in the US is next week.  I don't even remember the last time I have gone home for Thanksgiving.  Maybe next year.  We'll see.  I mean, there is Thanksgiving here in Canada, but it's just not quite the same here, especially in Quebec.  Sure, we get a day off, but it's on a Monday.  Sure, we can have turkey with all the trimmings, but the weather outside is still a bit balmy.  Oh the weather out there is frightful...  And so are the drivers!   Current Rant  OK, so several topics have been running around my head this past week so I will just pick one: Right on Red.  This is a subject that has been debated upon for some time now here in Quebec.  Earlier this year they decided to trial this in some parts of Quebec (except for the major urban areas like Montreal).  In general, everything seems OK.  There doesn't seem to be a significant change in number of accidents.  So now it seems that they will make it legal to turn right on red in the province.  HOWEVER, in Montreal, it would be up to the local government here to decide if they want to institute the right-on-red policy.  So far, there have been hearings and discussions about it.  It seems that the general consensus here is NO. No right-on-red on the island of Montreal.  If you think about it, it's probably for the best.  I have been here long enough to see just how bad the drivers are around here.  Hell, I was a victim of it last year!     Story  Last year around this time, I had just had my winters put on and my car waxed and buffed and ready for winter.  So there I was heading into work as usual.  I came to light at an intersection close to work.  The light was red.  When the light turned green, I started to enter the intersection.  Then all of a sudden, I see this white car bearing down on me from the other street!  *CRUNCH*  He nails me on the front passenger side.  I was in shock.  I managed to get out of the car.  I tried to remain calm and collected.  I asked the guy what the hell he was doing!  Do you know what his response was???  "The light was yellow, so I sped up."  WHAT THE #$*(&*?????  What the hell do you mean you sped up???  Were you a whole fricking block away when you sped up????  I was just absolutely flabbergasted!   (BTW, I did not use those expletives at the time, but the comments were running around my head).  Anyway, I went ahead and took out the form we would need to fill out for insurance purposes.  I dont think this guy has ever seen one of these forms, so he was clueless and I had to tell him what he needed to fill out.  Afterwards, I managed to drive the car into the garage at work.  Then I called my insurance company to tell them about the accident and faxed them the form. Next, I took the car to a body shop nearby that was recommended by my dealer (it was only a block or so away from work).  As my insurance covers for loss of use, I set up for a rental.  I ended up with a gold-colored Toyota Echo (ick!).  Later on, I hear back from my insurance guy about when the estimate was going to be done.  Also, he checked with the other guy's insurance company and it seems that he never filed his copy of the report.  I guess that means he didnt want to claim anything to have his car fixed.  It also indicates that he was at fault. Anyway, my care was the more damaged of the two.  Anyhoo.. After about a week, I finally get my baby back.  All in one piece!  Since then I have been somewhat more leary about crossing intersections after the light changes.  Oh well.

       Brrrrrrr!  It seems that winter has really decided to set in.  The temps have dropped.  It's snowing.  And it's windy!  Went out for a walk to the bakery yesterday for a baguette and nearly froze my arse off!  I really did not think that the windchill was THAT bad!  Oh well.  Went out for a coffee and cake early but this time got smart and bundled up a bit more warmly.  The downside to the walk was when the ice pellets (yes, there's ice pellets out there right now) hits your face.  It stings somewhat!  Anyhoo-hoo... It looks like it will snow some more tonight and tomorrow.  After that the temps might start to go up again and instead of snow, it might rain instead!  Whoopeee!!  What a lovely mess this will make outside! :)  Oh well.  At least I have my winter tires on!    Listening to:  A CD mix of various music.  Currently, the Beatles' "Ticket to Ride".   Under the category of  Strange Conversations ...  The other day, a bunch of us work were just chatting away at nothing in particular when the conversation fell on the topic of cockrings.  Now, I HONESTLY don't remember HOW we got onto the subject, but in any case.. In a room of 4 women and 1 man, we were discussing the issue of cockrings and how they are supposed to be applied.  First of all, the guy has never used one before but was curious about it and was wondering how one would "wear" one.  Basically, he cannot fathom how something that size can be applied to *ahem* something so large (I don't think there was a whole lost of modesty here).  One of us believed that it had to be put on before the climactic act.  I seconded that theory and, being the geek that I am, even went on to explain why it should be applied well before any sort of arousal occurs.  The gentleman still did not believe it.  However, he said he'll let us know Monday if he managed to wear it according to what theory. ;-)  We shall soon find out! ;-)

       Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows  Yes, for once it's a sunny day here in Montreal.  However, I don't think it will last very long.  Latest weather forecast indicates rain by this afternoon. :-p  Oh well.  No more waiting (sort of).  I think I know what my place in life will be.  As long as it's interesting, I don't mind. :)  Hungry.  Need lunch soon.  Darn.  It's only 11:20AM.  What shall I have for lunch today?  Was a bit too lazy to pack a lunch from home. :-p  Japanese course is tonight.  I really should do a little bit of studying during my lunch hour.  Ah, we'll see. :)

       More babbling  What more can I say? I am what I am and that's the way it's gonna be. Can't do anything about it and if you've got a problem with that well then you're gonna have hell to pay!   OK, so that was a bit of nonsensical ranting there.  Brain tired. Typing tired.  Fingers want to go to sleep.  Zzzzzzzzzz.  Problems with the metro system here this afternoon it seems.  Of course, it just had to happen just as everyone is leaving for the day to go home.  And out they came from the metro station.  A steady stream of people fed up with waiting for the system to come back up and bring them home.  They all line up at the one bus stop.  The one bus stop where the bus comes by every 25-30 minutes.  I guess it's a good thing that it's not that cold today.  I think it was around +4C this evening during rush hour.  I think that little spate of Indian Summer we had recently is now no more.  Ah well, c'est la vie.   Currently listening to:   urlLink CHOM Radio

       Musings of the day  It's always good to be busy working on something.  Sometimes you may not necessarily *like* what you're doing, but who usually does if it's related to work, right?  In any case, I'm usually happy if I'm busy doing something productive.  The skies are slowly starting to clear.  This is a good sign.  I hope that it will be relatively clear next week for viewing the Leonids!  I've been wanting to catch sight of a meteor shower!  Must remember: French fries are bad for you.  Salad is good for you!  We are barely mid-November and already they are putting up the Christmas lights for the building here at work.  It's TOO EARLY!!!  But, alas, what can be done about that?  Right on red in Montreal?  The jury is still out on this one.    Re-instituting toll-booths in Montreal?  Why not?  It would help off-set the cost of the yearly roadwork, which in turn should decrease the budget allocated for roadwork, which in turn should lower our income taxes.... Hmmm.... Maybe this will even force people to make use of the efficient public transit system that is so readily available here?  Now, I've been to other places and tolls are not necessarily an evil thing.  In Boston, they are using the money collected from the tolls to fund the Big Dig project.  In New Hampshire, there is a toll on Interstate 93.  I assume that this toll is used towards the maintenance of the roads.  Also, there is a toll on the Mass. Turnpike.  I think that as long as we know where exactly that money is going, it can't be that bad (unless they say that the money is going straight into the politician's pocket...).  Funny how "Little Bunny Foo Foo" became "Little Bunny Frou Frou". ;-)

       Current Vibes   urlLink CN Soho Live    Cats and Chicken  Why is it that cats (at least the ones that I've lived with) have this thing for chicken?  Whenever I have chicken for supper, it seems that they KNOW when you have chicken for supper.  They hover around the table like vultures HOPING that a piece of lovely cooked chicken would fall their way.  Hungry little feline piggies! ;-)   Time to unwind and chill out to some funky vibes.

       Evening Babble  So, like I've been telling a few people about my blog.  Just a few people.  My brother, a few co-workers.  I know that this blog has been earmarked as public, but just who really just happens upon it?  Hmmm... I wonder.  It's so nice to be home after a day at the office (not that I was working hard or anything).  It's just nice to come home and be greeted by hungry cats who want nothing more than a clean litter box, food, water and the occasionaly pat on the head or scratch behind the ears.  Time to kick back, relax and have a nice drink or cocktail before supper.  Afterwards, maybe catch up on some reading or watch a bit of TV or a video.  Time to push anything work-related out of mind and relax.   Babbles from a Feline  Meow. Meow mreow mew mew meow!  Meow?   Meeeow mewwww mew mew mreow mreowww. Mreow. Mreow mreow meow meow mew mew meow. Mew mreow, mew mew meow meow meow mreow mew.  Mreow?!  Mew mew mew mew!  Mreow. Meow.  mrew?!   Back to the human  OK, so I just HAD to let him tap in a few words.  I'll have to find a bablefish if this keeps up! ;-)  But he had better keep those hairballs to himself!  Ewwww.  Ever had to clean up after a hairball hack?  Not a pretty sight.  Oh well.  At least cats make for a nice hot water bottle at night!  Just remember to trim their claws. ;-D

       Darkness Falls  It's amazing how the change in seasons affects our general environment.  Take autumn for example.  After a few months of long summer days and sunsets after 8:00pm, all of a sudden we start to see the sun rise well after 7AM and setting before we even leave the office.  Now how depressing is that?  Before long, winter will set in and the snow will start to fall.  You get up in the morning, it's dark.  You come back home from work, it's dark.  The only daylight you see is out your office window, that is, if you are lucky enough to have an office with a window.  Such are the doldrums and humdrum days of winter.   Current Status  Waiting....   Current Mood  Ever so patiently waiting...

       Waiting  Why are we put through this?  We wait in line.  We wait for news.  We wait for our food.  Always watiing.  Always waiting for something to happen.  I suppose it's just a fact of life that inevitably we have to wait for something.  No matter how much we try to avoid waiting, it happens.    You try to get there early so you can be the first one in line.  However, you still end up waiting because the clerk isn't ready yet.  You try to get there before the lunch time rush hits, but you still have to wait because the tables aren't set yet.  You want to hear about your job interview, but the hiring manager is out of town for a few days.  Inevitably we all have to wait. *thumb twiddling*    So, just how many minutes or hours are lost waiting?  Can someone tell  me?

       Weather  Cloudy (again). Temperature around +6C.  Still mild.   Babble  Blah!  It's 8:55AM EST.  What more do you want from me?  Had my cups of coffee already.  Waiting for the caffeine to kick in.  I hate having to turn on the lights in the office because fluorescent lighting is just terrible on the eyes.  It's either that or sit in a dark office.  It's not so bad on the sunny days. Oh?  So you think it's nice to have an office with a window?  All I see is traffic go by and people coming out from a subway station.     View outside  I see a person distributing what looks to be one of the free dailies.  There are a few daily newspapers that are currently being distributed for free in the subway system here.  One of them is Metro.  I believe that this may have originated in Europe somewhere as I have seen it in the Stockholm subway system.  It looks like an interesting enough newspaper, but unfortunately, I can't read Swedish.  It's in French here, so that's not a big problem.  There's also another free daily, but I can't remember the name of it.  It came out around the same time Metro was first introduced here.  Hm... No Ferrari's going by. Wait! They just brought out a nice silver convertible.  *sigh* Something to look at at least!   Listening to:   urlLink Ministry of Sound Radio

       The Weather that was today  Cloudy. Rain in the AM. Sunny breaks. Windy.  High of about 16C.   Things of note  Not much really.  Got up.  Went to work.  Tried to figure out my role in the grand scheme of things at work.  Of course, anyone I wanted to talk to was not around for one reason or another.  I think it's all a conspiracy.  They don't really want to give me real work.  They just want me to wander the corridors of work for all eternity!  Yeah!  That's it!  That's why I hardly get any email any more.  I have been virtually erased!  What am I to do?  Am I becoming paranoid?  Will I soon become delusional?  Must have some more coffee.  Must make a fresh pot of coffee.  Sugar!  Need more sugar!  What?  Is it already lunchtime?  I look at my watch.  Yay!  It's almost time to go home!  What have I accomplished today?  BUPKISS!!!   Hints of sanity   (This space left intentionally blank.)   Other things of interest  Rosie hints of sunset amongst scary clouds. Bright yellow Ferrarri convertible driving by. Swarms of seagulls flying by. Fallen leaves on big wet piles.

         Xmas Shopping  Have *YOU* started your holiday shopping yet?  I don't think I have yet.  I'll probably stop by the mall this week.  I don't think I have the patience or the energy to even think about doing this sort of shopping on the weekend!  I'd rather be doing other things than to wrestle through a crowd!   Photo Ops  I loaded up my little Olympus Trip 35 camera the other day with a roll of color print film.  I originally hoped to take a few shots while I was up north on Sunday, but as I was busy trying to get up from falling down in the snow, taking photos that day was an act in futility.  I was just too busy ensuring that I stayed upright! 8-)  Work Blah Blah Blah  Nothing too exciting at work.  I'm trying to organize a Christmas lunch of sorts for some folks at work.  It will basically be a bunch of us who have worked together for the past few years until the most recent restructuring.  I figured that since we're all buddy buddy that we'd get together, have some lunch and swap some gifts.  It's a bring-your-own-lunch type of affair so it cuts down on the amount of organizing required.   Today's Weather  OK, so I'm something of a weather nut.  There's something about it that fascinates me.  In any case, it started out pretty frigid out there this morning sine the temps had dipped last night.  But it seems to have warmed up now and it should be bearable the rest of the week. Ahhhh... no need to make a dash from the car to the door! :)  I just hope it decides to snow a bit more.  I would like to do some more skiing, especially on the golf course.  I need to really practice my technique!  Th-th-that's all folks! 8-)

         Brrrr!  Went up north to do a little cross-country skiing this morning.  The temps in the AM were not so bad, just a shade below 0C.  The conditions weren't too bad, despite the alternating warming and cooling weather.  Did some snowshoeing in parts where it was just a tad too difficult for me to do on skis.  Overall, not a bad day.  In the end, I was aching a little bit (mainly in the knees), but I think it was well worth it.  Now the temps have been dropping throughout the evening.  It's suppose to get down to about -19 tonight! :-p   Totoro  Picked up the DVD for Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro).  It's dubbed in English, but hey, for $13 who can complain?  It's a cute Miyazake movie from around 1987.  Great kids' movie. :)  Tonari no  urlLink TOTORO TOTORO  TOTORO TOTORO...  :-D   Jacket  Finally settled on The North Face "Talkeetna".  Not a bad jacket.  Fairly windproof.  It comes with a zip-out polar.  Kept me dry today! :D

         BLAH!  It's such a gray day today.  It's not frigid.  It's not snowing.  It's not even raining.  This is the sort of weather that makes you want to stay in bed.  I wouldn't mind that. It sure beats a day at the office.  OK, so it is Friday after all.  You still have to wait until you've done your hours before you can go home and start your weekend!   Hmm.  I guess there won't be much of an opportunity to do much cross-country skiing this weekend if there's not much snow.  Not listening to tunes at the moment....

I don't usually ogle such studs, especially if I'm with my guys! 8-)   Current vibes   Listening to Ministry of Sound at the moment.  It seems that Thursdays are rather lively over there with a DJ spinning and bantering and reading emails out at the same time. :D  Rather amusing at times. :)   Weather  Hmm.  It seems that things are starting to warm up a little bit, somewhat.  Maybe a hint of snow.  I hope it's not too frigid this weekend.

          Comments  Normally, I don't like to discuss politics.  Discussions in this arena have a tendency of creating new enemies.  However, I came across this in the news.  Have things really gotten so out of hand that it's now "shoot first, ask questions later"?  You be the judge.   urlLink 95 yr. old Palestinian woman shot by IDF   Just how many more innocent lives will be lost in the name of religion?   Other things  It's still cold.  It's bloody cold!  And it's only early December!  Yes, I will probably continue to whine about the cold weather.  I just have to remember that when the temps hit 30+ in the summer that I should not complain! ;-)   urlLink Local Forecast   The Ferraris are back!  It seems that the dealer may have just cleared the showroom out to do some cleaning up (ergo the big dumpster).  Ahhhh!  Something nice to look at.  Although in this weather I doubt they will park many of them outside. :(

          Brrrrr!  OK. So it seems that Old Man Winter has decided to rear his cold, ugly head a bit earlier than usual.  We're barely into December and we're already experiencing sub-freezing temps and wicked windchills!  Today's high is supposed to be about -11C but we're currently at -14 with a windchill of about -23C!  BRRRRRR!   What do do when it's this cold?  Stay in a nice warm environment!  If you've got a fireplace, use it! ;-)  Nice warm foods like soups are great in keeping the body warm and comfy.  Just had lunch (chicken curry and rice), so I am satiated and warm for the while.  Had 3 coffees this morning because I was still feeling the chill!   Ferrari  *SIGH* It seems that the Ferrari dealership across the street is either closed or about to undergo some renovations.  Or maybe they are closed for the winter?  That probably would make more sense.  Who would want to drive a Ferrari in this cold, wintry weather?  We'll see in the Spring.   Cold  Did I mention how cold it is out there?  I don't think we usually get these temps until January or something. It seems that winter started early here.  I hope that with an early winter, an early spring would come of it!   I hope so!

        Yeah, it's been a while since I last wrote something of any significance here.  Either I've been too lazy, too tired, or just haven't thought about it.  Take your pick.  Today, I figure I should write something.  Yes, I do feel guilty for not making an entry here even though I suspect that very few people read this. :)  Anyway, it's been colder than a witch's tit in a brass bra around here as of late! BRRR!!!  We had a "break" in the cold weather this past weekend when the temperature actually got about -10C!!  Yes!  I was starting to consider that virtually tropical after we went through -40C windchills last week!  Anyway, we didn't come out of that short deep-freeze unscathed!  Some of our water pipes froze as a result. :-p  Thank goodness nothing burst!  That would have been messy and expensive!  In any case, after a little over 24 hours after discovering that we were without hot water, we managed, with minimum of destruction, to regain the use of hot water!! Yipeee!!!  Latest news?  I'll be off to Dallas for a month for work.  Well, not so much work but for a transfer of knowledge.  From the Customs/Immigration point of view, I'm there to learn.  And this is true.  I don't know how they do their stuff, so that's why I'm heading down there to learn all about it.  A month living out of a hotel room.  At least I won't be alone down there.  Some colleagues are aleady down there learning other bits and pieces of stuff.  Anyway... must think about food!!! YUM!! :)

      First day back to work after a 2 week holiday.  It's pretty dead here.  At least it's almost lunch time! :)  I haven't received one new email since I got in this morning.  I wonder if other people are still away for the holidays.  In any case, things need to pick up soon in my area.  We've got a tight deadline.  I need to re-new my passport.  It expired back in September, but I hadn't had the chance to fill out the forms for it.  Anyway, if I am expected to travel anytime soon then I had best get cracking!  The weather today is kinda grey but not too grey.  It's probably what they would call mostly cloudy.  They're forecasting some flurries for today and a high of about -2C.  Blah!  I guess that's it for now.

         Christmas is Over!!!!  Thank goodness!  Not that I don't like Christmas, but who really needs all the stress that comes with this particular holiday?  There's the shopping, the cooking, the baking, the planning.  Then there's the travelling (when applicable).  Whether it's by car, train or plain, no one really likes to travel during the holidays.  This year was no exception.   On the Road again  This year, the Christmas destination was Ontario.  It's about a 7 hour drive along the not-so-scenic Highway 401.  Very long.  Very boring.  Check out the highway on Mapquest and you'll see just how straight and boring it is.  Nothing but fields.  The road is relatively straight, so it's easy to get bored and nod off (not a good thing).  It's not bad as long as you have someone with you (to share the boring drive) and some music.   I'm dreaming of a white Christmas...  We lucked out this year in that the Niagara region was hit with a small snow storm early Christmas morning.  We were fortunate that the drive in was clear and sunny.  When we woke up Christmas morning, we saw nothing but white outside.  It really makes it seem like that long 7 hour drive was worth it!  It was still snowing a bit when we got up.   Land of Mau's  Ever seen an Egyptian Mau?  Cute kitties. Really cute and cuddly if they have been properly socialized.  They just want to cling to you!   New Year's Resolutions  None.  Why make them if you can't keep them? ;-)  C'est tout pour maintenant!

         Managers  I am not a manager myself, but I have gone through a number of them in my time.  This is not as a result of my changing jobs.  This is as a result of numerous re-orgs, re-structuring and managers moving into other areas.  I've had different types of managers, some were great, some ineffective, and some who love meetings.  Today, I found that a colleague's manager is just NOT a very good people person.  And on top of that, this manager does not seem to act very professionally.  He basically tells this colleague that he was lying about the hours he was reporting on an activity based on heresay from another party.  Now, what gets me is that this manager just inherited some people into his group about 2 weeks ago.  Did he have any idea what these people were working on?  Did he make any effort to at least talk to each of the "new" people to see what they were working on and what they're responsibilties are.  During the bit of turmoil we had at my home office, my then manager at some point acquired one whole group.  This brought his section to over 50 people.  But he managed to make time to at least meet with each and every individual to see what they were working on and what concerns they might have with all that was going on.  This other manager, on the other hand, not only tells my colleague that he was lying about his hours but he was also telling him that he was losing his job in April.  Like DUH, I think just about everyone at this location knows that.  So why bother to state the obvious?  Was this a scare tactic? In any case, this was very unprofessional, in my opinion.  Anyway, that's my beef on that subject.   Texas Update  Well, it seems that the weather has decided to get wet today.  Not a big deal.  At least the temps are on the mild side.  I think it's more or less been in the 50-60F range.  Been working hard to cover as much stuff as possible at work.  I am really hoping that I can sufficiently cover what I need to cover by the end of next week.  The only glitch has to do with this other thing that just kind of came up during a meeting on Tuesday.  I'm not exactly sure what they want me to do, but I'm hoping to read up on some stuff I printed.  Maybe I can at least get some idea of the material.  I would like to at least try to do some homework on a subject first if possible.  Anyway, I think that's enough babbling for today.

        Well, I've managed to survive my first weekend here in Texas, more or less.  Saturday, I went over to the Dallas Galleria.  It's a pretty big mall with some swanky stores.  As its main attraction, there is even an ice skating rink.  Overall, I found the mall to be fairly average.  I mean, you have your usual mall stores like the Gap, Victoria's Secret, The Body Shop, just to name a few.  That's why I found it average.  At some point I stopped to grab a bite to eat at Subway.  I took a seat at a table that overlooked the skating rink.  I found it rather amusing to see so many Texans trying to skate.  I could see that there are some kids who are taking lessons and are serious about figure skating.  Then you have the bunch of kids who obviously have not skated much and are more or less shuffling their way around the rink.  I have not skated in years, so I'm sure I'd take a few spills if I got out onto the ice again.  So, what did I do for a few hours at the mall?  Let's see... I got myself a sweater that was on sale at the Gap.  I found some Richard Feynman books at the one bookstore there.  I picked up one CD.  A set of small headphones. A small Dilbert Calendar.  Sudafed.  A present for my sweetie (which I will not describe here).  Today, I mainly vegged.  Did a load of wash so I had some clean cloths.  Read some.  Napped.  Watched some TV.  Chatted with people online.  Really not a heck of a whole lot.  Did not bother to have the room picked up, which was OK by me.  Not like I'm a big slob or anything.  :-)  Anyway... I think that's all there is worth noting...

        It's still rather cool today.  Then it started to rain this afternoon.  By the time I got out of work, it was raining rather steadily, not heavy, but it was raining.  It seems that the drop in the telecom market has hit this region fairly hard as well.  Here in Telecom Corridor, many of your big name telecom companies have laid off hundred of people over the past year or so.  It's rather depressing.  At the height of the industry, it was quite busy here.  The parking lots were full.  The area restaurants were packed at lunch.  We went out to lunch at a chinese restaurant not far from the office.  Apparently, that place used to be packed all the time.  Now it's not even half full.  These are not high times anymore.  Anyway, enough with the depressing stuff.  Hmmm... What else is happening?  I dunno.  There's still talk on the news about the space shuttle.  More home videos of the shuttle starting to break up before it got over Texas.  Which could very well likely mean that the break up started to occur soon after the last communications between the shuttle and mission control.  Well....

        Howdy all loyal readers... That's right, all two of you.  What?  Membership has dropped?  We're down to one and a half?  Oh dear.  Something must be done to rectify this.  So it's still relatively mild here in sunny Richardson, TX.  today started a little on the chilly side with the temps hovering around 1C.  Of course cold is all relative to where you're coming from! ;-)  The temps did rise during the day to a high of about 54F or so.  Everything is done BIG here.  The cars are BIG.  The coffees are BIG. The plates are BIG.  The subs are BIG.  BIG BIG BIG BIG!  I guess that's because this is a big state so everything has to be BIG. ;-)  Hotel living... Gotta love a place that has high-speed connection for free.  They prob got a good package deal with some ISP like AT&T Broadband or something.  Nice to kick back with a bottle of beer (Sam Adams my choice) and catch up on some email or something.  Chatting with some friends is always a nice thing to do too.  This is especially so if you want to rub in the fact that it's warmer here than it is there! :D  Another thing of note around here (State-side) is that there is still a lot on the news about the Space Shuttle Columbia.  It's almost non-stop news about this.  Sometimes you just get a little tired of it, but at the same time you have no choice but to have some sort of feelings about the loss.  But PLEASE, don't over do it.  The chatter here at the bar is rather interesting on the subject. :)  Well....

        Let's try another font.  I like fonts.  Well, what seemed like a routine machine became tragedy.  I was just zapping through the channels this afternoon when I came across a CNN newsfeed on WGN.  I found that unusual so I watched it for a little while.  At first, I wasn't sure what they were talking about exactly other than that it was related to the space shuttle.  Then it dawned at me that something very terrible had happened.  It seems that something had gone horribly wrong as the shuttle was making their way back to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  The shuttle and its crew are lost.  It's rather difficult to believe that such a thing can still happen after the Challenger disaster, but one has to bear in mind that space travel and exploration is still in its infancy (relatively speaking).  Anyone who wants to become an astronaut and be a part of space history should realize what the risks are.  Haven't we all seen enough science fiction television and movies to realize that things do happen?  I think that overall we have been relatively fortunate in the number of tragic accidents since the induction of the space program.  I don't know if it has ever been publicized, but I would imagine that even the Soviet space program had its ups and downs as well, we just don't know about them.  In any case, I feel that after such an event, we should still move forward.  The loss of such fine astronauts is terrible, but they knew the risks.  And it's been mentioned that since shuttle missions have become routine that people don't even know or even pay attention to who the crew is.  I think in some way this is a tragedy in itself.  Well, in other news... Finally, there is a break in the weather.  The temperature here has finally risen to more bearable levels!  It was warm enough that there was some melting snow happening!  Also, tonight, we took a walk around the neighborhood after dinner.  I missed doing that when the weather was just too cold.  Anyhooo.....

Rant 2  *sing* I want sunshine... on a cloudy day.... OK, honestly?  Can't really complain considering that the temps ARE finally above the freezing mark!  Anyway... back to the grind.

I like the fact that it's small, lightweight and quite compact.  I think these guys are better than MP3 players! :D  Just thought I'd share this. :-))

        It's finally summer here in Montreal.  After a rather cold, wet spring, things have started to heat up around here.  Lately, the temps have been in the high 20's, sometimes getting above 30.  Of course this means that it's hot, hazy and humid.  Quite to contrast to the winter temps we got this past season.  Anyway, made a trip down to Boston a couple weekends ago.  It wasn't too painful.  The weather could have been better, but what can you do.  While it was around 30 up here, it was around 20 and pissing rain the Sunday we were down there.  Didn't do too much other than some shopping and stuff.  Of course, being away meant that the cats had a break in their usual routine.  Finster went to the vet for boarding while the others got  checked in on by a friend.  When we came back, Finster was none the worse for wear but Tama seems to be slightly off her food since we weren't around to give her her daily dose of canned food.  As a result, she's lost a little wait.  For a Siamese, that means she's skinnier than usual.  We will have to try to entice her back to the canned food as she just doesn't eat enough of the dry kibble.  I am trying to make an effort to cycle to work.  I first cycled to work last Monday when a lot of people had taken that day off (Tuesday was a holiday).  It wasn't too bad.  Still got to get over my fear of crossing the larger intersections.  I should consider leaving my laptop at home.  It was a killer ride home with that load on my back!  I will see about riding in tomorrow morning.  I will try to do the Mon-Wed-Fri ride in.  At least that would be a start!  Started a small garden on the deck this year.  It's mainly various types of plants in planters.  Got some impatiens going in planters on the rails.  I've got a mix of verbena, viola, geranium, oxalis, fuschia, snapdragons and coleus in some planters on the floor.  Nice colorful assortment.  Next season I hope to do better as far as how to plant the different plants in a btter manner.  I've also got two cherry tomato plants that Dave's mom gave me.  They seem to be doing well and are starting to bear fruit!  I also have a cucumber plant that's flowering now.  I wonder if those will bear fruit!  The cucumber I had attempted to start from seed.  First attempt and they're flowering!  Not a bad start. :)  Anyway, let's see how I keep up with my blog. ;-)

      Well, I just got my new toy yesterday: an iBook.  It's the Spring 2002 model (so, yeah, it's second-hand).  It's got the 700Mhz G3 processor, 384MB RAM, combo drive, and airport card.  The package came with the airport hub and Jaguar as well!  Overall, it's a pretty good deal.  We played with it a bit yesterday.  Had to flash the airport hub with the new network configuration. Decided to do a clean install and away we go! :)  OK, so I'm still blogging from the PC, but soon enough I will be doing it from the iBook.  It's kinda neat to be able to surf wirelessly! :D  A nice sunny Sunday morning here.  Will probably go over to Jasmin Nursery with Dave's mom.  See what there is on sale at this time of year. :-)  Ciao for now!

      A bit has happened since last entry.  Sunday, we had to send Tama off to a happier place.  She was just going down hill.  Last week, her appetite for the smelly mixture of canned cat food, cat milk and baby food was waning.  She was also drinking a lot and peeing a lot.  Saturday, we had only managed to get her to eat once.  Sunday, she just flat out refused.  So we called the vet.  We were lucky they were able to see her.  We brought her to the vet.  The vet checked her out.  She had lost at least a pound since her visit in March.  He checked out her teeth and found that she had a few sores.  If it was painful for her to eat, this was the reason.  Dental surgery would be one possibility.  However, before we even consider that route, the vet suggested a blood test to see if there wasn't anything else wrong.  We said OK.  We left Tama there and they would call us within an hour.  The call came and they wanted us to come in. We got there and the prognosis was not good.  The blood test results indicate kidney failure. :-(  This would explain her lack of appetite and drinking habits.  There were options, but were they viable options?  Would it have been fair to us or Tama if we tried to prolong her life?  She's managed to live this long with her chronic upper respiratory problem.  We both think it's time to say good bye and let her go to a happier place where she won't have to worry about getting pilled, where she can get all the attention she wanted.  It was difficult, but we saw her once last time before the vet did the deed.  It was certainly a rough Sunday afternoon.  After this, I do hope it will be some time to come before one of the other guys take a turn.  Finster is now 12 years old an diabetic.  Jum is next at about 8.  BS is about 5-6.  They all seem to be in good health.  We'll probably have to have BS's teeth looked at after the vet told us about how Siamese tend to be predisposed to bad teeth.  BS enjoys his food.  Let's hope he can enjoy it for some time to come!  Anyway... enough of the depressing diatribe.

      It's 4:30AM.  Is your cat being fed?  We must have one of the most fussiest cats in the world.  Her name is Tama.  She's a lilac-point Siamese.  She's got a chronic upper respiratory infection.  And her food has to be just right.  :-p  Her current formula is a mixture of regular canned catfood (no beef or seafood) mixed with Whiskas catmilk and baby food (meat puree).  Blend that together with a hand blender and Voila!  You've got yourself instant kitty slop.  Oh! It must also be at room temperature.  I would like to go back to bed now.  Thank you.

        We are going to Japan!  After perusing the net for cheap airefares, we finally found one where there were actual seats still available at that low, low price!  When we realized that yes, indeed, we can proceed to the next step in booking the tickets, we had to discuss whether we really want to do this or not.  Needless to say, it did take us all of 5 minutes to decide to go ahead and book!  And where did we find these cheap tickets?  urlLink AirTicketsDirect.com   It seems that they deal with consolidators for some flights.  In any case, we're just glad we got these tix!  Now that we've got the tickets, we put our itinerary together.  As we will be going in October, the weather should not be too hot nor too cold.  It's still the tail-end of typhoon season, so there is still that chance of foul weather.    We scoured the guidebooks we had on Japan and game up with the following itinerary:  Tokyo - Hakone - Kyoto - Hiroshima - Miyajima - Tokyo  Essentially, we will arrive in Tokyo, spend the first night there, then head straight to Hakone.  We will finish up the trip in Tokyo so that we won't have to worry about racing back to Tokyo from our last stop in order to catch our flight.  Hotels were a bit of a challenge.  After spending an entire weekend deciding on our itinerary, we spent about as much time researching hotels.  We knew that Japan was not going to be cheap.  We figure that if averaged about 15,000 yen/night for the two of us, then we would be OK.  In the end, we managed to find rooms that cost less than that.  This brought average cost per night down to 9525 yen!  That's not bad considering that we are going to "splurge" for a hotel close to Tokyo Station the first night.   But the bargain rates we got for Kyoto and the main Tokyo stay more than made up for that!  Anyway, we're both quite excited about the trip.  I bought a travel pack from  urlLink MEC  this past weekend.  It's about 58 liters and comes with a removable daypack.  It's not a terribly large daypack, but I think it will have it's uses.  We still need to find some travel towels as the  urlLink Tour Club  does not provide towels (they will rent them to you).  I think Black's has them.  We might swing by there this weekend to have a look.  Also on our shopping list is shoes.  We figure that if we will be entering a lot of places where we would be required to remove our shoes, then something that's easy to slip on/off as well as be able to handle a lot of walking will be the thing to wear!  We might poke around a couple of stores this weekend as well to see what's available and affordable.  Clothes.  I need lightweight (not summer-weight) pants.  I don't want to buy them now as I am hoping to lose a little weight and get into reasonable shape before the trip.  If we're going to be doing a lot of walking, I want to be able to handle all of that without losing my breath!  I might consider getting a skirt if the occasion arises and we go somewhere "nice".  I saw one at MEC that might fit the bill.  The trip there will be long.  We will be flying out of Chicago on  urlLink JAL .  From Montreal to Chicago, it will be Air Canada (code-share United flight, phew!).  It will be early in the morning (6AM out of YUL).  And it will be 13 hours from ORD to NRT.  I hope we will have enough to keep ourselves occupied if we can't sleep during the flight!  Seating.  I called JAL to reserve our seats.  Unfortunately, bulkhead and emergency aisle seats are airport controlled (prob as a result of 9/11).  The JAL rep on the phone put us in row 47, but also made note that we requested bulkhead/emergency aisle seating.  We'll find out when we get to the airport, I guess, if we can get those seats.  I wonder if we can get upgraded if we pose as blissful newlyweds! ;-)  We'll see!  Less than a month and a half to go!!  Woo hoo!!!

      Well, if you're into Ministry of Sound, this is pretty cool:  urlLink John 00 Fleming biography .  In other things, it's been a long week at work.  There's essentially just two of us to do the work of 4 people.  We got 3 more people to help out, but they require some training on the processes.  So guess who has to train them.  ME!  This means not getting some work done.  Oh well.  As soon as they are up to speed it should be better.  The weekend is here finally!  Don't really have a whole lot planned for this weekend.  Maybe head over to this place called Atmosphere to see what sort of travel-weight pants they have.   I've decided to really work on a regimen to get back into shape and lose a little weight in the progress.  I'm going to try to keep track of what I eat and how much.  Also, if I can't cycle to work, then I'm going to use the exercise bike at home.  We'll see how long I can keep this up! ;-)

      Went up to the cottage last night, mainly to water some plants, but we figured that since we were up there we might as well spend the night up there.  Brought the iBook up along with the Japan books in an attempt to tighten up our itinerary.  I think we did alright.  Installed Blosxon and Movabletype on this machine as well.  I figure I'd play around with them and see how they work out for blogging.  It's not that difficult to install, but will take a little time to figure out how to customize. :-)

      Ahhhhh!  The weekend at last!  I thought it would never come!  It's just been yet another wild and crazy week at work.  Sometimes I don't feel like I get much of a break in between days.  I hope to relax a bit this weekend.  We'll prob go up to the cottage Saturday night.  Need to water the plants, but figure it would be nice to take advantage of Dave's parents not being there.  Got some ground meat out of the freezer the other day.  Should be good to go for tomorrow :)  Had a discussion at lunch about just getting up and moving to another country.  Abe can easily get used to the idea.  He's already been in other places for extended periods for work, so it would not be a big deal for him to get up and go.  For others of us, it is a bit more difficult.  There's this one girl at work who took a sabbatical and went to Africa where her sister was at the time.  I don't think we can take sabbaticals nowadays.  You just can't guarantee that you'll come back to a job.  Oh well.. maybe one day when things get better.  8-)

      Well, I think I am really starting to feel old.  Went to the Dave Mathews Band concert last night (free tix!).  Maybe it's me, or maybe it's where we were sitting, but I found the music a bit too loud.  It seems like the pumped up the volume to the point where the singer's voice was becoming distorted.  I just could not make out what he was singing.  Of course, not being a big DMB fan, I am at a disadvantage with regards to what the lyrics could have been!  So, today, my ears are not ringing too much, but for one reason or another, I have this stiff neck.  This is too bad, because I was hoping to play softball tonight.  The team won yesterday!  But I don't want to aggravate this stiff neck. :-p  Sux to be old.  Anyway, still counting down the days to Japan! Come the end of the week, we will have approximately 3 weeks to go!!  :-D  Payday tomorrow!  WOO HOO!!

      Had gone over to Jardin Jasmin yesterday and came away with just dirt!  Actually, that's probably a good thing.  I've got to look into taking better care of the orchids I have before I think about getting any more plants!  Anyway, we picked up a big bag of this stuff called hydroton.  they're like these little marble-sized balls made of baked clay.  In any case, we saw them used at the nursery for some plants that like a very moist environment.  I figure they would be great for the orchids to sit on top of!  It looks like they can stay moist for a while.  Also picked up a bag of soil for cactus and a bag of soil for african violets.  We need to repot one of Dave's plants and one of two plants I got from work needs more media.  I am really starting to like this little iBook.  I think that with each day I use it, the more accustomed I become with it.  There are prob still some things about the OS X environment I haven't discovered yet, but soon enough I will be an old hand at it.  I really like doing stuff wirelessly.  I don't know how I managed to compute from the PC desktop.    I don't think I will be giving up my desktop any time soon, yet, most of this weekend, I had been using the iBook.  I've also set it up so that I can receive my email on this machine.  Hope my PC doesn't get too lonely...  Anyways, it's exactly one month before the big trip!!! :)  1 day down, 29 more to go!!!!  Darn!  Have to go back to work tomorrow.  Even these long weekends just don't seem very long any more.  I'm supposed to play softball tomorrow, but we got tickets (from John) for the Dave Matthews Band concert at the Bell Centre.  Hrm...  Oh well.  I'm sure the team can handle things just fine without me! :D  Well, hey!  What would you choose?  ;-)  Had a taste of moon cake today.  I had bought a tin of them on Saturday.  They're from HK.  They're rather tasty but rather rich.  No wonder no one ever eats a whole one in one sitting!  These things can be deadly when eaten in large quantities!  We stopped by John and Jessica's to pick up the concert tickets and I brought them a small care basket of some braised beef I made last night and a mooncake.  I think Jessica will appreciate the moon cake. :D  Anyway, we tossed around the idea of going up to the cottage next weekend.  Maybe see if john and Jessica would like to come along and spend the day there.  It should be nice.  I just hope the weather cooperates.  :-)

      Ho hum....  Vacationed in Hawaii in May for two weeks.  Visited Kauai, Maui and Hawaii (Big Island).  It was quite interesting as well as somewhat expensive. :-p  But overall, we had a nice time.  It was awesome to see flowing red lava on Hawaii.  Just couldn't get enough of the wild chickens on Kauai! ;-)  Could do without the commercialism on Maui.

      It's been a rough week...  It started off slow... but I should have known that it was the calm before the storm.  Silly me.  I saw the signs.  I should have acted sooner.  Oh well.. I guess I will have to live with it.  Of course, half the team will be on vacation for the next two week.  That leaves just 5 of us to do the work of 10.  We are going to have so much FUN!  Not....  We shall see what state of mind we will all be in after 2 weeks...  Stay tuned for the next exciting episode of.... Packaging in Paradise!

      Yet another Monday.  I suppose it's become a mantra for many of us when we come into the office on a Monday morning.  Bleah.  At least I had a decent weekend.  The parents were by on their little road trip through Canada (Niagara Falls, Toronto, Montreal). The weather co-operated so we had a nice time checking out Chinatown and the downtown area.  We had dim sum for lunch which wasn't bad. Got me some new Merrells at MEC and the boys picked up some KK while we were there.  Picked up a few steaks at the local butcher as well as a couple of brochettes to grill for dinner.  All in all, we had a nice time.  The folks left early on Sunday.  The rest of the day we vegged and worked on some small things.  Dave did a clean install of OSX on the 12 inch iBook.  Had some problems afterwards with it communicating with the Airport Base Station.  I couldn't quite figure out why it just won't see it.  It could see a neighboring wireless network but not ours.  After some fiddling around and resetting the base station, I managed to get it (and my iBook) to see the base station again.  Before the settings for the airport were set to "Automatic".  Now they are set to specifically connect to our base station.  I'm wondering if it's because the other network was using 10.0.1.1 as well?  Hmmm...  Well, whatever the problem was, everything is working again. :-)  I'm wondering if that's why we occasionally lose contact with the base station....  So, after much dicking around with that, we needed to pick up a few things from the store as well as a new toner catridge for the printer.  That done, Dave was back to reading up on CSS.  I think I'll let him become the expert on that one.  :-)  After having looked for and downloaded all sorts of documentation on CSS, he finally remembered that he had bought a 2nd hand book on DHTML and CSS when we were in Boston (gotta love that Victor Hugo book store on Newbury street).  So I guess he'll be reading that for a while.  In the meantime, I should get my own ass in gear and read up on some stuff as well.  The problem I'm having is finding the energy to even get started.  I want to learn a bit about Perl programming.  I'd like to have a look at CSS as well.  Oh well...  We'll see how things work out with the O2 as a server.  Will have to investigate a bit further about ISPs.....

      The mind is such a terrible thing to waste... So, don't use it!!!! ;-)  Yet another day.  I don't know if Tuesdays are any better or worse than Mondays.  OK, so we're one day closer to Friday on a Tuesday than if it were a Monday.  However, Tuesday is still closer to the beginning of the work week than it is to the weekend.  Tuesday is just one of those days.  There must be a conspiracy behind Tuesdays.  I find that programming on TV for Tuesdays are quite boring compared to other days of the week.  Why is that?  Something to think about on a Tuesday, I suppose. ;-)  Day has been relatively quite.  Like yesterday, I've got stuff to do, but nothing that's too overwhelming (thank goodness!).  Yet, I don't feel that I am as busy as I should or could be.  Look at this!  I'm blogging during my lunch hour!  I guess it's probably better I wasn't working and eating my lunch at the same time.  I read somewhere that this is not really healthy for you.  I suppose one thing that could happen is that you get indigestion or heartburn if you're stressed over work while eating.  Not a good thing, I guess...  Maybe I'll post more pictures later. :)

      Why is it that on Mondays I really don't feel like doing a heck of a whole lot?  Or maybe there just doesn't seem to be a whole lot happening today. :-p  Clouds have been coming in and out during the day.  There was a sprinkle or two in the morning.  If the weather remains stable, I might decide to ride into work tomorrow.  We'll see...  I hate days where I just sit around waiting for the next crisis to pop up.  I've managed to do what I need to have done today done already.  There are plans to do some other stuff, but that's only for tomorrow.   bored, bored, bored.....  maybe I shouldn't say that.  I might jinx things.... :-o

       Quick Grill Idea  Marinate boneless, skinless chicken breast in some italian dressing for about an hour. Prepare as a side some veggies.  Grill chicken breasts on the ol' bbq and VOILA!  Dinner is ready!  Gotta love summer grilling.  It's fast and easy.  Another yummy idea: Chicken Satay.  Follow the recipe on a jar of Thai Kitchen's Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce and you've got yourself some delicious chicken satay with some kick! :-)

      It's Saturday.  Do you know where your mind is?  Somedays I wonder about that.  I think it's there.  But then, if I think, therefore I mind?  Not that simple is it?    It's sunny.  I'm listening to some Latin tunes courtesy of Putumayo.  It's a change of pace from whatever is usually playing on the radio or the music video stations.  Plus, my CD collection has been a bit stale lately.  I haven't really been inspired by much these days in the music department.  At work I usually tune into either  urlLink Ministry of Sound  or  urlLink Trance Airwaves .    Maybe it's because it's easy for me to push the music into the background while I work.  I notice that when there is no background noise or music, it's a tad more difficult for me to concentrate on what I am doing.  Strange, no?    The other half has gone off on a bike ride around the island.  I think he needs to work off some of the stress he's been feeling at work as well.  It's been rough since it's currently just he and his boss running the operation.  Sometimes he has to pull some long hours.  I'm just glad he doesn't have to go into work today. :-p    I suppose I should try to be a bit more productive today.  Maybe I can try to finish  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix .  It's been languishing on my nightstand for some months now.  Hmm, better make that a year.  I think I picked up the book not long after it was released.  I have such a backlog of books to read.  I recently ordered two books by Anthony Bourdain (A Cook's Tour on FoodTV) from Amazon.ca.  I almost wanted to get some computer books at Chapter's recently, but then remembered that there was a library at work.  Saved quite a few bucks right there!    Hmm.. Maybe I should look into trying some of the recipes in  Flavors of Aloha.    It's a neat little cookbook I picked up when we were in Hawaii this past May.  It's put together by the Japanese Women's Societ of Honolulu.  It's got a nice mix of recipes from the different ethnic groups that populate Hawaii.  Quite a few of the recipes are traditional with a Hawaiian twist to it.  I should mention that while we were there we did not have any Spam.  We did have some  poke  which is quite delicious and is a different spin on sashimi. :)    OK, all this food talk is starting to make me hungry.  I think it's time for breakfast. ;-)

That's on Sunday though. &nbsp;  Other than that I just hope to unwind and relax a bit this weekend.&nbsp; I don't want to exert too much of my gray matter.&nbsp; Or, what's left of it anyway....     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Another day, another dollar.      Yet another rip, roaring day at the office today.  The usual B.S. and craziness.  Everyone making demands of all of us.  It's amazing that no one has gone postal yet! %-]    But other than that, I think I managed to accomplish what I was hoping for today.  Of course, some stuff had to be put on hold until an a proper solution is found. :-p  A bit frustrating if you've already put in a lot of hours into it.    In the meantime, I am rather exhausted! I am just about ready to zonk out!  But I figure I'd write a little bit.    I've also been trying to work on building up an itinerary for next year's Japan trip.  If we take 4 weeks, then we could probably get to visit more places...  It's been slow going... :-/    Anyway...

      Argh!!! I hate telemarketers... But thank goodness for caller ID.  For some reason, I have been getting some unsolicited calls from chinese telemarketers.  It just annoys the hell out of me!  Just because I have a Chinese surname, they assume they can sell me something.  These calls tend to be originating from the Toronto area and they all want to sell me long distance!!! :-p  Needless to say, they almost always try to call during dinner time. :-p    Anyway, today was just one those days at work where things just keep coming at you one right after another.  It was a relatively busy day but they were mainly issues about one thing or another.  I kinda like dealing with issues as long as it's something that makes me think a bit.  Ho hum.....

      OK.. not quite ready for bed... Neglected to mention that back in January, in the throes of wanting to spend some money, I got myself a 14-inch G4 iBook.  Of course this was just some weeks before Apple announced the release of an even more updated version of the iBook. :-p  Other than that, I'm quite satisfied with this little machine.  At first, I really wasn't sure if I had wanted the 12-inch or the 14-inch.  I had used the older 12-inch and I liked the compactness of it.  But, I decided to go "big" and get the 14-inch.  It took a little getting used to, but it's great. :-)  OK... Now I try to go to sleep... %-)

      Finally, it's the end of the work week.  However, I don't think my work is done.  I've still got to go into work Saturday to finish up something I can't remotely from home. :-p  Kinda sucks.  A bit stressful this week.  Had to work on some stuff that the customer wanted today, but it was delivered to us somewhat incomplete.  If they knew what they were testing, they would have caught this little oversight.  As it was, I had to discover this little problem.  Oh well, the customer, needless to say, did not get their patch today.  We'll see if the escalation process yields any answers on Monday.  Got a hair appointment tomorrow as well.  I think I'll go to my appointment before heading into the office.  Dave has to go into work tomorrow too.  Oh well, at least it's both of us.  Still trying to research some more stuff for next year's trip to Japan.  I had printed out some stuff from the JNTO site for some placed in the Chubu area.  Will try to print out some more stuff later.  Here's a  urlLink link  my brother just showed me.  A cyclist he knows.  Crazy things.  Speaking of crazy... Car started to start up a bit louder than usual as well as making some funny noises.  Brought it to the garage Tuesday night, next day, he tells me that the exhaust pipe fell off as he was moving the car out and back into the garage.  Funny it happens at the garage and not on the street!  Strange luck!  Need to start planning the painting of the bathroom.  Brought back a slew of color samples last week, but we haven't had a chance to go through them yet.  Oh well....  *YAWN*  Ok, that's it...

      Not much about anything...  I woke up this morning feeling quite exhausted.  I don't know why.  I can't say that I have been overworked, nor have I been physically pushing myself either.  Maybe it's time for another vacation.  Another?  Yes, we just took 2 weeks in May to jet off to bee-yoo-tee-full Hawaii.  The weather could have been better, but overall, it was really nice, albeit a bit expensive.  My Mastercard bill is still reminding me how expensive it was. :-p  Highlights of the trip?  Well, we got to visit three of the islands: Kauai, Maui and Hawaii (the Big Island).  On Kauai, I would have to say it was the boat trip to the Napali Coast.  At the same time, it was also sort of the low-light because I nearly tossed my cookies because of the rough waters. :-p  But the sight was spectacular!  On Mauai, I think the drive up Haleakala was really nice, especially the views of the cindercones from the top. Coincidentally, that was also the day we were suppose to do the mountain bike ride down from Haleakala. :-/  On Hawaii, it would have to be the lava flows.  After trekking about a mile and a half out, we got to see real, red, flowing lava.  Despite the heat and the exhaustion, it was a trek well worth the physical pain.  Also got to see some petroglyphs on the way down to the end of the Chain of Craters Road.  Would we visit Hawaii again?  Probably not any time soon.  We found it a bit expensive despite the deals we got on our hotels, cars and flights.  In general, food is not cheap.  When we visited a supermarket on Maui, we were somewhat put-off by the price of some everyday items like orange juice.  I suppose that since everything has to be shipped over from the mainland, a certain premium has to be paid for these items.  So, as a result, everything else is also rather expensive.  Real estate is also at a premium out there for obvious reasons.  Amazingly, while we were there, gas prices had started to climb in the US and Hawaii did  not  have the highest gas prices.  California did!    Well, planning has started for our next vacation.  We're planning another trip to Japan in 2005.  This time we want to go for 3 weeks.  Also, Dave bought tickets for the World's Expo, so there's another reason for going. :-)  We haven't come up with a firm itinerary yet.  However, this time I'd like to try to make it down to Fukuoka and Beppu.  We'll probably make Kyoto our homebase for visiting the Expo site in Aichi prefecture.  We figure that it'd be nicer to stay in Kyoto versus Nagoya.  And with the rail pass it would make commuting between Kyoto and Nagoya easier.  Will have to investigate some possible destinations soon!  :-)
