      the truth is the fanbase of 16 teams all think they have a chance. the truth is we were let down. the truth is hell is letting loose in ottawa. the truth is we will always have another season. the truth is it was probably the last game for a lot of people. the truth is lalime may have cost us. the truth is i think they are feeling what i am.  the truth is i never want to question my team like this, ever again. the truth is there will always be hope. the truth is this group just played its last game together. the truth is being a leaf fan would be hell of a lot easier. the truth is there is a lot of shit i have to face tomorrow. the truth is the rest of my life will get some attention. the truth is i get the feeling i've just wasted years of my life. the truth is iwanttocry. the truth is i'm going to throw up. the truth is i think i still believe.

      Lalime, we'll always have 2003.  But that's about it.  Muckler has a very itchy trigger finger, so I expect some UFA signings without a week of July 1st, starting with the official announcement of Hasek. On my short wish-list so far, there's just Draper. He's interested in playing for Toronto, but Toronto will have to move either Nieuwendyk or Antropov for Draper, and Ottawa needs him more [and has more to offer him, in terms of $$$].  It really had to happen. I don't think any of us thought that together, Bonk and Lalime would only fetch a 3rd and 4th rounder, but I'm more focused on how to effectively fill the void that's been left without letting the team slip back into the old mold and chemistry. The two trades [however rip-offs they may be] have sent messages to current Sens players that they cannot do nothing in the playoffs, and there will be severe consequences. Finally, there's an atmosphere of accountability, not to mention $6 mil cleared in payroll.  Lalime, Bonk, have a great life. We'll always have 2003.

      (1) The Bonk Trade. Bonk was involved in a three-way deal that sent him to L.A. from the Sens for a third-round pick, then L.A. dealt him to Montréal for Garon and a third-round pick. To many Senator fans, they are probably glad that Bonk, notorious for not showing up and having size but doing nothing with it, has had at least some return, but like myself, a little queasy about the fact that he'll stay in our division. He is not a no. 1 centreman, sucks at face-offs and disappears in the playoffs and in the end, I'm glad he's gone. His $3.5 mil salary frees up some more cash to entice other UFAs with [preferably a gritty LW, and another centre]. Bottomline, he's gone, and that's reason enough to celebrate.  (2) Hasek deal becoming final. Sportsnet is reporting that Hasek has agreed to terms with the Sens for a $2-$3.5 mil base contract, with heavy performance-based incentives. Should the Sens win the Cup, he will be the highest paid goaltender in the league. I've discussed this before, and I stick by that Hasek is our best option. His age and fondness for injury makes me nervous, but Lalime gives me nervous breakdowns. As a neutral observer, Hasek is still completely unpredictable. As a Sens fan, I have to throw all my support behind him [but not on his groin, because that thing is carrying most of our hopes].  (3) Sens draft picks. Was very surprised at Meszaros being available at no. 23, and Kirill Lyamin is a steal. Peter Regin is the highest rated Danish prospect, which I find hilarious.

      i have a feeling we'll see the hasek deal get done this saturday, during the entry draft. seems fitting, since most of ottawa's major transactions have been done at draft day -- yashin for spezza, chara and muckalt, etc.   i don't need to remind you that hasek is old, creaky, cranky, unorthodox, and injury-prone, but i'm too busy staring at his hart and vézina trophies. i just don't think there are any better options for ottawa. prusek is mentally weak, emery is not ready, and lalime will collapse under the weight of the fan's scrutiny and $$$-power should he play another season [not that he hasn't already]. my feelings toward lalime will be like a hated ex that after a cooling off period you realise wasn't all that bad. however, even after realizing their somewhat redeeming qualities, you realize you'd still not be involved with them, but at the same time, you don't want to see them rebound before you do.  i'm not sure how lalime may do in vancouver; it might be disastrous if lalime does succeed. however, the canucks have just qualified cloutier [they still may trade him] and naslund has chosen to be on the cover of EA NHL 2005, successfully jinxing any chances they may have next season.  radek bonk is an enigma wrapped in a dream wrapped in a sloth-like attitude. muckler won't get anything redeeming for him; i'm reluctant to trade him for picks, and letting him go for nothing after "developing" him after all these years seems a waste. that freed salary looks nice, though.

      dear calgary,  you know i hated you from the start. you were everything my senators weren't.  if only you had an iota of their heart, ottawa! if only! now go eat some golf turf dirt!  but you know, afterwards, after i actually watched you, you weren't what i expected. the hoards of people jumping on your bandwagon bothered me. a lot, because they weren't there from the start, they hadn't watched you struggle and now they wanted to take part in your victory because you're, well,  canadian . but i tried to ignore that and came to the conclusion that i'll cheer for you. really, it's not bandwagon jumping, but i want you to win. why? because your opponent is even more detested. maybe i sound like a spinster old, resentful grandmother, but tampa bay and ottawa were born in the same year and besides, it doesn't feel right. not that you do either. just go beat those bolts.

       urlLink     Richmond Hill, past Yonge & Major Mackenzie Dr. Why is this photo of significance, besides the fact that it is the flag and face of the enemy? It's in the shop-window of a porn-shop (You can see the last bit of "DVDS"). I believe the store dressing was taken down and replaced by a help-wanted sign after the Leafs loss to the Flyers, though.  urlLink          Some other amusing tidbits from the playoffs include: a pick-up truck that, after the Leafs' game 6 loss to the Flyers, spelled out "PHUCK PHILLY" on its windows; a mural depicting Alfie as a clown and a Stanley Cup, with the caption "WHAT DOES NOT BELONG"; in my high school, a piece of paper taped to the teachers' cafe (one of the teachers is a Flyers fan) that read some insulting slander each day (I took the liberty of turning it over and scrawling pro-Flyers messages); my own home-made GO SENS GO banner in my locker that must've attracted ten hate-intense stares a day; and finally, wearing my Sens jersey, walking down the halls and passing two guys in Leafs jerseys and laughing as we did so.      Hockey must start again.

       Well, the necessary summer lull is over. Th  e usual sleepy rumours spinning back to June and July and spit, regret-filled talk about the upcoming CBA expiration have made this offseason so far the calm before the storm. Except for spitting up hail, winds and water though, I'm thinking it'll evoke panic about what to do on Saturday nights, why hockey's completely disappeared and how to get a fix of it. I'm actually looking fowards to going to see some OHL games in my area, although I'd look forward to it more and allow myself to get emotionally involved if there were any Sens prospects playing in the OHL. On that segway ...       Meszaros will be playing for the Vancouver Giants of the WHL . Andrej Meszaros, the 1st round pick of the Senators in this year's 2004 NHL Entry Draft, has decided to play for the Vancouver Giants. This comes upon speculation that he'd be staying to play in the Slovakian League (a better league in terms of quality -- the elite league in Slovakia). Chara did the same, and I think a year of North American hockey can't be detrimental to Meszaro's development.       Chara, Phillips and Schaefer re-signed at 2 yrs/$9 mil, 4 yrs/$8 mil and 2 yrs/$2.5 mil.  None of the contract terms are particularly unexpected. However, Chara's signing does leave Ottawa with the possible free-agency of both Chara  and  Redden, at the same time. Could the club be forced to choose between them? It's a chilling idea. Schaefer is a useful player and I expect him to continue his development. I'm still puzzled to as why Burke really had to beg for a 4 year contract from Schaefer. Muckler still has two RFA players left to sign: Varada, who is expected to accept his qualifying offer, and Havlat, who, unforgettably, missed several games last season due to his absence of a contract. He still has no arbitration rights, but his point-per-game season begs for a raise. Currently, the Senators payroll stands at around $37 mil.      In other less important news, Toronto's AHL franchise, the St. John's Maple Leafs, will be moving to Toronto for the 2005-2006 season. I'm still torn as to if I should go to to all the Binghampton-Toronto games to check up on Bochenski and Emery, but put money in the pockets of MLSE, or if I should just stick to the OHL and read second-hand accounts of Bochenski and Emery's accomplishments. Also, it's certain that it won't be the most friendly atmosphere for a road-team fan, with the presence of Leaf fans who couldn't afford tickets to see the real Leafs and being pissed off about it, etc.       Alternate hockey : World Cup of Hockey news - Hannan replaces Blake (foot), Théodore replaces Belfour (back). Apparently, talks are on for a player-organized 11-team tournament, featuring Hasek (and other players, but none that are important). The chance for Hasek to gain some valuable game experience and not hurt his groin is golden.       Social events : Alfie got married in Sweden. (Confirmed by media outlets) Bonk got drunk on a golf course and renounced his Senator-ship. (First-hand retelling)
