       Hello ,        first time writing but feeling so dreadful. Today i went back to school , had to wake up unusually early for this. Was around 7am when i finally got up , reluctanly , ate what i could eat and just dashed off for school. Upon reaching school , the first thing i saw was..oh dear , Ms Teo !! Our chinese teacher who wont stop yelling at us~ And what holiday , the first thing she did when she stepped into the class , do work.. *Sigh*       Well , good thing , when she left , my heart's stone dropped and i kinda relaxed as i know Mr Tan would not be such a meany to make us do that much work. Well , he even let us go to the theartrette !! So cooling..ahh..and we chatted alot and only did abit of work , how nice ^.^ Hope tommorow would be a better day..Ms Teo's homework i already completed , well , a burden released. Only thing left , stupid chinese spelling. Ahh..some more Suprianto laughed when i had to sit with Douglas in class. He thinks its very funny eh...Cant wait , 2 more days , supplementary over..a few more days.. *Sigh*  back to school...Prelims..PSLE...*Panic* If i dont do well for PSLE , you might never see me again >. *SobsOb*  Well , tonight France vs. Switzerland and England vs. Croatia.   My Prediction  : France 2-0 Switzerland                 England 1-1 Croatia  Oh well , there you go , my predictions ^.^ If they come true , must thank me hor  *Hehe*  But dont bet , if you lose , i go hide ler. *Hoho* Well , until next time , i shall end my post with a message of the day.   Message Of The Day  : Suprianto is like a vacuum cleaner , they both make alot of noise but in they end , they still suck.
