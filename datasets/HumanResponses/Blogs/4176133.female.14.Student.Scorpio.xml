      I think exersise is horribly undignified. Jews don't exercise, It uses up blood better left in the brain. My grandfather is a rare exception, he's a Jew who became rich from  the exercise of gay men (for the most part.) He recently sold his magazine company, which had begun to flag, and is slightly out of sorts. No wonder, he had started his bushiness from scatch and devoted his life to it, and now it's in the paws of some slimy yuppie.  I used to be fat until two years ago when I went to THE WORST FUCKING BOARDING SCHOOL ON EARTH. Bye bye trust fund. Up in lake placid, it was -30*F in the daytime for two solid weeks. We spent a fortune in long underwear.  The food was so shitty and it was so hard to stay warm the pounds melted. I became so thin (99 lbs. From 120) They declared me anorexic and kept "an eye" out on me, which meant I could not eat salad. Really.  I don't have strong self-destructive tendencies (like my then-pal, 13 year old R, who said she fucked men anytime she wanted to at home). The strangest thing I do is that sometimes I'll go outside (or in the house when I'm alone) and breath as fast and as deeply as I can unlil I almost or hypervenilate. I like the tingily sort of feel it gives me, and I'm sure it's harmless.  The art department sucked horribly as well. We had one, sporadic drawing class taught by this mannish woman who knew no one (except ME, dammit) had any interest in developing work, so she gave us beginner exercises out of a textbook. One of the kids could only draw stick figures, and he was so utter daunted one class he put his head on the table and cried. I nearly felt sorry for him, but he was such a little piss-pot I snickered with the rest of the class. It was a rare moment of solidarity among my classmates.

      I haven't mentioned it, but I've spent the last two weeks up in provincetown with my mother, sibs and grandmother.  My sister is nine, my brother seven, and they each have their problems but we've gotten along much better since I decided to ignore them most  of the time.  My mom doesn't know about this blog, I don't want her to.  I don't think I care or even want anyone to read this blog.  If someone did, I'd love for them to send me an e-mail.  All my friends are fucking crazy and have almost no access to a computer. My best friend has begun a bike trip across California, to eventually end up in Mexico, where she knows no-one.  It's 9:40 as I write this, and our fragment of hurricane Charlie has still to run it's course. I read a charming article in the utne reader called either "how blogs ruined my life" or "how my life is ruined by blogging," but it was very funny, and although I believe pre-2000 utne is superior to current issues, It's worth  reading and you can subscribe to utne through their website. I've begun to read The Extra Man, about a gentelmanly tranvestite in new york who rooms with an eccentric elderly escort.

      There was nothing she detested so much in the climates and seasons as a fine summer afternoon, with its lazy languor, with the obscene, satiated luxuriance of its vegetation which seems to communicate itself both to animals and people. The dreadful act initiated by those muggy, voluptuous hours was that of lounging in a chaise longue with one's legs apart and one's arms raised, while yawning very loudly, as if obliged to expose one's genitals, armpits, and mouth to goodness knew what kind of rape. Against this triple yawn, Melanie cultivated the laugh and the sob, two reactions which implied refusal, distance, and the human being's withdrawal into itself. The weather best suited to this rejection syndrome was a luminous frost, which gave rise to a denuded, frozen, hardened, and brilliant character...  Like all children, she had encountered the mystery of death. But in her eyes it had immediately taken on two completely opposite aspects. The animal corpses she had seen were usually swollen and decomposed, and exuded sanious secretions. Such beings, reduced to their last extremities, crudely avowed their basically putrid nature. Whereas dead insects became lighter, spiritual, and spontaneously attained the pure, delicate eternity of mummies. And this did not only apply to insects for, ferreting around in the attic, Melanie had found a mouse and a little bird that were equally desiccated, purified, reduced to their own distinctive essence. This was a good death. -From Michel Tournier's The Fetishist, "Death and the Maiden," lifted from "slurping sounds." (I'm not clear on the mechanics of posting from an excerpt of another's post, but since I didn't actually use her words, I'm pretty sure I won't have to ask her permission.)

       The birth of my blog! Can you smell the silicone? This blog will suckle gladly at the breast of the summer of my fifteenth year. Sigh. I suppose you middle-aged readers with you had your youthful exuberance and health to spend hours on a pathetic open journal. But this is the Hollywood of the diary! Who knows what young starlet will be discovered? Perhaps a talent agent, after hours spent shuffling through the millions of dull blogs that pollute the internet, to happen upon (not this one, I only post to spread the love)one sassy, sprite of as blog that has him on the very edge of his swivel seat. He must know who is the possessor on such a swift, witty tongue! You are discovered, and it's only a matter of time until you've got a sitcom and a book deal in the oven. Life is sweet!
