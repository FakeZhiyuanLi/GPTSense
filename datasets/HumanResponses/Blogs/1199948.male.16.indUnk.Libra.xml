      The Stranger (101 favorite restrooms) excerpt 87.  Barça  1510 11th Ave Widely praised as the most luxurious ladies' room on Capitol Hill, Barça's girls' loo boasts private stalls, fresh lilies, a velveteen settee, and a graceful pedestal ashtray. It's also a nice place to have a drink when the bar gets too crowded. (And the ladies didn't seem to mind a couple of guys hanging around, smoking cigars, and watching them primp.)  88.  Bad Juju Lounge  1518 11th Ave In a witty bit of floor-planning, the Bad Juju's VIP men's room boasts a crotch-level aquarium forming part of the wall, overlooking the rest of the bar, and offering lucky patrons the possibility of a glimpse of VIP genitals.

      Some Hives News! Their new album, which is still untitled, should be out on July 20 on Interscope. "Idiot Walk" is the first single and a video was shot yesterday in Sweden. The single is scheduled for June.    most importantly, US tour dates begin in mid-July. If you've seen The Hives before, you know that they are awesome (and hilarious) live. If you've never seen them, I feel sorry for you, and you should do your best to get to one of these summer shows

Get your stride on Relax, man there's nothing for you to worry about just let the flashbacks fly by  don't worry about the shrapnell dancing about Its time to relax Just forget you're in a crash-site its time to relax  (you're in the ocean)

      Tripping over roots in the deep dark forest of El Gruss Its me and a moose, we're battling to the death No one had known about the dangerous Malone The Italian Sovereignty Survived...  I knew i was gonna die Running through streets tripping over side walks  I was jumping over creeks  and slipping on the big rocks  in my waaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy (3x)  And as my enemies they stalked me while i was breathing hard, sweating even harder and running really far With gloves on, to leave no trace, they were going kill me, and steal my face And put it on, one of their dangerous criminals with knifes, and guns and pity at a minimal degree... He'd look like me... Oh no, they'll get me, make me into a criminal get me to kill all the drug dealers who they hate, all old ladies who have purses to take their money... They'll take my face Don't let them do it, they'll take my face I know just how they do it... Who cares about my money, my bank account, my family, Its all about my face when you get down to it... Don't take my face don't take my place... don't make do the things i never wanted to do Take my money, Take my house, Take my keys,  my car,  but just don't, don't take my face... (my face is mine, i must keep it on all the time, my face is mine, this time i'll kill you IT IS MINE my face)
