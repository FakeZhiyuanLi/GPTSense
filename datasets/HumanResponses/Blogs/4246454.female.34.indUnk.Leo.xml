       The appointment with LanguageWire was postponed until next week. So after the morning meeting I had some time over to put up posters with the bicycle trailer - anyone interested? Back here I wrote Vertalershuis Amsterdam to ask if I can sign up for the Translation Days, one of my online CV's was renewed and a translation of the word doc into English was begon.     Conclusion on the "selling" of the Belgian book: Author first, me next. Contact with Danish writer interesting by the way and preparation of miniquestionnaire and calling 2nd translator nl-da started.

      What the ...?! On pages 16-19 in the latest  urlLink Magisterblad  there's an interview with the ideahistorian Preben Groenkjaer who apparently has written this book on the ways of communication for16 personality types. Page 19 then shows a diagram with descriptions of the 8 typological functions and their characteristics - an exact copy of the 4 dimensions E-I, S-N, T-F and J-P from  urlLink MBTI !!! Well excuse me, but isn't there a problem with intellectual property right and/or copyright here? - I mean the article does spell out Jungs name in the wery beginning but nowhere MBTI or even Isabel Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs are mentioned. I sure hope for mr. Groenkjaer that the same isn't the case in his book, otherwise there's going to be trouble... For sure I'm not the only one reading the article and making the very same conclusion - since MBTI is "only" one of the worlds leading personality test tools. Pffffh... how amateurish.

      For once the evening news brought information that was personally relevant to me! :-)  The interview with Andre Brink from the  urlLink World Literature Days  on Moen was great. It's oh so true that what South Africa has tried to overcome and cure the past years is exactly what pops up in the rest of the world right now. I only hope that he's right about the necessity of this in order to be able to spot the problems and address them properly.  And then the  urlLink Yngling ladies  won OL bronze today! Congratulations girls!!! - And of course it's not as great as silver but what the ... ;-) - When will I go sailing again? Well, at least rowing is within reach by now :-)

      Starting on the translation of the 1st Belgian thriller tonight! Isn't it just exciting? :-))  My mother went to Brussel this morning and is going to stay there for the weekend, living in a hotel nearby Grote Markt. I wish it was me - doing field studies there.

      This blogger.com thing already starts annoying me - the possibilities for editing etc do not fulfil my needs. I'd like to be able to move around text, to divide my postings in categories, to have several pages so that the link section doesn't have to be that long... And now that I'm at it: How do you make links in comments on other weblogs such as   urlLink click here  ?! Ohhh to be or not to be - a programmer, nerd, whatever... Perhaps just knowing a little bit about html...   To be or not to be - that's the question, but not to me :-)    And then there's the pictures! Stupid digicam! - Or is it this pc? Hmmmm... And the time reference!! - Prefer CET (which is UCT/GMT+1 hour) to AM/PM!  Testing testing 123...

       Today I have looked up more information on how to finance the agent-translator project and how to ensure high quality on the end product:       I need to sell out some stuff in order to raise capital for new hardware - and software actually. The latter because I'll have to translate other things than fiction via translation agencies in order to make a living, but that's ok and I think the cooperation with especially one of the  urlLink agencies  will be fruitful. (This aside, I still need a permanent position of some kind in order to minimize the risk...)      A mail with an application for doing a test translation with the NLPVF/FvdL has been sent off, which is quite unusual I guess:    Normally translators take this test once they've signed their first contract with a publisher.    In my case however, it's not the publisher turning to me in order to have me do a translation for them of a book of their choise. No, it's the other way round: I start translating and then try and convince the publisher that he should sign a contract with me and the author of my choice.   I hope, I can get to do the test translation on grounds of this great initiative :-). It would be fine if I on top of my diplomas and work experience so far can state that I've already been recognized as a literature translator by the relevant Dutch authorities.      I've learned that the 6th Literary Translation Days are going to be held on 10-11th of december this year and that the "special" workshop will concentrate on translations nl-da and da-nl this time! Of course I'm not going to let this chance to see my beloved Utrecht again slip away and am going to sign up for this event as well.      ZZZzzzleep tight...

       Challenge: For some time now I have wanted to translate fiction and I have come across this great Belgian author and wish to translate his series of 5 thrillers from Dutch to Danish. But how to present this idea the best possible way without disclosuring too much - now that I've found out that the Publishers have their "own" translators? Try and sell my self as an experienced and gifted translator...(I am :-) but...)? Translate the whole first chapter and some of the Belgian reviews and then...? Package solution... how?
