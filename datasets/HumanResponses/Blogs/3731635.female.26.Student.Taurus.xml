      Well, went for my usual walk this morning, and showed my walking partner the route that I mapped out yesterday. I ran and ran all day but still found time to figure out a few healthy meals (brats with a ton of kraut on them are healthy, right?) I didn't have much of an appetite all day, and found myself straining to gulp down a small supper portion. I think I am maturing, slowly but surely, and a major realization that I had today was that I sometimes will have to do things that I don't want to do, that may not be fun, just because they have to be done, and that is part of what an adult is all about. I bought some decent groceries tonight, so that will hopefully make things a little better, I tried to get things that were healthy and easy to prepare, hoping I won't want "bad" stuff then. I had a chocolate bar today, and a piece of hard candy, but that is better than yesterday, and that is what counts for me today, since all I have to do, I figure, is keep my healthy lifestyle changes working today, and that's it, tomorrow is another day.

      Well, today is day two, woke up at my parent's house five minutes before I was supposed to meet my friend for our usual walk, but due to a migraine, I was left with walking on my own, and I give myself credit, because I went! I took a new way that I've wanted to for a while, and surrounded by clouds of wildflowers and birds singing (I even spotted two birds making love!) I felt such a powerful sense of self love, that I knew I was strong enough to do what I need to do to take care of myself, just for today. The walk lasted a little over an hour, and I was able to watch the train go by, and I always feel better after that. I did not do as well with my eating habits, though. My candy bar total was four by nine am this morning, darn those 2 for a dollar sales to heck! But on a more positive note, a good friend made me dinner tonight, and I listened to my body, because I was sated, and if I'd have eaten more, I would've felt sick and full, and when I am tired and on a low ebb, like lately with all of these weird combos of shifts I have been working lately, (first, second, and third all in one week!)I am likely to feel sick easily if I am not careful to moderate what I do, including eating. I have been making an attempt to drink the 100 or so ounces I am supposed to aim for (I did some research, and a person should divide their body weight in half and drink that in ounces) and I toss in a few cups for exercising too. I spent half the day in the bathroom, I hope my bladder adjusts soon! I am trying to live in today and not get too down on myself for my little backsteps, although it is hard sometimes. Tonight, for example, I play on a horseshoe pitching team, and my back started twinging really bad, from old injuries, (also I am sure from lack of sleep and poor self-care) and the "evil committee" in my brain (mean self talk that tells me how much I suck and all that I can't do) started in about all of the damage to my body that I have done, and would have been quite satisfied if I had felt like crap about it, but I shrugged it off, thinking to myself how I can't take back yesterday, but I can take care of myself today. I am reminded of this by the words of William Allen White, when he said "I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday, and I love today." This says it for me, for my yesterdays used to be so hopeless and my spirit filled with self-loathing and fear. I am not perfect (not yet, hehe) and I still have bad days, but I care about myself enough to stay sober and work on getting past my hangups to achieve a weight healthy for my body, and that feels so good.

      I gave up the other day, gave up the idea of being able to be a full-figured, happy healthy woman with healthy self-esteem. You see, I am full-figured, I am fairly happy, I am acquiring good self-esteem, but I flat out am not healthy at my weight, and I am not happy about that. I love my body as is, and I want to stay the same as I am. I feel adverse to becoming thin or even average. My skin crawls and I choke up at the thought of it. I know that how I feel isn't common, but it is my reality, and I have had to realize in the past few days that vanity and preference aside, if I don't want my body to screw me in the end, I have to attain a healthy weight the only smart way: eating healthier and exercising, on a continual basis. Atkins and the Zone be damned! If I have to do something I don't really want to do, I am at least going to do it the right way. I have been walking with one of my best friends in the whole world who also wants to achieve a healthy weight, we have been going for about an hour, sometimes a little less. Today was a beautiful walk around town, kind of got lost, but it is so nice to talk and vent about what is going on, what our plans are (yay! camping in august!) and sometimes we just enjoy the silence. I feel I will be able to achieve a healthy weight if I bite the bullet and do what I am supposed to, and leave the results (in all of my life) to my higher power.

      Well, I have been struggling a bit...Still have been going for my walks, yesterday was an hour through the park here in town, today was an hour through the park in my parents' town, which was great too. Even though I am enjoying my walks alot, and really am starting to look forward to them, I just am hung up on the aspect of physically losing weight when I like how I look now. Losing weight for my health requires some substantial looking ahead on my part, and even though I am uncomfortable now, and in pain physically, it still seems like that isn't enough to make me want to lose weight. I am still looking at the idea of doing what I have to do, regardless of whether I want to or not, which is soooo foreign to me. But I will keep chipping away at it and taking it day by day.

      Well, this is a bit late, I was a total slacker yesterday! It was actually pretty hot here in Wisconsin (to me) and since I wasn't a good girl about drinking my water, I felt the heat more than usual. I also got my period, too, which always drags me out and I get this crushing fatigue, which I guess is supposed to get better if a woman takes 1200 mg of calcium, plus 400 of vitamin D also. (the jars of vitamins are in my dresser) So I guess the idea of the day is making healthy actions a habit so I have some chance of remembering them. I did go for a walk though, not with my buddy, and only for a half-hour, but at least it was something. I napped most of the day, which felt really good, and did well with food, till my two candy bars in the afternoon. I bought some healthy groceries, and had a nice dinner. Kind of boring day...

      Well, today was pretty good, went for a walk with my walking partner and instead of our usual conversation, I felt like everything I said was judged or criticized, and so I found myself not talking or reverting the conversation back to her to avoid her judgements and jabs at me. I am not used to people being like that, especially in the 12 step meetings I attend for my alcoholism, where everyone is so warm and accepting of differences. I also realized that I need to do whatever it takes to succeed in keeping up my walking and working on managing my stress, and if this keeps up (it was kind of like that yesterday) I will have to start walking on my own, which I would have enjoyed much more yesterday and today. I just don't have any room in my life for that crap. On a lighter note, the rest of the day I napped, played scrabble, ran errands, did laundry, went to two meetings, and took myself out to dinner at the green mill. I would have liked a sunday (for taste!) but my body told me that I was full, so I declined, having the bill drawn up right after ordering the main course helped too, because I didn't want to trouble the waitress by getting the dessert and having to draw up another bill. I did have a tiny piece of cake at the second meeting tonight, but I don't feel bad about it, in moderation (if that is something I can maintain) sweets aren't bad, just not too good. I got a lot of compliments today, and that was nice, it is nice to hear things like that! I also feel that my confidence in talking with others (non-weight related) is increasing, which is nice. I realized today too that some kind of weight training exercise will be good for me, at home or in a gym, because that is good for building bone mass, and for my posture, which pretty much sucks the big one, and hopefully to help maintain my curves as I lose weight. I am looking forward to tomorrow, and I am hoping my walking partner is in a decent mood, I may bring my headphones along just in case!
