      Turning onto third There's a bird hopping away from the cafe With a piece of bread or something Just a few feet to avoid me Between two generations of sidewalk Sprinkled leaves and cigarettes And bits of paper find the cracks

      This evening I went up to this beautiful uptown apartment to see about the writing group. I've been getting their emails for a few months now, I may as well see what it's about, right? At first I thought it was going to be awkward because there were only four people there or so and I was definitely the youngest. At the end there were about twenty. As far as I could tell, it was a very polite, nice group of people. The leader, Z, really held it all together. I heard a few bad pieces and a few good pieces. The effect of forcing myself to stay in one place and write continuously for a whole hour was incredible. I came up with a few very lucid passages. I will start forcing myself to do that more often if I can. I met a kid there from park slope, B, who was also into meditation. I ran the idea of starting a meditation group by him. He said he'd never heard of anything like that in park slope and it sounded like a great idea. Later we went out for beers at jake's dilemma and saw the Lakers' crushing defeat.

      Though I'm not sure of the official definition, a zendo can be any place i suppose where one sits zazen, the zen flavor of seated meditation. Every good blog needs a thread. Every good person needs at one dimension of improvement. For the time being mine will be opening a zendo. And I'll tell you all about the process as it unfolds. My zendo will be like this: You sit there for two thirty-minute intervals. No discussions about zen, no insense, no fancy cushions. My zendo will most likely be the mildewy basement of a church, but that's fine.

      I figure my body has some way of telling me I'm eating too much PB&J right? I just won't feel right. Today I had about four. That's not too bad. I'm really not interested in the nutritional content. Never have been. My body knows what's right for it. For example, I start to crave eggs when I haven't had them in a long time. I crave the taste of the yolk after its been hard-boiled. And I know in my bones that the right was to cut a PB&J is vertically, to release the flavor (and to maintain the greatest degree of symmetry). I'm all about biofeedback.

      The first post. What to say. Just finished watching game one of the NBA finals. Basketball is the first sport I have ever watched. I grew up in a sports-free home, well, except for tennis. So my friends watch it all the time and I'm clueless. Why does Hamilton have that plastic on his face? But I'm starting to get into it. "He kind of reminds me of Hannibal Lecter," said one commentator. "I guess you could say he eats up the competition." No comment. Incidentally, I worked as a production assistant on an ESPN show a few weeks ago. And though it was sad how excited everyone else there was about sports and how I didn't know shit, I got to have an argument with lavar arrington over which were cooler: lions or hyenas. That's just the funny story I tell everyone.

      It started out a dream about walking across 3rd Ave. in Brooklyn, which can be a little creepy at night: nothing but run-down old warehouses and apartment buildings for about a quarter mile in every direction. A little bit of fear is sometimes enought to make me lucid, so I realize I'm dreaming and start flying up above the warehouses. And for some reason when I'm lucid and I start flying it always gets out of hand. I can't control my acceleration and I have no way of getting my feet back down on the ground. In frustration, I grabbed the sides of my frame of vision and started shaking it violently. The buildings, towers, streets shook with it, and when they were settled what I was looking at was a table where there were roofs before, a tea service, plates, silverware, and my feet were back on the ground.

      Besides being annoying, the blogspot banner you couldn't help but see at the top of this page is an incredible little semiotic jewel. Honestly, I've been giving the whole thing some thought. Every morning I ponder the dynamic between the artistic work and its signature as I take a piss. Mike put a cheesy posterboard Monet pring right above the toilet and wrote on it with a Sharpie: "To Mike: Keep on painting! -Monet." It's something I usually think about when I'm looking at a painting: Is the title important? Am I looking at a Gary Larson cartoon, i.e. is the title a punchline? Or do the art world people just "label" their paintings so that they won't get them mixed up with other ones? Anyway, this is getting complicated pretty quickly. I've got an idea, though: Why don't we title paintings in a new way- with a smaller copy of the painting. That way, you don't have to make the mental connection between the written title and the work itself. The only drawback to such a system is that it complicates the task of talking about many paintings at once when there isn't a linear flow between the image and the text that refers to it. The only people who really want to break up that flow are the people who want to talk about the meanings of images, anyway. And it's because of them that we got so mixed up in the first place. Images can represent themselves. The only place that they can't is in the languages used by machines.

      I've been eye-balling this blog template for a while, trying to figure out how to mess with the look of it. The only real way to preserve the look of the thing, since I have no idea how to go about messing with the fonts, is to write all in caps. Back in the 90's, when not everyone was hip to the internet yet, some nerd saw a connection between capital letters and shouting. Whatever. I never got into smileys either. I say if it worked for e. e. cummings I may as well try it myself.

      You know you see people walking around in NYC with advertisements on their shirts? I'm not talking about hipster trips to the Salvation Army. I mean real advertisements on real illegal aliens. You might see a dozen of them in a day in different parts of Manhattan. You know the whole process is shady because the shirts say things like "Eat more protein products." But in light of human billboards I don't feel like the google banner is such a big deal. So my blog isn't slick.

      There is a whole lot of change sitting in my car. It serves no purpose since I got EZ-Pass. It just sits there, all dimes, nickels and pennies. At least quarters are occasionally useful to pay parking meters. Yesterday, that change almost came in handy twice: first at Whitecrest Beach. As per usual, we got out early to surf, drove down there, asked the dude if it would be okay to park the car real quick and take a look before we committed to the $15 parking fee. He was cool with it. It was a grey day, and the wind was wrong, but we stood on top of the dune and concluded that this was our last day to even try, even if the surf was terrible. So finally we decide to commit to it and figure out we have like $13. A bit frustrating. Luckily for us, this insane guy, Bruce, introduces himself and chats up a storm: tells us he's on his honeymoon, hasn't slept for a month, his wife just wants to sunbathe but he's incredibly pumped to try surfing. He figures us for locals, which we aren't, and wants to info. He's friendly enough and we talk for a while; he pays the outstanding $2. God bless him. We exchange numbers in case we want to meet up at some point, but the rest of the week is rainy anyway. The change stays in the car. It wouldn't have been enough anyway. We wake up early this morning to turn in my wetsuit. It's like 9:30 and if I can get it to Orleans by 10:00 I don't have to pay for the day. Turns out Dad has the Subaru and the Maxima keys so we're stranded. We show up late but they cut us a break. By this point I'm starving but we don't have any money on our way to Chatham. All I want is Dunkin' Donuts, but I want it bad. The only one is on 137. We barely have enough change for a donut and coffee, but the thing is the line in there is like 20 people long. I've never beheld such a thing. Later on, we're in the Dunkin' Donuts in Eastham. Same thing. Unbelievable. So the change stays in the car.

       urlLink The Department of Homeland Security  has suggested, because of its many security flaws, that we stop using Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Just today there were 4 new  urlLink "critical vulnerabilities."   urlLink Firefox  is the hot, new, secure browser and I love it. First of all you can create tabs to keep multiple windows open. There are all these cool extensions, like a button that jumps to  random websites, a function that fills in annoying registration forms, etc. etc. It's amazing.

      This morning I had an incredible dream it was even greater than flying. My brother, some friends and I were hanging out in some small house near a salt-water marsh. There were all kinds of enormous waterbirds in the tidal pools and we were trying to name all of them. It was like Dr. Seuss there were so many. One of them get on its legs and started walking toward us on dry land; it must have been 6' 5". My friends start running away, but as I look at the bird more she starts to change into an unbelievably stalky woman- beautiful, but still birdlike. Seeing the transformation made me lucid and the first thing I wanted to do was run on the water. The water was soft but hardened like corn-starch with each step.

      All this talk about rooftops.  urlLink Rooftop Films  have some beautiful pictures of Brooklyn rooflines on their website. Now I sound like I'm advertising for them, but I'm not... It's making me think of the beach. Same aesthetic. Every time I'm at the beach I think about what makes it so perfect. For a long time I thought it had mostly to do with the sound, the rhythm. I never gave much thought to the visual aspect. Sunsets are beautiful. Sand dunes are beautiful. But what is it about the beach, the wide horizontal lines of the shore and the horizon? Nothing much to it. My take on it: the beach is the ultimate and infinite living room. The wide focus of the sea, the activity of the waves replaces the TV. Sand is the ultimate minimal furniture. Our choices are few yet we are completely taken care of. There's something similar about city rooftops. They are temporary hangouts- places to witness and transcend.

      Down on 3rd. St. in Park Slope is  urlLink Rooftop Films . Tonight they were showing a collection of short animations inside because it rained. It was a pretty mixed bunch of some. I really liked some of it and I hated some of it. What I really loved was the live jazz at the beginning of the performance. This drummer,  urlLink Chris Corsano , had to go alone because apparently his partner was MIA. He was going nuts. He played as he set the drums up. He put cymbals on top of his snare and toms and played things things in rough comination. He rubbed some kind of plastic tip on the drum heads that made a squeaking electronic sound. I was impressed. I should check out the duo some other time.

      Tonight, my brother was kicked out of a bar for the first time. And he turns 21 in 2 weeks. What kind of crap is that? We had such a great plan. He went in first with my id, and then my friend brought it back out. Problem is, even though they carded at the door, the bartender didn't think he looked right and carded him again.     So we had to hoof it back to Brooklyn as soon as we got there. No big deal. Neither of us has seen Rambo. What a terrific movie. Rambo is like a ronin, a wandering samurai, hated by the people.

      It's getting hotter in Brooklyn. My brother is crashing in our apartment for a few days and he's opted for the floor of my room since it's the only one that has air conditioning. We got up at one in the afternoon. Last night there was a lot of partying and playing videogames. The videogames gave me headaches. At about 1:30pm we went for a run and didn't stop sweating until about 3:30. Actually, I'm still going. The laptop on my lap isn't helping any. The nocturnal lifestyle, the constant cooking in the hot kicthen, the running, the videogames, the drinking, the jobhunt. Today I'm in the red.  But there's good news. I punched in a few key words and found out a zendo nearby. Just a 20 minute walk, actually. So my vauge plans for finding local zen nuts is slowly condensing. Only problem is I want to check it out right away, but they insist that newcomers attend their 2.5 hour Sunday "beginnner's session." I can't wait in this heat. My brother and I were going to shoot a short this week and it pisses me off that the kid who was going to lend me the camera is now backing out of it and doesn't trust me enough with the camera to just lend it to me. We've been friends for like 5 years. I have never screwed up any of his stuff. I don't get it. He says maybe next week, but my brother might not be around next week. This is just poor. I can't wait in this heat.

      What's the big deal... There's this guy at the party tonight. He's a familiar face; I've seen him around at school. I know he's gay. I know it's probably wrong to be screwing with him and hoking around with him since he was obviously really drunk. I don't know, maybe I just enjoy the attention, but I think I should just leave him alone from now on. He's left me a standing offer to experiment. I'm not at all interested. I tried to let him know that I just thought he was funny to hang out with but he just kept at me. If I bump into him again I'm going to have to speak my mind.

      There was this guy on the opposite platform with some kind of Chinese bowed instrument with really large pegs at the top. I couldn't see him, he was sitting with his back to me and an I-beam. The whole scene was framed perfectly with these I-beams; only his bow and the people walking by were horizontal. The music came in these gentle gusts, like breathing. And I imagined what it would be like to walk by him, the sound rising and falling. This other guy was visible from the downtown D at 7th Avenue. He was playing these tunes on guitar that all sounded sort of familiar but you couldn't place them. That guitar spread out; it was meant for wide-open spaces. A few listened from the top of the staircase and from neighboring platforms. I couldn't see, but I'm sure. Because he had a pure, sad sound- as if lonliness were the only clear thing. Guy walks up next to me and he knows I'm listening. He smiles and says something incomprehensible but I know he means, "isn't that music beautiful?" And I turn and smile and turn back. Kid at the bottom of the stairs doesn't know where to look either. That's what happense when you hear something so beautiful, a sound that could correspond to anything- a stranger's eyes, the train humming. The train plays guitar.

      They say when it rains it pours. I was miserable a jobless a week ago. Now I'm so busy I don't know what to do with myself. I got a job working for a NY film festival, which is the coolest thing I can be doing right now. I get to party with filmmakers, watch all kinds of stuff, and be the man. I'm also working doing nitty-gritty for the John Kerry documentary. It's mind-numbing transcription stuff, but I'm getting paid nice paper. Then I might have this part-time gig selling shoes. But they want me to work weekends... yeah, I'm not sure that's going to work out. First of all, my brother's birthday is this weekend. Already I'm not sure I want to give one weekend up, so this might prove problematic. I just saw  urlLink Tampopo  for like the eighth time. I really don't want tell you what you should and shouldn't watch, but you should watch Tampopo. It's brilliant. In fact, that's the only thing I recommend.

       urlLink    I was reading a few things about the domestication of cats yesterday and it's pretty cool stuff. There is evidence that suggests that cats were pets as early as 7500 BC, but it's more commonly believed they were domesticated by the Egyptians and revered as gods for keeping rodent populations away from the food stores. This symbiotic relationship earned the cat a lot of respect, that is, until the pope targeted them for their pagan associations and delcared them witches' familiars in the 4th century, beginning an unofficial cat inquisition. Cats were respected for such a long time that they had become a recurring image in pagan mythology; they wre most commonly associated with the Norse goddess  urlLink Freya , whose wain, or cart, was drawn by blue cats. As the Black Death spread across Europe cat-killing intensified. And as there were fewer cats to keep the rodent population down the plague got worse and people started worrying about their own survival instead. Some think that cats' return was one big factor in the Black Death's eventual recession.

       urlLink    This is one of Jasper John's targets. It reminded me of the zen  urlLink enso - the circle that represents mind, and the Target store symbol. I got involved with both in one day. Since I moved to Brooklyn a few months ago I've been looking for a zen temple, it just hasn't been a priority. This morning I finally found one and I attented services. And I did it on a hangover. First I couldn't find it at all. I knew the area pretty well, and I had studied the map so I was pissed I wasn't finding it. Right where I thought it should be there was a  urlLink Baptist  church. So I figured: ask the Baptists. They knew the area pretty well, they said, but didn't know about any Buddhist temples. They wanted me to attend service with them at 11. Turns out the temple was visible from where we were talking. Thanks, guys.   Though the neighborhood, I noticed, sported all kinds of people, the temple was full of white people of all shapes and sizes. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by an older female monk. I had never met a female monk before. When I saw people lining up in their street clothes to get in I realized immediately this was going to be a much different experience than what I was used to at the  urlLink rinzai  temple. It felt a little bit like the  urlLink Unitarian Church  I was brought up in, but with an affected austerity mostly put on by the visitors, not the monks. I attended the beginner's session, having no problems sitting there as others fidgeted. Another female monk told us about the difficulties and the rewards of zazen. Her easy smile reminded me of another monk I once knew for a short time.    After our briefing we joined the rest of the  urlLink sangha  and did 30 minutes of  urlLink zazen  and chanting, some of which I was familiar with. It was less zazen than I would have liked. There was an intense focus at the beginning. I have never sat with that many people before, and I was really impressed with the focus in the room. It trailed off a bit at about minute 15 as people coughed. Someone sneezed and it scared the shit out of me. That happens when you're sleepy.     All in all, I think the place has a very nice vibe and the head monk is a smart woman; I think I can learn something from her. On my way back home I saw the grand opening of a Target and I was so intrigued that I got off the bus and checked it out. It was unbelievable. There were hundreds of people there. It was unnavigable. The lines were incredible. There were clowns, people on stilts, people selling food. It was a like a state fair except sadly lacking in animal smells.

      It's Saturday and I'm supposed to be scouring the internet for email addresses to spam to generate interest in the festival. I mean, it's not really spam when I find filmmakers is it? I'm just burned out on a week of work and I don't want to be spending my weekend doing this. the other day I got about 100 names and that was enough work. All I can think about is: Is there a program that will do this faster? If there is, I bet it would spam thousands of innocent people who don't give a shit about movie making, so that's pretty much out.  Tonight, my brother is coming into the city for the first time since he turned 21. He spent today with some college friends and we're going to rage it tonight.

      I've been gone for a while because I was trying to screw with the blogger template settings. I leanred about HTML trying to get the whole thing back to normal. Apparently, I didn't save the code, though I thought I did... I've also been incredibly busy on the John Kerry thing. Lots of running around. I spend most of the day running between the editing office and the production office on a busy part of Broadway. It's hot work, but it pays off when you get to see Hulk Hogan getting into a limo. I saw the guy who played Pussy on the Sopranos the other day. God bless New York for random sightings... This Sunday we had our first meeting for the  urlLink Brookyln Underground Film Festival  and I got a DVD compilation of the first year on which there's this awesome piece by Vito Acconci. He's looped the MGM lion and dubbed voice over it so that it says, "You are going to die," etc. etc. Really spooky. Can't shake it.

       urlLink    I have this strange condition. Every morning I wake up with a song badly stuck in my head. It could be anything- somethiing I heard waiting to see the dentist in the early 90s. So I set my alarm to the Christian network so I'm guaranteed to wake up to a soothing voice. This morning, such an explosive chord came from the choir that I woke up with one word in my head: bomb. And I woke up so suddenly that I saw the dark area in my eyes contract into my pupils and disappear. Today I'm taking the train to my hometown. My friend's father died on Sunday and today is his memorial service.

         If nanobacterial life can fail on Mars, New Yorkers can fail too. It makes things more exciting. So I'm going to play all my chips and make it in the movie biz. That’s my story. Kids like me don't make much money, so I figured my only chance I had to save money was to not pay rent, which is what I'm doing living on a kitchen floor. Nobody is objecting yet, but I haven't met two out of three of my roommates. I cleaned it spotless, no worries. I stashed my toiletries (what a stupid word) under the sink, my airmatress and my few clothes up in the cupboard, and I'm good. Then there's my wok and that's all I own that isn't in store in my parents' house out in   Michigan  … which I won’t go into.

      Oh what a weird day. I bumped into Martin Scorsese as I got off an elevator in the editing building. I had to walk between him and somebody else to get where I was going, so I said, "excuse me," and he said, "sure." Technically, I had dialogue with Scorsese. Later on I got dinner with a girl from work at Costa Del Sol and had octupus. It was amazing. As we went home I realized I had the office men's room key. Just now I realized I left a felt tip pen in the pocket of my favorite jeans and they're ruined. And I'm copying and pasting email addresses by the dozens for  urlLink Brooklyn Underground Film Festival . I'm burning out.

      On 9th St. and 6th Ave. in Park Slope there is a fresh bar called Barbie that, as far as I know, has no relation to the stupid girlie doll. I think it's supposed to be pronounced as a French person would... maybe Barbie dolls are French. What the hell do I know? They had a very cool bar in there- smelled like good wine, and a band playing gypsy music, a guy playing the spoons. Unbelievable.

      So last night my brother and a few of our friends from home went out on the town. It was great to finally be able to take him to all my haunts since he just recently turned 21. We started out at this party at the Chinaroom, which was supposedly an exclusive club at one time, but I wasn't really into it. Expensive drinks, bad techno. My brother's friends are all younger and I can remember going to clubs and wondering why I wasn't having a good time. And now I know that it wasn't because I was the youngest kid there. It was the expensive drinks and the bad techno. So to give them some contrast I took them to Siberia, a big dive on 40th and 9th Ave. marked only with a red light outside. The looks on my brother and his friends' faces said, "this is it?" And then they were genuinely shocked when the bouncer laid down the rules: No cursing, no hitting on women. I tried to explain why this wasn't uncommon among the quieter hip dives, but I still don't totally understand. I think they're trying to keep out jocks. It was kind of a thrill going to all of my favorite grungy bars in nice shoes, slacks and tucked-in, buttoned-down shirts... We ended up cabbing it back to Brooklyn and waiting as my friend took the subway back; he was too drunk to drive his car home from Times Square. And we passed out to an episode of Northern Exposure. What a weekend.

       urlLink    Living on someone's courch is a delicate balance between making yourself useful and making people believe you're not really there. But eventually they all realize they want you gone. Park Slope is great. It's a lot more comfortable for me than Williamsburg and I really want to stay here. So I looked up a friend of mine from a movie I did a few months back and gave him my pitch: I'll cook and clean for you if I can crash in your kitchen and not pay rent. The couch pitch is always awkward, but at least it's straight forward. People form an opinion of you living on their couch pretty quickly. But I figured living in someone's kitchen could be even less intrusive if approached correctly and given compatible people.  First of all, you need people who don't cook a lot, which these dudes don't. You need to convince people that an unused kitchen is wasted space. Then people need some convincing that it's not going to be weird having someone sleeping in the kitchen. That's not really too difficult, once people get an idea of how few my possessions are and that I'll clean the place up first. I borrowed my brother's self-inflating mattress and I can roll that up every morning and that's that... M has run it by his other roommates. He says they've got a nice big kitchen and they're cool with it. I move in tomorrow.
