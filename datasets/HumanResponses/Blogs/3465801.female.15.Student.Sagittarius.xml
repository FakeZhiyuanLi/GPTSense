      oh joy, i have passed one week with nothing to do and only a little bit into my goal, which i believe russell knows, for the summer. and it just so happens to be ridiculously hot in my house, at a cool sixty five degress. but it is hot...how does this happen? i think i am a fish. so i am dressing like you would at hattie's house, with poor ol' kasidey feeling all uncomfortable, only my brother is the one who is confused. oh the joys of winning the battle. it is so strange how one puny little eighteen year old can belittle me to an idiot in a matter of seconds by proving how i lack a lot of real world sensibility such as seeing my door knob, which just so happens to be right in front of my face. my dad has also shown me that i am probably in my heart of hearts for nader....yea this came as a shock to me since i want to get bush out of office and being for nader won't help. AT ALL. it's not like i can vote anyway...although even if it does turn out that i am for nader, i will still help out kerry. this is because, not including politics and other actually important factors, we share the same birthday and his last name is my brother's middle name.  hey look at how i have babbled! if you actually read all this i am so very proud of you, and also wondering why you are so crazy to do such a thing. oh well..   p.s. i was watching colonial house today(i dont have cable*screams*) and the english guy named dominic is really hot...just so you know.

      i am ridiculously bored right now and on the computer to escape the fact that i recieved my report card. i made a really bad grade on my english exam(i cried for thirty minutes), however i still have a 4.5, which baffles me beyond belief. oh the joy of having just one screw up.  ya know what's sad? i kinda wish school was still in, not for the freshman thing, but i would still see my friends, and i wouldn't have to do the evil pre ap english assignment...please someone tell me why i am subjecting myself to this torture again? i thonk i'll go listen to coldplay later. maybe there uselees trants will make me feel better.(i say useless b/c nobody listens) btw why would you name your daughter apple? i like weird names, but i mostly go for ancient ones NOT my favorite fruit. geesh....celebrities can be so odd.  my phantom count---i have watched it three times already this week. i wish i were catherine zeta-jones...life would be so much easier: i'd have an oscar, been in chicago, be able to sing, and not be stuck in memphis! and finally....i did my yoga today and did not hurt myself! that makes me happy. now i have a bit more than 60 days to keep doing yoga.....thats the only good part of summer...not really, but yea you get the point

      yes...i am in a funky mood. why did i make one of these again? oh yes...cuz i was bored...oh well, i could care less. i finally recovered from my yoga injury, which is nice since it isnt cool to have a yoga injury, so i shall leave soon to do yoga...and my brother has been speaking in an austrian accent..it is quite odd and rather scary. summer is boring. i want to go see the day after tomorrow...and trust me, i will muwahahahaha...just kidding, i am not going to kill anybody. much love, kristen

      grrrr....my purse has been on backorder for about 2 weeks! are they just trying to piss me off or do the enjoy to get mean, vindictive emails from upset fifteen year olds who spent all their money on a stupid purse?!?! ok....whew now that that entire thing is out of the way i must say, since no one reads this and i basically write this for myself, that yelling on the internet is a very good way to let out all of your bitter i hate the world emotions....let's see the most i have done since i last wrote my few little words is get sat on by my brother(which is not so fun for those of us who enjoy breathing) and i was on the bus and our bus driver tried to run over two people, hit three cars, and read the paper....all while drivong a full bus downtown at 7 something in the morning...oh the joy of mass transit....ok maybe something joyful will happen and i will have something else to say soon....  kristen
