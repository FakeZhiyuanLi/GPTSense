      Been a few days since my last post. It's been a rough week, with being sick. On top of that, I got a flu shot at work Wednesday, and naturally, it made me sick.  I got home from work, booted up, sent a quick note to my Spanish teacher that I wouldnt be in for class, and then went to bed and slept for 14hrs.  Had a fever slightly over 100, and today I still have the fever, but went into work because I had things that had to get done.  I'm home for a half-day for not feeling well.  I'm on-call, hopefully the CME   we're going to get hit with from the sun in a few hrs doesn't effect my cell phone too much as I'm on-call.  The solar flare is going to cause distruption they figure for 12-18hrs.   Sounds like we're all headed out of town to work on our trailer that we rent out.  Oh boy oh joy.  Fixing a ceiling fan thats brand new and shouldn't have issues but apprently does, plumbing, racking up rocks that our EX tenant put all over the yard, that she never asked about.   So now I get to rack up and get rid of how knows how many pounds or river rock due that @#$@# we had living there.  Being a landlord sucks.

      Well....the weekend has past more quickly then I wanted it to (whats new).  I've spent a couple of hours, studying for the last test in my Spanish 101 class.  I'm back in college through the tuition re-emburstment program at work, and have decided to finish my degree. What better way to do it then to start off with a language, right?  The classes are 2 nights a week, 2hrs long, and they go for 2months at a time.  It's called a TimeSavers program.  Not sure who it's saving time for, doesnt seem to be me.  Between work, school, and Scouts, doesn't seem like alot of time left.     Today's been a sort of recovery day for me, woke up in the middle of the night with a migraine.  I get one ever 2-3 weeks it seems.  Often enough that I take medication to help prevent them and medication for once I do get one.  No clue why I get them, I've suffered from them since I was 5yrs old.    Went out and put in a couple holes in our local Frisbee golf course.  I had a argument with the wife, and I needed to get out of the house and away from her.  The course isn't the place to go when mad though.  There are a few er.... really steep areas, and it doesn't work to go trumping up them in a huff.. only makes you more tired.  Decided to do a couple of the holes on the back 9, and on the way back, I climbed down into the revene, and took it most of the way back up to the front of the course, keeping my eyes peeled for any discs laying around.  That's how I found the Frisbee golf disk I have now (www.discraft.com). It's different from playing with a Whamo(C) brand Frisbee. Back then I played with the big white 151gram disk.  Lots of hang time with those old ones. The discs you use now are the size of a large saucer/small dinner plate, and man, do they throw totally different.   I used to play Disc Golf alot when I was a teen...it's awesome to be playing it again.  My oldest is getting into it and wants his own Golf Disc now too. Already told him thats something I'd happily take for Christmas  .   Still working on getting over this cold, had it going on 3-4 weeks now and I sure to look forward to not coughing all the time, and always feeling very run-down.  Ever dread getting up in the morning because your exhausted? Thats how I've felt the last 3 weeks.  I REALLY look forward to this cold being gone.  Almost as much as being done with Spanish 101 tomorrow night  .  Star Trek:Enterpries was decent Saturday.  Hoshi, the communications officer is telepathically contacted by a funky looking huminoid with feelers or something on his head.  He can easily read Hoshi's mind, and at the end, tries to trick her into staying. He just makes a few blaring faults that she catches, and returns to her ship. He's able to hold an ojbect and get mental impressions left on it by whomever build it/last touched it or something, and is able to help send Capt Archer in the right direction, to find a colony of Xindi who are building part of a weapon to destroy the earth.  Looks to be quite the story arc, which is a nice change for Trek.  I loved how DS9 did it all the time, and it's nice to see ST:Enterprise doing the same thing :-)

      Ok, time for a Star Trek post!  Ok, the latest and greastest in the line of Star Trek tv Shows has been "Enterprise".  As of just the last few weeks, it has FINALLY been changed to "Star Trek:Enterprise".  Like all series in the ST francise, it seems that around Season 3 the show really hits it stride and takes off.  Star Trek: The Next Generation (here after called ST:TNG) really took off with "The Best of Both Worlds, Parts 1 & 2.   DS9  (Deep Space Nine)...well...thats sorta my favorite right now, so it hit it's stride early on. Voyager got better as soon as Janeway let that bun down. Any one would be crabby if your hairs wound so tight it's pulling it out by the roots!      Enterprise had an OK first two seaons. Several episodes really stood out..and some really stunk too.  People complain about how the Enterprise NX-01 can look so modern compared to what it looked like in the original series with Kirk in command.  My answer on it? They have to make it look primitive and crappy because the first show it's based on was from 25odd years ago, that it has to have crappy special effects now?  Hell  no..  why should they?  So it just doesn't match up...it's not done in an age of fantastic effects.  But we have them now, so lets use 'em!  Now with Season 3 of Star Trek:Enterprise under way, we're finally getting to see alien species that are totally CGI (Computer Generated Image).  They look way awesome and it's about time they started doing this.  The crew is totally on their own in a very hostile area of space. They have some Federation Marines   on-board for combat situations. Capt. Archer and crew are trying to find the home world of the Xindi, a "species" that has it out to destroy Earth.  There are 5 different kinds of Xindi and they are all completely different from one another.    Capt. Archer is very much different this season. He's harder, more seasoned, grown a back-bone. He's so far looked like he's willing to do whatever it takes, and on occassion crossing the line to make it happen.    Well....thats it for this entry, will follow up with more soon.

      Hello! Welcome to my Web Blog!  I'm Kromwell, a pleasure to meet you!  Please pardon the mess as I move in and get things arranged the way I want them.  I'll start off a little about myself.  I'm a 35yr old Computer Tech, living in Dubuque Iowa.  I'm married, to Zelda (in-case you want to read her blogg, she's here on Blogger), and have 2 awesome kids.  We're all very active with Cub Scouts.  I have a few hobbies, so I'll mention them... I'm very into computers, hence my occupation. I seem to have a strange and twisted knack with them.  I've built more pc's then I care to remember since I started working with PC's.  I got started with computers in 1980 when I got my computer, a Timex Sinclair 1000.  Through junior high and high school, I took everthing I could about computers. In 1987 I went to school for programming, and that was pretty much all she wrote. I've been working with IBM Compatabiles since then, and haven't looked back.  I was writing about hobbies though, so let me get back to that.  My other primary hobby, would be Star Trek.  What can I say?  I love it.  I collect the Playmate brand Star Ship's, and also have the 2 released by Art Asylum.  I have various items around the room that would make it obvious that I'm too much into star trek... like the Star Trek clock, the 2 pieces of art, the mouse pad on the wall, or the Klingon Action Figure sitting on the korner of the desk?   Oh, not to mention the Klingon ensignia thats attached to the front of my monitor, or my DS9 Uniform top with phaser and tricorder?  Hopeless aint I? LOL   Lets talk Cub Scouts now.  I've been an active leader now, going on my 4th year. I've a Pack Leader now, and have had my current den of boys since they started as Wolf scouts.   We have a pretty fun time too! Personally, I think the best pack meeting is when we do Pine Wood Derby!  That is such a fun event, and the boys love it! Wish we did it more often.    Well, thats my thoughts for the day.

      I hope that everyone who views this meager little blog had a very Happy Thanksgiving, and a safe one.  We made a 2hr+ drive each way, and had a pretty fun day.  We did the olbigatory turkey and trimmings, plus lots of games, listening to the wife play her guitar (note, she's getting really good!).  We got to see my in-laws new dog Scooter, a stray female black lab.  Really friendly, and a ball of energy just waiting to rupture.    Got a new toy tonight, and all I can say is, let it snow!  My dad had a snowblower that he gave us. They made a spur of the moment visit out and brought it out with them.  It's an old John Deere.  If we have the snowfall that they claim we'll get this winter, it'll really be worth having.  The kids already want me to blow the whole yard into a big pile for them to build a huge snowfort out of lol  Friday after thanksgiving. Just mentioning that makes me think of the feeding frenze that goes on at the malls on this day.  I read that the average consumer will spend $672 on presents for Christmas.  I try to make it a point to do the opposite and sit at home.  Malls?  Treat 'em like the plague on this day. Traffic will be unreal, other shoppers will be mean, rude, nasty, and just out sub-human in general.  At least thats how it felt when I worked in retail.    I worked for about 3½yrs for a Software Etc.  The pay sucked, but the discount on software and books was well worth it.  At Christmas time, people tended, instead of becoming inbued with the holiday spirit, wanted to tear you a new one because you don't have the green Nintendo 64 controller that they wanted and its ALL YOUR FAULT.  Nothing like being in the spirit of the season and being nice to your fellow humans.  Anyway...     Picked up the Extended edition of The Two Towers on tuesday.  It has 43 minutes of extended/restored footage included directly into the movie. This makes it 243 minutes long.  Thank goodness for the pause feature. My bladders good but not that good.  They really are doing such an incredible job on these movies.  The restored  footage really adds to the movie, and makes you wonder why they were cut except to reduce the over-all length of the flick.  I watched the special feature on Gollum, and all I can say, is  wow , thats just the neatest shit on the face of the earth!  The guy who did Gollum is just incredible. He does the voice perfectly, he does almost all of the actual body movements for the CGI character to replicate, and just all the phsyical stuff he had to go through. His screentest is something else. They said he was hired almost from the get-go based on the screentest. He really got into character and had it nailed almost perfect right away.  This is a must to add to the collection if you like Tolkein.  All I know is I can't wait for the Return of the King to hit the theaters, just to see what happens next (and I've read the books) :)

      Well, we survived our campout.  We spent the night at Camp Little Cloud, the console camp for our local Girl Scouts.  I tell you what, the two cabins we stayed in, were nicer then what I live in.  The cabin we stayed in, had a wood burning stove upstairs, a spiral staircase going downstairs, 2 bedrooms, and a bathroom.  In the basement was the kitchen, another bathroom with a shower, a piano,  and another door leading outside.     The only draw back to the entire place?  Not a single curtain in the whole place.  Was very odd., but from what I could see, there was only a family camping in a larger building. We had 20 people total show up, so we had 10 to a building.  We had a great time!  We did a hike, taking the Scouts down to the lake, and walking around it, and then hiking up a steep hill through the leaves, and trees. We stopped several times on the way up as it was hot work, in the 45+ degree temps.  At the top of the hill we took another break, but this time got to sit on the edge of a platform that in the summer time would be occupied by a teepee.  There were five teepee platforms, and two buildings. The cabin itself, had a huge glass front to it, that formed a wedge facing south. Would of been awesome to see a sunrise from there.  At this point, we had gravel rode, and took it a half-mile back to our area.  It was very surine in the area were we walked through a bunch of pine trees. The sounds changed when we entered. Almost like when you realize you've just entered the "Haunted Forrest".     We had left two or three leaders back at camp as we had started a fire and they were monitoring it.  We showed the Scouts how building a "log cabin fire", the wood stacked like a log cabin would be, burns fast and gives you a good bed of coals to work with.  We had the boys go up to the cabins kitchen four at a time, to make foil packs.  Basically they got a piece of aluminum foil 12x12.  They then put on some of following based on their own choice: hamburger, onions, carrots, potatoes,     salt, pepper, seasoning salt.  You just pile what you want into the middle of your aluminum foil square, and fold it up, so it's sealed.  Write your name on the outside with a nice magic marker, then take it to the fire, and have a leader sit it right in the coals.  After 10minutes or so, the leader will flip it over, and cook the other side.    MMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, did it taste good.  I had some hamburger, onions, potatos, all the seasonings, and a little catchup.   Boy did it taste good!    My assisant leader had brought the makings for a popcorn popper, and had some of the Scouts help him put it together.  Basically, you take two bread pans, and you get a piano type hinge. You drill holes through the side lip on the bread pan, and pop rivet the hinge on.  Get a strip of aluminum, and you can easily hand bend it, shape it to one end of the breadpan, with about 4-5 inches extending past.  You drill and attach it the same way to the pan.  Then, take a fairly straight branch, or something roughly a 2x2, thats 4ft long or so.  You use some screws into the extended part of the aluminum strip, and attach it to the handle.  Then, you take and punch a hole from the inside of the pan, and run a screw into the handle, attaching it from there too.     You now have a handy dandy popcorn popper, that you can give a quick shake, to open it up and dig in!  We made some kettle corn. It's made the same way as regular popcorn but you add some sugar to the oil.    A good clean up tip?  Rub some dish soap on the outside of the pan, when you go to clean it up, the soot from the fire will just wipe off easily, instead of discoloring the pans.

      Well, this is the weekend... I'll be taking our CubScout Pack out camping tomorrow. We'll spend roughly 24hrs together in the woods. We'll have buildings to stay in, as we're not staying at the districs normal camp, Camp Burton.  We should have about 20-25 people going.  We'll take the kids out on a couple of nature hikes, during the day and at night.  I'm going to take my telescope along, so we can do alittle astronomy work.  During the night hike, I'll show them how to find the north star, how to locate the milky way, and various constellations.  We usually have a great time.

      Well, not much to really say today.  We've been busy it seems since our trip to BestBuy saturday. We picked up "Mech Assault" for the XBox.  This game, is done by Microsoft, with the auspices of FASA, the group that created BattleMech in the 80's, later to become MechWarrior.  All I can say about this game?  AWESOME!  My sons and I have wanted it for awhile, and we couldn't pass up the game, as it was marked down to $19.95, down from $49.99.  If you've ever had the urge to run around in giant robots, armed to the teeth, this game is for you.  We've probably put in 2-4hrs a day since we got it.  I've made it quite far along in the campain mode, playing progressivly harder missions.  The soundtrack is awesome, the graphics are just as excellent.  I can't say enough good things about this game.  Both my boys, ages 10 and 7, are both enamered with the game, something I've been, since I started playing the BattleMech rpg game.  I've played all 4 Mech games on the PC, and some of the expansion packs.  If you want action, adventure, and just a good time blowing stuff up, this game series is for you.   Being that the Xbox, has a 733mhz Pentium III coppermine CPU, 128megs of memory, a special video chip from Nvidia, and high fidelity audio, it's hard to wonder why the games on it compare to the PC, as it basically is a PC, running a special version of Windows 2000.  With Mech Assault, Microsoft defintely came out with a winner and it makes me wish we had the XBox-Live service, so we could play other MechWarriors from around the world to see how we measure up.

      Well, we've hit the big time. As of 9am yesterday, we now have a Best Buy.  It's been under construction for some time now, and finally opened it's doors.  I decided to swing by, as they had a special on CD-R's, a 50pk for $4.99.  Well, go figure, by the time I got there shortly after work, they were sold out. I found out at the cash register that they had a substitute, but go figure, that one was sold out too.  It's an impressive store, and it was impressivly packed.  There were so many people there, that I decided to just get the movie I wanted then, as they had The Matrix Reloaded for $15.  I was going to walk down the computer goodies isles, but they were so jam packed, that I decided to not try and do my impersonation of a salmon going upstream.  It was nice having the store open, as McDonalds has been doing their Monopoly game, and they have had stickers for $1, $5, and $10 for use at Best Buy.  I had my little slip in hand with 7 of them, so my Matrix Reloaded cost $9.  Sweet deal.  I had the evening to my self since the family was out of town, so I sat down and watched it. The special effects are awesome. Just like the 1st movie, but 200% better. The only draw back was in the Agent's Smith fight scene, it was very obvious that it was CGI, and poor CGI at that.  Still impressive, but it didn't look like the actors  what-so-ever.  Well, off to start my Saturday, hope everyone has a good weekend, will post again later.

      We got to go see the US Marine Corp Band yesterday. Or, as they are called, The President's Own.  I heard more volume and sound out of this band, then I have from college Marching bands with 200 people.  I must say, if you ever have an opportunity to see this band play, it's most worth while.  Every member of the band is a member of the Marine Corp's.  What I found a little missleading on that part, if I understood it correctly, they are members of the Marine Corp, but never have to go through Basic Training, and are generally exempt from that type of training. They are assigned TO the band and basically nothing else.  They get an automatic rank of Ssgt  , an E-6.  It takes most people on active duty 5-7yrs to get that rank.    The music itself, is incredible. They play alot of John Philip Sousa, and they played some songs from Broadway as well.  The conductors, whom I don't recall their names, are a Col. and  a Major.  There was also a gentleman who came out and introduced each song, and gave a little background on it. He sang the National Anthem, and also in the second half of the performance, sang three more songs. He can sing most excellently.  I was very impressed.    The concert was held at the high school.  We ended up in seats on the 2nd floor, toward the middle edge of the basketball court.  There was local law enforcement to help out, as well as some active duty troopers pulling security. The local AmVets were helping out as well.  There were probably 1500-2000 people in attendance.  I know, if they are back next year, we'll make sure to go see them again, they put on a fantastic show.

      Well, we made it home about 11:35 from the Indian Pow wow held at the U OF W Platteville.  We didn't get too lost on the way up. We got on campus, found a LARGE map with one of those "U R Here" dots on it, figured out roughly where we wanted to go, and still got a hair lost on the way.  We back-tracked a ways and found the turn that we had missed.  We thought we knew the building to go to, but it turned out to be the Student/Technology Center. Pamela ventured a door to an Information  [I think]  area. She found a small pile of maps of the campus; we looked at it, went out front and determined we just needed to go one building over.    We went in, and started looking at the vendors booths as we had 20-25 minutes to spare. There was some really excellent examples of hand-made Indian jewelry.  Some of the outfits as usuall are stunning. The time and effort that must go into making their costumes has to be astounding.  We made our way 2/3'rds around the vendors, when we run into a mother in Pamela's Wolf-Den for scouts.  We had mentioned the Pow wow to her yesterday at a field trip we had out to the E.B Lyons Nature Center. She's from Jamaica, and was very interested.   She had been up there since 2pm'ish, so by this time she had been there 4hrs.  During the evening, when the audiance could join in the dancing, she hopped up 4 or 5 times to join in.    To be honest, I was tempted to get up and join in, but felt a little apprehenceive wearing a blue Hawaiin shirt, and how it's stick out.  There was one point that Pamela had gone off to the ladies room, that if she had been back, I was going to get up during the group dance part, and try my hand at a Friendship dance.  I tried to talk my oldest son into it but he always said no. I asked Pamela but she said the next Pow wow.  I'm making note of it here so she doesn't forget :) Time to call it a night, will give a better detail of it later today its late and time to pay Winkin, Blinkin and Nod a visit.

      I want to say  Thank You  to my  wife , for all the work she did on my Blog last night. She set it up so I can have comments on my blog, and a picture of me   and a mood indicator. Watching her edit the template and posting html code here, and typing some in by hand there, I can definitely say she knows her way around a web page. Shes only had a webpage since '96, when Geocities was the only real place offering a free web page. She was once a featured website, and there was only 1 of those at a time, once a month.  She does an  awesome  job with the sites, and is  amazing , to me, who works with  pc's , but not  html .  We got our popcorn today, for our CubScouts to deliver.  After unloading all of it, it was nice for a change that our sons only had a little amount to deliver.  Everything went pretty smoothly for the most part and kids maybe knocking on YOUR door to deliver something you ordered.  Everything we do as a CubScout Pack during the year is funded by what we earn from our popcorn sales.  Last spring we were able to purchase a new 2-lane all-aluminum 35ft long track.  Wow, is it awesome to run the derby on that! Our race night seemed to go by fairly quickly.  My assistant leader and I even set it up at another school for their CubScout Pack's derby. They haven't had one before, and we volunteered to help out, and it gave us an excuse to show off and use our new track.   We had 24 kids racing, using a double elimination, and we were done raceing in 45 minutes. Was amazing, our own pack races don't go that fast.   We're going to make a trip up to the University of Platteville Wisc tonight. They are having an Indian Pow wow.  This will be our second one this year, and our 3rd one total, together.  Should be quite interesting.  After going to the Tama Pow wow on August 7th, this one will be nicer, as it wont be boiling hot outside, and we'll understand it and appreciate it a little more as well.  The costumes are incredibly detailed, and the dancers are very good at what they do.  It's an awesome experience, one  I think everyone should experience for themselves.

      Well, we safely made our Christmas trek to my parents house.  We almost didn't make it back in the same shape though.  We were on Hwy 20, just going past Victory Ford heading east.  We were coming down the hill, and a white Audio pulls out to head east as well.  Unfortunetly this person decided they DIDN'T want to pull into the in-side lane  (they hopefully still teach in drivers ED that when you make a turn you pull into the lane closest to you) and pull into our lane.  I was going 65mph, and slowed down some, but this guy, just goes in front of us. I started laying on the horn and had to jerk the car onto the shoulder to avoid rear-ending them.  THEN...I'm trying to get back onto the road and the guy is STILL there and practically on my bumper. I had to speed up to get back onto the road.  All the while, I was still honking the horn.  PLUS, he had his high-beams on.    After I got back onto the pavement, and got back upto 65mph, the Audi was hanging back about a quarter mile.  I waited for him to speed up, as I figured this @#)$(*@ was the kind of person who loves to speed, and then I got his liscense plate # and called 911.  They pulled onto the HWY from a supper club area, and I figured they had to be drinking.  I was on the phone with 911 as I tried to help  keep an eye on the Audi, so they could get this person.  Unfortunetly they didnt.  They asked that if they did find him, if I would pull up behind the Sherrif and wait for him to approach me to discuss what happened.  My main concern was that after I got the ok from the Sherrif to get out, that I'd run up and beat this person, as they almost caused a major auto accident and endangered the lives of my wife and my children.   I hope that the bad karma this person has building-up catches up to him..

      Just not having the grandest time of late.  At least I'm 95-98% over this flu. All I seem to have left is some coughing, and getting tired easier then usual.    But, the work day is done, on to home.    Been playing Unreal Tournament 2003 since last Wednesday.  I had issues trying to get it to run on my system, a 1.5ghz+, 256megs of memory, and a GeForce2 GTS video card with 32megs of ddr ram. The darn thing should of run.  Well, I've put in a Radeon 9600 Pro.  It handles UT2k3 bigtime now. The video quality, the frame rates, the speed.  Wow... I don't miss the GeForce2 card at all.  At least I got this right.  Well.....Christmas is just around the corner.  Three days to go now and counting.  It's a Happy, Cheerful time of year.  At least I think it is......

      Nothing like having caught the flu, when you had a flu shot 2 months ago.  I was in Cedar Falls removing some things from the shed at our trailer, before we sold it. It was cold, and raining, and I was standing in it, moving ladders, and a Weider weight bench into the back of a friends pickup truck.  Spent probably 30-45 minutes doing this.  Well....I ended up staying home wednesday from work not feeling well.  Thrusday wasn't bad. Friday was not fun, I felt run-down, coughing, sneezing, aching, I sound like a Ny-Quil ad yet?  So the flu really kicked in on me Friday night.  I spent most of yesterday, w/o a shred of energy, but I still managed to pull up the box with our Christmas Tree, and 3 boxs of ornamints from our basement. That about ran my batteries totally down.  About 8:30, my head was throbbing and pounding from a migraine the flu was giving me.  I think that a can of soup that I had earlier in the evening was a bit off, and I got a little food poisoning from it, as it wasn't too long before I was in the bathroom praying to the toilet diety. It's amazing how sometimes just throwing up can make you feel better.    Today has been alot better.  I have some more energy, though my body still aches from the flu.  Well, this along is running me down, so I'm going to stop for now, will post again in a day or two.

      Looks like we get to see winter show up finally. We're suppose to expect between 4 to 7 inches of snow by 6am. Should be interesting.  Wonder how the new snow blower will work on it.  Todays been a Monday in hiding. Raining all day, cloudy, the day ends in Y again..  Nothing else to report.

      Not much to say today. I'm trying to not be jealous I guess (apparently Jealousy is good in life, I personally think it sucks. Should't have to have that emotion in your life period)  My left leg has just been hurting horribly the last few days.  For the last three weeks its ached and hurt in general. Its been between about 5inches down from my hip, to a few inches above my knee.  It doesnt feel like the muscle, feels like it hurts in the bone.  I haven't hit it against anything, falling, lifted anything too heavy.. it just hurts.  And when it really starts to hurt it gets there.    It made me think of the chart they gave my wife Z*lda when she had some outpatient surgery a few months ago. They rate pain based on a zero to 10 scale, 10 being the worst.  Last night I would have rated the pain around a 6-7.  It was enough I was almost crying from it.  I know I know... I must not be a real man..but it really hurt!  I've tried several different pain killers, and even gave Naproxin a shot (known over the counter as Aleve).  Well...it didn't Aleve anything. I took some about 11:45, and it's not stopped hurting one bit in the last 5hrs.  Living with pain just sucks in general.

      What can I say, it's another day that ends in Y.  Y am I here, Y do I think, Y do I try, Y do I care....nothing but Y's.  Course, it's a Monday so that says 90% of it.  I figure it's just part of the roller coaster of life that we're on.     Weather is colder today then it was yesterday. We hit 52/53 and went out for a hike on one of the trails at the Mines of Spain State Park here in Dubuque. Parts of the trail, that were on the side of the bluff, were fairly muddy and slick. When you consider at some points how steep the trail is, you don't really want mud under your feet.  Other then that, it's a really fun hike.   When we got to the top we were at the Julian Dubuque Monument.  My wife Z*lda was telling me, that the monument originally built by the Native Americans in this area, was made out of wood, with holes  so you could see Julian Dubuque's body. They have since redone the monument, so that it looks like a giant rook from Chess, made out of huge blocks of limestone (I believe anyway).  We spotted an eagles nest on the Illinois side of the Mississippi. It wasn't hard to find, those things aren't exactly little.  Watched some more of the 1st CD from "The Two Towers" Extended Edition DVD set.  It's just such an incredible set of movies.  The 4 disk set is the only way to go. I'm still enjoying the extra scenes they put back in, from the book, that just give the movie that extra edge/detail it needs. Granted, I still cant sit through the whole thing w/o a trip to the bathroom. 3hrs 43minutes is just too long for 1 sitting and a large pop.   It's now officially December, and that means only 23 more shopping days till Christmas and Santa are here! (oh, wait, I've seen santa probably 3 different places already, scratch his part LOL)

      Can it get any colder?  Wait....forget it, it can.  It seems like it's getting colder every day.   Today when I left to go in to work at 7:20, it was -11f.  Thats entirely too cold in my opinion.  With the windchill we got down to -25 to 35 below.  Our old crappy furnace has been working over-time just trying to keep it 62 in the house, when the thermostat's set to 70.    When I got up I went outside and started the car up, so it would be warmed up by the time I had to leave.  I had a wal-mart bag of snacks to take to work with me, along with a 6pack of 24oz Diet Pepsi's.  By the time I got into the car, the pop had gone from room temperature, to fridged.  Was good and cold to drink that's for sure.    Short entry here, it's FRIDAY  (WOOHOOOOO) , and I'm just thinking that it's finally nap time.  Hope everyone has a safe, and WARM weekend!  We're going to hit a balmy 15 above tomorrow.

      Ok....this is getting old.  I spent alot of Saturday with the feeling in the right side of my head, that I had  a migraine  just waiting to jump out of the closet onto my back.  I went to bed early Saturday, around 9:30pm. Getting old sucks.   Sunday after getting a decent nights sleep, I still had that tell-tale pressure in my right temple.  Well, about 4pm, the oldest and I went on a run to the store as we needed cat litter, chocolate moo, and ice cream.  Stupid me didn't wear sunglasses, so the late afternoon sun was beaming me right in the eyes most of the way home.  That was enough to push  my migraine button  the rest of the way.  About 5, I took 1000mg of ibuprofen (sorry if it's misspelled, hate the word anyway lol), and one of my migraine meds.  About 5:30 I decided it was time to lay down. My wife Z*lda asked if there was anything she could do, and I asked her to call the ER. One of the guys at work gets migraines and he has his wife take him to the ER, where they give him a shot of demeral, and 30minutes later, he's out and not having to experience the pain.  Well, she called the Ask-oh-nurse, and was connected to a hospital in Des Moines.  The lady sounds like she went down her little chart, sounding like she was agreeing with Z*lda on everything, and I ended up staying home, and spent another 45minutes feeling like the vessels in my right temple were trying to escape from my body (felt like they almost made it too).    The nurse did say "if he throws up bring him in right away", which didn't make sense to me, as I almost ALWAYS throw up when I get a migraine.  Hell, it feels bad, but, it does seem to make it go away faster.  Why would they want me to come in only IF I puke?  Go Figure.    I'd of rather got the demeral shot.  I would of slept through the night. As it was, I woke up about 9pm, thought I felt ok, then about 30 seconds later, Mr. Migraine said FU and looked me in the eye again.  So I rolled over and went back to sleep.  Then I woke up about 11:45pm. Lights on in the living room, and the house was very quiet.  So I got up, since Mr Migraine had finally given up and me and went to beat mercelessly on someone else.  Z*lda was on the couch snoozing, but woke up right away.  Oldest boy was in his bed reading some of the AWESOME book Harry Potter 5.  Littlest boy was playing with transformers (I think) on the floor.   Got him to brush his teeth finally and crawl into bed (12:30AM. for being 7 he sure is a night owl).  I finally went back to bed, and go figure, it took me until 4:15am to get back to sleep.  Then to top it off, having some of the most odd-ball dreams ever. (can anyone say astronaught?)  Well, the old alarm clock went off at 6:45, and my "no freaking way" meter pegged out.  I got up, and got stuff organized as I had to take our pc into work, were I was doing some digitization of video. Must say, that is some way fun stuff!  Put in the full/busy day at work, and then at 6:20, went to school for my 1:15 of learning to program in Visual Basic.net.  This is going to be a very kewl programming language to learn.  My copy of Visual Studio (academic copy) has arrived at the book store, now to figure out how to pay for it, as I just learned I'm not taking enough credits for my student loans Tuesday to be accepted.  I'll get it figured out somehow.  Oh, to top it off on Monday? Mr. Migraine was back, trying to invade the left side of my head this time.  Sometime, I'm going to be a REALLY big stick and give him some of his own back.  At least I fended him off, and he didn't get the better of me.    So, after the long day at work, the long evening, I get home from school, and what do I do? Throw in the Hulk.  Z*lda took the boys down and rented video games, and they had The Hulk previously viewed for $10.  I'll write up a review to post another day. I have mixed feelings about it, both good and bad (coming from an old comic book collector)  So as Stan Lee would say,   Excelsior!

      Tonight as the start of class again for me. I'm a student at  Clarke College , in their TimeSavers program. Basically it's an accelerated class for working people, to be able to take classes at night. Usually the classes are 2hrs, 2x a week, for 8 weeks.   The class I'm in, Introduction to Programming, is still 2x a week but it's only 1:15 a night, and runs through the 1st week of May.  I think having the full four months will be helpful.  I've done programming, for fun, and for a living.  Last time I programmed, was as a student learning C++.  After taking C++, I decided I actually liked COBOL better.   This class should be fun, as we'll be learning to program in Visual Basic.  This is something I've never done. I'm enthused about the class, and looking forward to a positive experience this semester! :-)

      It was a very short lived series shown on FOX.  For some reason these twits pulled it after showing only 10 episodes.  Here's the write-up on the back of the boxed set out now on DVD:  "Five hundred years in the future there's a whole new frontier, and the crew of the Firely-class spaceship  Serenity  is eager to stake a claim on the action. They'll take any job, legal or illegal, to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table. But things get a bit more complicated after tthey take on a passenger wanted by the new totalitarian Alliance regime. Now they find themselves on the run, desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eatting Reavers who live on the fringes of space."  Some of the ways they did things on this show REALLY made me wonder why Star Trek:Enterprise can't be more like this show?  You had a cast of 9 characters, who almost always interacted together for every episode they aired.  Mal is the Captain, Zoe is the XO, Wash (Zoe's hubby) is the pilot, Jayne the mentally-off musle of the group, Simon (doctor), and his sister River (hunted both by the Alliance), Kailee the ships mechanic, Book, a preacher (who has a much hinted at past that he was a high member of the Alliance), and Inara, who is a licensed Companion (space age high class call girl).  This show gelled from the get-go.  They just mesh perfectly and it's a joy to watch if you like SCI-FI.  They most high tech thing about the time period is they have space travel, advanced medical technology, but for weapson, hand-held anyway, they are stuck with projectile weapons (bulllets). It has a high "old west" feel to it.  The intro song is pretty catchy too, and is actually written by Joss Whedon the creater of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".  On the 4th dvd they include his playing/singing of it to the studio to give them an idea of what he thought it should be like.  They left it intack, but spiced up the tempo.   The set is going for $39.99. If your a fan on the show, thats very reasonable, as you get the entire series on 1 set of DVDs.  Sounds like the sales of the set are doing very well, so if we get lucky, maybe the studio will bring the show back due to sales.  There is also rumor going around that Firefly is already making the transistion to the BIG screen already. If that's the case and is true, I can't wait to see Serenity flying across the screen.

      Migraines. It's amazing how they can control your life.  On the drop of a dime you could have to stop, take medicine, crawl into bed, and hope to get to sleep before it really starts hitting you.  My doctor is nice in the fact that he gives me the free migraine medication samples that they are given, so I don't have to pay for a prescription. I looked up some of the prices, and all I can say, is wow doc! Thank you!   For me, migraines are dehabilitating.  I get a running fever that varies from feeling like I'm freezing, or burning up, with drenching sweating.  Bright lights, and sounds make my head feel like it wants to explode.  I can easily tell anytime that I've gotten food poisioning from fast food, because after eatting, 20 minutes later my stomach starts to rumming, then the head starts to throb, then the sweating starts.  The best thing I can hope for then, is to have to throw up as it seems to really help out.   Once, I had a migraine in the afternoon, and as I laid down, I was   ok. Then I had a cool breeze blow throw the window above our bed, and I had to throw up.  Never had that happen before.  I'm really thinking about taking the docs offer of giving me a referral to a neurologist, to see if we can came up with a reason as to why I get migraines. It varies..sometimes I won't have one for 3-4 weeks, and then I'll have two reasonably close together.  I can do w/o the pain.  You learn to identify what signs your experiencing to tell you have a migraine coming on.  For me, usually, it starts as a throbbing in my right temple, sometimes left. It gradually gets really bad, where I feel that either a blood vessel is going to blow up, or it's trying to pull itself free from my body.  Either way, it's excrucitatingly painful.  If I haven't head migraine medication by then, it wont happen period.   I get the aura's on occassion too, and suffer from the "after-period" that can range from 1 day, to 3 or 4.  I would REALLY enjoy not getting these things.  I have no known trigger, except bright lights  . Thats the only one I can think of.  It's been suggested that long sessions of driving cause them. I make trips back to where I grew up, ever couple weeks, usually to work on pc's for friends, or just visit family. Z*lda thinks it's the long drive that does it.  It's 1:20 1way.  When I helped drive on our summer vacation in '99, in my parents 27ft long travel trailer, I didn't have a problem at all, and I was driving for 3-4hrs straight.   At one point I had a gray tint to my glasses to help with headlights at night, as they can be really really killer.  I've not had the that for a few years, but I did get antiglare coating on them, and that seems to help alot as well.     Well, enough of this for the night, time to go tend to my post-migraine, and hope it stays just a post and does become "a" again.

      Well, we were going to go to the 11:45am showing of Return of the King (#1 son and myself).  Well, off to a semi-slow start to the morning, we went to the 2:45 showing instead.  We took christmas candy in a ziplock baggy, got our 2 matinee tickets, and then spent $9.50 on pop and popcorn.  The theatre was surprisingly empty.  It got to maybe half-full if that by the time the movie started.  We sat through the previews for Spider-Man 2, and Harry Potter 3 (both look like they are going to be really good).  #1 son had to get up and use the bathroom 1x during the movie. I was able to make it the whole way through w/o an interruption.  Just as a side note, it started to snow as we left. We had a quarter inch of snow when we left. When we got outside and back to the car, we had 2inches or so.  The roads were slick, but not too bad a driving experience.    The movie.  What can I say?  I did like it but did get bored several times.  There were a few things that again, were blatantly ADDED to the book.  Just like in The Two Towers when Frodo and Sam are taken by Faramir to Osgilliath, the oliphants in ROTK just didn't exist. It was dissapointing, but still an interesting scene.  There were parts of the movie that were spot-on, and others, that were totally ass-backwards. Some reason, I thought Aragorn would of looked alot more kingly at the end ceremony, but he looked like Stridder cleaned up. In the book he LOOKS like the King who has come back.  I guess I cant be completely happy with what they did, who could if they have read the books.   But as a movie, if you never ever read the real thing, it'll be a great series.  Even if you've read the books, they are still an awesome series...their just not the same though..if you know what I mean.  If your a Steven King fan, you'll know what I mean lol  It'll be interesting to see how it goes if they can manage to get the rights to do The Hobbit.  Since they did LOTR, The Hobbit should be spectacular!

       In less then 12hrs, I'm going to take our oldest son, and we're going to go see Return of the King.  I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing this.  Peter Jackson has done an awesome job with the Lord of the Rings series.  Granted, they've taken GREAT leeway with the story, putting in stuff here, taking out stuff there, totally screwing with whats really in the book here and there, but who's complaining? :-)  I'm really looking forward to seeing Shelob on the big screen. Plus the army of the dead, that'll be interesting to see as well.  3:20 is going to be alonnnnnnnnnggggg time sitting in that seat.  Going to have to make that soda last awhile.  Will post my opinons of the movie soon!

      I'm eagerly awaiting spring now.  I got 3 frisbee golf disks for Christmas. That brings my total up to 4 now. I now have 3 long range drivers and 1 medium range driver.  I took my cubscouts out this fall to play, and really enjoyed it. I used to play heavily when I was a teen, and am eager to play again.  We have a course here in Dubuque thats not very old, and Waterloo/Cedar Falls, where we moved from 5yrs ago has 3 courses, with 1 added in the last year.  I'm really looking forward to nice weather and then hitting the "links" so to speak. Will be a great way to get some exercise in as well.  Also for Christmas I got X-Men2, and Pirates of the Carribiean(sp).  Both really good movies. I was surprised at how good POTC turned out to be. Johnny Depp was actually GOOD in it!  A most enjoyable movie. X2 was good, in that they seemed to really get NightCrawlers character down perfectly.  I couldn't of asked for a better Kurt then that.  Plus it's obvious that X-3 is going to deal with Phoneix and her dark hidden bad self waiting to emerge.    Happy New Year everyone!

      Was working on the computer Wednesday night, when the PC locked up on me. I rebooted, and just after I put in my password and hit enter, the hard drive made a nice loud ka-chunk noise and the system froze again. I hit reset, and boom, bye bye registry. I spent a few hrs working on it to try to get it going again. no luck.  Thursday night after class, I started reloading it, and had it pretty much done by the time I crawled off to bed around 12:40.  Was using the PC after work Friday, around 5:30..KA-CHUNK it goes again, and this time when I reboot, I get drive failure warnings.  Great....just dandy....and I hadn't made a ghost image of what I had done yet, as a backup.  So I started searching pricewatch.com for HD's. I thought something in the 120gig range would be nice. I found a Maxtor 120gig 7200 RPM hard drive, with 8megs of cache on it, for $87. I called up our local Staples, to see if they would still match the internet, plus shipping/sales tax. Nope, they stopped doing that.  So, I hop onto another PC and order it on-line, as I can limp along for the week on a 4gig drive that I had sitting around. The drive will ship monday and take 6-8 business days to get here.  I can't wait, as the hd I have in now is only a UDMA 2, not a 5 like the 40 was.  I want my speed back! But...I can wait, it'll be worth the wait.

      Well, most of the weekend went pretty well.  We went out to the River Walk by the Grand Harbor resort Saturday.  What a windy/chilly day to go for a stroll along the river!  And we saw 13 people who just had to be out of their minds!  We walked past the restort, and over the rail-road tracks, by the ShotTower.  We stood at the top of the north end of the sidewalk, and saw 13 people standing on the MIDDLE of the frozen Mississippi river ice fishing!     This is a ways down-stream from the lock and dam.  We've heard the river moaning/cracking before, but to see *13* people ice fishing ON it [shakes head] that just seems nuts. Especially since the temp has been getting into the 40's the last week. We had snow and rain Friday, and more rain today.  The forcast calls for temps in the 40's all week [spring is springing!! WOOHOO!!].  Well, after the walk along the river, we went to BestBuy. I want to get a copy of DVD X Copy before they are forced to take it off the shelf. It's a really easy to use program, to use with your DVD burner. You can then make a back-up copy of your DVD.  The court says it's illegal now, but why not? Why should you not be allowed to make a backup copy, so incase your original gets scratched beyond all recognition and wont read anymore, should you not be allowed to backup your DVD?  Pure stupidity on the courts side..  Then we went over to the mall, to look around in the book store   and then wonder around in the video store and the game store.  Then it was off to Bishops to do as much as we could stand to eat from their buffett  .   It was in Best Buy that my head started to throb. Bright sunlight from out side, and while I was looking at software, some guy is on a PC right behind me, with MP3's he wants to buy BLASTING behind my head.  We got home about 4:45-5pm, and the first thing I did was to crawl in bed.  Where I thankfully fell asleep. I did wake up about 8-8:30 feeling totally ready to puke, but didn't, and fell back asleep.  I got out of bed at 8am... so that put me in bed sleeping for roughly 15hrs.  Yup, thats a very productive time..  Considering I had 50 pages to read for class, and 40 excersises to do, plus a program....all for tomorrow night.  Well, I've got the first 2 sections of exercices done, still have 10 pages to read, and a program to write.  I have some after work, that I'll work on my program. I'll get the reading and problems done yet tonight.  Oh the joy of being a college student!

      I'm taking Intro to Programming, as part of my college course right now. I'm learning to write in Visual Basic.net and it's quite interesting. It has a user interface that is incredibly easy to use.  I have my first program due tonight, it's really basic and simple. It just asks for you to input your age and resting heart rate, and it returns what your training heart rate should be.  Very simple.     But I was having a mental block, trying to remember how to get my data from the user.  Then I was like, DUH, smacked my forehead, and then put it in.  For my first program, I've probably got 2-3hrs of playing around trying to remember how to get the input. After I remembered, it took 60 seconds if that, for me to have it working.  I'm so proud!  Can you say WOOHOO!  So I have my program all printed out, and on a diskette to turn in tonight, along with my 20 or so exercises that were assigned.  I'm quite happy that I have my homework 100% and ready to turn in.  It's a relief to just sit down for 5 minuets, and know, that you have nothing due right THIS instant, and can just relax.   Life is always about being busy busy busy busy busy.. It's about cramming as much into your waking hours as you can, before it's time for you to die.  You don't want to have accomplished nothing.  But....sometimes that nothing is just as important, so you can de-stress for a few minutes, before getting your nose ground against the grinders wheel.  Relax! Monday's almost done!

      We've got a neighbor thats 100% inconsiderate.  Yesterday while I was toying around with the snow blower and did our spot, and then the rest of the blow down to the korner.  A neighbor had her car burried, so I did the back end of her car, almost to the bumper. Figure she didn't have that much to shovel then, and I was drenched in sweat from the 30ft of street to the korner that I had done already.   So what does this neighbor do? She parks in front of OUR house, and leaves the area around her car untouched.  She backed up and left, and when she came back, parked in our clean spot.  Granted, streets are considered 1st come 1st serve for parking, even if you cleaned the spot out.  BUT, when a neighbor, w/o asking is nice enough to clean 80% of the area around your car, you think they could do the rest themselves.    So I went out and did most of what was left, before getting fed up with the situation. Yesterday, it was being nice and courteous, but today after they cant do their own space, she wants it done, it's $ time.   IIt's kinda fun to do, to be honest, but it's still hot work.  Z*lda and the lady up-stairs both left notes on her windshield complaining.  Thats my 2cents worth for the day.

      Finally got to use the snow blower today.  I tried it Thursday night, and discovered, that it was out of gas.  So today, while talking with my Dad, I asked what the ratio should be.  You have to add 2.5oz of 2cycle oil to 1gal of gas for this little monster.  Well, I went out, started up the car, cleared off the snow, went down to my local Big A   and paid $10 for a 2.5gal gas can, and 1 quart of oil.    I made it easy on myself and just put in 5oz of oil into the gas can while I was still in the store. Made sense, I was nice and warm and it easy with it on the counter.  I figured that would work out great anyway, as when I then went to the gas station and put in 2gal of gas, it mixed it up nicely for me.  Get home, fill that bad boy up, take it out front, and then, pull my brains out to get it to start. It didnt like being cold either.     Finally got it going, and then proceeded to do the snow around our old blue beater mobile. Took care of that really fast, and I was beginning to think I might like this.  So I went past our neighbors drive way, to where I had parked our nice car yesterday, and started to clean that out.  When I left, so did our neighbor upstairs, and I beat her back, so I put our car in the clean spot in front of the house.  Z*lda and the boys were leaving shortly for a swimming party anyway.  So I proceeded to just do a 30ft stretch behind a burried in car.  I even helped by clearning the street almost up to her bumper.  It was VERY hot work though. I even did some of the street, connecting to the neighbors driveway, as I figure if it was clean, it would make it easier for us to park in front of our house.   I then went and did the side walk where I got snow on it from the street. Then for the heck of it, I even did the little sidewalk that goes between the two houses to the south of us.  I figure, it's helping out w/o being asked, and lots of neighbor kids cut through on that sidewalk on their way home from school.     Just like the BoyScout motto says "Do a good turn daily".

      Ok, so it's only the Friday after this happened   but oh well. lol.  I have to admit, that I tuned in and watched the 1st half of the Super Bowl.  The commercials are what really draw me in. Plus the idea of what should be a really kickin half-time show.   Well.. for some reason the phrase "purple horse shoes, green clovers, silver sun nipple rings" popps into my head.    I'm already being told that my finding what Jan*t Jacks*n and Justln Tim*rlake did as inappropriate, was the wrong way to feel.  But, JJ and JT took the right of parents away from all around the world, who were watching the show, that just MIGHT not have wanted their children to see that.    I wouldn't have an issue with it if it would of been on Pay-Per-View, or regular cable type channel.  By doing it that way, they would of been required to put a TV Rating code on it.  It was inappropriate, pure and simple, just as thats simply my opinion of it.  Right or wrong, my view is that it's wrong.  Plus the dancers sort of  , whom if you paid attenion, were wearing mini-skirts, garters, stockings, small types, that kind of stuff, if you were in the stadium in person, it might of made you not notice how JJ and JT were quite touchy/feely in a very intimate way if you get the drift.  Oh well.... My take is, that best part of it was the Budwiser commercial with the romantic date in the horse drawn carrage.  Ah, serious drama!

            Make your own map  here .   I had to snag this neat little idea from Joy over at  Witches Moon .  I put down states that I have physically been in, I didn't include states that I've flown over.  Missing from the map though, I see I forgot Mississippi and Arkansaw (or is that Alabama?)  lol   We used to do alot of traveling when I was growing up, during our summer vacation.  Have drove to Florida twice, went to South Dakota, with a brief foray into Wyoming to visit the Tetons and Devils Tower (no mashed potatoe jokes please).    The only reason I've been to the west coast, was when I went as part of the National Guard. The one time I went to Camp Hunter Ligget(sp), we flew into VanDenberg AFB, and bused to the base.   The other time we flew from Waterloo, Iowa, to Las Vegas (didnt get to have any fun) and then were hauled in charter buses for 4hrs out into the Mohave Desert to NTC, also known as the National Training Center.  That was a fun time! Really! It was!  Very kewl way to see the desert.  Well, I'm off to shovel snow, it looks like we're finally going to get some snow! woohoo!! so naturally what happens? My snowblower is out of gas (how ironic!)  Time to shovel!  And always remember, play it safe and be careful!

      Well, Mr Migraine paid me a visit again yesterday.  We had a wonderful time, we all went out to the Swiss Valley Park Nature center area for a hike.  It was a  VERY  windy day, so on occasion, the 52deg weather felt  REALLY  cold.  We probably walked a mile or two, on very squishy ground. Was a very beautiful day and we had an excellent time.  Afterwards, we made our way over to Culvers. That was a good experience even.  Then we came home.  Then that tell-tale sign of the right temple started to throb.  I got up and took 1000mg of tylenol, hoping it might help some. Well, wonder of wonders, it didn't.  So, at 7:20 I climbed in bed. But...being me, an Episode of  STAR TREK: Enterprise  on that I hadn't seen, so I stupidly continued to watch it.  I made it to the end, and happy that it turned out to be a really decent and thought provoking episode.   Then I tried to get to sleep, and that was fit-full. Z*lda was working on quilt-squares or something, as I was laying in bed.  She stopped, and grabbed the ice-pack that I had handy, and I put that on my temple to try to help (think it did help some).  Then, I had that rumbling in the tummy that told me I'd best move toward the bathroom.  Huh, what do you know, my tummy was right for a change.   After the massive bought of vomiting I had, I went back to bed, and felt better for about 10 minutes. Then the hot/cold flashes started. I think I fell asleep toward the start of them for a change, and went into dreamy non-migraine pained bliss.  Think it's time to check in with the doc to see if he has any migraine meds in-stock yet, or if I should just break down and have him give me a prescription.    If I get a prescription, I think I'll see if I can get the inhaler and pill form of Imitrex.  I've found that my best luck is to take a tablet when I can start to feel the signs of a migraine, and then an hr later use the inhaler. That seems to give me the best protection.  I've had that fight off a migraine on a few occasions that way.  The doctor has the injector version, but I just cant get into the idea of giving myself a shot (shudders). I hate needles as it is, and just cant get past the idea of using one myself.  I know...I'm a wimp.  I'll stick with the pill and inhaler form of it.  So I put in another Saturday night in bed with a migraine. Got up about 8:40, so only about 13:30 hrs in bed again.  Migraines, what a wonderfully relaxing way to spend your evening.

      Well, we had our Pinewood Derby for our CubScout Pack Thursday night.  We had a fantastic evening!  We had our weigh-in, and measuring (car has to fit inside a  box  thats 7inches long, and no wider the the car with it's wheels on).  We got all our cars checked in by the 6pm dead-line. We handed out the participation patches to all the kids as they were certified, just to make it easier.  I arrived at 5pm, to start unloading the track from the car, and getting stuff carried in.  The track is extreamly easy to setup. We purchased a 35ft 2 lane aluiminum track from  http://www.besttrack.com .  All I had to do was to put the pieces of track together, pushing in the ends of the metal dowell pins into the other piece of track, and clip it together with some binder clips.  We had the track together, with our electronic time keeper hooked up, was maybe 20 minutes.  I gave it a quick wipe down, and then we were ready!  We started out with our Flag Ceremony, and some opening announcements.  I got to hang our 2004 National Quality Unit Award streamer on our Pack Flag, and we handed out the patches to all the scouts to put on their uniforms.  We also handed out some patches for our Webelos Overnighter last fall (we ordered the new patches, which came out in 2004, and was our first chance to give them out).    I also had some achievements for my Webelos II Scouts as well. Then it was time to start the races!  While we were doing our awards, we also had our 2 judges looking at the cars, to pick a  Best Design  and  Most Unusual  from each den, and those cars would get trophy's.  We had 25 Scouts racing this year! Always a good turn out for Pinewood derby!  We had no issues, no squables, bickering, or arguing! It was awesome. No cars malfunctioned.  It was probably the best Pinewood Derby we've had while I've been a leader.  The cars were great, there were some excellent races (Including * 2 * re-races, as we had to have the cars flip sides and go again, because they tied!).   All-in-all, it was just an awesome evening.  Z*lda made up 2 kerchiefs for the winners, out of a checkered flag material. These went to our 1st and 2nd place winners, and they get to wear those kerchiefs to districts where they represent our pack, and to our last 2 pack meetings.  Our oldest who is a Webelos II won a trophy for Best Design for his den.  Both boys want to take their cars to district to show, to have a chance for a trophy there.  Our youngest got one last year for Most Unusual Design.      All I can say, is that I really get into doing the Pinewood Derby races, and it just gets funner and funner every year.  I'm going to help out the local Boys and Girls Club's Pack a hand, and take our track down Tuesday to help out with their races as well.   Might be helping out another pack as well, they have to contact me yet.    Cant tell I had a great time can you?  It's a very energetic evening, and it tends to last for a little while :-) Can't wait for next year, to do it again! :-)

      Well, I must say, that the world looks really different for the moment.  I had an eye exam after work, and my pupils are still extremely dilated, so everything is a little fuzzy/blurry.  Plus, I'm not wearing my glasses, and from what the eye doctor said, I don't need them.    Talk about a shock!   I've worn glasses for the last oh.....28yrs? and suddenly I don't have to wear them? Wow! I need to get some sunglasses! :-)  It sounds like after a few weeks, my eyes will have adjusted and I won't have any of the weirdness of looking at the world w/o glasses any more.  I'm no longer visually impaired! WOOHOO!

      Got both boys Pinewood Derby cars done today. We got the decals all on, got the clear coat of varnish on, wheels and axles mounted, and weights put on. Cars weigh in @ 5.0 oz's, just what we want to have them at.   now all we have to do is wait until it's Thursday, then it'll be time to try them out and see how they do!     We have a half-hr weigh in period to get all our Scouts through. They have to put their car in a wood "box", to make sure it's not over 7inches long, and no wider then 1 lane, so it doesn't interfere with the other car in it's own lane.  Then we'll put the car on our new digital scale, to make sure it weighs no more then 5.0 ounces.  Then the car can get it's official race day number, and then be put on the table, until it's time for that scout to race.  We'll start off with all our awards to give out, and we have alot to give a way.  After about 10-15 minutes we should be done, and then it'll be time to start racing!  We have about 24 scouts, and we'll be doing a double elimination.  Last year our oldest son went undefeated and took 1st place for his first time.  He went to district but didn't end up winning. Great experience though!  Also, tomorrow, I start my 2nd class, which will be Philosophy and the family. So that'll be 2hrs more of classes on Monday/Thursdays..those days are going to be long ones, I can see that already.  Still, I'm pumped, I love Pinewood derby, it's our funnest meeting of the whole year in my opinion.  Will post how the boys do! Wish them luck!

      and it feels like I'm still recovering from being sick over the weekend.  Our oldest was sick last Thursday, and the rest of us came down with it during the night late Friday night.  I was supposed to go help assist with some training at the local district Scout Camp for OWL (Outdoor Webelos Leader) and Baloo (Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation). Well, that didn't happen. I felt bad as there was no way for me to contact them to let them know, since the leader I was going help was there Friday evening already.  I woke up about 4am, and already didn't start feeling very well. I realized later, that I had already started feeling bad the evening before when we went out to eat, and I was starting to feel extremely tired.  Well, I had my clock set to go off at 7:15, which would have given me time to get my clothes together, cleaned up, and on the road. I had already packed my tent, sleeping back, a chair, and a few other things in the trunk of the car the night before.  By 7:30, I had started to throw up.  Oh that’s such a joyful experience. I won’t go into details about what else was happening, but needless to say I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.  That continued during the whole day.  I napped for about a half-hr or so, and just couldn't seem to quite get any actual rest. So about 4, laying on the couch, hips starting to ache like I had a case of the flu, I had the boys throw "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" in the DVD player. We have it on loan from my parents.  It's an interesting movie. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but it was a fun watch.  Some of the plot lines are more then paper thin, and I was able to anticipate what was going to happen, quite easily before it did.  The boys seemed to enjoy it though, and they seemed to like the special effects. Personally, I while I thought the Sub of Capt. Nemo's was very impressive; it was completely wrong/inaccurate to what is described in the classic "20,000 leagues under the Sea".  Plus, I never realized that Capt. Nemo was from India. Go figure.  By this time, I had started to sip on some Kool-Aid, as I was dehydrating very fast.  I also had some chicken noodle soup, sans noodles. That was all I had to eat.  Sunday I felt better for the most part, some more energy, hips still aching though.  I had some actual food type food that day.  I've been slowly getting myself to eating more daily, but it's still taking some time to get my appetite back.    I've spent some of our tax return myself finally, and can't wait for the items to get here.  I ordered the 19 inch monitor that I've been wanting for ages. It should arrive in a day or two.  That will make it easier on Z*lda, since the 17 is hard to see text on for her.  It shouldn't be much different in size than our 17 inch monitor now, as it's a Nokia from 2000, so it's on the big side.  That will go down to our youngest son so he'll have something better then a 15 to work on.    I've also made it official and have become a card carrying member of the Star Trek Fan club! This is the part that cool to me. I've wanted to join the fan club for years, and finally have.  It's $30 to join, and for joining up, if you pay the $6.50 shipping, you get a $20 lithograph for free (is anything truly free?).  So I ordered another lithograph to go with it, that shows the Enterprise NX-01 in space next to a planet.  Just wondering where I can put that up, w/o being too obnoxious about Trek :-)  I almost got the Captain Proton one, which is from Star Trek: Voyager. It's based on a "serial" type story line in the holodeck that Lt. Paris and Ensign Kim use. Think of the old Tom Swift/Flash Gordon matinee's from the 30's/40's and you'll have it.    School is getting close to being done, and I can't wait.  Taking two classes, while being so active in scouts, and work, and trying to have a life just runs you down.  I have some research to do, as I'm going to be writing a paper on the topic, that if it should be required to have a license to have children or not.  I thought it would be an interesting topic, as I can easily and readily see how the argument could go both ways.  You have to have a license to drive a car, so why not to have kids? Seems to make sense.

      Have gone to the course 4 times in the last week, and am loving it.  We haven't played a complete 18 hole session yet. We've done 15 holes. It's a very challenging course to walk, due to all the steep inclines, but it's a fun work out.  We've thinking of going again today, due to the nice weather, and having the day off for Good Friday.    While playing Wednesday, I almost lost my Innova "StingRay".  Was the 7th hole, and I had what I thought was an excellent throw.  I thought I saw where it landed, and then the boys threw their discs.  We moved down the fareway, and I started going to where I thought my disc had landed.  Whoops! Where'd it go!  We spent probably 20-25 minutes looking around for it. Then, for the first time, I decided to just play on and call it a loss.  We played the 8th, and then the 9th/10th play back along the way we came.  So I kept my eyes peeled and looking, just in-case.  Woohoo!! There it is, it had landed, and at an odd angle to spot from up where we had been.  So I've yet to lose a disc, but came very close.  I had just got done telling the oldest son, that it would be a beautiful day Thursday, and with a nice afternoon sunshine coming down, that it would be real obvious to anyone to find.  Luckly we found it first.  Can't wait, it's 52, should be a great day at the course! :-)  Will post some pics of our trip, so show what the course looks like.

      Was my last post really on the 21st? I'm behind. Course, it seems like I've been very busy lately, what with work, school, and scouts.   Plus, Sunday was my Birthday! I turned 36.   We had our CubScouts out camping this weekend. It was a huge success I feel. Course, it could of been warmer over-night (no issues, the kids had bedding, and a double-barrel wood stove to keep them warm), and I will next time make sure to NOT plan the camp-out on the weekend of Day Lights Savings time. The oldest son had to get up at 6:45 adjusted time Sunday morning.  One thing led to another, and 98% of the scouters decided to get up at that time too.  I decided to "lay-in" and got up at 7:15, with the last 3 other people.  It was still too early, as in my opinion, it was only 6:15.  Made for a long tiring morning. We got the boys all fed, got the cabin cleaned up, so it was nicer looking then when we arrived. We got the outsides picked up, took 2 pics of the all the scouts who attended, and then headed out the gate.  At least this year I didn't have a cow act like it wanted to slam it's front hooves on my hood.  In the afternoon, we went down (just our family) to the new Dubuque County Jail, for a public tour. It's taken, like forever, to get this jail finished, but I must say, it is pretty impressive.  It's only the 2nd jail I've ever had a tour off, and it was #1  lol  Very interesting designs.  I was really surprised to notice, that there were cameras  EVERYWHERE , but in the stair wells. That seems like an obvious place, since it takes a key to operate an elevator.  It's actually 71degrees here!  Can't wait, means every day will soon be like this, and it'll be time to hit the frisbee golf course over by Veterans Memorial Park off Kane St.  It's a really awesome course, but it  WILL  give you a work-out, as just like everywhere else in Dubuque, it's full of hills.

      Went to the Doctor today with the oldest so we could get a physical, to attend Boy Scout camp this summer.  While there I had the Doc look at a spot on the back of my lower left calf. It was decided, to make an appointment for next week to have it removed, based on his impression, it looks like it's skin cancer.  We'll know for sure after they check it out. It's a small spot about a quarter inch round, that on occassion hurts into the muscle. There is also another spot about 4 inches above it thats probably in my opinion going to be the same way.  Plus there are 2 other spots just like that one on the back of my left shoulder.  Hopefully I wont turn into a walking tumor.  Time will tell, I get to have it removed on the 2nd of June.  Then 2 days later I will be camping with our Boy Scout Troop over-night, to help setup for a fund-raiser the next day.  Too much to do, too little time to do it in..

      Well, we went out and tried our hand at the Disc Golf League.  Oldest son and I went.  I played in the "B" group, Oldest son went with Disc Golf Dude© and was on in the "A" group.  I was naturally the worst of the group of 4 I was in, but I did have a few decent shots.  We started playing shortly after 5:30, and it took about 2hrs to play all 18 holes.   It was different, as we were playing from "alternate" tee's, which I think helped really throw me off my game.  It made all the wholes 20-50ft shorter.  My best shot of the night came at the very end, when we had a CTP (closest to the Pin) throw.  We went outside the entrance of the park, and stood by the parks sign, and threw 2 discs at the practice basket. The closest to the basket got a free "mini".  I was about the 3rd or 4th from last to throw (about 18 of us).  I threw my Super Roc tie-dye, and I about fell over stunned, as from the 300ft shot, I landed it about 6ft from the basket.  WOOHOO!! So I got a few mini-marker, so when I throw, I can drop my mini to mark my spot, and pick my disk up to throw.  Oldest son got a free disk as well, for playing as the younest player. He got a free FireBird, a disc I've been wanting to pick up for a specialty throw.  I was trying to talk him into giving it to me, but he wanted it as it's an Ultra-Long Range drive.     He just offered to give it to me, but I told him to keep it, as he wants a ULD©. He'll have to work to throw it as far as ULD© should be, but as he's so young, he's not throwing his Mid-Range driver as far as he should.  We'll keep practicing, and we'll get to the point where we can throw these chunks of plastic as far as we should, with control. It'll just take some time, but we'll get there   :-)

      Well, school is over for the semester finally. WOOHOO!!  I had 2 classes this term, (a B- and a B) which I've decided is almost too much to do at the same time as working a full-time job, being active in CubScouts as a Pack Leader/Den   Leader, and trying to help people with their home PC's. I've got to find out how to get my grades yet, as I'm eager to see what I ended up with. Plus, I'd like to get submitted for tuition reimbursement (money NEVER hurts).   It'll be nice to have my Monday/Thursday evenings open for the next couple of months for a change. The boys and I have really gotten into playing Disc Golf©. We have a really awesome course here, just a hard one for beginners due to the EXTREAMLY number of trees lining the course. It's a very beautiful course, located by Veteran's Memorial Park on the west side of the park.  The oldest son and I went down Sunday at 1, as they had mentioned on the local Cable access channel that they would be having 2hrs of lessons, for $5/person with a disc included.  We were there, and the only other person to show up was the instructor.  They mentioned about pre-registering but I hadn't seen anything on the TV about that. They said we didn't have to pay but I still did, just to cover their time.  The guy who was teaching us REALLY knows his stuff, and is going to be playing at the World's in Des Moines, Iowa this August.  He's an Amateur in the PDGA, and said next year he'll probably go Pro.  That guy can really heave a disc.  On the 10th hole, which is 400ft, he JUST missed the basket, and that was with just 1 throw. He was able to tell after seeing me throw 2x, that I used to play tons of Frisbee when I was a kid/teen.  I have to remember to follow through with my throw, and also have my arm higher up when I throw, as I hold it too low.    He was saying that I should also use a power grip when I throw from the tee too, as the more power I throw it with, the more the disc will spin, and the further it will go.  After seeing the way this dude threw, I want to throw like that too.  He also showed me a handy throw, where I throw the disc side armed, and instead of pulling my arm all the way back like I'm going to throw a baseball, I just take it about half-way back, and snap my elbow forward, and give my hand a flick, and it will send the disc out straight, and then cause it to curve to the right. This kind of throw will be extremely handy on the 8th hole, where they turned it into a dog-leg.  Only thing is I need a new disc for it, as the only one I have that’s good for that throw I let my youngest son have.   We've just gotten into the sport really, this spring, and we already have 11 discs between us.  Course, this is nothing, as our instructor Sunday says he has about 200.  This guy knew all the stats on the discs that we had even, being able to tell us which ones were the better ones, their speed and turning ratios, everything. He was very impressive and I hope he does really well at the Worlds.   It goes on for 5 days, and there are 5 courses in  Des Moines with each player playing 1 course a day.    It was also very hot Sunday while we played.  It was 83° and humid, so when we got back to the car after playing 18 holes, I was soaked.  I got the boy and I some PowerAid to carry on the course, and we had that gone by the time were on the 15th.  We got back to the car, we had some water bottles that we had with ice in them, and they   were totally melted due to how hot the car got.  All I cared about was the fact that it felt ubber-cool as I poured half of it over my head.  Boy did that feel good!  After watching the Disc Golf© Dude throwing like he did, it makes me want to practice that much more so I can be a 10th of how good he is.

      Well, the good news is, that the 2 pieces of me that were carved out by my Doctor last week as possible skin cancer came back negative.  Neither one was at that stage.  The way I'm thinking, is it's good it's gone, so it doesn't have a chance to go that way.     The other good, is that the stiches are out.  My back is fine, Doc says that it's healing nicely.  The leg..well...thats a different story.  The stiches hurt alot more when they removed them from my leg then my back.  I asked Doc about how the skin was really pulled tight and causing the skin at the edge to bunch up in a line. He said they called those Dog Ears.  Woof woof I guess.  So, he said just take it easy, I'm pretty much good to go, and sent me out the door. My appointment was at 4:15, I was leaving the parking ramp at 4:24.  The body parts smarted a hair, from having the stiches pulled out.  It's pouring practically by the time I'm ready to step out of the car at home.  I open the door, put out my left leg (can you see this coming yet?) and I must of twisted my leg just enough as I stood up out of the car, that my leg popped open. Oh, talk about stinging.   I came into the house, went right into the kitchen, grabbing a phone book so I could call the doc back.  I'm sitting at the kitchen table, dabbing the back of my calf with a paper towel, to see that yup, it did pop.  I have a live person from Doc's office at 4:41. They said how soon can I be there, I said 9 minutes, they said come back in.  Doc comes in, cleans the leg up, said Yup! it's popped. I'm thinking SOB, I have to get one of those railroad spikes jammed into my leg again to numb it out.   He said Nope! Just pack it with antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a band-aid.  So, it gets to heal from the inside out.  Hope it's done in time for BS Camp, really looking forward to that.  I ran to Wal-Mart to cash a check at the bank, and decided to look at their multi-purpose tools, as I've been w/o one for awhile now (if you know a techie geek and they don't have their multi-purpose tool, you know their mentally lost).  I picked up a nice little Gerber for $32w/tax.   My leatherman's small tip screw driver BROKE, which really pissed me off to be honest.  I decided since a new Leatherman would run me $29.99, and it was IDENTICAL to the one I have, which happens to be about 7yrs old, that I wanted to look at the Gerber Multi-Pliers 400.  Thats the one I ended up getting, I liked the pliers design, and the locks on the accessories that flip out, so they wont close on you while pushing with all your might (you know what I mean, and man is that a blood blister!).     Will see how good the Gerber does. I had a Winchester MultiPurpose too that I got last fall for $15, and it wasn't worth it.  Was $15 wasted. Looked nice, functioned not so nice..

      Well, the Oldest Son© and I went to the 7PM showing of the new Harry Potter movie. We are both huge fans of the series and the movies.  The books are really something else, and the 1st two movies are excellent.  I wish I could say the same for the 3rd movies adaption of the book.  I was dissapointed to the EXTREME to say the least.  They left an incredible amount of information out that is vital to the story, changed various things around location wise, made changes to BIG things in the story like, having so-n-so say them instead of who should have.  They added stuff into the story that wasn't there in the first place, and didn't put in stuff that in my opinion is crucial to the plot and over-all story.  I'm amazed that J.K. Rolling let them do this to the story and I hope to Gaea that she doesn't let them do the same thing to "The Goblet of Fire".  Some of the filming styles were quite well, I'll admit that some of the scenes were nice with the way they were filmed, some of the HUGE changes to the grounds of Hogwarts was unacceptable.  I won't say anything for awhile, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.    I just came out feeling very let down, like an old-friend had just cheated me.  Such is life I guess...

      We had a fun raiser that we did last night for the Boy Scout troop that Oldest Son© and I attended. We started out with a hike over to Wendy's for a quick supper, then it was a hike back to the track, for a tour of the track it self.  It was actually quite interesting.    We then went back to the camp area, and got organized. Then some of the boys wanted to go back and sit out in the bleachers (free pop!) and see what it was like to watch the dogs go zipping by.  After sitting for 2 races, we decided to head back out to our camp site, setup some tents, and then the boys procedded to play Capture the Flag with glow sticks.  I think that was Oldest Son's© favorite part of the camp out.  He got to help setup a Eureka Timerline two man tent and spent the night in it, so he got one of his requirements met.   They did a fund raiser in association with the Walleye Club, and Oldest Son© earned some $ for his individual account for Scouts, to use towards Scouting equipment/camp.  We got up about 5:45am, and started getting into gear.  Things went very smooth, and I was able to leave at 7:30 to get to the house and clean up to get ready to help out at a Cub Scout Day Camp at a local school.  That ran from 8:30 until 3pm. Was a great time!  They had some people dressed up in 1200-1500BC type clothing to reflect King Arthur.  Was a perfect day(little warm tho) for the Day Camp. The kids got a really cool bag, some treats in it to have during the day, a really nice T-Shirt, and an awesome looking patch to wear on their uniform.  It's been a loooooooooong day, and we might still go see Harry Potter 3 tonight, otherwise it's tomorrow to see it.

      Well, the doctors appointment went pretty well.  I had them look at the two spots on my left shoulder, and they decided those are ok right now, but he then went on to look at 3-4 different spots on my back, and decided 1 had to come off today.  So I have 2 stiches in the middle right side of my back, 3-4 inches over from my spinal column.  The other is from the lower part of my left calf.  That one took 3 stiches.  I get to go back a week from tomorrow to have them taken out.     You would think, since novocaine would hurt so much going in.  The stick of the needle sucked, but to have that liquid fire going into your leg...OUCH!!!  I got to look at the spots the doc took out, and was surprised at how big they seemed.  The one on the leg was 8mm and they used a "punch" to take it out.  I should know by next week when I have the stiches taken out if they are actually skin cancer or not. Based on how they looked (EW!!) I'd say the qualify.  Hopefully they don't though.   I took 1500mg of Tylenol (generic) to make sure I was ready for when the pain starts to kick-in.  Hopefully it wont be too bad, but judging by how deep he went, I'm "definetly going to feel that in the morning"

      I was home from work about 30 minutes late, to make up for doing to the doc during the afternoon.&nbsp; When I got home, the family was gone. They were about 10 minutes behind me..&nbsp;  &nbsp; Z*lda said she was going to go to a garage sale out by John Deere Road. I was like, ok, sure, go ahead.&nbsp; She comes back awhile later, and as I come into the living room says "I picked this up, is it worth anything?"&nbsp; Just from the shape of the package I knew it was a Palm Pilot, but not what kind. It could of been anything really old as an original Palm One or 1000, or something newer. &nbsp; Boy was I in for a surprise! I take it out of the bubble wrap, and it's a Palm M515! in perfect/brand new condition!!!!&nbsp; I was like OMFG!!! What did you pay for this!&nbsp; She then said he had $35 on it, but she only had $26 on her, so he sold it to her for that, plus the 3-4 other things she had in her arms!!! &nbsp; I checked it out on Pricewatch, and it still sells for $241 shipped! OMFG! This is just incredible!! &nbsp; And it works! Beautifully too!&nbsp; It's got 16 megs of memory, and runs 33mhz, and is color!&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in a PDA, thats awesome!&nbsp; Plus I can buy one of those new style memory cards to put into it and increase it's ram. I've got tons of software installed on it, and files put onto it already (with other stuff left to transfer yet), and it STILL has 10megs of space left (has 4 megs of memory thats used I'm assuming by the Palm OS 4.01. &nbsp; This is so frellin kewl!! &nbsp; Now the youngest is eager as I said if I ever got a new PDA he could have my HandSpring Visor Deluxe. Now he cant wait to get it! :-)

      Wow! What can I say? We went and see Spider Man 2 at the theatre last night, and it's just awesome.  The special effects for Spidey this time are incredible and very fluid. I couldn't spot any obvious jumps between live action and CGI.  The story was awesome, got a bit boring at times, and didn't screw with the ideas set with the comic book as badly as the 1st one did.  They have all the cast from the 1st movie back, with a short appearance of William DeFoe at the end.   The actor they picked to play Dr. Otto Octavious is perfect. The guy couldn't of been any better a choice if they tried, he was out and out perfect for the roll.    I must say that I'm very impressed with it, dont want to go into details and ruin it for anyone reading (there are people reading this site still I hope?). All I can say is that when this bad boy comes out on DVD, there will be a place on our shelf waiting for it.  On a side note, picked up a fun old movie that just came out on DVD last month. Wizards.  Who remembers that one?  Different type movie, but it's fun as well. Was interesting seeing Avatar the hero in action again. It's a movie that tells the tale of good vs evil (go figure) but this time, good is 3000+yrs old, is kinda horney, and gets the girl in the end (not literally, who knows might happen off screen tho).

      The oldest son and I got back from spending a week out at Boy Scout camp. We left on June 27th, and got home around 10:45am on July 3rd.  Boy was I tired!  We left the 27th at 11:45, and after picking up a few items we needed, we headed out to Camp C.S Klaus, located just outside of Coalsburg, Ia.      We arrived at camp, for our check-in time at 1:45. The Scouts all took their back-packs out of our Troops trailer, and we then proceeded to hike the 3 quarters of a mile to our campsite.  We were staying in Owl Hoot.  Got camp setup and everything organized. That evening we had our Council Camp Fire with all 7 troops present and the Camp Staff as well.  We got about 3/4's of the way through, before the sprinkles we'd had off/on all afternoon, turned into a steady rain. We stopped the fire, and then started heading back to our camp-site.  By the time we got there the rain was coming down heavily, and we were soaked from the knees down (we had poncho's on).   On Monday the boys started working on their merit badge courses, and our 4 1st year scouts started on their "Adventure Trail", where they were working on 3 different merit badges (Swimming, Basketry, and Indian Lore).   On Sunday all the scouts who wanted to use the water, had to get pass their swim test. There are 3 levels, White, Red, and Blue (being the highest and needed to work on the Swimming Merit Badge).  My son just got his white on Sunday, and then Monday took the test and passed for the Red Swimmer.  Tuesday he took his Blue and passed. That took swimming 4 25m laps, with the last lap a backstroke of some sort, and then a 5-10 second float on his back.  He had a cheering section going by the time he finished.  It's a big accomplishment when your 11, and you take a swim test that has you swim the length of a foot ball field. Way to go!!  We had some activities that night, on a troop level, that started off with a tug-of-war.  It  was quite hilarious actually. When we walked up, 2 groups were already going, and the 1st boy in the water (they dug a pit and filled it with water, making it a very muddy mess), did a dive, just like you'd see on Most Extreme Challenge off Spike TV. If we had had a camcorder, we could of won money on those home video shows, it was that funny.  By the time it was done, the same boy had ended up in the water 3 times.  They had a few other actives, like a team getting their members over a rope 4ft off the  ground, w/o touching the rope.  I was busy with the camera trying to get some decent pics of it as it was going on.  There was some other actives involving boards and ropes and carrying team-members around.  When we were done, we then made the almost 1mile hike back to our site.  The oldest son also had his first attempt at shooting a 22cal rifle and had a blast literally.  I'll have to take him out so he can practice for next summer as he now wants to take the Rifle Merit badge (along with Archery).  Wednesday was a bit of a challenge for him, as I think the long days were starting to get to him. The 1st years had to go on a 3 mile hike (1.5miles one way). He got back and was almost wiped from that, then had to go down and work as a server at our table.  I helped the 1st years with their waiter duties, as there was nobody there to tell them all what they had to do.  Then the 1st years headed down to the parade grounds for an evening of games and activities.  Oldest son decided he did NOT want to stay down there for the "sleep under the stars" camp out, and came back to the camp-site about 9:45.   Thursday was supposed to have the 1st years start out with a "Polar Bear" swim, which he didn't want to do either.  He was getting a little homesick by this point as he had cried some on Wednesday night before bed, and Thursday morning.  Thursday he had a better time of it, as he had another chance in Field sports to shoot the rifles and the Archery range again.   We then spent 2hrs down at Aquatics (the beach) for the Water Follies, a bunch of fun events that involved water.  One of the best practical jokes of the week went on at this event, and I'm sure will go down in the annals of Klaus folk lore.  I won’t describe it here, in an attempt to protect the not-so-innocent lol  We also had family night that night, so about 5pm families started to show up, and the scouts could take them around camp to show it off and some of the activities they had done.  Since it was Family Night, I got to walk around with my Son, just the two of us.  We went over to the Water Falls, which were just perfectly lit, and looked awesome.  We went over and watched the demo from the fire truck, and had something to eat.  Then it was time to head up for the Council Fire, which was pretty neat. It got just AWESOME when they started the tap out ceremony for the Order of the Arrow.  I won't even try to describe how incredible it was, just imagine a Pow-Wow drum going, torches, and people dancing and throwing said fire torches.  It had to be the kewlest ceremony I've seen in Scouting yet. After that was done, we headed back to our camp-site to put an end to our night.  The only mishap of the week happened about 3:36am that night, when my son decided to roll a little too far to his right on his bunk, and rolled out of the tent.  The tents, are Boy Scout type tents, which are on raised wooden platforms, 2 poles holding the center up, with a beam between them.  My son’s side of the tent was about 2ft off the ground, and his bunk added another foot and a half to that. I heard him fall, and jumped out of bed, and with flash-light in hand, leaned over his bunk and looked out the side of the tent. Sure enough, there he was on the ground in his sleeping back, sitting up wondering what had just happened. He only really remembers the “whoosh” of the air going by him as he fell.  I told him to climb back up into the tent, and he looked like an inch-worm in his sleeping bag as he did it.  He fell asleep almost as fast as he had fallen out of bed.  It took me another 45 minutes to fall back asleep after that.  I did listen to the Owls hooting away though as I waited.  Friday the Scouts got to put finishing touches on any Merit Badges they hadn't finished yet. My son got his Indian Lore and Basketry badges finished up, and some of his Swimming done as well.  2 out of three ain't bad!  It was also a chance for me to perform the practical joke that I'd had planned for the week.  We had 3 boys who pulled a joke on a leader and shouldn't have gone into his tent. So....I enlisted some help, and I put their cots on the roof of the latrine. It worked out very nicely. Even have pictures of the not-so-innocent helping me do it.  All 3 Scouts took it extremely well, and we helped them pull their stuff down after it was done. By evening, we got ready for our last Council fire, were each troop had to put on a Skit and do a cheer.  Our Skit was so long we didn't do a cheer.  It was BY FAR the best skit of the evening. We did "The Wizard of Klaus", and it was hilarious.  I got to be the Wizard due to being able to do a deep voice that projected so the audience could hear.  We headed back to our camp site to finish up our packing (we pull all other stuff that we didn't want to haul-out on our hike out, back in the troop trailer), and then hit the sack. We got up at 6:10, so we could get ready, and have our Camp Site cleared out and signed off by 6:45am. We then hiked down the hill to the dinning hall for a quick cinnamon roll and milk, before going down to the parade grounds, were we threw our packs into the trailer, divvied up the Scouts between the cars, and then made our 40minute drive back to Dubuque.   We then proceeded to divvy our gear back up into our respective vehicles and headed home.  It was an incredible week, very tiring, but we had an awesome time.   The leaders who stayed all week, at the last Council fire, were even presented with a Mini-Multi tool that say "stayed all week leader, Camp C.S.Klaus" which I thought was nice.  But what was nicer?  Getting to spend the week there with my Son, having a great time, and getting to sleep again in my own bed.  We can't wait until next year! Is it 2005 yet?

      We had the opportunity to go to a political rally tonight, and we got to see John Kerry speak in person. I was impressed, even though I stood most of the time we were there. We got in line at 4:10, and the speakers started at 6:15. It was almost 7:45 before we saw Sen.. Kerry speak. I thought it was a good speech! It was an excellent chance to see THE future President of the USA in person.  In 1991 we got to see Al Gore talk at the Waterloo, IA airport, along with Sen.. Tom Harkin. Tonight we got to see Sen. Harkin again, introducing John Kerry. We also got to hear a few other local politicians, and we also  got to have 3 songs sung to the crowd by David Grohl from FooFighters, and one time drummer for Nirvana. I've heard the songs that he sang on the radio, with the full band, and they sounded way different, but enjoyable ( urlLink Z*lda  didn't like them).  We just got home about 30 minutes ago, so we were there almost 5 hours, but it didn't seem like that long. We had to wait in line about a half-hour, and then go through a metal detector system. This meant that as we went by we had 2 sets of keys on the table, 3 PDAs (mine and the boys), a digital camera, and a purse. It was a very interesting experience, but it was worthwhile!  There was a quick little  jab  that they mentioned that I did like too. They had a little quip, referring to the current President Bush, and his father... it was  "Like father like son, one term and he's done."  That stuck in my mind, really liked it for some reason :-)
