      what if i said that...i wanted to leave this earth for just one day, to experience what its like to not have to worry about anything? would you let me go? would you let me reach for the stars...let me achieve everything i ever wanted? do you care enough about me to see what im worth? or do you just sit in your self centred world and sulk? i have no idea what im trying to say here... except for maybe were not right for each other? maybe we shouldnt talk to eachother... maybe we need to distince ourselves until the world falls down on us...what if.....

      Well this is it, starting off yet again another online journal. I hope I actually stick to this one. I have come to a conclusion that I have a problem sticking to things and being organized, someone once said to me. Its not that I don't try, its just I have no time, because of these people badgering for me to get things done for them that I forget to do things that I should have done long before. But you know what... Lately I haven't seemed to care much about anything. Certainly not about people who are careless of there own things especially when they can see IM having a hard enough time dealing with everything else. But you know what its okay. Because I don't care. well im talking to my friend sarah on the phone. its great i havent talked to her in ages.....i know this guy who actually inspired me to get this account some of the things he said were really deep... things that scare me!!! actually the thing that scares me is that i can totally relate to him!! i underastand everything he is trying to say because he says it clearly!!! every thought he wants his audience to understand they do!!! i know i certainly did! his journal actually helped me realize that, theres someone else out there that understands what im going through and feels the same way!!! it actually makes me feel safer!! heres a quote that makes alot of sence to me "If I wrote the truth down, could any of you handle it? I would probably hurt alot of you, probably shock alot of you, probably push alot of you away, even if I only had nice things to say about how much I love some of you, how much I miss some of you, how much I'd give up to be with you constantly, how far would I bend backwards for you." it makes me happy that this person is my friend and i can go to him when i need him because he will be there because he is my friend!!! when he needs me ill be there for him!!! together well battle everything that comes our way because 2 is better then one!!! anad thats all i need to know when im feeling depressed!!! whcih makes me a whole lot happyier!!!  well now that i have that off of my chest!!! i feel alot better im glad that i wrote!! luv marla
