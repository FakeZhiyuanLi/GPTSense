       wow i havent written in a long time....havent said nothing since the 16th or the 18th, what ever was the last time i wrote. and i forgot what happened so i'll just tell u what i do remember. change of subject real quick...I LOVE SARAH!!!!!!!!!!! ok back to writtin....so much has happened, but i'll just start from the 20th. that day i think i went to pool but i dont remember, and when ever i got home i went to katies house and helped clean up the basement. we did a good job. we decorated it all up in a halloween manner, it looks sooooooo cool. then i got to spend the night. we had a good time. when we wanted to go to bed we all slept down there. it was kinda uncomfortable, only cuz katie had the whole end of the bed so me and alex had to curl up at the top. neway when we woke up me and katie went over to my house then we were gonna go to the pool but decided not to and went to go hang out with scott and aaron. we had fun over there then went over by kts house for her little shindig that she was having. we hung out in the basement for a while, then lauryn came over and hung with us. we had pizza it was good. then luann (kts mom) went to bunco or whatever that is and then we just had a good ol time. we listened to this creepy music we all were scared but scott wasnt, curse u....just playin. then after while we played spin the bottle/dice. it was soooooooooo much fun. and then, scott and aaron went home and me and lauryn stayed till ten and then went home, she spent the night at my house and we got online, we talked to alex and krystine. then asked alex if he was gonna go to the pool and he said no hes goin over to danielles house, then we started dissin on her just sayin how she kinda creeped us out. (just to let u know alex, i'm sorry bout that i should just get to know her b4 i say more stuff...if u told her that we talked bout her tell her i'm sorry and i'd like to get to know her) then once everyone else was off we just had fun not being able to type it was so funny. then we watched movies, it was almost 8 b4 we fell asleep. then that was my day. on friday, scott and aaron came over and hung out with us for a while. during that time lauryn threatened to castrate aaron with a butterknife. he didnt know what that ment so he asked, my mom told him and he was like nooooo please dont then he asked is there any way to castrate a gurl and my mom told him yea. then him and scott wanted to know what a "cl*t" was and she kinda in a way told them. then i brought down a book and showed them. it was soooooooo funny. scott started educating us on stuff about the girls and what they go through and might encounter. it was so funny. then my mom said something that scarred aaron and he went running outta my house lauryn was chasing him. then scott was flippin through the pages and found a picture of a penis (quiver) and laughed at it. i showed my mom what it looked like and she said that it looked like a broccoli. i ran outta that house so fast. then when i came back in my mom was laughing cuz scott had said 3 down 1 to go. omg it was so funny. then kt came over and we left and hung around. when we got over by central park aaron left cuz ppl were pissin him off. then we went over by my grandmas house and played hide-n-seek. we are so weird...good thing. then lauryn had to go home. after while we met back up with aaron and went over to katies house and hung out in the basement. there we just chilled. when everyone left, i went home to and ate yummy chicken. then katie came over at about 930 and we kinda in a sucky way played volleyball. then just did flips and crap. she went home and i got back online. then got off watched some movies till my mom fell asleep and got back on at like 1. there i talked to lauryn and alex. at that time he broke up with me.....:( i'm still kinda sad bout that but i'll get over it...hopefully. yea the i talked to lauryn bout it and she said...well she just felt bad for me after while i got off. then listened to blink182 and fell asleep. when i woke up i had to go to my grandmas for her birth day and i had a good time for a while the i wanted to leave and i kept trying to tell my mom that but she was like u got two feet and keys...walk. so i did i walked past the pool to see who was there and i ran into aaron kt and scott. they left with me and went to my house. from there me and kt went to get our bikes and and rode over to aarons house. we stayed there till 530 then went over to taco bell the over to lauryns then went to mohawk then lost kt and me and aaron and scott went over by sarahs then to blackhawk then they went to the jumps and i went home. 20 minutes after i got home kt finally came back over. she was spendin the night. then we were gonna go to central park and ran into aaron and scott again. they went to aarons house to get stuff and then we went back to my house and hung out, they stayed till 11. but during that time.......oh nevermind, i'll just say that there were some sad moments going on. then they left and we went in and played with legos and blah blah blah, then we finally went to bed. kt fell asleep first then i did. when we woke up i took a shower and got dressed...obviously. and then we watched bringing down the house..funny funny movie. then talked to christina on the phone. like at around 12 aaron and scott and christina came over and we all went to walgreens. then scott and aaron went to aarons house and me and kt took our stuff to my house and then christina went home. me and kt went to aarons house. and then we all left. kt went to her dads house and i stayed with aaron and scott. after while my dad came by and then i went with him to dinner and had a good time. then when i got home i called katie and i spent the night at her dads. when i got there i got to meet the new kittens....they are soooooooo soooo cute...my favortie is the orange one...cubby. shame alex dont even know his own cats names..lol!

(in my opinion they looked kinda funny) but owell, who am i to judge? so anthony caught up with them and they talked....skipping all that. but in the end anthony and that HOPE chick started goin out, not her and nicho like it was intended. during some of that time me alex and lauryn went over by a hill and just had fun..not in that way. and then me and her had to go home. then she left to go to her house. and i was at mine...fun fun fun...NOT! yea then alex, kyle, nicho, and anthony showed up and shit started...not gettin into that but lets just say when we all got to alex and kts ppl were kinda sorta in a way stalkin us. now onto the 5th. did nothing really well in the morning. i woke up at 11 again. and talked to katie and she came over. then i talked to mondo trying to work something out and him and alan and miguel came over, it was fun. we all hung out..by the way mondo is really comfortable and smells really good. different story though. and yea. well hours passed and we just goofed around and then my mommy got home. and she took us all to skating. there these guys were being major assholes. grrrrrrrrrrr!! we were gettin so pissed. but got over it in a good time. then we jsut skated and hung out. go figure!!!!! there i got married to kaleigh. yay! lol! and i told mondo wut happened between me and a couple of my friends at my house and i only told him cause i felt really bad about it afterward. and so now were just holding off till skool starts when we see eachother. and miguel and katie go out now too this all happened at skating. so that was my day. and when i got home i got online and talked then kt got on and now i'm on again. so there u have it...........ridas last few days gone by! lol! much luv all!!
