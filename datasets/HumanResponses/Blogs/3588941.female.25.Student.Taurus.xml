      Here is part of a quote I recently received that got me to thinkin'...   "The mania for recreations of various kinds which has seized upon many of the people is harmful in several ways. It unfits them for the regular duties of life. It renders them restless and impatient of proper restraint. It obstructs business. It tends to contract habits of dissipation. It throws our young folks into the company of persons whose society should be shunned. It cultivates worldliness. It conduces to many evils, and the spirit of purity, temperance, holiness and peace will not abide..."  Our society is based so much on amusement and (instant) gratification. We have a false sense of deservedness that causes us to strive for happiness through attainment of wealth, possessions, and etc. As a byproduct, our country is overwhelming debt. Recently, I heard figures of around 26 or 28 thousand dollars per household average debt rate, not including mortgage. I can only say one thing about that… sick. What are we thinking!?  Why do we deserve so much that we put ourselves, and other through the general economy (who pays the debt when we can’t, ie bankruptcy), at such great risk!?  I know that there are a great number of problems in this world. And in my person opinion, I believe each us, individually, could fix a great majority of them, if the efforts were made to live with a love for others rather than ourselves. This grandiose statement reminds of another quote that was used by a good friend of mine…  "Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible!"   some more thoughts along these lines, go to  urlLink www.zaadz.com

      Arete explained...   definition:   aretê [Arês]  1. goodness, excellence, of any kind, esp. of manly qualities, manhood, valour, prowess, Hom., Hdt. (like Lat. vir-tus, from vir). 2. rank, nobility, Theogn., Eur. 3. in Prose, generally, goodness, excellence in any art, Plat., etc.; of animals or things, Hdt., attic. 4. in moral sense, goodness, virtue, Plat., etc.:--also character for virtue, merit, Eur., etc. 5. ar. eis tina service done him, Thuc.; ar. peri tina Xen.    summary:  The most articulated value in Greek culture is arete. Translated as "virtue," the word actually   means something closer to "being the best you can be," or "reaching your highest human potential." In the Homeric poems, arete is frequently associated with bravery, but more often, with effectiveness. The man or woman of arete is a person of the highest effectiveness; they use all their faculties: strength, bravery, wit, and deceptiveness, to achieve real results. In the Homeric world, then, arete involves all of the abilities and potentialities available to humans. The concept implies a human-centered universe in which human actions are of paramount importance; the world is a place of conflict and difficulty, and human value and meaning is measured against individual effectiveness in the world.     To Aristotle, arete is explicitly linked with human knowledge. Plato repeatedly returns to the question of arete, and the evidence of his earliest writings suggest that Socrates, Plato's teacher, was equally obsessed with the question. The famous Socratic paradox, "Virtue is knowledge," is in Greek, "Arete is knowledge." This would be the foundation of both Socratic and Platonic philosophy: the highest human potential is knowledge and all other human abilities are derived from this central capacity. Aristotle also locates the highest human potential in knowledge: theoretical knowledge. If arete is knowledge and study, the highest human knowledge is knowledge about knowledge itself; in this light, the theoretical study of human knowledge, which Aristotle called "contemplation," is the highest human ability and happiness.   Just something to think about...

      "Don't undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible." ~ Edwin Land  To me, doing this weblog is both important and a near impossibility. First, off I lack the effort and consistency to make this work. And secondly, I lack the creativity and verbal skills to make it interesting, or successful. However, it is a project that I have been interested in trying. And so on that note... I will.

       "Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one's dreams. In what other way can one deal with them? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being."  ~ Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) Austrian founder of psychoanalysis  As I half-awoke from a dream a few mornings ago I had a strange thought, "How was I so surprised by my own dream?". It was a curious thought, which wouldn't be as strange if someone else were dreaming for me... but they don't! My mind creates the dream, so I shouldn't be surprised, or frighten, or any of those emotions that occur because of a lack of prior knowledge of an event. Maybe you don't understand, maybe you do... dreams are such curious things!
