      It's the end of the year. Wow, that was quick. I hope next year won't have a similar "duration", I'd like to enjoy my teenage years thank you very much. I just cant help but think, soon I'm going to be on my death bed, thinking to myself, damn, that was quick.  However dear friends, our lives are in real time and not virtual manifestations. There is no menu, calibration, setting, save or reload.  There is just "Now" and a nanosecond later there'll be a "Then". For now there will always be a "Later", till "Later" when there will be slightly less of a "Later" than "Then". Umm, yeah.  So, anyways, it was a good year. The O'levels are done. No big deal. I have no regrets. What is done is done and cannot be undone. I learnt that from a girl. A special Girl. That's a funny word - Girl... sounds like a noise an animal would make like GRRRR, or SUQAK or MOOOO or HELLO, HOW DO YOU DO?  Next year, I will strive to be academically proficient or at least consistant. I also hope to spend a lot more time furthering my talents in music and drama. Ordinary it may be for now; wait.  You just wait and see.

      Hey there. Sorry I havn't done this in a while. Was ill and busy. Actually, I don't see the point of doing this. What's it for? Maybe, If I devolop a habbit (haha... habbit hobbit), I'll print it all out and start a written diary for my eyes only, and maybe my wife's if we decide to cuddle up on the couch, by the fire and go through the old diaries. What can I say. I think I'm what they call a die hard romantic. I don't like the sound of that though.  Ok, about yesterday's performance at the Brakefluid E.P. session. I'm thoroughly disappointed at my band's errors. Disappointed, ashamed, distressed, whatever. The mistakes that were made shouldn't have been made. Call it what you want, a learning experience, a first time, a whatever. Whatever.   I'm perfectionist. And I know what I'm capable of and I sure as hell am capable of the best.  What sucks is if the band screws up, it's on me because I'm the frontman. Damn.  I'll make it someday. You just see.  You just wait.

      I'm terribly ill today. Don't feel like writing much today. Ironic that the 2 vocalists in Oracion are down with soar throats. That coupled with the fact that we're 2 days away from the gig on the 29th. Highly gay ill shat. kae serah serah, whatever will be will be. the future's not ours to see. key serah serah.

      Boxing Day.   Today is usually an Excruciatingly, Horrendously, Supercalifriagilically painful day for some. Usually because they now reside within this fragile thing, a "lifestyle" if i were bold enough to term it one; called normalcy.   Today is the day in which millions over the globe pack their Christmas Trees into their old, crumpled, torn, soft and mildewed, brown cardboard boxes. The time when they pack the fun and festivities away and return to life as they know it. (Mind you, I'm not one to use the word "life" likely, just as various other aquaintences of mine do with thier attempt to start a conversation disguised as the common and i mean COMMON enqiry of, "So Tim, how's Life".) Screw that. I'll probablly write about that tomorrow. So anyway, It's symbolism.  Ironic too due to the very fact that the warmth of Christmas is intended to last one through the year, hauling along with it, jargon like good will towards men and the like. Instead, for some, the glow's gone the very next day. Tragic.  Odd. If I had a choice, I'd live Christmas daily. I'd bet I'd live longer too. There's this guy in England who does (as in literally). I saw him on Guiness.   God bless his jolly soul.

      It's Christmas Day. I have several wishes for the world. 1) That more and more people come to know our dear Lord and Saviour. 2) That unrest would come to a stand-still for at least a day. 3) That someone's life would be touched by the North Star. 4) That people love instead of hate. 5) That Jesus comes soon.  Additionally I would like to add one or two wishes for myself. 1) That God would be pleased with what he sees in me. 2) That by a miracle, I'd get Zel back.  A risky post, I am fully aware of the implications. At the moment i'm not really sure where my heart lies. I choose to be thankful for who and what I have at present.  I'm thankful for a roof over my head and a God who loves me, over my roof. I'm thankful for Mummy, Aunty Delia, Natasha, Ian, Pati, Tata and Daddy, wherever he is. I'm thankful that they love me. I'm thankful that i have friends whom i love and that they love me unconditionally in return. I'm thankful for my salvation. I'm thankful for Zel I give thanks for many things... and i am able to do so because i choose to look at the good side of things, and not the bad. I choose.  Thank you Jesus for You and Choice.

      World falls; fails. Earth crumbles. My drapes were rainbow, now they're dull. Now you only see the kaleidoscope when rays permeate. I don't like the rays, they burn me. She was like them, warm and nice. Now, it FUCKING burns. Through air, it stings like it stings. My trophies on the inside were the best times gone by. Irreplaceable. The plaques in the open-aired shelf reflect nothing- nothing through faded fake gold. Spiderman turns his face from me while Baal looks me in the eye. He calls to me - he who is inclined to answer is indeed a desperate pilot. I long for my day in may once more. Anniversary.

      As of today, I slowly come to the realization that many people have their fair share of problems. One's got parental problems and is falling from God, another one's got parental problems and has got her home phone line cut due to outstanding bills, another one's got her aunt in hospital and a very ill mom at home. Man!  Damn! I can't believe I've *swear word*ing been spelling intellectual wrong this whole *swear word*ing time.   What have I got? A broken home, A broken heart, A broken dream. HurraH! Despite the many daunting problems my peers may be facing, I refuse and I say firmly REFUSE to believe that I have been self-centered. Contrary to what some may adamantly choose to believe. I don't have anyone close to me dying yet, but I am. Dying to realize my dream, to go places, to do things with my life. Things that I want to do. Perhaps then, it won't be a dream. On the other hand, the realization of it may prove so blissful, it would be justified, only to call it a dream. All this, though the odds seem insurmountable.  I envy Desiree. You reading this darling? She is young, but her mind is beautiful. I am at a loss for words. Am I a sucker for ladies with interesting and different minds? Why can't I find intellectuals in most places I go? Desiree writes. I want to be able to do that too. Different style you say? Screw you. I want to be able to do that. Check this out mate.  urlLink http://sub-way.diaryland.com  and  urlLink http://blitzkrieg.blogspot.com  This nut of a gem, is into photography, music as in real MUSIC and so much more.  urlLink http://epithet.blogspot.com   Desire indeed.

       Hello. Have been ill for about 2.25 days now. Homework is backlogged pretty badly. I'm worried about that. I don't like school. I want my Fairfield. She's still in my head.   Inferiority complexes. From what I have come to understand, There are three types. It's very intriguing, this whole concept of feeling low. Who's to judge a man's worth but He who created man? Why would one feel like a lesser being in the first place? I think, it could be attributed to one of two factors or both. The individual's surroundings and psychology.  One type is that which lowers himself to the pits. Yap, are you reading this man? They are actually worth a lot more than they realize. Yap plays the guitar and drums, is good at pool and C.S., is handsome and has a heartwarming smile. He's got a good ear for harmonies and an even better heart. His friends wonder, many a time, why he hangs with company which doesn't do much good to his self esteem.  The other type is another boy I knew when I was in Sec 3 and 4. This version prompts the individual to make themselves out to be much greater than they actually are. This boy THINKS he sings really well and is really REALLY suave with the ladies. That he's really handsome and extremely interlectual. That he knows his rights and that he's always and I mean ALWAYS right. An expert in the field of astrophysics and quantum theory. He's got quite a few fathers I've heard. Day one: "My dad works in the army in a top secret faction". Day two: "My dad works as a Pilot at S.I.A.". Day three: "My dad works at N.A.S.A.". HHHHAhahahahahahaha!!!!! Really, need I say much more? Either that, or he had a very very active mother.   There's this other guy I know now in college. He cracks too many Indian jokes. Pretty offensive stuff if you ask me. So, why does he have inferiority complex? He's Indian, that's why. The way I see it is like this, he cracks the Indian jokes, people laugh at him, he feels good and accepted and hurrah, he's accepted. He dosen't realize that he's already accepted regardless of the percentage of melanin content in his skin. He should stop trying to impress or humor. Never the less, he is a nice guy. Gotta hand that to him.  Why the hell did I do this today?

      It happens. It's like a film strip pasted together at both ends with weak paper glue and put on a projector. Deja vu. It runs with not-so-delicate repetition. She kills me again, over and over, cold steel once warm which I treasured having inside me. That which keeps me alive, never ceasing, pumping, is also my enemy. He works against me, malignant tumor.  Why does this occur? I ask of thee to not misunderstand my intents. I complain not and, fully, am I aware that everyone endures the same punishment as I. All I ask is why? We request it not, yet it is. Romeo died with Juliet and Paris killed because of it. Why is it that something so immensely and indescribablly beautiful; tenders too, the most intense and immense anguish and grief. Grief prolonged by the wanting of it and subdued by that which kills. In the words of a great poet of my time, why'd you have to go make things so complicated. Why love? Why?

      Ok, I have to admit it, the teacher is quite a fox. She's fresh out of Uni and she's in the national soft-ball team. OUch! Hot!  However, economics on the other hand isn't as appealing to me. The definitions are so rigid, I could throw freaking boulders through the holes in the stupid thing. I mean really, urgh, I'm tired of a lot of things. I think I'm loosing my writers edge. Maybe, I just don't have the time to write anything solid. I promise a good one soon ok?  It'll be on inferiority complexes. Yap, you reading this man? ahahaha! Shitz lorzxz! I soundz like bengz lorx~  Alright, I am overly taxed, if you hadn't guessed by now it's fine, I'm not sure if I'm making sense anymore. Fingers tired, eyes LITERALLY closing. Need shut down... head nodding off. Really, I noo shita youa.  Good Byexzxzxzxz

      Hello. I'm ok today. Zel's still in my head but I was occupied with a temporary game of survivor today. The same game as a couple of weeks ago.  I had only 2hrs and 6mins of sleep last night. Then, I rushed to church with a running nose. Sang at service for the Lord. I tried my best. He's happy, I think.  After the game of survivor, some of us stayed at Leon's place. It's nice, his place with white exterior, well kept, and with pretty purple orchids in moss-covered charcoal. I might be dangerous, all that dampness. I love my U.W.C. friends. Well, almost all of them. The girls are almost perfect and the boys are quite alright too. Don't worry, I'm asking myself the same question as you are right now, "What the hell am I doing there?" right?  However, often enough, I find "STIMULATING, interlectual jargon" unappealing and monotonous. Some of it interests me occasionally, and getting it weekly or fortnightly or monthly is fine. It's nice t be able to talk to people who can talk back. We had fun.  I'm confused, tired and depressed. I require maintenance.

      I'm at Sunands place now. It's late and I'm tired. I don't wanna sleep. Something might happen tomorrow whilst I'm singing. I hope not.  I'm still thinking of her today. I don't wanna forget. I can, can't I? I think I can. Oh crap, I'm not sure. In doubt of my own ability to disown something I love. At least it proves that I have a heart. Thanks.  I don't feel I have much to thank God for. Though I know I owe Him my life, it seems that giving thanks for my breath would be a pathetic attempt to scrounge for a reason to give thanks.  I hope I'm not left out of the book of life for what I feel. Shan't elaborate any further, lest I come under reprimandative fire and inquiry as to whether or not I am fully equipped with limbs. F.I.S.H. knows what I mean.  Leave me not out of the book of life.

      I'm blank today. Didn't run again today, but I did do 50 benches. About 15 kg. Pathetic I know, but it's a start. I start too late. I do everything too late. I promised Zel that I'd get fit for her, she laughed it off and said that she was fine with a cuddly teddy-bear.  What use is a cuddly teddy-bear it you're not going to cuddle it? I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart. Freakily falsettoish. If you get the chance, go listen to The darkness's I believe in a thing called love. The MTV is hell weird, but it gets good after a while.  She was sensitive. I was impatient.  Thinking now I wonder, was it my fault? It was almost prefect, was she the one? I couldn't take it, was I a fool? naive to this new game, was it my last round?  There's something I wanted to say; I've forgotten.  There's nothing I have left to loose.

      I was a slob today. Sat around doing nothing. Guitar. Television. SMS. Oh, but I swept the floor around the coffee table at 10.17pm. Love letter crumbs on he floor; under the couch; on the couch. Shudder.  I should thank Zel for something she did about 6 months ago... Maybe more. I was hit in the eye really hard by a gala pole. Really hard. We (Fatt, I and Nicholas Leow) were playing with poles and a roll of masking tape. Choir room at Queensway. Oh boy! I was on the floor. Someone ran and got Zel, Zel ran and bought ice. Zel ran back to me in the choir room with the ice in a plastic bag. She sat beside me, whilst I, being the immensely big baby I am with the incomparably high threshold for pain lay there. Just groaning... Pitifully pitiful. I wouldn't call it disgusting. It did hurt.  I have to thank her. Weird how it comes back. The little things. The suttle things. I was special to her. I've got the tendency to feel indebted. I am.  I am.

      I saw her in school today. God! She was so pretty! Really! Lamentations should have been written by me. I missed her smile, I forgot it was sunshine. My sunshine. She looked like she'd lost weight too. She wore a plain off white top with jeans, that's her style, I'll never forget it. Seeing that brought back Sundays we had. I used to be happy, then, a while ago. To I, an age.  She can't come for badminton this Saturday with F.I.S.H. I wish she would. I wonder if she thinks of me as much as I think of her. I hope so. It gets lonely.  I'm not the bad guy.  I had a great chat with Miss Lim and Mr Low in the office today. They were great. I miss them dearly. I went to Mrs Koh's after that, bearing gifts from far away lands. A pomelo from Ipoh and Persimmons from Israel.  The brand? - "Sharon's" No kidding! I'm stopping here. Sam's going to read this. Hi Sam!

      Felt quite down today. Don't know why. Depression is an illness. It sickens me. My classmates are different people. Some show genuine concern, some total disregard, some utter incompetence.  I just stopped to stare at my lava lamp. I haven't turned it on in ages. It's blue. It makes funny shapes as it melts. Almost looks like a fetus sometimes. Intriguing.  You know what I wanna do? I wanna go lie down in a field on a breezy day. It's funny how your mind makes you see figures in the clouds. First it's a squid, then it's a sailboat, then it's an aeroplane. What's cool is that your mind does it. Squid and sailboat are related by the sea. The boat and plane, by modes of transportation. What the hell am I talking about?  The lava's messy now. I feel like I'm losing the complexity of my mind. Becoming.. "Normal" UrgGhH!  I miss Zel. Going to school tomorrow to meet the boys. Hopefully I'll see her. I miss Zel. Oh, I've said that already. Goodnight.

      Hello. I am feeling slightly better now. Only slightly lah mike. She's not going to come back. I can't accept that. Poor Joe Tan. Now I know.  Today I watched "Gu Zhon" players work their magic. I was entirely mesmerized by the fluidity of the music. Their hands and fingers, they were like smooth brease. Like a zephyr. The effort was seemingly fastidious yet, at the same time, calm. It's all juxtaposition.  I'm going to finish Guitar, move on to bass, finalise precussion, Take on the piano by the time I'm 20. Then, I'll move on to the Gu Zhong. My my... would you look at that. Dripping with nieveity.  I'm in a game of survivor. Prize money is $60K. Enough to educate the children of 20 Ethiopian villages. Not my will, but God's be done.  There's alot on my mind now. It's quite chaotic in there. Lord, grant me the wisdom to know the difference. For you who reads this, sieze the day. Tell someone you love them. Not appreciate them, or are thankful for them, but that you love them.  Goodnight.  H2l

      I'm falling I'm loosing my dreams. Is it I who is loosing my dreams? Is that gramatically correct? Did I spell "gramatically" correct? Zel loves me. Ditto for I. Yet there lies a wall. Like a soap opera. She says fuck love. I beg to differ. Love love. I feel suicidal. Almost everything is lost. Here is gone. Please. Someone, Anyone. Help me. Suicide is unrealistic. I need help.

      Shane's here today. I am happy. I am tired. Physically and mentally. I can't remember alot of my sec 4 work. I'm worried. There's lots to do. Too much. I wanted to write  song with Shane, but looks like we're both prerrt tired. Wait, I just asked him if he was tired and he said no. Looks like I'm the tired one. Shane is strong. Full of muscles. Incredible. He's sitting with his shirt off beside me. Huray! I wish I were like Shane. I wish I were like Shane. Haiz. I dont believe I just said that. I'm tired. Goodnight.

        Butterflies    They do nothing for one. Yet they be one's closest companions in times of insecurity. Fluttering, flipping, flopping, flirting. It tingles. It's strange.  They're here. With me now. I attempt emulating nonchalance. Daniel Koh. I can! I can't; I fail. Actors fooling themselves. Denial.  I am afraid of what the future holds. I want to doctor in nikeology. Just doing it. I can't finish this. I don't know how.  Daddy told me. He really did. They're never going to do anything good for you. That I should dispose of them. Loose them. Throw them away.  But they keep coming. They never leave. An unwilling alliance.

      I feel like I missed something. I'm sorry. Don't incuire as to why. Returned from the UWC thing yesterday. It was Discouraging. Everyone there is like woah. I mean, there's no doubt I have my talents, but these guys are something special. Everyone is from like ACJC, RJC, HCJC, NJC. Damn.  It was something like survivor. Undoubtedly, the thought of putting on a face had crossed everyone's mind. Some did. Definitely. I know I tried my best to  be me.  I'm just worried about the things people say. Even if they don't realise it. My heart is heavy. Burdened. Yolked. I don't like it.  I don't like getting my hopes all up and all then falling all the way to the bottom. It would be a real drag. I need to pray for serenity.  My mind is crowded. STOP YELLING! SHUT UP! PLEASE... SHUT UP! shut up. I've forgotten what I wanted to say.  Econs is a wolf in sheep's clothing. A science disguised as an art with words poorly stuck onto the surface with paper glue. I see through it. Disgusting. Limitations are inhibitions. Liars, Thieves.  Help. I'm going nucking futs.

      I've got my UWC interview in less than 7 hours... I havn't even packed my clothes yet... It's a camp.  I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't kow what I'm going to say. I will be myself, but is being myself enough or too much. Due to the fact that I have a charismatic character... I'm afraid they feel I'm putting on a facade.  Ok... I've decided to be myself. Blogging is good. I type what I think. But i won't go far enough to call it an "expression". Or is it. ?.  I'm talking to Suriani now. She's very sweet. I like talking to her. Friends are few and far apart. She's one. She cares.  I miss Zel very badly. To the point it hurts. It really does. Not just emotionally, but I feel a physical constriction in my "inside"... I don't know how to put it. The thoughts squeeze me from the inside. Not just anyone knows about my blog. Just my closest friends. So I suppose saying this here is ok.  I have to go now. It hurts.

      I'm sitting here. It's 0044hrs right now. I'm sweaty and stickey. Just ran. I need a shower. I need to get fit. I will. In time I will.  Let me write about eyes today. It really intrigues me that so many people in my college have coloured eyes. Like a friggin rainbow. Yellow, blue, green, grey. The problem is, that the pigments don't really boost one's image. Not in my sight at least. On the other hand, I might consider it a sign of weakness. One of insecurity. Why not be who you are. presenting yourself to people without having to hide behind a pseudo-image. Being hip and trendy, funky and posh? Give me a friggin break lah. It somes from the inside. People will see it. Fell it. If you're reading this, I sincerely hope it speaks to you.  On the other hand, there was this one exceptional case. She's got hazel eyes. They're natural. What is it with me and this word "hazel"?! Stunningly beautiful. Truly, I am at a loss for words. She is an ordinary Jane, but those eyes... Couple that with a debaitor's mind and... I shall stop here...  She's nice.. reminds me of Claire abit. Oh well. My heart is still somewhere in hillview, in a 7-story house, in the pocket of another debaitor. Then again, what is it with me and debaitors!?  Goodness!

      greetings. I come from Farifield but am being "strongly encouraged" to swear allegiance to Pioneer JC. Am confused. Should the past, to me, be true to its definition? I'm sentimental. 10 years is a long time.  My O.G. group is great. We're bonded. In a superficial sort of way. There are four stages to the creation of a successful organisation. The group dynamic alters as time pogresses. I think the four stages go something like this. Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing. Now, we're at forming. everyone puts on a charade, a facade, a mask. That will change with time. I don't wish to ponder the outcome of the relationships formed with my new-found acquaintances. I choose to enjoy the now.

      Sabbath.  I am sticking to my resolutions. I am pleased with myself. I will be a better person in '04, be it, feel it, different or not.  I have decided to take 670. The option comprises of General Paper, C math, Economics, Chemistry and Tamil. Mother tongue. Derived from "Tongue of the motherland" I'm sure. I was also called for the second round of interviews for the U.W.C. scholarship. I know I should feel... happy... I don't. WHY?  There is no, and I mean NO music like the oldies. The veterans like Queen. That's what it's all about. Vocal harmonies in over 4 different parts. Never would I have fathomed that it were feasible, let alone entirely possible. Well, then again, I probablly would've thought of it but would have been too lazy to do anything about the notion.  I miss Hazel so much. There hasn't been a day I havn't thought of her. I just spent 4 hours putting together notes for her from my sec 4 papers. What the hell kind of "just a friend" am I? This is usually the part people break into their overy interlectual jargon which people dont understand but read anyway. I suppose, in a way, be it subconsious or not, the author of this smack feels.. what? smart? clever? unique?  Gimme a break. Good night.

      Hi. I'm upset. I'm invisible. I'm not in ACJC. I'm loosing my dreams of becoming a star.  It will go soon. However, exactly what will go is highly subjective. Will the depreciation go or will the aspiration? time will tell. If only it'd open it's fatass gap earlier.  PJC is a bore. The orientation thing was ill planned and they had us in the hall practically the whole day. Then, they made us play very very stupid and POINTLESS games. I mean it. I shan't elaborate. I made the best out of it. Didn't wanna say anything to offend the nice leader boy...  Help... God... Help

      Today was uneventful. Doing cleaning. I want to get rid of stuff, but just cant. Sentimental fool! I was called a "snag" once by this chick in school. I THINK being a snag is a good thing right?  Going to school tomorrow. Don't know if I'm looking foreward to it. We'll see.

      Miss Lim started to speak. It was cold and she was overly frank. It served to distress and wake-up. Somewhere deep down, my resolution lay- Thy will be done. It was difficult to make out in the thick uneasiness. Blurred, diminished, fuzzed, faded, like a disrupted signal from a live broadcast. We queued my register number and I prayed whilst Shi Hui took her 11. I sat down and looked as Mrs Chew dismally. 13, and I deliberately asked her to repeat herself twice. The twins, and a couple of others were there. Hugs and congratulations all around. I was pleased. I thanked my teachers and they thanked me.   It hit me later that Leon got 11 and I got thirteen. I'm not sure what to call it. Jealousy? Envy? What? I know it shouldn't be there. It's just that we did so much work together and well, how did that happen? Ironic huh? So much for resolving to stick with thy will be done. I spoke to Des and Zel about it. They both seem to think that it's perfectly normal to feel this way. Bro, I know you'll be reading this soon. Hold it not against me. It's just that you're my bar for a lot of things and you just keep getting better and better.  Look lah, Who's better at Academics Sports Music Public Relations Religion Morals and Values Relationships.  Shit lah. I'm not overjoyed with thirteen, I'm just happy. After all, I was hoping for 15. To God be the glory. Well God, here's another problem for you to help me fix.

      Tonight, I am on the phone with darling Miss Wu (Mike), hence, we will be writing tonight's entry together- since she's got nothing better to do than to hang with a bismil like me.  I wish upon a star that tomorrow will be a good day. A day that will live on in infamy, or in our lives anyway... Tomorrow, to state the obvious, is dooms day. D-day, DA day, yar. lar. Mike.  I remember, a wear ago, on this day, Miss E.Lim, brought us to the hall for a wake up call. And we were all like "oh man! I need to leave so that I can go home and study NOW!!!!!" I think I was sitting with Kester. So tomorrow, will be deja vu. Except in a different sort of way. I'll be on the real receiving end.  I knew without a doubt that I wanted to open my envelope with only one person beside me. Things have changed now and although I would like to cry to her, I'm now embarrassed to. It's complicated. I feel twisted inside. Twisted in a confused sort of way. Am I making any sense? Yes I am. Oh great, now I'm answering my questions and talking to myself? What next? Anyway, I asked her, and she said that she'd sit with me. I'm not sure if that's what I want, but I'll take it and see how it goes. I love her. I know this is love. It isn't unrequited. It's just a semi-acknowledged mutual love. Err... ya, see, I told you it was complicated.  I'm slightly nervous, but not really. I don't really think about it that much. I am hoping for the best and expecting the worst. That way, when I get a scrape, I'll be joyful. Another wonderful theory brought to you by Leon .Inc. I will look at it this way, just as I do for all major events in my life henceforth.  Thy will be done.

      Well love, here's an interesting take on it. When/ if we go to heaven and see everyone there, we'd see everyone who's supposed to be there. That's coz there's no concept of time. There would have never been a then nor a future, just a constant now. It's as hard to put into words as it is to grasp. So basically, ya... Feel free to tag me or ask me on msn bout it ya?  Anonymous, please feel free to use your name or a nick if you please. The comment you made sounds like something a New Creation member would say. I do believe that the 10 commandments are very applicable, even in today's context. Some things never loose their meaning, friend. One thing we have to do is humble ourselves and realize, that we're still sinners, no matter what we do right or wrong. Keep posting dude. Good to have discussion.  On a lighter note, I think my wisdom teeth are coming out. I can almost reach 'em with my tongue. Was out with Rayner till pretty late. He's very nice to talk to and there's a fountain of knowledge which just flows from him. He knows the market and he knows things. He's a lady's man, a definite Leopold. What a rocker. Talented musician and not a show off at all..  Results will be out tomorrow. Very nervous. The more I think about it, the more I think that I'll get 17 or something. God forbid. Still, "Thy will be done"

      Hello. I am happy today. I don't know why, it's just one of those things. I think less of her, but still drift into the occasional dream world again. Old habits die hard. She wants me to let go. I'm not going to do that, but I have to accept that she's not mine anymore. She just told me that there's this gay drama teacher who's getting TOO CLOSE to the students, and I feel like beating the shit out of the homo pervert if he touches her. SEE!There I go again.  I think I've got a crush on this girl in my class, but I keep getting held back by the memories. But I think it's like a small crush lah mike. I think I may have too many requirements. That she should be younger than I, that she shouldn't be Indian, that she should be intellectual, that she should be Christian, that she should have a history of commitment or maybe no history at all but believes in commitment. I'm not sure, if that's too much to ask? And after all these requirements have been fulfilled, am I left with no fish in the sea?  Just spoke to my friend. Realized that many makes treat girls as a commodity. "She's taken", "She's mine"... shit...  We won today's debate- THBT pop culture exploits the weak. And we were the opp, which made our case even harder to fight. Muahahaha!!!  Later

      I'm now semi-messed-up and semi-relieved.  Had a good talk with her and she understands now- about why I did it.  I'm not sure if she believes me though. It'd be a crying shame if she didn't.  She knows that I still love her. However she doesn't wanna tell me if the sentiment is reciprocated. Wonder what that means.   I will let time take it's course. Thy will be done.   I have to stop swearing, but the more I do, the more I tend to see Christianity as following blindly what an old book says. Believing in something that cannot be proven. I don't know lah.   Think about this. Because I'm Christian, I'm saved eternally. Eternally meaning timeless. Therefore, when I go to heaven, I'd immediately got to know who made it there Coz everyone would be there already. However, for everyone to be there already, time would have to have passed for everyone to be there already wouldn't it? And even then, when would judgment day be? So is heaven still timeless. Heaven is devoid of time and space. But then, where would the roads of gold go? If they're only descriptions of what heaven is like, then how much of the bible is comprised of mere "descriptions"?   I don't mean to sway anyone, but I was just thinking.

      I'm confused and happy. A happy-sad sort of confused. Happy first. Pioneer: I've made many many new friends in Pioneer. Most of the people there like me I suppose. It's close to home and there could be a lot of opportunity for me. I might lead the choir and get into the council. I would be a big fish in a small pond. Not sure academics wise though.  ACJC: From what I gather, the school sucks you dry- financially and the teachers don't really give much of a damn. They expect us to be "highly self-motivated" people. In addition, the powerful posts are dominated by ACSi and MGS students. It's hard for a Fairsian to make it big in ACJC. Their choir is good, but it's difficult to get in. If I join the choir, I wont be able to join the council. So do I give up my passion for leading or my passion for singing. I'd never even consider the latter, but there is a choice to be made. Good part is that I can walk over to my alma mater as and when I please. She's be there. Just seeing her face would be good enough.  Confused about Zel. She doesn't wanna tell me if she still loves me. Wonder why. Not sure, but wont give up. She just told me to fuck off when I told her that I wasn't going to leave it alone, that I wasn't going to stop hoping. That's the only thing that I live for now. There's nothing else. She said that she was confused, trapped and frustrated when we fought. I'm thinking, well, I sure as hell didn't do that. Just because I don't acknowledge it, doesn't mean that I don't feel similarly. All I've got is a faded picture of her in my mind and an affectionate name to call to the air in despair. Why are you trying to face what little I have from me. Love is about holding on. Till death do us part. I'll never let go Rose, I'll never let go. I'm all melancholic now.  It's funny, I was going to write about how great my day went. Now look at me. Pining over my hopes again. My hopes, my memories, my emotions, my being, my loss. Remember my girlfriend fate, with the twisted hands? She caressed me again, felt queasy.  Yesterday, shitty day----> better than shitty day.  Today, Great day (night actually)----> Very shitty night.  Suicide is not an option. An alternative may be something equally SCARRRING.

      Crappy day. Recount. Went to school, bummed for 4 hours, sang for 20 minutes. Told a teacher off to his face that he was being rude for about 5 minutes. Went to West Mall and chilled with Angeline for about 30 minutes. Decided to take a 173 home to relive something. Changed to 970 and helped a lady retrieve her fluorescent yellow highlighter. It fell to the ground as she boarded. Sat beside a sleeping Indian who woke up and began cursing and swearing at the bus driver, calling him an incompetent dumb driver who must have been from Johor. He said that if the bus driver were a smart driver, he'd be "driving" a plane. I was greatly amused my a ranting madman after a shitty day.  Thank you God for ranting madmen on buses who amuse us.

      Today went great till about 15mins ago. Oh no, another Zel story. YES ANOTHER ZEL STORY! AND THIS IS MY BLOG, SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, FUCK THE HELL OFF! Pardon my French but I'm distraught.  I'd always thought of us as something special. Incompetent I am not. I'm sure everyone else thinks they've got something special going on. What's obvious is obvious. Now, some of the normal people are having it better than I. We've become strangers. Mere acquaintances. I'm living with memories. Hi and bye on the street. I didn't want it to end like this. I didn't want it to end.  The more I think about it, the more of a fuck-up I believe I am. I did screw up big time, many times. She was perfect. I choose to believe that she is still faultless. I know nobody isn't. Nobody but her. Ramblings of a mind abused with tears. I would like to write it all down. I'm afraid that if I do, that would be my last art. I don't own much. There isn't much to give away.  I'm seriously considering my options.

      I've forgotten what I wanted to say. You know that feeling when you forget something that was just on the tip of your tongue or when you forget a dream and you want to get it back. It's frustrating. Cracked my knuckles and toes all at once. Still, they agitate me further.  Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. Songs are my life in more ways than one. I find solace in melody and the beach. On the waves and in the breeze. Zephyr.  I listened to Eunos play today. I watched the multitudes gather to hear this prodigy. I'm green. I don't like myself and I feel inadequate. I wish to study music theory and piano. Why am I vexed so easily? I love the boy, yet I feel competitive towards him. That's not right.  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.

      Didn't go to school today. First time in my life I'm actually skipping school with no valid reason. What scared me is that I don't care. But since I'm writing about it, do I still not care?  I'm listening to dream theatre now. It's different. Reminds me of X-Japan. Tragic story that X-Japan. The band version of Michael Jackson. Well... not really.  Watched Moulin Rouge yesterday. Realized that Bazz Luthman has his own style in film. It was reflected in Romeo and Juliet too. That's what makes him special. That's what makes him stand out from the other directors. What I don't understand, is why the film was so award winning. I wasn't really touched by it. Beauty, truth, freedom and most of all love. It's good.. love.  Her kiss was as velvet and silk are to skin. Love. It's a good thing, I think.

      Everyday seems like a lonely Valentine's to me. I should write a melancholic song. Do you wanna go to church tomorrow? Do you wanna be a rock star?  Her face is on my mind. It burns but I don't wanna take it off. She was my angel, now it's all done. If only everything would come to me in song. Life would be a harmony.  Time doesn't heal all wounds. She's going to Nepal. So much for not having time. I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me.  Never say never. My soul is empty. There's a God- shaped hole in all of us and in me there is one more for you.  happy valentine's day tim...

      If they can't live harmoniously, at least they ought to consider the notion of tolerance. BUT, boys and girls is tolerance sufficient?  Why does this plague me so. It's in me, on my mind, etched into my depths. If you're not part of te solution, you're part of the problem.  Henceforth, I will attempt to be part of the solution. Now the question is, which applies to all other resolutions in life, will I be able to sustain my attempt.  Pulled out of school today to go to the "JC open-houses". Intended to go jamming. Plans changed. Instead, I was out playing pool. Out with smart maats and minahs. Smart maats and minahs who teach me things about other maats and minahs. Today I learned that there are many different kinds of maats and minahs. They're like freaking species within a species within a species within a species. Amazing.

      Go placidly amongst the noise and haste,  and remember what peace there may be in silence.   That which is golden is full of deception. Quiet is solace. Then, silence is deafening.   It has the same effect on a man as it's opposite. Put a man in a quiet room for too long and he'll go mad. Put a man in a room with a constant beeeeeeeeeeee and he'll go mad too.   If God is a D.J. and life is a dance floor, was William who died on his birthday a fool when he said that life is a stage and we are actors? William predicted his death. So did Jesus.   My girlfriend's name is fate. Her hands are twisted.

      ... and just like that they were gone. I wrote an unfeeling letter- it was faintly amusing. I could have done better. I am an entertainer.  Apparently, Trinity College is affiliated to Melbourne Uni and is INFESTED with Singaporeans. Well at least she won't be alone. I gave her a long hug, my embrace was gentle and insincere. I felt it was though I tried. She told me that she'd miss me so much. It was nice to hear though my crowded mind. I knew they were hollow too. It's odd how we've heard it all before about treasuring people, but pay little heed after a sporadic overwhelming sense of meaning.  It's about saying the things I wish I'd said and doing the things I wish I'd done. What if? What then?  2) I've been asked on several occasions as to whom I intend to ask out on Valentines day. To the recurring enquiry, I reply with unease every single time, my heart's in the pocket of one who doesn't want it. I'm not sure if I want it back. Still, she beats the shit out of it every single day.  Why does it always rain on me?

      I feel like shit. I've been getting that a lot lately. I'm just so pissed off that I just looked away from the screen, blew out air and shook my head in dismay. How screwed is that!? I should kick myself in the ass. I'm disappointed. I contradicted myself time and time again. Blithering infidel! I'm swimming in a cold, dark, infinite ocean. Gong nowhere coz there's nowhere to go. I AM NOT A DRIFTER!  I'm lost today. Will probably be tomorrow. Even then, "Thy will be done" God, grant me the  Serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference.

      Interview in 9hrs... Pretty afraid though I know I shouldn't be. Grand plan: 1) Go in                   2) Say "Thy will be done"                   3) Just do it.  Just spent an hour on the phone with Hum. Crash course for current affairs. Hum's really smart. He's terribly funny too- in a vulgar sort of way... He cracks me up.  This is the stage they start to whack us with their questions. Although we're expected to know SOMETHING, I don't suppose they'll place heavy weightage on that particular aspect. What I THINK they ARE looking for, is the ability to pick ourselves up when we fall during the interview. It's like war.  I hope God will be my guide. Guide of my actions and tongue. I'm not sure if He'll help me. I mean it. I haven't been very good this week and I'm feeling afraid.  I'll wash my face, pray the serenity prayer and I'll go to sleep.

      Bonjour mon ami. I got home at about 12.30am. I remember now, why debates are not my cup of tea. Air is thick and competition frustrating. However, the prestige is there.  We went out and hung at a similar venue. We had a chat. It was fun. I want to be a doctor when I grow up, so that I can help all the sick people in the world. Childish babble through innocent lips. The world was much simpler then.  I'm more mature. I know lots more about love now. I knew most of it before, but it's clearer now. I still love her with all that I am. Even though it burns me. masochist. The good sort. Is there a good sort?  Desiree and Zel were in the closest proximity that they've ever been in. It was so damn Korean soap opera. Fate has a sick way of playing about with us.  Good night.

He sits on the white table with a skateboard on his lap. It's got coloured wheels and they're dizzy spinning. On base, "king of the jungle" is printed.  He just hangs there, his velvet curtains behind him. On her back, everywhere she goes. He knows everything. Secrets, woes, joys, lies, truths. She likes him and reality is neglected. I display pseudo-hatred for homer.  He was always the better being.  He did nothing, always in silence. Flick it if I could I would. Then reprimand came. Bitching fag mongrel. Tagging bastard.  He won. He hangs with his glory. Let him hence, he's with some of the best company there is. Defeat has been conceded to a toy dog.

      Greetings and salutations once again.  I have successfully added a tagboard. Was considering adding a skin to spice things us but that notion is currently pending.   Was thinking about it and I do admire William Hung. You know, the "She bangs" boy from American Idol 3. He wasn't the best and the laughed at him but he was so pure. He stated his desire- which was to make music his career despite the fact that he was doing civil engineering in the Uni there; and was willing to at the very minimum, try for it. At the very end, after his "gig" in which his bootie was going a fair bit of gigging itself, he simply said, "I've tried my best and I have no regrets at all". I want to be like Mr. William Hung, except, with the ability. I'm cowardly. Life on the whole is daunting.   Desiree has a good vocabulary. I should get a book of Desiree words to use for G.P.   Slowly getting the hang of simple fill-in's. You know, now that I think of it, about not thinking that much. Have been asked to sing for a gig in PJC. Bunch of smart maats- how could I resist.   Dilemmas. I need work on my spelling. It hasn't been too good of late.  Have to do Chem now. It's late. Need a miracle.

      Learning how to do fill in's. I am having doubts about my ability. Leon came by today, everybody loves Leon. Popularity makes me jealous sometimes. Well, not to the severity of jealousy. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife.  What if she was justified? What if I really was a jerk. She could be trying to absolve herself of hurt, anger, frustration. I choose again, to believe that I'm to blame. If there's one purity, I choose to believe that it's her. I'm an asshole.  Had very weird dreams last night. Dreamt that I killed Gareth with a spade like object. A sharp one. BUT HE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME FIRST! Sumpah! Then I tried junking the body in a big drain, but not before 2 women showed up at the top of the overhead bridge. One gasped and the other took a photo. What I don't get, is why Gareth? Weird.  It's 10.47. Have been mucking about all day. Just found out that I've got homework due tomorrow. A lot of it. She's always on my mind. I miss her telling me "I love you". I felt it every single time she said it. I miss her so. She hates me.  Later.

       I'm not sure if she looked at it before. Today she did. She said it was beautiful. I gave it to her 353 days ago at 6.55 in the morning, in a nike shoe box. "ZEL" was on the cover, bold, in  thick black marker. The interior was covered in cotton wool, stuck on with glue. There was red and gold fine glitter sprinkles too. Diagonally, I placed a single red rose. It was fresh and damp. It was alive. The silver chain was wound round the stalk and the crystal was in the rose.   I still remember what she said. I didn't expect it. I had hoped for better. A hug perhaps? She didn't have to say anything. It wasn't necessary. She could have looked me in the eye. That would have been nice. Never the less, I got an "OH! COOL!".    She told me that she hid it in betwen some clothes. If I recall correctly. And that her mom found it and asked her where the pretty necklace came from. She lied- said it was old and that she'd forgotten who'd given it to her. Maybe this was the kind of lie that she got tired of telling. The details of the red rose were falsified too. Apparently the boys in her class gave roses to all the girls. They must have been pretty rich to buy so many roses on valentines day.  As for the box? The one which I spent slightly more than 2 hours on, sticking, blow-drying with my mom's hair dryer and sprinkling glitter into. That one she couldn't keep. It was chucked in my class bin. She didn't really look at it.  The boys played after class. Leon, Jed, Dan Ngui, Cheam, Squirt, Sze Yuan, Joel and I. I can't remember if there was anyone else. We tore out the cotton wool and threw it about. Rubbed it onto each other's backs and and navy blue pants. It really stuck. Helluva clean up job after that. Wow, the human memory is a remarkable thing.  It all became worth it today. She messaged me, which she never did, even when we were one, and said "I was looking at the necklace you gave me. It's beautiful".  I am happy.

      Don't feel like doing my homework. Don't feel like eating. Don't feel like laughing. Don't feel like going to school. Don't feel like there should be tomorrow. Don't feel like there should've been today.  Feel unclean. Feel useless. Feel heartless. Feel manipulative. Feel empty. Feel broken. Feel torn. Feel burnt. Feel tears.  Am saddened. Am used. Am melancholic. Am depressed. Am rejected. Am hated. Am withdrawn. Am hoping.

      Hello. Had ACJC choir sectionals today. ACJC choir will be doing the NDP songs for this year. There'll also be a concert come the end of May.   Went back to FMSS momentarily after that. Spoke with Joe for a while and we sang sentimental songs while Chris tried to play the piano. Somewhere out there, Right here waiting for you. If we hold on together...  While I was walking out of school, Eugenia told me that Zel was in class. I smiled in denial and quietly walked off. Till now, I wonder if she was in class.  I love this girl. I'm grown up now and I think I should know the difference between love and infatuation.  It's odd today coz smallville seemed to be speaking to me. Lana always reminded me of her. I know not why. 'Neway, she and Clark got into some riff coz she wanted to date someone else and he got jealous... And she was like, "Look, we're not together anymore, so deal with it". My life is indeed a stage.  I had to delete all my items from my old phone today. Came across a folder in my message section called "Heart". Inside were all the messages that  Zel sent me, that really mattered. The ones that I'd look to on a blue day. I ached deeply when I read the messages and deleted them one by one. She was my angel.  Wake up Tim.

      You need not know how I know or what I know. I just hurt so much I don't even know where it comes from. I do yet I choose not to. When you're feeling hurt, your chest kinda hurts. That's why they call it heartache.  It's hit me a few times before, but tonight's was different. I was confused and shocked at the same time too. She's found someone new. Any lover knows that to love is to let go. I musn't be any lover then. My heart aches and I write.   The Jumper   Voices from afar beckon Loneliness&#8217; paled pain to come back to earth. Coincidentally, desperation&#8217;s only intention sequels being perched precariously amidst the clouds.  The moonlight burns, zephyr&#8217;s too harsh. Confusion decides not. Chaos knows not when, how, what or why.  Colours in disarray, distress gazes down. Weakness the Cyclops looks only back. Pessimism tenders no leeway for brighter days.  Hopelessness is northward of ants who scurry 67 floors below. He quits; just to think of her once more. Eyes shut, warm. Cold.  The last leaf of fall. Humpty dumpty sat on the wall. Every tear&#8217;s natural course.   Goodnight. Let it be good. Jesus heal my heart.

      Went to the gym. I will do it. Here's a poem. Please do mail you comments to  Jackel83@hotmail.com . PPLLEEAASSEEEEE! I'll add chocolate sprinkles if you do. hehe? If this works out, I'll start a separate blog for my writing and poems.   Old gone days   There is not much of a sadder thing than the ramblings of a poet who&#8217;s lost everything.  Lamentations of days gone past; long past. Regret is the black tide. Wash over me, me over.  Damn naivety. 'Twas for the goal; for the gold. The prize was price paid for ignorance.  Time was opposition. Procrastination, my ally. Overly conquered foe. Too much of a friend.  After all, I am faced with resolve.

      FMSS team lost to the NJC juniors team in our final match yesterday. I felt bad coz it would have been a bad way to end your core CCA's career. Especially if you're the president. Poor girl.  She was cold over dinner and even let out a "YEAH RIGHT" when the topic of boys treating girls well came up.. Miss Luah and I spoke on the way home and she told me that if I felt she was the one, I should wait. WHICH, dear reader, I've already concluded.  I've left FISH (My Sunday school class). Am not especially close to anyone there anymore, and hence, I'm not under any obligation to stay. Not growing there.  Desiree tells me to move on though optimism may be nice, coz it'll only last for so long. She questions its possible "one-sidedness". I think, while my love may be unrequited, that's how it is in fairytales too. I will wait coz I think she's the one. Which in itself is questionable coz I haven't dated anyone else yet. She is the one person I look forward to meeting every night online. I shan't say more lest you think I'm falling in love with you love.   Reader, reader, reader, you must be getting tired of my love and thoughts about Zel. Too Damn Bad. It's MY blog and I'll bloody white what I wish, Nevertheless, I think it's time I started something fresh. So keep checking for new and exciting updates which will engage you more (I hope).  P.S. My daily blogging schedule will probablly be hampered by my new routine. I get tired easily now. ACJC is not a forgiving place. Goodnight.

      Happy is the man who sees (his world) and sad is he who does not, yet He who does not should be happy.  ACJC is not getting any better.  Poetry is not worthy of this stage yet.  I want to talk about yesterday. Yesterday, I went for debate training to help with what little I could. Zel was there and we didn't talk at all. I got sad again. Went to conference with Angeline at West Mall after doing the proposition's case up nicely on the white board. She was busy and her boss was due soon, so I left without saying much, with her beckoning me to return, I walked out.  Took a 173 up to Zel's hill and walked up in a drizzle. Halfway up, it began to rain, as in really rain, but I still walked up the hill. Why the hell right? I reached her house and stood across the road under a tree, drenched and dazed for 10 minutes. Not like the tree helped much, but I did it on impulse anyway. The leaves were in my hair. It was young. We were young; are young. Reminisce.  10 minutes I stood there blank. Looked down to get water out of my hair and her father was in the doorway staring at me when I looked up. I walked casually off and sweared casually as I turned the corner at the hill's inflexion junction. I walked down slowly, dripping, but feeling less burdened than before.  I am burdened again. I want her back but I can't. It's not the right time. I did it with a reason. Till then,   Good things come to those who wait.

      ACJC will require some getting used to. The PE teachers cannot deal with BIG numbers like 1, 2 and the BIGGEST OF ALL,  3 . Other teachers are almost blind. As in literally, there are abnormalities in their ability to see. P.E. teachers sleep with other P.E. teacher's wives and every member of the faculty is required to pronounce their words well with fastidious articulation. Sticky and irritating.  My peers are cold and detached. I hope there is a drastic turn-around in the way things are going. Indian boy's community requested my presence with them. I cordially declined after embarrassing their leader.  I still think of Hazel a lot. Tomorrow will be abstract/ love poetry day. I will write poems during my breaks and post them here. Tomorrow should be interesting. I would like practical criticism, so you can mail me at  jackel83@hotmail.com  or just tag me. Especially Desiree and Leon. I would like to discover for my self, how I measure up to your standards.  Good night friends, I love you all. Really I do.

      I sat on the bus after Brakefluid's recording. It was raining and there were droplets on the outside of the window. Outside in the cold, the world went by slow. I caught the blur.  I have doubts about my ability now. There are plenty of people better. Why should I make it. Dammit. I'll live with my dream and the belief that good things come to those who wait.  Kept thinking of her. Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head. Damn good song. Damn EMO now. 182 isn't all bad friends.  Tomorrow is the first day. I hope I like it in ACJC. I hope it'll last forever.  God Make me clean.

      I am tired now. I still hurt from gymming the other day. Got posted to ACJC today. Not thrilled about it though. Don't know why. Religion is a simple thing made complex by us. Bottom line is faith. Asked Eric plenty of questions about his lesson today. Either he can't answer me or I can't understand him. Either way, it's not working out.  Listened to a damn good example of false teachings today. Appalling.  Jaryl told me that someone would be pissed if I joined AC choir. I asked who and he said Joshua. That waterpolo come choir boy convert not happy that I'm joining the Choir? I'm the one who shouldn't be pleased. I haven't been in contact with him for over 3 yrs now and he still makes racist comments against me. I feel like using an expletive. I left my old class because of him and his immaturity. Apparently, some have disabilities growing up. Well, I'm a stronger person now. Can out-talk the mongrel anyday. I hear anything and he'll know about it. So will everyone else. Not even in the damn college and have enemies in it already. How lucky.  Goodnight. Love you.  I miss Zel still.

      Sitting at my desk with an Aria in my arms and a throbbing in my temples. I've reduced the screen's glare, but it isn't helping.  I'm thankful for good friends who stand up for you. Relationships like those take time, feelings and emotions. Don't leave them on the shelves.  I went to the esplanade on Thursday night. Missed Vertical Rush due to a mis comm. None the less, I did get a listen to a few other bands. The trip wasn't in vain coz I sent quality time with my best man and gained experience and exposure in terms of music on the whole and genres. One band stuck out. "Cesspit", an interesting cocktail. A Singaporean mix of Caribbean jive and funk groove. They had more than half the crowd dancing to their damn tasty rojak. Couple damn good P.R. with trumpets trombones a damn good bassist and drummer and you've got THE WORKS! Maat bands rock coz I like PuNK r0cK gANgStA~! Haha.  There was a female lead guitarist for "March 12th". I was like wow! and thought to myself, damn, if Des is this good, I'll marry her! Haha! I'm hoping against all odds that negative repercussions don't entail this...  As we were leaving, some girl recognized me... but I couldn't remember her name and I didn't ask. Leon told me that she mumbled something about CAP though. Damn... Can't forget. Problem!  Oracion is falling apart slowly but surely. Damn.  Went to the beach with a third 04S12 on yesterday and had a good time. I like the beaches at Sentosa. Memories. Will probably never see them again. Upsetting.  I am now a man of many sorrows after reflection. Being soft sucks but is nice, coz I know I'm exceptional. I love you. Good night.

      Hi. Went out with F.I.S.H. to east coast beach today. Good time with the boys. Piling and all.  I sat there alone, wrote her name in the sand beside me to my left and spoke to her in an audible voice. The first word I said was "Zel" and I felt... different. I've always wanted to go to the beach with her, and she's always been too busy. Always.  Steph Yap's changed a lot. She's a know it all now. My theory is as such. People in SRJC generally aren't as competent as those in FMSS. As such, the opportunity for her to take control there is prevalent. What pisses me off is when she tries doing that with FISH. Wake up lah. She was everywhere. "I'll only help you start the fire, but I wont cook coz I'm wearing contacts." Please lah! Starting it involves more smoke. But of course she knew that already since she's the authority on such matters. You know something, this is not worth it.  I wanna be motivated. Started gymming today. Happy with that. Yong's a bro. I wanna stick up on my wall "You WILL be there! Make it soon!" I wanna judge the standard of Singaporean competition before I enter Idol. What I'm afraid is that Singapore Idol will trigger an unprecedented increase in the general masses interest in improving vocal technique. To put it simply. I'm not sure if I can handle more competition.  Encourage me.

      Good evening... morning actually.  I haven't started my music OR exercise thing yet... Will do so tomorrow. Am going to the gym with Yong at 10 at Chinese garden. This will be serious.  As to the Zel issue, I figure, "good things come to those who wait". It hurts when I think of the fun we had. It's not my fault. Just read an email that Jiu Rong sent me. "Everything a guy should do for a girl" I read it and got everything checked on the list. I did it all for her. Even the lying down under the stars with her head on my chest. Everything. I miss her so much.   Oh shit, I'm crying.  Went to see runaway jury today with Shawn Goh( Bukit Batok sec sch ex head prefect NJC) and Audrey Chua (RJC). No special effects or high speed car chases, but a damn good thinker.  Here's a special thanks to Jiu Rong for making me smile whenever we meet wherever we meet. She's pretty and wise. Today she told me that I shouldn't hold on to a beautiful memory so tightly till it hurts. How true.

      I was sixteen, turned seventeen, I know that I'm naive... We celebrated the occasion the day before. Mango cake. Family was there... well, everyone except Daddy that is. He left early. Whatever.  Mummy, Pati, Tata, Mama and auntie Violet all chipped in to get me an N-GAGE. It's neat, but it's very difficult to SMS with.... I got $170 in addition to that. Gave $20 to offering today. God says we should give at least 10% of what we have. It's an obligation, so why is it called an offering?  Shajahan would be celebrating his birthday today too. Pity he died. Somebody's thinking of you dude...  I made a wish before I blew out the candles. That some form of reparation would come for me and Zel. Maybe birthday wished are only valid for BIRTHDAYS and not the night before. I was hoping for a call from her today. I got an SMS at 815pm that said "Hey, happy birthday". Well, it's better than nothing. Who am I trying to kid?  I dreamt of her again 2 nights ago. I cant remember where we were but I do remember that she stuck out her hand, the way she always did and wanted me to hold it. I did and she rubbed my had. I was happy. Happier than I've been in weeks. I live a sad life now, you know that when your dreams bring you joy.  I will try to start again. Kick my old ways and embrace what I will of myself. At the end of this year, I aim to be pleased at my evaluation. As for my evaluation of my 16th year, I am pleased. God was good to me this year.   I'll miss sweet sixteen.

      I thought of many things to write in my blog today. Local music, my inspiration for songs, friends I'm grateful for... I wish I wouldn't think so much. I wish I was normal. Well, no I don't. I'm happy thinking, it just that sometimes...  Daena, Shi Hui and Amanda gave me a neat cylindrical box today. Cookies and bright pink ankle socks. A nail file and a neat card came along with it too.. Sweet.  Went to check out Lufi's band. syawla evol they're called. Good stuff, tight and all, but I see to much Sean Paul and Linkin Park influence in them. Also, there's no salient structure to most of their songs and the tunes aren't exceptional or clear. Too much happening at a go. They all switch instruments throughout the gig and even brought in a sax for a solo. Highly impressive. I feel there was too much of a blues, swing and jazzy feel to the music. Waaaay to much instrumental too. That doesn't cut it for Singaporean audiences. I could critique till the cows don't wanna come home, but the question remains, could I do better.  I ought to find a way to make this an interactive blog so that my readers can interactive.... (Duh Tim... that's why it's called an INTERACTIVE blog)... eeehehe..  Till tomorrow friends.

      Hello. Went out with Astro today. Pool and gaming. Blew a sum of money. Damn. School's going to end soon and I'll miss my PJC pals dearly. Man! What a drag. Sentimental fool. I've told 'em that I'll come back every now and then to see how things are. They agreed softly.  I've been through this many times before. Creative Arts Program '02, Choral Festival "02, Fairfield, Etphore, 2C, U.W.C.... the list goes on. This is similar, yet different due to the simple fact that either the other instances were friendships forged over a week at most, or friends I still keep in touch with. With Pioneer, it'll be different coz I spent 3 months with these people and now I have to start again.  Damn, another hurdle.

      A lot of things to write about tonight... It might be lengthy but I can assure you that it might be entertaining. Well of course, that all depends on your state of mind. You know... I was just thinking, tag me so that I know you were here. Yeah... I'd feel slightly more appreciated.  I'm glad to know Desiree. I've got her to thank for my mood picking up. It's not T-shirt weather just yet for me both literally and metaphysically, I've still got issues to deal with. But! I'm getting better. Happy songs are nice.  I've decided to better myself as part of my "Tim's gonna get good" plan. I just typed in "Tim's gonna get up" but deleted it coz it was... err.. hehe... OK! STOP SMILING ALREADY! DIRTY PEOPLE... HMPH! So anyway, as part of my plan, it'll be a one day body one day music thing. My mark for physique is none other than  El Royale   Mr Leon Oei . Oh man!! When I bold his name, HTML puts "strong" beside his name! hahahah!!!! Yes ladies, Leon's a hot bod... You gotta see it to believe it. As for musicality, my benchmark, who else but  Foong .  I got a SMS from Nepal 2 days ago. Seng regrettedly informed me that Zel tore her ankle while they were hiking to a primary school because she tripped on a log and her weighty pack bag pulled her down, thus resulting in catastrophic injury. That went all wrong, but you get what I mean... So I was hell worried and panicked and all like the wuss I am called her mother, who by the way HATES me, to inform her. Obviously she got worried too and requested that I tell them to inform her directly... Wow! I called her mom... 45 minutes later I got a call telling me that it was a prank. Apparently she was talking to Seng and dared him to find out what I would be like if he told me that she'd injured herself. Hurah! Well, I'm glad she sill knows I love her enough to DIE by calling her mum. We cleared things up with her mom...  I'm pissed with Chris and Sarah for not sticking up for me at the Sec 2 camp. Cost me 2 good days of fun. Damn... Shan't elaborate.  Spoke to Aziz, Sufian and Hazwan today about Islam. I'm  SHOCKED  by the parallels that can be drawn with Christianity. Now I question, Which Faith is a real faith and which is the blind faith.  There's more, but IF You've read up till here, Thank you. It means something special to me.

      Hello. I skipped school today. This is starting to worry me. I shan't bother bout WRITING today.  Went to foong's yesterday. He's a prodigy. Nothing less. Might be staying over at FMSS tonight. We'll see.  Slept till 1pm today. A very nice tune popped into my head at about 9am but I put it off and said I'd remember it when I woke up. I feel like shit coz I cant remember it. Screw laziness... All I can remember was that it was only worth 2 lines and it had something to do with a "she" and talking to or turning to our friends.  On another note, I'm still in love with hazel. It's been 4 months since we broke up and I still dream of her. Last night she was with me, We were in school and she was close. I felt warm and happy and strange. I turned around and kissed her on her head. I knew it wasn't real, yet I wanted it to be, so much so that I believed it. You don't understand?  She would.

      She rose to applause and cheer with bubbly. She was good and knew it. She spoke with speed and a tinge of humor which unintendedly failed. The team used both catch phrases twice. Gone with a capital G. Not so sticky accents and "are's" in place of "is's" are a bad combination however heart warming it may be.  They were fluent, fastidious and precise. Real killer queens. I feel good to have put my finger on it. To the point like an arrow shredded by another. Confident and demure simultaneously. The meek are strangely strong. They deserved what they got and we knew it.  I am still irked by my apparently inability to accept the way I am. I wish my constant pursuit to hone my various abilities would end. Then again, it's a good thing- wanting to become better, to improve, to be increasingly proficient. So much for serenity.  Time heals not; all wounds.

      Hello. Still sad. Have friends though. Skipped class a lot. Played pool today. Got thrashed by Shyama, but luck was really on her side today.  Got inspiration for a song. A tune simply popped into my head after talking to Sunshine Sarah. But the tune's happy and the song's 'bout the world spitting on your face. Juxtaposition. Oxymoron.  Enjoy random lyrics.  I'm in the sky tonight There I can keep by your side Watching the wide world ride and hide now I'll be coming home next year.  Into the sun we climb Climbing our wings will burn white Everyone's strapped in tight we'll ride it out. I'll be coming home next year.

      Went to Rayner's place last night. It's HUGE! Took his dad's car out for a joy ride at about 2am and we did like 160km/h. That didn't make me happy. Have been listening to blink a lot lately. It used to help, but now it's just another futile attempt at making myself feel better.  Shyama told me today the names of the top 10 who have been selected. End of the line Tim. Worthlessness has more value than what I perceive of myself right now. 24 of us in round two, 10 of them in round 3. I'd thought to myself that if I were to make it to top ten, whether or not I got the scholarship would not be important anymore, because by then, I'd have proven my own worth to the only person I needed to prove it to. Myself.  What really hurts is that the people to whom I am especially close to within the circle of 24 got selected for the top 10. Jolyn, Sharmini, Shyama, Leon and Shawn. DAMMIT!! WHY WASN'T I WORTH IT!?  This entity- Life- is not a kind soul. One mistake and it kicks you in the ass. I wish I could hit rewind. I want to change it. I have to change it. I CANNOT be just another person, who comes, lives and dies. That is not what I'm meant to be. Don't think I'm righteous, blame your own lack of vision.  Worst part is that I might loose some of my closest friends when it's all done. I don't mean to be selfish, but...  Somebody help me. I'm due to crash and burn.

      Stayed over at Rayner's last night. Took his dad's car out for a joy ride. 160km/h. That didn't make me happy. I've been listning to bkink alot lately, that's not helping either. It used to, but now it's just a futal attempt to make myself feel better.  Shyama told me today that the 10 have been selected. That means the end of the line Tim. Worthlessness itself has more value than what I percieve myself to be at this instant. 24 of us were in round two and only 10 got choosen for round 3. I thought to myself, if i got to round 3, it wouldn't matter if I got it anymore because by then I would have prooved to myself my worth. What really hurts is that ALL the people in the scholarship to whom I was colse with got selected for the third round. Jolyn, Sahrmini, Leon, Shyama, Shawn. Dammit! Why was I not worth it?!   This entity - Life - is not a kind soul. ONE mistake and it kicks you in the ass! I wish i could hit rewind. I want to change it. The worst part of having my close friends selected is that there is a very high chance that I might loose some of them. Somebody help me please. It's pent up and I'm going to crash and burn soon.

      We have a lot to learn and our age is inconsequential. I need to learn how to forget. Not forget past incidents... I'm good at that. The type of forgetting I need to learn is forgetting hurt and disappointment. It kills me slowly from inside, eating at what I am.  Oracion needs to learn how not to be whores for gigs. We can't jump at every gig that comes our way... Otherwise we'd have a song written about us. Humor part 2. Leon, you get that one? Haha. It's a matter of choosing our gigs wisely. To be a rockstar, you damn well behave like one. Not behaving like Arthur adorned with many heavy ornaments around neck, and wrist, decked in leather and chained boots which clink with the individual step. Donned thou shalst be in thy own persona.   And on a slightly more random note, people in general have to wake up, be original, not follow trends BLINDLY and learn tact. The list simply goes on.  I hope it's true what they say, when one door closes, another will open. I'll have to look for my reasons and doors. Mind your P's and Q's.

      Tonight, I realized I'm not worth it. That I've been living in a dream. The fact that I've got nobody to share my despair with at 1 in the morning just goes to show that I'm a blank. The only constancy in life is inconstancy. Just when I thought that I had things going my way, it hits me.  Why do I have to talk to God? Why can't he talk to me? Why were the people who I am close to get the third call for the scholarship and why wasn't I included. Why did I say what I said that day. Why am I questioning this even though I said thy will be done in my life? WHY DO I FEEL LIKE SCREAMING AND CRYING AND BREAKING AND TEARING NOW?  That's it. I'm broken. I'm beaten. Again, just when I was recovering from Zel, life is like a box of chocolates aint it. You never know what you gonna get.  I've failed myself again. Wake the fuck up Tim.

      The young prince then decided. Or at least he thought he decided, because his decision was made in reluctance. He was a coward and easily hurt. The young prince had withdrawn again after a long while, his temporary confidence gone, like Samsons' long hair. He reasoned to himself that they just needed good friends. He wasn't going to do anything about his emotions, except bottle them up and let the gas out.  Have told the choir teachers that I was leaving and they agreed with a frighteningly synchronized nod. Will go for drama auditions soon and with that, we'll see what becomes of me from there..  Feel like sobbing, but now that I've said that, won't anymore. Ahh.. Just told Des that I didn't want to be like a normal boy but was behaving like one. PSHAW! Sod it!

      Once upon a time, there was a prince who met a princess who was already attached. The prince was captured by her beauty. The prince was sad when he discovered her attachment to the noble. The prince vowed to get the princess and she soon fell in love with him, his heart and his mind. They lived immaculate lives and loved each other with respect and whole hearted passion. One day, an evil witch lady popped by the castle and told the prince that he had to leave, or live - with her blood on his hands. Fearing for his first loves' life, he left, that no harm be done to her.  Years passed and the young prince loved her with all of his being still. To her, he had written an innumerable number of letters explaining his departure. The princess either didn't get the letters or didn't get the message. Either way, she hated the young prince. One time, he had  braved the dark woods stealthily, to see how she was doing. He called up to her in her tall tower. That's where she deserved to be- high up above him. She looked out and down at him from her window and killed almost all of his love for her with her words of scorching fire. The distraught prince sought the council of his wisest men, who advised that he move on as his doting was doing him more harm than good. The prince was reluctant and undecided.  Before the sun rose one day, just as the sky was warming to pink, the prince was riding his horse by the countryside. His tears augmented the fresh morning dew as memories of his princess danced in his head. Just then in the middle of the field, he saw a beautiful maiden. She was special, and she too added to the morning dew her tears. He spoke to her and felt her pain. They had a similar disease. Both longed for love lost due to unfortunate action or circumstance. The young prince fell in love with the beautiful maiden.  The young prince was timid, and the beautiful maiden pined with him every passing day, over her lost love. The young prince had not had sufficient courage to proclaim his love to the hurting maiden in fear of tearing her more and being rejected. The young prince became very sad and longed for ample opportunity and courage. He couldn't eat or sleep with ease. Her name was on his mind. The silly young prince.

      I look at them and their proficiency. One says misogynist and the other quintessential. Feel green and wish more of myself. Do I try excessively to emulate something that I'm incapable of? That I'm not? I'm talking about my writing. I'm not going to go on leaving you in a lurch, attempting to decipher a coded message like other writers do, coz it's "stylistic" and "impressive". Pseudo-Shat my man, pseudo-shat!  backlogged assignments tug gently. You know, like something that persists, but doesn't affect you. They will soon. That's life, the way things are, it's a cycle, and wheels of such have to come full-circle.  There's a lot on my mind, about life, love and music. My passions, I pray remain with me. I'm listening to Killer Queen by Queen. That's music. I love it.! I LOVE IT!!!  Dawn will be on TV tomorrow. Friends. I got a little (pretty large) gift for Leon. He's bound to like it.  Smallville is on. Weird thing to say after intellectual jargon. Shut up.  I love you.

      Good evening. I'm pretty tired. Just back from alumni meeting. Saw Sarah and was happy. She's got a pretty smile.  Saw Leon in school. Everyone hears what you say, friends listen to what you have to say but best friends hear what you don't say. I love Leon.  Have an economics test tomorrow. Am extremely frightened. Am very stressed with homework stockpile.  Have been feeling distant from Hazels' memory recently? Could I be moving on? Is it time? If it is, why is it? I'd wanted to be special, to be un-ordinary, to stay with my first love. Not to be? I can't find it in myself to accept that. We shared many special things. I'm disappointed when I think of how hostile she is.  Sat with Dawn and Joel after school. Dawn had cool hair today. It's coming back again. Rejection. The fear I grapple with. Will see if we meet tomorrow. Friends.  Good night.

      It's Sunday morning. 1.10 to be precise. I've just finished my GP second draft which was due 2 days ago. Will loose 1 mark in the overall grade for my tardiness. Have to do the literature essay which is a week overdue by today. Also, 33 pages of the economics t.y.s. After that, in order of priority for homework, is a tamil essay about formal education vs vocational training which is due tomorrow, followed by a human geog essay on migration. And to top it all off, I've got an economics test on theory of demand, supply, elasticity and cross elasticity of demand and supply and goodness knows what else AS WELL AS a human geog test on a lot of stuff that I never understood to begin with!  Haha! Welcome to my world... again. And what am I doing? Writing my blog... that's what.. duphus. Have spoken to the authorities with whom I need to  clear up various issues. Sorry, can't mention names or anything implicative. But of course, I can't stop you from thinking can I? Sometimes I feel contemptuous, like 20 seconds ago, and then now, I reel remorseful for my emotional state 20 seconds ago. Damn... Oh, btw, I'm thinking of going to drama, where I'd be able to utilize and improve my dramatic ability. I've already got the Fairfield choir alumni, so there's where I get my vocal upkeep from. So in the end, I'm improving in tandem rather than an unbalanced crescendo in my aesthetic ability. Will ponder further.  I want to bring Dawn back to church. It's time I woke my ideas up and worked along the lines of the great commission. Chilled with her after cycling till 1120 Friday night. We talked about things and things. She's brave. Not really frightened or spooked by things in general. I sure am. She's just a friend.  Will finish talking to Hitomi and then get to work. Please pray for me, dear reader, that I can handle things and not crack.  Still miss Hazel. It's been 4 months and 29 days. I'm beginning to doubt if I should wait, and if it's worth the wait.  Hold thy desperate hand! Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art, yet thy tears are womanish and thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast.

      Hello. I'm tired but have to do my work. Anonymous sounds like Sunand Razu... that indian. Haha!  Just spoke to kai wei. His msn pic is of Po Huat doing "something" to barney. What the HELL did barney do to you guys... Haiz.... WEIRD INCLINATIONS YOU ALL HAVE....  Got Dawn's email add. Am happy.  Am sad. I miss Zel. I'm a lot like this dude I'm reading about. His name's Othello and I think the only difference between him and me is that he's got a chick and I don't. But that's not the point. Haiz... I think about the good things we did together and the bad things that I did most of the time, and I still think the good outweighs the bad by tonnes, but she begs to differ. Says I cause her suffering. Ouch... Sigh again.   Back to square one with more homework.  Ceteris Paribus

      I'm quite new, and I want to change, yet within me resides the underlying fear that I'd change and loose what I am now.  I've realized that I have issues to deal with. Pride comes before a fall and I've fallen and I don't intend to fall anymore. I'm not going to quit or run or whatever you wanna call it. I'm going to become closer to my Lord and He will guide me in his light coz I've decided that that's the way I want to live my life.  I'm going to have to loose my pride, or simply retain less of what I have now because it simply won't do me any good. It was my pride that caused me to defend myself against what Keith said, it was my pride that made me stay in the LT, it was my pride that picked me up to take him down, it was my pride which questioned him outside the LT and it was my pride that told the teacher that we'd go to the office. There was nothing wrong in going to the office, but the tone in which I did it was erroneous. You think I'm being too harsh and picky? Yes and No. But I want to change, so this is how it'll have to be. Let it not be said not understood that ACJC tore me down, but let it be known that ACJC made me stronger. Yes, a stronger man.  As for what happened with Mrs Wilson, I have chosen to take a lower standpoint though I still feel that injustice was done. This is how I'm going to see it. I shouldn't have written about the school like that, because if I want to be a leader in the school, I'm going to have to love it. And if I'm going to represent the country with the school, I'm going to have to love my country. I watched my tone and the way I spoke to her and am pleased at how I carried myself. Didn't burst or anything.  I'm going to fight to turn this around. People are going to see me loving and they'll think, wasn't that the Timothy that was prideful? I'm going to let Jesus's light and love shine in me. And I'm going to fight to turn impressions around. I need to lah, coz if I don't I won't have much of a chance at leadership anymore. I don't believe that there is anything wrong in expressing my ambition but I do believe that I have to have the right intentions. My intention, in all honesty was not for power or popularity, but to prove that Fairsians could do it too. And I've always known that leadership was servanthood. Pride clouded that for a while but that's being blown away now. You'll see, just you wait. And even if I don't make it, I'll shine for Jesus no matter what. (After a long period of being very moody and all)  I have decided to remain in ACJC for several reasons. 1) I'm going to face and tackle my problem head on by tackling myself. 2) I'm going to be able to benefit from one of the best arts streams around. 3) I'm going to learn alot from one of the best choirs around. 4) I'm going to experience what the real world is like and how to deal with difficult people, which also means learning to deal with the way I handle people. 5) I have got a few good friends with whom I can really relate to without the fear of being looked at differently.  I miss talking to Leon and Desiree. Must admit that I was disappointed at some of the reasons that muscles gave to me stay, but that's gone, he's got emotions too. Granted. I still love him. Good man he is. Really admire the way he handles things sometimes.  Walked Dawn home today. We talked about lots of things, about favorite places and walking on roof-tops. About children and dogs and lots more that's between the both of us. She's nice and all and faces almost similar problems as I. She even lives on a hill near me with a little park nearby. Sound familiar? Oddly so, but I pray that you, reading this, get no interpretation that swings wildly in your imagination. She may be wildly intellectual and pretty, but she's also a friend.  It's getting lengthy and I have a LOT of homework to do. Good night. Starting again.

      Hello. Hope you're doing well. I just sent an Email to my princess. Hope I wasn't too straightforward. Naah... She's a strong girl. Sometimes/most of the time/ all of the time, too strong.  I went for dinner last night with mummy, daddy and mama. We went to this Turkish restaurant where the service was rubbish. I couldn't enjoy my food either coz I was to yolked.  ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************ ************************************************************  I don't want to think any more.  I'm glad that I've got pati. She prayed with me over the phone about the little problem I'm facing now. I love her soooo sooo much. I remember I used to cry when I thought about her "leaving". I'm very frightened. I don't wanna loose pati.  I'd be really sad if anything happened to Zel's grandma too. Zel loves her a lot and yah, I wouldn't wanna imagine.  Ne'way, I'm going to meet Jireh at 4.20 and then go for Choir at 7. Will send Sarah home after that coz I dun' like the thought of her walking alone at night. Yah... well... will re entry later. Ciao

      I am happy today. I woke up thinking about what happened yesterday and I figured, that it had to be one of those things. The kind of thing where you JUST DO IT and not look back from there.  Today I scored full marks for my boat license theory test. Then, I spent the rest of the day at IMM with the bands. Oracion was so so but Jireh's was excellent. At least Crimson tide was good. Tight like nobody's business! Today really made me feel a lot better. After all the shit that's been happening.  ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************** I walked out of the school almost in tears. Called Madam Ang and told her that I needed to go back to PJ. She arranged it for me and I was asked to make my way down. I explained my predicament to the principal and vice principal of PJ and they were willing to help me. Now what I have to do is get transferred from ACJC to PJC and it'll be set. I'll start again.  Leaving a lot of a great dream behind. You will never know what it feels like till you have an encounter of the first kind. Its hard to describe. I'm reluctant to leave it behind, but I know it's something I have to do now. My chances for leadership there are all but gone. Black marked in a prestigious institution. Man, that sucks man. Should I stay and fight? Is leadership everything? Is it true that the standards of education in ACJC are higher? Or is it up to the individual to determine his own destiny? Leading the AC choir would have been nice, but leading the PJ choir would definitely pose a much greater challenge. And that's what I wanted in the first place, so yeah. Do I really want to be on the same stage as the Pioneer choir? Would it be embarrassing? Will I finish my A levels with a great opportunity cost? These friend are a mere fraction of all the shit in my head now. Haha... Yet I can still find humor in that.  The Best Is Yet To Be.

      Today has to be one of the worst days of my life. I cant talk now. I'm ill and have a sore throat. I cried a lot today. I wanted Zel, but wanting is all I can do now. The situation in ACJC has become irreparable. I will elaborate further in my next entry. Just know this dear reader, that my life is almost at rock bottom.

      Hello. Got 1 demerit point today for yesterday's fight. Was very very pissed but Fairfield made it all better. It wasn't fair that I got the point too since even they admitted that I was the victim. I'll tell you one thing. It all hit me when I was mad. Sometimes, when you're mad, it all becomes very clear.  My sole rebuttal to the assailant was for him to cut out his egoistic ways. This would have been the equivilant of requesting him to shut up. Other than that, no other fault was mine. So why demerit victims? At the very worse, it was a judgment (I prefer to call it advice) on his behaviour which he was unable to accept. I have learnt a few things. Here are some of my thoughts.  ************************************************************* ************************************************************* ************************************************************* ************************************************************* ************************************************************* *************************************************************  There's more, but it all just stopped flowing coz mummy got on my case. Argh... very pissed now. Need to cool off. I hope God's about, coz I could really use his help.

      Hello. I almost clicked publish, but then the power went out. It was a surreal experience. Everything was dark. Peace, yet unknown... know what I mean? At least it mean that she sent me two messages in reply. She had a power outage too. Told her to sleep coz I knew she scars easy in the dark. I tool my bike lights and stuck 'em blinkin by the window. Just to be cheeky. When the power came back on, the neighbourhood erupted with cheers and various slogans like, "VOTE PAP". I was immensely amused.  Got into a fight at school today. Praise Jesus for being in my heart at that time, that I was able to control my actions and tongue. I didn't hit him or use the language that he used. Instead, I pondered upon Jesus and what he would have done. I gave Keith the other cheek today. I was forgiven of my trespasses as I forgave he who trespassed against me. Holier than thou? Not intentionally. Just attempting to live well. Pleasing to Him and Him prioritarily! Errr...  Have to admit, it was cool though. Falling over row after row of seats in a frenzied exchange of violent and recklessly aimed blows. Well, it wasn't really an exchange but it sounds more interesting when read with gusto.  God bless him. In fact, God bless us all.  I miss Zel. Goodnight.

      Hello. Boy, do I have a lot to say tonight. I'll start with my day, then go on to the dream and end with how much I love Hazel.  Well, It was damn complicated lah. Bottom line is I made myself get up late for service which was at 630 when I woke up at 601 and said that I'd blame it on tata. Pati woke me up at 638 and I felt pissed at tata then myself. Rushed to church to catch the ending of sermon on rooftop and closing hymn. He lives He lives... Needed to dance Hi-5 for children but was chicken and didn't have red shirt. Solved that with prayer and Jon Yap respectively.  Reached home to find pati not being there but at church. Took cab to church to get key from pati. Took cab back down. Wrote pati a letter saying that I'd take her to new Zealand and that I loved her so so so much. Went to RSYC and did practical powerboating. Am very good at rescuing fallen people but am unsure of own ability to dock the craft. Did theory after that.  Went back to pati's and left to do medical at holland's silver cross. Had to wait long time so went and sat at starbucks to do reading for tomorrow's GP test. I'm sitting in front of it right now. I have 41 pages to cover and page 22 is still staring me in the face questioning my priorities. Did the medical and came home to B.P.  Now on to the dream. Hazel was in it as usual. But this time, it was weird. We were in some shopping centre looking for the toilets. Couldn't find one so we ended up in this dimly lit faintly petrol smelling basement-carpark. How convenient. Toilets were there. Walked towards the toilet doors and I kissed her on her cheek and told her to meet me outside when we were both done doing what had to be done which was what we had to do. I went into the toilet and felt damn weird lah. It was pissy and crappy. Didn't like it. Got spooked when I saw this damn sinister looking dude standing in the corner, half facing the wall, half facing me. My appointment with mother nature could suddenly wait. Tried to get out but toilet door had no handle. Frantically groped at the upward rafters while he turned his sly face toward me and drifted in my direction. He slammed me about all over the place and I was screaming Zel's name in the hope that she might hear and come and help. She didn't. Then he flung me to the ground and I was damn terrified and crying and all. Then he stood with his crotch above my knee and started pissing. I could see the black of his pants getting darker and soaking onto the brown cargoes I always wear. I was glad he was pissing on me. At least I wasn't gettin stabbed or nuthin... None the less, I was still hysterical. Yah... That's all... I think he was the devil.  Now that I've written about that, I think it wouldn't be appropriate that I talk about Hazel. I tried talking to her today over MSN, but we didn't talk much. I'm afraid of talking to her when we meet too but I still love her all the same. When we talk now, it feels cold, heartless and detached. Like.... I'll finish this in my next entry lah. I need to let it out. Later

      Good evening My eyes close on me. They feel unusually weighty. Like the cross. I have come to the conclusion. Who killed JESUS? I DID. And I'm sorry about it. It rained today, just as I'd predicted, at the time I predicted. Can be used as a good evangelical tool. I reminded Ziz and he told me "By the power of God almighty". I don't know what to say to that, but I wholeheartedly agree.  I watched the passion today. Was uncharacteristically detached during the course of the gorish binge. Wouldn't actually call it a binge, but it makes me sound clever. I did flinch and occasionally scream at the screen for them to "STOP HITTING HIM ALREADY!!!" MY GOD IS GOOD and he did that for me. The very one who murdered him. Cried many times in service. I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown.

       If You Love Someone   If you love someone, Set her free... If she comes back, she's yours, If she doesn't, she's never was....   Read that in an E-mail today. Got pretty upset. Everything seems to be telling me to let go. I don't want to let go. I want to believe. I want to have a true love story to tell my children and grandchildren. That felt weird. I miss her more and more as the days pass. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  Met Dawn on the way home. Discovered that she actually lives pretty close by. She thanked me for talking to her after a shitty day. She was talking to her ex. I told her not to coz it wasn't a good thing to do to get over him.  SCREAMING IRONY IRONY IRONY . She says they're back together and he acknowledges it, but he still treats her like an ex. WHAT A JACKASS! DOESN'T THE BUM KNOW HOW FREAKING LUCKY HE IS!? ARGH!  Dawn is like me. We're going through the "I can't get over my other half" stage. Damned syndrome.  I did my D.I.S.C. personality test for the second time, today. I'm still a D.I. but my I has realllllly dropped like mad! Aiyah! screw personality tests lah, I'll be the best damn judge of who I am. I say I'm a capable leader who's almost equally sociable. Stick modesty up your own butt. I hope the lack of I in my graph does not affect my chances at the presidency. This might. Nvm, I'm supposed to be a risk taker.  Good night.

      Hello, I'm tired today but not very upset now. I'm very stressed though.   On Monday, I went back to Pioneer. I entered the choir room and was greeted with many yells and screams and shouts. It was really pop star treatment. People running to gimme a hug and all. I was really happy. Haven't been that happy in a long while. Oh well, I really took time to look around me during my short visit there. Really appreciate the spacious, open, un-closed corridors and non air conditioned rooms. Pioneer SCHOOL! I loved it. I walked the choir out and everyone was just there and we did what we used to do. I loved it. I loved it! They loved me big time and I really missed them too! I loved it. Oh, I said that already...  On Tuesday, I started my PPCDL course. There's a lot to learn and a lot to pay and I'm really confused about a few concepts, but the knowledge I gain would sure be useful. Impressive too. I hope I make it through in the first try.  I had a dream about Zel. I dreamt that she went to Canada and fell in love with her teacher. And there was something about him... I think he was described as being like Paris, the fine man of wax. OK, I know Canada came from her wish to go back to Canada someday. We used to say that we'd get a small house out in the country with a big back yard where we'd keep 2 horses and 3 dogs. I think there were supposed to be sheep too. Falling in love definitely came from her recent infatuation with some other sec 4 boy, but WHERE THE HELL DID TEACHER COME FROM. I practically couldn't sleep, yet I did and thus my torture was prolonged. This is one recurring nightmare I don't wanna have. I want her back, but not now, I'll have to stick to my objective till the end of the year.  Shall sleep now. Eyes are closing. Lazy to do spellcheck but shall do it anyway for YOUR benefit. ok, Done. byE~

      Am stressed and this has been for about a week now. Please do take into consideration that it's only the second week of school.   I have to finish a lit book by Monday, write a G.P. essay on the analysis of sex versus sexuality education, do an economics essay on the factors which affect demand, about 15 pages of the economics T.Y.S., plan for a Tamil essay exam, study for an economics and G.P. test and read up for my geogeraphy.  I pray thou be my strength oh Lord.  You wanna hear another ridiculous ACJC tale? I went to school today- A SATURDAY, for a 2hr geog lecture in the morning. This was followed by a 2.5hr bass sectional practice and a 6hr choir practice from 12 to 6. Great if you've got no life outside school. I mean, music is a very big part of my being and all, but commandeering my Saturdays? That's low man..  Have been speaking to this girl in school. Her name's Dawn. She's pretty and smart. Good to talk to. Her writing's in a book with Des. She holds Zhiying in high regard. She's nice. It's good to finally meet intellectuals who I can have a real conversation with. Thank goodness for Leon. I have to go do my reading now. I've waited for Des to come online, but she's not. No matter.  Have a happy day.

      I just got home from ACSian theatre's A Midsummer Night's Dream. It was good.  The Dances were the best part of the whole thing. Close to perfection. Exciting and fresh. Everyone wasn't afraid to do what was necessary to get the job done, including karmasutra poses.  The cast was almost perfect in appearance. Perfect looking school for perfect looking people. All the girls were very pretty. Course, it could have been the make up. But really, WOW!  Blocking was fine. Articulation was reasonable, but I felt that some characters displayed too little emotion. Also, there were a few technical glitches and spacial errors. There were a few bumps and smacks here and there... Some lines were fumbled with but promptly picked up. They have to work on their projection technique though. Whilst trying to incorporate suttle emotion into speeches, they become inaudible.  On the whole, I'd give it a 7.9

      What do you do when your world falls apart? Where do you run, when you can't find solace within you? Who is a good replacement? When can you forget?  How do you hit rewind?  I spent about 4hrs sitting at Burger King at Holland today. I slept, thought, moped, cried and left. We stood together, you and I, in front of the glass in the quiet cold with soft elevator-like music playing. On the other side were lovebirds. Close warm secure. I closed my eyes and felt for you hand again, but you were not there.  I'm loosing what I was. My friends tell me to my face that they want the old Tim back. The one who smiled and laughed and made them laugh. "now THAT was Tim!" they said. I looked down and smiled. I want him back too.  Remember how songs fit your life when you want them to? Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday. Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play, now I need a place to hide away,  Oh, I believe in yesterday.

      Hi, was ill today, so I didn't go to school. Am pretty upset about that. Wasted a lot of cash. Firstly, I didn't get to wear the T-shirt which was supposed to be worn today. I paid $15 for that one. Then, I didn't manage to give Cheam his gift which I bought with Leon yesterday. That was a sad $7.50, and then, to top it all off, I didn't go for Geraldine's play which I paid $10 for. All in all, I wasted $25 and a subjective waste of $7.50. Great huh.  Satyish messaged me yesterday and told me the details of the 04S12 class chalet in Sentosa. The dates clash with those of the CAP. Am very upset about this. What rotten luck. To all my S12rs. I'm really really sorry about not being able to come but CAP won't let me out... even for a day. This really sucks. I miss you guys so so so much. I really wanted to see you guys again and do the things we used to do. Lets go out to Seoul Garden or the beach or something ok?  I should make a comparison. S12 loved each other like family for 3 months. We knew when something was wrong with one of out mates just by a look into their eyes. We never left a man behind. S12 had no cliques and we loved everyone regardless of personality type, colour or religion. S12 could play netball! As a team with dynamics! And we were mighty good at it too! I love my S12 and wouldn't trade it for almost anything. Not even a million bucks.  AA2 has some good points too. It helps me rely on God for my daily survival now. I love them but they spit on me. I'll just have to continue showing them love which could only be sustained by God's providence. Also, I'm cool with people like Jem, Khung Lin, David, Daphne, Jason, Cheam. The rest, well, I'm sure they have their good points too.  I've got the CAP briefing tomorrow and I don't even know how to get there. After that, I've got the PPCDL practical re-exam. I really hope I don't fail this time. If I do, It'll cost me another $55 which I really cant afford. Wish me luck.  I have many songs on my computer now. I feel like a pirate. ARRRR MAYYTEEEE! Oh no! It's taking over me!  This is the second time I'm typing out this entry coz the first time, I'd finished, but the com hung on me before I could publish. Feel miserable coz I think there's something that I'm missing from the first entry... ahhh! PSHAW! sod it lah!

      I'm in the computer lab in school now. I don't really like the way things are going in school nowadays. A lot of my classmates are... Well.. Wonderful people. Will talk about that some other time.  I have to tell you about my little "aldersgate" experience. I could sing the song well and I knew the words by heart, but I got nervous when it came to it and my voice quivered in fear. It's coz I screwed up 2 lines during a rehearsal. Great huh. Oh well, like Sidney said, experience and exposure. I have to get over this insecurity thing.  Yesterday, we went to the police academy to watch the rugby finals between ACJC and RJC. All I can say is that pride comes before a fall. Jemima said the same thing this morning during PE. Jem is smart. My throat feels like crap now and I'm having a very bad cold. Level 7.5 zel. hahaha...  I got a message from Zel that really perked up the last hour of the aldersgate day. I was thinking about what I did wrong and I realize. IN Corinthians, the first aspect of love is PATIENCE! That's what I missed out on. I won't make that mistake again. Sumpak!  have to sign off now. ARTS GAMES... I'm ill lah... Play what?! Maybe I'll sign out. We'll see how to wing it.

      I still have 8 pages of writing to do. Very screwed. It's almost eleven. I think I'm even behind Cheam. Literally eleventh hour work.  Um... I think I'll never want to do this to myself again. Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest. I won't do this to myself ever again.  Well, at least I didn't go to Ken's and get wasted.. Will do that next week... heh heh heh. We'll have a ball with our buddies and good old Mr J.Walker.

      I'm tired and still have to finish literature by tonight. I got the new com tonight. It's pretty ah-bengish. Has got a transparent side with many colourful lights, exposing the CPU. Tacky spiderman design overlays the transparent side. Pretty fast. 2.4GHz- I'm glad it's better than a 200MHz. I'm thankful.  Went for drama auditions today. Went well. They said that Leon and I worked well together and that they'd cast us together, more than once. That means more work, but what the hell lah. It's exposure, and that's what I need. Also got put in Aldersgate which plays on Monday. I know nothing about the play and I have to sing the first verse of a song. "And can it be" it's called. I'm supposed to be really happy. Just that, I'm not. Why?  Went to church. Did dancing for the children. There were these 3 mockers. I'm not proud of what I did. I will be stronger the next time. Or am I fooling myself.  Fought with Wei Xin. The deal was that since he didn't have any money, I'd pay the $21 for his ACJC choir concert ticket, and he'd pay me back. My contact bought all the tickets with his own money and now Wei Xin messages me telling me to cancel his order. He refuses to acknowledge that he should take responsibility for what he said he'd do. I called him and blasted him. What a donkey. "Just coz I said ok, and that I'd pay you in the day itself, doesn't mean I agreed to buy the ticket. It's just means that I would consider it, so you should have put my name under the uncertain column." What rubbish. Naive fool. He can't argue without letting his emotions get in the way. Shan't go into that to save him embarrassment.  Will knock some sense into him the next time I see him.  Bitter-sweet days are gay.

      Greetings. Cheers to 2-period days where we're pulled out of school to go to marina south to support the bowling team for 4 hours, and only have to come back to school to take 2 lessons.  Watched Shrek 2 today with Ken. Only got one good laugh out of it. I have come to 2 conclusions which attempt to explain why I wasn't really humored. 1) It's all the damn trailers which let everything out. 2) It's coz I've got so many burdens, that nothing really humors me anymore.  Went to the top of the multi-story carpark. We had time there and it will be within me for a long time to come. Passion when I was broken. Sounds profound? Na-ah. Prayed on the concrete road beneath the stars that I may be shown the way to go in my life and that He would guide me in my ways. Also that he would handle the situation with Zel as he pleases, but that didn't stop me from making my requests with regards to the matter.  Tomorrow = drama auditions = nervous. But will wing it. Wish me luck.  I've realized that I'm behaving like an ordinary teenager, falling in love, madly and irrationally. Unacceptable.

      Today was exciting. I went to see Dr. Sidney Tan with Mama. Sidney is truly a man of God. God has blessed his humble servant with many things. He's got his own practice and a real recording studio in his basement. He's got one of the best pair of ears around and his musical mind is fan-tas-tic! From the way he spoke, I could tell that he knew a lot... as in one of the best in his field, yet he was so humble. Truly a good role model.  I got pointer from him and he took down my contact to pass to his circle. I've listed them in non-chronological order. 1) Always be humble 2) Get as much exposure I can 3) Know what genre suits my voice 4) Know what my range of notes is 5) Thoughts about my permanent occupation vs my Secondary occupation 6) Have talent and be good at what you do 7) Get good at guitar 8) Know basic music theory 9) Remember that what you have is a gift from God, so everything goes back to him. Hurt and Glory. Questions and praise.  I will use these as a checklist. Also, the music might help to take my mind off her. I'm not sure if that's what I want, but I'm leaving it to God. For the next few days, I'll be asking the BIG MAN about what he wants me to do. If what I want is not the answer, I will accept his will. I will be devastated, but I will accept. Sidney told me that if I banked totally on becoming a recording artist, in the event I didn't get it, I'd be totally devastated. I know, but then again, I've been devastated time after time that it's ridiculous and I'm numb.  Got dissed by Tiff today. Was terribly upset that she didn't have the courtesy to tell me that I wasn't to be called for Iskandar's recording auditions. Whatever lah. Numb remember?  Just had a civilized conversation with Hazel. Semi-civilized anyway. Second best part of my day!

      Lezah nodded coldly and walked off without a care in the world. I sat there broken- again. Bitten was I by frost. What was said and what was not said. Joe was disgusted too. She was cold throughout the whole time she sat there. I got no smile from her. Everyone else did. She lies about friendship. I have a snapshot in my head and on my screen.  I looked at her hands. She eats the same way still. Utensils almost vertical, held close to the middle awkwardly yet correctly. Don't bite your nails and crack your knuckles. Do it for me, I pleaded then. My hands have been there, held them, caressed them. Loved them.  It hit me again that she might not be worth it too. She's in the league. Just like most others who can't handle it. I've observed that it's a general trend with Singaporean girls. Can't talk, Uncomfortable, Angst... What's new boys? I want to believe that, to move on coz it's not bearable. But no. She's different. Worth my suffering for. I do, every hour, every day. We'll all get hit sooner or later. So hang on to her. As so eloquently it was put across by Sugar Ray, "We're on this rollercoaster ride, hold on I'll stay here by your side, We'll head up to the sky and we slide back down". Bumpy ride boys, hold on and suck it all up. Do you remember Jesus of the passion, shredded, splintered, bleeding, tortured, carrying his cross alone. I am he now. Save for being impure.  I'm trying to find the fine line- the international boundary, where pride ends, and self confidence begins.  When you think about them, or want them to, so that you feel understood, songs will be your friends. 3 songs I can think of now. First song, I thought of was a few days ago-Heaven Knows. Second was yesterday- Yesterday. Third was today as I walked home- Don't look back in anger. I should dedicate it to her.  Cheers to you and a bright future.

      Why do I share my life with you? Oh my gosh! Dawn just came online and her nick read, "and yes, I'm going to wait because I'm allowed to dream". That is exactly what I told Zel. OH MAN...FREAKY.  So, now, tell me again, why do I share my life with you. You who read it, Are you entertained? Do you want to be entertained? Am I just another link in your favorites list? Do you quote me random phrases off it to show that you read? That you care perhaps? Perhaps I'm wishing.   Perhaps I write to improve myself. To prove to myself? To reflect. The most common excuse yet the most sensible. Do I want to be noticed? Read up on? Cared for? Loved?  Yes.  I was thinking today. About something I've just forgotten. A very worthy insight. Wasted. No matter, think about this. When, you want to see somebody, you'll keep seeing them even if it's not them.. If you can't relate to what I mean, wait till you fall in love.   You will.

      Was happy on Sunday and "sick" on Monday. I laughed on Sunday and was down on Monday. The blues are here and they've brought their luggage with 'em.  Went to watch Van Helsing on Sunday. It was too loud. Bloody funny- literally. When we were buying tickets, we caught this little soccer advert on the preview screen and were pretty amused by what little we saw. Waited for half an hour for the video cycle to repeat itself, but it didn't. After the show, we waited again for about 10 minutes, munching at sugar coated kachang. FINALLY when the advert come on, the guys and I burst into cheer and consequentially, we were given looks by people. We thoroughly enjoyed the advert and laughed out butts off and all. I was happy. I was happy. I was.... happy  Am unable to take the stress of JC. Am seriously cracking up. Didn't go to school today. Had "acute fatigue syndrome"... hahahaha... Even then, I wasn't able to finish my reading. Still have got 12 pages to go. Am very upset. I need God.  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows.

      Did Tamil oral exam today. Went for one of our old breakfasts with Leon. Kaya toast with half-boiled egg and teh-peng. I miss those days. Life was good then. I long to hit rewind.  Went back to PJC to get the VCD of the official opening, but got sooooo caught up in meeting my old pals and listening to hopeless bands that I forgot to get it. Jun reminded me. Just got off the phone with her. She's a real sweetheart. Hey Jun! I know you're reading this! yes you are.... gucci guccii goooo... Anyway, I was very happy when I got back to PJ. It's like Fairfield. And Pioneers, that's an honor.  I felt forgotten coz I went back to FMSS to get my year-book. I realized that my picture wasn't in Talentime which Oracion won, or in Joie de Vivre, which I soloed in. So dissed. But what the hell lah, I remember and people that matter remember. I'm just trying to make myself feel better. And to all you wonderful overly enthusiastic critics reading this, there isn't anything wrong with feeling dissed. It's called a human emotion. I don't want to be forgotten. I want to be remembered. My life will not be normal coz I can dream and I will keep dreaming. Oh, but Zel's got pretty photos up, and I'm on the same page. So honored... Really. I love my Fairfield and I love my choir. It's my baby.  Told a friend something profound today. IT just came out. Was pleased and thought for a second that I just might be abit special. She asked me if it was wrong to like someone else when you're with someone else. I told her that in life, many puzzle pieces will fit, but only one will be a perfect match for the shade of blue or the other half of the circle. Basically, I told her that she shouldn't be tied down to one fella if another fella is better suited for her. However, I didn't agree with justifying it, upon which I presented several counter arguments. I'm sentimental.  I can dispense good advice, yet practical application is an obstacle. For the record, I'm going to say that though I'd done many dumbass things with/to Zel while I was in secondary school, I am happy with the way I was. I'm afraid I'm changing, becoming less expressive, or, more subdued. Like in a zoo or circus where they whip you and tame you and teach you tricks. Stand on one leg Tim. "ok master". Will write more in upcoming entries if it still burns, which it will, just like everyday for the past few months.  Remember children, mathematics causes cancer.

      Have lost purpose. Went to see TROY alone today. I'm like that Achilles, wanting my name to be remembered. Difference is I wasn't born to kill. I have nothing that makes me stand out. I'm ordinary.... urgh...  Had a very stressful night last night. Worse than a rollercoaster. Spoke to Zel last night. Well I spoke and she... well.. she was pissed. What's new? We worked things out.. again... and decided to go back to friends... again... and I'll build from there. It's going to take years. Experts tell me that I'm crazy, and that I'm living in a dream land. They just MIGHT be right. The conversation ended better only slightly worse than it began, as when contrasted with a lot worse. I don't know how long this "it's cool and we're ok" thing (geee... sounds familiar?)is going to last. I don't even know if she's playing me, but I chose to see sincerity in her over-enthusiastic appraisal of recent "incidents". I still love this girl. 5 months and 17 days.  I told this guy on the bus off after the show. He had a video cam on the seat beside him and this girl couldn't sit down. He was just a pain. He was slightly stunned, getting told off by someone who's probably more than 5 yrs his junior. I didn't feel good about it, but at least an old lady could have her seat.  Went to the place I was before and walked aimlessly.  Sat on the swing and looked at the stars alone. We were there once, You and I. I wrote your name in the sand and told you that I loved you.   I was too scared to kiss you though I wanted to.

      Hello. I think I'm loosing my thing for singing. I still wanna make it, but I'm not sure I have the ability to. Will work on it... Will talk to Sidney (Who is coincidentally the brother of Pastor Malcom Tan) and find a voice coach... I have to. Can NOT screw up this one. It'll be the end of me.  I went to watch the SYF Drama production. Brilliant. What can I say? Nothing short of brilliant. Mrs Geetha Creffield is a genius (and it's not like I haven't said it before). I really look forward to working under her. You know, I almost felt proud. OK...OK... I felt proud of something that belonged to ACJC. There! I said it. Even as the crew set up the stage, WOW! MAN! WOWWWWW!!!! They worked fast, They worked precise. Beautifully done. The crew's work was art too. The acting was good on the most part. Few accents were REALLY off, but that's ok... a few actors were a bit... um... trying to be actors? I don't know how to put it.  I shan't say any more coz I'm not sure if I could do any better. But in the event I can't I'd really like to learn. I've just realized that by saying that, it's humility. Urgh... I think it's a good thing, but I really don't want to loose my charisma. Will really have to sit down and think about what I want to become. A product is out of the picture.  Oh one more thing, TJC's was good, though I didn't really fancy it. HOWEVER, I really have to take my hat off to M.I. Simple play, no fancy smoke machines or lights at all. Just some furniture and the only sound effect was that of a knocking mortar thing, and even that was "home-made". But there was this girl who pulled off the funny old lady REALLY RREEAALLLLLYYY WELL. It was very good.  Signing off. oh wait... Thanks to Cheam and Leon. Who needs girls when you've got boys like these... Interpret that in any way you please to amuse yourself.

      Hey. Wanted to put this down yesterday but decided not to spoil the mood.   There was this bus driver who refused to let me get on the bus. I politely tapped on the door and gestured for him to let me in. He flicked his hand signaling me to bugger off. Boy.... Nobody messes with me! I took a cab and told the driver to beat the 74 to the next bus stop. It had moved on pretty far so I ended up at the bus stop before sunset way. At the junction before that, the taxi stopped at the light and I paid the man $4, telling him that we wouldn't have time to complete the financial exchange later. At the bus stop, I thanked the nice taxi man and hopped out. Hailed the bugger's 74 and BOY OH BOY you should have seen his face when he saw me. I got on, slammed my wallet onto the reader, stood there staring at him, and after a long pause, said "hi".  I then walked over to my two very amused friends who'd seen what'd happened but didn't know how I got there that quick. Before I got off, I walked up to the old jerk, smiled contently, said "bye" and got off.   See, I handle difficult situations well don't I?

      A beautiful song. A beautiful voice. For a beautiful girl.     Rick Price- Heaven Knows.   She's always on my mind From the time I wake up, till I close my eyes She's everywhere I go She's all I know.  Though she's so far away, it just keeps getting stronger, everyday. And even now she's gone, I'm still holding on  So tell me where do I start, coz it's breaking my heart Don't wanna let her go  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows And maybe out hearts will find their way Only heaven knows And all I can do is hope and pray, coz heaven knows  My friends keep telling me, that if you really love her, you've gotta set her free And if she returns in kind, I'll know she's mine  But tell me where do I start, coz it's breaking my heart Don't wanna let her go  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows And maybe out hearts will find their way But only heaven knows And all I can do is hope and pray coz heaven knows why I live in despair coz why do we go dreamin I know she's never there And all the time I act so brave I'm shaking inside, why does it hurt me so?  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows And maybe out hearts will find their way, but only heaven knows And all I can do is hope and pray, coz heaven knows Heaven knows Heaven knows

      Have a lot to say today. Mother's day. I listened to a song which reflects exactly how I feel. It's called "heaven knows". Will blog the lyrics tomorrow. Angeline's got a high fever and I'm very worried for her. Family went to this restaurant for lunch and were treated like V.I.P.'s after which a crazy cook lady came to me and said she was having cookies for lunch. She walked away, then came back and said "excuse me, coffee too". I smiled.  Took a nap on my bed for the first time since then. Pillow was musty smelling. We used to talk on the bed. It's sacred ground.  Just spoke with previous entry's "she". It's sad coz the girls who I'd expect to be able to handle it -can't. I'm numbed again. Just like a political aftermath. It's good in a way, coz I become un-feeling, to hurt at least. She tells me that I'm not the first good friend to do this. Gee... then I wonder who it falls to then. Deja-vu. Then again, boys are dumbasses, so it's always our fault. I'm going to leave her be, and pray. Pray that God works in her life. She is capable of big things. I'm not going to stop caring, or forget this, and her, and what she's done in my life. At very least, I'll have a few very good memories of a very good friend. At this, a farewell salute to you, very good friend. I can only hope, that what you believe currently, fades to new light in time. Love you and take care.  A new day and perhaps a new Dawn.

      I am upset today. Was in the canteen and she walked in. She talked to Colin. She didn't reply my SMS about her coming back to church. She agreed to a few weeks ago. She was asked by me if she'd come for Saturday's class or Sunday's service. She shook her head and answered inaudibly "no, I'm not coming back" followed by a "can you please leave me alone". I just stood there, stunned. Colin giggled nervously. Went upstairs to cry. What did I do wrong now? Just 2 days ago, she said that things were fine. Distraught.  Ran my 2.4 today. First time I've run 6 rounds in 6 months. Got 11.50. Was happy, but not now.  Met new people today. Some drama, some Media Resource. They're all nice. This girl messaged Feodor like 15 minutes after we left, to ask him to tell me that I was the first real gentleman she'd met in ACJC. I was momentarily flattered, But not now.  I miss Hazel terribly. The silk of her hair. Would you miss me? Maybe I should end it, but not now.

      The most queer thing happened today. Couple of people from minds come down to school to sell things today. I was at the void deck doing lit with a couple of other acquaintances. I wish I could use a different word, but they don't deserve it. Anyway, so this lady walked up to our table and quietly set her basket down and looked blankly at us. But she was pulling me, or I was pulling myself, so I got out my wallet and have her everything I had... And I picked one $1 bookmark and it read something. I cant remember what. Btw, this lady's got down syndrome. So anyway, I looked at this bookmark and said, ok... I like this one. But she took another one out of the basket and placed it on top of mine. Like she knew it was meant for me. Weird. It read, "don't tell a woman that you're unworthy of her love - she knows."  OH MAN!!! FREAKING LITTLE INDIA PARROT TYPE SHAT!!! I took it - needless to say.  I listened to Zel's voice 2 days ago over Joe's speaker phone as he spoke to her. I could have  cried. I miss her voice over the phone. She was nice. I tried calling her that night at home, but her maid picked up and tried to communicate to me that she'd gone to the clinic. I couldn't call back later. Next day I messaged her asking if she was ok and told her that I'd called. She killed me for calling, saying that she didn't want her parents to think that we were still together. However, she did acknowledge that she knew I cared. Well, that's enough for me. She told me never to call again.  Listening to her voice reminded me what I was around for. I'm going to get her back. It's just going to be a very long wait. Her having a crush on some jock and all. Good things come to those who wait, and fie to me for thinking about drug addictions.  I miss Hazel.

      Cut vertical so it's harder to stop and stick it in hot water so it can't stop. 2 things I've learned. This is my version of Harry Hudini's (did I spell his name right?) escape trick. ESCAPISM IS THE WAY!! woohoo! (Who am I trying to kidd)   Spoke to my friend today. Apologized profusely for being a jerk and a screw up. They always say that things will never go back to the way it was before. I will never understand that. I don't work that way. I'm not confrontationalist.  Many thanks to all my readers. Almost make me feel better. Almost. Will get advice on how to improve the look of this page so that you guys have a more pleasant read. AnonymouS = Shane Ng maybe? Keep tagging boys and girls! Interaction is key!  At about 10 I got out of the shower and did 1 pull-up and got shocked as hell coz it only hit me after I did it. I screamed at my mom and did another one! Bought a $140 box of 18 servings of Myoplex and another bottle of amino acid pills... I'm a druggie! So exciting! Time to get big and stay that way. Not coz girls like jocks though. I choose to pursue more objective objectives. It's for my career thing. Being a artiste is hard work. AND YES! I WILL BE AN ARTISTE! WITH THE "E" AT THE BACK COZ IT'S CLASSIER! HUMPH!  I've still got 40 pages of reading to do for Geog test tomorrow and it's 1250 already. Die. Oh btw, my long awaited meeting with the producer is coming. Apparently Sidney Tan's been commissioned to be the music director for Idol. He'll hook me up.  I love you guys.

      I have to be one of the biggest screw up around. 1) I screw up by even going to the place I'm studying at now.(Sorry, cant mention names coz I have to protect the solid rock of good reputation upon which the institution stands.) I just don't fit with my class, hopefully I'll fit with my CCA.  2) I screwed up by getting into a fight with a boy (I wonder who) and the second top point of authority there. (gee)  3) I screw up things with a lady who could have been a very good friend.  4) I screwed up my UWC scholarship thing. Today I was told by a source that I was a prime candidate who some of the interviewers would have very much liked to have given me the scholarship, and were very sad when they couldn't, coz I wasn't at peak performance that day.  I'm so messed up, I feel like swearing. So many lost opportunities to make something great out of my life. I want to curl up in a corner and sob over spilt milk. It helps.

      Hello. I miss my past, just as complicated, but I had friends and was happy. Ever so often I'd revisit my fast just like I did today. Out of AC into home, a gate away. They performed for me and we played on the monkey bars. I love the people of my past.  I have to talk to her tomorrow to explain things that she already knows. I'm not even sure if I understand. Or should I just call her now? I close my eyes and sigh like I've been doing all day long. I've been cut again. Hurray! Why don't you smile there friend. Why don't you sit there, in your comfy little chair, and bloody smile. You like this don't you?

      I will relight my star. There was a wet girl standing in the bus staring at me occasionally as I stared back. Our eyes spoke yet they said nothing. Only last night through my memory did they begin to be heard. What was she saying? Her hair was damp and bunched up with a pin. Fringe fell alongside her face as she glowed.  You were there too, telling me things unspoken. That which I had wished I had not heard. Silence in a distempered head.  Went to Steph's house last night for my first and their second class party. H.U.G.E. Wow.. It takes quite a while to get from one end of the house to the other. Also, she's got a pool and art and her TV room's a freaking cinema! Literally! As in PROJECTOR!!!! AARRGGHHHHH!!! So what? I'm content with what I have. Am I? Are you?  Was walking home and saw a police blockade ahead. They were checking every car. Funny Shat. Then, a walked down the hill and saw many HEAVILY MODIFIED CARS sneaking off in all directions very very quietly. Haha... funny assed shat! No points for guessing what was going on.  I was thinking about a beautiful girl. She likes poetry slams and literature.

       The Experiment  When your eyes are closed, You are forced to look at the dark inside of you. Dual dimensional, you try to prove your worth "I am sophistication! TRUTH!" Tomorrow will be yesterday When you live in a falsifying fream. Denial may feed inferiority But when you die, I'd never have known you Or what you stood for. Like the indefinite clicking of a turning bicycle wheel You reincarnate.

      Hello! READER! I have so so so much to say, but I won't say it today. I would finish next May even if I started today. I have learnt so much, of poetry, drama and such, that when I'm happy... I don't miss  her  touch.  I can't think of any more rhymes now... too tired.. And I'll be mugging till late coz I've got exams on, on monday. Will post a super duper trooper looong one about CAP soon.  What I want to tell you now is this.  I'M BACK! In more ways than just the tangible aspects of my being.  I am happy.

      I spoke with an old friend from Choral Fest '02 yesterday. His name is Joshua and he's now the President of the VJ chorale. Another guy, Gabriel, from my group is also in VJ chorale and he's the student conductor. Berneese from the UWC group is now the Arts faculty president in her college and darling Jolyn is the Vice President of AC's drama company. Sharm's got a place in the committee and Leon Toh, Debra, Khin and Shyama have each received a 72 thousand dollar scholarship. Heh.. seems like so many of the people I know have made it. I'll leave it to you to decide what IT is, coz I know that that's a question you'd ask me. Is power desirable? Is envy desirable? YES! it is! For me at least. Now, don't get me wrong. I may envy these people, but I'm very happy for them too. I entered ACJC wanting to make a difference. To prove something. That a Fairsian could make it in a place dominated by ACS(I)'s and (B)'s and MGS's. I was almost there. but the keyword here, dear reader, is ALMOST. Farewell my finery. So.. heh... what's tim? I don't know, maybe it's time I woke up and realized that not all leadership depends on position. I know so much about this and philosophy and shat like that yet I DON'T PUT IT TO USE! And all it does for me is make me miserable. Ho.  I spoke with Zhu Ping till 4am then decided not to sleep after that too. He's exceptional in many ways- inclusive of a level of finesse in wit which few possess. I realized that many judge the value of an actor by the role he plays. It's true and actors who read this are likely to agree. What ever happened to "There are no small roles, only small actors"? We also realized that the Fairsian character is liked everywhere except AC. We have fun being stupid and they entertain themselves by killing each other. Damn them all. Bitter about it still. Don't know if I'll ever get over it.  Today, I woke up half an hour after I was supposed to meet Jolyn, Sharmini and Joo Sheng at Boon Lay. I felt pretty bad about it and took  cab down. We went to Raffles Marina and headed off on a fisherman. You can see the fisherman in this link here.  urlLink Fisherman . So anyway, we got on and floored it north east at about 33-34Km/h. Fast enough thank you very much. Sheng was a great host. OK. I have to say that my life is filled with the "lighter" kinda fun like expeditions rather than the darker kind like.. I don't know.. Smoking and pubs. So anyway, I always tell all my friends that there are 2 places which I belong. On the stage and on the water. These are my passions. However, I wasn't HAPPY today though I tried to be. We did it all! Sharp 360's, 720's, full throttle, sat at the bow with face and hair full of wind but I didn't get there. Call it a type of Nirvana. I'm sad that I wasn't happy. Well, at least the girls were pleased, so as an entertainer, I did my job.  For now, I'll sleep uneasily because I have all the undone revision waiting to kill me when I return from CAP. I think I might screw up my terms. P.S.H.A.W.! Will bring work along to squeeze in during plenaries or break times which I doubt will happen.  I will be at CAP next week so this is likely to be my last entry for the next six days. HOWEVER, rest assured I'll have a tale to tell when I return. I have high expectations of myself and my ability "with people". I will test that ability during the next six days and we'll see if the old spunk's still about Tim. Wish me luck and for the Christians, say a little prayer for me would you. That I may find what I'm looking for.

      Hello reader. Today was slightly more productive than yesterday. I sent out 50 copies of the PW survey and will only be allowed to send out the next 50 via Email by the hotmail staff in about 15 hrs time. Betcha didn't know that you could only send 50 Emails a day. Oh, you did?... Fine! Have been thoroughly entertained by the replies that have come in so for the homosexuality survey. One can clearly differentiate arts from science respondents. Shall blog entertainingly about it when I have the time.  Just got off the phone with Jolyn. It's 2.31am. I don't want to get too close to her. I'm afraid I'd screw things up again. None the less, she's lovely. Snarf. Meep. ho... Jo makes noises and Sharmini talks trash about being lonely. Ho... Girls and love are like fire, nice to be around coz they keep you warm, but get too close and you get burned. I learnt that. I'm still recovering but dreams add salt to my wounds nightly.  FMSS choir concert is on a Tuesday preceding my econs exam, smack in the centre of exam week. My baby is more important. I put my life into that choir. I've family there. I go for concert.  Leon Oei had a gig at church today. He said that they lost the competition but he had a great time anyway and then said something about going deaf.. I envy him. Looks, personality, physique, acts well, drums well, swims well, pretty girlfriend... guitar, bass, 11 pts, band. If I actually did a list, I'd finish tomorrow. I guess I'll always be in his shadow. Dorcas is nice too. OH MY GOSH! It just hit me that they've been on since before dec sev! Shit! WHAT CAN HE NOT DO! WHY CAN'T I!   I'm an envious person. Optimists call it ambitions. I'm pessimistic. Bite me.

      Hello.  I woke up at 230pm today. Did 15 newspaper articles and finished that by 750. All I had to do was read, cut and highlight. I'm efficient. Oh and by the way, I didn't do anything else today other than that though I still have 2G.P. compres which I'm gonna screw, A book review which I'm gonna cheat at, an econs essay which I can't cheat at and a case study... what's a case study? Urgh... I feel sick and I HATE STUDYING.  I want to sing and have people sing my songs as they listen to the radio every night! I'm meant to do that! Either that, or I'm meant to dream of it. Maybe I'm meant to be an example of a dreamer who lost it all when he chased the impossible. But if you take impossible not as a statement, but a challenge, it won't be impossible.  Speaking of dreams, I had a dream. Guess who boys and girls! YES! Guess who's back, back again. She must be pretty tired after running through my head all day long. It's just that, this dream came to me at 1230pm. I remember, coz daddy asked me what I wanted for lunch, and I mumbled something and fell asleep again. Remember I ran into her at a food place the other day? Well, I was in a cab (later I had a fight with the fat cabbie which involved me calling the police)(and I called 999 with my cell phone and some girl came on and put me on hold! Then a guy came on and told me that if I wanted to call the police, I had to use a public pay-phone)(Funny assed shat). So anyway, the cab stopped right in front of her table at the open aired food place. You know at night.. with one of those big round wooden tables at coffee shops. This table was slightly smaller.  She smiled at me. It didn't say I love you, but it did say I'm happy to see you. Her parents weren't around. But when they returned, I had to go for some unknown dreamy reason and I bid them farewell. They all smiled! I was so happy!  I suppose dreams tell you what you really want. Your innermost desires. I'm afraid to go to camps. It's embarrassing. But if you think about it, is it really? Oh! And from what I've noticed for me, I dream of things that I thought about 2-3-4 days earlier. I think it takes time to get to the subconscious part of your mind.  Think about this, "In a dysfunctional world, being dysfunctional is normalcy". I spoke to Khin. She's special. Funny, sporty, S.M.A.R.T. Her scholarship will take her to New-Mexico. From what I see now, she's definitely the type of person I'd like to know when I grow up. I have to keep the UWC group together.  I'll be sending out a survey to my address book by tomorrow. It's on homosexuality and I'd really appreciate it if YOU filled it out the best you can. It counts pretty heavily toward my OVERALL A-Level grade, so please help me out. Thanks. Later.

      I spent like 5 hours at the King Albert Park McDonalds today. Did only 1.5 hours worth of work. This was interspersed with chatter with Leon Toh and him trying to hook me up with various girls. Oh! I charmed them alright. Charmed them out of their seats and away from me is what I did. Ho..  Have created a picture gallery. It's at  urlLink http://oracion.mypicgallery.com . Will put the link up on the sidebar soon. There's only a few photos us coz it takes hell long to upload them. The first album is about my happy days. It's not all the photos that I've got, but these will do to bring you the idea.  Will be in a play by drama soon. I'll get stripped and kicked and tied up. No darlings, it's not raunchy. It's a comedy of words. Don't expect elaborate songs, dance, lights, sounds, or props coz you wont get any. If you wish to place orders for tickets, hold your horses. I don't know the details but I think it'll be staged in late July. Will supply further details when I am furnished with them.  Yesterday I asked you to go love your Parents. Today I'm going to tell you to appreciate grass. Seriously. It's under-appreciated, but is so vital to our survival. If you don't buy all that, just get in contact with Ma Nature.  Began to think about Zel again. This cannot be. There has to be a solution. But really, cutting helps for a while. I stood in the dark and watched you brush your hair. Hurrah for 62A. Meet me there.

      Hello Reader! I'm at my desk now, which by the way is steeped in newspaper article clippings. I've got to do 45 by tonight and 2 comprehensions. I know I wont meet this self imposed dateline, but what the heck. Still have to do about 5hrs of econs work and a lot of geography revision and a lot of Tamil memory work. Oh well... Take it as it comes. I just know that I have to finish the bulk of my work by this week coz I'm going into CAP next week. Will definitely have a ball. It's a period of tribulation too.  I realized that I know things about leadership. I should write a list called, "What Tim knows of how to be a good leader." Also, I've been thinking about nonconformists and how society and ourselves can coexist. It's not A.B.C. but it's a conceptual notion which could materialize if we knew how.  The wounds on my wrist and arm close and heal. I think the one's inside me are doing the same, but I caught myself thinking about her as I ate lunch today. I don't think I want to let go. That's all about that for now.  Yesterday was Mummy's birthday. I don't know how old she is but that doesn't change anything does it. It's a natural cycle. The annual event repeats itself many times till you expire. It's a count down, except, it counts up. Nothing particularly celebrate(able) about a birthday when you come to think about it. It isn't an indication of maturity, but it does tell you how much time you have left before you die. Celebrate that then. It also tells you when you're allowed to watch NC16 films, then RA films... smoke... drink... have sex.. (officially that is). HURRAY FOR BIRTHDAYS!  Des and I had a good talk about our fathers. I told her about my past. I'm not sure if I should tell you. It's funny how we all take things for granted. When we were young, everything taught us about why we shouldn't take things for granted. But we still do. I guess we forget the fairytales and nursery rhymes we were raised on. Maybe it isn't our fault that our young minds couldn't take the laborious over-repetition. Maybe it wasn't our fault we took the advice itself about jealousy, heartbreak, humility and everything else for granted. Everything happens for a reason. Just do yourself a favour reader. Go tell your parent(s) and grandparent(s) that you love them. Don't do it quickly. Take their hands, look them in the eye and mean it coz you know you do. There's nothing to be ashamed of; for when you truly value someone, every simple phrase takes on a whole new meaning.  You'll realize that your mother's "pick up your clothes" is for your own good and that your father goes out of his way to drive you to school and bring you home because he loves you.

      Was going to totally thrash the DASH programme in church today but I decided against it. There are other things and people which happened today too. Not worth mentioning. Will not go for another youth organised event ever again.  Became a bit sad again. Inferiority complex again. Didn't connect as well as I'd hoped with the NJC touch rugger girls. It was like a proving ground for myself. Will try again at CAP. Leon Toh connected damn well though. They literally told him to pack 'emselves up in his suitcase and take them away to Italy with him. I envied him for that. Inferiority complex speaking.  Spoke with Jolyn and Desiree. They're sweethearts. I like 'em.  Good night. (Yes... a short entry...)

      Today, I was happy. It's the first time, in a long time.  Today I was amidst love. It's a powerful thing this "love". It's given to you many times and in many ways. You too show love in many ways... It's just the "many times" bit which is subjectively based on your character and how introvert or bitter you are.  Yes boys and girls, Simon Cowell shows love too. Through all the tactless advice, is sometimes criticism. If contestants throw away the nasty adjectives, they'll find real stuff to work with in there.  OK. Mr Wee Tat Chuen got married today. I was there at the wedding and I think I needed it. A dose of something little to tell me that romance is not dead. I felt sorry for him though, coz most of the guests were real fools. Babies were crying and their parent's didn't have the sense to leave the ballroom with them, handphones went off when we were told to put them to silent. I mean, even if we were not, it's common sense isn't it? And don't give me that shit about forgetting! It's a wedding! "NO FORGETTING" is a sign that ought to be placed on the door. Also, there was a terrible amount of mumbling going on. I wish people, especially those older than me would respect the ceremony and SHUT UP. You have over 500 people in the ballroom, and say 200 are murmuring. THAT'S A HELL LOT OF MURMURING!  Ah well, I was happy for them and I took n the ceremony like a breath of fresh air. I saw many old friends but it was weird coz it was just different. I was among strangers. And I know it's petty, but I just felt like another guest. It wouldn't have made a difference if I hadn't gone. After the "high tea" a group of us (the others) went to ZARA, ESPRIT, BORDERS and STARBUCKS. We had a good time. Will place insightful notion later.  Then went to Leon (Toh)'s place for a BBQ dinner. Anand came over. Was somewhat glad to see him. He reads this page and told me that the writing inspires him. Thank you boss! He's a nice guy just doing his job. We're similar in some ways. Anyway, for the time he and his friends were there, the group was consumed in UWC chatter. I kinda wish they'd have been more considerate, but I guess it's the only thing that binds them together, so it's ok. Jolyn and I took the opportunity to steal away to a corner and talk. I like Jolyn. She's real.  When the rest had left, Leon, Deb, Jolyn, Shyama and I talked till 1215 about things. Life, people, choices, rugby and we were ourselves. I am happy even when I think about it. We were just sitting and talking in his garden. Very very nice. I love my UWC mates. It was plain and simple and we could communicate our ideas without inhibition. We don't just talk facts and figures, we talk feelings too! I LOVE IT!!! It's upsetting that I couldn't get chosen. My life would be MUCH better. Would do almost anything for a chance. Oh well. Like I said, I've made many bad decisions this year. I have to set the boating trip up soon. Have to give special mention to Deb. The 10 A1, athlete who's a real beauty with a great smile and bright sparking eyes.  Leon and I sat at the bus stop for about 20 minutes talking even though we knew the bus wasn't going to come. I love him. We spoke of our kind and religion and he offered to force me to study. I gladly took him up on that. I sound self righteous? Bite me!  God didn't choose to give me the scholarship but he gave me friends which I could keep for life. I want to keep these people. We are different. Some of us are shunned in certain social circles coz we're misunderstood. We are united in that in some sense. We are different. We have practical intelligence rather than system intelligence. Not that we're duphuses when it comes to homework. It's just that we think all the time. We like to think. It's habitual. Sure we walk about with songs playing in our heads too, but simultaneously, not many people there can comprehend the mass of thought which helps us in a way, appreciate our WORLD better. I am looking forward to facilitating interaction between the Tamils and Sinhalese in the conference.  I have tested myself today. I worked fine and enjoyed myself as well as thoroughly entertained my Fairfield friends as well as my UWC friends. So the problem with the AC classmates is not my fault. It's theirs'. Great! Tim's coming back boys and girls. Hold on to your hats. It'll take a bit of time, but as my favourite cyborg used to say, "I'll be back"

      They were all dead. Love kills. Did I love her? Was there a choice? The past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it, but it's like looking down into the grave of your love. Or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling inside it's dark nest, ready to blow your head off.  I opened my eves and everything slid into focus. I was hurt, my crime, was like a hungry pit behind me. I had to run, get as far away from it as possible. It was past the point of no return. The fatal choice already made, and it would get worse before the end. The past is a puzzle, like a broken mirror. As you piece it together, you cut yourself. Your image keeps shifting and you change with it. It could destroy you or drive you mad. It could set you free.  You'll see the choices you didn't know you'd make, like staying at work late to chat with a friend instead of hurrying home to your family. Kissing her, I think of the cold laws of cause and effect. I am afraid, but I start again from the beginning, trace my steps to the scene of the crime. I had to be punished for what I had done. "Like brother's caught on opposite sides of a civil war".  Something in the night felt like a door had been opened. An echo of the past, an old monster snapping it's eyes open in the depths of my brain. Closing your eyes forces you to look at the darkness inside. I hadn't slept in a long time. When I did, my dreams were nightmares. In a nightmare, every choice you make is a wrong one. I would wake up at night afraid that day was a dream I'd forget.  When you're waking up, the world is a blur. What was clear in a dream suddenly makes no sense. No surreal rescues, no magic way out, but you ARE awake. Fraternising with the enemy, I had stepped over the edge. The cartoon moment waits for the coyote to realize his mistake before taking the plunge.  The things that I want- by Tim W. A whiskey, a smoke, for the sun to shine. I want to forget, to change the past, my baby back, unlimited ammo and a license to kill, but right now, more than anything I want her.  To kill those who were trying to kill me, the bullet, real or imagined, lodged in my head, routing my synapses. Driving me on. But surely, as the bullet rips through the victims flesh, organ and bone, it shatters the image of the man who pulls the trigger. This is what I see when I look back. The moments, blinding as snow, they kill you, change you. You die and live again. Remade.  The genius of the hole. No matter how long you spend climbing out, you can still fall back down in an instant. You come to, amidst the wreckage of your own making. You stay there, eyes squeezed shut, afraid to move, hoping you'll bleed to death. Or do you crawl out, help you loved ones, make sure the fire doesn't spread, try to fix it?  All this time, we got the fable of sleeping beauty wrong. The prince didn't kiss her to wake her up. No one who's slept for a hundred years is likely to wake up. It was the other way. He kisses her to wake himself up from the nightmare that's brought him there.  There are things in life you cannot choose. How you feel... I had lain at the bottom of the pit long enough. Too long. The only true reason why men fight wars is love. Death is inevitable. Our fear makes us play it safe, blocks out emotion. It's a losing game. Without passion, you're already dead. It's all a matter of perspective, tied to time and space. Love and friendship, life and death. Everything is subjective, choices, answers, good and evil.  Einstein was right. Time is relative to the observer. When you're looking at the tip of a blade, time slows down, your whole life flashes by, heart break and scars. She was beautiful. I hated her for making me feel this way. I didn't deserve to walk away. There are no happy endings. The illusion comes afterwards when you ask, "why me" and "what if". When you look back, you see the branches like a pruned bonsai tree or forked lightning. If you had done something differently it wouldn't be you. It would be someone else looking back asking a different set of questions.  The past is a gaping hole. Your only chance is to turn and face it, but it's like kissing the lips of your dead love. Darkness waiting in the hole of her mouth. We are willing to suffer, to die for the things we care about. For love, for the right choices. Because of her, I had solved my case. All of it, who I am. It's almost morning. Waking up from my dream. She has brought me here. To this moment of clarity, where time slows down and I choose to look back, to see myself.  And in that moment of clarity, in that act of seeing, I am reborn. I had a dream of her. She was gone, but it was all right.

      I believe that my life was changed in the last thirteen hours. I spent time with Leon and a few memories. Hazel messaged me and said that she wanted to cut all ties. I couldn't accept this ending. It was ordinary and ill-fitting. There had to be another way I desperately told myself and her, but she wouldn't listen. And because she wouldn't listen to my say in a matter which concerned the both of us, I'm the one who always wanted MY WAY.  I smashed a shaver when I arrived home and sat in the corner of the kitchen. It hurts but you just do it over and  over again. They say it takes your internal pain away, but it doesn't. It just adds to it on the whole. I went more than half way. Almost deep enough where when you broke the barrier, there was no turning back. But I didn't have the strength to finish it.  I had to start my homework, but I was faint and slept on the unevenly red polka dotted tiles. The cold was warm. Familiar. I went for the concert and told myself that if I didn't see one choir which blew me away, I'd return to the kitchen floor and finish what I started.  God has his ways of accommodating our insolence. There was the   urlLink novo concertante manila  . I cried when I heard them. Their music was true and humble. I have performed for slightly over a decade now, and alot of what I've seen and heard pales in comparison to this. I'm not in awe of their technique- which was flawless by the way. It's just that it was almost divine. I have no words to describe their ministry. All the rest of the choirs after them were so disheartened, they all gave up. I will be eternally grateful to novo concertante manila for saving me. I walked out of the concert hall and saw them selling their CD and T-shirts. I wanted to buy the CD but I was short of $5 coz I only had $20. Being so grateful, I told them of my intentions and how they turned the tide. I walked away a solemn yet peaceful man. One of the novo girls rushed to grab me by the hand and pulled me back. They gave me the CD and their gratitude for $20 because they were so touched by my tale.  Tonight, their song was God's mercy and gift to me. Thank you.  I thought a lot today. I have had 2 new revelations. I broke up with Zel to secure release from the pain of not being able to spend time with her. That plan back-fired and it just hurt me more. Things have a funny way of going wrong when they can huh Murphy? Secondly, Seng told me today that I can't let go, coz there is no reason to. He is right. There isn't. I'm not sure what I feel now. It's mostly a void. I'm not sure I want to fall in love again. It always hurts too much when you do.  I asked the monkeys today what life meant to them. They described it as a very big concert hall in which your perfect chords loose their rightful value, yet your errors are accentuated by worldly equalization. It's true.   There was a young monk who built a wall of a hundred bricks. Each placement was fastidiously set and the wall was 99% perfect. There was one brick however which was ajar because he had elbowed it accidentally and hadn't noticed. This brick was in the centre of the wall and the young monk was very sorrowful when he noticed it. Two wise old monks walked past the wall one day whilst the young monk sat beside the wall moping. They marveled at the wall with great awe and praised the young monk. The young monk was puzzled and said that there was still a bad brick in the wall. The wise monks told him that they were not concerned with the bad brick but were in wonder of the 99 good ones. Why cant the world be like that?  Life to me cannot be described in a sentence. Right now, the most profound thing I could think of saying, is that life can be defined with three letters. Just one word. "His". Think about it.  I will try to pre-occupy myself with music. I think that's what I was born to do. Nobody in my family was ever  into  it, yet since I could walk, I tottered up to the tele to wave my arms about; conducting the music. I'm not a prodigy and I'm not remotely good, but I will be. And when I am, WATCH YOU OUT!  In the mean time, I don't know why I'm sitting here with a bleeding arm. again, again, and AGAIN! Till I bear it no more. I will take pictures of this new streak art and post it.   "M'chism" I'll call it. A new lease on life. Do you want to turn back time?

      I have learnt that when something significant happens, something else might happen which just erases what happened before.  Today was the showing of our dance for ITS. I gave it a hundred percent and put a lot of work into it. My efforts were criticized and my words, misunderstood.  I was filled with so much anger and desperation to express the injustice which I had incurred, but now, something more important has happened. I know it seems childish and immature, but it's my world, and if it's true, what she says- that I am a fool, then I'll look back on this someday, and say I was a fool. But till that day comes, if it comes and I hope it never will, I'll hold on.  Zel came online and we had a misunderstanding. This one was really really bad and I was very sad although it was brief. She had told me that she had vented all her anger out on me and asked me to listen to the lyrics of a Chinese song. I was happy that she'd killed me till she couldn't kill me any longer, and I cried when I read the lyrics. I wish she'd told me then. Why I got so sad was because .. how do I put it? Her previous blastings hurt less coz I couldn't fall that far since I was so low. But when she told me that she'd stop, my hope balloon floated higher and now it's burst and fallen far to the ground. That's why I was so upset. The higher you are, the further you fall.  Anyway, she called me after. I was happy to hear her voice. It was the best part of my day. We spoke for a while. All there was, was an expression of sorrow and pleading on my part and angst on her's. I know there's something in there. In her. I have to get it back. I want to believe it so much, that I do. You know, like when you've told a lie for so long that you believe it.  I guess there's nothing much to express. It's all filling me on the inside. But then, I ask myself, what is filling me, and all I can say, is that it's the joy of hearing her voice and the self dillusional hope that somewhere in her, there's a longing too. Then again, I hope the hope is not self-dillusional. It sustains me and without it, I am hollow.  I think I took her for granted. Well, actually, I didn't but I definitely didn't squeeze and treasure the fullest extent possible. I know never to do that again. I was definitely not patient enough. There's a million and one things I would go back to change.  There is hope coz if there wasn't, she wouldn't have called me in the first place. There is hope. Hope is a funny word. It's supposed to be good, but it's like faith. Believing in something that you can't see.  This entry didn't come out as well as I wanted it to. I've waited too long to get to where I am now. Should type when I'm in foreplay of emotion and not in afterglow.  For now, I'll keep cutting myself with the broken pieces of mirror which I'm trying to piece back together. It broke 6months 11 days 22hrs and 45mins ago.

      Wassup. Yesterday was interesting.  Was in school for drama rehearsal. Got cast a small role for the first play we did. I chose to take it positively by reasoning to myself that there were no small roles, only small actors. I wrote that down on the script. I'm so used to saying "score" rather than "script". Jon was cast a nice role. The more I do this, the more I think I suck at it. Okay... maybe not suck... but the inferiority complex is definitely creeping up on me again. This wouldn't be the case if I was in Pioneer or if Zel was around. She gave me life.  Went to see the Potter flick with the drama people.. Steph came along and that made me feel slightly better. Didn't even see Hazel. So yah. It was weird, coz I wanted to although I knew she'd go all out to spite me. Yet, at the same time, I asked Steph along to be my dampener. Why do I hurt myself this way? Sado masochist.  There was a damn tight Goth band, wearing Manson T-shirts save for the lead guitarist who was topless, playing at the blood donation drive stage outside cinileasure when we left. The EQ was just about right too. I didn't really give a hoot about it till I heard the singer hold a solid note. The singer had heavily bleached hair and was definitely albino. Like no melanin content in his skin. He looked like he was the one who needed blood.  We went to Ken's after that. All in all, I've used up a large portion of my week's allowance and will suffer for the next seven days. We ate pizza and had 6 bottles of Corona- at the start. We bummed about a bit more and jammed till about 11.30, then we went for generals at peace centre. We all packed into Eric's car and it was damn close to the road. We did a hundred on the freeways and flyovers with the stereo blasting some techno shat. Groovy. My arm was outside the window and my palm swam against the oncoming air at 100km/h. I chucked the 7-up can outside the window and watched it tumble wildly behind us as we sped away. Close to peace centre, Ken began terrorizing other drivers beside our car with ghoulish noises with his tongue far out of his mouth and his hand showing horns. haha.  Got home at about 1 and bummed about more. Went to the airwell under the bridge and did my first piece of graffiti. The symbol I created out of HZL. Took a snapshot, then returned and had TWO solid, pure shots of J.Walkers, some apricot wine and then another bottle of wine all to myself. Didn't finish the last bottle. It had a nice rose and I'd bet it'd cost a bomb. Was too concerned with what was about to happen next.  We'd been wanting to thrash his neighbour's place for some time now but Ken backed down when the dog-killer drove past the house when we were all on the roof. He knew we were there. I wasn't about to back off so I did it alone. Everyone was very apprehensive and didn't want me to do it. I did it anyway whilst playing a game with myself. Dodging behind cars and jumping into drains to avoid being seen by taxis and home owners. Heart beat was samba as I approached the house quietly. The neighbouring house had a dog sleeping at the front gate. I crept up, assessed the target area and performed the hit and made my way back to the house. Now, why did I do it? For revenge which was not mine to exact or for the thrill?  After that, the guys went upstairs to talk about girls. I remained downstairs, lying on the couch, just... thinking. Remembering.  We were late for service and I, for the first time in a LONG time, intentionally slept in service. I was woken up at the end by a terrible singing of my favourite "as the deer". My face contorted with pain. Went for lunch and then home.  Didn't have as much of a ball as I would have liked to, and I certainty didn't manage to get wasted. Wasted. Ken was afraid I'll hurl all over his place. Well, at least I know I can hold my liquor well. So ends my not so short narrative. Till the next time guys!

      What do I want? What do I not want? Life is like a game of cards, you never know what you're gonna get, but you play your hand as best you can. You know, I was talking about loosing my charisma? I spoke to my friend. She's quirky and knows more stuff than I. Miss Luah's great. I'm still me and I ought not let external circumstances be a definitive factor of my being. I am who I am, just better than who I was and maybe worse at some things as when compares to who I was. So does that mean, I'm the same? My eyes are closing on me.  I've learnt that some parents are over-protective of their children to the extent that it becomes wrong. If a boy defies a teacher's instruction, whether he was in the wrong initially or not, he is in the wrong. The teacher then has the right to reprimand the boy. Over-protective parents dilute  and justify their child's actions and reprimand the teachers for doing their jobs. They should have a "COPS" like show for this. They should call it, "WHEN PARENTS FIGHT BACK".   I'm glad I know right from wrong.  I saw Zel in school on Thursday. Went to say hi to her whilst she was on the payphone calling one of her parents to pick her up. I never really understood that when she had a cellular in her bag. She hardly carries it in her pocket. I like the way it wobbles when we spun it with our fingers. So anyway I said hi and she gave me a look. Her eyes spoke. The windows to the soul say a million things at once. What the hell are you doin here. Don't talk to me. Get lost. Not him again. I want to believe that I'm imagining things. You kinda know that your life sucks when you want to believe that you're wrong.  You know when boy likes girl, boy falls truly madly deeply with girl, boy cant breathe when he sees her or gets hurt by her? She's right, I watch too much TV and live in my fantastical dreamworld. That happened. I saw her look and walked away unable to breathe. Thought about her the rest of the day. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A SIMPLE LOOK DOES THAT TO YOU! WHY!?!?!?  Today too. Yap, Yong, Ken and I went to westmall. We walked into food junction. I was the first. I saw Zel sitting there with her family.  Rachel looked me in the eye. It was SHOCK. It was absurd and weird the way I reacted. It was an immediate reverse. I didn't even stop. I just convulsed backward. Yap saw and told me how adverse my reaction was. To grabbed the boys and said let's not eat here then stumbled outside. WHY DID I DO THAT? Did I not want to disrupt family time? Or make her upset? What! My chest constricted and I couldn't breathe again. It wasn't my chest. It was my heart. That which keeps me alive kills me. Thought about her for the rest of the night too.  Went to see the day after tomorrow. Was good. 3.5 stars. Will watch latest potter release tomorrow with FMSS debate. Weird and I don't belong but Zel's going and Miss Luah asked me to..  Sleep now. Hazel dreams.

      It is important that one is content with what he has. I've been thinking. What's new? If I were to earn $400, I would wish to have myself earn a thousand. And when I earn a thousand, I'd want to earn $4000. But when I earn $4000, though I might have said that I'd be contented with it whilst I was earning $400, I'd still want more. Life's a natural chase whether you like it or not and we're stuck playing the game.  It works the same for various facets of our lives dear reader, be it financial accumulation, points of authority, website hit-counter statistics, material possession or even trivial popularity... why then do we (on a sub-related note) look the gift horse in the mouth?  I am unhappy with the way I was today. The way I still am. TV and Computer... Not good. Have terms coming, haven't started preparing and have a tonne of homework to do. Oh man... I know it's only the start of the holidays, but time's a wastin and I fear I may not have enough time.  Ok, it's getting dry and pointless, or at least, that's the way I feel now. Am only looking forward to Saturday. Going over to Foong's bar to get totally TOTALLY wasted. Apparently the dude's got enough juice to send a rocket toooo the mmmooooonnnn. Will bring camera. Will also be exacting vengeance on the bastard face who ran over Ken's dog...  Haha... Booze and jam all night long. What else could I ask for but her? Will make my debut mark on the "wall of want" too. How we're goin to go to church the next day, I don't know... but what the heck lah... "IRONY SCREAMING IS!!!" (drunk Yoda talk).  Till next time boys and girls. Same time, same channel.

      HELLO! This is going to be an interesting one.  Firstly, I'd like to make it official, Dance is one helluva thang! It's like aerobics, except aerobics doesn't make you feel like a total dipshit. The pre dance "warm up" was boot camp! I'm aching like a monkey's uncle! I was so traumatized! I mean like, the rest have been doing this for some time now, but I've practically never danced in my life except for the PJ mass dance with pretty ice queen Siti with the pretty eyes. So the first time I actually do a dance class, I get thrown into a competition class. Sial lah. Thank goodness for Mrs C! She's so nice! ...and um Raj too... *snigger* *COUGH!* What really sucked is that it cost me like $22 coz it finished 2 hours late and I had to take a cab home ($10) and then a cab to City Hall ($12).  Went for the choir concert last night. It wasn't as good as I'd liked it to have been, BUT agnus dei was great, except for this one little bit where the tenors made a BIG boo boo... to me at least. I gasped and my friend turned and looked at me strangely. On the whole, I'd say, maybe 7.5? Oh well, they're capable of much better, coz from last night's performance, "the arts magazine" was wrong to have said that they're "arguably the best school choir in the land".  After the concert, Wei Xin showed up. I'd paid an extra 21 bucks, had an empty seat and an un-torn ticket in my pocket. At least Caleb Kay, younger by 2 years, had the decency to pay even though he couldn't go, coz he was grounded (which is a valid reason by me). So much for not having the money, time (coz he had to catch up with his studies) or hype (what the hell do I care if he'd broken up with Christina and she was going too?)(Yes Wei Xin, I'm a lit student, I can make inferences and draw parallels, and am trained to argue well and rationally without over excessive incorporation of emotion. Besides, it doesn't really take a rocket scientist). Well, now we know he's real responsible, placing his interests first. I've got plenty of shit lined up waiting to be fired at you man. What have you got other than a thesis statement with no elaboration? But NOOOO, he had better things to do. He went to spend time with his class which loves him dearly and had a twelve dollar dinner. Attempted to smart talk me. I shan't go to the extent of putting the SMS's up here. That's just a last resort if the matter is pursued. I nearly hit him, then decided to walk away. Asked the group to choose between one or two. One was to go back and beat him up, two was to cool it. They chose 1, not knowing what it was. I turned and walked briskly toward him, and they began to shout "TWO! TWO!"... HAHA! So anyway, he with all the class in the world, raised his index finger to my face. I pushed him about a bit. Arthur- that clown came to stop me before I could do anything else. Haiz. I'm glad Arthur was there. Not coz he stopped me from hurting Wei Xin, but coz he stopped me from hurting myself. Thanks man.  I'm not proud of what I did. It was not right. It was impulsive and immature. The situation could have been handled differently if I'd  thought of assuring him that payment need not have been rushed. I did not please the Lord coz I did not forgive him who trespassed against me. I apologized to him later. I think I wish I'd hit him, but then, I think I'm glad I didn't. I ought to apologize to God too. Hazel's going to have a field day with this. Her and her emotional blackmail. They're all alike lah. Why do I still love her? I will think about that and answer soon.  My lips fit the shape of the top of a glass bottle of coke coz I typed out the last paragraph with it "suctioned" to my lips. They taste funny now... haha. I shall do it again.  OK, as for today, I bought a guitar bad for $20, Seng's Aria bass guitar for $130 and a Stratocaster for $240. For those of you who are not familiar with this terminology, "Aria" is a brand name, "Bass" is an electric guitar which produces a very low pitched sound and "Stratocaster" is a very nice make of guitar by "Fender" which is a top guitar brand. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong with anything). After this, we went to collect Seng's new Ephiphone at Holland. I kept hitting my head on the hanging jawstick burner outside the sellers house and intentionally committed the incident to memory to put it up here.  I should start doing my homework tomorrow. If not, I'll be in deep shat... The counter has been up for 2 days now and I've got 50+ hits already. Exellent! People do read! I'll continue sharing my life with you. Inclusive of sporadic periods of pseudo-intellectual thought. Here's me being humble again... Yay! *rolls eyes* There was something else I wanted to say but I forgot. No matter. Good night.  Here's a thought- Man who goes to sleep with smelly butt, wakes up with smelly fingers.

      Maybe for us, they could play our favourite tune. Let's not discuss things we can't undo.  Yes, I'm in one of those moods again. It's sad again. I'm sad again. Drama finished at ten and I got home at eleven. Girls are trouble. Zel's gone, Dawn's gone and Jo's gone.  I'm tired of waiting for Jo. We've only just begun. It's just begun. I'm tired of politics.  It's clear that she doesn't value our friendship. To be frank, she's a liar because to my face she'll tell me that everything's ok. Everything is not ok. Sounds familiar huh. Damn, It's me isn’t it. I'm the commonality.  I saw Dawn today. I wished we'd talk, but I was too afraid. We've become estranged. 10/10 by the judges for screw up score.  Zel was, is and will probably continue to be my motivation. I think about her so much, it's painful. I get angry at myself for clinging to memories. This is not normal. Our anniversary's coming. We won’t do anything. I'll send her a message to which no reply will be made. I know this, but I still hope. What a fool I am. IT happened again yesterday at warm ups for drama. We had to remember the happiest memory we could. Zel was it. I picked the airport and re-lived everything. I felt the cold of the railings, listened to the soft background music, and heard her. What shocked my was the smell of her hair. I swear, it was her hair that I smelt. It was so weird, I looked around to find her, hoping that I would. I'm lying to myself.  Tomorrow is opening night for Moliere. I hope it goes well.

        They turned this draggy play into a semi interesting one. Well, I wouldn't say that it's fantastic now, but it's getting there. I want to work on rhythmics and interjection timings. It's all part of the form. Raeza and Mrs. C worked their magic today, The see things that the rest of us don't. I want to be able to see these things too. It comes with passion and skill. Raeza is now my benchmark in terms of theatrical ability. He's it because he's attainable. Set realistic goals is what we've been taught. By the way reader, Raeza is my ex drama president. I served him ice cream today. It was an honour. Oh man, a step more and I'll be kissing the ground upon which he walks. This is not good. Tim! Wake up.  I need God. I feel empty and sinful.  Jolyn is still the same. I think she's gone too. If she is, our relationship will be depth-less and professional. Hell, professional relationships are warmer than what I've got. And all this why? Because I told the truth about having a life. Yes reader, the world is not fare.  I just woke up after I dosed off halfway through a show. It was about a disturbed psychic. Weird and bloody. Mummy told me about the ending and I didn't feel so bad about dosing off.  I think I might be on to something when I ask you why we are polite. I will ponder and write when it is time.  I've been finishing in school pretty late recently. It's coz of moliere. I'm lethargic in class and can't carry on much longer. Oh, tomorrow is Cheryl's birthday. I chipped in about $20 for her present. I only wish I had the time to go buy it. Many datelines to meet. Am stressed. Want to go to sleep.  There's nothing precious about old people in the cemetery.

      I&nbsp;HAD A GREAT DAY! I'm glad to have friends.   Foong was kind enough to lend me his keyboard amplifies. What's more, he had plans for the day, yet he worked around it to supply my needs. What's more, he was kind enough to accommodate my waking up late. I took the amp home after service and hopped on a train to Sharm's place. I was late coz of church, but they didn't mind.   We ate! Sausages, Salad with cheese (not tofu Leon), Chips with salsa and Sharm's own dip,&nbsp;Mini tomatoes,&nbsp;AND PIZZA! There's not anything better than Pizza and Hazel. Oh and we had ICE CREAM CAKE from SWENSENS! Dried ice and all! And did you know that Ice cream cake is made from actual ice cream? I'm sorry, but I'm terribly deprived of some things. And yes it's embarrassingly&nbsp;true, I'd have never known!   We played! On the swings where I tore the back of my ACJC branded shirt (good on you Mr Swing!). With a deflated basket ball. Touch rugby, monkey, soccer. Let's just say that we're all not the "sporty type". I'm not shy with the UWCers. I can be myself and they like me regardless. Khin, Leon, Shyam, Sharm, Fauzi and I.  I watched them today and was happy that they were happy together. It was A picture out of a movie. A couple comes running up a hill, the girl laughing, followed by the boy and they sit on swings and have a good time. Love is magical and infectious (sorry for the lack of a better word).   Jolyn came, and I fell silent for a good art of about half an hour. I contemplated leaving. I'm nervous around her now. I shouldn't be! Oh! by the way, I've gotten three people tell me that they thought I liked Jo. I do not. Now that that's straight, the second thing I wanna talk about&nbsp; is my use of the word like. It's innocent. Please don't make more out of it than there actually is. Otherwise, you'd be an ACSian. I do not have a crush on&nbsp;Jolyn. The prospect was rather ticklish though. All of us dunked each other in the pool. Leon was a fighter, but in the end, I won.&nbsp;We behaved like children. It was good. I'm sad that things between her and I are not working out.   After this, I went jamming. There's&nbsp; nothing better than Pizza. YES! I HAD PIZZA AGAIN. Aren't&nbsp;I lucky? We played and had fun too. I'm very tired now. Have to sleep. Basically, Jireh, ended a great day by agreeing to stay with the band. It was good. I am pleased.   The second and only regret I have today is that I don't have the energy to complete this blog well. Just know that I am very happy today. Good night.

      Today was ITS. Well actually, it wasn't really&nbsp;called the&nbsp;International Talent Show. It was called SPARKS 2004. Whatever that was. It didnt really make a difference. Shaka Laka's been playing in my head non-stop for the past two days. I even broke out dancing in front of the mrror in the hospital's elevator. Unfortunately, the door opened on the second level whilst I was on my way up to the third and this malay cleaner lady just stared at me, who embarrassed, was caught in an indian pose with my leg on my knee and my hands in an arc above my head. Mind you, the arc was tilted to form a "C".&nbsp;No joke. She probablly thought I was on my way to psychiatrics.  Got wet and very cold at the KAP bus stop. Terrible weather. Got into studio shivering. Did routine warm ups. I didn't like many things about it. I have problems being humble. Maybe it's that. Maybe I'm not used to being the follower. God grant me humility and meekness.  We got on the bus to Ngee Ann and&nbsp;before I got off, I had a flash thought that I might fall off the slippery steps.&nbsp;True enough, I slipped on the last step; and what's worse, I was holding the&nbsp;boom box!&nbsp;Here's the kicker, something in me woke up and I landed on the road with one leg on the&nbsp;ground and the other in mid air balancing me. FREAKING COOL SHIT LAH! I stood like that for about 4 seconds, almost everyone&nbsp;around me looking, and exclaimed triumphantly like I'd proven something to myself, "I'm a dancer! What? You wanted&nbsp;me to fall?" Hahaha!&nbsp;They giggled.  Did a run on the large stage. It was huge and man... I had to move in 8 beats from stage left to right. Retarded! About 20 metres in 4 seconds! Anyway, we didnt really know what to do for the finale, so this British looking chap scolded us and was pretty sarcastic about it. This didn't sit well at all with the Madams and Rae.. They kicked up quite a storm. If you ask me, everything was blown out of proportion&nbsp;by our side. I mean, the guy just made a comment about us not turning up for rehersals with the other groups and told us that we had no idea what we were doing when we were on the stage for the finale. He was right. We didn't, and therefore, his statement was justified. I didn't feel that we were terribly wronged. Maybe it's because I'm pretty forgiving. Maybe it's coz I'm not as proud as the Madams or Rae. Now, don't get me wrong here, I'm not speaking ill of them at all. All I'm saying is that pride is a&nbsp;drama mask. It's pride that blew the matter up ;-( ,&nbsp;BUT it's also pride that brought the matter up ;-). I admire their pride, whether it be for the school or for the company. I like Mrs Creffield. She's a well of wisdom I can learn alot from. Hope to get closer with her.  I liked getting dressed. Shiny purple long pants, sequin-laden vest over a fitting black T-shirt, black socks, black dance shoes, wax, moose, hair spray, fix wild hair, foundation, powder, eye shadow, lip balm, lip gloss, blusher, necklace and bangle and STRETCH!. I&nbsp; simply loved it. Too bad I have to rely on makeup to look good. I think I am vain.  Pre-performance, we were behind curtains in pitch darkness. The UV light made our teeth glow and it was pretty funny. Despite this, with only one green light stick, we slipped into a mode of total concentration. Running the steps simultaneously with the track&nbsp;mentally.&nbsp;This sounds funny, but it was almost ritualistic and spiritual.  Today, I actually performed with the legendary AC dancers. No; today I was&nbsp;an AC dancer, and WE were good.

      I don't need no proof when it comes to God and truth; I can see the sunset.  I miss Jireh. He makes me laugh. Hope you enjoyed yourself Des. We'll be doing Iris, Friends and This love. Hopefully Pan Pac will have the required equiptment. If not, this could be a be a flop. Failure is not an option.  I saw a sex in the city advert today. The line read, "Love is worth waiting for". I Thought of Des, then Zel. I feel bad that I thought of Zel second. I'm being obsessive. And by the way reader, a poet is the only person in the world who'd obsess over whether or not to use "and" "the" and "I". And they in all their&nbsp;airs tell you that your craft needs perfecting.  Tell me then, When will it ever be good enough for you?

      The Hwa Chong gang made me happy. I saw them at SYF today. That's all it took. That's friendship!  ACJC is not about friendship. I entered with the intenton to nail my A's and get out. I lost track of that and started longing for friends. No man is an island. I don't wanna be an island. I've got Leon, and Pang and my Feirfield friends and my CAPpers and my Pioneers and my UWC'rs to fall back to. I forgot why I didn't want ACSians. They swear, cheat, lie, bicker and brag. I don't want to become like that. You can take your excusivity and shove it.  I'll stick, but&nbsp;I'll keept a few though.

      I walked down the hospital corridor yesterday. It didn't smell of antiseptic. I don't think it even smelt of anything actually. Today too! Leon was there. He's good to me. I like him.  &nbsp;  Tata lay on the bed. He looked bad. I went over to his side, held his hand and sat down. His eyes were half closed. NO! They were half open and from the moment I got into the room, I saw the trembling. He couldn't hold me very firmly, but it was good enough to let me feel his weakness. Each time, his hand pulsed in mine, the more and more upset I got. I asked to be excused to go to the toilet. I went out to cry.  &nbsp;  He's been diagnosed with pneumonia and they've been jabbing him with needles every day and his legs are thin. He's not eating I think, coz he's trying to reduce his stomach size. It's bloated for some unearthly reason. So I sat there holding his hand and he trien to turn over to kiss me and we were all like "nonono... wait.. get rid of the thermometer first". I was the first to see his temperature. 40.1 degrees. That's brain damage level boys and girls. I was so damn scared I tell you. He spoke in a weak voice and called me Vairam, then Ian, then Timmy. I never realised how much that meant to me. I might even tell you why another day.  &nbsp;  One thing ticked me off. The fact that&nbsp;Daddy showed up was nice, but then he started telling Tata about how he was rushing a New Creation Pastor to come down to see Tata. I mean DAMMIT! Stop shoving this stuff down his&nbsp;throat lah! I was embarrassed. Not of The Lord, but of the way Daddy thought.&nbsp;Dammit! He's not going to die! He can't!&nbsp;I prayed later, watching my words, whilst everyone stood over him. Midway, he said in a warm, weak tone, "heh, thank you raja". He calls me "Raja". It's "King"&nbsp; in Tamil. I knew he was happy. Thank you Tata.  &nbsp;  I went back down today after drama and dance which ended by 7.40pm. I can expect this figure to rise in the ensuing eleven days. I've been having a&nbsp;level&nbsp;7 cold today! Abysmal thing makes life miserable.&nbsp;I turned the corner and&nbsp;he saw me and smiled and I knew things were better. His grip was better and his movements wer'nt as painful to watch. Thank Jesus! I held his hand a bit more today and felt better about things. I know it's serious but it doesn't seem that way to me. I wonder what being in shock is like. I think things are on the upswing, but there's thing in me that prompts me, every now and then to think about the worst. I have to convince myself that everything's going to be alright.  &nbsp;  Cheryl- Sarah Lee didn't come to school today. I'm not in love with her. There's something about Cheryl. Something that I've not seen enough of in the past few days. Maybe it's her smile, or the brown rubber band she uses to tie her hair. I look for it to find her during assembly sometimes. Maybe it's her laugh. It's an honest laugh. You don't hear many honest laugh's anymore. Listen.  &nbsp;  Yes, this girl's pretty special if you ask me just because she's sprightly. She makes me hapy. But she's fizzed out a bit recently. Some thing might be wrong. And it's sad. Even in a SMS, you'd feel her through it. Is the aura. Anyway love, if you're reading this, pause, know that you're loved by many, assess what's wrong, and lean not on your own understanding. There's no problem too big, God cannot solve it. And by the way, I've got major issues when it comes to family relationships. It's just not reflected in my life. It probablly is here though. So if you, or anyone else reading this needs someone to talk to, Tim's your man.  &nbsp;  Tim's your man and that's my personal invitation to you reader. We know each other and I don't believe in shallow relationships. I've been through family issues and I know a thing or two about what it's like to have abuse, and disintegration of various ties abounding. Shall not go into too much detail here, but the base line is that if you need anything, gimme a call or send me an email.  &nbsp;  I know I'll not get a call, I'm not expecting one for a&nbsp;seemingly cheap promise on a blog validated by words.&nbsp;But when you feel all alone and the world has turned it's back on you, gimme a moment please, to tame your wild wild heart.  &nbsp;  Oh! And please keep praying for Tata.

      I just found out that Tata's been admitted in SGH. I am very very very distraught right now. I don't even know what's wrong. OH GOD! Apparently he's fallen twice. The first time, was below his house and someone had to pick him up. And the second time, was after his lunch yesterday and my Pati couldn't even get him up! OH GOD! And he's been down with a high fever for the past 2 days and he's been shaking and shivering and all! OH GOD!!!!  &nbsp;  I FEEL LIKE CRYING! He's my family and he brought me up and he's NEVER been mad at me! HE walks me down when I go to his place and puts me in the cab home. I kiss him when I see him and I kiss him when I part. I'm never afraid to hold his hand. When I was little, he quit smoking for me and stopped drinking too! This is all the tip if the iceberg! Oh God! He's 70 and I proposed a toast at his and Pati's birthday. That they&nbsp;be with us&nbsp;for a long time more.  &nbsp;  I won't be going for the Rashammon showing at FMSS tomorrow. I'm gona rush down to SGH. I know I shouldn't be along this train of thought right now, but it is and I can't help it. Oh God! And what's more, with what's happened to Zel's granny and Eric's mum and ARGH! I can't help thinking about it.  &nbsp;   Pray friends. For his health and salvation. The latter being the priority. Have to have intercession before it's too late.

      I have been ill with writer's block for the past couple of days, and hence, the short, content impaired and elaboration-less entries. I think that the sky has cleared.  &nbsp;  Yesterday and today were special and I have learnt. Well actually, I just fought with my mother and I'm off centre, but I'll try to make this one good. On a slightly more trivial note, I decided to call yesterday, innuendo day simply because of the antics which my geography lecturer performed. He got the ball rolling when he hinted that he nearly said "bra". Being rather tickled, he slid into sporadic giggles. Yong Xi made it worse for the last row coz the lecturer was talking about erosion and he was like "the more you rub your rocks, the smaller they grow" and Yong Xi was like "are you sure?". That totally cracked me up! The lecturer kept talking about round rocks and about rubbing them&nbsp;and this was unfailingly accompanied by his hands forming&nbsp; individual cups at his chest. What a queer man.  &nbsp;  I have been observing. The people in my school, generally, don't listen enough. Everyone's the one who're right and has to be heard. 10/10 for self confidence - I'll give 'em that. And the gossip and the politics - urgh. And to know what my friends partake from the same sustenance - double urgh. I think I think too much. But that's a good thing. Reading your environment helps you. It's like a cheat code which lets you see obstacles even before they stare you in the face, in a computer game.  &nbsp;  Drama practice today was bad. I can't bring the humor in the scholar and the Vicomte out. I've got people coming to watch the play and I don't want to disappoint them. The nights of the 30th and 31st will be the proving grounds. To peers, audience, Madams and myself.  &nbsp;  After that, I went to Chinatown to conduct a drama workshop for children. There were the naughty ones, so I played a little&nbsp;game of "lets see who can do the most push ups and sit ups" with them. That got them tired. A 7 year old swore at me in Hokkien and ran off too! We hopped about like rabbits&nbsp;and&nbsp;spiderman. I love children. I dig children and dogs. That sounded terrific didn't it. The people who I was working with and the staff of the establishment commended me on my ability to work with them well. ACDC drama night was next. It was good. Humor was predictable and dances&nbsp;were amateurish, but they made me laugh a lot and I think it was well done.  &nbsp;  Last night. I went to Fairfield's production. It was alright. Things are improving between Zel and I. Kai Wei tells me not to push things. He is right. She needs her space. But I of all people should know her love is magic. I stood ouside the pet shop today watching. We used to go there on sundays just to watch the love birds. I want to move, but I don't want her to get pissed. Funny part is that she knows how I feel and she doesn't blast me for it. I am happy because of that. I wanted so desperately to get ont the bus she boarded, but I couldn't do it.  &nbsp;  For now, I can just hope.

      Hello.   Uneventful day too. Got a very sweet postcard from Tiffany from CAP. I can't find it anywhere now and that's really pissing me off. I've turned my bag inside out thrice now and gone through each page in each book and I still can't find it. It's important! I have to go to school early tomorrow morning to look for it about the drama area. Or maybe in the class cupboard. I shall write back.  Tomorrow is blood donation day.   As of now, my poetic veins are dry. I've been bled too many times in the past few days. I'm afraid I'm losing my edge. I'm in trouble. Have to finish the ode to my school bag! I tried today, but it wouldn't come!  Very worried.

      It's funny. There isn't anything to write about tonight. But reader, I am quite stressed. I have assignments calling to me from the abyss of my school bag but I'm sitting here for hours on end, idling my time away. I have a GP test next week which I haven't even begun reading for. I have to finish a presentation on "The experiences of war" by tonight coz the draft's up for vetting by tomorrow- thesis statement and all. I have to finish my "An ode to the school bag" as soon as possible coz the dateline for YAWP (HCJC poetry competition) is on the 19th. Moliere is coming up on the 30th and 31st and I'm struggling to sell tickets. I have to go through "Market structure" again.  It's good, this blogging. Keeps things in perspective.  Han and Nurul came over today and experienced GOOD 'OL AC CULTURE! HURRAH! Bloody school. I'm embarrassed to be here. All that glitters isn't gold. Talking about blood, I'll be donating on Friday. Looking forward to it. Chill out time with metal in arm.  To God be the glory. I passed my Geog exam. Which is like a WOW! Pretty fluke-ish if you ask me. But I'm grateful nonetheless. Is that one word? And I SCORED A WONDERFUL 31 MARKS FOR TAMIL TOO! Out of a hundred. HAhahahaa!  I'm falling back where religion is concerned. Have to alter this distressing course. And I HAVE TO GET CRACKING ON THE BIG BAND GIG ASAP!!!  Keep me in prayer... Whatever truth there is in that.

      A day's got many interesting parts about it. Mine do.  Yesterday, Zhu's classmates and I played with melting chocolate cake and the wall about 7 meters away. My econs teacher mocked honkies to their faces in the lecture and the episode gave me a good laugh. And in the evening, a girl fainted and drama practice was cancelled because of that. But the highlight of my day was definitely after school.  I went back to Fairfield to get tickets to "The silly little girl and the wise old tree". Walked towards Miss Luah's class and found her not there. That's not the point. I turned about to go back towards Joe in the canteen and I saw Zel on the corridor. I wasn't as scared as the last time, but I was still very worried. You know the way many thought's zip through your mind when you're shocked. I was calmer, but still worried that she'd give me the "what the hell are you doing here?" look.  She saw me too. She smiled. Everything was alright just then. If I had to trade this whole week for those four seconds, I would. She smiled at me! Things are looking up. She actually talks to me civilly now. I'm so so so happy. We sat at the same table with Joe. She laughed and smiled and was happy. I was happy. I miss the way she tries to tell her story whilst she laughs. I miss the way she laughs, the way she smiles. I am thankful that things are picking up slowly. She hasn't fully warmed up to me yet, but I was a dumbass in my decision and I suppose I deserve it.  Did exercise in school. Realised that I can't do pull-ups any more. I don't understand why. So I ran about 9 rounds and did a few push ups instead. I watched the play today. It was pointless, but it was good to see how my juniors there are doing. Gave practical criticism to the teachers and helped them close shop at the end if it all. It's technically and setting-wise impressive, but I think it's more of a literature type play. Will watch it again on Friday.  I say again; if I could trade my week just to see her smile again, I would. It's that important to me.

      Hello! Mummy stumbled across my blog today. She wasn't happy with what I wrote about the Indians. I was not polite to her about it but she was calm and still explained it to me like I was 5 years old. I miss the simplicity of 5 year olds. I miss the shelter.  Peter Pan was wise!  Daddy called me after I spoke with Mummy and he spoke to me about the Indian thing too. THAT MEANS THAT MUMMY AND DADDY TALK! THAT'S GREAT!!! Daddy told me never to look upon suffering without compassion. THAT'S SPIDERMAN MATERIAL MAN! My father is wise. It's just that he behaves like a lunatic. But under the joker that he currently is he's wise and I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm proud he's my Dad! Sure he says scarring things and does even more scarring things, but I know he loves us and that's what counts if you ask me. Judge a person by who they are now, not who they were. Some would say don't judge at all. I say bullshit (till I learn better) coz I have my say too.  About what he said, it's funny, looking back on my day. I had to go to the police station to make a report about a "lost card" on behalf of Dr. Ali. I was fully aware that he was using me, but I did it anyway. Ho. So there were people talking to the cop on duty. I squatted with literature in hand in front of a post box. It was dusk. About 3 meters to my left, there was a senile old man talking to himself and across the road was the kindly-looking old lady that didn't speak, but asked for money. I had dinner with Pati, Yi Peng and Yap yesterday. Pati told me that the old lady'd buy liquor with her nightly collection. There's so much hurt, pain and suffering greater than our's about us friends. Just look. Maybe what Daddy said might be of use to you.  Thought a lot about a friend today. I remembered things. A sidetrack from war literature. It doesn't feel right inserting it here. I'll tell you right now instead. Ask me what I remembered. I'll keep it for some time it'll have more of a lasting impact. I'm learning to use my material selectively.

      It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, but it's raining and it's cool. I'm looking out my window listening to Runga's "drive". There is a wet breeze sprinkling on my face and I'm leaning on something closing my eyes. It isn't dark out, but there are raindrops on the window and I'm thankful for that. Right now; I am at peace. I want this to last for the next two hours.  It's funny how we sometimes get what we wish for, but in a slightly different way. I'm lucky today I suppose. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me down to lie in pastures green, the quiet waters by.  Yesterday was funny. Spent the whole day at the youth park. Was supposed to be henna drawing and body painting, but that didn't work out coz I can't draw a proper circle. I did publicity work and read Journey's end instead. Met Anand, the UWC boss man, and I was happy to see him. He's sincere I should think. I saw Leon Toh yesterday and that made me happy too. I miss him and it's sad. This whole happy sad thing is bitter sweet in reverse. Khin came by and I was real happy to see her too. She looks great as ever. Truly someone to be happy for. Leon and her were walking and I was happy to see them happy. I watch couples walk by sometimes and I think about Zel and it makes me sad but yesterday was different. I guess it's coz I love them. Was happy for Laura and Chris too. Met up with Shyama and Fauzi too. They're not going out, but they should. I admire their platonic ways.  Did crazy things yesterday. Suddenly stopped and screamed in the middle of a walkway at orchard. Crawling under imaginary barriers in public. I used to do that with Jolyn. I'm not sure what things are between us now. Mixed signals. Maybe I'm making it out to be more than it really is coz my mind's always in hyperdrive. Makes me a bit of a paranoid android.  We walked alone to the MRT station and she said goodbye as she boarded the train. I tried to look at her but I couldn't really. It's like the movies. I think I smiled and nodded at her, but I can't be sure. I was around Dawn the whole of yesterday but we didn't even say hi. It's awkward huh. I suppose I should be thankful though, coz I've only got 3 people that I'm sad about.  Sitting by the window is a bad thing sometimes coz I begin to think about Zel. Then again, is it really a bad thing? All I've got left of yesterday is a peeling, black, white and grey "thinker?" on my right fore-arm. It'll be like this for the rest of my life.

      Today, there was a freaking Indian Zoo in my living room. I was damn shit pissed sick about my sister bringing those things home when mummy expressedly said not to. THE BLOODY WHOLE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY. Baby, mother, 2 brothers and a sister and there was this short pudgy animal-like thing that kept running about, I think he's got an under devoloped mind or something.. the queer way he acts, man... Looking at me like I'm a pissin' caged attraction. Then, there were these other 2 clowns, a cousin and her boyfriend I think. DYSFUNCT SHIT MAN! I'm damn pissed about her socialising with all of them DAILY.  THIS IS GOING TOO FAR! I think my parents should stick my sister in a home of delinquent girls or something. Today's feat was a new trick that we havn't see our cunning little fox pull. Just adding laurels to the cirriculum vitae I suppose. And mind you reader, that this is the latest incident of shit that's been going on for about 2 weeks now. HELL! SHE'S REVERSING MY FAMILY'S RECOVERY COURSE LAH.  And get this! The eight circus animals which my sister brought over hadn't eaten their dinner and come over for food. WHAT THE DIPSHIT IS THIS PLACE? A FREAKING FAST FOOD JOINT AH? Bloody hell! NOW MY HALL SMELLS OF INDIAN!!! shit lah!  I just stayed in the room and played my guitar, man. I'm beginning to think that it was a mistake to have bought the bass, but what the hell...  Bloody backward people. TRUST ME READER! YOU KNOW SHIT. MY ANGER IS JUSTIFIED.   How would you like your living room to smell of Indian?

      "Drive" by Bic Runga is good for me. I need to be quiet now. To just stand still on a cold morning my eyes shut. No, to be sleepy on a grassy hill the breath coming over you, warming you, cooling you. I want to sit by a window watching the sun set through the drops on the glass. No, I want it to be dark out. Let me be sleepy and let there be a soft couch. Let her sing me to sleep. I want one more thing. You to be there holding my hand.  Drama today was a waste of time and I got ticked coz I observed them. I'm full of skepticism. It's my fault. I want to be simple, to be stupid, not to notice you in the corner playing chess with yourself. I think I know you.  Jo's still cold. This hurts. Let rain fall from concrete coloured skies. The more we keep this up, the further we'll drift apart. I don't think telling the truth all the time is a good thing. I tell it as it is and I hurt. I lost that which comes before sunrise and now Jo's going too.  I want a good body and T-shit weather.

      Am extremely pissed at many things. My computer really got to me last night. I wrote a perfectly good entry for this blog, and I hit spell check and the bloody thing hung, taking all my work to hell. Bitch.  I was walking out of school with Joel and we were talking about how much love hurts. We as teens think our world is the world.  We know shit. There was this lady we met on the bus. I know about her because of one of my juniors. She was talking very loudly to everyone on the bus. She was driven nuts coz of bitter divorce proceedings. Love's damage extends far beyond the boundaries of thump thump lub dub emotion. Like I said, we teens think we've got it bad.  We know SHIT.  I'm pissed coz I'm getting dissed by Jo. It's sad. I tell the truth and I get dissed. Sound familiar? Maybe it's just girls. Hell! What is it with the I'm-going-to-be-pissed-at-you-because-I-wish-to-express-my-discontent shit man?! I don't understand it!  On a happy note, Leon almost got into the finals for his swimming competition. He missed it by only 1.something seconds. Good on him ay! What the hell is he not good at?  Dance was on today. I hate dance but I have to learn. It will help me impress judges.  I'm sorry that tonight's entry is sub-standard reader. I'm not having a good time.

      I tolerate those who I love and have little patience for non good first impression givers. That is a bad thing. School begins in the morning. It's going to be odd. And so, survivor begins again. The difference is, that this time, I'm not going to give a damn about playing.  A poem requires danger or death to be successful.  Jolyn is still angry at me and I'm very upset about that. She's not answering my messages or calls. This sucks. I really don't want this to turn out like the conventional saga. I love Jolyn.  It's almost not funny to write about this anymore after the last paragraph, but I'll do it anyway. Just that it won't be funny. I got splashed by spluttering oil at the steam-boat today and I exclaimed "BISMILlAH" out of the blue. (Pardon me my Muslim buddies). It WAS rather funny though. Also, we got a bad position, and I happened to be getting the brunt of the chain reaction. Food cooks --> smoke is produced --> smoke rises --> smoke suffocates sandflies attracted to bright light above my seating position --> extra protein in my food and drink (yummy).   Astro and I then proceeded to burn the food we couldn't finish so that we wouldn't be charged for wastage and we walked back to the MRT station for the next 20 minutes. We picked up big sticks which had fallen off the trees with the initial intention of them being protection from the wild dog packs (the road was dark and lonely you see). HOWEVER, being ASTRO AND MYSELF, coupled with our fascination for TERRORISM (which ONLY arises in me when we are together), we turned the protective sticks (about 1.5m in length) into guns. We hid beind bushes and jumped out at oncoming cars wielding our large sticks (ok. That sounded wrong) yelling in Arabic- sounding Xena the warrior princess like shrieks. It was liberating and I was happy. And on the LRT home, we intentionally had a heated, VERY AUDIBLE conversion about how things were "not working out" & about how "he's found someone else" and that we should "break up". OH my GOSH! You should have seen the look on the other passengers faces! I really miss hanging with Astro.   I got off the train with a soft caress from him which I reciprocated with great pleasure.

      Hey reader, it's late and I'm tired. Today was interesting. Went to church and did the whole ritualistic thang again. Oh, but the terrible singer girl is getting better. :)  Anyway, we went to orchard where I refused to see spiderman again. Instead, I fruitfully utilized my time by taking Angeline and Megan to Paragon to get their eyebrows plucked. It was entertaining- watching Megan's pretty face cringe to resemble a hamster cleaning itself and Angeline jump with shock. Conclusively, they were "happy".  Yap and Angeline came over and we played with the new amps and stuff. Walked her to get her mail from her place and then back again. I enjoy her company and we had peanut butter waffles.  Later Leon asked me to go over to his place so that we could go for dinner at Holland V. I got mama (uncle) to send me to Leon's. Brought along his police sign present. Remember the one that I picked up with Dawn a couple of months ago. It wobbled making metallic wobbling noises which sent Fonzie (the Golden Retriever) into a "woah-what's-that-noise" mode. His head was moving in the oddest fashion and his ears picked up and his face almost asked you a question! Hahaha! He was so cute! Fonzie has motion sickness you see, so in the car, I was trying to keep him from puking by attempting to keep him entertained. I did many silly things which I will not mention here. In the end he didn't puke, I reached Leon's and all was well.  Gave Leon the gift and was thanked with smirk and an "ass". Haha! We went to Brekos where he entertained me with his stories of the commonwealth man. And there was this malay kid with the biggest eyes! I love him! We bought corona and left. We talked, toasted and um.. I can't think of another verb that starts with "T" right now.  I'm tired. Good night.

      Wassup Babies! I'm at the youth park now. Just got into a lot of crap in school but will fill you in on that after I fill you in on this. Am I supposed to be filling YOU in on this? I started this with the initial intension (alliteration) of it being an avenue of self expression and examination- (alliteration again). BUT! One thing I've learnt at CAP is that WE the writers write for YOU. So, bon appetite mon ami.  There's a lot to say. Firstly, about CAP (the camp I was at for the last week of the holidays). Well, if I'd blogged about it straight after the camp, I'd have so many intuitive things to say. Unfortunately, procrastination breeds memory loss. What I can remember is that I know I've come out a better person. This is the catch- I was the same person when I went in. So what happened inside was that I realized that I retained my value as a person. I'm still as funny, and I still know what my rights are, and I'm still able to fight for them. I'm who I was before, but better in the sense that I'm wiser about social interaction (hard knock lessons from college). The sad Tim's dissolving and The generally entertaining one's back. That's not all there is to me, but I'm happy that that facet of my being is back.  The people at CAP were great! They were friendly, open, and swore a lot less than the "Christians" at school. Have come out with many good friends. Denise, JJ, Nigel, Han, Jia Chuan, Wei Liang, Zealyn... Just to name a FEW mind you. I've met Jia Chuan again after 2 years and Zealyn again after about 11 years. Woah... yes... tell me about it. For those of you who are reading this and have not had your names mentioned, you are still on my mind. Babirusa, JC Drama, and all the other neat people I've met along the way.  The camp started out draggy, but it picked up along the way. I got closer and closer with my peers and got many commendations at the end. It made me a new person, or rather, the old person. Whatever lah. Oh! I was put into this workshop with a HIPPY art teacher. Damn man! "Feel the energy of the plant and connect with it. Feel the beautiful flow of connectivity children." And that's only the tip of the iceberg. I got put into another workshop. The drum clinic was definitely the best thing that happened to me there. Made friends with Kenny Hogan, one of SEA's best drummers. He had my mouth open. He asked me to do a solo gig with him on stage for the dinner, and I was like... wow.. and then we were talking outside and I told him that I was a singer and that I wanted to make entertainment my career and he asked me to sing on stage whilst he drummed. I was like *BLOWN AWAY*. I called Leon who was in M'sia and asked him for fever lyrics. AND ALL THIS WAS LIKE 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE GIG! WE DIDN'T PRACTICE, but the funny part about it was that I wasn't particularly concerned about that. Went up, did fever with one of the best drummers the region had to offer. Just the two of us. SURREAL! The audience LOVED it. Then the drumming bit came. Nigel was on the cowbell, I played snare and he played the set. AND IT FLOWED DAWG!!! Was commended many times after that with "wow Tim, didn't know you were so good". I was like what?! and I said thank you. OH MY GOSH READER! I'M SORRY, BUT I'M EXCITED THINKING ABOUT IT.  Babirusa was my group name. We were supposed to be called "the eleven and a half apostles" but we decided to scrap that and take control. We put on a little skit about the excursion we had at the night safari. It was mediocre, but that's because all the rest of the groups had the same ideas and memories. None the less, I love my babirusa! (Btw, babirusa is the name of the pig thing at the night safari. We were entertained my it, so we adopted it's name). JC Drama started out slow. I have learnt the magic of sound- scapes and tableaux (is that how you spell it?). Made many friends with the Hwa Chong'ers there. They're great... most of them. Pretty people. Miss them to death. I got put into this artsy thing where 4 girls and myself created the poem (below - Rythms of nature) from our individual poems and put movement to it. It was hard working with the girls coz some were you know... inhibited... but that's alright. It was great working with lovely people like themselves. The other two groups which were in JC drama put on very entertaining pieces from very boring scripts. CHEERS TO YOU GUYS! Hats off... really. I can only hope we stick together, but then again, year after year, everyone hopes for the same thing. Pre-u sem or cap.. the numbers will dwindle. The inevitable is inevitable. There are so many things to write about but I've covered the 3 things I wanted to cover. However, no vast amount of writing will ever do true justice to what I wish to express. My gratitude, sentiments and love overwhelm me currently. I feel sad that I can't write about everything. So many people, I miss the way we used to play with Khalwat patrol. We were so desperate to study, that Han, Bernie and I snuck tot he toilet to study. But we were caught there too... so we had to go back to sleep. I was really inspired my them. I want to start writing seriously. It's in me I think and I can hope to become better at it.  The exams are finally over and I'm chilling these few days. Developments on love front. I've decided that it's too dangerous to like anyone, so I won't coz it will turn out badly in the end. Sad. I know.  Joe just played sacrificial lamb for me. She's getting blasted in school. Thank you Jo. I'll call you tonight. I'm upset that this had to happen but I have my own life and drama's going to have to realize that, but they won't coz things are going to have to be done their way. I mean, they can't contact you the night before and expect you to change your plans just when you've just finished your exams! THAT'S RIDICULOUS! Unfortunately, that's the way it is there. I thought things would change when I joined drama... I was wrong. ACJC's ACJC wherever you are weather you like it or not. I'll just have to deal. At least I know that I'm not inapt ont he social front. It's just  some  of my classmates who are jackasses. And if you're one of them and you're reading this and you're not happy, lets get it on then.  Till the next entry then. I'll be telling you about the things I learnt at CAP as well as other great stuff about the 1AA1'ers. Later.

      Hats off to the girls who did this with me. Willing to do the gig or unwilling to do it. Inhibited or uninhibited. Teachable and held. I love the four of you.   Rhythms of Nature   Gun still smoking when the hoof beats stop 5000 species of birds and no sound Cacophony of insects in the evening and birds at 6am And at 6pm The tenor song of frogs on rainy nights  Rainy nights. Rain The sound of rain on a windowpane The smell of yesterday's showers To know that every puddle is meant to be stepped in The shimmering sound of fairies drying their wings  Their wings. Rustle of leaves, small stirrings, in trees The way flowers bloom and fall to the ground. Blossoms on the grass Stupid weeds that refuse to be pulled out Stupid flowers that die too easily Grass under your shoes  Under your shoes. Footsteps on gravel Steps on leaves Step Step Step Step Step on the Ant! Fading footsteps in a gloomy morning  Morning. Breathing Heartbeat Tribal music, jungle beat Rhythms, drums, music, beat, STOMP! The dark primitive dance that lasts throughout the night but disperses into little shattered fragments at dawn,  running, hiding, seeking  Seeking. Love Marriage Children Growing up LIFE! The thump thump of my heartbeat, The thump thump of yours

      I have a few things to say today.  I am not tired and will be working throughout the night again. Yes.. well, but that's not what I wanted to say. Too many Singaporeans, especially the youth, complain about Singapore. Lets talk local. I am local. I complained and mocked the system. Sure there may be faults within our political system, but which country is an exception to this? Faultlessness is an impossibility where mortals are concerned. Singapore, for most of us is all we know. ALL... that we know to be home. Too many times have we seen snazzy journalists with their ironic wit scoff at and mock the government subtly. Too many times has the older generation done the same. Our parents, grandparents, Gen-X. Would you pick a fight, or find fault with your parents to look cool coz your older brother was doing it? It's the same thing.  This is my call. That we edify instead of tear down. Sure, an individual won’t destabilize the government. But many ants can lift the elephant. Let's not mock our Government and it's policies unless we have genuine reason. And even then, there are appropriate avenues to voice our discontent. I've said it once, hell, I've said it a few times. You never know the value of something till you lose it. Friends and countrymen, we have good governance. Treasure it.  Now, the next thing is something that I'm really fired up about. NDP was good. The commentators, especially the male had no idea what he was talking about. He was rambling. The "choir" was actually a dance troop and the script was ridiculous. Come on! The golden bird-men coming onto the field was an indication of how Singapore was a high flying country? And a couple of soldiers shifting from a standing position to a kneeling position in a wave was an indication of how we work together harmoniously? I mean, at LEAST link the repeated Singaporean catch phrase to the appropriate formation. I must qualify however, that the NDP was valuable. Yes. It gave me a good laugh.  IDOL! ARGH! TRASH! BULLSHIT!  Dick Lee, well, he's just a dick. The girl has the freaking lamest, driest humor around. And the dude sitting at the end of the table? Shit man, he's so freaking stoned, if I hit him with a stick, he wouldn't look any worse or more dead. And you know what he said to the overly emotional nervy-crying girl? "Don't worry, there's all the time under the earth.". UNDER THE EARTH? HE SHOULD FREAING BE FREAKING UNDER THE FREAKING EARTH! That's an UNFORGIVABLE linguistic error on the part of a judge. And what was that about the maat having an attitude problem? Bullshit man. He sang well. What's YOUR PROBLEM? A couple of judges behave like they've got a cactus up their ass, the way they behave. Dick Lee? He's got a dick up his ass. He was soooo totally jacked by that dude with the flower. He was like "You're lucky that that flower on your jacket's artificial coz if it were real, it would have died". And the dude went "but the flower IS real" to which an embarrassed  dick  made a  small  attempt to save his  skin  by qualifying, "oh... no wonder it looks  bent ". BBBAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Dick got jacked. Fool.  Olivero dissed me the least. I hope there's hope in him. If not, the panel's just made up of a flopping dick, a barren bimbo, a has-been rockstar, and a linguistically deficient zombie.

      It's almost 3 am. I have done nothing except sleep and eat the whole of yesterday. Hell, I don’t even know if i did the eating part. I hate this feeling. Homework tells you to do it, but I just can't get down to doing the bloody thing. God!  I will not sleep!  I read Wei Xin's blog. He's a good writer. Good vocabulary with furious expansion of wit. Wonderful. Emotional. I read an article about me. It was when we fought. It wasn't nice. I felt hurt and pissed at hollow accusations and interpretations of my life. I don't hold it against him though I really hope he clears things up with his readers. It's defamation liable for legal prosecution. Hell, I'm liable coz I threatened to clout him a stiff one. Everyone makes mistakes. OOo.. I found another one. Boy! haha... This is bugging me though I don't know why.  I want to ask a question. Why do we say please? It's not a necessary part of our vocabulary. A sentence would function perfectly without it. The answer people have given me to this question is "because it's polite". Sure, but why do we need to say please to be polite? "Please" is not an emotion like "sorry" or "thank you". Sorry or thank you are expressed as a genuine emotional response. Please on the other hand is a tool, which is used to get what one wants. It's a game. How many times have we been asked, or have we heard someone being asked, "what's the magic word?" to which a quick or angsty "please" is produced?. We say please when we want something. I discussed this with Leon, who got well... flustered. Many replies, but none answered my question. "Because it is. That’s the way we're brought up. That's the way people have been brought up for a long time. Because it's polite."  "Please" is like playing politics. Do what is necessary to achieve the desired outcome. Why can there not be a mutual understanding by humans to accept and comply without first imposing unnecessary regulatory hindrances like "please". Bloody five-letter-word. Do I really have to ask you with a "please". What do you gain or lose from it's presence or absence respectively, in a string or words? Nothing. Self-satisfaction in some cases where the one who utters the word is seen to acknowledge his subordinacy. Cheap thrill if you ask me. Why is it polite to say "please". Who dictated this mandate? It is because it is? Like God?  Can I have a lollypop vs Can I please have a lollypop. Yes? Latter sounds nice? Sure. Why? BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE'VE BEEN TRAINED. But why have we been trained this way? Why has nobody asked this question before? Or why has nobody given due attention to a child who asks the same question. "Mummy, why do we need to say please?" Green doesn't have to have a reason to be called green. It could be called "yomama" for all I care.  I have an answer. Leon is a genius. I can't remember how he gave it to me, but I took it an expounded on the notion. Patience. Patience is the answer to why we say please. I'll bet that right now, you're positive I've flipped. First I ask unnecessary questions. (highly oo-liao). Then I have a ridiculous answer to a ridiculous question. Trust me, it works somehow. I have to prove it to myself too coz it's far fetched but I have to have an answer to this burning question. It's one of those things that needs closure no matter what. OK.  Patience is the answer to why we say please because... um.. because.. Ok, patience in undeniably a vital aspect of our being right? People with patience deficiencies have tough lives. People need to take a chill pill once in a while. So lets talk in terms of lollypops. The lollypop man is used to having kids ask him "politely" for lollypops with 20 cents in hand right? He does his job. Now, Tim comes along and says "can I have a lollypop". The lollypop man's not happy coz Tim wasn't polite, but he doesn't kick Tim's butt coz he exercises patience. Now, he wouldn’t have to exercise patience if the other kids didn’t say "please" and please wasn't normalcy. Coz then, everyone'd just go "Yo man, gimme a stick wit a cherry head so i can pop it in my mouth to lick and suck. I enjoy it". (YES! WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT LOLLYPOPS). And the lollypop man would be perfectly obliged to concur. So you see, no "please" no need to exercise patience. Sure, there are other ways to exercise patience but the key word here is exercise. That is; practice. Like math. Need practice to get good at it. I've convinced myself coz I want to. And I think I've done a reasonable job or trying to convince you too. umm...  I'm going to sleep now. It's 430 in the morning. I have to finish my essays. Have to finish essays... have to .. finish..................................................

      Hello. Yesterday was great. Met the CAP gang and that was glorious. I am happy when I'm with them. We went for the afternoon of poetry and music at RJC. It was elitist and I didn't know what I was getting myself into. But, I did get inspired to write as I listened to some of the stuff there. It's a waste that I've forgotten the inspiration but at least I know that it's not beyond my grasp. I know what's wrong with my blog now. It's that I recount my daily activities so much that I've left no more room for my other writing. It's become a common blog. Nothing overly special about it. It's like this. I figure that my thinking deserves a special entry coz I want it to have an impact on you. And I know I cannot achieve that if it comes after my groaning over Jolyn or Zel. Not that they're any less important though. Oh, by the way, note to self : Tim, get over your anger at Jo's anger at you. Yes. Now that that's cleared up, I've decided that I should have less recount, more reflection- unless of course, there's something special that needs to be mentioned.  I just found out that Desiree knows Chris because they're old family friends. The bigger we get, the smaller our world becomes huh. Also, did you notice that the phrase "small world" is used more often than not, in situations where X knows Y and Z but didn't know that Y and Z know each other and when both Y and Z know each other but didn’t know that the other knows X. Um... yes. Think about it. We don’t usually use the phrase when we discover after the inquiry to discover if we have common friends.  Shyama's gone. It was a happy fare-thee-well and there were no tears because those who should have been shedding them, bravely suppressed them. I think I wouldn't be able to do that. Shyama's a special girl and I'm proud of her. Not jealous. That's something new for me too. I guess that's cause I love her. I'll be waiting for her when she comes back. I remember crying non-stop when Shane left for Australia. I couldn't stop for a week. It turned me into blubbering trash. Oh! ALSO! Anand told me that there might be hope for me to be able to apply again next year because they're making arrangements to meet the permanent secretary of defense to discuss something. I really hope things turn out well. I'm so thrilled!  "The average person thinks he's not". Perhaps it's true, but I was thinking about it on the bus the other day and I figured that that's something a jealous person would say in he attempt to bring other's mentalities down to fit his ideal equilibrium.  That sounded good. I'm back!  I woke up at 1.25pm and it's 4.15pm now. I have to get to work. Instead, I'm playing with my bass, my drums and listening to Sunday morning over and over again. Desiree is great. I miss her lots. I have 4 physical geog essays, 1 human geog essay, 2 war lit essays, 1 othello essay, 1 prac crit essay and 2 tamil essays. That makes eleven essays Tim! GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO! Will write again tonight.

      I learnt how to play mahjong today. Interspersed with drama bitching which I chose not to partake of. I'm dissed at Sharm. Can't care much about Jolyn anymore though.  Have got to get down to work. I have got a severe backlog of essays which I need to finish.  Met Shyama for a little get together before she leaves tomorrow. We didn't talk much, but that's ok. We're close enough to know that words are of not much significance. I want more wholesome people like Shyama, Khin and Leon. They are innocent. Nobody is absolutely innocent, but these people keep it clean. I want to be with them. It's a pity. I think there might be tears tomorrow at the airport.  I think I'm losing interest in writing coz I can't write any more. I feel like my writing's going in circles and that I've got no more energy to go on. There are some articles which I've been thinking about but they are too complex in thought and too tedious to put down on paper, or here for that matter.  Tell me reader. Am I losing my flare?

      I'm looking at my hand now. I can see the veins. They are green. Green through my skin. My skin is brown. When I raise my hand, the veins go back in, when I lower my hand, the veins slowly pop back out. I think it's because there's more pressure of blood in my hand when it's down. My blood is red. Is yours, and are you sure? Ca you be positive? Coz some people I know don't behave like their blood is red. I'd like to believe that people with red blood are human. Animals have red blood too. Maybe they're animals.  I feel talkative and inquisitive tonight. Now mix that with a sad playlist of old memories and you have me sitting here doing this. I remember that I wanted to be a scientist when I grew up. Mummy bought me a book with an acorn on the cover. I lost interest in it quickly because its contents did not interest me that much. Oh! I do remember crystal growing and things like that. Mummy and I, we did the coolest things.  I pulled out of school early today, I did feel down in the morning but that soon left me. I think I convinced myself that I was sick. I climbed out of the back gate and walked to Buona Vista MRT. I passed the primary school. Flashback after flashback. I began to talk to myself. HEY Casey! Help me fold my aeroplane. I brought nice white paper today. You could fold the one with the jaggered wings or the one with that special hole for stability. Wow Casey, Where'd you learn how to do that? When the end of recess bell rang, we'd all run to the porch. I remember I used to have trouble remembering the word porch. I called it the place with the holes in the walls. I used to chill out in the holes. Lean back on the curvature and shut my eyes and watch the light turn red through my eyelids. Oh Gosh! The more I think about it now, The more of the place I can see in my mind. We left the paper planes everywhere. The green grass was littered with white planes of all types. Some were in the eco-pond too. We used to have monkey bar fights. Opponents would start from either side and try to bring the other one down by preferably wrapping their legs around the opponents’ waist and jerking them downwards. Lynnette with the down syndrome was the queen and Able George was the undisputed boss. He got his pants yanked off one fateful day though. Fateful because he was conveniently not wearing underwear. We used to dab out hands in the bald batch of ground so that we'd get more grip. We were not like the adults with all their chalk and all. So messy, that white powder bowlers and boxers used. We used what was around us. Childish ingenuity. So who ever said being childish was all bad?  My first fight was there, at that volleyball court. Something about Aruna Mohan and Butts and a bitchy Chikgu. I was sent to the ominous Dorothy Ho and she taught me that it took two hands to clap with a practical demonstration. Dorothy Ho is not so scary anymore and the old infrastructure has been changed. The monkey bars are gone along with the paper aeroplane place.  God was good. How ever did he come up with the concept of memory? When you're alone, you're not really alone coz you have characters like Dorothy Ho and Casey to play with over and over again. Like a video archive. A very extensive video archive.  Cheers to all the small things.

      Fairfield. There is no word more appropriate than this now. Fairfield. Yesterday, I graduated. It was not a happy thing. It's leaving ten of the best years of my life behind. I remember the very first day I heard the word. Pati took me to register for primary one. We got off at the ACJC bus stop and walked all the way to the primary school. There's so many things I remember. Oh God, it's overwhelming.  I cried yesterday. When we did worship. When my choir sang. When we sang the school song and when we sang bless this school. God bless Farifield. I may be leaving it's gates just as I did after the O'levels, but Mrs Tang, and I'm sure her predicessors have said, "Once a Fairsian, Always a Fairsian". I will take solace in that. I was proud to be a Fairsian. Proud.  Today was it. The last time the 2003 batch would ever be together again. The founders day dinner. Everyone who came, came dressed up. It was good to see everyone happy. That's what gives me peace. We had some sort of a dinner today. I paid $60 but I couldn't have eaten more than $6 worth of food. The rest of the time was spent wandering about watching people smile and pose for photos. I took snapshots of them in my mind. It's a real pity that my family doesn't have a solid video camera or a good camera for that matter. I will just have to sourse for photographs then.  We "worked" with Leon on eating baby Octopuses.. octopusses.. octopi? He was, well... apprehensive.  Throughout the night, we watched pictures and memories projected on a wall. They did not evoke much, but we did take an N*Chink photograph. That was good! I miss my 2C. Someday I will tell you about 2C. We did many things and if only we could get together to reminisce. That would be wonderful. I will set it up.  The band consisted of Jireh, Pow Wee, Chris Ong, Eu Liang, Samuel, Leon and I. We practiced twice before this. We're all pretty good at what we do. God was with us. On monday, I'd fallen ill with the flu. Though the sniffles were clearing up, there was another problem. A singers worst nightmare. Soar throat during the period of the gig. I was careful. Drank a gallon of magic juice and took plenty of losenges. It still wasn't better. Today was quite the rush. Fun rush. Dad picked me up at home. We went to pick Cheam up. We couldn't find Cheam. We turned around to scour the roadsides. Cheam called us and we picked him and his sax up after that. We went to Eu Liang's school to pick him and his piano up. We were en route to Leon's when I remembered that I'd left the mikes behind. My father's language was interesting and my friends were amused. We decided to come back for the mikes later. On the way to Leon's we picked Pow Wee, his amplifier and guitar up. Then we paid the chouffer for the night's revels. Picked Leon up, went to Reiner's and broke in. Now I know how to break in to Reiner's place. Took the drumset and sent the boys in a cab to Pan Pac. Jireh and Chris were instructed to do the same. Leon, I and Daddy went back to get the mikes afterwhich we headed to Pan Pac. Oh boy... That was tiring.  The music, when performed thrilled the noisy croud. I asked Zhu to help back me for "This love's" chorus. Other than that, I held it alone with the boys. Heaven was good too but the best song, without a doubt, was Friends. I sang it. The whole cohort stood, arms around each other and swayed. Teachers cried and friends cried. I cried watching them. I think my voice wavered once or twice because of emotion. There was such meaning in the song that I was one with it and I spoke through me. It was the language of emotion. I don't think I've ever done anything quite like it. I've performed more times than i can count now, but this one was special. I was not exceptionally prepared. I had the lyrics on the floor. I can't explain it. It's like, you cry because it fills you and you feel the beauty and meaning of the music. I dare say, it was the most powerful performance I've ever given.  There is so much I cannot even begin to express it. No, I can express it.   Fairfield

      Today is the 3rd of August. 2 years ago on this day, I was the happiest I've ever been.  I feel so helpless that I can't help Zel. She's suffering and I'd take the pain if I could. Before we got together I used to tell her that "anything" was a word that I'd use only if I really meant it. I still so. I would do anything to make her feel better.  This entry was almost going to be a complain-about-stress session, but occasion demands otherwise. Well, the occasion doesn't. There's nothing special about today. I'm going to struggle to get up to go to school in the morning. Fail an econs test just after noon and direct an abstract drama piece in the early evening. At about 6 I'll be going over to Fairfield for the Founders day graduation day service. It hasn't really hit me until now, but I'm actually graduating from high school. It's a sad day that brings to a close the happiest days of my life.  I'm very confused about what I should write about tonight. It all seems so important. I really should sit down and write about all my memories in Fairfield some day. But know this reader, I do not wish today to be one of closure. I want it to last. I hope it lasts forever. I would go back and re-live secondary school. Everything. The picture would be incomplete if just a day was missing. The more I think about it the emptier I feel and the more I wanna sit around all day and cry. I think I'm going to cry now.  She doesn't remember what day it is. That's ok. I can understand. She's practical. No point clinging onto the past. I'm sentimental. She's hurt and she's put up a brick wall so that she doesn't get hurt again. It's my fault. Sure it was her fault that this happened too. I do not doubt that. But I'm afraid to tell her that because she'd flare and I'd have messed it all up again. It's true and I sound like a broken record. I tried to make myself feel better but I've just done the opposite.  It's a silly thing- this vow she's sticking to. And I don't even remember consenting to it but I don't think she'd lie to me. She said that she'd never get back with someone who's broken up with her. Today, rationale was provided. Because she doesn't want to be the toy. How do I get her to see?! I feel so helpless. It's like you know with all your heart that it could work, but she won't allow it.  Oh my God. Maybe she doesn't love me anymore.  Happy anniversary Zel. It's been 2 years, 730 days, and I love you like we've only just begun.

      Moliere went spectacularly for the first night and a third as well for the second night. Shame on you if you're reading this and didn't go if you were invited. Shame on me for not advertising it here. I have learnt that I have a problem on stage. It's not am external deficiency. I project well and have presence. What I do not do is trust the script. On the last night of production, I was told (indirectly) that I needed to be a responsible actor as well as trust the line enough to bring out it's truth. Whatever that means. It sounds like something a hippie would say when they tell you in a drunk cum enlightened cum speech impeded tone "make love not war", or "peace dude". It makes sense though coz it comes from Mrs. C. She's the boss. I will try to do better next time by maintaining the "stability" of the play and not letting it spin into a "vortex". I have to admit, it does sound like something that someone who doesn't know what he's talking about would say. But Mrs C knows a hell lot more than I do and there's no question of pride when it comes to her coz she's the boss.  Leon and I thought about why the second night's audience was so unresponsive. We figured it was the introduction, which was more of an offensive challenge rather than a modest invitation. We figured it was the temperature and stuffiness of the place. We figured that it was the beautiful five-for-fighting song that was cut abruptly before it ended. Well actually, I figured these out. Leon wouldn't say things like these. He's too politically correct. He's wise because he watches what he says.  We were at NYDC and I was penniless. Hence, I resorted to palm-fulls of cheese sprinkles meant for pizza. The man at the table next to ours gave me a strange look, which I managed to observe via the marvels of peripheral vision. I did not talk to Jolyn. It bugs me less now. Just like Dawn. Loss is existent, but soon, you stick up for yourself. And when you do, the other party becomes wronger and wronger. The self-righteous call this trait, "pride".  Mummy and I have been fighting about me coming back late. She treats me like a child. I want to be treated like a precocious child. Still doted upon, but given ample freedom. I mean, I did call her to tell her where I was. What's more, the girls with me didn't have to do that. She does not know how lucky she is to have me as a son. I know plenty of people who wouldn't bother or wouldn't be required to tell their parents where they are. I know that it's not fare that she says "it's your business to go and eat, not socialize" on the last night of production. My mother is a liar. She's been one since I was a kid. She used to twist my words to suit her whim and all I could do was suffer injustice in silence. Well well well, can't really play that game with me now can she? I'm supposed to honouring my parents. Hence, to balance my words, I shall now say that it's because of her that we eat. Of course this comes with the price of not being around. But that's ok. It's not important to her anyway. I'm not very polite to her. I feel bad about that. I should be so polite that she'd be doing herself harm by twisting her words with me. I can play a card game without even having to hold cards.  Am still sure that there's an exclusive clique in drama and that I'm not appreciative of it. I don't like this concept and I'm sure beyond the shadow of a doubt that collective unity is always more fulfilling. Too bad that almost everyone there is a politician. I'm very sick today. It's a level 8 Zel. And politicians only serve to make matters worse.  The national drama competition preliminary rounds were today. I hold what some would call the anchoring role. I cried when the scene called for it, which would have amounted to about 5, or 6 times. I will do my best for the team. I was not certain of the emcee was male or female.  Homework pile up. I think I'll skip school tomorrow. For some reason, my tagboard's down. I have no idea why but my friend says that the same thing's happening to her, so I'm less worried now. Khin left yesterday. I miss her already. No matter, online friendships work too! Poor Leon, I'll be there for you bro. That's what I do. Tata's been discharged but he's still very weak and the doctors didn't tell us anyting about significant recovery.  I wanna go stay with Pati and Tata again.  Zel and I just had a big fight. It's all spoilt again. I dont know what I did to do this. It's not her I know coz of what happened but I don't understand God, why you're punishing me like this? I'm so distraught I feel like hurting myself all over again. I can now expect empty cries from associates, so don't bother writing me any. Oh God, I wish she'd call. I know she's hurting and I want to help her desperately but I dont know how!  Oh God, she did call. And now I feel worse. Fortune, thou art inconstant.
