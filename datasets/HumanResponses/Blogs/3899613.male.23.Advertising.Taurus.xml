      To Mr. Johnson  	I am sorry to tell you that the Creative Circus is not all that I have found it all cracked up to be. It has the engrained aspects of a daycare. I have found that the teachers are just as incomprehensible as the students especially with the encompassing amount of negativity crude language usage. This place is more negative then a bully picking on a mentally challenged kid. I also do not understand the credibility of this school, though I have only been here for a short period of time.  	The work here is so illogical that it is really a waist of my time. I feel that it will never be used in the advertising world, just like how Calculus and Algebra are normally never used in the real world either. I think that the sooner we work on real actual projects then the creative advertising process will be controlled and conquered to the extent of learning real advertising production. Creativity is not exhaustive; it is an expression of an opinion. This place is overly critical who said that you couldn’t do this or that. Personification is bad, abstract is good, everything you know is nothing and this is how it is, this way or no way. Well is it that I know something you do not know. Maybe, but it depends on the client.  	I think that first quarter students should do creative thinking to the extent of opening the mind to out of the box ideas but you should see that their box is, people don’t think the same on everything.  For copywriters you should keep them in focus for copy in the advertising nature, not having to create storybooks that we have to design in the most peculiar way. It is very idiotic for a copywriter to do such extravagant things, but I do understand that we need to understand all aspects of advertising but come on this is very far fetched you think.  	I heard a rumor that there are going to be ceilings built, where are they, and what is up with all of the white walls, not very creative. I was also told that the classes were going to be small, there are about 15 in a class that is not very small for creative classes that need extreme hands on and personal involvement.  	Do you think that you can tune up the basketball hoop and maybe get a few balls so that we can have a game going?

      Ideas for blogger  If you had a million dollars what would you do and why?  Create an invention that would revolutionize the world or improve the standard of living. How would it work, what will it do, and what is its purpose?  If you were athletic what sport would you play, what team and position, and explain why you chose this sport?   If you were to create a sport what would be the name of it and how do you play it?  If you were a club owner what type of bar and or club would you theme it as and why?  Display a profile for yourself that would be used for an Internet dating service, under the topics: tell about yourself 100 words. What your partner would be like. And what a first date would be like.  If you were to build a paradise what would it look like, who would be there, and why would it be paradise?

      Quote that speaks to me.  Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) (attributed)   This school is insanity because we have to work on the same thing over and over again to tweak it until it molds into the concept. But working from the same point in one mind all together will only point you in one narrow direction. Influences from others provide feedback and insight to other creative ideas. How can you work on something fifty times and get different results without altering the method of your doing. There is no speculation on what it can be; it is what it is because of what it is. Rudi metric shapes and colors that have no real meaning but the one that you so call give to it, which is an opinion with little to no value unless you are preaching to the choir. Words that show intelligent on the matter but can be abstract or not even really pertaining to the object of focus at all just to theoretically explain what others have regurgitated to you then onto us. Making us all alike with the same now common knowledge that fills our heads with jargon. It is true ignorance is bliss but knowledge is power to the extent to invade the bliss of the ignorant and torment them with pointless knowledge of trivial increments of the past. Who cares what you have read or what movie you saw. Why would ones opinion influence the masses to act in different ways other then their norm.  Culture is a mind control that provides the actions and reasons why and how one acts. If you take a baby into another environment then the baby will grow up in the learned culture of that environment.  So to teach the same thing over and over and over again and again is pointless because the people of that culture will all be the same. You take a teacher from another culture and reinstitute their ways which are ironically different from our way and then you have real learning, a global learning, from all point of views so that this ingrained bullshit which most of it is lies does not corrupt the aspect of truth that people are paying great amounts of money to become educated.  If someone does not know then look it up, don’t go making up stories. Christopher Columbus was taught to be a great man that could do no wrong. Wrong, he murdered Indians and was a real bastard. Pardon my French.  In psychology there was a movement called Behaviorists, they only worked with what they could observe and give characteristics to labeled under what behavior was attributed to. There were also many other movements too, but now they have mostly merged because walls were torn down and ideas and theories were applicable to a variety of concentrations.  Is art really art, my teacher in college said no. But everything is art. How can you define art, everything follows a path and direction of given attributes that classifies it as art and so forth.  It is insane to define something that others have already defined or not. Who gave them that right to define something, unless they invented it? True creativity is invented by making something new. So when you work on something insane say to yourself ask for help.

      John: 	I left my house on my bicycle on this beautiful Monday morning on my way to school. As I approached the corner of my neighborhood I met my friend Frank. He was on his skateboard. We were on our way to school and we were in the same class.  	Right before we turned the corner of the fenced in yard around the school Mickey, the school bully crossed our path and ordered us to give him our lunch money. Frank and I refused to and started to run across the street. Mickey caught me by the shirt in the middle of the street. There was a car speeding towards us. My shirt ripped and I rand and jumped in the grassy yard to the right of me. There was a bang with the sound of breaking tires, and as I looked up back at the street, there on the pavement laid Mickey winging in pain like a sobering baby without his bottle. Before I could get onto my feet people were already rushing to the scene.   Frank: 	It was seven-thirty A.M. and I was running late for school. I grabbed my skateboard and my mom kissed me goodbye for the day. I jumped the front steps and landed on my board heading to the corner of the neighborhood to meet John. When I met him I was out of breath and he had decided to ride his bike instead of his skateboard. He then got off his bike and we started to walk to school. 	We were laughing together and then I said, “great here comes Mickey, lets run for it.” I took off only to see john confronted by Mickey. He started to run across the street but got tangled by Mickey half way. I yelled, “Watch out!”  Before I finished yelling “out,” the car had struck Mickey. I had lost sight of John. I started to yell for him and with all of this commotion a crowd had already started to form.  Mickey: 	I was sitting on the bench along side the fence that surrounded the playing field. Doing my rounds with the kids as they walked to school. I had already accumulated twenty dollars and I needed thirty to go to the store later and still have enough for lunch.  	Here came Frank and John, my best customers as I called them because I did my business with them. As they spotted me Frank started to take off on his skateboard. I was able to stop John before he was able to get on to his bike. I told him to give me his lunch money. He said no and dropped his bike to run across the street. I was able to catch him in the middle of the street by his shirt. He was squirming trying to break free. I heard a Watch Out! I let go and before I knew it, it was all black and when I opened my eyes I was in immense pain, John was not in sight. I was all banged up and twitchy. I could not move being in too much pain. There was red liquid all around me and I started to feel faint as I blacked out.

       Today I was looking for a place to get a hair cut. In fact I went acrossLindbergh to Chester Bridge. I then took that south to Piedmont where I stoppedat a store to ask where a place to get a hair cut is. They had no clue becausethey were from India. So I traveled to Monroe street then at a gas stationwhere some Arabs told me that there was a barbershop down the street on Poncede Leon where I found a barbershop called Piedmont barbershop.  I walkedin and everyone just looked at me. After a frozen minute I sat down in achair and waited my turn. While I was waiting I was talking to one of themen sitting on the chair who worked there, but he could not cut my hair becauseI was already picked by al who still was finishing up his last customer.So I waited for about five minutes chatting with Abrum was his name, I toldhim that I went all over town looking for a place to get a hair cut. He askedme where I was coming from? I told him from around Lindbergh and that thiswas the first place I found. We also talked about football, the Atlanta Falconsand about Vick and then about the Lakers how we both wanted LA to lose, andwhat I was doing in Atlanta. Then I was finally called up. Al asked me whatI wanted. I told him that I wanted to look nice because my parents were visitingme this weekend. I told him that I usually get a number four on top and athree on the sides and blended. So for almost an hour he was cutting andtrimming my hair. He told me how  he has been there for about twenty years,and asked where I was from, and what I was studying. Abrum was still talkingto me too, he was keep on thinking that the Jaguars were going to play theFalcons this year, I was hoping that that was true, then he grabbed a schedulecard and we were wrong, so I said hopefully next year. While I was inthe chair I asked Al if he ever say the movie Coming to America with EddyMurphy he said that he recalls that one, I was told him that it was one ofmy favorite movies. He chuckled, and said yah that was a good one. Then hesaid I renounce my throne, I am no longer the Prince of Zamunda. Then I saidthe line, where should we go in America, it is such a big place, ah Qweens,that sounds like a good place. All in all I had a good time there. And theAl and Abrum were nice and friendly.  This hair cut was so long by thetime I left it was 3:30 and I walked in at 2. When he was getting finishedtrimming and buzzing be up he asked me if I wanted a shave? I told him nothank you. I then asked him how much it was and he told me ten dollars. ButI only had a five on me, I asked him if they took credit cards and he saidno, just cash. So I asked him where the closest ATM was. He told me thatthere was one down the street. Thank god it was a south trust bank. He toldme that they usually do not do this, because kids walk out without payingand do not return. But they told me that I have an honest face, and wouldgive me the benefit of the doubt. So I walked down to the corner about ablock away and got money out of the ATM. I returned and paid Al who gavethe money to Abrum who made change for me. Then Al gave me his card and saidsee you in a few weeks. As I was walking back to my car I was thinking ifI saw a super cuts on Peachtree a few nights ago. Any how I went in the oppositedirection and this is where I wound up.

      I am Jake’s pill bottle. I am a container that holds Ritalin. If Jake does not take my content orally, he will not be able to concentrate during the day. I am an awesome container that has the ability to hold up to one hundred pills and am sometimes used to hold other types of things because of my ability to preserve drugs. I am a yellowish orange container that keeps out UV light and I have a white cap that is childproof because you have to push down on the cap and then twist off.  I love my label because it just does not say what my content is but also it is my clothing. I would be no better then a bottle of Tylenol and that is not saying much. I am not an over the counter bottle, I am a pharmaceutical bottle and because of that it make me even more special. Being a pill bottle I normally spend most of my time in the dark sitting on the second shelf in a nasty smelling bathroom above the sink in the medicine cabinet. I find that to be ironic because of my UV protective plastic container. But on the Brightside I do get to see a florescent light bulb for approximately three minutes each morning and if I am unlucky some mornings and Jake leaves me on his filthy sink counter. Though it is lighter on the counter the toothbrush and toothpaste never really have much to talk about because they are real tools. I really like the Q-tip brand cotton swabs because they have so much more to say and are softer and nicer then the bristly full of bacteria toothbrush. I find the toothpaste to be too messy and always has too harsh of a mint flavor that just lingers like a bad vibe. I really hate when the toothpaste is squeezed out and is left in spotted clumped droppings around the sink basin because some time I get stuck in it and it is really sticky and ruins my clean label in which I pride myself and find my identity with the written content printed on it. When I am in the cupboard I am quite lonely because I am the only pill bottle here and I am not too fond of the box of Tylenol Sinus because they are always so whiney and have a nasally voice that causes the pills inside me to shriek. Though the cotton swabs are great, they tend to be so cliquish in their box where they lay intricately on top of each other in a bundle of one hundred. I know what you are thinking, just because I am able to hold a hundred pills and I should be happy about that but these Ritalin pills are just so dang chalky and leave a film that leaves me so wired then tired and groggy because unlike my owner Jake because I am a plastic bottle and do not have ADD or ADHD. If you are not familiar with Ritalin, it is also known as speed if you do not have ADD or ADHD. Sometimes Jake forgets to flush the toilet and it just reeks in the bathroom. Luckily I am a friend with the matchbook, who we are so lucky to have because if it were not for matchbook then we would get suffocated and swamped with that horrendous odor. But my Ritalin pills would not know about that since they are safely secured in my airtight vessel. My vessel is like its own self-inclusive environment immune to the outside the bottle world until found being digested, dissolving into Jakes body. I tell you, I cannot wait till Jake gets another girlfriend, because I used to be able to travel inside the purse of his girlfriend where there were all of these other containers of makeup but also some rather psychiatric pill bottles that were fun to talk to. It was also fun to play games on her cell phone too. Then there was this one time when she had a ring tune to Genie in a bottle, I love that song because I need one in my bottle to make a wish that I could join the spices in the kitchen and move out of this nasty bathroom.

      I am the type of person that likes to get things done early so that I can be lazy and or party when I want to. I have never really kept a journal before, probably because I never felt a need to or have just been too lazy to keep one up. If I did then it would just collect dust or even be covered with doodles because I never really examine my day to the extent to write a journal. I really do not even know many guys that keep a journal either. The only time that I really hear about a journal is when I watch a movie or something of that sort. A girl would normally have a journal and the mother, boyfriend, or little brother would always end up reading it. Then somehow it always starts up drama and anger from like evasion of privacy and so forth. I do not really need that form of torment. I do not even have any real secrets that I even would have the need to write down.  I guess that there are always positives to every situation. To keep a journal would probably help me know what I did on different days because they all just run into each other. I have somewhat of a hard time dating things too, but I figure that a calendar might be helpful on letting me know if it is Friday or Saturday.  I am not much of a complainer and I hardly ever ask for anything though I am always a mountain of questions looking for clarity. I am experiencing that the creative circus is not very clear on directions to help us find out for our self what it should be then get critiqued on the following works. I am a person that likes to get things done the first time or work with people to explore ideas, though I come up with awesome ideas on my own I really do not like having to revise a hundred times on whims of other people then of course end up back at what I started with and having them finally say ok. I would rather make three have them pick what they want and then add to it so that I really do not have to make a hundred variances of the same thing. But sometimes that is how the cookie crumbles and you have to provide that form of service.  I am an idea man, a creator of ideas for displaying and marketing advertising. I like to brain storm and create foundations for ideas.   Thank the lord for spell check because I am not the best at grammar, punctuation, spelling and diction. Normally I think of words that sound like the word that I am thinking of but end up saying a similar sounding word that means something totally different. I am trying to improve my vocabulary but on the moments notice like when people ask me questions or I am trying to think of the right word to say I can sometimes get boggled.  Overall I was never a really big person on journal writing. The plus side is that I am moldable and adaptable to new surroundings and lifestyles so if I have to do something that is helpful to me doing what I need to do, then just give me a little push in the right direction. But if I know that something is assigned to me I normally am clever enough to find a way to get it done.

      As I read some Blogs, I can see a trend of how people write these things, and their method of writing these online journals. They write them like full-blown essays. In complete thoughts that are methodological to essay writing stating what you are going to say, then supporting what you said, then reiterating what you have just said. These Blogs that I read have been very different from the ones that I have written and are also not as pessimistic as mine can be.  I find my writing to have a unique approach that is more emotional and wide spread like a rough draft would be for most. Some times I feel like ranting others I just go off into a tangent, and some might only make sense to myself. But the ones that I read from other classmates all have the same approach and I do not feel like they are crazy as mine are but more well developed and also more direct.  For me as a copy writer I am and never was great at spelling, diction, punctuation, and grammar, and to tell the truth it took me seven times to pass that test. The test was a computerized multiple-choice test, which had subtle errors, which means you really have to know the rules and styles from the AP handbook. This test was a 50 questions test and you were only aloud to miss five questions to have the minimum passing grade for the test. I took this test for like two hours the seventh time I took it to make sure I had the answers right because I would have failed the class, though this test was an outside the class / mandatory test. But in other words I am still trying to work on these things. Especially since I started my major in journalism and then changed my major to Advertising.  	Back to the review, I chose J Mueller: Why Zippo Sucks. I found it very informative about how he felt about advertising for this product; he kept the same tone throughout his writing and gave some morsels of his personality in his writing. There seemed to be not much feeling (emotional) as to more explanatory compositions in his Blog.  It was like reading an essay to say the least, not that it’s a bad thing and I am only a first quarter to say the least, but show some heart let us know how you really feel about Zippo besides scratching the surface. You also prove your point through explanation of past experiences and methods of your creative process. This is all in an essay format still. As I said there is nothing wrong with essays but essays are very much in the realm of the education style box mentality. Which is a nice style of writing but has its creative limits. But overall it was a good essay.

      	The sport of sitting motionless. Not being able to move or even flinch while other people try to make you move, though they cannot inflict actual pain including pushing and obscure touching, or use phobic instruments to antagonize you. But everything else is game. Be creative to make the participant move. I think this would be the hardest game because you are racing time and competing against others to see who can last the longest. I am sure that this game can really be intense and helpful to knowing your limits.  There really are no costs prohibiting anyone to play, but someone who would actually play this game would have a lot of balls to let others haze and torment you for a sport.  This sport does not seem boring or to suck per say, except if you are the on trying to stay still. How difficult would that be?  	Back in high school I took drama as an elective, and we ad to act out being a mime and so forth. Anyways I chose to be like a manikin as an act in class. Fellow students then positioned my body as I stood there like a manikin. Then they started to draw on me and put lipstick on me and other stuff that was not consisted of food or drink, I did not move the whole time unless they repositioned me, such as my arms or even made me sit in a chair.  	As I sat in the chair I hardly even blinked or move my stomach as I breathed. Then one of the girls in the class decided to sit on my lap and try to make me move, I just sat there, her hair was in my face and so forth. I just sat there with nothing going through my head, just blankness. It was like an out of body experience. I just focused on a point on the wall and every little surrounding impulse and distraction disappeared and there was nothingness, surrounding me like I was in a trance.  	I know what it is like to play this game to an extent, and from this experience is what I base the game upon. So now I ask you now, do you have the guts to play this sport? To place your body in the hands of another with little control of what happens unless you finally quite and let them win or the person you are competing against win. How far will you go?

      If I had a super power I would not pick just one because there are so many powers which I would take full use.  	The first power that I would love to empower is invisibility; I would use this super power to move around and spy on people. A lot of people say that others talk smack about me behind my back. I would really like to know what they are saying about me. That is why I would like to be invisible. Besides walking unnoticed I would also follow behind people to enter movies for free, and maybe even play some practical jokes on some bullies. Invisibility is cool but it also has its limitations like anything else.  	I am really interested in what people say about me, and want to know why they have to be so cowardly to say things behind my back. I would prefer if people would confront me and let me know these things that are bothering them. I am known to some times have grudges but I get over them. I would be less inclined to hold a grudge if I were to be confronted and given the knowledge to improve myself. That is probably why I have a timid sense of shyness around people. If I were invisible I would be able to learn so much about others and see who exactly are my friends and who pretend to be. That is the one thing that I do not like about the south. There is always a sense of falseness with people. They like to be nice in person then they backstab you once you walk away. That is the only thing that I really have against the south. If I were to be able to be invisible then I could see how miserable or even how bipolar people really are in the terms of socializing and how they manage personal and external situations in a natural setting.  	Another super power I would love to have is the ability to fly. I am sure that at one point in everyone’s life the yearning to fly. Not worrying about having to drive anywhere, or waiting in line, or even when flying sitting in a tight chair surrounded by other strange or annoying people.  	The freedom of flying where you want to go checking out the sites or just joy flying around. It sounds so great and empowering. The freedom to be unbounded by land has always been an awesome idea to me, I would love to defy gravity and fly like a bird, migrating to where ever I would like to go, see and experience. No more cars, no more pollution from exhaust, and no more anger from waiting in line for mass transit, and road rage. Being able to fly would be awesome, because not having to deal with any one. And the high ground is always the best ground, when you get in a fight you can drop things on people and better maneuver around because no one else can move upwards. To me flying would be blissful because then I really can have my head in the clouds.

      I think that Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger would make a great president because he is a real realist. He seems to be able to set things in motion and set them right. Look what he is doing for California. He has been straightening out the budget problems that others have caused in the past. He has been creating more jobs for the state. And he has overall been a good influence. He even has a good sense of humor too. He can take a joke. I think that he is really underestimated. I do not see him trying fighting and bickering like a sniveling baby trying to hide lies and the past. Yes people make fun of him because of his image but they do not ridicule him for his actions or create hate on his behalf. I think that he is very genuine and is a great goal setter. I am not saying that he is flawless but I look at his record. He knows how to listen and get things done.  	He almost reminds me of Ronald Reagan not just that they were both movie stars but, the fact that they are people of action and stand behind what they do.  	In this election I do not think that either of the candidates really have a mentality of their own, they are like puppets being paraded by their parties, made to bicker at each other and take bribes from companies like many politicians do today. Both candidates I think do not know how to think for themselves, come to think of it, when was the last time if not ever a politician actually wrote his own speech. Sure actors can play president in movies or TV but they are only acting, that is the difference, and they can state the obvious to and try to be informative or even comedic. But do you think that the politicians actually watch and soak these things in., I do not think so they would rather beat around the bush and use jargon on why they can’t do this or that or wouldn’t you rather have this then that game which or who would pay for it. I tell you that if they stopped those childish games and were not so greedy then it would get accomplished.  	As I said these people are talkers not doers, and they lie about it very well. So I think Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger is a doer because he knows what hard work and determination are. He was a professional athlete in the sport of bodybuilding, which takes great determination and a constant degree of hard work. He is also an actor, which I cannot truly hold against him, though some who are in that occupation are ignorant and decide to speak out their opinion hoping that their word can become a fact. Like Sean Penn or even some other well known in Hollywood. But acting too takes dedication and hard work too, like any other profession. But with politics the basis of hard work changes for most. And for some that truly want to do the right thing and not be persuaded by greed and harmful influences can do a wonderful job. I just do not see that in Bush or Kerry. In fact all I have seen them do is try to conform to the masses in a race for popularity. I do not even hear about their platforms and how they plan to set things in motion, they are too caught up in their own quarrel trying to out do each other. Honesty I know some one else can do a better job and be honestly more dedicated then the both of them put together. I even think that Ross Perot can do a better job though he might be too old to still run, that man was a real businessman too and he knew the value of a hard earned dollar and for the need of American jobs in this country. What the hell is Kerry thinking that by outsourcing jobs to other countries because it is cheaper to buy products from them that it would help our economy and reduces the deficit. Then go right against his word the next day and tell people that he plans to create more American jobs. Personally I think he his an idiot, because how could printing more money and then sending it off seas do anything more then deepen the well of the budget deficit. Personally the only way to stop it is to stop printing money that America cannot back. Also by creating more jobs in America is a great thing because then you narrow the spending to fund the homeless because you are able to give them jobs. Of course you have to spend some money on them to help get them back on there feet. The mentality of Americans is that they want everything handed to them, that needs to change, look how productive china is, they know the value of hard work and little pay. What I think America should do not quite what China does but learn from others to the point of molding today’s youth into good workers. Because if you do not put the effort in then the quality will never be good as the quantity. I think that American made should mean a good quality product made by the workingman who is an American. You cannot solve a problem if you have it solved by another. Like the saying goes, if you want it done right you need to do it yourself but it also does not hurt to ask for help.  	As a president he/she should be honest and open to opinions, but also smart about the decisions, evidently Bush is not a good chess player because be does not think things thoroughly through. He is more of a person who tries to do thinks swift and at the moment and is not very intelligent on the matters at hand and is ignorant on advice. Look at how the 9/11 reports were going, and look at all the propaganda with the Middle East. I tell you if it was not for the backing of the large oil companies we really would not of gone there, and if we had a better candidate then Bush then we would be like Ireland and starting to manufacture and use other sources of fuel then Oil. 	I think that if enough people made that concern then newly politicians like Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger would be smart enough to make that move and help to change that resource.  The only thing that makes Schwarzenegger not a valid candidate is that he is not American born. And honestly to say I think that that rule should stay because only an American should be commander and chief.

      this is a women;s fashion store that targets women aged 25 through 60. i am saying sixty because everyone that I saw enter the store on Monday was around the age of 50 to 60.  i really did not see any one buy any clothing from there, but the maximun number of costomers during the hours of 2:30 and 4pm were abot three. it was a very slow day at the store. I was sitting at a bench infront of the store wich was right outside of Parsian. You could hear the rock music invadinding the walkway of the mall outside the store. But when you walked into Chico:s you heared easy listening what was too soft to leave the confinds of the store.  As I was sitting there was a weird array of oders meshing pungently together creating an almost foul and thick tasting oder. the smells that were roaming tthe enviroment were, grease from the food court and the smell of cookies being baked, mixing with the smell of the makeup and purfume from the makup department in the intreance of Parisian. It was like i was in someones grandparents smelly house, who was having a dinner party of some sort. because old people during fancy gatherings where too much makeup and purfume, and like to bake cookies. It was an awkward smell that keeps you awake but makes you confused if you want to stay or leave.  The store was empty, people walking by its modern looking store front.  Which had a few manikens behind the floor to almost ceiling windows. the boarder of the windows was a pasty/creamy white rectangle that went into the center of the enfrance.  The entrance was wooded block panneled cubes stacked lin three forming a column, one on each side of the glass doorswhich were propped open by a red "sale" sign. On top of the doors was like a mantle wich was like the boarder on top of the windows. Then above that was the store name resessed from the wood pannel in a brushed steel, blocked letter. Behind the name was it was lit up with a pinkish blue glowing light highlighting the name.  I sat and observed the store front as old ladies walked past hardly glimpsing at the store. some walked in but minutes later were walking back in. one girl was making an inquary to go in as they passed and the mother shook her head noding keep walking. in the store the clothing was mostly maroon and dark reds, and black, and some had some designs printed or nitted texture in the cotton and rayon looking fabric, the style of the clothing were like work casual to going out nice fashionable wear. but nothing really special.  the smell in the store was like a steril cleen smell which had i faint scent of carpet cleaner smell which was almost unnoticeable compared to the old women and there hevily  scented fragrances that they were probably trying on at Parisian before they entered the store. i got board sitting there so i went over to brookstone and got a massage in one of those chairs before I went and saw a movie.

      I met this girl on the internet, we were talking for about an hour on the computer. We exchanged pictures and phone numbers but I had to call her because she does not have long distance on her phone and my cell phone is out of Florida. So I talked to her for a while and found out this and that from her, she works at target and is uncharged of cargo importing for the store and manages the trucks deliveries from 1am to 3am.  so I met her for a movie that was not very good. And she was a short round girl. Unlike the picture that she sent me. She then insisted that I should look at the pictures of her kids, though she said that she had none on the web, it was a nightmare. so in the movie we were sharing the pop corn and she devoured it like she haven't eaten in a week. I tried to be cool about it, and now I know why they give free refilled on large. But we bought separate drinks, I did not even want to think about sharing a drink with her. her popcorn buttered hand would occasionally slip on mine even when I wasn't reaching for the popcorn. She was trying too hard to flirt with me, she even put her head on my shoulder as if we were cuddling during the movie. I hated the movie too the note book sucked. I do not know why I put myself in these situations. Have you ever seen a girl waddle she had a little waddle, in her but when she walked. It was the cutest thing that I physically found about her. She did have a sweet voice though too, it was a shame to put the face to the voice. She was the one that was not afraid, I was somewhat afraid because she was throwing out a lot of signs and I really did not want to hurt her feelings so I just gave the old smile and nod, I really did not say much, though we were at the movies anyways, before and after I was a loss for words. after the movie, we said goodbye and went our separate ways. I haven't talked to her since. I now know better than to meet people off of the internet. it was nothing like the show blind date. It would be cool to go on one of those though because the normally have good looking girls on the show. I guess this wasn't a true blind date but internet dating is normally an upset. So don't do it, unless it is one of those censored sights, even those though can be sketchy too. My brother tried one and also had a very bad date too. And you have to pay just to communicate with them, it is like an online pimp.
