      Do you rely on a "good gut reaction" or that "special feeling" when interviewing perspective employees? Are you confident that your new hires will be successful? Are you good at interviewing prospective employees?  When I talk with executives and ask if they are good at selecting successful employees, they often indicate they have (or have not) been lucky lately. It’s not a matter of luck any more than picking a $50,000 piece of capital equipment is a matter of luck.  Recruiting is should be based on planning, excellent interviewing skills, and due diligence.  The Interview Today we are dealing with sophisticated applicants, many of whom are better interviewees than you may be an interviewer. They may have their resume professionally prepared or use sophisticated word processors with spell checkers and grammar checkers. Additionally, there are books, computer programs, tapes and classes to prepare a resume’ and to develop the ability to mask unpleasant information.  How many times do you finish an interview feeling that you just sat through a rehearsed script. If this is happening, you are probably not digging deep enough to get through the practiced veneer of the interviewee. An interview should be more than a conversation but less than an inquisition. An interview is a listening process to ferret out specific information to make a decision to hire or not hire.  If you are doing more than 40% of the talking you are not spending enough time listening. Furthermore, you should not be silently formulating the next question while the interviewee answers your previous question. When this happens, you’ve stopped listening.  In a naturally flowing interview, the candidate often telegraphs a weakness or an area to question. Follow your natural instincts when interacting with candidates. If something does not make sense, ask the candidate to clarify their statement and be sure to ask follow-up questions.  Another area be aware of is when a candidate says starts down a logic path and then reverses themselves or corrects a misstatement. When this happens; he or she is often making an effort to restate the practiced response. Go back to the original idea to determine which is the accurate answer.  If the candidate uses terms such as, "we," or "they" or refers to a group or team, find out who was in the group, and what specifically was their role.  Be aware of body language. If their hands are clutched and they have white knuckles, if they suddenly lean back after you ask a question, if they are evasive, this may be a "trouble" spot, so pursue the issue. There is probably is information in that area that you will want to know.  Questions As interviewers, we all have been advised to ask open ended questions such as "tell me how you would manage the sales process." Open-ended questions, which deal in hypothetical situations, are theory questions. It may be more beneficial to ask open-ended behavioral questions, especially if the individual is an experienced interviewee. For example, How did you ..., What happened when..., How did you get ...., When were (weren’t) you ...., With a practiced interviewee, it is important to move from the theoretical to the behavioral line of questions.  An experienced interviewer listens to the candidate’s answers and asked the follow-on questions, who, what, where, when, why. tell me more about ... , etc.  Checking References -- Due Diligence If you have come this far, conduct a thorough reference check. When checking references do not go to personnel or payroll. Try to talk to the individual’s supervisor. Ask for information about performance, interpersonal relations, ability, motivation, attendance as well as dates, titles and compensation. Listen carefully and if necessary push a little in order to get complete information. Often, you will learn something that will either solidify your decision or knock the candidate out of contention. Sometimes you will only be told the basics but even that information has value. Remember that when selecting an employee your organization’ reputation, sales goals, products, and financial well being are at stake. Proceed with caution. A human asset doesn’t come with a guarantee and may turn around and sue you.  Planning means that a position’s requirements and responsibilities should be well thought out, not a string of broad generalizations. Recently, while discussing a search assignment in financial services, I was told the requirements for the sales position was "a person with a friendly personality, good quantitative skills and a solid work ethic." I suggested that they needed to be more specific. Otherwise, with those requirements, half the applicants we see would probably qualify.  Before beginning the interview process, set up a grid of "Musts" and "Wants" like the one below. Write down the requirements, skills, responsibilities and standards for success. It you cannot complete this step you should not begin interviewing. Go back and rethink the position and its composition. Clear-up requirements, reporting relationships, responsibilities and standards for success. Uncertainty on critical points may cause you to lose good candidates and probably result in hiring the wrong candidate.  FACTORS MUSTS(Go -- No Go Decision) WANTS(Nice to Have) Knowledge     Experience     Personal Traits     Standards of Success     Hopefully the interviews will identify a candidate that can, and will do the job. If the process is positive end the interview with some sales presentation about the pluses of working for the company. Provide positive feedback to keep the candidate interested until a decision or offer can be made and references checked.

      Some employers seem to go out of their way to lose the best employees they have. It is always the best employees who leave first as they have the most options. The employer is left with the least talented, least creative employees, the folks reluctant to take risks.  So how do employers accomplish this sort of an exodus?  * Hire your friends and family. This makes it clear to all employees that there is not an even playing field. Get close to the boss...and advancement is yours. It creates a climate of favoritism and brown nosing, which results in management being told what they want to hear. HINT: Any family or friends that are employed should not have a direct reporting relationship. They should compete like anyone else for the job and advancement.  * Don't allow any flexibility. In employee surveys, flexibility in schedules and time off are identified as more important than wages. Caught between raising children and caring for elderly parents, today's employees are sandwiched between conflicting demands. HINT: Make flexibility a priority. Focus on supporting the employee rather than policing the policies.  * Don't replace employees that leave...simply spread the work among remaining staff. Think of the immediate cost savings while staff becomes demoralized. People want to feel successful at work, not set up for failure. HINT: It takes years to undo a negative perception as an employer. Do not sacrifice employee retention for short-term gain.  * Compare staff members. Whether publicly or privately, comparison means someone always comes up short. Comparisons tend to demoralize and discourage and promote competition rather than cooperation. Cooperation is essential to build teams and create a learning organization. HINT: Never compliment one person at the expense of another. Don't engage in workplace gossip.  * Use praise instead of encouragement. What's the difference? PLENTY. Praise is given for a job completed. A job well done. Encouragement is given for effort or improvement. The problem with praise is it is often given only to those who need it the least. While there can be rewards for stellar performance, in a learning organization, more attention should be given to efforts across the organization. HINT: Establish systems that reward efforts and new ideas with a focus on improvement.  * Micro-manage all staff activities. Few things disempower staff like a boss who hovers over their shoulders questioning every move and managing each decision. The message is clear-"I have no confidence in your abilities." Staff feels discouraged and loses creativity. It is important to remember that there is more than one right way to do things. HINT: Hire good people, and then get out of their way.  * Leave job descriptions vague and uncertain. Similar to embarking on a major journey without a map, expecting great performance by "winging it" doesn't work. People tend to live up to the expectations given to them. HINT: Make job descriptions detailed and specific. Meet regularly with staff to discuss progress and encourage improvement.  * Give feedback only when there is a problem. The employee learns quickly that there is little recognition of what they do "right." The boss will be viewed as nitpicking and critical when they hear only the negatives. HINT: Meet with employees regularly to give positive feedback and encourage improvement.To keep the best employees in today's job market, the employee must be treated as a key customer. Make employee retention and development a top priority.

      Relations......  These days, we are speaking aboutInternational Relations, Customer Relations, ClientRelations, Employee Relations and in fact, Across theBorder Relations. All, the above relations aremonetary in nature and none of them is without anypurpose.  The philosophy is very simple, Give and Take.In the process, we are forgetting/ignoring ourpersonal relations, family relations and General HumanRelations, relations, which are based on values, love,affection and care.  You may call it as an influence of western culture orlack of time or self-fish nature of a person...we approach or remember our friends, relatives andsometimes even our parents...only at the time of need.There is no trust, no faith, no believe, no loyaltyand no love in relations.   Generally, whenever I extendmy hand for friendship, I face two types of queries from other people.  1)I don't know anything about you I am not interested? True, I don't know anything about you but does that stop you or me to know about each other. Relations,need time...in fact quality time.  2)What do you want from me? This is because, we knowthat nothing comes free and if some one is approaching you, it is only for some purpose. We believe that noone will be approaching you, without anypurpose...there is no self less relation. Probably yes, but I can assure you that I don't need you oryour help, I like to know about you, your values, yourbelieves, to understand you as a person...andprobably, I may be able to help you...sometimes...downin my life time.  I believe in two things:  1)Learning from other's experience  2)Every Person is Different  A child is born with numerous relations'...relations of parents, grandparents, relatives and what not. Why we are so poor in maintaining our relations? We are selfish, we are opportunistic, we never feel happy inthe happiness of others, we never celebrate otherssuccess and most importantly, we have doublestandards.  It is pathetic to know and read news like," Son murdering his mother or a father raping his daughter", these are the foundation of any relation...and if that foundation itself is so weak,what can we expect from other relations. Where are those values and culture, we are so proud off?  The question is very simple, if you are not able to maintain your relations with your parents, your children, your relatives and yourfriends, which are lesser in number and known to you;how are you going to maintain your relations with employees, which are larger in number and not known to you?

      1. Protect Your Investment : The HR team must come down hard on managers who consistently drive away good talent or who inadequately prepare new recruits for the job ahead.  2. Re-recruit Your Best People Call frequent reviews and conferences with employees to determine when, where, and how HR can induce star talent to stay on board.  3. Heed the Big Three: Contribution, Growth, and Fun Measure your talent according to these three keywords. People are most likely to quit jobs that fail to offer stimulating projects that encourage personal development.  4. Web-ify Your Recruiting Process: Leverage the power of the Web by building and fostering a digital gateway where candidates can learn about the company, chat online with employees, and email the appropriate representatives with questions, comments, and resumes.  5. Sell Your Culture: Talk to the candidates, bring in employees who have left the company and come back, hire a marketing firm to specifically sell the company brand and personality to prospective candidates.  6. Think Outside the normal modes of recruitment : Rather than simply post a job online, think creatively about referral incentives for employees and other alternative models for finding and attracting the top talent.  7. Detox bad policies -- such as inflexible work schedules and stringent dress codes -- before they poison the corporate culture and turn away potential candidates.  8. KISS principle : "Spell It Out"! Communicate the rules clearly and openly, but don't hesitate to rewrite them as needed. Small, thoughtful changes can have an enormous impact on morale and retention.  9. Demand Pre-Exit Interviews Speak with employees before they submit two weeks' notice. These interviews, based on trust and integrity, may help an unhappy employee and affect overall recruiting and retaining strategies.  10. Blame Yourself:  "Start with the premise that you are a crappy manager, and that's why your people are leaving!" "Treat your employees as resources for improving your performance and the performance of the company."

      Yesterday I was quite clear about my life and where I was heading, had put the lid on my previous relationship and was set to move forward.   But hten, there was the major change which happend this morning...I had a chat with him..it was hearbreaking, I thought I would get some closure on stuff..but instead it opened up my wounds and fears.  I dont know if its a case that he is playing on my fears or I played on my fears which is why I have got here or what!  He was short of begging and pleading with me, what did I do to get this! My life is torn up so badly where I have my parents on one side and him on the other.  My parents have done everything for me, cant I sacrfice this atleast for them?  God bought me onto this planet to be their guide in their old age and be their treasure.    Yes, I am in pain, I am confused, can this ever be fixed, or do I stand to lose my best friend in life..the same person with whom I had planned everything from the look of our bedroom to our kids names!  This aint going to help me or anyone else...I have to take a decision..and I dont think I have the choice here, I have select my parents, coz they have given me a lot more than I can ever think about!

      This saturday was quite a different one compared to my old saturdays, no slogging it out at work, sat at home and relaxed out. &nbsp; Started the day out with one heavy duty circuit workout at the gym and followed it with a nice hot water bath..man, the hot man believe me helps to soothe those muscles up!&nbsp; Then I decided, its time to start to pick up some of the old pieces of my life...yes, my painting.&nbsp; Had about 2 paintings overdue and 3 orders, so it was high time I put my ass on the line and completed it.&nbsp; So after slogging it out for 4 hours thro the afternoon, I finally took a break and decided to listen to some of my old cds.&nbsp; Hardly had an idea as to what I was playing, put pushed in the cd, closed the room door, lay on the ground and allowed the music to take over my senses. &nbsp; Gosh, I seriously dont know how I picked this particular CD....the songs were a little on the older side, most of my favorites which I had compiled over a little more than a year ago.&nbsp; The songs sure did haunt me.....too apt for my current state of&nbsp; mind... &nbsp; Toni Braxton - Unbreak my heart, Spanish Guitar &amp; Breathe Again Eric Chalpton - Tears in Heaven Wet Wet Wet - Love is all around Daniel Bedingfield - If you are not the one Wham - Last Christmas Madonna - Say good bye Celine Dion - Power of Love Seal - Kiss from a rose Phil Collins - Another day in paradise Take that - Nobody else OST Alladin&nbsp;&nbsp;- Its a whole new world OST Lion King- Circle of Life OST Dirty Dancing - I've Had the time of my life Bed &amp; Breakfast - If you were mine &nbsp; Gosh...these songs seriously messed with my emotional status today.&nbsp; I dont know, but everytime I seem to be urging myself to move a step forward, there is something from yester years which pulls me into a different mode altogether and I go on this..."what if things were so" routine!&nbsp; This is seriously painful for me, but then I guess its' something I have to go thro' and I know others too would be going thro the same....I'm not alone in this! &nbsp; Anyway, towards the late evening, I decided enough is enuogh of my weird routine and I pleaded with my parents and went for a drive.&nbsp; This drive though took me to a 108 Divya desam place called Thiruvinanur.&nbsp; Nice quaint temple near Chennai, about one hour's drive, that too mainly becoz of the traffic!&nbsp; Sat there in the temple for about 40 minutes, had a good dharshan and got back home at 9.&nbsp; Now I am quite tired..had a long chat with my friend and discussed life and it's wonders with him....was quite ironical, esp with him, coz over a year ago I was kindof in a situation where I was advising him on his love life, decisions which needed to be taken, why it had to be taken etc...and now I was in a situation where my personal and professional life is kindof a mess and I have little or no energy to figure my way out...am quite like in a maze right now....heres' hoping I find a way thro' this maze called life!&nbsp; Cheers! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Today was a serious case of nostalgia.&nbsp; Kept a bet with my boss this morning that I will find a way by which I will be able to set up an online survery tool which allows direct polling.&nbsp;  &nbsp; As I began the quest for the same, I was remembered of my days at my previous office.&nbsp; Those days when I used to sit for hours together and work with him and set up the intranet and then the online survey system.&nbsp; Cant forget the day when we founda bug and spent over 3 hours trying to find the error..gave up and later I found out that we had made an error in the setup.&nbsp; Quite a funny error which we made, but then the final product was a major success.&nbsp; Something I guess my previous office is now utilizing to the maximum ( thats ofcourse if they have the brains to understand its purpose...).&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway...so began my quest to figure out a survey program today.&nbsp; Sat for 2 hours this morning, couldnt find a single program to meet my expectations...guess I had too high ones coz of the last one which I set up at my previous office...no Idea. During the process I bumped into the software in PhP ESP easy software.&nbsp; Man, all the work which we did in setting this up, the ridiculous statements ppl made when we ventured out on this, etc...man, what memories.&nbsp; Had a look at the demo and thought how nice it would have been had I got some idea as to how to set this thing up.&nbsp; No one around here understands the meaning of PHP itself...quite sad...but then I guess thats something one will need to live with here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat going thro the demo, all I could see was the work we did to fix the survey, get this moving...and there I lost all hope of figuring out how to install this....Man, I would need to learn PHP itself to figure this one out... &nbsp; So I guess my search for another software for survey management will now begin again....wonder if there would be anything to meet my expectations....????

      Today was on tragic day in my life....finally the curtains had to draw a close on this show and the next show had to take over.  Sad, yes it is, but when considering the odds of an extension or a re run, haha, it was getting to be a comedy of errors.  As life treats me with an iron rod and I begin my journey towards the new horizon, I have learnt a few lessons...and have learnt it the really hard way...  1.  Never trust ppl....yes, I had said this before....but then there was someone who stole this principle from me and I had to share and then also put this on the back burner.....trust none, coz that gives you extreme pain and misery.  One day you will be happy and the next day you will feel like garbage!  2.  Pack your emotions aside...yes, me the romantic and ever open yourself up person is saying this.  Never allow your emotions to rule you, always rule over your emotions. Emotions just kill you and choke the daylights out of you.  Before you know you will find yourself in the morgue of misery, counting each of the moments you gave into your emotions and wrecked your peace and sanity!  3.  Extreme care with words...This has always been a principle with me, have never let myself down with this and never intend to ever do so too!  Always give one answer for 4 questions, never say something too nice or too harsh to ppl, coz they will twist it around and make you look like an absolute idiot.  4.  Never allow ppl to say " dont think about I first "....always think about I...I is important, never let yourself down. The minute you let yourself down you are assured of one thing, ppl will treat you like a door mat and slam you across the floor with zero mercy!  5.  Never be nice to ppl...Ppl always mistake niceity and at the end of the day, you will find yourself mopping your own tears. People will care for you till they get what they want, the minute they have achieved that you are useless material and they forget about your existence!  All these things are really hard to say...but believe me..after I went thro a rollacoaster today..I have learn tthigns the hard and very bitter way...GOD SAVE ME...pls....take away this misery...take away this pain...I cant take this anyone...why so much hate and misery in my life..what did I do to deserve this!   I dont know if I will ever get answers for these questions...but I do know one thing....this pain will teach me a bitter lesson for life and I will never ever make these mistakes again...and if I do...I think I will rest assure myself, that will be the last time I write a blog in my life!

      This is something I had on my Website..and has made a huge impact in quite a few of my friends lives..coz they used this to decide whether or not they were in love...  Does your heart ache and break when they're sad? Then it's love.  Do you cry for their pain, even when they're strong? Then it's love.  Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's love.  Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you there? Then it's love.  Do you accept their faults because they're a part of who they are? Then it's love.  Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret?Then it's love.   Would you allow them to leave you, not because they want to but because they have to? Then its love.  Would you give them your heart, your life, your death? Then it's love.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? Why is it all we search for in life? This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for? This torture, this powerful death of self? Why? The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE. It is such an addiction that even people who are not having it wish to experience and share it with .

      Last night was a major pain for me, the weather was too good and I thought I would be a pleasant night for me.  Haha...so much for that thought, coz it was anything but that!  The muggy weather coupled with a feeling of emptiness overtook me last night.  All I did was watch the ceiling for about 2 hours and then I guess the feeling of emptiness overtook me and I feel asleep.  Hardly 3 hours later I woke up again to the splatter of the rain on the window pane.  What a beautiful sight, complete black and empty all around and only the moon kissing against the stars and the smell of wet sand overtaking my senses.  Watching this sight for a few minutes and I could only remember the time when I had gone for a drive down the ECR, it was raining heavily, so the car had to pull over for a while and wait.  It was so pleasant to see the rain splatter onto the wind shield and run down the same. The clean green leaves and the swaying trees in the rain...gosh, still remember that sight as it was yesterday.    Once again, sleep over powered me and I slept for 1 hour this time, only to be woken up by the noises of the bed creaking.  Woke up at 4am this morning....loitered around the house and finally gave up trying to sleep for that night.  Got ready for the gym at 5am and then went and spend some time with my grandparents.  Different feeling to spend time with them in the morning...fresh and easy. Began my walk to the gym this morning, was quite a pleasant feeling,clear and crisp air blew past me and the heaviness began to lift up and out of my system.  Once I got to the gym, things became a lot better, worked out real hard....gosh, the pains of overweight!  Was feeling a  little low before getting to office this morning, dad wasnt around in town today to talk to,and mom aint really ready to listen to my blabber.  So just had to lock my thoughts away, keep a smile and head to office.  Office has been quite depressing so far....quality issues are bobbing me down big time and the feeling of emptiness is now starting to grow back into my system.  Pre Jan 03,my life was perfect, not a level of commitment, unhappiness, anger, etc to deal with and now its a pack of emotions rolled into a jigsaw puzzle which seems to have enough of pieces missing!  When will I find the missing pieces????  I wish I had some idea about this...:(

      Today I did a little research on what makes a relationship tick....  1.  Trust : Without this there is nothing called a relation between two people. Trust emcompasses "us".  2.  Belief : This is not blind belief but a belief which comes out of understanding the person to the extent that there should not be a reason for the other partner to even wonder if there is an underlying meaning to something and takes things at face value.  3.  Ego : If there is an ego in any relationship between two people, only one thing can be a sure thing in this....the relationship is heading straight down the drain.  In a relationship, the mere thought of an ego cannot exist and one needs to bare their soul to the other person.  One can never think in terms of "I", every thought has to be "us" or "we"!  4.  Boundaries : Boundaries fix the end point of your relationship.  Love is boundless, so by putting a boundary for the same or a timeline, one would be curtailing their feelings and allowing time to take a precedence over love.  5.  Past : Past plays a very important role in any relationship.  One needs to make peace with their past before moving to any other relationship.  Without accepting one's past, one always carries the baggage forward and messed the forthcoming relationships.  Then comes the comparision factor, which wrecks any relationship.  Each case is as unique as a finger print.  Comparision will only bring to light the strains of the past.  6.  Time out/ Breaks : This can be a plus as well as a minus in a relationship.  Minus in the sense that people make misuse this time to check out other options and then take a call on the current relationship.  This in reality does not help, but infact confuses the situation and adds a new dimension to ones' already confused mind and soul!  The plus of taking a break/ break, allows one to take a step back and understand the beauty of the relationship.  One never understands the beauty of a relationship while in it, its only when one takes a step back/ out and looks at things from an outsider perspective does one feel ready to accept the pitfalls and the compromises both partners have made towards the relationship.  7.  Coaching : As strange as it may sound, coaching is an essential part of a relationship.  Without the process of continous learning in the relationship, the excitement in the relationship is lost and what one has is just two people trying to cling onto each other because they are not prepared to let go and give each other space to understand themselves and their partner.  Coaching becomes extremely important in a relationship especially when the relationship is moving through a period of turbulence.  It is in period of turbulence that one should not take a decision to step away from the situation, but instead try to guide the other person to the shores close by.  This process of marooning a person in the time of need, infact turns out to be the first steps of moving away from the partner. The relationship needs to be given the time and space to grow, after all its' like a baby which needs to sit up, then have a steady head, then turn over, then crawl, stand, walk, etc.  Each step has an unique joy and moving thro' each level is what brings the two people together.  8.  Anger & Aggression : When one is trying to work towards building a relationship, being aggressive and trying to force an issue will never help.  There is a saying, "time and tide waits for none", exactly on those lines, when one tries to shift gears in a relationship before it is ready to move to the next level, the relationship heads no where, and infact move down a gear in reality.  Controlled aggression is the way to building a relationship.  Anger will never help in exhausting the pain, its only sweet words or atleast words said in a diplomatic manner which will help.  A person blinded by anger never gets to understand the true meaning of ones' thoughts, and as result never conveys the meaning which is actually intended.  As a result, all the good thoughts and intentions, goes down the drain!  9.  Commitment & Consistency : This is an important key to unlock the box of happiness in any relationship.  Once this is broken, there is not a locksmith in the world which can find a key to match that particular lock.  Unflinching commitment, even in the worst of the circumstances is what gives belief to one's partner and more than anything makes one's partner actually show more love and affection towards them.  One has to stay consistent in a relationship.  In a relationship between two people where there is no blood relationship, its the words and actions which bind the two people together.   Words and actions once executed will always leave their scars on a relationship, atleast in the subconscious mind.  10.  Respect : The most important aspect of any relationship is the respect which the concerned have for each other.  Respect governs the heart and soul. Respect is the corner stone, once lost, takes a very long time to be earned!  I personally believe that relationship between two people who are not connected by a blood relationship is always a fragile one.  Without a good understanding of ones' partner on a deeper and not superficial level, the relationship has no binding at all.    Any building needs a strong foundation......no use of having the strongest pillars, best of the concrete, best of the architectural designs.......reinforcements will never help!

      The last one week has been a bit of a revelation for me. For starters I began to understand a few things about myself, work, etc.  I began to come to peace with my life and the confusion I have been undergoing.  Yday I had a long chat with a close friend of mine, a person who had just begun the process of picking up the lost pieces in life and moving on.  Quite a strange chat with the person, coz we both we in kindof the same boat really.  But then we kindof had some level of commonality in all of that, the pain.  Yes, the pain was bad and it was touching new limits, but then is this pain really something which is paramount that we both make such a big issue over.  Yes, emotional attachment is tough to handle, but is this as bad as a loss of a blood relation with whom you have spent a lifetime with?  For the last two days, I have been doing quite a bit of thinking on this, imagine the pain a parent goes thro on losing their child, their treasure given by god.  Is that pain really anytime to compare with a bond which is created by destiny for whatsoever the purpose which brings together two individuals from different backgrounds?  Its just an emotional commitment in this case, yes, it is deep but is this as deep as that of a blood relation?    What pain a mother who has a baby growing in her will feel if she loses the child at any stage of the pregancy?  I can hardly imagine the devastation she would go thro in this, it could be quite blinding.  Comparing that, is there really any pain in what we are going thro over a relationship which has lasted just a few months or years?    How does one really understand the importance of their relationship?  Well, its not something which will come out of material aspects but the immaterial aspects only of the relationship.  The amount of immaterial aspects one sows in the relationship is what makes the relationship a sound one. Relationship has no strings attached to it, coz the bond of a true relationship runs much much much better, so deep that one can only say, there is a connection, but cannot say what really bind them together.  It is an unwritten bond between two people which defines a relationship, their belief and trust stands are two pillars in this, without either of this ,one has no right to even call the relationship by that name...coz it is actually minus those aspects and it becomes an agreement.    Life is defined by relationships...some with names, some without....which matters, when it matters, what love and affection comes from where...quite a weird thing to define...but one thing is for sure..if you are in a relationship and you want to test the nature of your relationship...take a step back...and take an outsider perspective of things, thats where you will understand what is the nature of your relationship.  One always needs a reality dose when it comes to relationships, so no use not accepting the faults on the relationship. life is all about relationships, the more you understand them, the better and stronger relationships you get urselves into.

      So far thursday has been an interesting day.&nbsp; Its kindof been a mixed bag really...  First the bad stuff...my body ache is starting to climb on me again, and the idiotic stomach prob aint settling, so the medicines have to continue..boohoo...hate that stuff, coz its killing my appetite big time!&nbsp; Am just hoping that my body ache settles down so that my trip for the next three days doesnt get wrecked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, the popping the pills session will need to go on for a while...as much as I hate it!&nbsp;   Good stuff now....hmm, I found a guardian angel,who kindof gave me a solution to my php program, but then the software works on all systems, but mine...:(( Seriously depressing!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, am hoping to somehow find a way to make this work.&nbsp; Kindof reminds me of the days I sat with him and slogged it out with this software trying to dig out a bug and make it work.&nbsp; Finally found out that it was one stupid marker which we had ticked by mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping that this prob will get solved and will have the software working on my system soon, else I lose my bet...boohoo!  Today the first steps have been taken towards my team integration, and am hoping that this will make some sense in life and wont be yet another flop show.&nbsp; Because if its'a flop show, there is more to lose than gain in this!&nbsp;   Need to go and purchasea gift for my dad today, wondering what to get him.&nbsp; This time we will be visiting his ruling deity temple on his birthday, so am super happy over that.&nbsp; Am praying that this trip goes off well for everyone, coz it's a trip which will hopefully bring back the happiness to my entire family!  &nbsp;

      Well, this was supposed to have been entered yday, but couldnt do it coz I was down with a severe headache and a touch of a fever building on me.&nbsp; Really struggled thro the day and closed the doors finally in the evening.&nbsp; A person like me, who hates to hit the bed before 10, fell asleep at 8:30, man, this must have been history in the making!  Anyway, the day as a whole was quite depressing, hardly was able to conquer my hurt & pain and the headache and body ache kindof added that extra dimension to the misery.&nbsp; In all, one seriously depressing day in my life..coz I felt emptiness at the very max today.  I have always wondered what it would be to be marooned on an island and have to live a few days there.&nbsp;It kindof feels to be a good thing...maybe a few days of solitude will help me forget these unanswered questions and move on with life??&nbsp; I dont know really, but then the more I think about it, I doubt I will ever get answers to my questions.  The only good news I got for the day was my close friend from Dubai was getting hitched finally, to her senior from Philly..and to top things off, she's getting married two days after her bro..and the wedding is at chennai.&nbsp; So I guess it's gonna be party time in teh 3rd week of August for me...four days of fun and frolic!&nbsp; I just hope the marriage blues will leave me by that time...:)

      Life has turned out to be quite ironical so far with me.&nbsp; It gave me the best, saw to that I gave back the best to life and now has kindof left me in a situation where I am wondering where was I all this while...in my dreams or in reality?  Currently I am trying to move out of stranded phase, where I want to leave the past and move to the future.&nbsp; What to do, how to do ...where do I begin?&nbsp; Well, a set of interesting questions, but I think the answer really lies within me.&nbsp; I need to take that initiative and move on with stuff.&nbsp; There is simply no use holding onto something which gives one pain and hurt.&nbsp;  Yesterday I was watching the movie paycheck, and there was an interesting statement made in that.."life is a sum of all our mistakes".&nbsp; Quite ironical, but then, its true.&nbsp; Everytime we make a mistake, we learn from it and try not to make the same mistake again.&nbsp; When we commit the same mistake the second time, we learn a new lesson.&nbsp; The process of learning never ends, its an ongoing cycle.  Life cannot stop for anyone, its' not the way of the world.&nbsp; Time governs us all, and this time only knows when and what will happen.&nbsp; You can dodge your destiny upto a point, after which it will come and bite you and when it does, you might even repent for having dodged it the first time.  As I initiate myself in the process of embracing my past, closing out the questions which haunt me and terrify me, all I pray is that the almighty stands by me again thro this process and gives me the courage to survive this.

      Today was slightly different from other days in my life...esp over what I've been going thro' over the last two weeks. &nbsp; Got a bad stinker from one of the clients and had another breathing fire down my throat.&nbsp; Was a very different situation to work in.&nbsp; Not that my recruiters were firing all guns, hardly even remotely close to that. It's almost as though everyone at office had gone into snooze mode.&nbsp; I was in aworld of my own, trying to work my way thro' some quality issues which have been pending overtime.&nbsp; Had a long chat with my australian &amp; singaporein counterpart today and got an insight into myself, kindof forced them to do a little bit of an analysis on me.&nbsp; Was quite an interesting process as they said some stuff about me which made me sit up and wonder, hmmm, not bad, I have left an impression on ppl..;) &nbsp; Anyways, as the day rolled by, my past began to dance infront of me over and over again.&nbsp; Was having a tough time controlling my thought process.&nbsp; Everytime I waivered, I had to literally knock some sense into myself, kindof like a jolt of reality and come down to earth.&nbsp; Must say, a pretty painful process considering the amount of force I had to exert onto myself to block my thoughts. &nbsp; As office drew to a close, I began typing my previous days' blog on my sunday trip to Knachipuram.&nbsp; Was a nice trip, pretty nostalgic.&nbsp; Dad came to pick me up, was nice having a daugther and father chat after a long time really.&nbsp; Discussed my mental framework and current situation, how to make the best of what I have left and what I can make for my future.&nbsp; Painful thoughts as I had to accept certain things, my negativity which I had been blocking for months together began to come to the fore front and I was kindof hanging on to a thread which was slowly giving way.&nbsp; I was beginning to exhibit signs of loneliness,unhappiness, digust, pain, anger, frustration and every ther negative emotions which a human can feel.&nbsp; This was just not me, but this pain and misery was beginnng to take a toll on me. I need to work my way out of this, but I dont know how to.&nbsp; I think what I really need a tthe moment is some sound sleep, one of the many things&nbsp; I have lost oflate.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Here's hoping for a peaceful night of sleep and hopefully a better day tomorrow! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well, this was supposed to be my blog for yday but due to the pausity of the computer, last evening, I couldnt upload this. &nbsp; As usual, I had to fight for the computer, but then for a change I lost the fight this time around.&nbsp; Hmm...wonder if this is a new trend...hope not! &nbsp; So what was my sunday like, well, I guess this is how my sunday's are probably going to be spent by me for a few more months...haha! &nbsp; Woke up at 6am, and had to wash my hair...couldnt wash it on saturday coz it was amavasya, sooooo many rules!!! Anyway, once that ordeal was over, I had to rush and get ready for our temple trip.&nbsp; This weekend was&nbsp;more focussed on temples around Chennai.&nbsp; Todays' trip was to Kanchipuram.&nbsp; Quite a nice place, known as the temple town, it kindof lost a lot of its shine as the temple town and is now the official saree capital!&nbsp;  &nbsp; But then, the temples are still among the best and most beautiful ones.&nbsp; First, in the series of temples was at this place called Tirupakozhi.&nbsp; This is a very nostalgic temple for my family as this is the place where my maternal grandma came over, offered some prayers and after which my uncle was concieved.&nbsp; Infact my uncle is named after this temple deity, Vijayaraghavan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular temple has a tradition where women who are unable to concieve, take a dip in the tank at the temple premises, collect some green gram, roast it and then bundle it in a moist muslin cloth and have it placed on their tummy and knotted up.&nbsp; As normal scientific knowledge would say, once roasted, the pulse should not sprout, but as per the tradition here, this pulse will sprout if the woman is blessed by the deity, Managathavalli Thaiyar.&nbsp; Quite strange as it sounds, but since I have seen a few cases comes thro with this, I dont have much choice but to believe in the same. &nbsp; Next stop was a temple called Yadotkara.&nbsp; This is a strange temple, coz it has a lot of relation with a temple down south near Kumbakonam.&nbsp; The lord is supposed to have got angry at one of the kings and come to this place.&nbsp; Here he grants his devotee a set of wishes, so the lord here is called Sunna Vannukm Perumal.&nbsp; Amazing Andal here, really quite gorgeous a deity. &nbsp; Next Stop was at this place within Kanchipuram, called Tupur, this is the place where Vendanta Desikar is supposed to have been born and initiated his religious discourse.&nbsp; Yet, another beautiful temple with an amazing explaination.&nbsp; Here is the place where I learnt the meaning of Kanchi puram - Bhrama's home, and the meaning of Rameshwaram - meeting place of rama and Shiva, and the meaning of Kasi - the meeting of Light and Bhrama. &nbsp; We were to close the trip with a stop at Varadaraja Temple, but courtesy of some guy jumping into the temple tank, the temple doors were being closed as we entered the temple.&nbsp; Anyway, this temple I guess wasnt in our agenda for the trip, so no problem, will be visited in the next round. &nbsp; Then came lunch at 13:30, was feeling too full and droggy, think the medication which Iwas on was taking effect.&nbsp; So, just had a milkshake and tried to settle my stomach.&nbsp; The weather was quite bad yday and our drive back was made miserable with the innumerable broken and patched roads. &nbsp; Once I reached home, it had to be rest and relaxation time.&nbsp; So, ola, DVD time.&nbsp; This evening, it was a movie called " save the last dance ".&nbsp; I think I am hooked to movies which revolve around dance and music.&nbsp; I think my interest in dance is on the up and probably I need to join back my dance classes and add some spice or shall I say salsa/ jive&nbsp;to my life. Nice movie, since I enjoyed the music, dance and ofcourse the story was built up decently. &nbsp; Later in the evening, it was off to the club, where to my surprise I got to watch the cricket match on a giant screen.&nbsp; Yeah, the match was lousy and I guess was lost in the first few overs of India's innings.&nbsp; Got back home by 10, and hit the bed...wasnt feeling too well..think all the medication is now starting to go ahead of me..and drain me out...anyway, here's hoping my stomach gets to normality soon.&nbsp; Its quite a pain to lose one's appetite especially when you love food. &nbsp;

      Just a few minutes ago, was listening to this song from Robbie William, one of my favourites, kindof slipped away into my own world hearing it...  I sit awake There's an angel Contemplate my fate  And do we know The places where we go When we're gray and old'  Cause I have been told That salvation lets their wings unfold  So when I'm lying in my bed thoughts running through my head and I feel that love is dead I'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead  When I'm feeling weak And my pain walks down A one way streetI look about And I know I'll always be blessed with luck  And as the feeling grows She breathes flesh to my bones And when love is deadI'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead  And through it all She offers me protection A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong  And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me When I come to call She won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead!

      First and foremost, what the hell is this "space" one talks about?  Well, this is something which different in a man's and a woman's perspective...  For men, if they say they want space, it usually means, I think I am getting bored, and need to check out some other women before I decide you are the one...this is a 90% probability situation, while for the other 10% , space simply means, you're nagging me just too much, I dont know if I can out with this for too long, so give me a break, let me return to sanity, and then come back to you!  For women, on the other hand means, let me think whats going wrong in our relationship and see if it can be fixed at all, this is 95% of the cases, and yes, theres' that 5% who use this cliche excuse to check out other men!  Why this difference in the meaning?&nbsp; Simply from the inherant nature of men and women...women tend to take more responsibility for the direction of the relationship, which is why, in most cases when a breakup happens, women tend to go thro' much more pain and misery than a man.&nbsp; It's kindof a situation like there's this part of them which is been removed from their system, something which they have nurtured and cared for.&nbsp;   So now, this brings us to the quesiton, why is the space so important in a relationship?&nbsp;   I would say with&nbsp;some level of affirmity, that without this space between a man and a woman in a relationship, things will simply get too hot to handle and instead of colourful sparks flying around, it becomes colourful remarks!&nbsp; Relationships are something like sugar, heat it in a spoon, first it liquifies, then it starts to bubble with energy, then it gradually changes colours, yellow..to light brown..to dark brown, then it gradually changes it consistency, and starts to come out like pines and needles.&nbsp; At this point, if removed you get to make the best of the bases for ice cream servings, but if you dont and continue to heat the spoon of sugar, the sugar turns black, it gets smoky and then turns into tar!&nbsp;   Just like sugar, when one gives the relationship, enough space and time to grow it becomes a beautiful base or even the basis for making the best of pralines, but if not given the right space and time, it turns into a bed of tar!  Space helps people realise the true value of their relationship.&nbsp; Its' not a case of simply taking a break and thinking, oh my I have taken a break, is the guy/ girl checking out other ppl, but instead thinking, right, where is my relationship now, is it heading anywhere, where are the areas of concerns, can it be fixed, if it cant be fixed, how to work around it, etc.&nbsp; If one is able to take a third person perspective of the relationship during this break time, its' the best antidote which can be provided to a shaky or volatile relationship.  Give your partner that space, understand what is the meaning of your relationship, then you will have it in you to understand the true magic of the relationship!

      For many years thro' my childhood, I always wondered, what makes a person,"a special" person.&nbsp;   Thro' my schooling years, I had been travelling a lot, so never got to really check out my school mates well enough&nbsp;or make friends who has lasted beyond those years in that particular school.&nbsp; I had seen all my friends running around with their boyfriends, passing comments on the guys as they stood over 100m away, etc, but never could figure out what really makes a person attain a new height of a "special" friend.  After very many years of pondering, keenly watching women and men go crazy over each other, I think I have come to a point where I can atleast contribute to this topic now..  So here are the 10 reasons I beleive justify elevating a person to a "special" person category:  1. Trust : This is not something which drops out of the heavens, and is a value which needs to be truely earned at each and every level.  2. Selflessness : Putting "you" infront of "i", this makes a world of difference!  3.&nbsp; Dependability: When the entire world has shut it's doors on your face, you there's one person whom you can always turn you.  4.&nbsp; Advicer : This probably be the one and only person whom one will be able to digest any comment, whether nasty, sarcastic or developmental. This person is always a constructive critic!  5.&nbsp; Emotional Support : Irrespective of the nature of the problem, however personal it is, this is the one person with whom you should feel that you at letting down your burden from your heart.  6.&nbsp; Meaning of Time : Time will not stand in the way of anything.&nbsp; Whatever the time, time period, this is the one person whom you can count on to be there around you.  7.&nbsp; Respect : Irrespective of whether the entire world shuns you, this person still holds you with all the respect, mainly because they trust you to no end at all!  8.&nbsp; Determination: The power being able to focus ones' engry to hold things in a particular manner, and the ability to strive from there on towards the goal post with you, is what defines determination!  9.&nbsp; Smile : As trivial as it sounds, a smile is something which is necessary to keep any relationship happy!&nbsp; The power of positive vibes is more than enough to scare away all those fears and stupidity from your heart!  10.Commitment : The ability to stand against all odd and support you in the worst of adversities, provides just that rounded touch to any relationship!

      A girl in love asked her boyfriend..   Girl: Tell me... who do you love most in this world? Boy: You, of course! &nbsp;Girl: In your heart, what am I to you? Boy: The boy thought for a moment and looked intently in her eyes and&nbsp; said, "You are my rib. In the Bible, it was said that God saw that Adam waslonely, during his sleep; God took one of Adam's rib and created Eve. Every&nbsp; man has been searching for his missing rib, only when you find the woman ofyour life; you'll no longer feel the lingering ache in your heart."   After their wedding, the couple had a sweet and happy life for a while.However, the youthful couple began to drift apart due to the busy scheduleof life and the never-ending worries of daily problems...Their life became mundane. All the challenges posed by the harshrealities of life began to gnaw away their dreams and love for each&nbsp; other... The couple began to have more quarrels and each quarrel became more&nbsp; heated.   One day, after the quarrel, the girl ran out of the house....&nbsp; At the opposite side of the road, she shouted, "You don't love me!"&nbsp; The boy hated her childishness and out of impulse, retorted, "Maybe, it&nbsp; was a mistake for us to be together! You were never my missing rib!"  Suddenly, she turned quiet and stood there for a long while....&nbsp; He regretted what he said but words spoken are like thrown away water,you can never take it back. With tears, she went home to pack her things and was determined in&nbsp; breaking-up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Before she left the house, "If I'm really not your missing rib, pleaselet me go.... She continued, "It is less painful this way... Let us go on&nbsp; our separate ways and search for our own partners..."  Five years went by.... He never remarried but he had tried to find out&nbsp; about her life indirectly......&nbsp; She had left the country and back.... She had married a foreigner and divorced... He felt anguished that she never waited for him. In the dark and lonely&nbsp; night, he lit his cigarette and felt the lingering ache in his heart. He couldn't bring himself to admit that he was missing her.&nbsp;   One day, they finally met.... At the airport, a place where there were many reunions and good-byes... He was going away on a business trip. She was standing there alone, with just the security door separating&nbsp; &nbsp;them.She smiled at him gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Boy: How are you? Girl: I'm fine. How about you... Have you found your missing rib?  Boy: No. Girl: I'll be flying to New York in the next flight. Boy: I'll be back in 2 weeks time. Give me a call when you are back...You know my number... Nothing has changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;  With a smile, she turned around and waved "Good-bye."  One week later, he heard of her death. She had perished in New York. In&nbsp; the event that shocked the world... Midnight..... Once again, he lit his cigarette...And like before, he felt the lingering ache in his heart...He finally knew, she was the missing rib that he had carelessly broken.   Sometimes, people say things out of moments of fury... Most often than&nbsp; not, the outcome could be disastrous and detrimental....   We vent ourfrustrations 99% at our loved ones... And even though we know that we ought&nbsp; to "think twice and act wisely", it's often easier said than done.  Things happen each day, many of which are beyond our control. Let us&nbsp; treasure every moment and everyone in our lives.  Tomorrow may never come; give and accept what you have today.&nbsp;   Hope you all treasuring your own Ribs!!!

       Mistakes are inevitable---we're all only human.    WHAT IF YOU ARE THE SOURCE OF THE MISTAKE. . . .  If you are the source of the mistake, these steps will assist with a speedy recovery, and will serve to build and strengthen the relationship for the future.   A. HONESTY. Be honest and forthright about your role in the mistake.  B. RESPONSIBILITY. Take responsibility for what has happened, and take the initiative to communicate this to others involved.  C. CLEAN-UP. Own your negative impact on the person or situation. Take steps, in consultation with those affected, to alleviate the problem or damage. A genuine apology, if called for, goes a long way toward mending the effects of a mistake. Make your sorry meaningful and not say it for the sake of saying it! D. ADDRESS FUTURE PREVENTION. Discuss what worked and didn't work in the specific situation surrounding the mistake, to learn how to avoid or minimize future problems.  E. LET GO AND MOVE ON. Let yourself and others off the hook.&nbsp;Allow the slate to be wiped clean.   WHAT IF YOU ARE THE "VICTIM" OF A MISTAKE. . . . A. Go directly to the source for resolution. Don't clam up and then harbor silent and negative assumptions or judgments. Don't merely complain to others who are not in a position to or may not want to help resolve the matter.  B. Honor a code of personal behavior: be respectful, honest and descriptive as you confront the situation; avoid negative characterizations and conclusive statements---these usually just throw fuel on the fire.  C. Avoid assigning motive or meaning to the mistake until you have a chance to check your assumptions with the source.  D. Do share both your feelings on the matter and how the mistake negatively impacted you and/or others.   Learn to accept mistakes as a part and parcel of your life, there is no use running away from taking up the necessary responsibility for the mistake , it will never leave you in peace!&nbsp; Accept the mistake, accept reality, and dont' go about the rest of your life punishing yourself and others!&nbsp;  Accept things graceful, thats what a true human being does!  Say SORRY, there is nothing wrong in it, the world will not capsize under your own feet!

      This is a short story which I read some time ago in my college or what it in school, dont remember when it was...something about taking a slap/ bite of reality!  We tend to take our blessings for granted, like the story about a homeowner who hired a real-estate agent to prepare an ad to sell his home.   The homeowner was reading the ad in the paper about his home's many attractive features.  He called the real-estate agent to say he no longer wished to sell. When asked what changed his mind, the homeowner said, "After reading your ad, I realized I already live in the house I always wanted to live in."  I guess most people understand the value of others only after they lose or almost lose what means the most to them!&nbsp; The difference in life is made when one decides to hold on to something which means the world to them , fight it out and not be held back by one's ego!&nbsp; It takes a lifetime to get over stuff when you lose something so dear to your heart!

      My blog could never be complete without this all time favourite song of mine... the intoxication power of Love!  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand  I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  I dream of fire  Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire And in the flames Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire  This desert rose Each of her veils, a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  And as she turns This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams This fire burnsI realize that nothing's as it seems  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  I dream of rain I lift my gaze to empty skies aboveI close my eyes  This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love   I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in pain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  Sweet desert rose Each of her veils, a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  Sweet desert rose This memory of Eden haunts us all This desert flower  This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the love

      For ages, have been a huge fan of the Beegees, mainly for their lyrics.&nbsp; One of their songs, which seems to be quite apt to what I have been going thro' for the last few weeks is kindof encompassesed in this song:  Breakout   It don't matter who you are  Anyone can be a star Brighter than the lightning You go as far as you go  You got to be what you know   There may be somebody out to get the better of you  You need the one good woman to keep you alive  Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head  Remember nobody left you on the railway line And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time   Breakout Ain't no one gonna break your heart &nbsp;You'll never do it if you never start &nbsp;You be there Breakout now  You gotta be a story told  And baby , no one gonna steal your soul  You be there If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  You've got it all and then you're lost in flight   There are diamonds in the street  But you don't get enough to eat  Walking on a wire  There is a future unknown  Nobody does it alone   (break)  And maybe you can be the thunder  If you follow your dream  There must be one good woman to show you the way  Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are  Remember , somebody calls you on the telephone line and all the world gets crazy and you win this time   Breakout   Ain't no one gonna break your heart  You'll never do it if you never start  You be there Breakout now  You gotta be the story told  And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul  You be there  If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  You've got it all and then you're lost in flight  Breakout now  Ain't no one gonna break your heart  You'll never do it if you never start be there !!!

      Quite interesting how the blogs are now becoming a mode of communication...a simple tool with which someone is able to express their feelings and add clarity to their lives...  Yet again, I had problems posting stuff on someone's comments page, I thought okay, anyway I need to update my blog, so why not address certain issues in this ....  1.&nbsp; Temple visiting bringing peace: anything with god for a truly religious person, will bring peace to one's heart to a good extent.&nbsp; But there is a&nbsp; saying that God helps only those who help themselves.&nbsp; One needs to truly believe in their heart and mind, that they can find peace, only then will they ever get close to that.  2.&nbsp; Trying to mend fences : well, this is something which I can do if I had a reason to do so, but right now I see no rhyme or reasoning coming from the other side of the fence to mend this.&nbsp; Anyway, as said by someone some time ago, certain lessons learnt can cause a lot of pain and grief to people, and trying to implement the changes will only make others experience more pain and misery.&nbsp; This is somethign which I dont think certain people are upto to facing up to!  3.&nbsp; Moving on in life : Its' just a process, one needs to try to take an initiative towards moving on in life, you cant wait for life to thrust something onto you to make your life.&nbsp; Unlike someone, I aint got people hounding them with horoscopes, photos of puny & cute women, ads, trips, training, etc, all I have is my work, workout at the club, trips out of chennai and my music.&nbsp; I am trying to find solace in this and am quite aware that this is going to be long process, but I need to make an effort towards this, coz I cant run away from this!  4.&nbsp; Memories : For someone who has been in love, that too true love, its far too tough and also not exactly humanly possible to forget these good memories. If one is able to forget these memories, it only shows the commitment they had to the relationship.&nbsp;   Today, after nearly 7 years, I went back to the swimming pool, was shit scared to get in, and felt oh my, I might just drown if I get into the deep end.&nbsp; This was the thought which was ringing in my head from my office to before changing at swimming pool dressing room.&nbsp; As I was changing, I began to wonder, hmm, I have swam before, learnt the art well enough, yeah I lost touch, so , does that mean I will drown if I set foot in the water...???&nbsp;&nbsp; I then decided, no more idiotic thoughts in my head, I will get into the deep end and swim across to the shallow end and back.&nbsp; In addition to this fear, I had this fear that, oh my what if I look depressing in my swim suit and people give me the stares.&nbsp; Another stupid thought which just filled my head, which I simply decided to overcome, and yes, I did check things out in the mirror before I got into the pool...geez I wasnt exactly a hippo and more than anything I believed in myself that I was taking steps to drop my weight, and this was good for me, so no use running away from it.&nbsp; Got into the pool, had a shaky start, had a little tough time getting to the other end, but within 10 minutes I was back to normalcy and could feel my body moving like a fish.&nbsp; How did this come, simple, coz I believe that my heart and mind are co operating with me, and also feel that I am doing the right thing, and nothing wrong at all!  Life is about choices, the choices we make may appear to make or break our lives, but usually the choices we turn down find a way of coming back to us later on in life, in a differnt wrapper....its' just the way you see life!&nbsp;   Wear your belief on your shoulder, trust yourself and you'll realise the world has a lot to offer, and there are a zillion people around you wanting to know you more!

      Last week, I had the chance to watch this movie Flash Dance, after a really really long time...one amazing movie which revolves around one's belief to succeed in their dreams, and never give up....the road will always be there, just get onto the road, and get travelling...This is one of the songs in that movie, lovely liberating lyrics to dance to!  First, when there's nothing but a slow glowing dream  That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind  All alone I have cried silent tears full of pride  In a world made of steel, made of stone   Well I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm  Wrap around, take a hold of my heart   Chorus:  What a feeling, bein's believin' I can't have it all, now I'm dancin' for my life  Take your passion, and make it happen &nbsp;Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life (Solo)  Now I hear the music, close my eyes,  I am rhythm In a flash it takes hold of my heart   chorus (with ... "now I'm dancing through my life")   What a feeling What a feeling (I am music now),  bein's believin' (I am rhythm now) P ictures come alive, you can dance right through your life  What a feeling (I can really have it all)  What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call)  I can have it all (I can really have it all) &nbsp;Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call)  (call, call, call, call, what a feeling)&nbsp;I can have it all &nbsp;(Bein's believin')&nbsp;bein's believin'  (Take your passion, make it happen) make it happen  (What a feeling) what a feeling... (to fade) !

      This was one of the songs which I grew up listening to...Dolly Parton, the queen of country music, and one lady who stood for making her dreams in the worst of the situations...  To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)  There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn) And a time for every purpose, under Heaven  A time to be born, a time to die &nbsp;A time to plant, a time to reap  A time to kill, a time to heal  A time to laugh, a time to weep  To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)  There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn) And a time for every purpose, under Heaven  A time to build up, a time to break down  A time to dance, a time to mourn  A time to cast away stones, a time to gather stones together To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)  There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)  And a time for every purpose, under Heaven   A time of love, a time of hate  A time of war, a time of peace  A time you may embrace, a time to refrain from embracing To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)  There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)  And a time for every purpose, under Heaven  A time to gain, a time to lose  A time to rend, a time to sew  A time to love, a time to hate  A time for peace, I swear it's not too late!

      This is one lovely article which I had received a while ago in my egroup for Psychology...  Top Ten relationship wreckers!!!  1. Neglecting Your Partner (ignoring, workaholism, addictions):A primary function of a relationship is to provide companionship and to meet each other’s needs. When other activities, interests or preoccupations interfere with our availability, we can wind up short-changing our partner. This can be thought of as absenteeism. Taking an inventory and making adjustments in how we spend our time is the first step in correcting this problem. Treat your partner as the important person they are by spending enough quality time together to satisfy each of your requirements in this area and to maintain your connection.  2. Depriving Your Partner (not being attentive, expressive, affectionate, supportive, caring, loving):Being there physically is not enough. We cannot expect our relationship to thrive if we withdraw emotionally for extended periods of time. In order to be fully present, we must be aware of our partner and be willing to show how we feel both verbally and non-verbally. Expressing love though affection and caring behaviors are crucial to keeping a relationship strong and vibrant. Small regular doses of intimacy will usually suffice, and the most important times of day to communicate positively are upon waking, upon reuniting after a long day, and before going to sleep.  3. Dishonesty & Betrayal (infidelity, lying):Most people are aware that the foundation of any relationship is T-R-U-S-T. In no relationship is trust more important than in a relationship between mates, except for a parent and dependent child relationship. Cheating and lying breaks down the basis for a relationship, and often results in its demise. A problem of this nature is serious, and resolving it must be a top priority if the relationship is to survive.&nbsp;  4. Attacking Your Partner (blaming, abuse – physical, emotional, sexual):Aggressive communication is simply unacceptable, especially if the abuse is getting physical. Physical or sexual abuse are deal-breakers in a marriage/ relationship, and should prompt a permanent separation. The abusive partner needs to get professional help to learn skills in&nbsp;anger managemet, &nbsp;in order to gain and consistently demonstrate better control over his or her emotions and behavior. Even if the help is sought and progress is made, the risk of recurrence remains high, so in most cases, the abused partner should not return to the relationship. Returning serves to reinforce the abusive behavior, leading to increased severity and frequency of subsequent abuse. Instead, the abused partner should also seek help, and work through issues that have potential to lead one into another abusive relationship. Verbally blaming, accusing, and insulting your partner are less extreme forms of destructiveness, but are not OK either, and&nbsp;assertiveness training can provide the essential skills for healthy communication.  5. Scapegoating (taking your anger or frustration out on you partner):We all know that it’s not right to kick the dog after a hard day at work, so why do it to your partner? Being held responsible for things that are out of our control is the most stressful of conditions, and that is what we do to our partner when we scapegoat them. Rather than hurt the ones you love, do what it takes to meet the real problem head-on, as effectively as you can. If you are unsure of how to address a problem, the strong and mature thing to do is to ask for help and support from trusted sources (i.e., a friend, relative, or therapist).   6. Negativism (nitpicking, nagging, criticizing):In order to have a good relationship, the positives must outweigh the negatives by a large percentage. If negativity is creeping into your relationship, it is like water seeping into walls, eventually weakening the structure. People usually feel good around others who are upbeat and positive, as well as those who help them to feel good about themselves. Bringing a negative spirit into your relationship crowds out the positive. However, pushing aside or neglecting to address real problems is not the answer either, and can be just as harmful to relationship health as dwelling on the negative. So pick your battles wisely, strive to communicate effectively, and practice cooperative negotiation.  7. Gossiping (telling family or friends about your problems but not addressing them with your partner):That’s right, if you are talking about the problems in your relationship with friends or relatives but not working on improving the situation, that amounts to gossip. Gossip is not a productive way to handle problems, and can result in additional problems. For instance, your partner may feel betrayed that you revealed sensitive material to others that cause him or her to be embarrassed or uncomfortable around them. Also, if you promote a negative side of your partner or your relationship, others may get a distorted view, and changes in their attitudes and behavior may follow. Others may remember your conflicts long after you and your partner have gotten past them. Instead, work on improving your communication skills. Turn toward your partner, not away. If you need help, seek out the assistance of an objective third party such as a therapist who works with couples. When it comes to your needs, stop complaining and start asking!  8. Controlling Your Partner (“my way” or else, perfectionism, trying to change your partner, possessiveness):Wanting things to be a certain way and having preferences are completely natural and even healthy. However, when this tendency becomes extreme and starts to encroach on the rights, needs and desires of others, it can cause major havoc. Freedom of will and self-determination are basic needs, and when these are being threatened, negative reactions may include anger, resentment, and/or rebellion. If the need to control is a problem in your relationship, identify the motivations behind it and work towards dealing with those issues rather than acting them out with your partner.  9. Putting Yourself First (self-centeredness, selfishness, entitlement):It’s not “all about me,” folks. Letting one’s self interests take priority in an unbalanced way can be toxic to a partnership. The other person usually winds up feeling deprived, resentful, and unimportant. Furthermore, the more self-involved you are, the more you take your relationship for granted, the less you appreciate your partner, and the more alone you actually are. So if your relationship is slanted in this way, you also lose out, because you experience less of the joy that a true connection brings. You and you partner both get more from the relationship through reciprocity in giving and receiving.  10. Putting Yourself Last (self-neglect, passivity, self sacrifice):Martyrs are seldom happy. More often, they are angry, bitter, resentful, depressed and burned out. This is not to say that you should not consider others and be thoughtful in meeting their needs. But having a healthy relationship involves factoring your own needs and desires into the equation. You teach people how to treat you, and if you act like a doormat, you can’t completely blame someone if they wipe their feet on you. Learn how to stand up for yourself, practice assertive communication, ask and allow others to meet your needs, and take care of yourself as much as you take care of your loved ones.    What was wrong can often be made right:Problems can be used as lessons; we can choose to learn from them, and find a better way!

      Happiness is not something you postpone for thefuture;&nbsp;it is something you design for the present.  Happiness is not an accident. Nor is it something youwish for. Happiness is something you design. The greatest source of unhappiness comes from inside.  Happiness is the art of learning how to get joy from your substance.   Lets take for example our relationships -   If your relationship doesn't have adestination, how will you know when and where you reach ?   Good relationships are no accident. Tough times can strike any relationship - family, professional or friendship. But deciding to be responsible and 'happy' in practical ways can result in relationships that are tougher than tough times.  Think about this. We see around many couples want to"fix" problems, but don't know how to reach it.  The most common and most fundamental thing these couples are lacking is the knowledge that - happy relationships is a decision. If you look at it from this perspective, you'd agree that love is not a feeling of a particular moment but it's a decision.  Love is waking up every day committed to honoring yourpartner for being with you. If you want to have a great relationship, it's up to you. If you want to be happy, it's up to you!

      Its' the 26th of June 04...yet another day in everyone's life, but special in it's own way to each of our lives!  Today, after many days of controlling myself, I decided its' time to take courage and visit his blog and actually find out if he is posting stuff, or just reserving stuff for his "better" half!&nbsp; Well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he was actually pouring his heart out into a blog, just like me.&nbsp;   Quite a funny thing happend then, I was actually planning to write a blog today on astrology and draw instances from predications made by astrologers, his and mine, and I found a blog on the same topic in his.&nbsp; Haha...I guess we always have been jinxed when it came to the thought process.  As I was going thro' the blog, there were a few thoughts which came to my mind, and thought hey, okay lets post some comments, but what do I see, his comments option aint working...hmm..so much for the best software solutions!&nbsp;   Anyway, so I thought okay, maybe its' done on purpose, anyway, which ever the case is, I thought I'd post my comments on this page itself, since most of it pertain to me....hahaha...the ghost of chennai! ;)  1.&nbsp; Pain has a beauty about it, it comes when you least want it, and when you cant take it the most!&nbsp; Its' when one survives thro' this pain that they become a greater human being!&nbsp; There seriously aint any fun in shying again from this pain!  2.&nbsp; Astrology:  Haha..this probably is the biggest irony.&nbsp; A few days ago I had a little bit of any insight into this first hand, and really one cant say if it works or not.&nbsp; Btw, his astrologer said that if he got married, it would be of his choice, yeah..obviously this can also be interpretated as, even if an arranged marriage it's really the girl and the guy who have the final say!&nbsp; Jokes apart, astrology has its own way of governing our lives, as much as we hate to believe it, some stuff comes true, some wrecks our lives, some bring us sweet memories, etc.&nbsp;   3.&nbsp; Me, the wrecker: This probably is the best compliment I have got for days about myself.&nbsp; Well, for whatever I did do to contribute towards messing things up, I have taken responsibility for that, but there is little or not reason which I see where others have taken responsibility and shown magnanimity to accepting the same.&nbsp; Each of my blogs have been steps which I have taken towards punishing myself for whatever mistakes I may have commited.&nbsp; I know myself, I have been true to myself always and forever!  4.&nbsp; Forgetting stuff....hahaha..this is probably the icing on the cake.&nbsp; I was planning to write a blog on friday on how ppl, especially guys seem to be able to walk away from relationships without having any feelings towards what has been lost.&nbsp; Infact, if I remember right, that was the day I spoke to a few of our common friends and discussed this issue.&nbsp; Quite surprising ...but yet another misconception!&nbsp; Anyway, one thing which is clear for me is that....my memories are ones which I will always cherish, its' god given stuff...I had some of the best times in my life....sweet memories can never be forgotten or ever erased!  5.&nbsp; Misconceptions:&nbsp; So much for thinking that the other person was out of it!!!! Hahahaha...nice joke....memories cant even fade away too easily....its a very tough job..and more than anything one needs something must more herculean to be able to battle past one's memories!&nbsp;   6.&nbsp; Second phase of life...Arranged marriage...hmm...commitment, oops...words a normal sagitarrian will shudder to even mention...but then as a human being, one has to say the words one day!  7.&nbsp; Big yet small world...we all live in a big world..and yet it is small coz everyone finds a way of relating to each other..and more than anything....time has it's own way of bringing ppl to terms with it's twisted sense of humour!&nbsp; Paths will cross, destiny's path is something which is decided, its more a matter of choosing to walk on the road or on the footpath!

      This is a poem which was sent to me years ago...never actually figured out the meaning of this till&nbsp; this morning.... I sure do see a lot more meaning to this now...  Sometimes clouds cover the sun.&nbsp;  But when the go away, the sun is always there. Sometimes rain and storm cover the sun. Again, when the rain goes away, you see the sun. The sun is always there. Clouds, rain, storm, haze, whatever -- they come and go.  The sun is always there. Don't get attached to the clouds, the rain, the storm, the haze. They are temporary.&nbsp;  They don't last long.  They come and go. Detach yourself from these temporary inconveniences.  Free yourself of baggage, ghosts past, worries, fears, superstitions, prejudices, anger, jealousy. Free yourself. It's the sun that's permanent!

      After a gap of two days, I thought this morning, hey, its' time to write my blog and etch into the history books what has happend to me...   Friday Morning.....  Woke up at 6 am, ran to the gym literally, wished everyone the best, gave my farewells to them and quite literally ran thro my workout.&nbsp; Reached home at 8, had a quick bath and got into my saree.&nbsp; Gosh, had it been ages or what since I wore one of these!&nbsp; Had taken a vow that I would not wear one of these, unless and until I dropped some weight...hehe...dropped a few kgs, so I guess this will count...;)&nbsp; Reached office at 9;10am, only to be hounded by one question, "why saree?" and one comment, "you look really very nice in one!" After a while, I think I kindof started to hear only this and it kept ringing in my head for hours together !&nbsp; Man, utter pain, I dont think I should ever wear a saree again to office.&nbsp; If for a simple purple saree people say this, wonder what they would say if I were to wear my black and red saree...hmm...food for thought I guess..hahaha!   Friday afternoon ....  This is where the entire trip began, took permission from office and began my trip down south.&nbsp; This was a trip with a difference since this time the reason was not me to drive down to my dad's native place, but my&nbsp;cousins and my dad.&nbsp; First stop was at Pondy, man, the hotels are getting reallly sad with their food or else my tongue has gone for a complete toss that I do not understand the taste of food any longer!&nbsp; Whichever the case, it was a rush and dash&nbsp; stop there.&nbsp; Once that completed, the drive down to Mayavaram began.&nbsp; We had promised one&nbsp; of the relatives that we would come down for a function at the temple, so this stopover.&nbsp; We reached Mayavaram at 7 that night, was all smoky instead the temple as the yagna had been in process for over 5 hours.&nbsp; Stopover here was a lot longer than me anticipated, from a planned 30 minutes stop it became a 1.5 hours stopover.&nbsp; My little cousins had come along from the native to join us here, so though the stop over was really long, I didnt really feel the pain of the time which elapsed.&nbsp; The dharshan at the temple was really good, though the smoke sure began to irritate my nose!&nbsp;   Then at 8:45pm, began the drive to my dad' native.&nbsp; Courtesy of the bridges being redone, a 40 minutes drive became a 1.5 hours drive, and with the complete lack of lighting on those roads, it was a complete nightmare.&nbsp; Slowly around 10:30 reached my dad's native.&nbsp; As I pulled myself out of the car,legs were totally cramped up coz of the long drive, I noticed that I had forgotten to bring my drawing notepad.&nbsp; Dinner was ready so after a quick wash it was a run to the dinner table.&nbsp; Dinner was followed by the first movie of the weekend.&nbsp; We started the movie at 11:30pm, a tamil movie called "aetheree" and that went on till 1:30am.&nbsp; Good hilarious movie, simply didnt make too much of sense though...hahaha..but then, whats new to tamil movies, they never had story lines or any sense of connection. Once the movie was over, began the chatting session with my uncle, and that went on for over an hour, finally hit the sack at 3am.   Saturday....   Courtesy of the long night, I had to literally pull myself out of bed, as we had to visit a temple at 9.&nbsp; Once the usual cumbersome daily routine was over, the time to jump into a saree came again.&nbsp; I was kindof wondering which saree to wear, a red one or the deep blue.&nbsp; Both were quite sentimental sarees for me, red one had worn it to my grandpa's 80th birthday and the blue one was the one I wore to his sis's wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not able to decide coz both look really nice on me, so I asked my little cousin to pick a saree.&nbsp; He picked the red one, so it was the blue on for Sunday, for the drive back.&nbsp; I hurried into the red saree, almost tripped trying to fix it, was quite a hilarious moment on the road..hahaha.&nbsp; Today was electricity maintainene day, so no electricity from 9 am to 4pm.&nbsp; Man, wearing a saree and no current around is probably the worst thing which can ever happen!&nbsp; Anyway, got thro with that, visited the temples with my little cousins, two temples, Mudikondan and Sirupuliyur.&nbsp; Quite beautiful and quaint temples, of Lord Rama.&nbsp; Then it was lunch time, got back into town, had lunch at 2pm, and hit the sack for a while, actually for 15 minutes, only to be woken up by my little cousin stomping on my stomach.&nbsp;   Then began his entertainment time, I had to teach him, his sister and their friends origami.&nbsp; For the next 3 hours, all I did was teaching a bunch of kids who age ranged from 14 to 3, how to make water bombs, dragons, penguins, frogs, fish, butterflies and baskets.&nbsp; Man, it sure is one major pain to teach kids...god only knows how my mom does it so well!!!&nbsp; I guess Sagitarrians tend to be useless with kids...and should just leave that task to Cancerians!  At 6pm, my aunt and I decided to go shopping, but before we could actually leave the house, my dad decided that he wanted to go to another temple, so all plans got postponed.&nbsp; This temple we had to go was on the mayavaram road, and is a temple closely associated with our family.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the temple, my great grandpa used to do his pooja's at from the age of 5 and more than anything this is the temple at which my dad's star birthday was celebrate while my great grandpa was alive.&nbsp; The main deity in this temple is called Bhaktavatsala Perumal and looks so handsome.&nbsp; Even in the darkness, yep, no current yet again, his features were so beautifully highlighted that one could only but get lost his amazing eyes.  We finshed up with this temple by 8pm and just as I began to relax out my cousin arrived back from her tution class and she was completely determined&nbsp;to drag me out.&nbsp; I then quickly changed into something light and easy and went hunting for the driver.&nbsp; This was one useless exercise as the driver jsut did a major disappearing act.&nbsp; After 20 minutes of fruitless effort, I decided okay, just to adapt to the walk mode.&nbsp; At about 9pm, my cousin and my aunt began our walk to the shopping area.&nbsp; Narrow lanes, a zillion scooters, gawking bystanders, grrr...totally differnt experience.&nbsp; Reached the shopping center at 9:30pm only to be greeted by my uncle, who drags me across the counters to select some clothes for my parents and me.&nbsp; So much for my shopping!&nbsp; This exercise lasted for 50 odd minutes, not becoz there was so much of choice, but becoz there was so little!!!&nbsp; Was terribly&nbsp;nauseous at this point and needed something to drink atleast. We then headed to a bakery around the corner, was expecting&nbsp; a dingy hole, only to be presented with a shop with all the appearences of a Hot breads in a sleepy town of Tiruvarur! Had a drink here and settled my stomach&nbsp;a little, as my cousins tried their hands at a pizza.&nbsp; What a pizza they had,thepizza minus tomato, onion and capsicum...lol...yep, jus the base..hahaha!  By the time I reached home it was nearly 11pm, and that then the next movie began, Gilli.&nbsp; Electricity cuts,fluctuations, etc, did not deter me from checking this movie out and this ran on till 1:30.&nbsp; At the stroke of 12am, I wished my dad and was kindof a special occasion, coz this had never happend before.&nbsp; Never have I ever had the chance to wish him at the stroke of 12 on this birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the move was over, my uncle, aunt and I had a round of cards, and this game went on till 3:30am.&nbsp; Thats when sleep and tiredness began to over take me.&nbsp; Hit the sack at about 4am and was woken up at 6:30am the next day!&nbsp; So much for getting some sleep!  Sunday...  This was one of the most exciting days in this trip.&nbsp; After nearly 35 years, my dad's birthday was celebrated in his hometown.&nbsp; My, was he happy on what!&nbsp; We had arranged for a complete pooja at our temple and this was done with complete dedication.&nbsp; The pooja took some time and most of our plans were getting a touch disturbed due to the delay.&nbsp; Had our lunch at 10am, and then began our trip to my favourite temples with my uncles' family.  Another first which happend on this trip, visit to natchiyar koil on lord garuda' star birthday, yep, my dad and the lord share the same bday.&nbsp; To our surprise there was a major yagna happening there and it was quite a overwhelming time which we had here.&nbsp; The entire pooja took over 1.5 hours and by the time we were done here, it was almost 12:50pm.&nbsp; I was quite nervous that I would misss the next temple, Uppiliappan as it&nbsp; is one of the temples with which I have a very deep connection.&nbsp; We stepped into the temple at 1:05 and we greeted by the information that, since it was a sunday, the temple is kept open till 1:15pm.&nbsp; We made one dash to the main temple to be greeted by the priest who seems to have memorized my face courtesy of our 6 trips in the last 2 months.&nbsp;   Had an amazing dharshan here, upclose and personal, as they allowed my family to go right upto the main temple gate before the God.&nbsp; Suddenly, out of the blue, the priest came in front of me, and took some water&nbsp;and sprayed it onto me, and said, I understand what u've been thro', dont worry there's lots to go in life still.&nbsp; I dont know where than came up from , coz all he knows of me is a devotee who is a relative of one of the trustees in this temple.&nbsp; He then took out a garland from the deity and handed it to my mom saying, put this around her neck and ask her to go around the temple, the time has come!&nbsp; I was quite taken aback over this, coz I had no idea about whats going on, and neither did my parents.&nbsp;   We then tried to visit another temple, but found this place closed.&nbsp; Then my uncle and his family turned around and headed back home, while we headed back to Chennai.&nbsp; We had one more temple to visit on the way, one seriously long pending one.&nbsp; This was our visit to Srimushnam.&nbsp; One seriously amazing temple with regards to sculptures.&nbsp; This temple infact is supposed to have been a dance heritage and also is one of the 7-8 temples in the 108 divya deshams for which ppl believe that the deity appeared on its knows and no one has any idea of its history.  We finished up with this temple at 5:30pm and began the final lap of our journey.&nbsp; Gosh, one set of terrible roads, a drive which should have taken 20 minutes to get to a particular town, took over 90 minutes.&nbsp; The roads were a serious case of Rest in Pieces!!!&nbsp; From that junction, the journey to Chennai was quite taxing, heavy traffic, blarring lights, I just couldnt take it and fell asleep for 2 hours.&nbsp; All thro those 2 hours, all I could think was what the priest said...why, how ?&nbsp; As we reached Chennai, think about&nbsp;5 minutes or so to the toll gate, I then said to myself, dont ask questions, just take this at face value and accept stuff!&nbsp; As I took that decision and we crossed the toll gate, it began pouring heavily.&nbsp; We hardly had any visibility, road a quite slippery too! Slowly and steadily for the next 40 minutes, we drove into Chennai, at 11pm.  Was dead tired and jsut wanted to hit the sack, could feel the pain in my bones and my stomach was jsut about set to do a strike!&nbsp; Quickly heading into the house, gobbled up something to eat...and just hit the sack at 11:45pm.&nbsp;   This was what caught my imagination in the entire trip....Actually, after&nbsp;I completed two rounds of the temple, I went over and asked the priest what this was all about, since I was far too curious.&nbsp; All he said was, "The time has come for you to make peace, believe in yourself and trust the future.&nbsp; Dont worry about the past, it will stay as memories for you always.&nbsp; There will be a time when all with make peace with each other, dont worry, have no fear over this!"  I dont know what made him say so, why he said so, etc, all I do know is that, Lord Uppiliappan is giving my life some direction now, and if it's his direction, so be it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the questions to which I wanted answers have been put at rest, I dont want to know anything more.&nbsp; Its' time for me to put my future in perspective and dream for my future now onwards!&nbsp;   Keeping this in mind, this morning I woke up at 6:30 am and prepared a list of things/ activities which I need to accomplish in the near future, max 6 months and began planning towards achieving them!   A few&nbsp;lessons I have learnt in this trip.....  1.&nbsp; Memories can never be washed/ locked away, its' always better to cherish them and smile over them, than treat it with disgust as a part of one's past. 2.&nbsp; You can try to change destiny, no harm in it, but destiny will always find its own way of bringing you back to the original path. 3.&nbsp; One needs to take responsibility of their own life, believe that life has a lot to offer them and not get bobbed down over the fact that someone else has something, or someone else is getting more out of life, or that you have lost something in a relationship which the other has not! 4.&nbsp; Our life is not a profit and loss story, its a cash flow statement, the profit as well as the loss, finds its own way of being ploughed in as an investment or getting marked in our lives as a Debt which needs to be adjusted somewhere else. 5.&nbsp; The human mind is a beautiful piece of architecture and mechanic, when you want to forget stuff it will see to that you remember and when you want to remember it will see to that you forget.&nbsp; You cant change it's nature, coz thats what we are made of!&nbsp; We are humans, and this is human nature.&nbsp; Blocking things/ memories/ running away, etc will never work, face the&nbsp; issue head on, thats when your mind and soul will be able to work in sync and allow you to find peace!  Life is a sine curve, sometimes your seated on the crest, sometimes on the trough!&nbsp;Life forces you to go thro' this sine curve only to test your strength in yourself & others!

      This was a beautiful poem which was sent to me by a friend of mine....wanted to have it posted on friday itself, coz it reflected my mindset....  Kept myself educated and learned to train my mind...  So that one day my greatness would shine...  Too many people underestimated my ability and intellect...  That was no problem for me because I conquered every obstacle met...   Now faced with hardships unbearable to face...  Don't know how to rise again, so I just sat down and prayed... &nbsp;I knew that the day would come when I would surely fail... &nbsp;Never knew that I would sink this low and feel so frail...  After surviving all the years of hurt and pain...  My strength and determination would prevail through the rain...  Still difficult to climb that hill...  But my will is too great to stay still...   When all the dust settles and all the smoke clears...  I will emerge back on top higher than I have been inthe past years... For I have faith in myself and that's all one needs... To live in this world where it's difficult to succeed...   So when you feel like there's no hope and want to give up...  Fight with your heart, mind, and soul and I guarantee You will reach the top...

      I think it's a disease for those single people to be all along over the weekends. This is quite an ironic situation with me, because technically I really have my hands full with work or some other activity, but my heart simply is not able to give a 100% to it yet.  No yoga classes for the weekend, so had to practise it at home.  This is one good thing which is happening in my life, brings a certain calmness to my life esp early in the morning.  After a really long time, think a good number of years, I woke up at 9:30am...but then courtesy of waking up so late, I have this headache which is totally irritating...hmm, this is the reason why its' said early to bed and rise & shine!   Dont know whether its early to bed or late to bed which really makes a difference, just feel that if I take more than the quota of 6-7 hours of sleep, I feel miserablly off!  My life appears to have become quite ironical.  There used to be a time when people used to pull my leg for going to sleep at 10pm, haha, and oflate my earliest nap time is infact 11:30/12....so much for being branded as an early bird.  So far the saturday has been a touch boring, just watched a hindi movie, Chalte Chalte, will have the movie review up in my movie blog soon.  Need to set up links to my other blogs from this one too, hmm, maybe a change in the look and feel...hmm.... wouldn't it be nice if one could change life's look and feel?

      Well, finally after a gruelling 7 month period,after 7 months of seriously painful period of patience testing, carrot and stick treatment and begging and pleading sessions, one of my recruiters put in her papers today!   Man, am I a relieved soul or what!!! I have been literally begging the top management to relieve me from this pain for over 4 months, and its' finally happend!  I have had really my hearts content of misery with this recruiter, starting from mails, to arrogance, technical nonsense and even outright jumps in Authority!  On side there is happiness that I have been relieved from this pain and misery, and on the other side, there is unhappiness that it had to come down to this.   Now I will have to wait and watch as how she reacts to the entire situation, am quite sure that she is going to try and gather as much sympathy from everyone before she leaves and leave this place as a god's gift to resourcing!  God only knows if I am going to receive hate mail now...have had one round of it already, am I going to get another round!  Well,this is what I am going to do now...am going to pray that there is a smooth transistion and things pick up for my team!

      Quite a strange thing to write about,but then, this is a reality dose for myself....After a lot of introspection this morning, and all thro' last evening, I did a lot of thinking and this is what I have come up with....  What makes Harini Smile... 1.  A warm hug from someone who I believe is a good friend and understands me! 2.  Sentimental mail about life, maybe a touch ironic, but yet realistic! 3.  A Smile on someone else's face because of what I did for them. 4.  A joke which has no hard feelings, yet light hearted enough to make me feel the warmth of the joke! 5. A pleasant surprise...!  So all those out there trying to bring a smile to my face, well, this is the way to go!

      Do it ANYWAY………Would you actually do it anyway????  People are unreasonable, illogical and self – centered. Love them ANYWAY.  If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good ANYWAY.  If you are successful, you will win false friends and the enemies. Succeed ANYWAY.  Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank ANYWAY.  The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Be good ANYWAY.  The biggest people with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest people with the smallest minds. Think big ANYWAY.  People favour underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for some under dogs ANYWAY.  What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build ANYWAY.  Give the world the best you have and you’ll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you’ve got...ANYWAY.

      One thing which is a serious pain for a woman of 25yrs, in an indian society is to have people asking her when she is getting married, or for her to see all her friends around her getting married and settling down.  It's not as though that hurts her, but the way in which people then start to ask questions, and one suddenly begins to wonder if there is something wrong with themselves!  Painful a thought, but thats an insight into my life at the moment!  This morning, got a call from my schoolmate from Dubai, she's getting married this month, and wanted some help with regards to her makeup and jewellery etc.  I kindof was modest and told her that I exactly aint the right person to ask, coz I've never been thro' the routine to give expert opinions....odd, but thats the truth..as much as I am a good mix and matcher wth regards to stuff, when it comes to marriages, jewellery, makeup and sarees...hmm....dont think I'm up there still.  Nevertheless she insisted, and I said okay, and began to give her some pointers.  But then, since one cant exactly give a makeup routine or jewellery combination without knowing the sarees to be worn, I had to listen with great intent on the saree combinations too.  This was probably the worst thing which I needed to hear about!  I had to listen to saree combinations, for which occasion, who purchased them, etc.  Man, this was utterly painful, and completely ironic....I should have been in this position now, choosing stuff for myself...haha...and what do I get to do, I have the opportunity to instead do it for my friend and her to be sis in law.   Life can be ironic, but this is probably the worst thing I needed at the moment.  I really dont want to think about marriages, but all I have around me, people who remind me of the same, relatives who give proposals and unknown people asking questions to my parents as to why their 25 yr old beautiful daughter aint married!  This pain is something a little too unimaginable for me right now, I know what my parents are going thro'..but why cant people understand what I am going thro' before they keep jumping the gun, make statements & comments and open up my excessively bruised wounds!  This brings me to the question, which I have really been asking myself, Why is marriage such an important aspect for others with regards to me, but of absolute and complete hatred for me???

      This is one song which has had a very powerful effect on my life for a longtime, actually ever since I heard it the first time in 1993!  Walk away if you want to. It’s ok, if you need to. Well, you can run, but you can never hide From the shadow that’s creepin’ up beside you.  And, there’s a magic runnin’ through your soul, But you can’t have it all. (whatever you do) Well, I’ll be two steps behind you (wherever you go) And I’ll be there to remind you That it only takes a minute of your precious time To turn around and I’ll be two steps behind.  Yeah, yeah. Take the time to think about it. Just walk the line, you know you just can’t fight it And take a look around, you’ll see what you can’t find, Like the fire that’s burnin’ up inside me.  Yeah, yeah. Oh. Yeah, baby. Two steps behind Oh, sugar, Two steps behind!

      I probably had the worst start to my day after ages, this morning.  Got a call at 4am from my aunt, that one of my distant grandfathers' had passed away.  This grandfather was one of those cool grandparents I had, really cool guy, smart cookie and amazing in vedic maths.  He had been suffering with Spinal Cancer for over 1 year and really everyone knew his days were numbered.  Guess I just didnt want it to happen so fast!  Anyway, could hardly sleep after that.   Began my day with an hour of SS Music.  Was quite surprised, coz these guys too play some good music in the mornings.  Heard this song from Def leppord, been an age....kindof brought me to tears...probably my next post would have to be this song...."two steps behind"...one really moving song..and then heard songs from Micheal Bolton, 'when a man loves a woman", Rod stewart, Bryan adams, Sting, " All for love", From the OST of Alladin, "whole new world", George Micheal " jesus to a child" & finally Duran Duran" ordinary World".  Had to have some of the new medicines this morning, and man, are the terrible medicines or what, I almost feel as though I have morning sickness!!! Yuck..totally disgusting...!  This is the heights of non sense in my life, my eyes are burning like crazy because of the lack of sleep, my stomach is behaving like a rollacoaster, and I feel like I'm living in the theory of constraints!

      Last evening, was quite strange to say the least. I was supposed to visit the hospital for a checkup, but was informed that the concerned doctor was coming in late, so it would be postponed.  But then, to my shock, the doctor called my grandpa and informed him that he had sent some tablets for me to consume for a month,and that he would do the evaluation based on the results, after a month.  This seriously ticked me off, coz no one is telling me really where the problem is, and instead just making me pump in more and more tablets.  Now the numbers are upto 9 tablets a day!  I hate tablets, its quite a painful thing to swallow so many of them!  Got a call at 6:30pm, from an old friend of mine, Vinay now working at Mphasis BFL, HR guy, sweet fellow.  Had completely lost touch with him for over 2.5 years, and was pleasantly surprised by his call.  He had got my numbers from a common friend of ours, working at Wipro, was quite surprised that that guy actually had my numbers..hahaha...Spoke to him for about 15-20 minutes, about work, relationships,singlehood, parties, studies, was quite nice.  Then suddenly towards the end of the conversation, he was, "Harini, there is a friend of my boss who wants to talk to you, have given him your numbers, and probably he will be catching up with you at 7pm, he's a really nice guy, so dont rip him up!"  I was quite confused over what he said, and asked him, "hey, dude what are u upto? "And his reply, "your single and available right?"  I was like, "huh? what do u mean by that", and all he said was," be patient...talk to you tomorrow...adios !"  The next 10 minutes waiting for this guys' called made me a complete nervous wreck, was left wonder what the hell was going on.  Then, at the sharp stroke of 7pm, he gave me a call, interesting deep voice,must say.  This chat happend over 3 breaks really, 7 to 8:15, 8:30 to 9:10, and then 9:20 to 10:10pm.   The first phase of the chat was a very general one, where he gave me an insight into work he does, hes' a HR person too, but refused to tell me where he worked.  Just said, will tell you about that later.  I was like,hmm...okay fine.  Then had a chat about my work, bosses or shall I say the lack them completely, work related problems in HR, etc.  The second phase was mainly on a person level, about my hobbies, his love for expensive suits, and then  the movie  HUM TUM, had a 15 minutes discussion about that movie, was quite interesting...then had this chat about European markets, the lifestyle, did a comparision to the indian markets, was quite an intellectual discussion for a change!  Quite a funny thing in this was that he was trying to sell Blore as a great city to me, which was where he was, the bazaars, the best of the hangouts, cosmopolitian life, etc.  The third phase was where things suddenly change, he began to ask me questions about my sensitive areas, my relationships, belief in relationships, relations at work, my weaknesses, etc.  This is where I suddenly became acutely aware that the discussion was heading in a very different direction.  So, up went my antennas' and began to carefully answer each of the questions from there on.   It was kindof getting late too, and at about 10am, I kindof drew the confidence from god only knows where, and asked him, so why you interviewing me....? He then replied, " hmm, smart girl, thought I'd be able to get most of the information out of you and then drop the bomb.  Was a pleasure having a nice intellectual discussion with someone after ages, and with someone as talented as you, was especially a lot of fun."  I then was quite shocked, and said, " okay, so which firm do you work at?"  And then came the big one, " Oh, me, I work for IBM at Blore.  We just happen to be hunting for a HR person and Vinay kindof gave you a very strong recommendation. Was quite curious to know why he was strongly recommending you, so decided hey, lets give you a call and check you out.  Was kindof in a good mood, so decided to first get to know you and then try to gather inputs on you. "  I was absolutely taken aback, coz I didnt know whether to be angry for being put on a wild goose chase like this, or give vinay a call and scream my guts at him...or thank this guy for the opportunity!  Was an absolutely hilarious situation to be in!  Best part of the entire deal was that, I never mentioned to anyone that I was thinking of a change, coz I really aint at this moment, too many commitments at home to comply with...god only know where such things come and fall on my lap!  Anyway, finally I thanked him for a seriously interesting and different interview...hahaha..man, will never forget this.  I then gave vinay a call, spoke to him for about 20 minutes, had a good laugh over stuff...and asked then headed to bed with memories of a seriously different day in my life flying across my mind!

Need to run thro' the usual bunch of tests...dont even like the thought that I need to give blood....hate the sight of it..and the sight of needles, man, thats enough to freak me out completely!!!  Just hope this entire thing just blows over really fast, and I am perfectly back to normal health soon...dont want to look like a zombie on the move!

      Looks like I have been cursed with regards to my weekends, something or another goes wrong with me here!  My saturday was quite disturbing to say the least.  Actually, most of this started off on Friday evening, when I kindof went into this lull and complete depression.  The birthday party brought back a whole lot of memories for me and that absolutely ripped thro' my soul, I could feel this agonizing pain run thro' my heart.  Friday evening, I needed a change desperately after the gloomy time I had at office, and headed to the beach for a walk.   Man, one weird thing, but somehow usually the beach tends to calm my nerves down and it did a good job, but the effects were only temporary.  I walked at the beach, one solid brisk walk for 30 minutes and then picked up my aunt and headed home.  Rest of the day was most uninteresting to say the least!  Saturday start was a touch dull and boring, but towards the afternoon the spice began.  No idea really what happend to me, all I do know ws that I was hit by a hurricane.  All the medicines which I had been consuming, with god only knows what else began to takes its toll on me.  It all started off with a headache, nagging one.  I thought okay, must be one of those pshyco things, picked up a few DVDs and headed back home.  Watched this movie called HUM TUM, hindi movie, which if literally translated means, We U...!  The movie was one really good one, and personally enjoyed it, due to two reasons, It gave me some relief from my thinking mode and two, It re instilled by faith that our life is a long one, one never knows when and where their paths with cross and with whom, the uncertainity is really what makes life interesting and not driven by pain.  As I was completing up with this movie,  my little cousin called me and informed me that a group of us were heading to Spidey 2 and tickets had been purchased for me too.  So it was spidey time, the movie was pretty well made, good and worthy sequel.  But then towards the end of the movie, my headache got really bad and from absolutely no where this feeling of naseua took over me.  I headed back home at 7pm, and hit the sack.  Think I slept for 15 mnutes, and the nxt thing I knew was tht I was feeling so absolutely queezy in life & was running between the loo and my bedroom, poppin medicines.  This was a horrible feeling for me, and the pain of being stuck in such a situation was miserable to say the least.  Then as though my probs were not bad enough, my body decided to play a nasty game with me, and I developed severe muscle cramps at about 9pm.     With no medicine having any effect on me, courtesy of throwing up stuff over and over, I headed to my grandpa, to seek some emotional strength.  The pain simply began to take over my senses completely and there was hardly a minute I could stay without thinking of my soulmate, he was always this person who wanted to be with me when I was sick and in pain...haha, when I needed him the most, he just couldnt be there for me.  So ironic....after all that has happend in my life off late, all the nasty stuff said, all the pain caused for people around, all the sadness which still fills my heart, and all the so called anger which I am to have towards him, I still couldnt stop thinking about him thro' every second of those 7 hours of pain!  7 hours of pain which ripped thro' me completely, so bad that the doctors at home are quite baffled with my body.    Anyway, this pain continued on and on, medicines were having no effect at all me.  Even my uncle who is a doctor came in at 3:30am in the morning to give me relief, but all went in vain. Finally with no choice left at all, I was given an injection, and that knocked me out at 4:30am.  All the pain seriously got to me and I couldnt even hold myself.  Couldnt tell my parents even that I had a blackout the previous day, coz then they would get seriously worried.   Should be heading to the hospital this evening to do a complete checkup, since I totally scared everyone out of their skins today.  God...why the hell am I being put thro this emotional and physical torture....its killing me....I've stopped asking questions, so why stil this emotional and physical turmoil for me!!!

      For a long time, while watching serials like B&B, Santa Barabara, Dynasty, Young and restless,Neighbours, etc, I used to wonder when the reference used to be made about your "First true love"!  Everytime, it used to be picturized as this feeling which was unmatchable, and something which could never die from your life!  I used to wonder, hey, its' just a person who comes into your life and then moves away, and you then move to the next person...so whats the big fuss all about?   But then, a few days ago, I began to take a different angle to this ideology and decided to do a little research on why it is said that " true love is the purest form of love, and why one cant ever get over it for life! "  First and foremost, when does a person fall in love the first time?  Well, one can hardly say, coz true love is quite different from a crush or an infactuation, it's this feeling of weightlessness which overtakes a person and makes them feel that the entire world in which they exist is too perfect, when in reality, they know quite well that it's far from being called perfect!  When one falls in love for the first time, the emotions which conquer the heart and mind are quite unimaginable really, everything feels amazing, there is a complete halo aroud the person and things feel absolutely perfectly warm and  romantic!  When does this happen to people, well, can happen at the age of 10, 50 or even 80...one never knows when they'll find that first person for whom they will have such overwhelming feelings for....it just happens one fine day!  Everyone remembers their first love. Few experiences will ever be as intense and overwhelming as your first crush.When teenagers develop a sense of extraordinary closeness with another person, the experience has echoes of the close contact between mother and child in infancy. Falling in love as a teenager is more intense than the experience in adulthood. But these early relationships usually burn out quickly!   Falling in love for the first time is like taking your first go at cocane!  As funny as it sounds, the effects are very much the same, a heady mix of emotional and physical passion with your partner.  So how does one know that they are going thro' the process of falling in love for the first time?  Researchers have identified three phases of love. The initial physical response is 'lust'. The falling in love is called 'attraction'. The emotional commitment, required to make relationships last in the long term, is known as 'attachment'.  The first cuddle, the first kiss, first hug, first date and many firsts will always linger in your mind with all other special memories of your life!   So why is it so tough for people to get over something as your first love? Isnt it just an experience like another?  Its' not as though we dont fall in love and out of it again?   Well...the answer is quite simple, like all special things, its the first experience, the first of the addictions in your life...the first step towards maturing...the first step towards adulthood!  Can one ever forget their first love?  No way, its a part of your history, your life on this planet!  For any amount of pain which might have gone with this experience, its an experience worth cherishing for a life time...the first time you fall head over heals for a person and that person reciprocates the same feelings towards you!  Love is an addiction, you cant kick this habit without finding another addiction to get addicted to!

      Now this one topic which has always got my attention, since I am just the type of person who is quite uncomfortable with the thought of making a commitment to someone whom I dont know well enough. This was a bit of a dormant topic, till yesterday, when I was watching this news cut on a news channel about Live relationships, and the gaining popularity of this concept among Indians.  I personally have always liked this concept essentially for the following reasons: 1.  Good check of compatibility under the same roof 2.  Easy transition to a commitment of marriage 3.  Better learning experience 4.  More quality time gets to be spent with your partner In all:  It gives you a chance to test out the waters before taking the Big plunge.  But then, are there negatives to this situation ??? Well, I can only think of the following: 1.  Things are taken for granted 2.  The relationship starts to be more driven by Sex, than that of an emotional commitment. 3.  People get into the mode where they take things for granted and forget to spend time with each other!  Funny but dont these negatives really sound more like the downsides of marriage? Hahaha...!  So whats the difference really! Well, as far as I'm concerned, Live In relationships is a commitment of a non legalised sense, essentially a marriage of two souls which aint on paper!  Well..some people can also see this in terms of Co habitation....kindof like a due diligence process which needs to be completed before the final jump!   Just curious but in this form of relationships...is the independent self maintained at all???

      Was reading this interesting article online, and kindly did a little bit of analysis on where I could have gone wrong in this..and try to rectify next time around...  How prevalent is office romance? I did an unscientific survey among my colleagues and discovered not only had they had at least one office romance, some of them met their spouses at work. Other experts report that dating colleagues is indeed on the increase. And it’s no surprise. Employees spend a lot of time at work and many of them have no intention of spending their careers with one employer, so the potential of negative career impact has been blunted. The influx of younger workers has brought a more casual and accepting attitude, as well. And meeting a soul mate at work is more likely than at a singles bar or at an Internet site, since people already share common goals and interests.  Does that mean it’s accepted and a good idea?Not quite. While most CEOs I know admit that office romance, like office gossip, is impossible to legislate against, it doesn’t mean they have to like it. For example, they worry about sexual harassment lawsuits - by a jilted lover, or by someone else, who feels one of the parties is getting favored treatment. They also feel that productivity can be negatively affected. And what if one of them is transferred or fired? Sometimes it means both leave.  What are some of the negative ramifications of an office romance?Like it or not, you are now seen as a couple, rather than as an independent person. It can limit your job promotions and lateral movement, since companies don’t want a couple working together or reporting to one another. Other people are on guard and filter what they tell either member of the duo, anticipating that it will be cocktail conversation that evening. Colleagues assume the pair has lost their objectivity regarding the productivity and results of the other. If the relationship goes sour, and odds are it will, a nasty break up can wreak havoc on an office. The drama can be worse than reality TV.  Can’t a relationship be discrete and professional? It’s possible but it takes mature people who have clearly articulated the rules of engagement. Such as: Never date a married colleague.    Never date someone who reports to you, or who could have an impact on your work.   Don’t use the company email to send love notes or engage in excessive online chatting while at work. You don’t want to give the impression you are distracted (and email can be monitored).    Don’t drive to or from work together.   Don’t lunch at work or arrange to meet for breaks.   Refrain from “walk bys” (where one of you walks by the others desk just to chat or “drop something off”).  Arrive at company events separately and network separately. It’s important to maintain your individual identity with your colleagues.    Avoid traveling on business together. It looks unseemly and makes people wonder if you’re focused on the task or dating/vacationing on the company checkbook.    Don’t discuss your relationship with people at work. It will be telegraphed on the gossip hotline. Believe me, they will find out soon enough without you helping them.    Have a heart-to-heart discussion and get agreement about how you will handle a lovers’ quarrel or a break up. It’s not a romantic topic but it’s important to set some professional boundaries if you split.  There are two aspects to your success: your performance and how you’re perceived. Ideally, your private life should be private but it rarely is - especially if you date someone at work.

      All these days I have been wondering about my relationships, how I went about each of them and what went wrong in each of them.  But till date, I never actually thought about what I learnt from each of them.  Thats pretty, coz as a HR person I should have actually found a reason behind the attraction towards each case...  Today while sitting at work, I was pondering over my nightmares which I have been getting for over 2 weeks on and off, and I figured, there is obviously a lack of completion in each case.  But what is it that was missing..then I realised, a lesson from them!  I think I can talk about two major learnings I have had, from all the relationships I have been involved in to date...  1.  Ethics : Every relationship is governed by certain ethics and values which bind us to our daily lives.  We cannot assume we are above or below those standards, never try to break away from those ethical standards, it will only conjure up painful moments where one will stand caught in between Morals, ethics & values on one hand vs. emotional tie ups/ commitmetns!  2.  Silence : Sometimes silence has this amazing power which can heal a lot of problems. Words said in haste, can only but wreck even small chances of fixing a pace maker to the heart of the relationship!  My sessions at yoga have made me realise this to a very good extent!  To tell you the truth, actually had a chat with a close friend of mine, who is now rocking the products world in Hyd.  He kindof made me think about a few things in my relationships, why I have been confused, why I am trying to drive at peace and not being able to reach my destination!

      This was an article which I had read a few weeks ago....thought it kindof makes sense to me....actually lot more sense to me now...  "A person is limited only by the thoughts that he chooses."  You are not limited to the life you now live. It has been accepted by you as the best you can do at this moment. Any time you're ready to go beyond the limitations currently in your life, you're capable of doing that by choosing different thoughts.  We each earn the income we do today because that is the amount we have limited ourselves to earn. We could easily earn 5, 10, 20 times more if we did not limit ourselves through the thoughts we maintain. Don't believe that's true? Surely you know people who earn much more than you who don't have your education, your skills, or your intelligence. So why do they earn more than you?  I love the story of George Dantzig that Cynthia Kersey wrote about in Unstoppable. As a college student, George studied very hard and always late  into the night. So late that he overslept one morning, arriving 20 minutes late for class. He quickly copied the two math problems on the board, assuming they were the homework assignment. It took him several days to work through the two problems, but finally he had a breakthrough and dropped the homework on the professor's desk the next day. Later, on a Sunday morning, George was awakened at 6 a.m. by his excited professor. Since George was late for class, he hadn't heard the professor announce that the two unsolvable equations on the board were mathematical  mind teasers that even Einstein hadn't been able to answer. But George Dantzig, working without any thoughts of limitation, had solved not one, but two problems that had stumped mathematicians for thousands of  years. Simply put, George solved the problems because he didn't know he couldn't.  Bob Proctor tells us to "keep reminding yourself that you have tremendous reservoirs of potential within you, and therefore you are quite capable of doing anything you set your mind to”. All you must do is figure out how you can do it, not whether or not you can. And once you have made your mind up to do it, it's amazing how your mind  begins to figure out how." And that's worth thinking about.

      Yesterday I had to run thro a series of test, was a major pain, simply hate giving blood and running myself thro' tests.  After 45 minutes of that, I began to feel like a person who is totally sick and hardly has anything left in her system!  Anyway, the purpose of the tests was to give the doctors some direction on whether the medication is having any effect on my system, and they sure did get an answer....absolutely no change in the parameters.....totally depressing!  Looks like my system is getting immune to the medication too...hahaha...well, anyway, the docs now have decided to up the medication strength and check if atleast then I show any improvement.  God only knows whats up with my system, mind and soul aint in sync, that I know, but then, for how long is it going to go on like this???  It's getting too depressing for me to handle!  These medications are supposed to make me better, but somehow show no effects in a positive sense really.  These idiotic medicines are now promoting a weight increase, high levels of nausea, dizziness, grrr, what more can a people who is emotional disturbed want to complete the emotional rollacoaster!!!!

      The day so far as been an interesting composition of unexpected stuff and expected stuff.   Been wondering about some stuff in my professional side, and kindof getting some answers on that quarter now.  Its' kindof like a point where you understand where you are heading to and what you really want in your career.  I think I have finally got some sense of direction on this now,guess I need to now let a few things roll out and then I guess I might be in a better position to access my progress in my plans.  Had a very interesting chat with an old school friend of mine, he had kindof run away from the US after a breakup and come to India recently.  He said this really interesting thing about breakups and healing, in the story oliver twist, after the breakup, an old and wise man said to Jenny, "time will heal you", Later in the story Jenny says, "yes, he said so, but never told me how long it would take!"  Well, as true as it may be to the "T", thats the way love goes!  It's an addiction which can never be snapped out of, unless and until another addition overrides it!

      This weekend probably was interesting in a different sense when compared to my last weekend.  The few things that were really there in common were, the 9 pills, which is now up to 10 plus some weird syrup which tastes like a cross of complan and bricks...the thinking mode for the weekend...and one injection...hahaha!  Well, things kindof got started on saturday when I watched this movie called Chalte Chalte, quite an ironic movie about this guy who seem to do everything wrong with this girl, she marries him, and he continues to let her down.  Whatever he did, he did it wrong and earns her anger and heartbreak.   The biggest joke is that the woman knows that he wont change and yet goes back to him just becoz he begs!  Man, this is the heights of stupidity!  Where is the sense of remorse or atleast a show of reason to change for your partner!  Anyway, movie apart this kindof set my thinking mode off.   I needed from fresh air and my parents were kindof busy, so I decided saturdays I will head to the park close by and do some serious work there....so it was for the next 1 hour, I headed to the park and did some thinking in the walk mode.  For that one hour I just analysed my life, where I stood, what I had lost, what I had gained, what I needed to do, what I needed to shed.  Ofcourse, before I realised it began to get dark and needed to head back home, so had my exercise for my mind and body really...Was supposed to head to the beach in the evening, but due to the arrival of my uncle and aunt, just headed the club.   At the club, my next level of thinking began, and there were just two questions which came to my mind.... 1.  What makes me a woman who can swing to any extremes to make people happy? 2.  What sort of a family situation will make me bring happiness to people around me?  To answer these questions, I took out a piece of paper and began to write a long open letter about these two areas.  The more I thought, the more the thoughts kept flowing.....and what do you know, before I knew it the stress began to go sky high and my legs started to go numb slowly.  Thank god for me, was heading back home by the hospital, so took a shot and then headed home.  Obviously, in this condition no one would allow me to sit and do anything, so was packed to bed at 9 pm...boohooo!  Sunday...hmm...different issue altogther, woke up at 9;30am, and decided I was gonna relax and totally chill off.  Spent some time with my uncle and aunt, initiated work on a few pending orders, and then headed to have an oil bath.  Gosh, never realised to what extent I am a "hot" person..;)  hahaha...well, got the ordeal over with shikakaai....more in my eyes ..hahaha...and some sambarani......hair smells really odd now!!!  Then sat down for lunch at 2pm, boring lunch...hardly felt like eating, so skipped most of the stuff.  Then sat down with my parents and finalized the house plan and gave it to the architect for his expert comments.   Just hope this house comes out well, have done most of the design work in this...and should have one awesome room in the first floor, more like a studio for myself, with french windows and a painting area......and a nice bathtub to doze off hahahaha...with a good walk in wardrobe...hmm..that reminds me ..need to do some big time shopping....hardly been to spencers oflate....or maybe I should head to T Nagar or Pantheon road and pick some hip and low cost stuff up...hmm.....need to ponder over this one!  Seriously need to re stock my wardrobe....its got too boring..too many blues, greens and pinks...need to add some variety....maybe some reds, purples and browns...hmm.....maybe silver.......got this nice salwar from my uncle, a beautiful black with gold work.....looks gorgeous....need to re stitch some areas...too large for me...hahahaa!   Other than this, it  was one boring time with my aunt, hunting brides for my cousin..hahaa...had my grandparents bugging me to check out some guys...but I was like, hey, am the kid of the family, spare me....the queue is jammed in front..;)  Good joke, bu they refused to buy it..hahaha!  One thing is for sure, this weekend was quite an interesting one, very introspective, enriching for my mind and soul and more than anything, gave me a sense of direction for my artistic side!

      This weekend wasnt exactly the most exciting of my life, was the run of the mill activity, for a few diversions really...  Saturday...  Woke up at 6am(heaven knows why I wake up so early even on holidays), did some light exercise and then sat down to my painting work by 7:30 am.  Kindof lost interest mid way and left the painting at about 10am.  This painting was due in feb 04,but I couldnt work on it coz I simply wasnt mentally atuned at that time.  I then sat down and watched Khakee.  This movie was a little too predictable for me, but nevertheless good acting across the board.  Had a very late lunch at 3pm, as I was unable to eat anything, effect of not exactly being able to digest my breakfast, stomach and eusophagus was a complete mess!   Evening was really spent at home, except for a visit to the eye doctor to check my eye sight and see if there are any issues.  Thinking of moving to contact lens in case the power doesnt stabilize and I cant do my LASIK. Courtesy of the medicine put in my eyes, hardly could watch the tv too!  Had a pretty stormy discussion with my dad on marriage.  He was pretty bugged to the max after having that chat with me, and kindof gave me a " you just cant be corrected!" shrug at the end of the discussion!  Well, thats me, the woman who refuses to bite the bullet right now!  Sunday... Parents had to go out for a function, and granny wanted to visit our religious pontiff.  Since there was no one else to go along with her, I had to be her guide.  Had to hunt for a saree at 6am, lousy task esp since most of my mom's sarees are of rare colours!  Finally found some saree, wore it and rushed downstairs, almost tripped over.  Man, it could have been an interesting thought...sliding down the steps in a saree...rofl!Could have been a serious sight..hahaha!Anyway, the visit to the Ahobila Mutt was okay, heavy crowd since it was Independence Day and  a sunday. In all of that crowd the pontif took a few extra momemts..okay, not moments,  lot of extra moments...for me and my granny, got royally ragged by him over issues like what the mutt stood for, about my work and finally the one issue I simply hate talking about...marriage! After 20 minutes of a complete drill, I was short of running out of that place.  Reached home at 11:30am, to be greeted by my parents who were just leaving for the ceremony. I was feeling miserably down, stomach hasnt been doing too well, so decided to skip lunch.  Sat down and watched " Addicted to love"...interesting movie must say, good and hilarious...had a good laugh over it and kindof began to feel a little better. Aunt wanted some lousy matrimonial stuff to be done, finished with that, and was once again left back in a lousy mood.  Had to shift thro' a zillion profiles, for my cousin bro and a cousin sis too!  It was miserable,as I had to go thro' guys profiles and my aunt and others would comment, we could check that for u,grrrr!  Man, I hate this marriage process....so lousy!  Anyway, in the process, also got to see the ad placed by my ex's parents.  Quite an interesting ad, must say, wonder who their target audience is!  Anyway, after a lousy matrimonial hunt session, I had something to eat as I was feeling dizzy.  Was around 4pm, then decided to watch  a movie, so checked out "what a girl wants".  Nice fairy tale, warm cuddly movie must say.  This was the moment where I began to feel my emptiness, so I had to go to the temple to smooten myself out.  I then headed to my favourite temple in town at Luz, drove past the beach....amazing cool wind was blowing across, but the minute I had a look a the crowd, I just turned and headed ot the club.  Club was its usual boring self, had dinner and headed home.  Once I was back home...hmm...had an interestingly noisy discussion with my mom on the favorite topic of the house...yep, marriage...I suddenly have this funny feeling of wanting to run away from home...jsut to avoid talking about this topic!  Man, this heat is getting too much for me to handle....might just a scoot from this place!
