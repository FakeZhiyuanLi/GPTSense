       Cypress / Afoot  by Let's Active  1983/84  Revision after purchase : Let's Active is Mitch Easter's band (producer of Murmur, etc) and was apparently known to everyone from our parent's generation.  But now is the time for the Jangle Rock Revival.  Everything on this album is good--very tight, well assembled, but lacks some of the attacker power of early REM.    From the liner notes : "A huge blast of lightning that summer blew up a lot of the equipment at the Drive-In, so we mixed Cypress at Reflection in Charlotte...We'd walk over to the Krispy Kreme every few mixes, which was another advantage of working there."   urlLink Here's an mp3.

      After being thoroughly disappointed by the new Tortoise album, then having missed the Athens performance by the aforementioned band, I realized that I need some new music, like, bad.  I can't be alone here.  Evan and I can't keep this thing running by our respective lonesomes.  And my posts are just going to be a rundown of the Thrill Jockey lineup.  So Megan, tell your Mom, Evan, tell your town(ies).  I'll put up the first recommendation next week.  Jason

      ok. an album new to me: phoenix "united"  it dates back to the year 2000 and you've probably heard their song "too young," the golden track off of the lost in translation soundtrack.  the rest of the album is pretty amazing.  their story is that one of the members, branco, was in a band called darlin. they split up, some of darlin formed daft punk, branco went in a different direction with phoenix.  there are some definite daft punk influences on one or two tracks, but all in all, the album is a winner.  its been described as :'Undoubtedly the best post-French house, seventies Californian, country-rock concept album of modern love songs you'll ever likely to hear.' mmmm.

      Evan told me about it.  New Juana Molina CD just out.  Go forth and buy.  Update: This album is even sleepier than Segundo, the one that came before.  There's more emphasis on vocal/guitar melodies than on layering and ambient electronic stuff.  Still excellent.  Still super sleepy.  Still recommended.

      Hey Jacob, This is a great idea for a blog, I always appreciate a heads up on good music. Five Eight and The Tom Collins Band were both at Music Midtown this year, ignorant non-Athens folk missed them in their haste to catch great acts like The Offspring and Puddle Of Mud. The new release "Five Eight" is REALLY GOOD. Some people just can't get used to the vocals, but at least his singing isn't generic. I've always liked this band, and some of it's best songs ever are on this release. Proof yet again that Athen's is a veritable breeding ground of great music.

       Three by Archer Prewitt  2004  This album sounds like Matthew Sweet covering the Bee Gees.  Also, the last half is really, really mellow.  To be expected from the guitarist for the Sea and Cake.  This is good background music.  Unfortunately for your life, this album does not have the ability to change test scores or spontaneously cause graduation from college.     urlLink MP3.

      So, I should really be studying for a final that has the potential to ACTUALLY ruin my life.  But as any good person knows, studyin's for chumps, and real good music is the only thing that matters in this sad sad world.  I've purchased no new albums lately, so I haven't a review for you.  I did, however, uncover an amazing resource for some obscure and hard-to-find albums that you've been searching high and low for, or maybe ones that you didn't even know that you wanted.  And what's best about "Other Music" 's reviews is that they are either written in-house or they are pulled from sources other than the ever-popular and musically omniscient (sp?) AllMusicGuide. Other music's Personal description: "  A unifying aesthetic for a cornucopia of seemingly disparate musical genres; an attempt to classify    the unclassifiable by delineating the common threads among these genres."   Check "Other Music" out at:  othermusic.com
