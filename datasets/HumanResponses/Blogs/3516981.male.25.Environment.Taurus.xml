      I'm putting this blog together because of a lack of resources on the internet about pre-commercial thinning or brushing as its called out west. I've been thinning for the last month and am just starting to get experienced enough to make some money. The bugs aren't out too bad yet and I've heard stories about cutting into hornet's nests so we'll see how things go. Below is a little blurb I wrote or  urlLink http://www.replant.ca/board/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=85  concerning the differences between tree planting and thinning.   -------------------------------------------------------------   I can't really speak to comparing planting and brushsaw work but I can vouch for the comment that having a techincal understanding of the saw and how to fix it is important. I work with a guy from Paris France and he couldn't even start the darn thing on our first day but he's still learning and starting to get fast.   In New Brunswick we do pre-commercial thinning which involves cutting everything that's not commercially viable (up to 6" in diameter) and then spacing the rest at 6'. Every vetran I've talked to agrees that the biggest thing to keeping your cutting fast (and making $$$) is being able to sharpen your blade effectively and keep your saw singing. The biggest parts of saw maintenance involve keeping the air filter and spark arrestor clean. Rates around here run about $435/hectare and the blocks are between .5 and 3 hectare each. Lots of guys will travel from province to province around the atlantic region making around $800/week.   Its not really a job to do for the summer because of the big investment needed to get started. Your gear will run around $1500 and you'll beat the living hell our of your truck or you will be paying someone else to ride in theirs. A car will not get you to your block   Anyway... the work's not that hard once you're in shape and you know how to approach your block. If you drop trees in such a way that you never have to walk over them and can do this fast you're laughing. Also, you'll generate a serious hate for maple clumps. I even have a hard time looking at the flag these days. ;-)  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      Blueish-Black  That's the colour I expect my right shin to turn later tonight or maybe tommorow.  The elastic energy that can be contained in a bowed over tree is truely amazing and sometimes shockingly so.  Our new block is an itty-bitty 1.06 Hectare but the cutting in terrible. I'd say the stand is 20 or more years old so everything is huge and tall, a chainsaw might be a more appropriate weapon.  We put a big dent in it today and hope to be done by the end of Monday.  This block is so bad that alot of guys are just taking the next few days off until we move to a new block.  No truck access, shitty cutting, terrible bugs and just decent pay aren't making anyone too keen.  Whatever, I like the work... burn six tanks of gas and I'm out.  Peace. ~Jeff   Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      Well, we got our last strip done this morning at about 10:30am and headed out to the next block.  Everything was going awesome, I knew the area we were going and got in touch with my foreman in record time.  BUT, we got out there and everyone was sitting on tailgates at the mouth of the road.    It turns out this new block is full size 4x4 territory only. We'd arrived just after the latest rescue mission and no-one was interested in walking in the 3km to the strips.  It was agreed that beer in the afternoon and a 6am meeting the next day for thinner ferry service was the only choice.  Man, loosing a half day is like loosing $60 bucks.  I guess its alright thought. Its only 1 in the afternoon and the warblers are now battling with the chickadees at the feeder next to my computer. What could be more entertaining than a bird fight?

      Man, it's not even that hot out yet but work pants and caulk boots are getting pretty uncomfortable. I'm going to be alright though, I think its time to start working in a wife-beater. The bugs are still leaving me alone as long as I'm moving so I don't think being that exposed will be a big problem. What is a big problem right now however is my partner.   For some reason my partner wears the same dark grey SWEATshirt to work everyday. Now, this shouldn't be a problem, except every warm day by about noon he's run out of water and starts drinking mine... now I don't want to sound like an ass but water is my absolute lifeline when working. I can withstand almost any amount of torment while working because I always know that after this tank of gas I can have a nice big cool drink of water.   Well, last week on a particularly huge block we were almost to then end and it was hotter than heck out when I found that my partner had FINISHED my water. I could have killed him.   Today was no different and even though I've told him time and time again that he needs to bring more water with him he hasn't seemed to get the hint. Unfortunately today (after he'd run out of all his gas, another issue) he started drinking my water again. I didn't say anything about it while we were out on the strip because everyone's more irritable when tromping over fallen trees but I let him know without any chance for misunderstanding or interpretation that I wasn't happy about sharing water and that if he ran out tomorrow he could not have any of mine.  It seems really petty but that's just how I feel about it, we'll see tomorrow if he brings a bigger jug....

      There are two things about thinning in New Brunswick that are gartanteed. First trucks get stuck almost every day and two; your co-workers will be an international cross-section exceeded only by the United Nations Council.  Today brought the threat of rain and cool overcast skies.  We got into our strip a bit late because we'd spent about a half hour driving around trying to figure out a back-back way to get onto the powerlines that made the front road of our strip.  Once we got in the old way we ran into the foreman and he let us know that 2 new guys from Quebec would be starting today and we might see them because we're the only 2 franco-anglo's in th woods.  I'm bilingual because of 12 years of public school french immersion and my partner is bilingual because he've from Paris France.  After about one tank of gas I looked up and noticed a guy in a yellow rain jacket comming through the woods towards me.  I figured It must be one of the new Quebec guys so I put down my saw and yelled "Comment ca va?!"  I was responded by a very confused Russian accent that yelled back "you help me?! I am in trouble."  I dropped my saw and helmet and ran right over to him...  I'm always scared about people getting hurt out here because its so difficult to get in and out of when everything's working fine I'd hate the see of have to try to get out with and injury.  This however wasn't the case.  After a few minutes of broken english and gesturing I figured out that he'd gotten his truck stuck comming in.  The week before we were working beside these guys (affectionately known to all as The Russians) and I'd been able to pull them out of the ditch and he figured I could do the same again today.  Now, I wasn't too happy that he'd come back and interrupted me working because in this game as in most time is money but I'm a sucker of a good samaritan so I started walking with him.  For some reason this guy believes that his early '90s stock 4x4 blazer with bald winter tires can go through anything and its bitten him in the ass before.  Its not only that he tries to get down roads he has no business going through but he also tempts fate by always parking way off the road and taking unconventional lines through mud.  I've also never seen him get out an walk a stretch before trying to drive through.  As I mentioned before I'd managed to pull him out on a previous occasion but that time we were both just pulling into the block and he in usual form drove way off the road to park and sunk himself.  I was still up on the hard pack so it was no big deal to put a chain on and give him a tug.  Originally I'd put the chain in my truck with the assumption that I'd be needing it more for draggin myself out than others but was happy that it was working the other way around.  When we got back to the parking spot (where I was parked) he tried to convince me to just hop in my truck and we'd drive down and get him out... right.  The absolute cardinal rule of this kind of driving is to know what you're getting yourself into.  Another good rule is if you're trying to be the "rescue" vehicle it doesn't help anybody to get stuck yourself.    The Russian seemed a little pissed that I wouldn't take my truck but we walked the road into the power lines and eventually to where he was stuck.  Really, the road leading to the power lines was good but were he went wrong was once he got to the power lines he mistook an absolute 4wheeler trail for something passable by his truck.  It was soupy greasy, and about 4 feet deep.  To his  credit, I think, he'd made it WAY farther into the powerline trail than I thought his truck would.  When we came up on his truck he was easily 300m from the nearest hard road and sunk up to the door handles.  It was obvious that this would be the kind of all day rescue mission that would end up costing me a day's work if I got involved to any extent.    I know this well because I'd missed the previous Monday's work because I'd gotten my truck so bad that an F250 couldn't get in all the way to it on the Sunday night that I put it there and eventually had to leave it the night and return the next day with a 3tonne come-along and 30 feet of VERY heavy chain.  Needless to say I'd payed my "stuck" dues for the month.  I got ahold of their cellphone an put in a call to the foreman. He's got a F150 4x4 but the transfer case is broken so he's currently 4x2 an I knew this so I left a lenghty shopping list of gear that would be needed to rescue the Russians and left back on my merry way to finish the work day the way I'd intended, cutting trees in my strip.  I'm just getting home as I write this and at 3:3OPM as I was walking out of the block I was able to witness the "freeing" of the russian's vehicle.  A jack-all was used to drop the blazer out of the ruts it had made itself and they finally got free after 8 hours of sitting.  Most guys make about 150 dollars a day and there were two Russian's travelling in that truck so I'm just guessing that between the two of them they lost $300 all because of impatience and bad judgement calls.   Some guys build rigs for the express purpose of driving these roads.  Just becasue you see tracks going in and coming out of a hole doesn't mean that you're truck will do it.  There's a distinct different between a lifted full size with 38" Mickey Thompsons and a stock 1/4 ton.  Ruts made by one will kill the other.  Something to keep in mind when there's money on the line.  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      Well, its Monday and after the usuall 3 hour screw around trying to find a foreman, turn in a time card and get shown the next block we get there and got some work started by about 10:30am.  Currently we're thinning just before the Nevers Road off the Trans Canada Highway. Getting into the block requires a drop into the ditch then right into a 25 foot hill climb that leaves you wondering whether your truck can handle the break-over point without getting high centered.  We then drive down what's essentially a four-wheeler trail (yay! for driving a 1/4ton!) and stop at a 'Y' in the road.  This is the fun part.  To get the rest of the way in you've got to pack up everything for the day and walk accross a huge beaver dam metropolis where the road once was.  The ever-adventurous newfies with a big 4x4 proved that it could be driven through but also that it's about five feet deep. Too deep for me and my not-so-mighty 2wd. It takes about 20 minutes to walk  into the strip all the while trying not to slip into a deep muddy beaver pond.    The whole thing was made worthwhile though because the guy I work with for some reason hates to wear his rubber caulk boots. So far, everytime that he's shown up with leather boots its either rained or we've had to walk through a swamp.  Today was no different and silently... to myself...  I Laughed My Ass Off!

      Last Friday I finished a 1.10 hectare block that was brutal. It was a grown up clearcut and the 3rd block I'd done in the area. Super thick and it was raining. Worst of all it was full of maple clumps.   A maple clump usually comes up where a maple has previously been cut. The stump gets left and then 3 to 50 stupid little stems grow up in its place. We've got to space our trees at 6 feet but usually if the maple clump is big enough you can just leave 2 stems on either side of the clump somewhere more than 3 feet apart. The way most guys deal with these clumps is to leave them until everything within about 30 feet of the clump has been thinned. This is so the trees won't be as likely to get hung up.   A sharp saw is the best weapon because the maples are so hard to cut through. Since they're all 'clumped-up' you can't really get your saw bladE on a good side of the stem do direct the fall so you just have to hack at them. Also its a good idea to double cut your trees. By cutting them twice, once up around chest high then again as low as you you are less likely to get hung up.  Anyway, at the end of the day on Friday I'd left a maple clump that was 15 feet in diameter and must have had at least 50 stems on it that was surrounded by these huge 10' thorns that I havn't yet identified. It was the very last thing to be cut for the whole day. I was wearing my damn rain pants because it was wet in the moring but buy the afternoon it was 20C and I was sweating my ass off. I cut the whole thing in 10 seconds flat but the clump had grown like a corscrew with every single branch tied up in its neighboor. I had it cut in 10 seconds but then had to take 10 minutes to drag the cut stems down into the friggin thorns.

      Ok, it was a huge day so I'll start at the beginning:  Like most days the 6am drive into the block turned into a full-on redneck 'muddin' fest.  I got in early and ran into a bunch of guys just coming from the last block and didn't know the way into this one.  They all followed me in and then all got stuck in the one bad hole in the road.  2 chocker chains and some "everybody jump in the back of the 2wd" genius and we had them out.  No big deal just now I'm super dirty.  We walked into the back of the strip we'd started the night before and I fired up my saw... funny something seems weird.  I started noticing tons of play in the throttle and then my throttle wasn't working at all.. GREAT.  I walked my saw back out to the road because working with small parts in the middle of a slash pile is a great way to loose parts; expensive imported from Germany Stihl parts.  Once I got to the road I tore the whole saw apart except and found that the problem had to be in the trigger assembly.  Low and behold the trigger assembly uses a smaller torx bit than the rest of the saw.  I spent a while walking up and down the road looking for someone to borrow tools from but everyone had disappeared.  Our block is only a little ways from the saw shop so I packed up and headed in to get some professional repairs.  Long story turned short the throttle cable had broken inside the trigger assembly and needed to be replaced.  30mins and every employee in the shop looking on had the problem fixed and, lucky me, it was under warranty.  I got back to the block and my partner had just about finished the strip we were on ( I think I mentioned that this stuff was creamy ) so we got it done and then .. REDNECK MUD FEST!  yup..  noontime and another truck to get unstuck, this time I did the honours and 3 BIG tugs got another ranger out of the hole and we just about took his bumper with it.  I got a Tim Horton's Cappuccino for the rescue effort .. STOKED!  The day was going great.. it was 2:30 and we were just about done the strip we were in so we decided to claim another for the morning to minimize the chance that too many guy show up and get an unwanted "break"  But as we walked up the road it became apparent that there was some kind of uproar in the thinning community....  Papers, if the checker (who works for the forestry marketing board ) fails your strip you get papers.  A strip could fail for a million reasons: too many trees cut, not enough trees cut, wrong kind of trees cut or not cut, trees laying in place they shouldn't be, stumps too high... whatever.  EVERYONE had papers... except us.  We decided not to "claim" another strip, which is kind of frowned upon just incase we had in-fact received papers.  If you get papers you have to drop everything and go back to the offending strip and fix whatever it is your paper says in wrong.  I tip toed up to the truck and peeked into the cab.... no papers! We were happy but not quite convinced since seasoned vets had got papers and really, their quality is better than ours.  We stopped into the office on the way home to get our pay stubs and low and behold we go a paper too.  A single paper is no big deal and we can get it fixed up in one tanks of gas each but shit.. you don't make any money dicking around fixing stuff that's already been cut.  And to the checker that failed us.. screw your mother, your grandmother and the horse you rode in on! and.. uh..  um.....          Your favorite band sucks!

      WHEW-WEEEE!  this new block is dope!  Creamy like cream has never been creamed.. I'm gonna have to get like a Baxters or Northumberland dairy sticker for my helmet.    We BLAZED through our 1st strip and got a pile done on the second  I can't imagine the rate's gonna be that good but really, after the last two blocks I've really needed something stress-free like this.  In other news I got my truck stuck going in this morning but got out without any help and that's about it.  peace outside.

      Man.. the block still sucks and the bugs still suck and then it started to rain.  There was only one other truck from the crew out today so I was able to find out that it takes exactly 38mins to walk all the way into the strip from where I can park my truck, awesome.  All in all it was a good day it didn't start to rain until about 3pm so we were more than happy to stash the saws and head out for the day.    The threat of rain and the holiday kept everybody but us and the Guatemalans out of the woods.. wimps!   Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      We were over in Maine yesterday to visit some of my girlfriend's exentended family and It occured to me that, in general, health standards in the states are a little more relaxed than here in Canada.   Deet is the active ingredient in all real bug repellant. Unfortunately deet has also be linked to some health problems over the years causing Canadian food and drug to limit the amount to 30% in repellants sold within our borders.   On the other hand; the Houlton Me. Walmart still caries the old school, plastic melting, lip numbing, eye burning, 100% deet original hard core stuff. I smuggled back 2 bottles of Repel 100.

      Have you ever seen a photo of those old time chinese circus bicycle stunt shows?  Yesterday, 1 foreman, 4 thinners, 4 clearing saws, 1 chainsaw and a full complement of water and gas cans rode into the block all together on a single Suzuki 4x4 ATV.    I was thinner number 3.

      It was another drizzly wet day but it wasn't nearly as cold so I didn't mind much.  We started and finished a strip that was nice and creamy so that helped the situation too.  A couple days ago, on the road into the block, someone placed a moose skull up on a pole that stares at you on the way in.  Today I found my own moose skull.  Now there's two moose skulls up on poles guarding the road into the block.    I'll have to come up with an appropriate name for the block on my timecard that reflects its osteo-personality.

      Well yesterday was the last day that the Newfoundland crew was working with us.  I thought they were pretty good guys but alot of the other guys had problems with them.  The one big plus I see is that now we'll be able to work a block for more than a few days before we have to move.  The Newfies were super fast and were doing 75% of all the available strips on any given block making it hard for us to get more than one strip before having to move on.  Moving-on ALWAYS entails screwing around which means lost money.  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      Every second Monday is "time card hand-in" day.  What this usually means is everyone spends half the day sitting in their trucks at the entry-way to the road into the block.  We do this so our foreman who no-longer has 4x4 in his truck (regardless of what the stickers on the quarter-panel say) can get to us and get us paid.    The other every second Monday ritual that goes along with this is that something happens to defeat the previous ritual's purpose... Today kept true to form.  We got our paper work (failed blocks) cleaned up by 9:30am and headed back out to the road.  When we got there we ran into 3 more crews that were all bitching in the road about the outfit.  Rumours of who'd quit and how close others where to quitting.  And we got the news that there were no more strips left at the old block.  We headed in to the office to get our time cards looked after but the runners still hadn't gps'ed the old stuff so we had no firm numbers to calculate pay.  I called the foreman on his cell to see where we should be headed to next and he assured me that he was out at the old block and there were strips left... oh.. and that he was stuck up to the damn axles in mud. But he assures me it won't be a big deal to get out and he'll be right along.  Noon comes by and there's no strips at the old block and an even bigger set of crews is hanging on the road bitching.  I borrow a cell and call the foreman.  He's still stuck.  I get enough info out of him to figure out how to get into the next block but its not layed out.   All the 2wd's follow me into the new block and all the 4x4's head out to rescue the forman.  Since nothing's layed out I don't dare start cutting since, even though I'm 99.9% sure this is the right place I sure don't wan't to cut somebody else's shit for 3 hours with no pay.  Everyone decides beer is the better option so we redneck hillclimbed out of the trans-canada ditch (the same 2wd chevy fullsize got stuck again.. ha ha) and headed home.  I stopped at the office an picked up some blue and red tape.  From here on in I'm gonna run my own damn blocks if they're not ready.. The lazy-ass line runners who can't keep ahead of us for some damn reason can gps the bastard later.  Oh.. and as for the title,  C.J. Munn Equipment on the Hanwell Road rocks.  Leather work gloves that fit for a buck a pair, sweat shop child labour all the way baby!    I bought ten pairs.

      I'm starting to have a kind of love-hate relationship with the meteorological profession.  They predict the weather and I act on those predictions.  When one of us doesn't hold up their end of the bargain I end up suffering.   The last two times it was supposed to rain I ended up sweating my nards off wearing my rain suit in the glaring sun.  Today, the forecast was for fog then rain in the late afternoon; no point in wearing a rain suit in the fog right?   wrong.

      Everyday I listen to CBC radio while I'm working.  Lots of news some decent stories and no top-40 crap.  During the school year I work in a student nightclub on campus so I end up listening to the same dance hits over and over and over again so I'm never too keen to crank up one of the local commercial stations when I'm driving or whenever esle the radio seems fit.    Today, we were out in the woods quite a bit and I couldn't get CBC to come in.. I did however get the country station.. man.. country music is hillarious, I'd never given it a real chance Sure I listen to johnny cash, and hank sr. but that's almost punk in my mind not country by today's standars.    Anyway either I've just had a musical open minded epiphany or this job is turning me into a real live redneck... whatever.  The drinkin' bone's connected to the, party bone.  The party bone's connected to the stayin' out all night long.  She won't understand it and I'll wind up all alone but the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone.  YEEEEE- HA!

      The strip was done today at about 11am so we headed out with nothing but a VERY crude map drawn on the back of an egg McMuffin receipt.    Harvey station is a good 1/2 hour from Fredericton and Frog lake is even further.  We got out into the general area using the map and then played a game of "drive around with the windows down and listen for saws"  Funny enough this worked after a while.  We pulled in to the most hostile, pot-smoking, thinning scene imaginable.  Our whole crew had been told that the next place we were going was Harvey but they hadn't told the guys who were already out there we were coming.  By the time we showed up the 4 guys who'd been working this 18ha block had allready been there for two weeks and weren't exactly making headway.  Crappy quality and very little acreage cut could very easily be attributed to the joint chain-smoking we witnessed in the hour we were out there.  They were pissed that we were there, we were pissed 'cause it was such a far drive and in the end after looking at the land you'd need to be part billy-goat just to cut it.    There was only one strip left and a guy that smelled like auto's jacket and looked like a 25 year old zz-top member said he wanted it, who was I to object?  We'll probably get screwed tommorow trying to find some new strips to cut but anything's gotta be better than driving 45mins to cut shitty ground at a shitty wage.   Oh, and did I mention it was 30 degrees celcius today?  That helped make the decision too.  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      Man, today was the kind of day that I dream about when I'm slogging around in a rainsuit in a bullshit block.  We cranked through  1.24 hectare of the creamiest stuff in the sunniest sunshine with a nice light breeze all at about 22 degrees celcius.  What a dope day!  (1.24 x $425@hectare) / 2 = $263.5 $263.5 / 8hrs = $32.93/hour  Now that's good pay!  These days are rare but they sure make all the other shitty-ness of this job seem alot less shitty.  I guess the only other thing of note is the badass wife-beater sun burn I'm sporting; I used to have/be a red-neck.. now I've got red everything.  I hope it doesn't hurt too bad tommorow.

       Work Clothes    Pants  Any type of work pants will do.  I wear duck cloth double knee Carhartt's, my partner wears jeans, and other guys wear military cargo pants and Dickie's work pants.  Whatever suits your tastes.    No -one on the other hand wears Kevlar chainsaw pants  If the saw shop tries to sell you some I'd kindly say thanks but no thanks.  Those pants haven’t been designed to jam brush-saws. Therefore there's no guarantee that they'd even help in an accident.    Shirts  Something long-sleeved is good, T-shirts, sleevelesses and tank tops are ok too.  Whatever suits your tastes and comfort.  Personally I went to the second hand store and bought 5 lightweight fabric plaid shirts for $10. (2 of them are LLBean)   Warm Wear  You also want to bring a fleece or other type of sweater and a hat with you everyday in the truck.  You won't need to wear them while you're working because you'll be getting hot enough. But when its raining, after you're done for the day you'll be gald to be able to put on something dry and warm to avoid catching a chill.     Safety Gear    Head  You'll need a hard hat, safety glasses and hearing protection.  Ear plugs are easy to find and lots of guys use them.  Get the ones with a string on them and feed it through the holes in your hardhat and you'll never loose them.  Big earmuff hearing protection can be bought to mount on your hard hat.  I prefer this style because I listen to the radio while I work and this style accommodates my headphones.  When you buy your saw you'll get a free pair of safety glasses,  THESE ARE OF NO USE TO YOU!  They're made of clear plastic and will scratch, fog, fall off, etc.  The two choice you have are to buy wire mesh glasses (about $18) or a wire mesh face protector that mounts on your hard hat. A full hard hat system covers the eyes, ears and skull and goes for about $50, this is what I use.  It uses earmuff style hearing protection, a full face flip-up mesh shield and says Stihl on it so its matches my saw (gotta look good for the gorbies!)   Hands  Any old type of work gloves is good enough.  Some guys wear cotton bricklayer gloves for the breath ability, some wear full hide cowboy style gloves for the comfort and others, like me wear standard cracked leather palm work gloves.  Get whatever feels right for you but buy at least 3 pairs.  You will want to have dry gloves available at all times and a really soaked pair of gloves will take longer than one night to dry.   Feet  To work all you need is a regular old pair of work boots, but,   if you wear these you will be miserable  .  The only real  option is to wear full height orange rubber chainsaw boots.  They come in two styles; rubber sole and caulk (cork) sole.  Caulks are spikes that are twice the size of golf spikes and double the number of them on the sole.  These are excellent for walking on slippery trees.  Rubber sole boots are better for waking on wet rocks, that’s about it.  I've tried to split the difference by having my rubber soled chainsaw boots studded with the same studs that go in winter tires.  They help and I'd like to think its the best of both worlds but if I had to buy another pair I think I'd buy some caulks.  I've busted my ass one too many times slipping on a tree I'm trying to kick down or walking over slash piles.     Rain Gear    A big yellow slicker  is probably the best choice since they're cheap and completely water proof.  Get pretty much naked or wear some light wool underneath of it 'cause it will get hot.  Also tape the bottom of your pants to your boots to avoid shredding them while you're working (remember your walking in a forest of 4" sharp spikes in a thinning strip).   Rubberized Gloves  are great to have so you don't soak your leather work gloves and they will keep you from sopping wet too bad.  In the end no rain gear is going to keep you dry when you're working in the rain. If the gear's doing its job you'll end up getting wet from the inside out anyway (sweating).    And if you think that Gortex is the answer:  First, Gortex doesn't work when its dirty (and it will be dirty) Second, do you really want to shred your $300 rain suit?  That's it for this Thinner Tech.  Next time I'll be rambling on about the correct way to carry your saw to avoid fatigue.

      Every morning I wake up and the index and middle fingers on my right hand simply will not move. Tree planters have a word for this, they call it "the claw".  Tree planters get this way from hooking a short D-handle shovel into the ground all day.  I've got this feeling because I can't for the life of me get my throttle to ease up its pull.  The trigger throttle on my saw is fuct.  From talking to tree planters apparently after you get some funny muscles build up in your hand and wrist this feeling goes away.  I've been thinning for 2 months straight and I'm still getting it.   Here's hoping for some hand steroids.. I'm calling BALCO.

      Ok, there's dissent in the thinner world.  There's a new foreman who's first introduction was to say "Hi, I'm the new foreman, you all have to go back and re-do blocks"  To make matters worse the rumour is that after this block is finished (and the other blocks are cleaned) that the choices for the Fredericton crew are to mover to Nova Scotia to work, start working for Frasier Forestry or quit.   This rumour can't be substantiated because all thinning is like the reality tv show "the mole" where everyone lies to everyone trying to get a better deal for themselves.  Needless to say the walk into the strip this morning was tense. Every day we look around to figure out who the latest person to quit was by the state of their strip. Or if we don't find a quitter's strip we find other thinners who are all to eager to put down their saws for a "conver-bitching-sation".  Instead of either of these we ran into a young buck deer just starting to grow his buttons.  If you ever thought that deer couldn't tell when hunting season was on or not you're wrong.  Two thinners (myself included) wearing mostly safety orange tromped right up on this guy to within about 20 meters and he just stared at us.  Oh right.. NASCAR camouflage.  Since things have been getting tense, even confrontational around here and people are fighting for position as to who gets strips and who doesn't I've decided to make it less obvious that I'm just a university student just doing this as a summer job, not a seasonal worker who's EI benefits depend on this by puting a Jeff Gordon #24 air freshner in my truck.  I was looking kind-of out of place being the only pickup on the crew without a "number" in the back window.

      Man.. our foreman has left to go to Nova Scotia with all the travelling thinners and we've got a new guy who works for Frasier forrestry looking after us.  I'm not sure if were running out of work or not at the end of the week, the whole St. Stephen crew is now working with us so we're back into the "I don't have a block to cut" daily problem and to sum it all up:  It rained like a bucket of crocodile tears and I lost my watch somewhere our in the strip.  In other news I bought an old cheap scanner its pretty neat to play with here's some interesting frequencies in the Fredericton Area:  Fton RCMP dispatch (non trunk) - 155.82 Fton Ambulance - 148.135 Trius Taxi dispatch - 166.350 NOAA weather recording - 162.475 NB Power Crew Radio - 142.635 Fton Ham Radio (mostly guys in RV's talking to each other) - 147.120  Check  urlLink The Maritimes Scanner Site  for other scanner related stuff for the area.

      So its 5:30am and I see a guy slowly walking down the trans-canada with a gas can.  Good semaritan mode kicks in an there we are in the truck on the way out to his car... except he doesn't remember where his car is.  He's pretty sure its down the highway but he has no idea how far.  He doesn't even know that the city he's leaving is called Fredericton.  All he knew is that he was supposted to be on his way to Norton.  That would be great if I could have rembered where Norton was myself?!?    The trans-canada around here has recently been upgraded to a divided 4 lane so there's trees in the way and you can't see a car on the other side.  This would help but the guy can't tell me if he broke down before or after the road divides.  I dropped him off as far up the road as I was going and wished him good luck.    Only after we got out and started loading up for the day did my partner (who was sitting beside the guy in the truck) let me in on the fact that you could pretty well see the rum fumes comming off him.  That explains alot!  Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      no realy, I can't stop my saw.. the new killswitch that got intalled with my new throttle cable doesn't work.  On top of that the rumour is that the new blocks aren't actually in Stanly but way further down the road in Napadogan or Boiestown.  that's like an hour and a half drive one way.  I'm not sure if I'll be sticking with this company if that's the case.  Most of the other guys in the crew have quit to work for other companies and I've got some standing offers for new work.  I'm waiting to hear back from.. wait for it.. another new foreman to find out were EXACTLY the new blocks are.  If its too far away I'm gonna look to quit.  I guess other than that.. my partner caught a snake in the block today that he's now named and plans to make his pet.

      Well, today I broke my second throttle cable in a month.  I'm not sure if its me or the saw but damn.. its anoying yo!  We had a meeting the the boss-man today after leaving the saw-shop to get my throttle fixed and it looks like we're heading to Stanley to work for at least the next the month.  There's a 140hq bid at the military base that we should get so that's closer but for the next month or so we're looking at a 110km round trip everyday.  Me and the boss man have been talking about a student recruitment program.. I can see me, a passenger van, and a summer of caos running a student crew.. I've been trying to figure out the logistics to present a proposal but I'm thinking me, and f-150 with mud tires and about 10 student thinners could make a dope summer next year.  Run all the rural blocks and keep it hardcore, not redneck.  Anyway.. we'll see.  Might have to change the weather on the site to read Stanley's weather if we go out there.

      Someone left a link to this Canada East news story in the comments of a previous post. It especially relevant to me because last Wednesday we came up on a bear cub in the road. We backed up and started our saws to make some noise and the cub took off (presumably with momma in tow). As long as you don't startle a bear, especially a momma bear they won't give you any trouble. Bear bells and other noise makers are the best preventative measure. We just walked the rest of the way out revving up the saws now and then.. no problems.   Anway here's the story:  Solen from  urlLink canadaeast.com    urlLink http://www.canadaeast.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040616/CPA/20269020    ----------------------------------------------------   N.B. forestry worker spends eight hours trapped in tree by angry bear   LAKETON, N.B. (CP) - A New Brunswick forestry worker came face-to-face with one of his job's more dire occupational hazards on Monday.   Gary McIntyre encountered an angry bear just minutes after he started work in the woods near Laketon, a small community north of Moncton, in Kent County. The bear charged and McIntyre scampered up the closest tree, only to find the bear climbing up behind him. "Her teeth were right under my boots," McIntyre told the regional television network ATV on Wednesday.   Trapped without his bear repellent or two-way radio, McIntyre was forced to hop to another tree to avoid a mauling.   "She tried to grab me for a while and after I stopped screaming, the bear calmed down," said McIntyre. "The more I screamed, the madder the bear got."   The tree now sports deep gouges where the bear clawed it in frustration.   McIntyre spotted the cause of the bear's outrage after eight hours out on a limb.   He saw her cub crawling down from the top of a 15-metre tree just a couple of metres away around dinnertime.   "By that time, the cub had come down to about seven or eight feet from the ground," said McIntyre. "The mother turned around and the cub jumped down and went with its mother."   McIntyre waited for a couple of minutes before deciding it was safe to come down from his perch.   It wasn't his first encounter with bears on the job; he was trapped up a tree for 15 minutes five years ago and ran into a mother with two cubs two years ago, though that bear walked away after a few grunts.   McIntyre said he spent most of his time in the tree praying and thinking about his family and job.   He said he likes his job and that the occasional run-in with a bear comes with the territory.

      We finished up in Fredericton and took a trip out to find the new blocks on Wednesday. Well it was 100km one way and most of it on crappy roads so it takes an hour and a half to get there. Deersdale is a "town" that only one resident.. a big Irving mill. The dirt roads are in good shape but that's almost a problem because its not uncommon to run into a convoy of loaded logging trucks coming the other direction on the narrow road at 80km/h. You think logging trucks on a two lane highway are scary try it on a dirt road.   I decided I was going to quit thinning because the driving was going to be too much but after a day off and some talking to my partner in work, my girlfriend and eventually my accountant/dad I decided that it was still worth it to travell up into the area to work.   Now, since this is full blown middle of knowhere country all vehicles have to have cb radios. These are used to announce your location every two km. There are milemarker signs on all the roads. By radio-ing your position and monitoring other vehicle positions you can avoid having two vehicles going opposite directions down a single lane.. forcing someone to back up until they can get off the road. Since I drive a 1/4ton I'd be the guy backing up.   Ok.. so CB radio installation.. shouldn't be that hard right? It wasn't.. I have a buddy that works for a trucking sales company and he hooked me up with a radio, mic and antenna for free. They were warantee returns and so far I can't find a problem with them. So, I get all this stuff and I'm impatient so I start hooking it all up in the truck right in the parking lot.   Its all hooked up and working great but I don't have the mounting braket attached, so I run up to Canadian Tire to grab a cheapy tool kit. Now the cheapy tool kit has a little zip tie holing it shut that needs to be cut.   Has your dad ever warned you never to cut towards yourself? well that was the exact thought I had just before I tried one last time to shove a big hunting knife blade under the zip tie, towards myself. Well, I'd never seen the bone in a freshly cut finger before but my gosh it sure is white. I ran around to the back of my truck and grabbed the pressure bandage that we have to cary at work and drove myself up to the emergency room. 2.5 hour wait and four stiches.. not too bad and it doesn't feel too bad today but it gets better.   When I rushed to get my bandage (squirting blood all over the place) I forgot to put my bookbag back in the truck before leaving. By the time I got back my bag had been gone through.. they stole all my tools, my ansul packs (I don't know what they'd want those for) and my walkman and water bottle... GAY. It's gonna be like $50 to replace everything.   Don't cut towards yourself! Ever!   Six Tanks of Gas - Pre-Commercial Thinning in New Brunswick - The Blog

      Well, I havn't done much with the site and my official excuse is that I've been sleeping.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've been getting up at 4am because&nbsp;until last week we continued to work out in Deersdale moving progressively farther away from Fredericton until it just became too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;We kept getting promised that ground was opening up in Fredericton but it never seemed to come.   The real story is that the only ground around the Fredericton area is private and private ground thinning is controlled by the  urlLink York-Sunbury-Charlotte Forest Products Marketing Board  (YSC).&nbsp; They have a certain budget that is equally divided between pre-commercial thinning contractors and we had long blown our quota and the company was practicing some not quite legal means of continuing to work that had finaly been shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This also explains why the YSC quality checkers were being so damn hard on us.   In Deersdale all four of the Fredericton thinners who had yet to quit (including myself) started working together on blocks so that we'd all be done at the same time should any Fredericton ground open up.&nbsp; This was good since the cutting was terrible.&nbsp; Spruce so thick that you couldn't see the blade at the end of your saw.&nbsp; We also broke two saws slowing down the process significantly.&nbsp; I blew both crank seals in my saw which set me back $75.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy I travell with completely destroyed his saw by&nbsp;melting the crank bearings and then insisting on still trying to use it.&nbsp; I wasn't there that day but everyone told him to stop but his stubborness and lack of knowlege of engines landed him with $778 worth of repairs to his saw.&nbsp; They warrantied $600 of it but it might get disalowed once the parts get to the manufacturer.&nbsp; Keep in mind that a brand new saw is only around $1000.&nbsp; The saw shop now hates him so hopefully he wont require any more work before the season's out and things cool down.   Anyway after all this the rate in Deerdale was only $385/hectare but was worth atleast $550.&nbsp; Three fast thinners still took 3 days to do a single hectare and we bured 36 tanks of gas between us.&nbsp; That works out to less than half of what we would expect to make on a a shitty day.&nbsp;  In the end we all quit working for the contractor we'd been with for the start of the season.    Three of us have ended up with a new super small outfit (4 guys and a foreman including us) and are working fairly close to town.&nbsp; The outfit seems kind of rinky-dink so hopefully there's no problems getting paid.&nbsp; The other guy had ended up working with an outfit thinning about an hour away with some of the guys from our original crew that quit 2 weeks before we did.   In the end everyone's still&nbsp;got work and were's not getting lied to (hopefully)&nbsp;everyday like we were so here's hoping for a good last month of thinning.&nbsp; I'm done to go back to university the first of September.

      Yesterday I said "The saw shop now hates him so hopefully he wont require any more work before the season's out and things cool down"  Well.. today at 12:00pm noon his angle gear died.&nbsp; That's a $322 part once taxes are added and fuck do I ever feel sorry for him.&nbsp; His warantee period ran out 5 days ago (the day he blew up last time) and the total repairs he's put into his saw in the last 2 weeks, even discounting the warranteed items comes out at $500-some doallars.. more than enough to buy a whole new saw, used.  As my partner would say, in a parisienne accent&nbsp; FEEUCKEEEING SHEEIT!
