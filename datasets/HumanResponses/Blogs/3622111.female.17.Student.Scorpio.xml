       Anybody noticed that all three of our usernames begin with an S? Hm. So good to have you guys here (even though, Mary, please post soon. --")  Still missing my book. =( Hm. It's one of my favorite love stories I've read. Alright, so I haven't read  that  many, but it's still one of my faves. It's about a principal's daughter and a troublemaker. Mmmhmmm. How do you guys like love stories anyway?  Hunting ghouls at Gothador. Muahahhaha. I'm almost at level 14. Now my AP regen rate is 18 minutes. Yay. I'm going to get sword of speed and equip myself with it when I'm not hunting. Mmmhmmmm. Yesssss.

       We've got a new Team Blog~!!! Yay~! Three cheers for that. ^^  And of course, cheers to me coz I'm the first one to post.  Brief self-intro... silverwhiskers, a.k.a. Colleen, just finished Form 6 and getting into university this September, Computer Engineering. God. What have I gotten myself into. --" Um. We can talk more about that later though.  Guys, do your own self-intro please.  Settled for the Ringlet for now coz I realized that this blog has actually been created by me when I was experimenting with names. Hm. Well, until any of us comes up with a better idea, this is going to be our blog's name for the time being.  Anyway, we're just some friends who do crazy stuff and laugh at the silliest things, and lately watched too many movies together.  Like today, watched Paycheck and a couple of episodes of Friends.  Man, Paycheck is  good . I mean, seriously. The whole concept and just the whole plot! It's excellent! Of course, not to mention the technology stuff, but I'll have to look up myself to see what reverse engineers are... Hmmm...  Hope this blog is going to last. Hehe.

        Well. I'm not really&nbsp;sure how I should do this. There are a lot of things which I guess are correct, but I wouldn't have written it that way. I guess that's what it means by style. Um. Just treat the corrections as a lowly reference, okay? After all, I'm not anyone with any authority...     &nbsp;   There are  thousands    of people buying&nbsp; pirated  CDs from street hawkers and downloading illegal MP3s from the internet  every day .  However -=don't start a sentence with the word "but"=- , these people are seldom charged guilty&nbsp;for  participating in these illegal trades .&nbsp; As  a result  -=we always say "as a result"=- , the  original producers  are losing millions of dollars in revenue!     &nbsp;   The main reason why so many people  would rather  buy illegal CDs is that these CDs are much cheaper than  the  legal ones. Downloading MP3s is also popular because it is free! People exchange songs and they can choose  whatever  songs they like. This  saves so much money -=it's not only cheaper! it's free!=-and is much&nbsp; more convenient than buying the whole CD.   &nbsp;   I think this illegal trade is very selfish  -=only selfish??? What about short-sighted? or degrading? it's better to use two adjectives, and if you do that, remove "very"=- . A lot of  effort -=EFFORT!!! UNCOUNTABLE!!!=-&nbsp; and money are needed to  produce an album -=you don't complete a CD=- .  However, -=same as above=- some people take  -=no "the" here. there are none in the question even.=- &nbsp;advantage of a bargain with the street hawkers and buy these illegal CDs out of greed. There is no difference between stealing and buying  pirated -=the word illegal is overused=- CDs because we obtain something which we  do -=keep the tenses consistent!=-&nbsp; not pay for  - not to the deserving party at least -=what do you mean, we don't pay for the CDs? Even $10 is money. We just don't pay it to the producers=- . We  lose -=verb: lose. noun: loss=- our dignity when we steal! Despite the seriousness of this crime, the problem of selling and buying illegal CDs  keeps -=tenses!=- &nbsp;worsening.  -=You haven't quite given the main point here.

         Many people buy cheap and illegal CDs from street hawkers. While it seems natural to want to take advantage of a bargain, it is illegal to buy these products and the companies who make legal copies are losing millions of dollars in revenues. Write a letter to the editor of the Young Post on this topic, stating how you think people should behave in regard to this matter, and what the authorities should do to combat the situation. Sign your name ‘C. Wong’. Do not use your real name.   &nbsp;  Every day, there are many people buying illegal CDs from street hawkers and downloading illegal MP3s from the internet. But these people are seldom charged guilty for this illegal trade. In a result, the legal CD companies are losing millions of dollars in revenue!  &nbsp;  The main reason why so many people buy illegal CDs is that these CDs are much cheaper than those legal ones. Downloading MP3s is also popular because it is free! People exchange songs and they can choose the songs they like. This is much cheaper and more convenient than buying the whole CD.  &nbsp;  I think this illegal trade is very selfish. A lot of efforts and money are needed to complete a CD. But some people take the advantage of a bargain with the street hawkers and buy these illegal CDs out of greed. There is no difference between stealing and buying illegal CDs because we obtain something which we did not pay for. We loss our dignity when we steal! Despite the seriousness of this crime, the problem of selling and buying illegal CDs keep worsening.  &nbsp;  The government has made advertisements on TV and radio which remind the public not to buy illegal CDs from street hawkers. And the companies who make legal CD copies and even the singers themselves have held many campaigns which aim to raise the public awareness of the importance of buying legal CDs and not to waste their efforts. Yet, these methods are not effective enough to combat the worsening situation.  &nbsp;  The public is indeed aware of the immorality of buying illegal CDs, but because everyone else is doing that without being caught, there is no reason why they have to spend more money to obtain the legal copies. I think the policeman should carry out more sudden inspection in the trading hot spot. They should not only catch the street hawkers, but also the people who are buying the illegal CDs, so that the public will not easily defy the law thinking that they will not be caught anyway.  &nbsp;  For the government, I think it should lay down some stricter laws regarding this crime. It should also consider increasing the punishment for committing this crime. It is important for the public to understand the seriousness of selling and buying illegal CDs. It is the only way to combat this situation. But this problem cannot be solved without the co-operation of the public. So I hope the people will stop purchasing illegal CDs when their conscience calls.&nbsp;     C.Wong    &nbsp;  * I don't know if I catch the topic...coz I read the suggested ans...it said the first paragragh of the letter should inform the reader about what the letter's topic is..The next two papragraghs give reasons for buying pirated goods. However the later writing suggested that the popularity of buying pirated goods is to do with capitalism, while the govenrment's laws are there to uphold our society's moral standards. The letter finishes  without  really providin a solution. * ^^"

       okay, i gotta finish this in 10 mins, it's only 10:45 and my mom is already yelling, ERRR!!!! i reli think this is one of the reasons why i have gotten so used to my parents not being around me for a few weeks, coz i actually like it!! --"" nevermind...  Col, your student ID is definitely my next target, and please remember i did show u my driver license!!! i will visit u some time after i get back from the U.S. for sure, it's reli nice over UST after all. and close to my new home, hohoho...i actually start getting excited about moving, probably coz it doesn't give me such a headache since i dun even have things to move there (all stuff are in the U.S. =P), it will be a big big trouble for my dad, can't even imagine him trying to move all his suits and ties and shoes and glasses and watches......  by the way, i am getting my Hong Kong driving license on wednesday, it's valid for TEN years!!! woohahahahahaha...i dun think just not getting into my car is safe enough, one of the first things i will do after getting my license is driving to u guys' homes and maybe running into them, kakaka...  oh god, just remember, i have not even STARTED packing yet!!! >  Col, about the party after u left, basically we had hot pot with sausages and fishballs, also salad by Christy's mom and chicken wings by Shell, Sarah and Mimi, i think i only had 1 sausage, 1 chicken wing and 1 bowl of salad, hahaha...we did not do much except taking pictures and watching TV, most people left at 8-ish, Mary, Shell, Victore and i left at 9-ish, but we were not even the last, woo...i was so scared that i would lose my voice today, yelled too much ^^"" and yer, Mary had a stomache last night (got up 8 or 9 times for the washroom at 3 or 4 in the morning?), we thought it might be coz of the food but no one else felt anything...probably she is a bit too sensitive ^^""  i did try to call u today at 10-ish, u did not pick it up though...anyways, call me back if u have time, have fun!!

       Hello guys!  I'm now sitting in the computer barn at HKUST, typing away merrily. Got my student card here this afternoon. No, I'm not going to show it to you guys coz the pic looks so ugly...  Thought I couldn't get online until I sat down and read the instructions carefully. I almost thought I couldn't get online until, like, two days later. That would most certainly have killed me.  The dorm is cool. Thinking about living in it and actually living in it are two totally different things. You guys should come over for lunch or something one day, and I'll show you around... I think all you need to do is sign in as visitors. But the dorm is a long way from the entrance. =.= Like, 20 minutes walk. =P Which is about the same amount of time that my mom needs to get to HKUST from my home by car. --"  By the way, someone fill me up with what happened after I left at Christy's.

Fine, so I've cursed it a lot over the years, but still...  *sighs*  I'll still be able to get online I think. I'm going to borrow a PC card and can hopefully get online in my dorm room.  Yes, time will fly. 5 weeks will be soon over. Ahhhh.  I'll see you guys later. Call me if I've disappeared for more than a few days. =P

But I was like the "middle-person"...I'm with those who started to join the team in July...but they're all very small children and 師父 said I was not going to practice the same swimming programme as them...There're about...6 teenagers...I think they're 師兄師姐...However, they don't know that I'm joining them...(and they swim so damn good)=P but that's OKAY...at least I can rest whenever I like and I swim whatever I like to swim and I don't need to follow any programme...(maybe just for the first time)...don't know about today...but I'm surely going to get nervous again soon...-_-" 肚"or" recently...for about one week already...I think that's coz of the "nervous-swimmming"...

       Step, there is no other way to make you more interested in Gothador than you trying it out for yourself. I picked it up in 10 moves. Mary... did you pick it up in 2 or 3 days? Hmmm. A happy thing happened there today coz I moved into a space with a Spawn and only got hit for 5 points! Whee! I was taking a chance there, I know. But 2 ghouls in that same box is too tempting...  What exactly did you  do  that makes you feel you've wasted your time? Lounging around in front of the television???  I have to say, even though a lot of people hate the US... Perhaps its future would be brighter than that of Hong Kong. =.= If Hong Kong is spiralling down the way A Lee always feared it is... Then the US is definitely a better choice.  Hm. And Step. We don't try to correct you coz you're beyond the help of corrections. Hahahhahhaha. Alright. Just joking. ^^"  You know what, I went to bed last night at 10... But couldn't sleep until 3. Pah. My mom said it's the coffee I had yesterday. I don't know. =.= I was tired, my head was heavy, but I couldn't sleep. Laid around until 1 sth and turned on my bedlamp and read... Finished that love story. Thought I would be able to sleep after that... but no. The story is just so nice and romantic that I couldn't sleep right away. =.= So I got online and wrote a bit... Some sort of late night confessions. =P My entries are always so blatantly honest at that hour of the day.  Oh alright. Getting to the title of this entry. I was thinking of some new names for this blog just now... Came up with a couple of words... Shared Attic? Loft? Well, I was thinking about the attic coz well... I don't know. It's just sort of the part of the house that isn't usually visited by people. Some people use it as a bedroom... some use it to store things... the point is. It's a private place.  I also looked up what an attic means in dreams and came up with this:  "To see an attic in your dream, represents hidden memories or repressed thoughts that is being revealed. It also symbolize your mind, spirituality, and your connection to the higher Self. Alternatively, it signifies difficulties in your life that will hinder you from attaining your goals and aspirations. However, in the end, after a long period of struggle, you will overcome them."  I don't know. What do you say?

       i guess i am a bit late, i already missed 5 entries!!  Col, u gotta make me feel interested in that G game first =P  these few days were so weird, esp. yesterday and today, i spent at least half of my time alone, yes,  alone , coz somehow my parents and my bro just got stuff to do and got out of home all at the same time, oh well...the worst thing is probably i dun think i spent that time in a right way, i just totally wasted it, eh......if i wanna waste my time, i dun have to do it in Hong Kong, this makes that waste of time an EVEN BIGGER waste --"" yer i would be happier if i wasted my time in the U.S., or instead, if i had time to waste in the U.S....  talking about that, did i mention that i  hate  that country? and my whole family hates it? and all of us wanna break the TV or curse Bush whenever the news talks about the U.S. policies? and my parents sent us there? kinda funny (and ironic, sadly)...okay, i know, not the time to talk about that anymore, everything is set...  umm, coming back to Hong Kong is not exactly ESCAPING, there's no way i can reli run away and relax...i always feel something heavy is on my shoulders and pressing on me (i bet u all that if my mom just stopped buzzing like she is now, that weight would be a bit lighter, ARGH!!), and this probably won't go away till i retire, this is life, i guess...=P  once again, nice to have this place, i actually have a way to say a lot of stuff that i dun wanna tell most people, probably except u guys? coz many others will only try to CORRECT me instead of listening and trying to understand, at least u guys won't reject what i say...  i am not feeling that well today, nah, i am not sick =P mentally, emotion swing probably? it's so sudden, and this happens more often now, strange...  better go now, tired, and my mom is asking, no, TELLING me to get downstairs, cya around

Really liked the small bit about Pinocchio. Hehe.  And I'm on Level 16 now at Gothador. Whee~! Now my best AP regen time is 13 minutes. **grins**  Step, you've got to start playing. I'll even help by giving you a Short Sword.  And Mary... I doubt if you'd pay attention to the shark if Orlando Bloom is swimming in front of you. Hmmm.

        urlLink Ad-aware - Software - Lavasoft   Just recommended this one to Sharon. Actually, think it's a must-have. Go download. ;)  Well, I'm just thinking we should stop with the short comments. It's better to make them into entries... Yes? Hm.  My mom got me the Da Vinci Code from Canada. I kinda like it coz it's a hardcover version... but actually feel strange when everyone else are reading the bookcover version. =P Oh well. I'm almost done with Chapter 9. Mary... I'm going to catch up with you soon enough. Hehe.  Feel that I'm having a burnout. I don't have any appetite for anything. Everything seems boring. I mean, you gotta realize I'm having a problem when the notion of playing games like Hexic, Texttwist or the likes become boring to me.  Wei said it might be my hormones... well. Perhaps. I  am  having my period these few days, but it's most probably not the major factor. I mean, I've been like this for more than a couple of days. I think it's coz I've been so stressed for the past few months, what with my head prefect duties, SAT tests, university applications and final exams, all one after another. I didn't even get a proper break during Easter.  Step... at least you can always escape to Hong Kong. I don't have that privilege. --"

       I went cruising yesterday. The Hong Kong Observatory put up the amber rainstorm signal, so Step phoned early in the morning that her mom didn't allow her to come...hum...that certainly had lessen my excitment...... Nevermind...then changed into "beach style", packed loads of snacks, food and drinks and leave home at 8:30a.m.  Many fds and relatives have already arrived the Kowloon City Port when we arrived. well...this cruising really involved many parties...haha....my whole big family, dad's boss and his son, 8 ventures, another scout leader and his friends...about 28 ppl in total...wou..  The ship...oh..shall I call it a ship? ...It's not VERY beautiful, but comfortable enough...air-conditioned cabin, can sing K ^^", and spacious coz the ship was for 40-50ppl originally... It started off at 9 sth towards Sai Kung 大浪西灣. It took about 1.5-2 hrs...We took photos, played cards, ate snacks, rested..................and arrived 大浪西灣 at about 11:30. I knew that it was beautiful, just I havn't been there before.......It's really beaufitul...yeah...^^" Sky was clear...waters clean and blue...and the beach was NOT crowded....   I and my cousin coz immediately jumped off from the second "floor" of the ship into the deep cool water..haha...It was the first time I jumped off from THAT tall...^^" a little bit nervous before jumping...but....erm...erm...erm....I couldn't be beaten by my one-yr smaller cousin! right!??? haha....tell you...the fright when you look down the sea before jumping and the 離心feel when jumping is .....similar to that you're playing 跳樓機!!! or even more frightened  hah!   Al'right...then we swam straight towards the sandy beach..about..150-200m...on my way towards the beach...guess what was on my mind? SHARK!!!!!! Man...I've watched SO many Amercian shark scary film....^^" My motive was to swimswim and swim until I reach the shore before I saw any dark figures under the sea...^^"   The sand there was .....sandy.....real small grains...I couldn't even find small rocks there....so beautiful....a venture brought a floating bed and we played for half an hr...Then I and Cheron (my cousin) swan back to the ship...This time the "jorney" was shortened coz of the tides...  We were the first one to jump off the ship..and we were also the first one to have lunch...hehe...快, 是最緊要的嘛.....We've chicken wings, 糯米雞, some 內臟s...^^", sausage and pineapple....so on and so on.....After some time, we again jumped off and swam towards the shore again....-_-" under that sunny sun....( It was after I went home and bath and saw that VERYVERY deep swimming suit SEAL on my back, then could I sense how stubborn I was not to apply suncream on my back...-_-" my back really burns....my shoulders so painful...sigh....I mean...you always get so excited when playing and won't think of the consequence...you don't usually care much...-_-" and that's it....except those part covered by my swimming suit...all other skins are darkened 99%...-_-" really wanted to scream when I first saw the mark on my back...-_-" dammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammit!)  okok...then we played on the beach and then swam back to the ship....jumped off the ship again and again...-_-" Then played "cum" 棉" toi" with the venture. They said the one who lose have to jump off the ship...haha...of coz I was not the one who have to jump...I'm sooooo quick-to-react....hehe...We played til 4:00pm and had to return. We chatted about scouts...CEs (others)...and many other things....um....in fact we were just 7+1ing... nth special...We arrived Kowloon City Port early...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The first thing dad did when arrived back home was of coz turned on TV...^^" 天龍八部finale....=P Then I watched The Apprentice finale...Bill won...^^" The finale was really exciting...made me couldn't sleep until 2...-_-" I had like....sleeping-on-a-boat feel already...and I was SO tired...and my back and face burned...-_-" red hot....so damn uncomfortable....later I slept...*fainting..so tired* ..^^"  but still...cool day....

       i was freaken yelling when the ref did not do anything about that so-called goal (reminded me of Argentina's "God's Hand" Vs England), okay, he did have a pretty good game except that goal, but it's a goal after all, everything might be changed if he made a right judgment (plus usually a penalty kick is given for a handball, that could reli change EVERYTHING), i dun worry about his safety, since i would not even care if he was torn into pieces 2molo --"" the Chinese team had such a great game, the Japanese are just lucky, dammmmmit...dun miss the game 2molo, M.U. Vs Arsenal at 9:55pm i think, woo...  Mary, i am free that day (hold on, my parents MAY take me to Macau AGAIN since some of their friends are going there that weekend, man, i dun reli know if i can stand going to Macau 3 times in one holiday), but what if i dun wanna swim and i dun reli know that many people there...what time will it be after all?

       Damned ref.  He might as well be BLIND. =P  Why wouldn't he see what he's supposed to see?  How could he let the Japs walk away when it's so obvious that it's handball???  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  He's BLIND!!!! BLIND!!!!!!!!!  I worry for his safety.  He probably wouldn't be able to leave our country in one piece...  Btw, Mary, it's called cruising...? Not free. Going to Zhongshan for two days with parents. Just to get away from everything. You know. Especially the Stress and Tension. =P

       the conclusion is all those could be prevented if u did not go swimming, hahahah...losing the cell phone is reli a diaster, stolen --"" it will probably give u such a big lesson that u will be very very careful next time when u go to public places ^^"" take care, sometimes it's quite easy to get sick after swimming...  i am back to work again, every tuesday and thursday, it's sooooo tiring, yes, sitting there all day long is actually very tiring, esp. i can't sit for such a long time otherwise my shoulders and back will be so sore and painful and all that...but the most important point is, of course, i dun get paid!!!! --"""
