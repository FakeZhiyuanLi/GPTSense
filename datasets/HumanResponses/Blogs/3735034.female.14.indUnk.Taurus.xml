      Well basically I slept like until 1:00 afternoon because I was on the phone with chris until 3:00 in the morning! Yeah it was crazy I said bye a few times but we just ended up talking more....He invited me to go bridge jumping but my mom didn't let me  (it was too dangerous)  Well then I Just went over to rosalee's and veronica came over aswell We went and got a blizzard(cookie dough) yummm I havn't had ice cream in a LONG time. Then I saw in rosalee's closet these xxL T-shirts that said "Quality Pest Control" and above the pocket is said Phil. So I put it on and of course it went down to my ankles so I thought it would fit better if I stuffed it.....Well I did. And I looked like a FAT man. Not only that rosalee found her old backstreet boys cd. She put it on, so not only was I a FAT man I was a FAT man dancing to the backstreet boys. HAHA it was halarious!   "Backstreets back ALRIGHT!"    Much love Finchy

      I just got back from that water park with rosalee and tanaua. It was lots of fun, it seems boring but it really wasn't that bad at all. And there was this guy that looked like the main singer of rancid lol he had a mowhawk and everything he looked JUST like him. He followed us everywhere we went it was kinda scary, then he achully had the guts to come up and talk to us...his name was jason. Yeah that was pretty funny...  I FOUND MY CD CASE! uhh I was looking EVERYWHERE for them..and guess where they were? In the shoe basket..out of all places   "Even the most beautiful roses die"   Much love Finchy

      Today my cousin left today :( it was fun while it lasted. Then I went to target and looked at the cds, Didn't find anything. except the cds I already have that are IN MY CD CASE THAT I CAN'T FIND!! GOD I'M GOING CRAZY WITHOUT UMMM.....Anyways then I went to the food corner like they always have and got a drink(The boy was very cute) We talked awhile and he was very very nice. When he gave me the change back he held my hand for like a minute.....it was kind of awkward and sweet at the same time lol.   Besides that JAMES ASKED OUT NICOLE YAY!!! I am very happy for James....he soooo deserves it! He deserves the best possible!   "We are the two pieces that finish the puzzle"  Much love  Finchy

      Ok so my cousin came on friday in the afternoon And shes super cool. We have like everything in common it's awsome! We played the guitar for a while and I tought her some stuff that was fun. Then today my cousin and my sisters (mikie,hannah,kayla)and I went to the mall and then went to hannah's to swim in the pool and left there around like five....Hannah isn't REALLY my sister we just call it cause we've known eachother for such a long time and hannah's older sister is kayla which is best friends with my sister so were all like sister's....That could of been soooo much easyer to explain!   Today: LOTS OF FUN!    "It's getting better.......But theres still a hole burning through my heart"   Much love Finchy

      I hate it.......Why is it that you try to talk to someone and you feel like a complete idiot when they act like "ok I really dont want to talk to you" and ecspecailly when you kno not long ago you break up with someone and you guys don't talk! I guess it's not simple...But so big deal we aren't going out why does it have to be that way? I still want to be good friends, but i guess it's not gonna be that way for atleast a while or maybe never   IF I affended ANYONE I'm SORRY I didn't mean to!    "It's getting better....But theres still a hole burning through my heart"   Much love  Finchy :)
