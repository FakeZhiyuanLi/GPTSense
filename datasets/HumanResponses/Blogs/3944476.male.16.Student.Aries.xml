       Haix...Sians man. Everytime i visit someone's blog, i'll end up being extremely bored and disappointed. They're all like BORING... They suck. Ok, blog is bout personal shit, but if u wanna write bout happens in your daily life, u might as well keep a diary and save everyone from the misery of reading your blog. Well, there are cool ones like DAMIEN (404)  urlLink http://fcuk-u.blogspot.com  and RYAN (412)  urlLink http://gayfag.blogspot.com.  But most peeps are just boring. It's like readin a time-table. Come on man, if u think people are interested in reading about your boring life, go suck your own penis. If u don't know how, here's how, courtesy of some site i found on the net. I haven't tried it before cause i'm not boring. So go on, learn and practise, you boring shitheads.      [ Copied enitrely from  urlLink http://www.sex-project.com/syod.shtml ]           Suck Your Own Dick   Written by "Buck9"      A big dick and a limber body don't belong to everyone, but if you can already get pretty close there are a few tricks you can do to improve and hopefully, get that incredible rush that comes when you finally make contact between your tongue and your own dick.I first sucked my 9 inch dick at age fourteen and I think an early start helps. I laid off for a good ten years and when I started again, it took work to get back in contact. I've been doing it again for about two years, but lately have come to the belief that practice *definitely* pays off. Before, I could only lick the tip with real strain, legs thrown over my head. Now I am getting the whole juicy head in my mouth plus some shaft, and I can lick halfway down my dick and taste my balls. I can also now suck it standing up and sitting down.        Some tips: Don't even bother trying in the morning. Most people are too stiff when they wake up. At end of day, your body's a lot looser. A full stomach holds you back. Stretching is a huge help. Here's a few starters: Legs together in front of you, seated on the floor. Lean forward, stretching your upper torso lengthwise across legs. Reach hands past feet to lengthen your back. Go back and forth between this position and the same stretch with soles of feet together/knees pointed out, rounding your back more than with straight leg version (tuck your head under. Do it naked! Look at that dick!) Sit upright on floor with one heel at crotch and the other leg extended straight out as far to the side as you can bring it. Slowly bring your chest down over the extended leg. Take your time, this is a good one for loosening both your back and your hips. Lie on stomach, hands at shoulders. Push up so your back arches backward. Hold, crane your neck upward, lengthen your spine. Loosen your neck. It helps ease the stretch. There are many more stretches, and taking a few yoga classes, you'll probably choose a few that really help. Try different techniques. Head-over-heels is usually a good warmup. Try standing up and grabbing your thighs from behind. Pull outward with your back so your spine loosens and gets used to being rounded. Always focus on your dick. Move this grip up and down your thighs to the position that feels closest to your dickhead and remember (always) to TILT YOUR HIPS toward your face so that dick head gets closer. Don't expect to reach it the first time... or the tenth. But try this, then go back to head over heels and see if you're closer. Use a mirror! Visualizing is half the battle. And if you prop a mirror on the back of your thighs while you're head-over-heels, seeing how close your hardon is to your mouth will help you get a lot closer -- the effect is wild. Don't get too crazy. Pop your load (it's hot seeing that, too) before you break your back. Propping feet on the wall or something is good for head-over-heels, basically because it helps you to arch your back where it may not be used to arching. Push on the wall and you can bring your hips down closer to your face.       These are just a few tips. Don't rush things. Spend an hour stretching three nights a week for a week or two before you even give it a try. Obviously, a lot of exploring helps. You have to remember to use that idle time to your advantage! (Trust me, it's fucking worth it).        Well, i gotta say, the asshole who wrote this shit is fuckin sick. Hope he chokes on his own penis one day and die.....

       Today, i decided to confess. I can't keep pretendin anymore. Many people think i'm wild and retarded. But the truth is, I'm kinda a shy guy. In fact, i am sure that i can never pick a girl up. Not guts. I mean, it's so embarrassin.. I don't even know the chick, wad if i get rejected? Bleah... Screw it. That's why i'm still single.     &nbsp;   So wad I am tryin to say is that... I'm not retarded... So please don't compare to those handicapped people. It's just evil.. And if i was retarded, I'll look something like the picture below.     &nbsp;

       Sians... Got screwed by Goh Pok Kien and J.Liew. All because i told a lie.. I mean, wad's the big deal? Just coz i'm lazy to take out my diary out of my bag and told them that i left it in class, and i got myself in a deep pile of shit. If only GPK didn't see me, i'll be happy now. For your info, i skipped detention as well. Who gives a damn, i mean, they(the skool)&nbsp;wanna&nbsp;us to study for the O s, yet they pose a lot of problems to us. How ironical. Yesterday, everyone from SEC 2 3 4 had to go down to the National Stadium to support our track team. Their excuse was that this is the closest that the track team had got in beatin the GIANTS in the track events. WADDAHELL? We didn't even win gold! Plus, why can't the school hire some professional cheerleaders? They're good, better than us. I'm pretty sure the skool's rich, just stingy.     &nbsp;   Calculation on how money the skool sucked out of the students every year:    1 person= (12months X $150/monthly) + $200 Miscellaneous Fee    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$2000    Each class consists of&nbsp;approximately 30 people    Each level consists of 12 classes    Therefore, total amount of money= $2000 X 30people X 12classes per level X 4 levels &nbsp;  = $2880000, $2.88million a year!!! (excludin foreigners who pay $300&nbsp;a month)     &nbsp;    Bloody shitheads........

       Yay. Saved 5 bucks today. Sneak into some shit concert in skool. Called the KINDRED SPIRIT, i believed that it is a bloody waste of money and an event where guys from my skool show off their girls. Thank god i didn't spend a single penny on the shit. It was so screwed up, i guess, even a person sufferin from insomnia will fall asleep throughout the entire "concert". I swear i'll eat my own shit if i wasted my money on it. All the so-called "musicians" are more of "drama actors". The exaggerate every single action, like a girlfriend stealing pianist by the name of zul, was swaying his head round and round while playin the piano. It's not as if he's playin some mozart piece of some shit.   Amazin discovery. Most of&nbsp;the dudes of my skool have girlfriends. Okay, not such a great discovery but even shitheads like SATISH has one! (Quite ugly but not as bad as EDMUND'S     &nbsp;  Girl: Hello. A/S/L   Me:16 M SG   Girl: Cool. Me XXXX   Me: Cool   Girl: Yeah   Me: Okay   Girl:.....   Me:....   ....................................(no reply&nbsp;for eternity)    &nbsp;  Okay, i suck at chatting all right. But waddafuck. I mean, i don't even know the person i'm chattin with. She or he ain't got&nbsp;nothin to do with my life. So fuck off. Seems like even the ugly guys in da world got all da hot chicks This sucks.    &nbsp;  .     .     .  .  Courtesy of  urlLink http://www.uglyfootballers.com

          Today skool was boring, we sang sang sang sang sang National days songs. Stupid propaganda shit. The most stupid thing bout today is that i spent one hour to go to skool, one hour to return from skool, and skool only lasted for one and a half hour!! Bleah, knew i should have  just skipped skool today.         10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT SJI:   1.Having to listen to the principle's long and boring speech every monday   2.Having to spend an hour to go and return from skool   3.Having to eat within 30 miserable recess minutes (includin queueing and cleanin time)   4.Having to clean canteen tables after recess   5.Having to pay $150 a month....   6.The fact that we cannot use most of the facilities in the skool. (eg. field, gym, weights room, tennis court, etc)   7.The fact that soccer is not a CCA   8.The fact that students cannot gel their hair. (possibly the only skool with this rule)   9.The fact that the teachers get all the toilet papers in the staff toilet while the students have to scavenge for toilet papers.   10.The fact that Kefli is my Geog/SS teacher.       Hecks, today's ANNUAL PARADE. Not marchin, my uniform has been decomposin in the AIR ROOM for bout 3months already. When i took it home yesterday, it was rotten, filled with moulds and possibly some mushrooms. BLEAH. My CSM wanna make me do 150 pushups for my lack of commitment in the NCC. Well i gotta tell him this, FUCK U. He aint gonna touch me coz if he does, im kickin his ass.

        Today was retarded. Well, everyday's a retarded day. I'm typin out my blog with my left hand while eating burger with the other, so there might be some typing mistakes. Bear with it.   Today my history techer played a prank on us. She claimed that we all did badly for some shit assignment and she's gonna bring us to the Deputy Principle (bitch by name of Goh Pok Kien) and we're supposed to explain to the bitch why we did so badly. The, while walkin towards the office, she stopped us and pulled a sign that says "GOTCHA!". Bleah. I had creatviely came up with an excuse and was kinda panickin coz i got scolded from the bitch before bout the lying incident  (read ".....") . Shit, now i can't recall it. But waddahell, Mrs Lajender (history teacher) is one of the coolest teachers around, so i would like to thank her for this memoriable moment.   Today, i also found out the number of people that hates KEFLI. Check out my  TRUE BLUE LOSER  entry. As of 3/8/2004, 7:04pm, there are two anonymous comments bout him. Check it out. It seems that many people hates him. Well, i dont blame them, he's a loser for sure. Read RYAN'S (412) blog,  urlLink http://gayfag.blogspot.com/ . There's an entry bout some interestin incident. Words that had been used to describe Kefli by Josephians themselves. " Loser,Homer Simpsons, Backstabbin S-O-B, Bastard,etc."   As a Josephian, i decided to check out how many more people hates KEFLI.       My interview with guy 1.   Me: Eh, you guys hate Kefli ah?   Guy1: Ya. He's an idiot, and likes to put words into people's mouth.   Me: Really?    Guy1: Ya, he hates me. And everytime i make a mistake, he'll scold me.   Me: Wad an ass..Chill man, i've experienced that before.      My interview with Guy2   Me:Eh, you guys like Kefli?   Guy2: Not anymore...      My interview with Guy3   Me: Eh, Kefli also hates you ah?   Guy3: Ya... He seems to target me all the time. Just coz i never do his work. It's not as if i'm the only one.   Me: True, true. A lot of people never do his work.   Guy3: Aiya, that guy's a loser ah.. Try to teach people english, but his english sucks. And sometimes, when we corrects his english, he'll get pissed off.       Well, these are just a few people who hates Kefli. Obviously i can't type out of all them right? By the way, these interviews are REAL and i cannot reveal the identities of these people as their safety will be at stake. I bet that there are more out there. The question is... Who to be blamed? The students or the loser? My opinion is.. THE LOSER is to be blamed and no doubt bout that.         P/S: This is NOT an anti-Kefli message. I'm just merely statin facts and stating how i feel bout him. So please hate Kefli at your own will and not because you have read this entry.      PP/S: Before i go, check this Japanese babe out man. Name: Chisato Morishita. Can be found at RYAN's blog.

        Shit, life really sucks. I simply waste many many years of my life in skool. Let's see, from the age of 5, i enter kindergarden. It sucks, but they try to make it fun by addin like 30 min of playtime where we got to sit down and play with old and outdated action figures. Still remember singin stupid songs like "A-B-C-D...." Bleah. U know the rest. 2 years wasted. How stupid. Then came primary skool, another 5 years wasted. Spent like 5 min everyday singin the NATIONAL ANTHEM as if it was so important. [5 min X 5 days a week X 4 weeks a day X 10 months of skool a year = 1000 min a year!!!] Hecks. Then now i'm in secondary skool, another 4 years. Then either JC (2years, then 4years in university) or Poly (3years). So i'll probably spend 18 years of my life studying. Shitz, wished i was a buddha, meditate 24/7.  Well, there's a sayin that goes "If u fail to plan, u're plannin to fail." Yes, whoever made up this quote must be weak in English. So, I've decided to plan out what i'm gonna do for the rest of time in SJI.  1. Study for O levels. 2. Try out Japanese food (Not sure whether HALAL or not) 3. Play in the GYM (as in the gymnasts shits) without gettin busted. 4. Steal soccer/rugby/hockey/hand balls. 5. Call KEFLI a LOSER so loud that he'll hear me. 6. After that, possibly get a PINK/YELLOW form. 7. Fake illness, get a BLUE form. 8. Steal the SJI flag. 9. Sneak into the teachers' toilet and pee all over the floor. 10. Pass my O levels with flyin colours.  HECKS MAN. Don't wanna turn out to be like a nerd by time i leave SJI. Scared i'll be like my brother, studies till 4am on weekends. Crazy boy. I don't think being smart is just memorisin ur facts, i think it's about logic and understandin. So if anyone who reads this is a nerd, I know that they're plenty out there, give yourself a kick in the ass. And those who're cool like me,(yeah rite), congrats and u may buy yourself a lollypop.

       Today i made some fuckin cool discoveries. Probably coz i've got nothin better to do anyway. Can't give a fuck bout the upcomin oral. I know that i suck, so why bother. Maybe i'll practise later.      Fuckin cool discoveries:   1. Chocolates can kill dogs.   2. A hippopotamus can run faster than a man (whooo...)   3. 'Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia' is the fear of long words. (huh?)   4.It is impossible to lick your elbows. (Try it!)   5.Every 2000 frowns make a wrinkle.    6.Only human and horses have hymen (Er?)   7.During the female orgasm, endorphines are released, which are powerful painkillers. (So headaches are in fact a bad excuse not to have sex.)   8.The first known contraceptive was crocodile dung, used by Egyptians in 2000 B.C   9.There are two types of female orgasms. One called ciitorial orgasm and the other, vaginal orgasm.   10.The G-spot of a female is called the Grafenberg spot, named after the researcher who "discovered" it and sbout 10% of females can "ejaculate". (interesting)      Sians.. Damn bored...

       Back again. Feeling extremely tired now. Sneaked out today at 3.30am after watchin Man Utd lose to Ac Milan by penalties in the American Tour. Then go skate till probably 6.30 and reached home at 7:45, before my parents woke up. Heheh. While i was sleepin today, i had a weird dream. I saw KEFLI in my dream. And in my dream, i was laughin at his ugly face coz he's such a loser.      I remembered the day KEFLI took over my Geography class last year. My first impression was, "Haha, stupid mat." He couldn't control the class then, he can't control the class now. I knew from the first day when he took over my class that my geography's gonna get totally fucked up at the end of my skool days in sji. But whodafuck cares? He lets us slack. That's most important. Also, he looks like your typical computer geek. So everyone had a lot of fun in makin fun of him. In fact, he didn't know that he was being made fun of, maybe coz he's stupid.       He got pissed of with me one day coz i told him that he can't control the class, (which is very true) and threatened to make an example out of me. So wad? My geog's screwed anyway. Once he sent me out of the class coz i asked gareth for the time. Bleah, loser. His 'best frens' make fun of him behind and in front of his face. Yet, he still doesn't seem to get the point. The REAL ones who are innocent are antagonised and the pussies he loves are the one that's scratchin him behind his back.      And it always seems that he's tryin to get on my nerves. Thank god he's ugly. At least when he scolds me, i'll be laughin my balls off. During the track and field finals, he wanted to get Jude Tan to scold me as i was not in my NCC uniform. Little did he know that many other cadets (includin the high rankin) were not wearin their NCC uniforms as well. LOSER. The next day, he scolded me, claimin that i was the WORST SENIOR CADET (thank you). But it seems that he doesn't know the NCC unit very well as there are other pricks that are worse of than me. LOSER AGAIN. He even said that he would stripped my CCA points, but only if he had the power. You know why he doesn't have the power? COZ HE IS A FUCKIN LOSER! Dammit man, sometimes i pity this motherfucker. Wait, actually i don't. I pity his wife for marrying such a loser. Now she's pregnant again. Hang in there Mrs. KEFLI.      I heard from some frens of mine that he cried in class 412 one day, coz of one boy in 410. See i told ya he can't control the class. Furthermore, it's just one dude whom other teachers don't seem to have a problem with. The loser said that he's gonna punch this dude's balls till he can't have kids. He said he would be satisfied even though he'll be in shit. Pls... He can't even hurt an ant. It's more likely that the loser will get HIS balls punched. At the end of the day, the cryin incident was made into a joke (OBVIOUSLY).      So I REALLY hope he's readin this. In fact, i wanna give an award to him (HOW KIND). So, without further delay, i award him with the LOSER award. Yay!!! Congrats you son of a bitch.

       Today's the first day of skool after a long 4day break. But it was fucked. First of all, i was late. But thanks to my skillful abilities, i managed to sneak in without having to attend detention. For your info, i've got 2 detentions that i need to attend and i've managed to escape detention 3 times by sneakin into skool. Okay, first thing in the mornin, Mr Sydney Tan made a whole bunch of students run around the track, includin me. Reason: when the music started playin [signal to assemble at track] many people were still walkin slowly and takin their time. So punishment? Run around the track once.Yeah, what a great way to start your first day in skool.      After the "mornin jog", i made my way to class, just to find out the Mrs. Sng [Math tutor] was pissed off. Dunno what's her problem. Many told me that she was pissed cos no one asked her questions bout the math assignment that she gave us. So she thought that we were acting smart or stuff like that. Well, can't blame the class you know. She's like a lion, always shoutin at us. And now, we gotta hand in PERFECT assignments or we'll have to do the assignment again 10 TIMES!!! Waddafuck. But Mrs Sng is a great math tutor, despite her very bad temper. Then i sat for a binomial theorem test which i totally forgot about. And by miracle, i passed, still havent know my marks yet. Or maybe it's becoz Mrs Sng's just great.      During geog elec, Mr. KEFLI [the loser] apparently sent Anirudh out becoz he was mockin him. For your info, Kefli took part in one of the National Day Celebration items, and as usual, he was a joke. Everyone made fun of him as he dance on stage in his baju kurung. Very funny indeed. Well, Kefli's not a proffesional teacher. I've never seen a teacher sent out a student just coz he said, "sir, you dance very nice that day". Not only that, he also sent out another person coz he mentioned the word "dance". Bleah, Kefli's a loser.      After skool, i went for history remedial. Best part, Mrs Laj [the teacher who played the gotchatrick on us] brought some biscuits and the class was muchin away as she conducted her lesson. What a great way to end a long weird day. Honestly though, this is certainly NOT my typical skool day, coz usually, i'll be sleepin in class, coz it's too boring.....

         Argh.... Can't believe it man. Singapore Idol sucks to the core. Interestingly though, many people thought that  "Singapore Idol Rocks!".  Yucks man. It's truly disgusting. Can't believe all the self-deluded shit heads who think that they can actually sing. Please..... My fart sounds nicer. Whats more fascinatin is that all these retards actually had the balls to even audition!! Not countin the long hours waitin for their turn. Yet, many people think the that Singapore Idol is really cool. My ASS! Maybe these people are deprived of REAL QUALITY ENTERTAINING SHOWS. I bet watchin Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than Singapore Idol.      But wad irritates me more is that, many contestants are not tryin to be the Singapore Idol, but more of Singapore' s William Hung. Gay... In case you didn't know, William Hung is a joke. Americans think that WILLIAM HUNG = ASIAN. Therefore Asians = Joke. Fuck him. Hung made the world realised how fucked up asians can actually be, when in fact, asians are not. Yet, amazingly, many people wanna be like Hung. They wanna be a loser? How interesting. The stripper guy, the lemon tree singing faggot, and so on. Come on, these people are just bloody attention seekers, inspired by Hung, who is now relatively successful. However, i will never make a joke out of myself in front of national television. They're gay, while im not. Can't believe that they don't mind queueing up for days just for their TWO min of fame. Faggots. Don't they have some PRIDE or some shit?  If i happened to see those faggots, i'll definitely make fun out of them. Stupid retards. How stupid can these people can get? I also believe that Hung's success is somewad temporary and he'll soon be out of cash, but still a joke in the eyes of many people.       It's all his fault.              And this sucks

[except for the food and chicks] This place is boring and worse, its too strict. No chewing/ bubble gum, no oral/ anal sex, no illegal betting, dammit, it all sucks. Yet, many people here actually feel proud bout S'pore. Yeah, coz these majority are the ones that have been successfully brainwashed by the govt through the media  [National Day celebration]  education  [social studies]  etc. But waddaheck, life sucks anyway, everythin on this shit planet sucks. Durin the last hour or so, i have formulated this little quiz, called the SINGAPOREAN QUIZ. Take it to see how much a S'porean you are. Remember, this test is only valid for Singaporeans      Qn1.

Go JB   b. Go Batam   c. Go Europe      Qn7. Picture this. It's Chinese New Year and a dude gave you an empty red packet. What do you do?   a. Confront him and ask him for MORE money.   b. Tell your everyone bout it and call him a cheapskate   c. Nothing.      Qn8. Picture this. You are in a room full of people and you accidentally farted. What do you do?   a.

If you get:   15-20 points: Extreme hardcore Singaporean   10-14 points: Typical asshole Singaporean   5-9 points: Decent and acceptable   0-4 points: Rare existance in Singaporean society      National Day is just another day where the govt spreads propaganda and stuffs like that. But at the end of the day, it's YOUR money that is being sucked out of your pockets by these smart bitches. Bleah. Happy 39th National Day!

           Today was shitty. Went skatin at 4am, then got some fat fuck told us not to skate coz it was noisy [it was 5am then]. Bleah, that did not bother me, but what pissed me off was that a black bald nigga shouted from his window, "DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE BRAIN ISSIT? BASKET!" and then quickly went hiddin in his room. Bloody pussy. Felt like goin up to his house and ask him to repeat that in front of my face! I think pussies like these are the ones who should be culled. Bloody idiots. Come on dudes, we're humans, we can be reasoned out with. There's no need to shout from your fuckin window and hide like a bloody pussy. These type of idiots deserved to get their ass rip into two. Bleah, sometimes i think everyone should die.... Honestly though, the fat dude was kinda funny. He actually took the trouble to put on his clothes and come down, just to tell us not to skate. At least the bald black nigger was smarter, straight to the point....Bleah. Gonna sleep now. Had only 3 hours of sleep just now. Zzzz...

       As many of you know, i have a serious problem with punctuality. If i planned to meet someone at 3pm, it means that i'll be there at 4pm. But waddafuck. That's not the point.      Today (Tuesday) is the second day of the week that i am late for skool. Honestly speakin, it wasn't my fault that i was late. The fucked up bus came 10 min late. Statistically, this term alone, out of approximately 7 late comings, i managed to escape detention 5 times. In terms of percentage, i managed to escape detention bout 71.5% out of my total late comings. That's one bloody good record.      Out of my many historical escapes, today was the closest one to gettin busted. I was busted before and the consequences were really bad. ( Read ".....")  Okay, today was my another usual day of comin to skool late. I managed to sneak pass the prefect but since i'm a regular late comer, i guessed that the prefect's startin to figure out my dirty little tactics. At first, I was like YAY! but the son of a bitch Sydney Tan was makin people run around the track again ... (Read "Skool's Weird ") Bloody shithead. Then, while i was about to run aroound the track, i saw the prefect walkin towards My Sydney and they started talkin (prolly complainin bout me) , so i started to run faster, hopin to get away from him. Bleah, then after finished runnin around the track, i heard Mr Sydney Tan callin another dude, while the prefect was gone. He then accused the poor dude for runnin away from the prefect. Haha. Guessed that he scolded the wrong person. Then, i reacted instinctively by taking my bag and runnin back to class. Lol.

       Today, there was a talk about birthrates in my school. The speaker was an old dude who speaks with a funny accent. He said bla bla bla [can't recall, sleepin most of the time] Honestly speaking, i dont know waddafuck this got to do with social studies. Bleah. The speaker said somethin bout guys being biologically useless, coz with the so-called latest technology, the egg doesnt actually need the sperm to reproduce. I was like... waddafuck?  But after thinkin bout it for 2min 94 seconds, i came to a conclusion that guys = useless. Soon, we'll see all the people in the parliament being replaced by girls one by one, then they'll rule the world while we guys become their slaves. Bleah. Well, this is my opinion by the way, so all those  "tough guys"  who find this difficult to swallow, go fuck yourself. This is MY blog anyway.      Reasons why girls are better than guys:   -Can accuse someone of rape and people will  actually  believe you   -Can get free drinks on ladies night   -Can have multiple orgasms   -Can keep either short or long hair and still look good   -Can where pink without getting called a faggot   -Need not worry bout gettin caned when charged for something illegal   -Need not aim when it comes to pissing   -Need not be ashamed to be a housewife, but househusband? Eeee...   -Need not pay just to have sex, can just seduce them or sit in a bar till someone picks you up. (may not be applicable to VERY ugly girls)   -Need not worry bout size (boobjobs are easily available. currently, dickjobs dont exist yet)
