      (since this is the first time i'm writing one of these in here, i'd just like to make a note that if the title of my post is in quotes, i wrote it)  do you remember the night you told me you'd never met someone like me? it was so dark and cold but we were more than warm enough. throwing leaves in each other's hair and just laughing away our doubts  as well as the shock of who we were. somehow the combination of a breeze  and our arms was enough. it was just enough...  	maybe i made some promises in the past 	that i knew too well i couldn't keep 	so now i take them all back. 	i know i let you down 	but please don't let me go. 	there's no looking back now; it's too late. 	we're headed for tomorrow.  if i could say one thing to you to just make you stay it'd be how you're so different than anyone i know. oh you're so different but somehow we're so much the same.  this is the last time i want to  see you fold that letter and  put it away for safekeeping. if i bring you a match will you let me mark you  with the ashes we'll leave? i'll draw a heart on your sleeve then you'll be mine forever. you'll be mine...  we built those sandcastles on the shoreline. i thought they'd still be there. tell me why the tide  catches our heals so quickly. and i feel like i'm running but never get far enough. it's a lost cause. it catches us so quickly.  	maybe i made some promises in the past 	that i knew too well i couldn't keep 	so now i take them all back. 	i know i let you down 	but please don't let me go. 	don't look back now; it's too late. 	we're headed for tomorrow.*  it's a work in progress and since it's late, i'm simply posting here what is is as of now. perhaps i'll update it when i've completed it.

      *breathe in the precious summer air and the damp grass underneath your neck reminds you of those nights youd lay outside you look up and wonder why anything exists at all a question as old as human eyes*  i'm not sure where this came from but it wasn't mine. i give the credit to whoever wrote it. but i love it and it seems to suit my mood.  i've never wanted something so much yet been so inclined to be scared away before.  *lyric of the day*: "Make It Last"-The Ataris  There's a lot on my mind so I guess that  I'll take it one thing at a time. Still sometimes I can't help but wonder why I sit around all day and I waste my whole damn life away Still thinking about just what there is to say. Should I say goodnight Go to bed, turn out the fucking light And leave you shining in the past? Should I try and forget, Even though next week it's something I'll regret? Or should I try and make it last? I think about the day when I felt You'd throw it all away To try and make me feel like I'm the one. You were my best friend And I never ever thought those days would end. But now it seems like they are gone. What more can I say... I never wanted it to be this way. And where the hell is yesterday? We sure had a blast... I'm sorry that we're living in the past- Should we try and make it last?   That's all for now. ~*Fiore.
