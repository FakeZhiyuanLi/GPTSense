       We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life Run and tell the angels that everything's alright...    Yesterday was the usual liming day I guess, went to Stephen's.. played cards... played pool... but the highlight of my day was getting to be with Aleyya... the last time me n her were... together.. just me n her... was... hmm.. last week of the easter hols.. when we went to Marios n stuff... that was cool ... so yesterday was a lot of fun, she always makes me laugh... haha.. and we got some really good pictures to.. to add to my collection... when my burner decides to stop playing up.. I'd burn em and circulate em within the little social circle.. and I bought these REALLY cool hair ties.. ahaha..

Mom was sick yesterday, I didn't see her this morning so I don't know how she's feeling.. humm.. oh yeah I ate tons of chinese food yesterday, and since I AM allergic to that vetsin thing, my allergies went CRAZY last night... I was all sneezy and itchy... and that... together with being tired from romping during the day.... got me all bitchy .. =\.. sorry to the people I bitched at.. Oh well.. I don't do it often, it should be excused, thanks. For some strange reason I find myself listening to mushy music... and I'm sick.. it usually pisses me off.. *sigh*.. I was planning on studying today but I'm too sick to concentrate... "sometmes I wanna give up, wanna give in.. I wanna quit the fight.. and then I see you baby, and everything's alright.. everything's alright.. when I see you smile.. I can face the world... oh you know I can do anything... when i see you smile...

I think I should be resting.. or poisoning my mind with more... ugh.. bleh... These days I seriously analysing myself... cuz I realise there are parts of me.. that well I'm aware of.. but I don't know.. and I have no justification for being that way... so... I'm looking into all of that... Farewell, till we meet again...     Oderint dum metuant Let them hate provided that they fear

      So, confirmation eh?.. I was all.. contemplative in church today.. I realised for the million and sixth time how much I LOVE attending mass .. and how much I LOVE being Catholic... Religion intrigues me and I think Catholicism is fascinating.. I love it.. And I realised that I love something else.. My brother. He can be a stupid, ignorant, inconsiderate jackass when he wants to be, but he's kinda nice to be around... I almost cried when I saw him walking in today... :(.. shh.. thats a secret.. ok.. on to the good stuff.. KIMBERLY LOOKED SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Very soon, I shall have pics, tomorrow actually, but I'll hafta go to the cafe n scan em etc.. so until then I will not share my wealth, I will gape at her by myself... OOOO and Ryan Ali was there today also..... for a smallie... WOW... I won't mind taking a bite outta that cookie.... that devon biscuit.... and there was this other tallish fairish dude... helllloooo nice sando BOYS!.. I hafta go down there for mass one day.. just to gape... after I make my trip to Couva and my beloved Fr. Spence.. he was such a cool man, such a nice man to hug.... *sniff*.. I  miss my Fr. Spence... The Archbishop celebrated mass, it wasnt exactly what I expected, he was a bit boring, but I guess he had to say stuff in relation to confirming faith etc...     Recedite, plebes! Stand aside, little people!..

"Dawson, you've had a lifetime to process your feelings for me and i cant spend the rest of mine hoping you might throw a general glance in my direction in between your tortured teen romances with whatever Jen Lindley rolls into your life next"    "Dawson, you're not a little Oompa Loompa anymore. You're a big bad manly Oompa Loompa." -Pacey   "You don't understand, you don't get it. Those two words "Oompa Loompa" I hate those words. It's like every insecurity I have about myself exists inside those two words, all right? When you call me that, it's like you're exposing me. For not being Mr. Varsity Athlete, for not being sexually experienced. Look, I'm a virgin, okay? I'm not some big sex-stud like you." -Dawson    I am not William Wallace. But I am Pacey Witter. So they say. They say Pacey Witter is a dangerous man. A man who slaughters Capeside residents by the score... slaughters with jokes and buffoonery. And if he were here -- Heâ€™d destroy those who would judge him... with sparks from his eyes and wit from his arse. I am Pacey Witter. And I see a whole mob of fellow trailer trash here in shameful acceptance of false judgement and preconception. For who of you is in a position to judge? Is it you?! With your knock-off Brooks Brothers suit and those puzzling faux leather saddle shoes? Or is it you?! With that Edward Scissorhands hairdo and that... dead thing around  your neck? Who are you to judge me or mine? Who are any of you? And what kind of human tolerates being judged? Well, judgement stops today. That which scorns, deems to own me. And I am willing to trade the trappings of my dysfunctional life for one chance -- just one chance -- to stand up here in front of my fellow countrymen and tell my enemies... that you may take my life, but you will never take my freedom!!! -Pacey (Miss Windjammer Pageant)    "I haven't moved on, I haven't let go, And that is why I am linching on to the one thing I hold dear in my life." -Dawson Leery   "Faith that things will work out for the best. that whatever sent us off in different directions is the very same thing that will bring us back together." -Dawson   If people are truly, madly, deeply in love with eachother, they will find a way." -Dawson   "Joey, if we were truly meant to be, then will we find our way back to eachother." -Dawson   "Do you think every Joey has a Dawson and every Dawson has a Joey?" -Joey "hope so, for their sake." -Dawson   "I used to spend everyday thinking about you. When you walked by, I lost myself. Do you know what that's like?! To love someone so much but not have them love you back? You miss the way I looked at you. Well I don't miss the way you didn't look at me." -Henry   "You know you really love someone when you can spend the entire night just sitting by a fire watching them sleep." -Grams   " How could you simply be friends with someone when every time you look at them, all you think about is how much more you really want them?" -Dawson  "Well, you know, I'm no expert at this, Dawson, but I think it can be done." -Joey   You think because you were together, what she did to you hurts more? it doesn't. there's no difference, Pacey. she's sixteen. and so are you. We talk like we know what's going on, but we don't. We don't know anything, we're really young and we're gonna screw up a lot. we're gonna keep changing our minds and even sometimes our hearts. and through all that, the only real thing we can offer each other is forgiveness. i couldn't do that. or at least i did it too late. don't make my mistake. don't let yourself be so angry you stop loving. beacuse one day you will wake upfrom the anger and the person you love will be gone.

I bought a really really hot pair of shoes to wear to Michael's confirmation thing tomorrow... it's a bit high... I hope I can walk in it... hummm.. Once again I'm lamenting this Bravo shit... and the fact that Danah will be GONE.. from my life... with NO SORT OF COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER... for a WHOLE FRICKING MONTH... I hope I survive.. I honestly think I gonna lose a screw or something... gosh...

       I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day...  Take me to the place I love, take me all the way......    So... Today... saw Harry Potter and Garfield.. Globe, twice in one week, new record!!... Garfield was seriously... an "E".. (For you non-Harry Potter people, its "Exceeds Expectations")... I was expecting a crappy movie with a crappy computerized garfield... but it was actually funny... Odie was a dummy.. but Garfield's wisecracks were entertaining enough. Once more, that stupid Britney/Beyonce/Pink Pepsi commercial pissed me off to no end. The only good thing bout that is Enrique. Congrats to Portugal.. *clap clap*... I didn't see the game yet, so I can't say that they played well haha.. Although I have heard it from a lot of people... I'd look at the replay tonight :).. Plans for tomorrow are cancelled, no longer would my eyes be feasting on international school boys.. arrggghhhh feck man I need to talk to Danah and she's spending the night by bretts and fuego... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... ok .. Somebody who knows whats going on in my life?... It's time for one of you to come online now.. I need to vent to people who would actually know why I need to vent... which isnt large group... damn me for being so selective.. I... WANT... MY... DANUS... shit man... I'm still working on begging my mom to let me to go Bravo Bravo to see my beloved Krucifix... Kris said he'd come beg for me  also, so all you people reading this, say a little prayer... 2 little prayers... one praying for me to get to go... the other praying for me to be safe... So all in all, today was a good day, some parts erm... good-ER than others.. (*wink*)... i hope i can do it again some time .. (*WINK*).. but ahm get started earlier hahha... *bad stephie*... . Gym was ok, came home n played some cards with Riyad.... was TOLD by Dane that he'd carry Val and I for aus kreem, but left gym before yoga was done.. ok.. i'm going to go do something Val buffing me for whole evening. It smells good, leave me alone .. ;)... Hasta       Cogito, ergo doleo. I think, therefore I am depressed.

      So, it HAS finally come. The day that I'm bored enough to start up one of these things again. Will I continue this one?.. We'll have to wait and see... So today,  besides the little cinema lime, was one of the not-nicest days of my life. Why? Fecking ITALY got KICKED OUT... thats why.. Man, I don't remember if i ever cried for a football match before this Euro Cup... but I cried today.. and well i had tears in my eyes when sweden scored the goal against Italy that day.. hummm... oh well, i'll live.. i hope.. the cinema lime was cool, i saw people that i haven't seen in about a month or two... give or take a few weeks... nandi.. clay... shameer.. pete... everybody! was nice... and of course i got to see daniel radcliffe... and well the olsen twins, new york minute sucked, btw, i wont recommend it to anyone. there's just 2 hotttt dudes in it, as all olsen movies have. okay, i still thinking about italy...   this is NOT good.. not too sure what my plans are for tomorrow, most likely i'd go by auntie molly, play with andy... OMG.. andy started to walk.. and its the cutest thing.. he doesnt walk.. he waddles actually.. its soooooooooooooooooo sweet... and then he falls on his little bum and giggles... n u see his 4 little teeth.. when i have a son, i want my son to be just like him.. i've never heard him cry... and i'm at my aunt's a lot, just not recently cuz of exams.. he doesnt give trouble.. he's the perfect little baby... my andy..:).. Im still working on my mom ... to let me go to Bravo Bravo some night... dont remember exactly when.. to see rene n them play... exams are over.. i feel like a bum with no purpose... haha.. I should really be sleeping right about now, but I think that I'm becoming an Insomniac... (just like my kevvy!!) Okay, will add more later today... byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...     Veni, Vidi, Vici... I came, I saw, I conquered...

       Big Daddy      Tommy: How long have you delivered food to Mr. Koufax?    Nazo: I deliver food for six years. Plus, I'm stripper. But I've gained weight so that's a   problem.    Tommy: I see. And, in your experience, was Sonny a good father to Julian?    Nazo: Oh, yes. They make terrific pair. They went together like lamb and tuna fish.    Tommy: Lamb and tuna fish?    Nazo: Maybe you like spaghetti and meatball? You more comfortable with that analogy?    Homeless Guy: Yes, considering we're in America. I mean, if you don't like spaghetti and   meatballs, why don't you get the hell out?    Nazo: Listen, I'll come down there and give you a crew cut, Mister.    Homeless Guy: Let's see your clippers.    Nazo: Not my problem your father was sick.    Homeless Guy: That - well - -Stop yelling at me! AAAhhhhhhhh!         Cruel Intentions     Sebastian: Dear Annette, I don't know what I could possibly say that would rectify the harm I've caused you. The truth of the matter is that being with you was the only time I have ever been happy. My whole life has been a joke. I prided myself on taking joy in others' misery. Well, it finally backfired. I succeed in hurting the first person I ever loved. Enclosed is my most prized possession. My journal. For a long time I considered it my trophy. A sordid collection of my conquests. If you really want to know the truth than please read it. No more lies. Please give me another chance. I'm a wreck without you.      damn that emotion.. *sniff*...         How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days..     Andie: Does Princess Sophia want to come out and play?  Ben: Who's Princess Sophia?  [Andie points at his crotch]  Andie: Little, big, little, big... I don't know... we will find out!  Ben: You can't name my member... Princess Sophia.  Andie: Yes, I can!  Ben: If you are gonna name my... member, you have to name it something hyper masculine.   Something like Spike, or Butch, or Krull the Warrior King!        Andie: You can't lose something you never had.

Someone once told me that when they spend too much time with themself... that they get depressed... and its happening to me these days.. Due to my newfound Insomnia.... I'm awake at all hours of the morning, contemplating myself and life ... and it depresses me.. cuz when I start to think... I think about..... stuff... and him ... and stuff.. and him ... and I don't like that... For once in my life... I'm hardly going out.... Usually I would be in Chaguanas almost every day.... I went.. once last week.. twice the week before.. and I haven't gone since Thursday.... I duno.. I think that I'm losing all zeal for this thing called life... and right now I'm just dragging myself through the motions that I've grown accustomed to ... Nothing new.. Nothing fun.. Nothing spontaneous... I'm getting boring in my old age... haha... probably first and only amusing part in this entire post... Going to see the utter bullshit known as Spiderman 2 .. again.. tomorrow.. and Wednesday I may be going to the Wild Fowl Trust.. it all depends on how good my cousin behaves... according to my Aunt... bleh... I feel so not in the mood for anything fun right now.. then again.. its 2am... ffff... I think I gonna sleep... try to sleep off this thing.... Later Toads...

       Look into my eyes you'll see who I am...    My my, It has been a while, hasn't it?.. 6 Days ago... hmm.. On Monday... I went to Danah's house for bout an hour.. I stole a book.. well .. she told me to steal it.. 'Tis by Frank McCourt... I read the first book, Angela's Ashes... and loved it. I really recommend that book.. It's a true story bout an old, poor Irish family.. and how their father was a drunkard... and abandoned the family.. and the eldest son, Frank, had to work to support them.. anyhoo.. she left me on Tuesday morning, I got a txt from her at around 4 though... hmm.. I miss her... We chat online every day, most of the time twice for the day.. but its not the same... 24 days again... I'll live.. Tuesday.. I don't remember what I did on Tuesday... oh yes, I got up around 12, dad called at 12:45 and told me that I had lessons at 1.. for three hours... ugh.. so I barely had time to bathe properly.. but I did.. and I got there just 10 mins late.. I hate to reach late... but.. hmm.. So that was Tuesday... Wednesday... went tile hunting up Trincity.. took a spin in the mall and saw 2 tops that I want... (anybody willing to spend $300 on me, tell me) and after hmm... weeks and weeks of tile hunting I actually persuaded mom to buy this particular one .. its kinda nice... n yeah... that was my Wednesday.. Thursday.. went to the cinema avec Val, Jiggy, Shameer n Clayton... I honestly think Spiderman 2 was shit, however I am going to see it again, and maybe not focus on the million times he got unmasked.. and unmasked himself... and Doc. Ock's arms ... looked like snakes.. I hate that... grr... Friday... I did nothing... I think... nah I didn't do anything.. I can't remember if I really called Dad, or if I dreamt it.. but I think I called him.. asking him to take my by Auntie but he was in the cafe... and he said that he'd see.. (I still dont know if I dreamt this or not)... but I went back to sleep (if I even got up) .. and got up around 12 again... and ... STAYED UP ALL NIGHT!.. talking to Rene and Clayton.. Rene and I are BIG BLACK MEN with ENORMOUS piggies.. cuz we stayed up till 7:30!!.. and then I slept.. till... bout quarter past 1... ate... called dad again.. n asked him to take me somewhereeeeeee cuz I'm fed up of staying home... Sandy's leaving... sometime this week.. hmm.. I was supposed to go to the pool today but 1) I got up late 2) Mom was out all morning fixing something with the car n when she got back she was really tired.. So no pool this week... Last night I looked at this movie.. Khel.. it was actually really good... cept one thing that pissed me off was.. during every fight scene.. there HAD to be a pane of glass to throw someone through... even during the engagement ceremony thing.. there were pieces of coloured glass... that people were thrown through... I still love my indian movies though.... hehe.. Ok I'm off... curry duck calls...    Caeca Invidia Est..  Envy is blind...

      I seriously going off fellas now. Any advances in that direction from members of the opposite sex are going to be ignored. I will not put myself in a position where I could possibly feel this way again. Sorry. It's how I am right now. Out of the 2 boys in my life that I cared ... really cared about.... guess how many fucked me up?... 2.. hah. Big surprise. So as of now, this 17 year old is done with boys until she starts university. I have no problem with little flings here and there, but I will not allow myself to become emotionally attatched to any member of the opposite sex in the near, and hopefully far future. I hate to feel like this. It's like a cloud, casting a shadow, and hovering over me, following me wherever I go, ensuring that this shadow never leaves me. I like him a lot. I can even go as far as to say I love him. Yet he doesnt care. He would never see me the way I see him. Never. He was one of the only people that I ever let in, I trusted him, I broke down the walls that were maintained for 2 years... he was the cause... he was the reason... and now he has given me the same reason to rebuild those walls and never break them down again. I hate this. I hate him. I hate them. All of them. All freaking TWO of them. I am not completely over the first one, another surprise, and I don't think I will ever completely get over this one. So the memory of these two will carry me through my life. That's enough for me. You know what hurts the most. The fact that I held back, my fear of being hurt. I have come to believe that me holding back was a factor, although it may not be a significant one (who knows).. which would lead me to this ... Trying to protect myself eventually lead me to being hurt.. Ain't life grand. I miss him..... Goodbye...
