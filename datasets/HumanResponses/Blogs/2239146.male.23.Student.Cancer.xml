      This Blog will include prophetic words from many of the members of TAG (the awakening generation).  These words may cover a variety of topics & be addressed to a variety of audiences, from a word for the Church* in our area, to the Church of America.  (*Please note that by Church we refer to the body of Christ, being every person who has accepted Jesus as their saviour and in any way is pursuing a relationship with him).  We are called the Nameless & Faceless Generation because we strive to be those who will Give all the Glory to God our Father, and keep nothing for ourselves.  Our goal is to make greater His Fame and Glory.     Feel free to share the information you read here with other people as you desire.  We ask that, in accordance with copyright infringement laws, you give God the credit for whatever you find helpful & worthwhile here.  -God Speed-

      God is calling this Generation to not only be the Generation that steps into the promised land, but the Generation that restores the faith, the confidence, and the accountability into the office of the prophet.  Once again, those anointed by God to wear the mantel of the prophet will become sought after by elected officials for direction, guidance, and/or advice.  This Generation will hold itself accountable for the words they speak.  This Generation will step-up and confess any flesh that seeped into the words God gave them.  This Generation will restore the office of the prophetic.  It is this Generation that the prophetic  must  because it is  this  Generation that is lead the battle to retake land that has been held within the enemies grasps for so long.  But remember this Generation, remember that you must walk with your eyes looking towards heaven, towards God.  Remember this Generation, that you must remain as humble as Moses.  Remember this Generation, I have called you to be a uniting factor for all generations on this earth.  You cannot...you  will not  do this alone.   You require the wisdom that I will impart unto you, you require the wisdom of those whom I have placed around you.  Do not become complacent or prideful in what I have given you, for you will surely fall if you do.  Surrender yourself to Me and I will continue to build you up, I will continue to use you to speak My Word to this Nation, all Nations.  I am calling you to restore the faith in the prophetic, for it is this prophetic that will be integral to the battle that must be won on earth.

         There is coming a great movement of the Holy Spirit to the church.  There is a great outpouring coming from the heavens onto not only My church, but the whole world.  This outpouring of My Spirit is coming very suddenly and, unfortunately, a great number of My people will not prepared.  In fact some won't even think that this outpouring is of Me, this will cause an unexpected division many people will leave churches looking for something not as extreme, and that is what they will find. My children, do not focus on this division because it is because of My Spirit, yes MY SPIRIT, and after this seperation in the church there will be a massive increase.  You may even find that there will be even more numbers in the church than before.  The oncoming outpouring is about to bring a release to many in the church who are under bondages, and I am releasing the ministers of My Word to speak freely to the broken hearts, and I will heal them once again.  Do not focus on the division or the people who leave, but instead focus on Me, and prepare yourself so that you don't sit by idley and search for something without My Spirit.   Focus on Me only  and you'll only see the profit of and the good of this mighty movement.

      God is calling His children to wake up and shake off our Apathy-  ------  It is by My choosing, I tell you, that I allow you, My children, to choose.  You may choose Me, or not.  Once you have chosen Me, you set the pace.  It is you who decides how quickly you grow in Me.  I do not force myself upon you.  I woo you.  I call to you because I long to be with you.  Can't you see that all you have to do is ask?  I'll give Myself you- up to the amount that you desire.  I am not angry with you, my children.  This is a lie of the enemy.  I have always wanted you.  Ask for Me, I'm so glad to give myself to you.  ------  The Lord is willing to reveal himself.  "Ask and you'll receive." When you earnestly seek, He pours himself out.  He is saying to us--  These are serious times.  You cannot afford to wait until later to grow in me.  Come now and you will find what you seek.  I am preparing to pour out wisdom, maturity, and my gifts upon those who desire Me.  Live as though the tomorrow that You will see will be the last- because you don't know!  My signs, wonders and miracles will be poured out through the seekers, and many will wonder.  Many will be afraid.  Many will turn.  But there will be multitudes that will come and believe.  And those who labor now are building my bridge- that which will be made from the hard work and labor of my children will act as a pass for those new workers to come across and into deep intimacy with Me at much greater ease than those who built for years.  In this, I say, REJOICE!  For the Kingdom of God is for all who come.  Your reward is me, you laborers.  Do not turn your eyes from Me and your brothers in these times.  I am your sufficiency. ---  pray for & prefer one another.  Lift each other up. because God is Love.  amen.

      The church named University Praise in Fullerton is entering interesting times.  They've entered a new series titles "The Apprentice: Learning to Live Our Lives as Jesus Would."  When they first described it, it was just past Easter.  They mentioned how in many of our lives, God's power is not manifest.  I can't remember exactly what they said, but I remember my internal paraphrase: they want to move from a Christ's death focus to a Christ's resurrection focus.  This is an important point, so I’ll describe.  Christ’s death dealt with our sins.  It killed the disease that kills us.  But it’s his resurrection that’s even greater.  That’s because we are brought to life with him.  It’s fine for the disease to be dead.  But without new life, how are we better off?  We’re still dead.  They want to grab hold of this new life.  That’s exciting.  Now, I’ve gotten in the habit of showing up early to the second service, and spending ten to fifteen minutes interceding for the church.  As a part of this, I’ve had a repeat “vision” of an earthquake.  I can feel the tremor in the ground.  And God shows me the significance.  An earthquake is an unsettling.  And if God’s behind it, the original settling wasn’t good.  One of the first times I felt this, what God had me pray was that this earthquake would make the topography of the church unrecognizable.  It’s a big order.  Fortunately, God’s bigger.  My intercession reveals interesting stuff (well, to me).  This last week, they were teaching about the ways Jesus taught (the last bit of background before they go into the Sermon on the Mount).  At the end, the pastor mentioned that this teaching was intended to change us, that we need to respond.  He said more, but I didn’t catch it because I was instantly interceding.  You know how sometimes there are moments in your life that define how everything will be?  This was one for that church, and many people in it.  It was a moment when they had to decide to agree with God’s work, or to turn aside.  It was intense.  My prayer language is naturally fast-paced, and there was to much need and intensity that I was trying to make it faster.  Well, after that, we had communion and sang a couple more worship songs.  Here’s the best part.  During one of these songs, there was an addition to the vision.  Down the middle of the church, between my feet, there formed a crack.  It was supplemented with another vision.  When I was disappointed with Campus Crusade for Christ’s “I Agree with Lisa” campaign, God showed me the true accomplishment of the campaign.  There was a surface, and a small crack.  A hand placed a wedge against the crack, then tapped it into place with a hammer.  Then, the hand with the hammer wound back.  That was our campaign.  Well, during this church service, I saw that vision again, and the hammer struck its first blow.  So, things are beginning in that fellowship, and I suspect, in all of Southern California.  Please, everyone, be in prayer for this church, and God’s movement down here.

           what i feel the Lord is wanting from his children at this time is a far greater unity.  a unity like this world has never seen before.  What He is releasing is not something that this nation has not really seen before, this is not a unity that can be broken as long as we all walk in humility.  here humility is key!  one thing that the Lord is bringing out of His children is a true serving quality. i feel like He is saying, "just as I came to the earth as a servant, so should all my children opperate in the same humility.  Becuase when I come again to the earth I will be seen as a King, a King of supreme Glory, and on that day all My children who walked the same humility in thier life, as I always have in mine, will be revealed as the kings that they are.  I am the King of kings and I am the Lord of lords, My name will be known throughout the entire universe as that once again, My name is about to be revealed in it's Glory once again to many of My people who have strayed away or stumbled on the path.  amen once again."      I feel like this is really something we as the church of america should approach with all the praises of our hearts.  He is releasing a movement through the Holy Spirit like we have never seen before, AMEN!!!!!!  Pray and intercede over this prophecy so it may come to pass onehundred fold as we expect.    PRAISE THE LORD!!!!

           It's time to let go.  Now is the time to recognize the things that have been holding you back, and some things that you won't want to let go of, but they are holding you back.  Now is the time that the Lord is going to be doing some "house-cleaning" in His body so he can bring us all to new level.  There are a few things we have to know first before He can take us to this new hieght.     One: That the Lord is above all things and His beauty and perfection is far more majestic then even the most beautiful thing we could ever see or try to fathom while here in this world.  He and His ways are completely without flaw no matter how strange or uncomfortable it may seem to us, some things that He does may seem hard or even like they aren't helping us at all, this is because this world clouds our view. What we see is corupted by the wicked ways of man, and by praying with a pure heart and intention we surrender our eyes and  mind  to God and His will...     ...so pray    Two:  God's ways are sparked by love.  Any move that God has ever done was out of love first, even through punishment He shows us all of His love, He punishes us because He loves us.  It's like a small fat kid getting caught while sneaking a cookie from the jar.  He will be punished by his parents because they love him and don't want him to spoil his dinner.  And because he is fat and doesn't need to become anymore fat.  WE ARE THAT FAT KID!!!!!!  The church is always trying to reach our greedy little hands into the cookie jar and get something that will only last a moment, but in reality we are just spoiling our dinner.  His people, much to often, turn to the world looking for something sweet and scrumcious to curb their desires, when in actuality we are only filling up on the wrong things.  Cookies are good but they aren't very healthy now are they?  But if we His people who were called by His name turned to him and asked Him for dinner we would get something that would not only curb our hunger, but it would fill us up much longer than anything that the world would ever be able to offer us.  We need to turn from the world to God and ask for our dinner:  His love, gifts and an awesome relationship, and the main dish the Holy Spirit who is God...      ...so pray    Three:  It's about time that we need to stop saying that we have faith and start proving it.  The Lord was speaking to me a few days ago and this is a summary of what he said, "WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING!?!?!?!?".....was that too vague?  Okay, supposedly there are around, eh, thirteen million people who say that they are christians.  Now I'm sure that number is much smaller in actuality but for now let's just go with that.  Ok "thirteen million" christians on the planet right now, so why dosen't it seem like it?  I'll tell you why because we aren't sharing our knowlege of the truth with anyone.  If there were only ten thousand actual loving christians on this planet, and each of them shared the name of Jesus with, like, twenty people that God gave us everyday with all the love, compassion, and grace we had and only three people (that's three for every single christian of the ten thousand christians we began with) accepted Jesus as their Lord and savior then thirty thousand people would be saved everyday.  That's 30,000 people everyday, and if each of those christians, new and old, saved three more people everyday then in one year around 328,510,950,000 people would be saved (give or take a million or two), now remember that is if there were only ten thousand christians on the face of this planet.  There are millions of us!!!!  OK let's take a step back, our number of christians in one year is threehundred and twenty-eight billion fivehundred and ten million-nine-hundred-and-fifty-thousand.  Then funny thing is there are only around six billion people on the face of this plant so the world would be save fiftyfourbillion-seven-hundred-and-fifty-one-million-eighthundred-and-twentyfive-thousand (54,751,825,000) time over.  And remember this I'm only calculating ten thousand christians, not thirteen million!!!  What are we so afraid of?  Let's look at the worst thing that could happen, we are killed, martyred for Christ.  Sounds pretty cool to me, if I have to die I think it should be while I'm doing something for Jesus, that's the way I want to go.  Ok... sorry where was I...oh yes, we are martyred for Christ, were are we going?  That's right to heaven and we will be rewarded by God for our commendable deeds.  Now I'm not saying that to go out and get yourself killed while you are sharing the gospel.  No, no, no quite the opposite, what I am saying is go out and let God use you, no matter what it takes and don't let fear have it's way, fear not for the power in you (christians) is greater than the power that is in them (therest of the world)!       ....So like I was saying God loves you and wants you to step off of the boat onto the crashing waves and let Him use you!!!!     ....so don't hold Him back from using you        and that is how we can hopefully speed up the process in    which He takes us to new levels: casting out our "wieght" or "roadblocks," praying, turning to He who created us and asking for something better, and stepping out in faith.  Warning:  The young person who prophesied this prophsy is very bad at math, but do not worry for he used the calculator on the computer. God Bless!!!!!!!

                Not On My   Watch          1 Timothy 4  Instructions to Timothy   "1The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons."  A warning word has come forth in the past week, and that is the enemies camp there is unrest and a new attack on the body has been launched.God spoke the word to me in a dream, "Seducing Spirits."  In the dreams were the leaders of the body and how the enemy is trying to infiltrate the front line.  There is now a group of us now interceding for those leaders on the front line. It is no surprise to me that the enemy will try a stunt like this, but my friend, it will be to no avail!!!  Why??? Because there is a stirring, a Holy Stirring that Only God could have started.  So, pray for the front line leaders of the body, pray God's covering, protection and wisdom and discernment in these last days!!!   --Alex

      God, long ago, you agreed with Abraham: if ten righteous men could be found in Sodom and Gomorrah, then you would spare the cities. They weren't found, and the cities were destroyed. Now, I bargain with you again. If ten people who attend Cal-State Fullerton are hungry for you, just ten, will you send revival? I beg this of you God, as I present my ten: Jessica, Eleanor, Felix, AJ, Aaron, Andrew, Clay, Sean, Derek, and myself. Those are the ten hungry ones. Lord God, bring your revival to my school!

I am coming to you in power and in might in these last days.  The smell of latter rain. The smell of the new anointing is almost here. Be prepared! I have formed you, I have fashioned YOU for this very hour, to take in and to give what you have received.   Do Not hold back! Do Not hold back!  Call out to me with a loud voice, with a great shout, Declare this day that, 'I am your God.'  God is calling us,  Come closer to me Come closer to me Do not hold back Do not hold back Come closer Listen for my voice, See what I am doing.  The shower of blessings are here... Look Listen Smell I am preparing to rain - reign on the earth once again. To reign with a new power. a new authority in you my people.  Come forth Taste and see that I AM GOOD. Take and give Take and give. Do not be afraid, for I have prepared a way where there seems to be no way.  ASK of me and I WILL show you great and mighty things which you knowest not! ( you don't even know ).  Everything is in place - come to me now with an attitude of expectancy."

        I believe that the Lord is releasing a new zeal upon His people.  He is recreating the hearts of many, many of which who have usually sat in the back row will be in the front calling out to God.  With this new desire things will begin to become easier for the Church.  If we come together in unity then we are unstoppable, but if we segregate we a weak.  The Church is like a school of fish, together we are one big body, but if we drift from eachother we are left vulnerable to the attacks of the ever-lurking sharks.    It's time for us to stand together and simply love, the Bible says the world will know that we are Christians by our love, because our love is Love.  I can see the day, everything seems so easy.  There is one way, one path, one outcome the problem is finding it.  Through obedience to God everything is a breeze, and this present darkness that we live won't seem so dark anymore.  Changing our focus we need to turn towards God, and away from the death that we escaped from once before.  Jesus said that He only does what He sees the Father doing, He also said that we would do greater things the He(John 14:12), there is a key to all of this: listening, waiting, expectancy/faith and obedience.  God will show us what He wants us to do, and He will always come through Deuteronomy 31:8 says:    "The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you.  Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."  As long as you see God doing something then you know for sure that He will not leave you alone, because it was His idea in the first place and He won't step back on His own ideas, no, instead He will send to you the Holy Spirit who is The Counselor, The Helper, The Promise,and The very Spirit that makes us one; at the request of Jesus, and He will perform miracles through you(John 14:16-18, John 14:26-27).  There is one thing that can stop us, and it's not the devil, who is our accuser, it is ourselves.  It is the fear   we   allow to scare us, it is when   we   turn   our   eyes and ears away from God, and it is when   we   deny the words of our Father.  We are our worst enemy, not the devil, he can't force us into anything it is us that yields to his lies.  NO MORE!!!  It could be so easy for us all we have to do is obey, all we have to do is live like the godly children that we are(1 Peter 1:14-16).         "Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of His wonderful acts.         Glory in His Holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the       Lord rejoice."                          ~1 Chronicles 16:9,10                                                                                ~ciao
