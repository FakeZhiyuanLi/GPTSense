      Future: First World, Fourth World | guy berger  • 2002-04-05 10:56    urlLink Future News: First World, Fourth World .   The future of news hinges upon the future of journalism. And where you are in the world makes a big difference to your futurizing about news.  One of the big contextual issues facing First World journalists is what Peter Dahlgren calls the decline of the "modernist model of journalism". He argues that advanced competition, commercialization and new technologies are threatening the classic (and romanticized) image of journalism with extinction. Instead of the journalist as crusading Superman pursuing truth and justice, we have Fellini's commercialized Paparazzo operating at what Bill Kovach calls warp-speed.   In this view, journalism morphs into non-journalism, and the little that remains has to compete with entertainment and advertising. In addition, it's argued that information sharing in cyberspace bypasses the classic info-mediary role of professional journalism. In short, Dahlgren warns that journalism is in danger of losing its rationale.   The response to such pessimism is to work vigorously for preserving the democratic and informational importance of journalism, and for connecting it back to communities. The call is also for journalists to survive by growing their role as guides and interpreters in a media terrain that is ever more overcrowded with messages and meanings.  So, the future of news in the First World therefore will be a function of how successfully these strategies can be pursued.   Back in Africa, in what Manuel Castells calls the Fourth World, the future of news is rather different. Here, the "modernist model of journalism" is under threat from somewhat different forces. Instead of Superman, we have the journalist as Terminator. This is communicators crafting news as "patriotic" apologies for failed African governments like Zimbabwe, or producing propaganda for genocide as in the case of Rwanda.   Far from being a threat to independent journalism, commercial and technological factors in the Fourth World can help develop it. Producing a portion of news as a commodity for sale, means the product has to be credible enough for purchase. That's not a bad thing in the context. Except for one condition: unless there are also non-commercial (but politically independent) mechanisms to serve the strata of "information poor" of the Fourth World, news for them will simply remain out of reach. The market can liberalise Fourth World news production, but on its own it won't serve the wider societies. The future of news in the Fourth World requires successful struggles for media freedom and independence as well as true public service.   So, although for different reasons, classic news is under threat in both First and Fourth Worlds. The same applies in varying mixes to the worlds in between. The outcomes depend on successful strategies ... and on adopting a holistic approach that links the two poles. First World news needs to incorporate news about the rest of us - even if not always commercially popular - if First Worlders are to understand the impact of the world beyond Washington DC. The annual Highway Africa conference in South Africa () is precisely about developing the Fourth World's information riches that have so much to contribute to global knowledge and information.   At the same time, Fourth World journalists need the First World solidarity that grows out of coverage of their struggles. There is also much that Fourth Worlders can learn from First World democratic, economic and technological experience.  Amongst the diverse media with prospects for advancing news on a global basis, it is the Internet lends itself to journalism that can link most successfully across the international divides. Who pays and how is still an unsettled matter. Whatever models emerge, the future of news in an uneven world will be profoundly influenced by them.   References: Berger, G. 1999.

       urlLink Olle Wästbergs hemsida - The Home page of Olle Wastberg : "Hur ska tidningarna hantera det nya mediesamhället? Bakom krisen på New York Times ligger ocks diametralt olika uppfattningar om hur en tidning ska göras i det nya mediesamhälle som levererar nyheter blixtsnabbt på internet eller genom direkts�ndning med digitala kameror och mobiltelefoner.   Howell Raines företrädare, Joseph Lelyveld (som nu återkommer som tillfällig chefredaktör) hade ett svar: Tidningarna kan inte konkurrera om nyheter, men kan vara bäst på analyser, bakgrunder och fördjupningar. New York Times organiserades under Joe Lelyveld efter detta: Journalister arbetade i team och fick hålla på länge med samma uppgift.   Howell Raines hade han en helt annat svar: Han menade att New York Times genom sina stora resurser skulle kunna ta tag i nyhetshändelser bättre än någon annan. Därför lösgjordes journalister från fasta arbetsuppgifter för att kunna sättas in på dagens story. Den metoden firade triumfer kring den 11 september, men gav inte samma genomslag i det dagliga nyhetsarbetet.   Raines slutord till redaktionen när han avgått var: 'Remember, when a great story breaks, go like hell.' Han fick inga applåder. "

       urlLink Poynter Online - Ethics Codes from Around the World : "Ethics Codes from Around the World  By Sree Sreenivasan Columbia Professor & Poynter Visiting Professor     Now that the New York Times has released its revised ethics code ( urlLink New York Times Ethics Policy PDF ), I thought it might be useful to find a site that lists ethics codes for journalists from around the world.  The site I found that does this best is England's urlLink  PressWise  Trust, which has an archive of more than 100 journalists' codes in its ethics section. PressWise, which is based in Bristol, is a self-described 'media ethics charity' and works to improve the standards of U.K. journalism.  The ethics section can be used in two ways. On the main page is a collection of codes divided by country (from Albania to the United States), along with the codes of international organizations and some U.S. newspapers (though not yet the NYT's). On the right-hand column, you can see excerpts of various codes on selected topics, including accuracy, bribery, copyright, minorities, and women. Comparing the codes of each country is quite educational. (One tweak the site needs: I would put the date each code was revised right up top.)  In the meantime, back in the U.S., to keep track of ethics goings-on, you should bookmark the  urlLink ethics section  of the Poynter site and Bob Steele's  urlLink 'Talk About Ethics'  items."

       urlLink Poynter Online - Convergence Chaser : "Uber-journalists in the making? The world of converged media may never birth a well-coiffed reporter who can turn a package on deadline, file to the web with pictures from a photo-phone, then rewrite the piece for print with a killer lead. But in converged markets of Richmond, Va.-based Media General, news managers think they can at least train young reporters to think about how to tell better stories using the power of TV, print and the Web. In the Virginia market that includes WSLS Newschannel 10 in Roanoke, The (Lynchburg) News & Advance and Danville Register & Bee, editors wanted to put an emphasis on recruiting journalists with an understanding of multimedia. But where do you find them?  The discussion evolved into plans for an internship program, beginning in 2004, that puts postgraduates in the TV studio, in the print newsroom and with the Web staff for nine months, rotating through all divisions and contributing to nearly every cross-platform project that comes out of the chute. It's already proved a learning process, but not for the potential interns. As the first applications come in, print and online editors are learning what to look for in a resume tape. Newspaper and TV editors want to know what you look for on the Web (a little HTML couldn't hurt). Editors from all three platforms will be interviewing candidates and making the hiring decision together. While they don't expect candidates to be well-versed in all three platforms, they'll be looking for training on at least two and a willingness to break ground. In addition to work experience, the intern will participate in the properties' existing training programs, which include everything from technical skills to convergence ideology.  There are some lessons here for other news managers as they start the hiring process for next summer's interns. How will you train young reporters to think about how to tell better stories using TV, print and the Web?  How will you get managers from all media platforms involved in the hiring decision?

      Here is the new report on the state of the American media 2004.  There are a lot of interesting things here, some specificaly american, some are of more general application.      urlLink Overview: Introduction :   Glance at some items in the news of late and it seems that many long-held ideas about journalism are unraveling.  President George Bush told ABC's Diane Sawyer in December that he preferred to get his news not from journalists but from people he trusted, who "give me the actual news" and "don't editorialize." After spending time at the White House, the New Yorker writer Ken Auletta concluded that senior staff members there saw the news media as just another special interest group whose agenda was making money, not serving the public - and surveys suggest increasingly that the public agrees.  Some argue that as people move online, the notion of news consumers is giving way to something called "pro-sumers," in which citizens simultaneously function as consumers, editors and producers of a new kind of news in which journalistic accounts are but one element.  With audiences now fragmented across hundreds of outlets with varying standards and agendas, others say the notions of a common public understanding, a common language and a common public square are disappearing.  For some, these are all healthy signals of the end of oligarchical control over news. For others, these are harbingers of chaos, of unchecked spin and innuendo replacing the role of journalists as gatekeepers over what is fact, what is false and what is propaganda. Whichever view one prefers, it seems everything is changing.  Or is it?  This study, the first in what is to be an annual report on the state of the news media in America, is an attempt to answer this question, to take stock each year of the state and health of American journalism.  The answer we arrive at in 2004 is that journalism is in the midst of an epochal transformation, as momentous probably as the invention of the telegraph or television.  Journalism, however, is not becoming irrelevant. It is becoming more complex. We are witnessing conflicting trends of fragmentation and convergence simultaneously, and they sometimes lead in opposite directions.  While audiences are fragmenting, we have greater capacity than ever to come together as a nation in an instant - for September 11, the Super Bowl or watching soldiers live on the battlefield in Iraq. While Americans are turning to more and varied sources for news, the media that they are relying on increasingly tend to be owned by a few giant conglomerates competing to cover what seem to be at any moment a handful of major stories.  Quality news and information are more available than ever before, but in greater amounts so are the trivial, the one-sided and the false. Some people will likely become better informed than they once could have been as they drill down to original sources. Other consumers may become steeped in the sensational and diverting. Still others may move toward an older form of media consumption - a journalism of affirmation - in which they seek news largely to confirm their preconceived view of the world.  The journalists' role as intermediary, editor, verifier and synthesizer is weakening, and citizens do have more power to be proactive with the news. But most people will likely do so only episodically. And the proliferation of the false and misleading makes the demand for the journalist as referee, watchdog and interpreter all the greater.  These conflicting movements toward fragmentation and convergence are not new to the culture in general or media in particular, but they have different consequences when they come to news. Journalism is how people learn about the world beyond their direct experiences. As our journalism fragments, it has consequences for what we know, how we are connected and our ability to solve problems.

              plagiarism, rewriting and ethics     urlLink          I have been thinking a lot about  urlLink plagiarism , rewriting and  urlLink ethics  over the past month or so.       Partly because I heard a couple of radio pieces on  urlLink Swedish radio   which comprised of content lifted from the  urlLink New York Review of Books  (nyrb) - and if fact attributed to them, though very briefly at the end, and had read a column in one of the evening papers that was lifted verbatim from the  urlLink Weekend Financial Times  with no attribution whatsoever.     But also because of the discussion, or to be more precise the lack of discussion, about accusations of plagiarism made against  urlLink Dagens Nyheter ´s Peter Borgström.      In an article in  urlLink Stockholm Spectator  it is convincingly shown [ urlLink SEE THE EVIDENCE ] that Borgström´s article  " urlLink Hiphoppen rumsren "  was  taken from the New York Times article   "Sweeten the Image, Hold the Bling-Bling,". The "borrowing" was admitted to by DN´s culture editor;            And thanks for pointing out Peter Borgström's article. I have since been in touch with him and he admits that the article was built on the one you cited from the  New York Times.  He regrets that he neglected to mention the source.                    Dagens Nyheter's policy is clear on this point: the source should, of course, be stated if material is taken directly from another newspaper. Unfortunately violations of this rule are quite commonplace in the press; often because of lack of time, negligence or pure forgetfulness. I have no reason to doubt that the lack of references to the source was purely a mistake. Peter Borgström is well aware of our policy and I am convinced that it will not happen again. Kind regards, Lars Linder         What caught my attention was the line:        Unfortunately violations of this rule are quite commonplace in the press;             I agree! The violations are commonplace and it is unfortunate - to say the least. But there was some comfort in the fact that Linder was aware of the mistake and Borgström was aware of the policy. Awareness is a wonderful thing.  That got me thinking about what we teach our students about the ethics of rewriting. Then came the follow-up.  It seems that several of Bergströms articles were "borrowed" and that he seemed less aware of the policy than first believed. Even more problematic was the lack of awareness shown by Linder. When made aware of several more examples of non-creative rewriting (being kind here) his response was to see this as a personal attack on his reporter (and in effect on him as an editor).             Mr. Moynihan,        I don't really understand your great interest in Peter Borgström's articles in  Dagens Nyheter . Nor do I deem it necessary to examine further some general findings of detective work that, for unclear reasons, is being directed towards individual employees. In other words, I don't want anything to do  (ta del av)  with loosely founded accusations when it comes to such serious matters.        But if you, or other readers, have well-founded accusations of this kind against articles published by us, I, of course, would like to be made aware of them.         Kind regards, Lars Linder    This raises a number of important points       What are the ethical boundaries for rewriting as accepted by the Swedish media?     What help do we give our students to see the problem and deal with it?     Why is there such a tendency to close ranks in the Swedish media when criticism is leveled against it?    Interestingly there is no mention of plagiarism in the discussion document on ethics from the Swedish Union of  journalists.   urlLink Nytt etisktregelverkför medierna?- diskussionsunderlag från Journalistförbundets etikutredning   I will get back to this.

       urlLink Stockholm Spectator  V: THE EVIDENCE   Example One: "Hiphoppen rumsren"  The following article—a short piece on the mainstreaming of hip-hop culture—was the first of Peter Borgström’s dispatches to arouse our suspicions. It was Media Watch's email inquiry regarding "Hipphoppen rumsren" (reprinted above) that provoked a fleeting—and ultimately unenlightening—correspondence with Dagens Nyheter's culture editor Lars Linder.  Like many of Borgström's articles, "Hiphoppen rumsren" is a chaotically reconstituted version of a much longer New York Times report, stripped of its original nuance and byline.  The Times piece, written by culture correspondent Lola Ogunnaike, was published on January 12, 2004. Peter Borgström filed his translated (and truncated) version three days later. Dagens Nyheter’s adaptation was printed without a reference to Ogunnaike's original report or the New York Times.  In all of the following examples, the Times originals are listed first (in black), with Borgström's versions below (in red). For those interested, English translations (of Peter Borgström's translations) are forthcoming, though the Times originals are usually sufficient. In most cases, they are nearly identical.     * "On the song 21 Questions he even plays up his tender side. 'I love you like a fat kid loves cake,'..."       "Rapparen 50 Cent skaldar numera ömsint: "Jag älskar dig som en fet unge gillar kakor"  (Media Watch Note: Borgström offers an accurate translation of the Times story: "tender" is rendered literally as "ömsint")     * "Missy Elliott, on her single Wake Up, raps: "If you don't got a gun, it's all right."       "Missy Elliott sjunger i sin tur att det är okej att vara obeväpnad."  * "'Ja Rule is probably being purchased more in a mall in Virginia than on 125th Street,' [Nelson] George, the author [of Hip-Hop America], said."  "Hiphoppens kärnpublik må finnas i stadsgettona, men det är inte på 125:e gatan i Manhattans Harlem merparten av skivköparna finns."       (Media Watch Note: Here Borgström passes off a quote from Nelson George, author of "Hip Hop America," as his own)  * "Murder Inc. (now simply called The Inc.) is not the first label to rechristen itself. Death Row, the West Coast outfit that made gangster rap a multimillion-selling commodity throughout the early- to mid-1990s, changed its name to Tha Row..."       "Skivbolagen snyggar upp sina namn. Av 'Murder Inc' blev det 'The Inc', av 'Death Row' blev det 'Tha Row'."  * "Andre 3000, the avant-garde half of Outkast, now favors seersucker pants, saddle shoes and Brooks Brothers blazers. Big Boi, the hardcore half of the duo, is now partial to 1970s-inspired tuxedos"       "Till exempel klär sig André 3000 70-talsaktigt i byxor av kräppad bomull"  (Media Watch Note: This is a confused bit of plagiarism. As the Times notes, it is Outkast member 'Big Boi' that "is partial" to the "1970's-inspired" wardrobe, while "Andre 3000" affects a 1950's country club look. Borgström has it backwards.)     * "50 Cent...is rarely seen without a snug-fitting tank top."       "...50 Cent i metrosexuell tanktop..."  (Media Watch Note: In a pitiful attempt to Swedify an overused hipster colloquialism, Borgström claims that 50-Cent often wears a “metrosexual tank top.” For those blissfully unaware, "metrosexual" is the ubiquitous, media-coined slang term describing a heterosexual male with the lifestyle instincts of a homosexual male. It's flatly absurd to suggest that the menacing rapper is in anyway "metrosexual," simply for flaunting his overdeveloped upper torso. In fact, Mr. 'Cent', in a fit of sub-literate candor, recently told Playboy Magazine that he "ain't into faggots. I don't like gay people around me, because I'm not comfortable with what their thoughts are.")     * "Some, such as Nas and Ja Rule, have scaled back on the bling."       "Nas och Ja Rule har skippat "blinget"  * "Jay-Z...says: 'I don't wear jerseys/I'm 30 plus/gimme a crisp pair of jeans' and 'button-ups.' Button-up is slang for an oxford shirt."       "Jay-Z föredrar nytvättade jeans och oxfordskjorta framför träningsoverall."     * "Wal-Mart won't stock your album if you're too gangster."       "Men varuhuskedjor som Wal-Mart vägrar sälja skivorna om de finner texterna anstötliga"     * "...rappers are now hawking everything from soft drinks to deodorant..."       "...vill man också dra fördelar av kändisskapet med reklamkontrakt för deodoranter och läskedrycker..."  * "And 50 Cent saves his raunchier, more belligerent rhymes for mixtapes -- sold on street corners and in specialty stores -- releasing more restrained, radio-friendly singles for mass consumption."  "Texternas våldsförhärligande må ha trappats ned och blivit radiovänligt. De ocensurerade versionerna, det vill säga de som inte är avsedda för masskonsumtion, kan köpas av gatuförsäljare och i specialbutiker"    Sources: Lola Ogunnaike, "Sweeten the Image, Hold the Bling-Bling,"  New York Times, January 11, 2004 Peter Borgström, "Hiphoppen rumsren," Dagens Nyheter, January 15, 2004
