      An Absent Tuesday....  He left home at the usual time; just as he does five days a week. It was Tuesday morning. The big merger was to be initiated today. A bonus was guaranteed and the family swimming pool could be installed by March of the following year.  Tuesday morning never ended.  The big merger never happened.  The bonus never came.  The swimming pool never materialized.  And he never came home.  She kissed her two sons goodbye before leaving for work; just as she had always done during the week. They waved through the living room window as she drove away. Today was the day she was to be promoted. Life would be easier for the single working mother from this point on. Today was Tuesday and it was to be her day of dedication.  Two sons have lived two years longer than their mother.  They sometimes wait for hours at the living room for her to return.  The promotion never came to pass.  Life has been anything but easier since that fateful Tuesday morning.  The 11th day of September.  His wake-up alarm went off as set. The boots shined in the first hint of dawn while the uniform waited to be filled as it hung empty nearby. The hat with the number 17 stared back at him as he rose to start his first day on the job. Red had always been his favorite color and today he would see it in more than one way on more than one face.  Another alarm sounded just before 9 AM.  The uniform protected him just as it had been designed to do.  The hat with the number 17 was found -- seven days later.  It was fated to be his first and last day as a Firefighter.  His hometown became his burial place -- New York City.  There are names we can remember. Faces we cannot forget. Stories we could never tell with a dry eye. Moments we have yet to imagine as being factual. Images that we can only hope are never seen again.  Tuesday morning, two years ago, has never ended.  The names shall not fade away.  The faces are there in the faces of the living.  The stories are trapped in time but not in despair.  Ghosts of the final moments walk within the city streets.  Wounds that must be healed with pride and devotion to hope.  There is but one September 11th every year.  Let us pray that the one we remember most is the last of our generation.  ~~~~~~  For those who never came home, who never saw the faces of their children again or never awoke to see the new day afterwards, I, as an American, shall not soon forget their courage, their plight to survive and their hopes to endure the American Dream void of the nightmares we must overcome in the space between day and night and sometimes, the hour between life and death.  We will be united.... again.  G. ~

      I hated gym class. Not because of what was involved. It was what came afterwards.  I have always been self-conscience about my looks. Even now, at the ripe age of 35, I still find myself intimidated by an attractive guy. A cute guy even makes me feel nervous if I'm alone with him for too long. That's not to say that as a friend he would make me nervous but as a stranger -- yeah, it might feel awkward at first.  Now imagine undressing in front of this person when you're 14 or 15 and in the ninth grade while standing around a room full of others. Naked.  I was never what you might call "athletic". I don't have muscles that stand out when you first see me. I was never a jock. Never even dated one. I was always the last guy picked for baseball, basketball, football; even the last one picked during the annual school sack race.  I wore glasses in high school and was considered a "nerd", a term I despise to this very day. I made good grades. I was a teacher's pet. I did this not because I was lonely (well, I was lonely) but more because I wanted to belong somewhere and with the good grades, the high marks and recommendations by my teachers and other staff members, I made it to college at a much lower cost than most and with several honors draped around my neck come graduation day. I had made my grandparents and parents quite proud. Mainly because us three children, I was the ONLY one to finish high school and go to college.  Gym class. Showers were required afterwards. No one wanted to return to their next class smelling like cheap sex. No, we don't even like to smell that way now that we're out of school and on our own and able to pick and choose our sex partners.   I was fearful as hell to get undressed when gym class was over. I would hide in the corner and watch all the naked boys who would be men, traipse passed me and wait until the right moment, steal a towel and drape it around me. I would next run to my locker and quickly dress. Sometimes I would stop by the water fountain and run water through my hair in order to give the appearance that I had taken a shower. I was quite the clever one.  It wasn't that I had a small appendage because I didn't. And trust me, I don't worry about that department now either. It's the shy/fear factor I guess. The feeling of seeing other guys naked and having this fear you might -- dare one say -- get an erection while being around those who you could almost feel a strong desire to stare at while in the shower.  Warm, hot, wet bodies standing around you. Water streaming down your face and chest. Boyish trimmed good looks staring back at you. Teasing you with a rub-down. Handing you the soap only to drop it right in front of you and then, to bend over and -- well, you get the idea.  Maybe that's when my sexuality became alive. The ninth grade. I was so young, so naive. So shy.  Some of my fellow classmates were jocks. Built to withstand a Mack truck. Broad shoulders. Developed abs. Strong jaws. Big hands and huge feet.  I wear a size 10 shoe and my hands are small as is my frame.  I was often times teased when I did get caught not taking a shower. I was even drilled by the coach one time while in front of the whole class. When asked had I taken a shower, I lied and said "yes". One kid whose name I can't remember, stood up and yelled "No sir, he never took off his clothes". I hated that kid the rest of the semester.  I did eventually come to take showers. But I kept to myself and far off in the corner. After a few visits, it wasn't so bad but I kept my eyes on myself. I did let them stray from time to time but I was so nervous, so scared of what I might find myself thinking that I never had an erection while in the company of my classmates.  It was as though I were showering in cold water. Gym class eventually ended when I finished the ninth grade. It wasn't required in the tenth where I lived. But by then, the taunting had forced me to reconcile with my shyness. I eventually overcame this by pretending, believe or not, that everyone around me was -- well, naked.

      What is age?  It is time measured in years.  Recently, I found myself asking this question; among a few others but each of them were interconnected with the notion that age is merely a number. Still, we live in a place where few are willing to accept that simple and yet, fortified statement. We seldom rise above our own perception of age as being a concept we cannot fully hope to comprehend in one single lifespan. We simply grow older and then, we die.  But what if you meet someone who is younger than you and yet, makes you feel young as well?  Imagine the possibilities. Imagine the chances destined to be taken. Or even those that become forgotten and never drawn from. Imagine the notion that perhaps "age" is not merely a number but an idea of what and who we are inside.  There are some in the gay society who perceive that an "older guy" is forbidden to date a "younger guy". Some however look upon it as being a common routine for those seeking to recapture their youthful days of glory. A time that shall never come again for any of us.  I know that the window of time is a window that closes slowly as the minutes tick away from the clock in our bodies. As I sit here writing this, I am losing time. It is a war that I cannot hope to win. But the battles involved are NOT yet lost.  So, what if you meet someone who is younger than you, someone who fears falling in love with you and someone who had his agenda for finding love and a partner all planned out in his mind beforehand and then... someone "older" comes along and unsettles the balance of age versus experience?  The advantages of being older are as limitless as one who is young. Most older guys are experienced in the art of love making. However, some are often times motivated to cheat and lie in order to have that experience continue in a rather ungodly manner. Whatever the reason behind the temptation of passion brought on by the touch of a young person, the older version of ourselves should definitely know better than to play with the hands of time for the benefit of stroking one's ego or to spare the young the dire need of one day waking to find themselves older and worn out and even, bitter by contempt.  It is strange to think that someone I know, quite well actually, is older than this person who has recently entered into his life. A friend at the beginning and no falsehoods have been laid down before either of them -- none that I am aware of anyway. But the feelings are there, or so it would seem from an outsider looking in. There is also that hint of fear, doubt or maybe cautious behavior to take things slow at first while rushing headfirst into not wanting it to slip away too fast, too soon. Never to return maybe.  Others will look down on this: he's an older man and you're only ... well, a young man who has yet to experience life to its fullest. Think of the love to be found. Think of finding it with someone near your own age. Think of what it will be like when you're "his" age and he's so much older, frail and vulnerable.   I say: think of what you have to gain if you take a leap of faith and learn to grow old with the one who is not old in terms of years but valued more in respect, honesty and of course, experiences that will not only guide you in the days to come, but build upon the chance to have something you might not find in one so near your age.   Of course, the argument is two-fold. One might happen to mention that the time isn't right for the young one to know so soon about love and falling for one who is older; it has advantages being with an older man I'm sure. I mean, I am 35 but I look 20-ish. I get compliments all the time about my age and my youthful expression. Perhaps those who are looking out for one's best interest have the notion that the young one will be sacrificing good, wholesome years with a man who will statistically "die" before his counterpart. Rubbish. Who is to say that the young man might not succumb to an accident or fate first? No mortal can foresee their own demise.  Still, I cannot help but to feel that deep inside I am older than I look but how old should I feel when the time comes that I have someone again in my life who might come to question my age, my experiences and my life ahead of me that seems less in years than the ones before me?   I simply remind them that as long as I am able, I will be here when needed and I have no plans to leave this plane of existence far too soon.  In my time, I have dated a young man (12 years younger than I) and someone who was but 2 years behind me. So I know the spectrum of age versus experience and maturity (which is very very important I must admit). I know about the desires of youth and the power it invokes. I also know that age is merely a number; just like the total of how many people there are in the world who are gay and seeking compassion and companionship. Think of what the world would be like if those who are single and willing met their soulmate and let the simple facet of life: age -- stand in their way.  I write this with a biased opinion I'm sure. I write it also because it is on my mind this day. I think about it as surely as I think about where I have been and what I have done and who I have loved. Those are lessons that I cannot forget and dare only to remember in hopes of teaching another that life is not over at 25 - 35 - 50 or even 75. It simply changes form and again returns to its natural state.  That is to say of course, we are who we are for as long as we are.  So, if you are young and in love, good for you. If you are older and seeking love, keep the faith. If you are old but young at heart, smile and be content. If you are neither of these, never stop living.   Age is merely a number for some but for others it's a monument built to withstand Life.  ~G

      Exile  I didn't think to ask him his name but I know that I will never forget the look upon his face as we said "goodbye".  He seemed like such a lonely man after he had told me his story and he walked away as he had appeared: a wounded man. His heart had stopped in mid-motion and it seemed nearly lifeless and yet, he lived. He had no way of knowing that love had just slipped out of his life once more. It simply took one step and then another and then, was gone beyond his reach. He let it go and never thought to ask for him to stay just a little longer.  He had spent years, he said, adoring and loving the other side of his life. His friend. His partner. His lover. His equal. In the blink of an eye, the words crashed against his armor of protection and he was shaken to his core by what he could not contain inside. All those things, those littlest of things, he wished he had said and done were swept away in a single moment of departure. Stolen almost without a care for what and who would be left behind this time. Believing it would simply fade in time only to realize that time never forgets and it never ends.  It would come with the graying of his life that he knew what he had lost. He would know how it came to pass but as to "why", well, that would forever elude him. Even now, when it rains, this lonely and wounded man remembers and when the dream has ended and the rain has stopped, the last of his tears sing him to sleep once more. The reflection of him cherishing another is his self-made prison from which there is no escape because there is no single key to unlock his pride-filled heart.  Countless nights when passion was shared has long since grown cold and remorseful. The endless whispering that teased the edges of sleep and a waking moment just prior to dawn are echoes heard no more. A tomorrow that never seemed essential and never came to stay for long is all he has now. Unlike the man he loved, this passing of joy lingers on elsewhere and farther away than the eye can see or the delicate hand of a quiet man could ever dare to imagine as being touched again. A constant reminder that the past refuses to allow itself to be buried in the distance because there it would be forgotten or absolved.  Oh how he longs to feel his touch once more. The infinite desire to hear his name being called. The haunting hope that they will meet one last time before the end of all things between. The lonely man records those minutes, hours, days and weeks of having been apart. It is his natural way of accepting that time is measured in numbers and afterthoughts and so, time holds onto his heart a little tighter with each passing minute, hour, day and week. A heavy heart that must be carried inside a lonely man who only wished once upon a time to find again the romance and laughter of the one he fell in love with so long ago.  I watched him walk silently away at the end. He seemed different than when I first had met him. He looked happier maybe. It was merely an illusion I told myself. There was something burning deep inside that I alone could not rediscover. It was a sentiment that I, too, once labored long to savor and then, it was gone from me.   Much like the day when I met the Lonely Man....  G.~

      It was windy today. Winds of change? Perhaps. Or maybe just a side-effect from a cold front passing thru. Either way, it was windy and likewise, it was a cold wind at that. Not much "meat" on these bones to protect me either. Maybe "Santa" won't find out about all of the little naughty things I've done over the course of this year now expiring and surprise me with a thick, heavy winter coat? Hmm....  Thinking back at the things we've done can sometimes overshadow the mood we find ourselves in. It also can overwhelm us with regret and fear. Personally, I can't help but wonder how many different, separate emotions one person can experience at one time. Some of them, these thoughts of mine, are sensual in nature while others are purely inconsequential. Still, there are a few which defy reasoning on any one's part.   Maybe that's why we have shrinks in the world?  I suddenly recall looking into the eyes of a young man and seeing his life unlived there. A place where he is innocent and yet, so out of reach. A touch too special to ignore while I hold onto the carved hands of a wiser man who has lived that life of experiences and yet, hungers for more. A glance into the very soul of a caregiver who wishes to remain anonymous. Walking side by side through everyday turmoil that is Life and at times you feel safer than you ever have before while at the same time you sense a rift of uncertainty always laboring hard to take away that comfortability.  Okay, I know, I'm getting deep here and I don't have a purpose for writing this evening other than just to put my thoughts down to paper and then, as I usually do, transfer them to the computer where they eventually meet the blogsite template and the rest is history of course.  Spent this evening decorating a tree for a very special person who has entered my life. I say special because in many ways, he is a friend who has become a guide. Someone to relate to and someone who values my input and my smile. There are cloudy days in all our lives. There are also sunny moments when the rain cannot dampen our spirits. Maybe that's why God allows our paths to cross when we least expect them to. When we're down and out and fear that the wall ahead is too high to climb or too thick to break through.  I count my years in life by the memories I've composed and by the friends I've amassed. I have many of each. I value each of them and the one before is loved no less than the next in line. I love you all --- some more than you might realize right now.  Love of course takes on many different forms. One can say "I love you" and mean it in a friendly manner. Others might be "in love" with someone and that is of course, a deeper sense of emotional status that has no equal. We've all been in love and we're all loved. Perhaps that's the meaning of Life -- or one meaning anyway.  I must be on this deep sentimental rift tonight. Forgive me, my readers.  Oh the things that I've seen. The faces I've watched grow old and the smiles that take away time and sadness. The touch of a stranger who whisked away the feelings of hurt and uncertainty. The aroma of a meal prepared in my honor while laughter filled the room before me. This isn't just holiday memories of course.  These are the memories etched in my mind from times most recent....and a certain envy has endured. It is a hope that they will remain long after December 25st comes and goes. I consider it all an endowment that I am willing to accept as my own because somehow, someway, I have no choice but to keep going and be who I was meant to be to another.  A friend, a lover and one day, again, a partner.  G.~

      It hangs there inside a room. Any room will do. We all have one.   It is a mirror.  Looking inward, we sometimes find that what we see there inside of ourselves is a person we had forgotten ever existed. Someone we had stored away for safe keeping. Or possibly an individuality where we often times corrected our outlook on life because we feared the consequences of our actions which were usually questionable to begin with.  Looking outward, we sometimes find that the person we most likely cannot adore without contempt of some sort is not the person we want to spend the remainder of our lives with. A person who questions our every move, our every intent, our every decision. Or possibly it's an individual who cannot determine that what he/she sees in themselves is not without a fault that is subsceptible to repair because they've grown accustomed to their ways making them the center of attention in one certain circle.  There is a mirror in us all. We seldom conceal our own fears when we gaze into it. We endure the private critiques of our own worst perception. We owe nothing short of remorse for the time wasted questioning our choices made because we fear the unknown that has not even occured and may not ever come to pass.   The future is like a mirror -- it is breakable but it is also repairable.  I did a full week at work with tons of overtime this passed week. I'm off this evening and realized that I had not written in a week. I know. I should be ashamed.  I've been so damn tired that I've neglected so many in my life of late. I feel bad about it. I really do. It's just that I've wanted to make such a good impression at work and hopefully maintain a future with the company that I have taken for granted the time issued to me to do with others as need be done because my friends matter most. And likewise, my family.   For this gross display of self-indulgence, I apologize.  I'm almost done with my XMas shopping. Two more gifts to buy and nothing further need be done in that category. I didn't spend a lot this year. I was conservative in that area this time around. I didn't go beyond my current means. I did what I could and that's all I expected of myself to do.   Emotionally I'm making it up as I go. Through the days that seem so short and the nights that seem to never end. Memories that find me wanting a keepsake to ground me. The past that nips at my heels at the most inopportune moment. A passing lyric. A fading scent. An image that reminds you of their face. A name being called that sends you into a state of silence and you begin to depict the days gone by inside your mind as though they were glimpses into yesterday's that cannot ever come again.  Sort of like we do when we glance into a mirror -- the person we see there is us and yet, it's more than just a face.  It's a lifetime woven into experience and time.  And it's your future you see staring back at you as surely as your past is lost the instant you blink and say "I'm ready to be me again and I'm ready to see tomorrow."  ~G

      I once professed myself as a writer and maybe I still do. I recall writing for hours, even days at a time. I haven't written anything of consequence in a long time now. I remember writing poetry, prose and a few short stories. There were tales of adventure, love and fantasy beyond imagination. Stories that took place near and far. When the day had worn itself out, I would sit back and marvel at my masterpieces. In my mind, that's what they were anyhow. Sometimes, I would read of what I had done to someone. I miss that now.  I keep telling myself that one day in the coming year or so I will sit down and begin to write that great American novel or the equivalent of. Perhaps a story about my life. Wouldn't that be interesting? My journeys, my dreams and the pain that goes alongside the notion that in life, we all get older and sometimes we even grow wiser.  In my own brief lifetime so far, I have seen and done many things. I've moved to far too many places to truly admit to without feeling some form of sadness for those I left behind. Friends and enemies alike. Along the way, I even fell in love once or twice. And with that one companion I knew so well, so long ago, I spent a decade of my life learning things that made little sense at the time. However, I took what I had been given and adapted to it. I made the most of it as best that I could with the resources at my disposal. True, there were times when Hell seemed hotter than the day before. When the water beneath the bridge seemed to rise and fall at will. Still, I survived and continue to endure even today.  To capture an audience with a story, you need a plot. Something worth their time in wanting to read and something to cast them away to some faraway land. Or idea. Something with substance and a driven determination to leave behind a hidden message only the author knows how to master. An afterthought beyond anything materialistic. A feeling that can outlast the skin of the book's pages through time and beyond.  Maybe in 2004 I will begin to ink that story; that book. One page at a time if necessary. Maybe I'll finish it in the same year as I started. All things not being equal however, I can at least take comfort in knowing that I have the ability to write what I feel and what I wish to share with another.  Perhaps it is true that men can build cities but I believe writers can move mountains and there is no greater power known than the power of words in print.  ~G

      With the slightest touch, I am his to beckon and I dare not deny him.   In my dreams I fall victim to his pleas for me to stay because I have no where else to go.  It is my choice however to glance back one final time, in every dream, because I will not know for certain unless I do.  Because of this and more, he remains a "ghost" in my life. An echo of the man he once was. Of the lover he remains as but not mine.  Within the dream, the dream that I have almost every night now, the raft carved in wood is sinking and the ocean is ready to swallow me whole. I paddle feverishly only to discover that I am going nowhere fast. It will be dark soon and beneath the waters of my past shall I drown with the memory burned into my mind and soul.   In the memory that is now and forever burned into my soul, I take that one final glance in the rearview mirror on that last day and see him walking away but he walks away with tears in his eyes and so it is that his own drowning ocean begins to take shape.  In this, we are not so different. Two sides of a single coin that continues to freefall from some distant cliff. Neither knowing when and where we shall land. Neither wanting to second guess what we have done and said. Neither seeking to care what side lands first.  Neither dream nor reality can separate the anguish I feel when I stand tall and proud while trying my best to shelter my feelings to those who also stand around me.   My peers. My superiors. My competition.  If love is like an ocean in which we must sail and seek an island to call our own, then I sail the open seas with a ship bound for the vastness that I cannot properly name. A region of time that I cannot bare to predict. A place that I have yet to venture to willingly. A point in my life where I shall not want for anything aside from a notion that we are each survivors in this wicked storm we face. We rise above it and we remain vigilant that what we gave, what we forsake, can and will be returned in kind.   We are never strangers to regret but we are forever entitled to rewards rightly deserving of our own ambitions. We love. We fade. We hate. We stay. We dream. We forget.  We are ghosts. We pass freely through the corridors of one's life only to remain hidden from the eyes of the one who matters the most to us. Sometimes it is ourselves we punish with blindness. Sometimes we do not realize that we are nothing but a vision without purpose and that is unjust because we each have a name, a story and a conscience choice to share.  How fragile life is. How easily it can be stricken from the record. How easily we are replaced. But how difficult it is for us to be forgotten. We are immortalized by what we do, what we make of ourselves and by what we dare to share with others who are nothing more than strangers....or ghosts.  In my dreams, he comes to me and sits there and watches me sleep. I know he's there. I can feel his presence. My ghost. My watcher. My memory.  My immortal afterthought that was once so clear and real and tangible is now and forevermore, untouchable.  ~G

      I'm sitting here before work, and I had thought about what to write about because I felt this need, this drawing of something I could not fully retreat from. I once wrote for hours on end. Barely taking time out to eat. I would have strained muscles in my neck and back just from sitting so long while writing. That part of my life ended about five months ago when I moved from Atlanta.  Now things are much more engrossed by work and the attempt to save up enough money to reclaim my independence. To move into a new place of my own. To somehow discover the importance of myself and not become lost in the cloudy perception of what this recent alteration in my life has given to me. Whether I wish to admit it or not, things have changed on a scale that I can barely accept of late.   I write nearly every day about the loss of my partner. He still lives. But not with me. In fact, he is very much alive now. And he's free. Though far we remain apart, there is the single realization that we spent a decade sharing good and bad times together. Those are memories no other man can ever hope to take from either of us. But alas, we are separate entities now. And somehow, we'll remain this way.  Over the course of the last few weeks, I've changed my hair style. I wear an earring sometimes in my right ear. I bought a cell phone strickly for my personal use. I even purchased a new car. I changed my wardrobe. I even altered my likes and dislikes for food and music. Don't get me wrong, not everything has been changed but for the most part, I felt it was only fair to me to change things that had become so mundane day in and day out in my life while living in Atlanta.  I have also come across some interesting people since my return here to Louisiana. Some have given me one night to bask in the glory of their self-worthlessness while others have become friends whom I would love to keep forever. Still, there are those who have come and gone. Each with their own dictated terms for a good "one night stand" and nothing more. There was the power and temptation of youth. The dissolution of a friendship that would reach its peak on the fourteenth floor of a building that I cannot name here. The rekindling hope for a friendship in another case where the fact remains that there is something to be gained by persistence and honesty.  I am not by any means perfect. I never pretended to be. I simply prefer to coast through life, as it were, and try not to look behind me. However, I admit that I have taken a glance backwards from time to time. In doing so, I fall to pieces all over again. All that I have sewn together, this tapestry of life, becomes untangled and again I am forced to re-thread the torn cloth that I must remain enraptured by because quite simply it is my only coat of armor and I am indebted to it no matter what anyone else proclaims of it openly or secretly.  I have lost so much and yet, I have gained as well. Dreams and photos keep me safe from harm. They give me hope that what I once had can be had again. That somehow I'll find all that I am seeking and more. Whatever comes, whatever trials I must experience, I shall take comfort in knowing that I tried my best to overcome it all. I may cry but inside I am strong enough to admit it. I may even falter when the tide grows thin but at least I did what I had to do to show the world that I am not invincible.   I am after all --- only human.  There is no greater fear than that of growing old alone. Success and failure cannot compare. Once you've been touched by love, you are forever held captive by it's potent poison. And it is a poison that drains you as surely as it sustains your life. Your happiness becomes fashioned in the web we weave whereby we hope to ensnare a captive heart so much like our own. We remain strangers however while we divide the good from the bad. We even settle for the opposite of happiness when we cannot make ourselves cut the threads that bind us.   Sometimes we are betrayed and this is by far the worst of love found and love lost in my book.  We often times become comfortable by what we perceive to be love when it fact it is nothing more than the feeling of completion. A completion that is shortlived because there is no substance there to start with. Nothing to build upon. That "fear" overwhelms us and we make our mark upon another the first instant we meet them or chat with them or even spot them across a crowded room. Love at first sight it is called. Who is to say whether it is based on truth or myth. Who is to say that love has any boundaries that sight and sound can determine in a single meeting. Who is to say that we're not merely living in a dream and one day soon we'll awaken and remember only the things that mattered the most.  In the dream, the fear was overcome at long last by the discovery that we don't need another to be loved --- we merely had to love ourselves first for someone else to notice.  ~G

      My grandmother once told me that there were no such thing as ghosts.  She's dead now. Has been for five years. There is no coming back.  I dream of her from time to time. She seems real. I can never touch her in my dream however. Just as I get close enough to hug her, the dream changes shape and she vanishes into thin air.  Sort of like... a ghost.  My grandmother raised me practically. My parents could never decide on where to settle down. I wanted stability. I wanted a place to call "home". Over time, that place became my grandparents' home. And I felt safe there.  My grandfather was a quiet man. He was tall, sturdy and friendly. He smiled from time to time but never too often and never without a reason. He never raised a hand to me nor did he bark orders my way. He simply ruled with dignity and respect and that was why I honored him even to the time of his death.  I dream of him, too. Not as often as my grandmother but every now and again, I catch his face in a faded vision of the past. A moment in time when he could be seen smiling. I could almost swear he was looking right at me. However, I can never be sure of what he is looking at or even smiling for.  You see, he reminds me of a ghost.  I spent much of my time as a little boy living in the country. Far away from the hectic city life. It was simpler times then. Lots to do but little to complain about. Life was good back in those days.  Everyone knew each other by their first name. Neighbors welcomed you as friends of long ago years. Invites were never without a joyous presence. It wasn't always a holiday to be expressive of friendliness but it was never lost in the pace of a busy wandering because there was no such of a thing while living in the country.  I sometimes go there from time to time. Not just in my dreams but in real life. I visit the grave sites of my grandparents and lay flowers at their headstone. It is my way of saying "thank you" and "I miss you". There are feelings that I cannot exactly contain here of what happens when I'm there with them both. Together again we are.   My grandmother often told me bedtime stories and not one contained a ghost.  Beneath the large oak tree rests a single marker that signifies the final resting place of my grandparents. A cemetery a brief distance outside the small town in which they lived. A quiet place, naturally. A place that I cannot find in any single dream. It is somehow a place that I can find only when I am awake.  When the skies grow dark, I take my leave but not without laying a hand upon the polished headstone baring their names and dates of birth and death. It is not cold, this stone. In fact, it has no sensation at all. It simply is. Before I fully depart, I always turn back once. A breeze pushes me onward. It is their way, I tell myself.   Go and live life and be free, our grandson.  I know they wait for me to rejoin them one day. It is just how things will be. You are born. You die. You are loved. You reunite. You are young. You remember.  I have never seen a ghost. Of course, if it were truly a ghost then you most likely would not be able to see it at all. In any event, I believe a presence lingers after our passing. A message of hope remains behind. A hope for the days to be simple, welcomed and fully embraced.  Ghosts or not, I walk the world searching for a way to prove their worth in me and in all that I do. If they were here, alive, they would see the pride in my eye. The feeling of giving in my written words. The chance to be free and loved in my heart that endures the trials and tribulations of life gone astray at times.  I can almost touch it now.  This place I see in my dreams.  A ghost one might assume is always watching over me.   Guiding me and whispering.... "Walk the path until it leads you back home."  ~G

      The rain fell miserably upon my face as I strained with tired eyes to clearly  see my opponent.    My adversary.  My rival.   My dreamlike revelation of a man I could never become and yet, here he stood.  Staring back at me with nightmarish eyes.  They cauterized my soul.  Burning my life away.  Ripping apart my salvation with an ghastly notion that what I could not force  back into faith would merely return and rise up to condemn me wholly.   And still, the rain fell steadfast.  Thunder broke the spell but only momentarily.  A charmer's illusionary trick that could not however be broken by a plea from a  dying man.  No matter how determined, no matter how much I offered in return, there was no  release for me now.   There was no sanctuary at the end.  The end of the world.  My life.  For the chance to return to innocence I would have surely begged on both knees  for a thousand years and surely another thousand more.  But instead, I was cast down into the depths of temptation where no one of my  kind ever return unchanged, unscathed or unforgiven.  Tears drying before I ever had a chance to give them names.  Tears that were wasted for the rain played my swan song and upon my face did it  ring true.  I fought against temptation to touch his face.  His infinite face.  His poetic face that few men could ever dare to stare down.  Eyes aglow.  My heart declined a single moment of life returned to me. The finale had come at last.   Pulsing fire erupted from somewhere inside of me and I did not fear its calling. I took a smooth step forward.  A hand reached out to touch my bitter wound.  An invisible hand that no man could deny.  No man could resist without first coming to know his worth in all of this. His intention.  His violation to be.  He was, in all his awesome metamorphosis from anything most human, a  Thief .  My heart did he claim. Mine alone. Father, please, forgive me for I have sinned.  There in the falling rain.  Listen now for Hell rejoices. God is crying tonight for another angel has fallen from grace   ~G

      Players.  Why do some MEN play games with the hearts and minds of others?  What do they hope to gain in the end? A trophy? A certificate of acknowledgement for their behavior? A sense of satisfaction for having made a fool out of someone who has a genuine desire to be a friend or something more?  I have always been this advocate against men who revel in the nature of playing games with other's ambitions to be a part of their lives. Some singular notion that pulled these innocent, unprotected hearts and minds toward them and then, they're swatted away like flies surrounding a summer's eve picnic.  No single age is excluded. No single nationality. No single dream is not without the confines to be bruised and torn asunder. Deemed null and void by the lack of a phone call, an email, a personal visit which might offer some form of suitable excuse.   A "believable" excuse.  Still, one excuse can sometimes lead to another and then another. In time, the pattern repeats itself according to the offender's design for the game. The game of setting himself up to be THE ONE and then, just before the last second ticks off the clock when his supposed match is about to meet him at long last -- the player ejects himself from the playing field.  Somewhere, out there, another has offered him a better contract. And the game continues anew. Only this time it's on a different field and with a different set of excuses.   A pretender is a dangerous adversary. He is also a dangerous ally. He thrives on making himself the focal point of attention. The center of the universe in at least a single man's eyes. He latches onto the friendship syndrome and the needy know-how of being the fallen angel in distress. The body language is exquisite if not potentially lethal. His words are alluring if not inadequately undermining another's prospect for happiness.  A user with only one thing in mind. Not sex. Not friendship. Not even the physical thrall of a simple handshake. It's the thrill of the game. The jaunt of being at the top of the score card. The feeling of elation that is truly transparent and hence, worthless and demeaning.  Some seek out the comforts of others because of a rebound effect. The chain of love has been broken in their lives. Temporarily usually. Others merely seek to engage in the game of persuasion because it's like a drug. A cost-free drug but in the end, it is a price too high for the victim to pay. He returns to his humble abode with a broken dream. His feelings are diluted with disgust and doubt. His hopes are dashed and smeared by deceit and anti-sentiments.  Still, he cannot relinquish the desire to be whole once again. The need to be a part of another's life. The feeling, the joy, the happiness that ensues when two who are in fact one, can revel in the beauty of trust and monogamy. For now however, the dream is still another night's wishing. Dawn never seemed so cold, so distant and yet, so still and undeserving.  The players however, continue to play the "game" just the same. Names are exchanged in conversation over the phone or through the computer. Numbers are merely nothing more than the hours spent getting ready for a date that would never come to pass. But the memories, the pain remains long afterwards. The truth has been uncovered. The player's identity is well known but his likelihood of altering his ways are anything but settled.  The game for him never truly ends. If it did, he would become lesser of a man, in his mind alone. For you see, the game keeps him alive. Gives him a sense of value higher in terms of self-esteem. A fool's dream this is. Self-esteem isn't stolen or designed by playing any game with another's heart or mind.  Self-esteem, like all other walls in life, are built out of a desire to be whole, to have the opportunity to share that life with another, to be a spectator to the game and not playing for the opposite side.  A player in the game never will have such a wall -- save for the one his actions allow to be constructed around him and upon the face of this wall bare the words: KEEP AWAY -- DANGER!  Reserve your feelings. Keep them protected. Don't play the fool. And never expect the greatest of expectations to settle the blame if or when the game ends at the stroke of midnight and you are, like before, left alone to wallow in your false beliefs that you did something wrong. The error of the game left to be recorded falls squarely upon the shoulders of the one who did not make an effort to play fairly.  True, to each his own and on his own the player shall remain.

      Miles to go before I sleep....  That's a partial rendition of an age-old saying from a time when the little things mattered most in our lives.  When the trivial was just that and the complexity of the day's events seemed inferior to the outcome that would rest upon a simple "yes" or "no".   A time that is often measured by miles rather than the clicking of the seconds upon the clock.  I slept most comfortably last night.  I didn't sleep the entire night and I didn't sleep alone.  I dreamed.  I dreamed about a place that I had never been to before.  I awoke, early the next morning, and found myself staring outward into that dream come to life.  Who could have guessed that the things we do and commit ourselves to would involve so many probabilities.  The risk of it all.  The chance that what we come to find is real and might even last longer than a thirty second expression of intimate pleasure.  That laughter would ring out into the call of night and find us wanting more.  That a hint of passion and truth would seek us out...or did we find it on our own after a long and lengthy journey through heartache and betrayal?  The only question now is what to do next?  Where do I go from here?  What waits for me on the other side of today?   What is to come tomorrow when the sun rises and the birds sing and the drapes are withdrawn and the day is giving its due?    Will I travel for miles and miles before I sleep?  Will I dream of a place that I have never been to before only to discover that I've already dreamed of it well in advance?  Will I sleep alone?  Will I remember where I've been after I am gone?    Will "he" remember me after I have said my goodbye's and stepped silently out into the brisk winds of another winter's night?  There is a flower blooming in front of me as I write this.  It is a single red rose.  It signifies the truth of love.  The reality of never giving up hope that what we once felt for one person can be enjoyed with another.  The promise of another chance to wake from a quiet night's slumber and find there next to us the one meant to remain at our side.  A single red rose that blooms and fades and withers but never ceases to amaze and stimulate the imagination of purity and the everlasting gift of beauty beyond compare.  Upon its petals lingers a song waiting to be heard.  Hush now and listen closely.  Quiet your weary heartstrings and heed the calling it offers freely and openly.  Let it sing you to sleep and once you are there within that place that few ever willingly travel to in a single lifetime, you will drive those miles between the two of you; the artist who wrote the song and the artist who sang the words aloud, and you will know at least that the dream wasn't shortlived after all.  It never ends until you close your eyes one final time and there are still so many miles to go before I sleep.

      There are patterns to every design.  Shapes that we do not fully comprehend when they first appear to us.  Moments left unmolested by fear or doubt or even resentment.  This is just how it is because this is how it was meant to be.  Events occur to settle our hearts and ease our minds.  We "go with the flow" while seeking some justification as to why one person harms us while another seeks to raise our spirits and make us worthwhile again.  We are determined to be miserable when happiness eludes us.  We are human and we are unmistakenly prone to fall and rise to the occasion at hand.  We can also overcome diversity simply by letting go of the past.  I know, from personal experiences, that bitterness has no place in my heart.  It never has.  It is a cancer that consumes us.  It evolves into something so powerful, so bittersweet, that when it is at last able to consume us body and soul, we are willing to die because we have been fighting the wrong enemy all along.     Ourselves.   I have spent hours, maybe days, attempting to sort through the events of my torrid past.  Time that could have been spent doing something encouraging or time spent with just myself and a good book or tablet and pen in hand.  But alas, I walked a fine line between feeling sorry for myself and feeling sorry for us.  But on the same token, I learned from my mistakes and have decided NOT to waste that time given to me any longer.  There is no coming back after this lifespan is complete.    The cycle must be broken if I am to be whole once more.  There are no guarantees in life, I was told.  There is truth in this as much as there is reason to debate the inevitable.  There ARE guarantees in life.  There is love that never fades.  I've seen it and so, it must be true.  There is the beauty of a sunrise and sunset.  The touch of another.  The certainty of tomorrow.  These are but a handful of guarantees and still, countless more await to be discovered over time.  For so many months I have carried a heavy burden.  A wounded heart.  There is no greater pain aside from losing a partner, a lover, a husband, a wife, a child.  But you heal inside with each passing day.  You smile and you pray.  You sleep and you wake.  You carry on.  You look back only when it is time to recall the happy moments.  Those fleeting specks of time that are black and white in your mind now.  Those specks that with the best of intentions will surely guide you forward.  They'll never leave you completely.  Memories are designed for a purpose.  Memories were made to serve as the fabric of the life we live, we forge and we share.  In the days and weeks and months and years to come, I plan to cut along the pattern of my life and make something of it in the end.  One day I'll look back on this and know that I did the right thing.  I broke the cycle.  I healed my heart.  I touched tomorrow.  And I took a chance and believed in a love that was given to me by another.   ~G~

       Within us all there is a spark of life.    A single spark that sometimes never finds light.  A light that never shines.  We never see it glow...we never see.   The last month of my life has been, well, a light above and beyond what I would have thought possible considering the "dark world" I've been living in of late.  A world without "light".  Without a "spark" to guide me.  To move me.  To touch me.  To love me?  They appeared out of nowhere.  We've all heard that old saying.  When you least expect it, when you least expect to find him, when you least expect to feel again, it will come to you.  It will lay at your feet, knock at your door, beckon to enter your heart.  And your life.  Won't you let him in?  Won't you let him touch your heart?  Won't you trust him?  There is a fear to all of this that I cannot fully explain.  Time does that to someone.   Having built a life with someone can sometimes rub you the wrong way when things didn't go as planned.  Love often times finds us wanting more and we are drained by emotions beyond our control.  Or our design.  What we do not know is what is meant to happen next.  Who is out there waiting to touch us, to know us, to love us.  Who we are destined to become once the pain subsides and the door to our heart is opened freely once more.  I have crossed over to the other side.  I have begun to rebuild that confidence.  I have discovered the charisma that has eluded me in the past.  I have found the strength to endure the long, lonely nights because there is hope in all that I do and can do no matter what I do or where I go from this point onward.  Go west, young man.  And that's what I plan to do.  I'm following a dream, a feeling, a whisper.  I'm seeking to find myself.  To know what it is that I want and need to fulfill my design for what I am destined to be.  To involve myself once more with the light of another.    The spark is there.  I merely have to hold it gently in my hand.  And watch it take my world from the darkness I have known.   ~G~

      Winter has seemingly returned for a brief bout of wanting to be noticed.  It's dreary outside as I typed this out.  Rain is falling.  Light, drizzle-type of rain.  The messy kind.  The wind is blowing and it's one of those days where you wish you had a fireplace and some hot tea/cocoa and something big and fuzzy to lay on.    Well, maybe not  that  fuzzy.  Somehow things today appear not quite the same as they did yesterday.  Maybe I'm not only another day older but perhaps I'm also a little wiser.  Harboring the emotions of the past has given me gray hair already and here I am merely halfway between 30 and 40.    Fearful of what lies ahead as much as I am uncertain of what lies behind me.  That is some concept if you sit back a moment, watch the rain fall outside and think about it.  The man who cries himself to sleep is a man with a soul to bare.  I don't know who told me this but I seem to recall it being spoken a long time ago.  I used to argue the point of why a man cries.  I didn't then, nor do I now, believe a man cries himself to sleep because he has a soul to bare.    I think he cries because his soul has been torn in half.   He struggles, with each falling tear, to mend the wound to his pride and his heart.  He takes what he has to work with and makes the most of it.  He fears falling in love with a stranger at first because it's so difficult to start over.  To rise above the hurt and pain and begin re-stitching that soul back together once more.  He has to let go.  He has to simply and forever let it all go and then, only then, can he take that first step forward and never once desiring to glance behind him for fear of what might be watching him.  Wanting him.  Needing him.  Or even holding him back.  When we come to know someone, I mean  REALLY  know someone, we come to love them for who they are.  Faults and strengths included.  We seek to remedy the faults with our strengths.  We sometimes fail but we often times try harder than we did before because we want so much to right the wrongs.  To make it comfortable for ourselves once again.  To reprise the music in our hearts when they tell you that they love you and will never leave your side.  To keep the flames of the torch we carry amidst the uncertainty of it all in order to let it guide our way through the darkness ahead.  However, as we all know, there are  SOME  people we cannot change.  Some patterns cannot be undone.  Some souls cannot be repaired even as the tears fall and the pillow they sleep upon grows wet with regret.  I tried my best to change another person so that he would never leave my side.  I have often times thought that I failed because I wasn't strong enough.  I was mistaken.  I  AM  strong enough.     The truth is: he wasn't.   Now I sleep and I cannot help but to wonder if he cries himself to sleep alone.  I can only wonder this because I can never again glance behind me to discover if it rains there when it rains here.   ~G

      Imagine the sun rising and someone lying next to you to welcome you to the new day.  Imagine a place where the pain cannot touch you any longer.  Imagine feeling you are worthy of love.  Imagine you are free at last.  Freedom.    There is a scar that remains behind but the wound heals.  The days of the past are merely fading images now.  Bittersweet tokens of a time when life seemed as though I were trapped in a bubble where no one could reach me.  No one could free me.  No one could touch me.  I spent this weekend with one of the most wonderful people I've ever come to know in my lifetime.  An endearing man who has taught me so much in such a brief time.  A man who has given his heart and asked for merely the chance to know me inside and out.  To know the REAL me.  All that is required of me is the willingness to accept his gracious offer.  This morning the sun arose after a mighty wind has blown in a rainstorm.  I awoke to find that I was not alone.  I also awoke to realize that the scar might remain but so does the ability to move forward and love again.  And come tomorrow?  Well, anything is possible....   ~G~

      Today at work I took a longer than usual look in the mirror at myself.  I seldom do this.  I have this phobia about mirrors looking back me.  Or rather, me looking at me.  Or whatever.  Anyway...I decided that I don't like my hair or my glasses.  I hate wearing glasses but contacts and my eyes have never gotten along so glasses it is.  Glasses it will be until some medical procedure (and money) corrects my vision.  It's not bad; the vision but I've worn glasses so long that now I can't see without them.  Sort of like some people have become with cell phones.  It's become an appendage they can't live without.  My hair is so, well, fucked up.  I never comb my hair.  I don't think I have since I was maybe ten years old.  That's twenty-five years ago for you who are keeping score with my age these days.  I use gel or oils sometimes to just keep it in place.  It sticks up at times and in places it probably shouldn't but I get compliments on it from time to time.  I've tried short hair but I do so love long hair.  I've grown my banes long in the front but then I look half my true age.  I've dyed it and I've trimmed it and I've bleached it.  I've done everything imaginable to it except shave it.  I stared harder into the mirror today.  I noticed also that I am so damn thin.  My clothes hang off of me like an over-milked tit.  What happened to me?  Why wasn't I given more "meat on my bones"?  It seems that all the "meat" went someplace else and damn if that place is one that no one gets to see.  Well, there is ONE who does have that privilege but he's not talking  (not that he could right at that moment -- it might come out more as a mumbling sound).   The only thing I'm proud of are my abs.  Who knew that a thin framed guy could have abs.  I guess I never paid much attention to it before but I exercise three or four days a week and I love doing crunches with my ab-machine and so far, it's paid off.  But that's just a side-effect of exercise I suppose.  I need to add some body mass.  Tony says he'll help me do this and I know it'll take time and maybe, just maybe, I'll stop noticing what others look like and trying so damn hard to compare myself to them while looking into that mirror at myself.  As I write this, I feel like I'm trying to get a cold.  I ache.  I'm cold and it's 70 degrees outside right now.  I'm also tired.  Long days and stressful situations at work are the reason.  And moving soon and trying my best to maintain a budget while planning for anything unforeseen has not been easy.    Am I have second thoughts?  No.    I must do this.  I hate it here in Louisiana.  There's nothing here.  Friends and family aside, there is no future for me here and I've come to terms that there is no looking back on despair and/or regrets with the past.  Texas is my new home to be.  And there's someone there waiting anxiously for me to arrive.  I wonder if I should cover up his mirrors when I move in?  Actually I hear his voice in my head right now telling me that he loves me just the way I am.  Perhaps this is why I see things differently when I am around him than when I'm left alone.  Or perhaps he is my inspiration and I should take heed of his words more closely.

      Life is sometimes like a carousel.  We pay the admission price.  We ride.  We get off.  We jump back on and pay again and ride the same ride.  This continues until we either  A)  run out of money or  B)  we become bored with the same ride day in and day out.  My life can be compared to a carousel.  I have paid the price of admission.  I have rode the ride and gotten off only to jump back on and paid the price once more.  The only difference being: the price increased each time I decided hop back on the carousel for a spin.  That all changed recently however.  It changed when I decided to say " No, I can't get back on."   Not so many days ago, my future and my past collided with a revelation that came from my mouth and heart.  It found the listener and caught them unawares but nonetheless: it was inevitable.   I was bound to be discovered and so, love springs once more in my life.   I resigned from my sales job this previous week.  I leave the state in two weeks and head for Dallas/Ft. Worth where I hope to begin a new chapter in my life.  A new start with fresh ideas and high hopes.  I take with me many things.  Memories of friends and a sense of maturity beyond my current years.  I also leave behind the old and the weary.  I will not miss that part of my life.  It was a good ride...when I could afford the price of admission but like all things that spin and play beautiful music, you have to keep the machine greased.  I believe, and this is my own opinion, some rides are never meant to outlast their owners.  This is why there are new carousels in other places and with luck and a little hint of fate thrown in the mix of things....we find ourselves smiling again because we know that when the ride ends it ends with a chance to ride again...for free.   ~G.

      Somewhere lost in the farthest corner of my mind's most private chamber lies the darkest times of my life hence lived....  The effortless journey to find some contentment in my life a year or so ago left me barren inside my heart.  I still loved but I also ached to find some inner peace.  Some emotional anchor to keep me grounded.  I had all but given up on my former partner.  I punished him relentlessly for his past indiscretions which I dare not list here and now.  That is a dark time that remains behind the doors leading to the chamber where all my secrets go to roam until there is nothing left remaining to graze upon.  Until the last sustenance of my heart is digested and the secrets die as they fade into a solemn afterglow of what once was and will never again be with that person whom I spent days waiting for to come home and nights crying myself to sleep while still waiting.  A gentle breeze catches me aware of just where time goes and I am taken aback by an afterthought of his face at the end of it all.  When it, our life, began to unravel and all the truths were laid bare for us to pick and chose over as our weapons of choice that were meant to be devised from the facts that would surely set things right.  His eyes staring back at me in the night air when lightning was disguised as anger and thunder roared in our words.  So many times before I had seen my own demise as far as a strong mind and willpower to match was concerned.  I had lost my confidence to overcome any obstacle and yet, I held tightly to the hope that there was a spark left to set the world on fire.  That somehow it was best to keep fighting than to give up completely.  I was the spark that had nearly lost its final amber....so fragile, so close to death and yet, it burned enough to keep the faith instilled within the heart that beat a softer tone.  A song that could not be extinquished by hatred beyond compare.  Still, for the fire that was, our partnership was doomed and we both knew that the end was inevitable.  He sought comfort in another.  I sought distance in myself.  We both lost all that we had strived to build.  In a war between two lovers who cannot persuade the other to surrender their misgivings, there is no victor.  And so, here I am .... a survivor and I believe.  I believe in what I feel and who I can feel for because I have touched the spark that burns inside once more and this time, it brings brighter than a year ago but the difference being: it burns for another.  No one has seen inside the chamber where rest my dark times since.  They are forbidden entry to this place that I alone carry inside my mind and heart.  I guard it as though it were the last piece of gold in the world.  I protect it as though it were the final moments of my life to be.  I shall always seek to safeguard what I have seen and done and spoken in the twilight of a fleeting moment.  I am the keeper of the only key that can unlock the chamber door and so, I take with me all the knowledge that makes me who I have become as a gay man in his mid-30's who has endured the tears of an endless night and the hope for a better day that never came to pass until I walked away and found myself not so alone after all.  Fast forward to the here and now and I find myself coming face to face with aspects of a broken heart being transformed into a hopeful guarantee for the future.  I know the kind of person I want.  Who I desire.  Their every move stimulates me in ways few could ever dare to understand.  Their mannerisms, their expressions, their faults alike make me want them more and more as each day we are together comes to a close.  A need arises to fill in the gaping hole left behind inside.  A man who can do this is truly a man worth keeping, my friends keep telling me.  They, my friends, love me enough to let me not forget where I have been and what I have been through.  Where I go from here is my destiny, they proclaim.  It is rightfully deserved, they say when I touch upon a question about what happens next and will it all work out.  Do not seek to find the answers the instant you ask the question or you'll drive yourself insane.    Most of all, I hear you loud and clear, "Cookie".  Loud and clear, my love.  From beneath the door that shelters the chamber of dark times of my past, I sometimes catch a glimpse of a bright light flashing as if the storm behind it never ended.  A flash of something said or done that never quite made sense to me at the time.  I still ponder upon what went wrong.  I do this because I do not wish to endure the same storm twice.  Or perhaps I am seeking something wrong when there is nothing wrong to discover.  A precautionary but expected reaction to a certain phrase spoken by someone new who isn't someone I once knew but someone I wish to know more of.  Deeper within.  Longer in years.  Always at my side.  I close my eyes then.  The lightning of the failing storm can't reach me there.  I am safe once again.  Safe in his arms when the light of another day greets me kindly.  I am here and I am ready to touch his face because I see there inside his eyes a reflection of what I have always wanted to see.  And what might this be, should one ask?  I shall tell you this .... I want him to see just a glimpse of that chamber there inside my mind and if he is ever lucky enough to see my tears filter out my pain and hurt, then he'll know for certain that I am cleansed because love isn't over when two cannot be one....it's over when the power of one cannot maintain the structure of two any further.  May the chamber be forgotten in the years to come.  May it never crack and flood my heart with stained memories of yesterday.  May it vanish from view one bright morning when I find myself looking into "his" eyes upon my first glimpse of tomorrow being born today.  I pray and I hope.  I laugh and I cry.  I smile and I feel.  I am and we are.  Won't you walk with me?  Hold my hand and cry when I cry.  What do you see there?  What do you see?  Tell me .... one day when we are older.  Wiser.  Gray and frail.  When we are together.  Still.

      Drove down to my parents this evening.  Haven't visited with them since Christmas Day.  Things that should be said must be said before I move out of state.  It's not a ritual that I tend to annually or even when I am in the process of moving (which seems to be a yearly ritual in itself).  Whatever comes about in the future will be determined by what I do in the here and now.  The present shapes the future and the past is always a shadow lingering in the background.  The only difference being: there is a light ahead of me now and we all know that light is mightier than darkness.  It has always been the underlying issue of what is best for our children.  What life he or she will lead.  Who they'll come to love.  Their lifestyle is often times no different or any less alien to the fact that no one can determine this fate we are guaranteed to endure.  Gay or straight; it is a choice set in stone by nature alone.  I love my parents.  They love me.  However, I am certain that in the back of their minds they would have chosen an alternate path for my life.  A straight lifestyle.  This cannot be undone now.  It simply and forever remains a choice that I made years ago out of the characteristics that I was fortunate enough to have been given.  I chose to be gay under the conditions set forth within my mind and heart.  I chose to lay alongside another man.    My choice has not gone unnoticed.  Whatever happens to me now has become a test for me.  I have tried in the past to prove my worth to not only my family but also, my partner.  I failed at times however to make any one person understand my choices that led me to undo what we once done: my sense of confidence and self-worth.    I lost my partner of ten years not so long ago and though he remains very much alive, the fears of settling down and being content seemed to have escape him from time to time and so, I was left with an empty shell of a heart and that emptiness nearly consumed me whole.  Like that injustice of being abandoned because of insecurity of one's self and the fears of commitment from the man I would have moved Heaven and Earth for, I refuse to lose my parents to the fears of my being gay.  AIDS, gay-bashing, STD's, etc. are a facet of the gay lifestyle that I cannot and will not ignore.  My family is quite aware of these hazards I face on a daily basis but what sets me apart from the rest of society is that I am responsible and mature and demand mutual respect from those I date and come to love.  So here I am.  Sitting with my parents.  Here in a small and quaint little town in the middle of what some might classify as: Nowhere.  True, they know my lifestyle.  They've seen me with my former partner.  He was always welcomed in their home and mainly because in their eyes he made me happy.  But times changed.  He changed.  I have since changed as well.  This change on my part and the decisions about to be made can only be taken in by my parents as another juncture in a life that has seen more than it's fair share of turmoil and likewise, happy moments sparingly scattered about.  My parents love me.  This much I am certain.  Do they worry about me?  That goes without saying.  It's a mother's purpose in life to be concerned and protective over her children.  A father's right to be instructive and demanding of one's objectives when securing the love of his child.  Whether this be a daughter or ... a son.  My heart was broken not so long ago.  The pieces are there for the fixing.  I just have to put them together and I now have help.  I came here to see my parents and to set their minds at ease.  I am safe.  I am happier.  I am free to make my choices just as I did years ago when I came out of the closet and faced the wide world of religious fanatics and disease.    I wish in many many ways that my heart had never been broken.  I wish the pieces had not been so hard to discover again.  I wish that my parents had pushed me farther than they ever tried to do when I was younger.  But I had to find my own way through this mesmeric journey called Life.  You never know where you're going to end up or who you're going to meet along the way.  Love is a fragile piece of being human.  It's a gift really.  Treat as such or you'll lose it and may never come to find it again in someone new.  Never doubt that it can undo all the tangles of what someone else has done.  Forgiveness isn't so much a cure as it is a jagged pill we sometimes must swallow to move on in our lives.  If for some reason my parents blame themselves for my being gay, they would never say this to me.  Nor would I ever assume to blame them for the results of my choices thus far.  I made my bed long ago and I have slept it in alone and with someone and if truth be told: If I could go back and do it all over again, I would do it just the same because being here with my parents in this small town and at a point where I'm about to make another big move is right where I belong and you know something else?  It feels like I made the right choice after all.

      Dentists always make me nervous.    I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's the metal/sharp objects that they like to use to test the boundaries of your mouth.  Or maybe it's that music they play in the lobby.  Or the bill at the end of the session.  Either way, I always come out of the office feeling like some part of a scrapped Boeing 757 is now and forever etched into the unseen corners of my teeth and I'm three-fourths poorer than when I first entered the waiting room.  Needless to say, I return next week to receive the  FULL  outlook on what I have to have done with my mouth and how much it's going to set me back.  I really need to find a good insurance carrier.  Or I need to find a helluva good set of teeth I can borrow.  But the truth of the matter is, my teeth are not in bad shape.  It's just that being allergic to milk, I lost out on calcium as a child and hence, it was bound to create problems down the road.  And so it has but not the point that I am losing teeth or even have gum disease.  I just need a crown or two so far.  And one cavity which isn't bad but he suggested getting it done sooner than later.  Don't they all suggest that on your first visit?  Afterwards, I did some grocery shopping.  Nothing special really.  Ever go into the grocery store and come out without what you really in for?  Word of advice, too: don't ever enter a supermarket hungry.  You've heard the sad stories.  Believe them.  It looks like rain this evening.  It feels like it, too.  But so far, not a drop to speak of this afternoon.  Maybe overnight.  A friend of ours, Tony and myself, is having his 40th birthday this Saturday.  Not a clue as to what to get him.  I've really only known him for a month or so and he's known Tony for some time now.  Maybe he'll have an idea or two.  Finding that perfect gift is always a chore that most never care to seek out but I would rather find something useful than something that'll just end up in a garage sale before summer's end.  Four more years and I hit the big  4-0 .  Maybe I'll have my dental bills paid off by then.  If not then I know exactly what to ask for.     Donations.

      One week into the new job and who knew that I'd feel important again.  I mean, even if the new job is Temporary at least I have learned something new and did the best that I could, right?  The rest of the time that I have has been spent catching up with correspondence and trying my best not to get over-stressed about things that I cannot change despite the notion that I am able to surpass the equivalent of my former self in a single bound.  It ain't gonna happen in a single day I can tell you that.  We're still planning to go San Antonio/Laredo this weekend.  Not sure what to expect but from what I've been told: it's HOT...as in temperature.  I'm not exactly certain what to expect when I get there.  I do know from hearing others talk: the beer is cheap.    Funny, I don't drink beer.  Beyond that, I will probably purchase a few trinkets for family and friends.  Maybe a tan (without the burn).  And a few good memories to tuck away for a rainy afternoon when the skies are gray and the hours seem to drag forever slowly.  (sidenote: Anyone else out there aside from me completely BORED to tears with this season's American Idol?)  I read a Fox News story earlier this evening about a 104 year old man who retired.  Does this mean that I have to work another 60 years or so before I can retire with a comfortable bank account and a pair of slippers that I still remember which shoe goes on what foot?

      I had let time slip passed me for some strange reason.  I had almost taken for granted my thoughts inside this flooded mind of mine of late and nearly forgotten to write them here.  Bad me.  So many things have begun to change for me since moving here to Fort Worth area.  A new job, meeting new people and making new friends.  Getting to know the area and tasting the cuisine and watching some of the most vivid sunsets I've ever had the opportunity to witness.  Truly an amazing sight that most never seem to appreciate enough.  The job is going well.  It's a temp job but hey, it's a job, right?  It's money coming in and that money is being put aside for future references.  For a time when the need might arise and I've always saved when I could.  I have been good about saving since I was a little boy.  I saved my allowance when my siblings spent theirs foolishly.  I guess it was a good lesson to have learned because with my moving twice in six months, I needed to save something for the uncertainty of the future and all that it entails.  I'm what they call a Tracer for a transportation company that uses trucking carrier companies to transport their merchandise state to state.  It's my job to keep tabs on when these loads are picked up and when they deliver.  The carriers don't get paid until we receive confirmation of the load having been delivered.  Simple really but it takes multi-tasking to a new level and there are so many little reports to keep up with and numbers and don't get me started on phoning the prospective clients.  That's always the best part.  Not!  Went to a birthday party this passed weekend.  A friend was celebrating his 40th.  He doesn't look it.  I had a very good time.  I didn't drink much but just socialized and got to know all of this group that's sort of taken me in since I moved here.  They are without a doubt, some of the best guys I've ever met in my life.  So I have faith that there are still some nice people in this world and some of them live right here in DFW.  This weekend I'm due to travel to San Antonio for Fiesta.  Though I've never been, I am hoping to at least get a feel for the texture of the atmosphere there and with any luck, a tan.  Still, with all of this good news and new beginning in my life, there are times when I feel lost.  Separated from the past in such a way that I barely recognize where I'm now and where I'm destined to go from here.  My goals remain the same: succeed wherever possible.  But the question remains: is it enough to be happy/complete?  The answer isn't always obvious but then, I'm not planning on failing again in my life when it comes to personal or profession choices that must be made.  I can't fall backwards.  I just can't.  Whatever happens, I'm here.  I'm real and I'm surviving and that's worth the wait and besides, no man has ever been able to pull me down to where I could not reach out for another hand to help pull me back to the surface.  I've reached out and found this time around many hands.  I am lucky and I am of course, grateful.  Above all else, I'm still me.

      I am happy to say that I made it back safe and sound after my weekend trip to Laredo, Mexico this passed weekend.  The trip was very nice.  It was different.  I didn't realize how poor that country is until crossing the bridge and river.  We here take so many things for granted; food and water are but a few of the amenities of living in a rich country where there is at least the chance to improve upon your standards of living.    The bus we had reserved was indeed packed with a mixed bag of faces and lifestyles; straight, gay, Caucasian, Hispanic, etc.  You name it and it was on that bus.  By the time we were on our way back to San Antonio, the majority of the passengers were wasted on beer, tequila and whatever else they had stockpiled in ice chests in the rear of the bus but we each got to know a little something about the other we didn't know when we first stepped onboard.  While in Laredo we found some nice trinkets.  Some blankets and silver jewelry.  I also found some true Mexican style sweets which I don't know how they are made but I sure as hell know how they are consumed.  "American" candy is good but this shit is amazing.    After we made it back to San Antonio, I asked Tony to take me to the River Walk.  I had not been downtown in many years.  There was a nice breeze blowing that evening and the cafes and restaurants that dotted the edge of the riverwalk were truly amazing.  Lights illuminated everything and for the most part, the people were friendly and were not pushy and/or overzealous regarding those of us, that would be me, who were in all actuality, a tourist.  In the end, it was an experience I shall not soon forget and was thankful to have been given the chance to go and see a different culture and a part of the world where things are not always rosy but they are without question and undeniably a part of society as we know it to be today and most assuredly, tomorrow as well.  So far the job is going well.  I sit in front of a computer all day.  Much as I'm doing right now while typing this.  I deal with people from all across the country which is uniquely interesting because I get a taste of accents and sometimes our conversations help to make the distance seem that less in measure.   Haven't gone out to a movie in I don't know how long.  I still want to see Passion of the Christ and I would like to see Return of the King once again before it leaves the theaters and before it arrives on DVD near the end of May.  I've been going steady ever since I moved here to Texas.  I would like a day to just do nothing really.  Maybe a movie on Sunday.  Sounds nice to me and I won't need mind dressing down either.  Lord knows I need to let my hair down.  I'm too tense inside anyhow or so it would appear.  I've been trying my best to catch up with other blog sites whom I've not read in quite some time.  I'm learning a lot to be honest.  And a few sites I've become a fan of because of a) the way the journalist writes and b) the stories they have to tell which parallel my own in so many ways; past and present.  Perhaps we are not so different after all.  No matter where we live, where we work and who we lay next to when night has come.  Perhaps we are simply strangers in our own eyes because we can't imagine ourselves ever really knowing the world as a whole.  I, for one, would love to get to know as many people as I am capable of knowing before I take my leave and cross another bridge...never to return to this side of life and when it is done and my journey has ended some will surely remember having crossed my path on at least one occasion.  That would be worth the price of admission in my book.   ~G.

      Is it me or did Spring disappear overnight?  I'm sitting here writing this blog entry with a longsleeve on, all of the windows closed and the AC turned off.  This is May 1st, right?  Oh well, I'm enjoying it just the same.    Strong winds blew into Fort Worth last night.  Some clocked at well over 80 MPH.  Luckily, by the time the storm reached where I live, the effects were less of a danger and more of a distraction.  Hence, I worked out in front of the patio window and watched the lightning cascade across the cloud-driven nightsky.  The display was indeed much better than what was on TV (which I seldom watch anymore).  Today, I cleaned the apartment.  Well, I started cleaning.  It's not messy mind you but it is Spring and that means spring-cleaning.  Then again, the temperature outside reads 59 and again, I check the calendar to find that it is May 1st.  Hmmm...  I also ran some errands.  Found me some more work shirts which I'll use to look presentable for a job where I sit in front of a computer for eight hours and type in figures and information that is probably a code for some demonic organization formed somewhere in the Mid West.    I also got my hair cut.  And when I say cut, I mean  CUT!   It's so short ... well, it's so short that I no longer need a comb, gel and the wind can't harm me any longer upstairs.  And here I have all those tubes/bottles of hair gel in the bathroom cabinet.  Maybe I can find some "alternative" uses for the stuff.  Suddenly, one just came to mind.   Tonight, Tony and I are going to a friend's home for a little get-together.  It'll be fun.  All that's required: bring your own booze.  I don't drink really.  Socially and only on special occasions.  That's  NOT  to say that I don't have the desire because like any other redblooded gay man, I have the desire for alcohol but mainly that only occurs at half-passed five, which is shortly after I arrive home from a long day at work.  I have so many emails to catch up on this weekend.  And at least three phone calls to return.  I need a secretary.  I need a vacation.  I need a winning lottery ticket.  Somehow, I think Spring is not so far behind.  It's merely taking a break before the  BOOM!  of Summer arrives.  Ain't that a bitch?!?!  Hopefully, my hair will have grown back by then or else the top of my head is going to look like a lobster's ass.  Now I must leave good company while I finish writing  Mother's Day  cards out to three lovely ladies in my life; one being my mother.  Though we're not exactly close, we are family.  That's worth salvaging; no matter the distance between us.   G.~

      After reading Jef's latest entry (a poem or two), and if it is Poem Day, I thought why not?  So here's my poem.  Yes, I did write this.    S kyward columns of steam climb toward Heaven itself from the depths below, from the core of our world From the residence where lived smoke and brimstone before last night, before its final hour Fire and ice now struggle to maintain what mankind no longer dares to explain The Devil is dead, long live the King Hell has frozen over at long last and you are to blame  Misery walks amongst us now two by two, twins without a spine Misery alongside her identical twin, Deceiver both to walk their path anarchically, unscathed The inferno has been smothered and all the world feels the chilled winds of the inconceivable The pits of Hell cast no torment for the sinful agents of the [beast with horns] are forgotten  yes, they are now dying A spoken vow hath broken the spell of Hell itself and you my love, are the one who did the deed  With a childlike promise from your lips to my wanting ears, heart in tow Hell has been chilled to its heart barely an amber remains to simmer a soul from such a noble but futile attempt to earn one's heart It will take [His] angels of Heaven a millennia to thaw the Lands of Perdition But far beforehand we shall all become vapor and ash What were you thinking, my love when you softly whispered to me ... " I will only stop loving you,  when Hell has frozen over ."   ©  2004; Gregory Cook

      Dentist visit today.  Have to have some crown work done soon.  That should be most enjoyable.  Sitting in a chair.  A man standing over me with a sharp tool and a blinding, hot light staring down on my face giving me a temporary tan in less than two hours.  I should have been a dentist.  In one visit, with one procedure, he can make enough to enjoy a trip to Bermuda and back again before I've earned enough money to pay my car note for six months.  I wonder though: what qualifications does a dentist look for when he or she chooses to have his or her teeth worked on?  Work has been busy of late.  Doing some backlog with data entry this week.  That at least guarantees that I'll be there another week.  Each Monday and Friday I go in with this dark cloud looming overhead.  Will this be the day they decide to "let me go"?  I can only hope that it won't be too soon because after moving and paying off some other debts, I need to start saving money once again for those so-called rainy days.  As if I can't spend money on a SUNNY day.  I keep having this strange and awkward dream about some guy standing no more than ten feet ahead of me, his back turned and he's taunting me somehow.  Maybe he's calling after me.  Whoever he is, I don't know him.  He's taller than I am.  Dark hair and cut short but then, in dreams color doesn't mean a whole lot, so for all I know his hair could be blonde and wet.  It, the dream, always end with this person starting to reach out and then he slowly begins to turn around.  I wake up.  I try to remember the fine details of where I am in the dream, who this person MIGHT be and what he's saying exactly but for all my efforts, I am unable to remedy the mystery that comes to play with my mind in the hours just prior to dawn.  With each day that passes I become a little more relaxed with my surroundings.  I find myself more and more becoming at ease with where my stuff rests here in the apartment.  Where I lay my head and how I prepare the evening meals.  I guess it just feels strange because I make it feel that way more often than not.  I know that there is this defense mechanism inside that tells me to walk cautiously forward but I know that I have nothing to fear but my own resentment for the past which plagues me in its own way of late.  I agreed, foolishly maybe, to remain friends with my Ex.  But as I've learned in recent days and weeks, there is a game left to be played where one's emotions are nothing short of being used as pawns in a bout of wills where only the true victor can be decided once the dust has settled.  As much as I would like to assume the battle ended months ago, I believe it lingers on with only one way to end the war that is.  I have done my part.  I have played the role.  I have been haunted, taunted and left behind.  I have tasted bittersweet justice in my own schemes to extract revenge by simply ignoring the words that can cut so deep and yet, the wounds that I have suffered have never truly and fully healed.  And I wonder: do they ever heal completely?  The burden one carries to be right and sane is a heavy one.  I carry this burden because I have a debt to claim from the past.  But one can only wonder these days of late if it is truly worth it.  If the consequences are far greater in value than what is to be gained when all is said and done.  When the final comment is spoken and the last syllable is echoed will the victory have been worth the fight all along?  If time is the only evidence we have to know that we are real and alive then I guess time is all that I have to rely on to tell me the outcome that is destined to be the one justified for me and my life to be.  Lucky for me, I'm a patient man.

       I wake up.   I take in my first morning breath.  I am alive once more.  I gaze harshly into the coldness of the dawn as it rises quietly around me and I feel my mind being taken under the spell of uncertainty of where I go from here.  Such is the happenings to the beginning of a new day where the remainder of what is to come has no place being found just yet....  ...and I feel lost inside while at the same time, I search for a peace of mind and a place to notably recognize as being somewhere I fit in.  When I first moved here to Texas, which was about seven weeks ago, I realized that I would be starting over in more than one way.  A new home.  A new job.  A new set of friends.  A new lover?    A new life all told.  And I knew, boy did I know, that it would NOT be an easy transition.  But I kept hoping that it would be worth the struggle to find something that would make me feel needed, wanted and deserving of what I had fought so long to maintain in my past.  I can honestly say that I am happy in some regards and not so happy in others.  Attempting to set myself into a new job has been a huge hurdle to overcome because I feel obligated to settle for something so quickly, so beneficial that I don't always look at what I want for myself when pretaining to the new job at hand.  I guess I feel that I have to find something that will set me amongst the ranks of the employed that I forget the factors of: will I like it?  will it benefit me down the road?  will it make ends meet?  I want so much to succeed.  Not for the benefits of wealth and material objects because quite frankly, I've NEVER been rich and I've NEVER had many material things to fascinate myself and others with.  I simply desire a comfortable life and the road ahead sometimes look bleak when you start imagining your life at 55 and beyond.  Going into the "golden years" without a retirement plan and/or a nest egg is NOT a good and happy feeling I assure you.  True, I will be 36 come June.  True, I'm not too old to change my ideas and plans.  True, I can make something happen when I find what I'm searching for and feel comfortable with but...and there is always a but...I know that time is against us all.  It feeds off despair and doubt.  It loves to consume us from the inside out and that is why so many fail.  We surrender to the haunting cries of the future before we've had a chance to overcome our own insecurities for what is most important: today.  On a happier note: I am going back to Louisiana this weekend to see my best friend, Tammy and her family.  I am also hoping to visit with my folks who have been under the weather of late.  Another reason to take life as it comes because as we all grow older, we grow frail and weak.    Because of what I want out of life, what I want to show others that I could do, I want my family to be around long enough to see my success.  To be  proud  of me.  And in some darkened corner of my imaginative mind, I, too, want to wallow in that prideful bath just once.  Just f**king once.

      There's another damn Worm making a name for itself.   This one's notiby titled: Sasser.  I never have been able to comprehend the purpose behind these worms.  The culprits are usually mad at the world and/or Microsoft for whatever reason or other.  Sounds like a bunch of "can't get laid" losers with nothing better to do than to create and mastermind a computer virus to infect thousands of computers across the globe only to have their ambitions squashed in one swift blow from an anti-viral program designed by the wizards at Microsoft.    Then again, if there truly be wizards in this realm, why the HELL can't they create a fortified defense that will make these virus programs obsolete when they are injected into the mainframes of most worldwide computer systems?  Of course, not every computer has a firewall setup which I recommend and the Microsoft site  urlLink  has the tools to setup such a firewall or you can order a free CD with security updates and tools to help safeguard your system.    Beyond that, I think the person(s) responsible merely wish to have their handywork reveled on TV by the media circuit which usually occurs at least once or twice every half hour on CNN/Fox/etc.  Then, a few days later it's nothing more than a faded memory.  Much as a virus is to the human body who quickly recovers with the right dose of medicine.  On a more personal note, my Temp job ended yesterday at 5:30 PM.  I was not even informed at work.  I had to come home with aspirations for a full week of data entry and there it was: a phone message which I quickly responded to only to learn that my services were "no longer required by the company" and so, I became unemployed once more.  I like to think that I did my best and maybe I did it too well because I finished much of their backlog of data entries that had been carried over for months in less than a week.  I always knew these hands were meant for more than just giving pleasure to a guy but I never realized that I would be able to zero in on a compounded data issue and complete the task at "hand" so quickly.    I guess you might say that I have time on my hands.  (Okay, bad use of a pun but it was a rotten end to a perfectly good Monday yesterday to discover you are no longer "needed")  Today, I'm keeping busy with inspecting other prospects and refining my resume to include my most recent work experience and also, to take in retrospect my ongoing mission here in Texas.  Much like Captain Kirk once did, I alone sit in the captain's chair and I pilot this f**king ship.  Now if I could just navigate myself through the next "worm hole" I'd be fine and dandy.  (I met them once, you know?  Fine.  Dandy.  Twins from somewhere in Florida I believe.  Or maybe I simply dreamed them.  Damn.)  Sasser indeed.

      When do you really (and I mean  REALLY ) come to know someone?  When do the secrets that have been left untold come to light?  What darkened path has someone you know and care for been walked upon?  Where is the truth of who this person really and truly is?  If trust is a fortress that one cannot fully dismantle then distrust is a foe who lingers in the cracks of that fortress.  It is a sickness that has no vaccine.  A cure?  Perhaps.  But there is no safeguard against the ability to "mask" our true intentions when there is a profit to be gained in terms of getting what one wants and the desire to make it happen on more than one occasion.  A friend enters your life.  He (or she) is an enigma because there is nothing apparently written across their face that details their intentions for the friendship.  We simply have no choice but to place our trust in what they say and do.  We do this because they either fascinate us in ways we crave to be fascinated or we are simply in need of companionship of any caliber because of something that has torn a hole in our fortress and have no recourse but to satisfy ourselves with the transparency of friendship when in truth it is a facade that one cannot pre-determine in one chance meeting; be it online or offline.  Their written words, detailed in an email, lift our spirits.  They ignite our ambitions to come to know the true self that has thus far escaped us.  We seek to solve the mystery of who this person is.  We need information.  We need to be certain.  We risk what we are unable to bargain with at first because the uncertainty that exists is slowly killing us from the inside out.  We feel the need to wander helplessly into the darkness that surrounds this person whose past eludes us.    We are strangers but we do what we must to lift the veil of the unknown, the unsolved and the undeniable urge to touch the heart and soul of the mystery itself.  Come what may, the power that the mystery emits is a temptation few could ever dare to escape from and if one could escape -- what would have been the benefits of such a struggle to begin with if not for the underlying mystery of this new person in our life?  Solving this mystery is sometimes as fun, if not as exciting, as chasing after the chance to discover just what the mystery might have to offer us in the days, weeks and months to come.  This stranger who has cascaded into our lives from whatever means; internet, acquaintance, chance meeting, a set-up, etc., carries with them a certain amount of prospective hope that might well develop into something more.  Something greater than friendship.  Something deeper than love (if that is possible).  The journey is a long one in some cases.  In others it is a swift blow to one's ego and dignity.  We are fools in the game of "happenstance".  We know no better because we are thrilled by the sudden burst of attention with merely a first and last name to classify the other person as even existing.  We are expecting the good to overcome the bad and in the briefest of moments, we are each victims to the wild sensation that whatever we have in common will surely catapult the two of us, friend and likewise, to a new level of existence.  We believe and dramatically bask in the glory of the fact: we are  not  so alone after all.  So, who is this person who has taken our attention?  What secrets do they carry beneath their skin so soft, so pure, so human?  What pains have they suffered and dare not recall for pity's sake?  What love has been lost in their dried tear stains upon their pillows?  Who is the mysterious and what is the mystery that awaits one to solve because without the foundation of friendships borne out of a chance meeting, what is the meaning of the mystery behind the reason we are even here at all?  Risk the emotional pull to know the person who has captivated your mind and heart into a state of excitement and thrill.  Chances taken might be worth the effort in the end and one can only ponder upon the long-term possibilities.  Seek out the mystery as though it were your own to solve.  The secrets we hold close to our hearts are sometimes shared by another who has walked upon that same darkened path of yesterday and before.  Who knows .... together you just might find the answers to your own questions that you've been seeking for so very long now.

      Visited my parents for Mother's Day.  We BBQ'ed and gifts were given and as we ate, we talked and talked some more and then, it was time to return home.  After five hours on the road, my bed never felt so good to lay in once more.  While in Louisiana, I also visited with my best friend, Tammy and her parents.  It was nice to see her again as I've missed "cutting up" with her.  We have always been close as we've known each other for nearly 12 years now.  She and I have been through a lot together and somehow we've managed to remain close even when I had moved so far away.  Those friends are indeed hard to find and keep these days.  I did not come back alone.  I brought with me some more of my things that had been kept in storage since September of last year.  In two weeks I return once again and gathering together what I hope to be the last of my stuff and again, put into storage here in Hurst.  One day before long I'd love to have a place big enough for  ALL  of my things.  One day....  Sifting through some of those boxes that were brought back I found myself captured by memories of old.  Postcards and old photos of my "past" life.  It is a somber afterthought because of so many years invested with that person.  So many plans made that never came to pass.  So many nights spent wondering about "what if" and moments shared enraptured by intimacy where you imagined that the two of you were the last survivors of some natural disaster left on earth.  Okay, maybe it was not that deep but it sure as hell felt good while engaged in the entanglement of what was once upon a time considered "love making".  Still, to this day, I find myself locked in a battle with myself over the expression of another's touch.  Why does it feel so strange at times?  True, we all feel differently and yet, how far did the touch go when felt?  One can only wonder now.  There are new experiences to savor these days however.  A look across the room and you suddenly realize you are no longer alone.  Happiness is like a falling star.  You see it, you reach for it.  You catch it and you own the world.   Your  world.  As for the mementos of old?  I trashed them without a second thought and that was that.

Smothered pork chops with garlic.   37. From what news source do you receive the bulk of your news?   What?  News is actual?   38.

It's still my lifelong dream.   49. Do you believe in a afterlife?  Maybe that's why it's called "afterlife".  We aren't meant to know for sure if it exists or not and if it does or doesn't, there is no coming back.   50. What would you like to accomplish with the remaining years of your life?   I want to be happy again. I want a home to call my own and share with someone.  I want to retire before I'm too old to enjoy my golden years. I want to write a book about my life experiences and I want to see a foreign country at least once before my age-old eyes close one last time.

      What a week this has been thus far and here it is only Wednesday.  First, my former employer calls up and asks for me to return to work for them.  They gave me 8 hours to decide.  My temporary assignment must have impressed them or something because when I was certain that I would never return there to work but I was mistaken.  Monday morning I returned to work and so far, I'm doing all and more of what they would have me do.  Yes, the pay remains the same.  Then, last night another company calls me after I had a phone interview last week with them.  I have an interview with them, face to face, on Friday afternoon.  On top of this, I've been having some problems with my chest hurting.  I think I may have done too much with some weights recently or I'm just not using them correctly.  Whatever the case may be, it hurts like hell at times.  The last two or three days I've not done any major exercise and maybe that'll help somewhat.  Monday night I heard from my Ex.  Seems he injured himself during a baseball game and was due to have surgery yesterday.  I wished him a speedy recovery.  Maybe I should send a get-well card?  Nah.  In many ways, all that I have become since moving here to Fort Worth is because of what I have experienced in the past ten years of my life.  I have dreams.  Goals that far exceed the norm but I just can't seem to focus on them lately.  I have this dream of success but not sure right now what that success should engross.  Personally, I have both new and older friends and a special someone to thank but spiritually, I'm lacking and I know this more than most might imagine.  It's not that I don't believe in God.  I simply wonder what's the purpose of my life at this juncture.  Or maybe I'm rushing the outcome of it all because I truly and deeply fear The Long Sleep that's never-ending.  Will anyone remember me?  Will anyone recall that I influenced their life at one point or another?  Will they notice that I'm no longer around?  I guess I could spend the remainder of my life seeking to please everyone else but myself.  I could take for granted love as I have in the past and have nothing to show for it in the end.  I could do many things as I have done in the past and be no better off but if I continue to live in regret I'll never know what the other side of the coin has to offer unless I flip it over and take chances and risks where they are needed most.  There are many roads to travel in life because we each make choice we have no idea what will become of them down one of those untraveled roads we must venture upon.  We cast our luck into the wind and hope for the best.  We can only make the best possible decision based on the circumstances at that particular moment.  The rest is up to consequence and the ever-changing realm of possibility that forever evolves to suit the needs of Fate in this unbalanced universe of ours.  Crashing back to earth now....  Received a  PS 2  as my "early" birthday gift (June 18th is the official date for all those wishing to send me an Ecard for my Bday).  Thanx Tony.  Love you!  Return to Louisiana this weekend to gather together the remainder of my things in storage.  A collection of boxes and what not that have been kept in a tin building at a storage facility since September of 2003.  I guess you can say that after this weekend, everything I have will be a little closer to where I now reside.  I'll sleep better at night knowing this.  Found a really cool bookstore,  Half Priced Books , and have begun collecting books again.  I am hoping to read some this summer.  I love books.  Also want to find a nice little cafe somewhere that I can escape to for an hour or so and maybe, just maybe, begin writing again.  Something worthy of my talent to put words to paper if you will.  Something with substance.  Something ... inviting to the imagination.  Reader beware.  Don't laugh but I plan to go and see  Shrek 2!  very soon.  Call me a 'kid at heart'.  God knows that I haven't aged in the last ten years.  Just wait, they say.  It'll catch up to you one day real soon.  Like all things I suppose, we can't escape every aspect of time and destiny.

      Where does the time go when you realize that you haven't taken a moment to write, relax or just contemplate the meaning of life?  Okay, scratch that last bit of mind boggling bulls**t.  It's not worth it.  Trust me.  I've tried and I didn't get very far with the "contemplating".  Dental appointment today.  Had to have a filling redone.  That's always fun I'm sure if you're used to that type of torture with plastic and metal being shoved into your mouth and all you can do is peer into space because there isn't a whole lot else to do but sit tight and enjoy the ride.  Such as it is.  I go back in July to have some crown work done.  After that I should be right as rain as they say.  At least from the dentist's prospective.  Tonight's menu: SOUP.  Returned from Louisiana on Saturday night with my things in tow.  One U-Haul trailer full.  Barely a 5 by 8.  How  PATHETIC  is that?  All my furniture I left behind in Atlanta shortly before I moved to Louisiana where I stayed with my best friend for nearly six months.  Then, I meet this really nice guy named Tony and here I am.  In Roanoke, Texas; population 5,100 and a few cows.  My job is still going well.  I'm still coordinating loads with carriers nationwide.  Making certain all is well in the world of Transportation.  When they're happy, my boss is happy and when my boss is happy, I get to return to work the following day.  I'm still dreaming about tornadoes.  A book referencing dreams said that it was due to "repressed anger or unrelinquished desires to express anger over former events pertaining to a wounded heart or soul".  Huh, well, like, yeah!  Received word from my Ex the other night.  A voice message actually.  If you might recall, he injured himself playing baseball recently and had to have surgery resulting in crutches and the likes.  Well, seems he fell down the stairs a few nights later.  FYI: I didn't push him.  He says he's okay.  Stitches, light concussion and some bruising.  Beyond that, I can only hope some sense got knocked into him.  Either that or his current boyfriend really has grown tired of sleeping in the wet spot.   Question:  Why is it when a "gay" guy who is single, or supposedly so, discovers that "you" are not single, he seems to forget you exist or no longer has contact with you?  Is this "person" not willing to be merely friends?  Or is there some other motive that escapes the normalcy of two gay men getting to know one another WITHOUT having sex?  Inquiring minds would like to know.  Myself counted amongst them.   Question #2:   What is a good read this summer?  Any suggestions out there?

      Another week has gone by and I seem to have neglected my writing time once more.  I have no excuse really.  Just work, sleep, eat and do the entire routine over again the next day.  That's the sum of one's life in most cases though I suppose.  That's not to say that I don't have a life because quite frankly, I do.  I just tend to neglect certain avenues of that "life".  Such as: writing on my blogsite.  I'm guilty as charged.  Last night, we had some very turbulent weather.  A brilliant lightshow though with the lightning.  It crossed the sky, shot downward from cloud to ground, manuevered all around as though the bolts were strings aglow.  It was pretty but very dangerous I might add.  And here we were standing alongside a metal railing with my feet wet and gazing up at the sky and saying "ooh and aahh".  Go ahead, say it.  Idiots.  During the storm, we watched "The Others".  I had seen it before.  Tony had not.  Man, we both jumped off that sofa a few times.  Lightning and thunder all around outside and a freaky movie playing in the dimly lit living room made for one of those "anti-romantic nights".  He loved the movie, by the way.  Of course, during the course of the storm, and while we were outside viewing it firsthand, we also got a glimpse or two of our neighbors in a whole new light.  Drapes flown open.  Naked bodies floating around.  It was a sight to behold...if you're into that sort of thing but this scene was difficult to ignore: it was viewable from the parking lot and everywhere inbetween.  Very very distasteful.  Ah, gotta love the country though, right?  Do as you please I guess.  Or is that: do whomever you please?    We grilled on Memorial Day.  Nothing too much.  The simple things really.  It was a nice day though.  Took in an arts festival that afternoon.  I spent the entire weekend doing as little as possible.  I realized that nearly every weekend over the course of a month I had moved, traveled or been into Dallas and this one I wanted to just do nothing.  So, I did just that.  Nothing.  Recently I met some guys online. (No, I wasn't browsing the chat rooms) Two of them are a couple.  Have been for nearly four years now.  Seem like a nice gay couple who live in neighboring Fort Worth.  We'll see where the friendship goes.  You have to take things slow I always say with starting new friendships.  People of all walks of life enter our lives daily.  We sometimes merely judge them too harshly at first though.  And some have motives which are not quite visible in the beginning.    I think this weekend I'm going to try and catch up with some much needed writing and emails to some people I've not emailed in a while.  So if you're one of those unlucky ones who have not heard from me, well, prepare yourself.

       "There are no guarantees in life."   This is what my Ex once said to me.  In fact, I believe it's safe to say that he said it to me more than once.  I don't recall the exact moment(s) when the words left his mouth but I remember them vividly being spoken because I can hear them even now inside my head.    Eleven years to the day that we first met.     June 12, 1993.   Jokingly, I recall replying that death and taxes are but the only certainties in life but I knew full well of what he was referring to.  I knew that he was meaning the concept of "love".  The chance to embrace it willingly.  Openly.  Securing the stronghold that would most assuredly be unable to release any given regret over the course of time spent together.    I had hoped, at one time, that love could and would conquer all.  It is inevitable that we must die but I never dared to imagine that love would filter through the hands of time first.  That what had been done to me would extinguish the chance to right the wrongs in another.  I tried to make things right but for the battles fought, the love would fade and wither like a rose caught in the midst of a freakish winter blizzard in the midst of May.  So, here we are.  Miles apart.  A partnership fallen by the wayside while our friendship, such as it is, teeters in the balance because of my life that has begun anew within a new place, with a new person.  The dream endures however in that love must conquer all even if not with the person who first asked for my trust.  Whatever happens from this point on is a story as yet untold.  Whatever plots are spoiled and whatever secrets are revealed, there are no true victors in the war of love versus hate.  The feelings of old are replaced by memories of the new.  The heartaches will suffice in hopes that the scars that remain will easily be forgotten except on days when the matters of the heart seem to overflow and attempt to drown the good of another so close, so very close in terms of an emotion that cannot be undone.  Which brings me to another quote spoken by another...   "Emotions never killed anyone."   Eleven years later, I am given the chance to hear the wisdom of a man who would be king over my heart, my pride and my life.  A man who would surely lay down his life to secure my own.  A man who would give his last breath to protect that which may be taken from me.    Today I reminisce because I choose to do so.  I remember words and I remember faces.  I recall the visions of the nights when alone I slept.  When the echoes of an argument kept at bay the illusions of a dream come true.  A dream where happiness elopes with eternity.  I woke to find that the dream had not yet come to be and the dawn was quickly approaching.  Reaching outward, I found myself still alone.  In a world that I alone did not create.  In a room that I alone could not furnish with materialistic ambitions because I had none left to offer him.  Perhaps there are no guarantees in life.  Perhaps emotions never did kill anyone.  But just maybe the life we decide to live, the path we choose to take will guarantee that we are given a second chance to feel, to love and to die happier than we ever dared to imagine possible.  Come what may, there are but twenty-four hours in a single day.  A year in waiting is but another day away and so, one need not continue to count the number of days left behind but instead, the days left to behold.  Tomorrow is right where we belong.  May it find us content.  May it find us deserving.  May it find us willing to  believe .  ~G.

      I hear her crying  often times late at night, just after the tempest after  [his]  last thunderous word foregone of his last triumph to prove [he] is master, what a man he must be or so he deceitfully believes  I wonder why she remains often times just before dawn just before he wakes after a night of crying, pleading for the storm to subside for his anger to dissolve to hear him say he is sorry,  fully knowing it is a lie secretly knowing  [it]  will never die  I hear her asking why often times but no one else can hear the prayer, the sedated voice of a hundred fathoms is what I hear what I feel through the walls that separate me from her, in so many ways on far too many days  I hear her crying often times late at night when all else has failed when the love has turned to hate but still she remains and she devotes as he thunders and through the lies for each tear that must descend so does the hammer, and I wonder why she remains obediently his.

      Thrusting bursts of passion escaped from his unique bounty of despair.  He was enthralled by the sheer magnitude of the attention.  The pleasure.  The touch of another.  The sensual taste of an emotion given substance.  The night would be long indeed.  The two lay there side by side as if there were no space left to dominant.  The closeness rose the temperature between the two to a degree above that of a sunburst.  Sweat kept them working together as though they were a well-oiled machine void of age or strain.  It made the friction decisively enjoyable.  There they lay.  There they wept with the makings of a night spent entangled as one.  Hands conquered the absence of voice.  Words were not needed here.  Laughter in the soul could not escape with the sound of a whisper since the only way to release such an echo of remorse for the nights spent in seclusion could only be shared with the vibrations of moaning and the apparent aftereffect of movement deep within where sound cannot be found.  It can only be sparingly focused through the touch of fingers and the texture of one's lips.  Harder they fall.  Faster they tumble.  Friction burns away the bittersweet moments of a past life left behind.  A chance to redeem what has been forsaken without a chance to repeat the same mistakes as before.  The door remains closed but the room is shared by two now rather than one less lonely heart.  Beating of two hearts ravage the silence of the night.  Sheets draped across the bed express their journey thus far.  It is a measure of two souls desiring freedom.  Craving the passionate offering of another who cannot be denied.  Feeling the other inside has no equal.  Thrusting one's fingers into the cracks of another's hand cannot be duplicated spiritually because their souls cannot be unmade here in this moment.  A climatic overture to a night spent making love for the first time.... all over again.

       Yesterday was my 36th birthday.   I celebrated it with Tony who surprised me with a dozen roses, a huge strawberry cheesecake, cards and a very nice game entertainment system.  We later dined at a Japanese restaurant and spent the remainder of the evening talking and soon, sleep fell upon us and the end of my birthday came and went without a single incident of regret, remorse or denial.  My coworkers bought me a cake, a card and a nice gift.  My best friend at work, Leslie, treated me to lunch.  The rest of my friends sent me emails, phone messages and cards to make note of my "special" day.  But there was one dark cloud hanging near.  A card, a gift from my Ex.  The words inside the "miss you" card hit nearly too close to home and it made me feel, I don't know, distant from the past as much as it made me nearly wanting to ask why now?  What more must I do to separate the pain from the reality that life has moved on for me?  Does he still long for the connection we once shared through hell and high water? Or is he simply lonely now?  Perhaps, and Tony's best guess: My Ex is jealous, or envious, of what I have found once again within myself and within the scope of another who has come to surround me with their offerings of their life and their contributions there inside.  Envy.  It is a deadly emotion.  A powerful and addictive concoction which has not true equal because it forever outlives all things that matter so little to the one who must pave their world around "fear", "jealousy" and "doubt".  In the end, there is only the darkness eating them from the inside out.  Regret settles in for the long haul.  You die a little inside each and every day.  And then...it is over and you are forgotten because you struggled to hold onto a love, a person, a memory for far too long.  Birthdays are meant to relish in the ambiance of what has been given to each of us:  LIFE .  What some of us do not realize however is that as fragile as life is when given, it is equally fragile in the instant it is in danger and can be so easily stripped from our grasp without a moment's notice.  This has been no more apparent than with the recent death, no, murder, of Paul Johnson, an American who had family, friends and a life.  If anything, we, as a nation who consistently takes things, including our everyday lives, for granted should take note of such a horrendous loss of life in a country so far from our own.  There are no tomorrow's because just when you think you've reach it, when you have the chance to lay your hands upon it, tomorrow is still what we come to call "today" and that's merely the day after yesterday.   ~ G.

      Woke up early this morning.  Found someone in my kitchen preparing breakfast for me.  And surprise! It was someone I recognized.    That's a joke, of course.     But there was breakfast being prepared for me this Sunday morning.  Afterwards, we took in a movie.   Shrek 2 .  Very cute movie.  Made me laugh and I needed the laughter bug to bite me today.    The remainder of the day was spent just browsing the aisle of the grocery store looking for something sweet to buy and nibble on.  I found some Molasses cookies. And no, I haven't tried them yet.  Soon maybe.  Ventured to Home Depot and purchased my father a gift card for Father's Day next Sunday.  He's one of those type of dad's who loves to mingle inside Home Depot and he's always found something to tinker with at home or someone's home.   My father is retired now of course. He's in his mid-60's but still finds time and the energy to do little jobs around the house.  I'm sure my mother is grateful because it keeps him out of her hair.  But on the same hand, I know that in many ways she's glad and lucky to have him in her life.  This upcoming week will be there 39th wedding anniversary.    And come Friday, it will be my 36th birthday.  (So any and all gifts are to be sent to .... just kidding).  My parents met in Florida at a party I believe the story goes.  They seemed to have hit it off right away and continued to see one another over the next few weeks and months.  One thing led to another and before long, they were preparing to get married.  Three years later, I came into the picture.  A bundle of joy, as it were.  I am the oldest of three children.  I believe, non-foolishly, that I am also the most responsible and well-mannered of the three. I take respect very seriously and have always shown my parents the utmost respect and though I did not always agree with their decisions about where we were to live and what we was expected of us in school, I always did my best to settle the imbalance of keeping my thoughts to myself and not "rock the boat" sort of speak.  As I have come to watch my parents grow older, I realize that there are a few characteristics in them that I possess even now.  A glimpse if you will into the life I shall come to know in my later years.  True, wisdom is attainable when we are least aware of what we stand to gain from the experiences of the past but we are so very lucky to have the chance to know the differences between expressing yourself and keeping your mouth shut.  As for my siblings, they are in separate stages of their lives at the moment and though I do not always see eye to eye with their decisions, I can honestly say that whatever they do, it is only for them to rectify with the onset of the results of their choices.  Of course, as long as they don't disrespect my parents I'm okay with whatever they do.  I can only hope that one day, when I'm older and wiser, that the respect I have given will be returned in kind by those who once tested my wits and patience.  Something that we as children of our parents tend to do.   Happy Anniversary, Mom and Dad.   ~G.

      Have I ever wrote about my e-pal who lives in Russia?  I guess I haven't.  Well, one day while I was sitting at my computer, minding my own business as I usually try to do, I receive an email from this guy who lives in Russia.  He had found my email address through  Gay.com  ( some of you might have heard of that little gay site ).  He wrote to tell me that he liked the way my profile was worded.  Honest like.  True to heart.  Etc.  I took it to mean a compliment but I suspicious.  Why?  Well, for one thing it was from someone who lived faraway.  Second, I thought it was just a prank designated by gay.com to solicit email addresses and so forth, so on.  Lastly, I didn't believe that someone so far from the United States could possibly have the urge or desire to write someone whom they had never met or spoken to.    We've written to one another since then.  Not too often though.  He doesn't have a computer and his access is quite limited at times.  So we exchange emails about once every two weeks but so far, he has lived an interesting life.  His family past is equally interesting to me.  I love history.  I also love a mystery as most who know me have come to realize.  A mystery that I feel the need to solve.  A feeling that something must be discovered to be sincere and genuine.  Something real.  Something truthful.  Something lasting.  Of course, we all have a mystery inside.  A secret we've never spoken of to anyone; not even a best friend or most trusted confidant.  Something that even our partners do not know or could not truly accept or understand.  Which brings me to the rest of my purpose for writing this blog entry this evening.  Out of the blue, yesterday as a matter of fact, I decided to write someone I have not spoken nor written to in many months.  A friend whom I met nearly four years ago on the Net but have never seen face to face.  A friend I call him because he's heard me at my worst and likewise, I have been there on the phone and computer for him when he needed me most.  A friend who lives a 1,000 miles away but nonetheless, a friend whom I once valued and respected.    Now, don't get wrong.  I didn't lose respect and he's not lost any value.  I just sort of pushed him out of my life because I in some ways I had become envious of his success.  You see, we both started out writing stories and sharing them across the Net.  He had originally written many things before I came along and so had I but our connection with the common interest of writing and books became even more apparent when we realized that we enjoyed the stories the both of us had to share.  However, he pursued his dream.  I did not.  Last year he sold his story and it is now on the market.  He's currently working on a second book and doing other literary events here and there.  In the end, he's making a name for himself.  There is more to this of course.  In the past, when I was involved with my previous partner, my relationship with this "writer" was misunderstood.  You see, there were things that I could tell "A" that I could not bring myself to speak of to my partner.  It was not that I feared his reaction so much as I began to realize he wasn't truly listening to me when I needed him to the most.  Eventually this was proven true when he fell out of love with me and in love with a best friend.  And no, our communication skills had never been normal and probably never would have been.  Some things are just not meant to be I guess.    Of course, it should be added here that my relationship did NOT fail simply because of a lack of communication.  We had very little in common.  As I look back now, I believe it was more physical than emotional and yet, even now I hurt because of the memories that touched my life.  But life endures the pain and so must we as well.    But "A" replied to my email that I sent to him.  I wasn't expecting a response but I received one and it was cordial and full of updates on his life, his mother and his own ended relationship in recent months.  Again, we have something in common.  And once more, we've opened the door to dialog.  Where it will lead is anyone's guess.  But I realized shortly after my birthday that time is a peculiar thing.  It weaves a web where we are caught up by surprises and secrets.  We are vulnerable to fear and envy. Lust and desire.  A notion to solve that mystery.    To unveil the hidden truth and therefore, find the secret locked within to be not just another doorway to a greater unknown but perhaps .... to discover a clue to finding our destiny, our purpose.  Isn't that worth knowing?   ~ G.

      Today I burn.  Not because Hell is nipping at my heels but because of an intense sunburn that I received over the weekend.  Let me tell you the story; condensed format.    We decided to venture out and do some sightseeing. We ended up in a small town called Glen Rose, just south of Fort Worth.  Once there we entered the Dinosaur Valley State Park where several dinosaur tracks were left behind from the past.  Very cool.  Around this park is a hiking trail.  Several miles of it actually.  So we crossed the small river and began hiking.  No sun-screen, no hat and very little water.  Three hours later...we end our journey where we began it and I was burned.    No, perhaps the better word would be: cooked?  Sleeping wasn't too bad.  Taking a cold shower wasn't too bad...I've taken several of those in the past and not from the results of a sunburn.  But going to work fully dressed was a bitch.  Throughout the day I felt the symptoms of nausea and dizziness.  I grew cold one minute and sweating the next.  I know I'm to blame in the end and believe me, I will adjust that scenario for a later time and place when the next event outside the apartment is planned.  Sun-screen.  Hat.  Plenty of liquids.  Preferably a cooler day that the one on Sunday wouldn't be bad either.  Did I have fun?  Well, yes.  Would I do it again?  Well...maybe in October?    Sunday night brought about a special dinner.  We baked a huge lasagna, one of my favorite dishes.  Five cheese lasagna actually.  It made me recall the ones that my aunt used to bake.  Man, did her kitchen smell good for hours on end.  Those were the good days.  The simple days.  The memorable days.  My aunt is still alive.  She now resides in Idaho Falls.  Far from where I live.  But she remains close to my heart as of all my aunts I've known and met, she remains my favorite.    My parents are actually driving up to see her as I write this.  They should arrive sometime late tonight as it is an 1800 mile drive from south Louisiana to Idaho.  They take with them my good tidings and well wishes of course but a part of me wishes that I could go and visit.  To see the mountains and rivers.  To taste REAL mashed potatoes.    In other news...  I have been given some deep thought into writing again.  I mean, really writing again.  Using my imagination rather that letting it be wasted on the concept that whatever I have to say will fall on deaf ears.  A mistake I assure you because without the stories we, as writers, have to tell, who would we be without them?  The fantasy, the excitement, the drama, the love and all that ensues in the struggle between life and death.  Each one a part of the next.  Each facet of a grand design with a twist thrown in for good measure until the climatic overture is played out and the hero or heroine saves the day and lives happier ever after.  Ahem, okay, so I get carried away sometimes.  I have also tried to imagine the opportunity of what might happen if I were ever given the chance to truly write a book.  Even a graphic novel, which is what I really want to see in print.  How would I encompass the thrill and the imaginative power that dwells inside?  Could I do it justice with the right artist and storyboard?  Who would be my largest and most devoted fan base?    Would it sell?  As much as I find a reason to be optimistic about an idea such as writing a story from scratch, I find at least a hundred reasons NOT to be and therefore, the ideas that I have trapped inside my head remain just that: trapped.  A secret that most will never come to know perhaps.  A secret amongst many but a secret nonetheless.  Pessimism and fear seem to go hand in hand.  It is apparent with all that I have set out to do.  Even my relationships, all three of them, have been affected by the sincerest form of pessimism.  Will he love me forever?  Will he come home tonight without someone else's phone number shoved discretely into his back jean's pocket?  Will I feel that sense of security of knowing that the spark is real and that the man I have fallen head over heels in love with is there to stay?  Writing a book is no different in my mind.  Characters come and go.  They range from handsome to downright cruel.  They motivate.  They destroy.  But they never fade from memory entirely.  In the end, I have only myself to blame if I do not accept the challenge and if I should fail, then at the very least I tried.  Perhaps the ideas that I have can be filtered through a process by which the reality is accessible with time and a higher intelligence. Perhaps the storyboard will make perfect sense once the idea itself is laid out for the world to envision upon the black and white print that seemingly has no end.  It looks like rain tonight.  It's cooler at least this evening which is a rarity here in Fort Worth.  I may even sleep better than I was allowed to last night.  The burns will heal.  The heart will mend.  And the stories I have to tell will be written.  Somewhere in-between all of this I'll find the happiness I deserve because it was never lost or hidden from view.  It was simply waiting to be recognized.  To be called upon.  The story continues....

      The weatherman says it has rained now for 8 of the last 11 days.    Suddenly I feel like I'm living in Seattle.  By most accounts, this peculiar weather is not readily available to Texas but for some reason which only Mother Nature can appreciate, we're stuck in a rut where a front glides across the state and then, just sits there.  Sort of like someone might do for a brief spell at a local drive-thru window at any neighborhood fast food joint.  Speaking of 'neighborhood', Spider-Man 2 starts tomorrow.  From what I've read and seen, it's due to be much better than the first and though I wasn't a really big fan of the first movie, I have been partial to the comic book for some years now.  So, my expectations are of course, dampened by the previous 'sequels' of most blockbuster films.  Of course, there are exceptions.  The Empire Strikes Back.  Aliens.  And lastly, Shrek 2.  If all goes well and the rain holds off, we're due to go camping this weekend.  I haven't been camping in ages.  That's years of course.  More than four I think.  Yeah, at least four, maybe more?  Work has been hectic this week and it's only Tuesday.  They cut three people from my department and one of them was a good friend of mine.  I'm hoping that as a Temp she'll get to return soon but there is always a lot of office politics going on and so, one never knows what the effects are going to be when you are either classed as: 'needed' or 'expendable'.  Or even: 'favorite'.  It reminds me of a time in the past when I worked for a few places where favoritism ran rampant.  It was always a thin line between what should be said and what could be done and yet, the ones who said too much and did too little outlasted most of the rest, hardworking, dedicated crew members.  A sad twist of fate however plays in the favor of those who are cut sometimes.  The faults of those who remain, the 'favorites' usually spell out their own doom when the numbers begin to roll in and the truth is learned that it was not the 'cut crew members' who were making the mistakes.  Of course by then it's too late to correct the error and so, injustice runs deep even at work I suppose.  I have been trying my best of late to get the 'writing bug' to bite me.  So far no such luck.  I believe most of it stems from the uncertainty at work.  It's one of the best jobs I've had.  It pays well for someone who is starting out at the bottom (no pun intended).  It also looks good on my resume or so I keep telling myself.  But as we all know, if you can sometimes get your foot in the door, the rest will follow.    That or you end up losing a toe.  Or the entire foot.  Tony and I watched an excellent movie the other evening.  'Big Fish'.  A Tim Burton film.  Without the darkness that he is typically known for.  It is a very direct opinion of what our life embodies and what we leave behind when we are gone.  The stories we live, the ones we share and the ones we keep in circulation through the blood of our kin is what life is truly all about.  Or so the theme of the movie came to be in my mind.  It was very emotional at the end.  And very meaningful if you sit back and truly think about the things we are able to do and see and remember in our lifetime.  I recommended anyone wanting a different take on life to rent it.  I don't know what it is but of late I sort of feel like Austin Powers from his second feature.  I think I've lost my "mojo".  That can't be good, can it?  ~ G.

      Yesterday, I saw  Spider-Man 2 .  Most will come away from this sequel with ideas of how good a sequel can be.  I came out of it changed inside somehow.  Like life cannot wait for one to make it safe and harmonious.  We take chances.  We take risks to seek out some happiness.    We do what we can to make it possible to become a hero others will take note of.  Or we die trying.  Overall there was a strong message in the movie which made a lot of sense to someone such as myself.  I came out of the movie with an idea or two about the future and what should be done to make it possible to where I find the link between the unknown and the uncertain.  There is a fine line between those two aspects of the future we cannot foresee and I suppose that in most cases, we seek to hide from the future because we simply fear its results before we've even had a chance to assemble our wits and use a little of that common sense given to each of us.  I know that in the real world there are no dedicated heroes who have special abilities such as leaping tall buildings and growing webs out of their wrists ... although I have been in close proximity with someone who I could have sworn made the room turn colder in a matter of seconds.  Ice Bitch was probably his name.  Moving on....  In the real world there are no special powers but there is a renewed value of courage that we seldom seek to uncover in our lives.  We become mastered in our ways of doing the same tasks day in, day out.  We rarely ask of ourselves to pursue a dream which many have tried in vain to convince us that it can be done or is possible with effort and premeditated conviction about our capabilities.  Perhaps we don't need special powers to understand this concept.  Maybe we simply need to push ourselves to determine our weaknesses and seek to remedy them somehow.  To make the most of what we are given in terms of intelligence and for some of us, our risk-taking properties we sometimes gloat upon.  To make the effort worthwhile and in doing so, overcoming the uncertainty of what lies ahead strictly by finding a solution to a dilemma we could not have predetermined and yet, one that we cannot fully allow ourselves to escape from.  A hero never runs from his duty and neither should the rest of the human race.  Whether we scale tall buildings to save a child from a burning fire or stand in front of artillery fire to safeguard our way of life or even dare to work ten hour days while strapped to a chair made of artificial leather and typing horrendously upon a keyboard made in some foreign land we cannot even pronounce - the ability to rise above diversity knows no bounds.  It cannot rival the strength of the human soul.    In knowing this, to face the fear of the unknown and overcome it is merely one-half the struggle we endure daily for the sake of proving one's worth and hopefully, making a difference in a stranger's life.    Something else I took from the film was the sacrifice we sometimes must make in order to follow our destiny.  In the case of the hero, he felt obliged to safeguard the well being of the person he loved most of all.  In the case of the everyday man or woman, one should be equally obliged to safeguard those he or she loves but also....him/herself.  To not follow your dream, even if it seems so far out of reach and some might not agree with how or where you go with it, would be a travesty because a dream not followed is a dream dying day by day.  In the waning years of one's life, some will look back and they will tell stories of what was and what could have been.  Regret will caress success and somewhere in the mix, the hope that was and still might be cannot be dismissed with the notion that it was not attainable.  It was simply ignored and that is a crime far too horrible to admit to when you could have made a difference in the life of those around you and the life you knew to have been your own and no other.  So, I guess what I'm saying is: follow your dreams, follow your heart and be not afraid of what you cannot explain nor deny what you cannot ignore.  Go forth and seek the fruits of the world that is and will always be.  Make the most of the time given and do not take for granted the chances given because those few chances that are might forever remain out of reach if you do not seek to extend a hand and take what is rightfully yours.  Accepting this is but to accept there is a little 'heroism' is us all.   ~ G.

      Has anyone ever seen a dried, shriveled carcass of an earthworm who met its fate while attempting to make the journey across a hot sidewalk?  Tonight, I saw at least two dozen poor souls who never quite made it to the "other side".  They reminded me of those curly fries that Arby's offers but I have a feeling that the fries don't mind the heat.  The earthworms probably do.    Reminds me of an old joke: Why did the chicken cross the road?  While I was parading myself down the sidewalk on my way to the mail box and taking notice of the graveyard of sun-dried earthworms, I happened to notice an elderly woman walking briskly ahead.  She didn't really seem to be looking where she was going.  Her mind seemed some place else.  Perhaps on the day's events.  Maybe the earthworms bothered her in some pathetic way that touched her emotional side.  Or maybe she was thinking back to when she didn't have to live in an apartment.  When her and her husband of fifty-plus years shared a home together.  Then he died and life for her was altered forever afterwards.  Or maybe she misses her grandchildren who live in another part of the country.  Summer-time usually brings them closer but with an economy restructuring itself and fuel costs through the roof, her children had to make ends meet at home rather than enjoying a well-deserved vacation here in Texas visiting "grandma".  But for some reason, all that I could concentrate on was how she appeared as she continued to walk the beaten path ahead.  Her feet never strayed far off their mark.  Her gaze was simplified only by the foreknowledge that as fast as she was walking, it wouldn't be long before she would again find herself back inside where the AC would remind her of one of the amenities we have in this day and age.  A memory no doubt piercing her heart and mind and suddenly, the thought of the man she once loved who had been taken far too soon from her, returned two-fold to cast a shadow upon her evening stroll.  Of course, there is ALWAYS the possibility that this elderly woman was hurriedly making her way back to her apartment in order to return to the man she loved and cared for.  A man she looked after now that he was gray and frail.  A fragile reminder that love has no true boundaries.  Merely bypassing circumstances that cannot be ignored or regrettably, conceived beforehand.  As I turned the corner and ventured up the staircase to the breezeway leading to my own apartment, I lost sight of her as well as all of those sun-dried earthworms scattered upon the sidewalk.  I entertained a thought or two shortly thereafter about what stories she might have to tell.  What legends could be remade into truth.  What of the days gone by that never seem the same once you look upon them through older eyes.  What of the life you imagined yourself as having when your skin was smooth and pride kept you awake into the dawn of a tomorrow that never would give you what you were secretly hoping to discover.  Now here I sit.  Typing out those funny little things that most would never think twice to make note of.  Thinking about my own life and what has been as well as what will be.  Imagining myself older than I am today.  Glancing from the faint echoes of what I just remembered to the fresh taste of a summer night when the heat of the day escapes into the unknown above and all those dreams waiting to happen are falling to earth ever so fast.  I wait for my turn now.  Soon sleep will overtake me.  In those brief moments between sunset and sunrise, I will cast aside the skin of a day that has now worn itself out and replace it with the armor I need to defend myself against the new day about to begin.  This is the stuff of life.  The reason we make amends with our regrets before we come to rest comfortably within our beds.  The illusions are cast aside and whatever remains will keep us company until we find ourselves turning the knob to that door leading back outside and walking ever so callously into another day filled with duties, possibilities and perhaps even a glimpse of something as simple as an earthworm who wished for something more, something on the other side, and though it failed to make it across alive .... it did at the very least try.  ~ G.

      Where are the words when you need them the most?    You know the ones.  The ones that seem to abandon you when you feel that they and they alone are but the last defense against the onslaught of the world gone wild.  Wickedly bent on destroying your sanity.  Your life as it were.  Then, you wake up and realize life wasn't just a dream ... it was a dream where you allowed yourself to live it to its fullest potential.  Fellow bloggers have written me more than once and/or commented in the past about what am I doing to fulfill my dream(s).  What am I doing to be content and happy with the dream that I have perched inside a patch of thorns that is: to write.  For years now I've came up with well over a hundred and one different excuses not to write (and a few good ones I might add).  I would refuse to make time.  I would refuse to believe that I could orchestrate a simple legible sentence that would be so meaningful that it might actually send me into writer's shock.  Yes, there is something really called: writer's shock.  (And I'm sure somewhere out there is a treatment)  Of course, when I would have time to write, I would instead spend it reading what others had to say.  In doing so, I found that many times over I could write just as good as what had been written by another.  I began to second guess myself even further.  I found new excuses not to write.  And new ways to squander the time that I could have been using to write.  Go figure.  With changes about to overtake my life once more, I guess that I need to make time to write.  To take into consideration the concept of writing a good story and make the most of it while my life writes its own story.  A story that I know will one day make sense to a lot of people out there and to the rest?  Well, who knows what goes through their minds.  For me, at this point in the game, I have little to lose except of course, patience.

      I have a confession to make: I began writing portions of this blog entry last night. However, I never actually posted it and there was a reason for this. I was restless I suppose. Yes, even I get restless when I'm writing or wanting to but can't. Just a lot on my mind that seems to take precedence of late I guess you could say. But then, as those of you who know me might say:   "What else is new?".   (Today's color chart for 'Sarcasm' is:  Yellow )   Last evening, I sat down and began typing out whatever it was that I felt I needed to say. I had a few paragraphs written out but I deleted them and started over. Along the way, I became sidetracked by a chat session with a friend of mine who lives out of state and well, I guess by the time my mind became re-focused on anything worth sharing, it was time for bed. Got to love those days when the "wake hours" are less and less in terms of what you do with them productively.  I do that from time to time. I begin a project and then, absentmindedly, just quit and go onto something else. Maybe I have a short attention span disorder. Or  SASD .   Whatever the case may be, I couldn't think of what I wanted to write and even now as I write this I haven't the foggiest idea what the HELL I'm wanting to say except to say something because I feel the need to express myself and there by releasing some much needed tension inside my mind and yes, my body as well.  So, here goes....  Today, I was indecisive of what I wanted for lunch so I came home and settle for chicken and rice soup for lunch. I was in a hurry by this point because I knew that I had a lot of work to do when I got back so I turned the burner to high and in doing so, I let the soup simmer too long. Thus, it began to boil. Looking at the clock, I realized that I would be late and hungry if I let it sit and cool down enough to where I could eat and I wasn't about to put that into my mouth (though it wouldn't be the first time I put something in my mouth that had no business being there to start with and it probably won't be the last time either). So after a moment, I recalled something someone once had said and I reached into the freezer and took out three large ice cubes and inserted them into the bowl of soup thus making the soup cool down faster hence allowing me to eat lunch and return to work in time.  Thank you, Heloise.  Speaking of Heloise, does anyone out there think that if there was a title bout between Heloise and Martha Stewart, who would come out on top?   (someone out there is going to read this and ask themselves: who the hell is Heloise?)   I guess now that we know the scandal with Martha's empire, it would be something to see if Heloise revealed that she never actually wrote any of those hints in newspapers around the country or any of those helpful books that are for sale in local bookstores nationwide. Got to love or hate scandals these days because the media runs with it as though it were a hot potato. And they run far and wide until there is nothing else to talk about. Until we're numb and near the state of being comatose with boredom over hearing the same talk about the same folks. On that note, I won't go any further because I'll have to report my opinions about Bush/Kerry and then there's that whole Michael Moore/9-11 film which no, I haven't seen but I admit, I am curious as to the contents.    (Has anyone out there seen this film? If so, what is your opinion/movie critique?)   I called and spoke with my father this evening. He's taking this, his upcoming heart surgery, in stride. He seems distracted however. Like he's tired of waiting for the surgeon to pick a day to do the surgery. I guess he'll know for certain when that day is going to be next Tuesday when he and my mom go to the doctor one more time for a one on one meeting. I plan to visit them next weekend. Whether he has surgery or not next week, I want to see them and remind them that I am not so far away that I cannot be there when needed.   Today at work, I became bored. This has happened before of course. And I doubt it'll be the last time but today was clearly obvious. I wasn't daydreaming. I was just letting my mind wander off to parts unknown. I began thinking about the future: a dangerous thing I must admit. I had inquired earlier in the day about deposits for utilities for the apartment and I guess in my mind I began doing out a budget once more. Something I'm good at but to be honest, I hate doing one. But you have to do it anywhere you live these days. If not, you go broke and have to move back in with your folks and eat soup that's going to be far too hot and then, you'll reach into the freezer and after dropping a few ice cubes into the bowl, your mother will look at you oddly and ask: " Damn that Heloise ".  Now that I think about, I guess that's all I really did have to say.

        PART ONE:  "Whatever happens now, there is no turning back."  All too often, we hear these words and we think to ourselves: What is there to go back to?  What once was, can never again be. Whatever you had with someone, it cannot be repeated a second or third or even, a hundredth time over. It simply stands now as a dead-end street where you are only able to turn around and go back to the beginning. Back to where you started out and where you will seek to set things right for yourself.  No matter how much you miss the concept of what you two once had, it is not dead in the sense that it cannot be felt again but it will only matter if it is felt with someone new. The old skin is shed and there beneath is the transparent creature you came to know firsthand. Yourself.  Light pierces this transparent envelope that is the outer shell we all wear. It is this light that gives rise to reason and makes the difficult choices ahead seem that less darker than the ones we once thought were paramount to our survival years before. Sometimes this light comes from others. Friends. Loved ones. Family members. Spiritual guidance. Other times, it comes from a source that has no true name or definition. It simply is. Perhaps it remains anonymous for the sake of teaching us a lesson about what is truth and what is fiction. What is meant to endure and what is meant to fade with time.  The hardest road I've walked has been the one that I've walked upon while side by side with another person in my life. I would always be two steps ahead or one step behind. I sought only to safeguard myself. To run if I felt trapped. To hide if I were getting too close. Never reaching out. Never trying to hold onto that person for fear of what the light would not and could not show me at the end.  Loving yourself is always the difficult and most personal tasks we face. Loving another can be nearly as difficult but not impossible. So many times, personally speaking, I've come to love another more than loving myself. I guess it stands to reason that now, here when changes are about to come full circle once more in my life, that I am seeking to find the purpose in my OWN life. The reason to be ME. The definition of what I have to give to myself that cannot be taken from me by another. A chance to know what it is that I have sought to complete my inner-self for so many years now.  Is it a place, person or thing? An event perhaps? A part of the whole that the light has not yet touched?  ....so many questions remain.  A journey lies ahead of me. A journey where I will either succeed in the task at hand or...fall to the fears of what could have been made better. Hand in hand, I don't walk alone because I know now that I have friends, family and loved ones who have not abandoned me. They are still there; watching me go through life and hoping that at the end, I find whatever it is that I have been seeking to make myself whole and content.  Happiness eludes us when we dare to look behind.  That is the best and simplest way I can explain how I feel today.  PART TWO:  Last night, I had the chance to catch a scary movie. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The remake version. I literally jumped a few times off of the floor (I was lying there all curled up and feeling vulnerable while there in the darkness). I had seen the original years ago. But this one had some scary points that made me shiver. Surprise jolts of the unknown I guess you might say. Overall, I recommend it for renting if you have nothing else to do but plan a trip across Texas in the middle of summer and you find yourself off the beaten path (i.e. main highway, which I recommend you NEVER lose track of).  PART THREE:  Yesterday, I continued my search for the "perfect" apartment. Well, maybe not so perfect but at least: liveable? Not an easy task when so many places are mismanaged. Oh, the front part of the complexes look divine, safe and clean. But you drive around back and there waiting in the wings is a whole other story to be told.  The amount of rent is yes, important but there are many many other factors to consider. Safety. Convenience. The grounds. Maintenance. Lease incentives. The list goes on and on.  How will it feel to live on my own again after nearly twelve years of being a part of someone else's life? It will feel .... different. I cannot say just now what it will actually be like because to be honest, I don't know yet. I won't know until I get there and start restructuring my life. Not to say that my life is in disarray but ... it needs fixing. Repairs. Some assembling required. Some of you know of what I speak of. Some may not and of those, I envy you one and all.  As they always say though: Time will tell the tale.  PART FOUR:  My father's health has not been that great in recent days and weeks. Half of his heart is no longer able to receive the amount of blood it should in order to function properly. So, after much consulting and many tests, he is due to have bypass surgery in the next few days. There are many who have this type of surgery performed daily and survive years further. If he does not have this surgery, he's been informed that his life expectancy will be cut by two-thirds in the first 3 to 6 months and within a year, he would be dead. Nothing like a jolt of reality to make you decide on the correct and most suitable course of action.  Naturally, my mother is concerned. But then, so are the rest of us. Over time you become aware of your own mortality. You perceive that you have the right to live through whatever comes your way and then, a quickened dose of that mortality is given to you tenfold with a spoonful of medical boo-hah (aka jargon) and you start to take into consideration the pro's and con's of what lies ahead of you if you do not take the necessary steps to remedy the dilemma you face. In this case, it is the "heart" that is the matter.  Medical science has transcended the dark ages by leaps and bounds. We are a society that thrives on living longer and though we do not always succeed in this venture; we have the means to correct the abnormalities in us all. Living right. Taking care of our mental state and as the ole saying goes: eating an apple a day keeps the doctor away.  Personally, I prefer bananas and pineapples.  PART FIVE:  I need a vacation. I haven't been on a true to heart vacation in well over four years now. I think I need one to escape from the normalcy of the rat race we each face daily. I know that I need one to sort through some issues on a personal level. I can only hope that soon I'll be given that chance to take some much needed time off and from there, find a place in the corner of the world where I'll be served a mixed drink in the sand while watching the sun go down and just as the horizon treats to me a wonderment of illusion come alive, I'll let my toes touch the boundaries of salt water and I'll know one thing for certain: Life is good.  ~ G.

         My father's surgery was postponed until Monday. I decided to come down early and spend a few days with him and my mother. The doctor called today while I was here. He said all looked good and he would be looking forward to making sure that everything proceeded as planned regarding my father's bypass surgery.  My father seems at ease about it. Of course, if he has any apprehension, he wouldn't show it openly. But I can understand the fears he might have. Which is why I'm trying to be upbeat about this. And I'm his son. It's my chance to prove that despite the mistakes I've made and the choices in life that I have made, I remain more than just his flesh/blood. I remain an heir to his wisdom and adventures from years gone by.  I will of course let everyone know how things go on Monday. I return to work on Tuesday. That is, if everything goes well here with my father and I predict nothing but good news and a man with a renewed lease on life.  Beyond this, I've been furniture shopping for several days now. Last night, I managed to locate a bed. Also found another large but very nice mirror to add to my wall. I've never been a big fan of mirrors but of late, I've begun to accept that looking at myself in one will not cause it to crack and/or break. Funny to think that at my age, I still have/had concerns about my self-image but I guess living in the "gay" world, it's to be expected.  So many things are "good looking need only apply" type of routine. That's a sad and pathetic requirement but it's so very real.  And unfortunately, predictable in the manner of most gay men's lives but NOT all. One would think that after all we've learned and misplaced in terms of our judgement of others we would have discovered that looks are NOT everything. Some I guess will never learn. Others simply don't care. And still others are merely self-indulgent, oversexed feigns with the anticipation of manifesting their lust through the recesses of youth long after they have reached their "peak" in terms of age, beauty and sexual functions.  Okay, I won't preach tonight about something many of us already know about quite well.  As I finish writing this, I can only wonder upon my own life of late. What it is that I am seeking. What is missing and how do I find it.  The bigger question that lurks just around the next corner however is: Is the missing piece in my life searching for me as well....somewhere out there?

        Tonight, after work, I start making my way home.&nbsp; South Louisiana.&nbsp; My father is due to have bypass surgery sometime tomorrow morning.&nbsp;   For those of you who know me, you know the importance of family even if separated by time and distance.   I trust those out there will say a little prayer for his speedy recovery.   I know I will.   I will blog again soon to let everyone know how it goes.   Till then, I love you all.   ~ G.

         Today, I took some 'me' time and went to write. I took with me, my laptop. I wrote and I wrote (until the battery ran low on juice). I cannot say how long I wrote but it was enough time to know that I had a helluva lot to say and not enough time to say it all.&nbsp;         Perhaps that's why I've always hated that three word phrase: "to be continued".

        I'm exhausted.      Mentally and physically.      My father underwent surgery on Monday morning. Four hours later, he was in recovery. His vitals were stable and they moved him to an ICU room. When I left the hospital he was doing well. He hadn't woken up but his vitals were normal considering all that he had just underwent.      This evening my mother called. My father's blood pressure cannot stablize. And he's having some severe chest pains, she said. The doctors are watching him carefully.      Now I'm worried.      I'm trying my best not to think about it but it's rather difficult when you feel so helpless. So utterly helpless. Seeing him lying there in that hospital bed. All of those tubes entering every part of his body. Bags filled with whatever liquid that surely must cost a small fortune to process and administer dripped ever so slowly into his body.      My father's body.      My mother asked me to keep the faith and just go about my day and packing. It's hard though. But I'm taking her advice to "heart". No pun intended.      My day at work was unrecognizable to most prior days. Horrible. Long, drawn-out, and literally stressful despite my thoughts about running naked through a cabana-boy convention in the middle of paradise.      Poof! Dream over. Back to reality, Monkey!      That's my nickname for those of you who don't know. Monkey. And no, it has NOTHING to do with "spanking anything". Get your minds out of the gutter. Thank you.      I did however know someone who masturbated at least three times a day. Is that healthy?      I caught on to this "active habit" of his when I realized he shook hands more sternly with the "unused hand" and his confession, of course.      (Of course, that begs to option the thought: how did I know which hand he used? I'm assuming he was right-handed since he shook my hand with his left and he always held a cigarette with his right-hand hence ... blah blah blah ... I'm stopping while I'm ahead.)      I'm nearly packed though. Tony packed for me while I was gone. That was nice of him. I'll have to treat him to a special dinner or something to show my appreciation. Maybe a gift; something he likes?      My neck hurts though. I think the stress of the days gone by has reached its peak. It's inside of my neck muscles now. And I've not done any exercises in over a week now. There go my abs. Dammit.      Now if I just had a nice bubble butt.      See? My mind is running rampant on so many things that I can barely keep what I'm talking about on course with what I'm typing.  Out of order.  No coordination  .      This is what they might classify as "break neck speed". Luckily I don't do hurdles for anyone. Of course, I've been known to walk away from a fine piece of .... pie?      Thank you all for your prayers and continued get well wishes for my father. I am in your debt.      ~ G.
