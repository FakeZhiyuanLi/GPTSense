Today,which is friday,a national day celebration in school...early in the mornin,the whole school had to wait for that son of a bitch ViP....we've waited for about 30 mins where the sun began to rise and as usual...students complaint about the humidity...so hot lah,so sian leh...lah leh...kanina leh...haha...all sorts of bad words coming out from the Ite Amk's students...and as he arrived,we still haven't had our flag raising yet...and we all sang in such lazy manner...after the flag raising,that fucking ViP had to still give a speech and pass the msg from our principle of ite west...it sucks really...we had to stand so long as the sun was blazing so hot that even i started to complain...Nabe' teng teng...haha...after we were being realease from the parade square,we all were seperated into 3 places...one to the hall...second to the theatherette and third to the street soccer court...me and my gang were in the street soccer competition and were ready to play...we had a great start at first..beating the Digital Media Design(DMD) 4 goals to one...but in the semis,we lose 3 goals to one....i've scored two though and was happy with our performance...look on the bright side,we lost to a bunch of skillfull players...we were exhausted after that and went straight to the hall after we cool ourself down a little...          After we were being release from school, i went straight to tampines to see my lovely pwincess,Fizah...damn i miss her so much...i usually got to meet her twice in a week..but this time i understand her situation...got to see her once a week coz i want her to do really well for her prelims which comes around the corner..when i meet her at tampines stadium,i went smilin...she was gorgeous...she salamed me and we went to a nearby block to have a little chat for a while...bla bla bla...she got a religious class after that so she could not stay with me that long....3 pm sharp,we went to the bus interchange where we had our goodbye and she was damn sweet...she went home while i had to wait for the bus...and inside the bus...i went sleeping all the way to admiralty because...it was an exhausted and happy day for me....

He said...yer yer...haha...Me and suhaimi trailed them...we were like 15 meters apart...i could still remember she's wearin white and blue jeans... i thought i wanna surprise fizah that day but then she called...we had a big arguement about stuff that you guys can't know...sorry...to my dissappointment,my plan to surprise her was crushed...she last said...,"thats the end of our relationship..." She put down the phone after that....i was in complete silence....Suhaimi asked what the hell happened cause he could hear our unbearable conflict...i kept quiet for a while as we walked pass tampines mall...there was where my first tears went out...i chill for a while and day dream for mins and i decided to go home...i took the bus 969 as usual and in the bus...i kept thinkin of fizah and i cried real hard...not like babies lah...its just that my tears kept coming and coming out from my eyes...its a shame for a boy and a setan like me to cry,i know....but i could feel the pain that i gain from my heart...it was like...haizz....i dunnoe what else to say....that day,was my last day i saw Fizah....in white at tampines library....i was really really really really really heart broken...sob sob...
