      Well this is pretty much it for the travel Blog. Peggy and I are heading home. We are in Murdo, SD. With any luck we'll be home late Thursday night, or Friday morning. We had a great time. I hope everybody enjoyed reading this blog and looking at the pictures. If you did, tell Bob Vasquez thanks. He loaned me his laptop which made it possible to get the pictures ready for publishing here. I posted about 36 pages of Blog updates. They averaged about 3 pictures a page. You do the math. Thanks to everybody for commenting. I get a email eveytime somebody posts a comment, so I've read every comment you guys have posted. Champion Blog Commenter Award goes too... Steve Crandall for the most comments. One last picture from Roughluck Falls. See you next week.

      Peggy had been wanting to see Mount Rushmore since grade school. Today was the day she finally got to see it.    The ongoing Crazy Horse monument is pretty close to Mt Rushmore, so we visited there next. Did you know the construction of this is privately funded?     Here is a model of the sculpture

      Devil's Tower Legend There are several versions of this legend, but the go something like this.   According to a Kiowa legend, eight children once played here. One was mysteriously transformed into a bear. His seven sisters fled in fear across the eroded plains of northeastern Wyoming to a giant tree stump, which rose from the ground even as they tried to climb it. Clawing furiously, the bear tried to reach the girls but could not. The stump then turned to stone, preserving the giant gouges from the bear's claws. The sisters floated into the heavens, where they can be seen at night as seven bright stars.      There is quite a large parrie dog community around the tower. Peggy had quite a good time watching these crazy little guys.     We spen the night in Deadwood, SD. Rudy you'll be happy to know that local historians applaude the creators of Deadwood HBO for it's accuarcy. Also, did you know all the main characters were real people in Deadwood? We visited Wild Bill Hickocks Grave.

      Okay, everybody just settle down. I know you've been waiting for this report. Peggy assures me this was just fabulous. We got to Ralston just in time to see the mule parade. There were many different kinds of mules and riders. Don't worry, Peggy has the whole parade on tape. This is the biggest event of this type in the world. There were about 113 mules for auction, seminars, and a mule rodeo. You haven't lived until you've seen people trying to make mules barrel race. Here are some highlights.

      Okay, here we are in Yellowstone. Everything you have ever heard about the beauty of this place is true. Wildlife is everywhere, even in our campers village. We rented a cabin, and there was a pesky black bear that we seen a few times. One morning it was by the creek by our cabin. We watched a grizzly bear through binoculars, and seen three moose as well. Very exciting. About the only thing we didn't see were the wolves.    Old Faithful   Mamouth Springs area

      As soon as I finish this post Peggy and I head on to Yellowstone. We are in Bozeman, Montana right now at a Kinko's Copy center. We had a greta day in Bannack State park, Nevada City, and Virginia City All forming gold mining towns. There has been a lot of questions about the animals in the Tripple D posts. This animals are still very wild. They can be handled by their handler, but he has the utmost respect for them. It's not like they train them to sit and beg or something like that, but they are trained enough so that they to have some respect for the handeler. Then they take the animals out to some natural setting and turn them lose basically. I was standing in front of a 3 feet high chicken wire fence when I shot that Tiger. Pretty exciting really.  Peggy is seeing lots of mules and is looking forward to mule days on Saturday.  Well I better hit the road. Thanks to whoever took the time to help Wilbur look at this blog. I know what you went through. I am sorry.  Thanks for all the comments. -Ric & Peggy

      Bannack was one of the wildest of the wild West towns in Montana. Today it is a state park. They preserve the buildings, but don't make any attempt to restore them. It is a cool place. Here are some pics

      I did four posts tonight with pictures from the first two days. Somebody asked were I am at. I am in Kalispell, Montana. It's not a bad place. It's not the San Juan Mountains, but it ain't bad. If you post a comment, do me a favor and leave me your name. If you don't tell me who you are, I don't know who you are. Simple enough? Thanks. Eric, the flash trax unit is working great. You would like to do this.

      Okay as promised here are my pictures from the ranch. Well, not really all of them; I've taken about 3000 pictures since I left home.  The first animal we worked with was baby mountain lions and then the mother and the babies.      Here is the best picture I got from the wolf pack.     You gotta love baby raccoons.

      Day six or something like that I believe. I am sure the spelling in these posts are ghastly, but bear with me. I am in Kalispell, Montana. I found a coffe shop about 5 blocks away that has internet. Pictures tommorrow I promise. I've been in and around Glacier National Park for the last three days. There is still plenty of snow up in the mountains. Steve, not as much as we seen in Rocky Mountain National that time, but a lot. There are so many waterfalls here that is on believable. I've seen about a dozen mountain goats since I've been here and a couple of eagles as well. No pictures of either of them. I did get some pictures of some bighorn sheep today and a couple of elk also. We had our orientation for the seminar tonight. We had to sign a paper saying that if we get ate by the grizzly bear it's out own damn fault for being stupid, or soemthing like that. Can't wait to start shooting tommorrow. We are working with a couple of the better known photographers around, so it should be great learning experince.  Okay, get out your maps... Find St. Ignace... Find Kalispell... Look at highway 2... Pretty cool huh? Only one road to get here... Of course it's two thousand miles of one long boring road, but it gets you here. Any one reading this?

      Well, I finally got somewhere that I can log on and update this, although no pictures yet. I am in East Glacier, Montana. I spent about 4 hours in the park this afternoon. It was kinda of wet and gloomy, but I went on a couple of hikes and took a few pictures anyway. It is very beautiful here as one would expect. I have driven about 2300 miles since I left Fremont last Friday. I met another guy from Michigan here today that took highway 2 out here also. He sumed up the eastern 3/4's of this state in this manner, "I hate Montana. I don't ever want to see another blade of grass... ever." Now I   know where all that certified Black Angus Beef comes from, and yes unlike like my friend I just mentioned, I will eat it again. Bob, there are mexican resturants galore out here, so travel without fear. About the most interesting thing that happened on the way out here was in Wisconson. A bald eagle swooped down right beside the Jeep and grabbed up a mouse or some other rodent that was having a bad day. I also seen the grill that cooked the world's largest hamburger, and drove through the geographical center of North America. Don't worry, I have pictures! Tommorrow I move to my "permanent" spot, at least for a week. Hopefully I can find some internet hookup and upload some pictures. See ya.
