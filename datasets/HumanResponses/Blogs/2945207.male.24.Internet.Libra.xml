      as i move ahead on the road to glory, i see many things around me. happy faces that share my joy, participative faces that make me feel i am not alone, sad faces caught up in a world of their own, dreamy faces lost in their thoughts. everybody has a purpose in life, but i dont know how many are being able to fulfill it.   many of them dont know their purpose in life. they have not awakened to the guiding principle of their inner God, leading them to the tallest heights in life. they are just living like driftwood, going with the stream not aware of what may come ahead. they dont have a vision of life. and even if they have, its blurred. there are no goals, no aims, no objectives. its a life that they just live, rather they just exist. they are unaware of their existance. only believing to take instantaneous decisions. i pray for them.  some of the rest are bitten by the practicality bug. they just follow strict rules in life. not following a rule is a sin to them. they dont realize that their life is linked to lives of others. they just feel that they are right. and what they do is never wrong. they are very rigid and 'compromise' does not exist in their dictionary.  a few belive in the power of miracles. the endless possibilities that life has to offer. the vast horizons that one can traverse. they belive that they can reach the stars. they believe that there are no limits. they know how to follow their dreams, they know how to trust themselves, others and God. they know that life is a journey, not a destination. they are led by the power within. they are self-motivated. they drive themselves and others to glory. they also know that life is a combination of roles, where everyone has to play their part. no one can move ahead alone. they recognise others in their lives. they know the importance of their loved ones. they know how to love, and they know how is it to be loved in return. they are closest to their loved ones, and in turn closest to God.

      and they say you have to learn form life. well, life teaches you everyday, so many new things, so many new traits, so many new facts, so many experiences. you dont have to keep your eyes and ears open, you just be awake and you will learn. no effort needed, life makes it compulsary. you need to better yourself form every yesterday that passes. carefully sort out things and give it rational thought. and you will realise hoqw things work, how minds function, how things fall in place and out of place.  its so natural to become emotional, and turn yourself into a dumb fool. no one is here to take care of you. everyone has their own objectives. you need to work your way up the ladder yourself. dont wait for spoon-feeding. thats not going to happen. if someone is feeding you, they are eyeing something out of it. the pure-hearted are eyeing the satisfacion and the wicked are eyeing your trust in them. its up to you to recognise your allies and foes. blind trust is a thing of the past.  sometimes when you realize that you have been on the receiving side of all the worries in the world, you have no one else to blame, but yourself. its you who has allowed this to happen. no one can make you feel good or bad without your permission. you decide your life. you have the power of choice. your future depends on your past and present. everything that shines is not gold. its time you learnt this lesson. everyone claims to know this, but forgets this when its needed practically.  life always moves on, you have to move with it. you cant afford to be left behind. capitalise on the need of the day and mould yourself to adjust to the present. adapt yourself quickly. there is nothing constant except change. and there is nothing more intriguing than adapting to change. the one who realizes this will never fail. faith can move mountains, keep the faith!

      i have finally made the choice. i have crossed the bank and jumped over to the other side. from here, i can see lush green grass, swaying daisies and trotting horses. i can feel the freshness in the air, the aroma of peace. i can experience the joy of making the right choice and the satisfaction that makes my heart praise myself.  i have growing, every moment. i am turning into a better human being every instant. i am moving ahead every time i breathe. i am coming closer to my dreams, my visions of myself. the jigsaw puzzles are finally falling into place.  i was too confused, maybe because i was biased. now i feel i am lighter, happier, better, proud of myself. what i gained today was what i was eyeing since a long time. and it fell into my lap today, elevating me to a different level, a higher floor. i am now taller than i was before. i am climbing up, moving on, and making myself capable of handling everything that may come.  this journey is always going to continue. i am always going to keep moving. because no one can stop the man who knows where he is going.

      today is a wonderful day. the sky is bright and clear, and i can feel the gentle breeze against my face. i can hear the birds chirping and the flowers blooming. i see familiar faces all around, all smiling, all happy. i see small children with their mothers on their way to school. i see elders taking their scheduled walk in the garden. i see students off to college. how is it i did not notice any of this before?  life is undergoing a change, i feel. i am becoming sensitive to my surroundings then before. anything that happens around me catches my attention quickly. i find myself thinking about every small change that takes place near me. and the thought process does not leave me soon. it keeps revolving in my head. oh what is this? how did i start feeling this way? what caused this?  i find myself swaying in the wind. i feel thoughts shooting into my head. i see visions of the future or maybe the past. i see myself, happy and content, smiling and satisfied. i see my family, my loved ones around me. i see my parents, proud of me. i see my friends beaming on me. what is all this? is this the truth? am i dreaming? is this really possible? i dont know the answer to all these questions. all i know is, everything happens in its time.  history repeats itself, but not time. once gone, time never returns. its something thats designed for the moment. all we can have is memories. and that is the most valuable treasure that one can have. i have already started buiding up my treasure. everyday of my life is adding to my pile of treasures, the priceless collection that i will always have with me. i have no fear of losing it anyday, no matter what may come.  in hope i lay my dreams. cemented with confidence and trust, they are taking shape. that day is not far when i reach my goal. and that day, i can look up to God and tell him, "not a leaf moves without your permission, not a wind blows without your approval, all i am today is because of you, Thank you for all that you have given me. i will always remain indebted to you."

      was pleased with myself today morning. woke up with a fresh feeling and was feeling on cloud no. 9. yesterday evening was really good, patched up with my sweetheart. i felt i had lost her, but she was going nowhere. keeps coming back to me, no matter where i go. her smile can change everything on earth. no matter what mood i am in, the moment she smiles, i feel i am in heaven. she is my elixir of life. life seems to be incomplete without her and she is incomplete without me. if there is a time when i can feel its paradise on earth, its now. the twinkle in her eye is enough to illuminate my world and her rosy lips are enough to add all the color in my existence. when we are together its like sugar in milk, salt in water.  she is ultimate and her love is the loveliest.

      that she loves me is as pure as the purest gold. and that i love her is as true as the sun.  what is not convincing is that fact that love always brings happiness. there has not been a single day where there is no negative emotion linked to her name in my thoughts. no matter how earthly, humble or understanding i am, she is in her own world, thinking of her involvement in her activities and daily life. the distance between us is ever increasing and i dont see the day far when we both wont see each other.  life is not right. things are not what they seem to be. this is all a mirage. and it breaks down in front of you when you need it the most. its just a dream, and dreams always break when you wake up. they dont last long. life is this way. a life of expectations is a one full of sorrow. the happiest man on earth is the one with no expectations. and there is no man without expectations.   this just means that there is no happy man existing, and if he says he is happy, he is lying. he is lying to himself and to others, trying to hide the basic truth of life. life is not what you think it is. its something more, you and I can never get life in its entirety. all we have to do is pretend. and the one who can pretend well, can live peacefully. i hope.

      just recently i heard someone describe an ad on TV. the ad showed a small boy watching television. there was a documentary that showed a long queue of village folk waiting near a dry tap. everyone was eagerly awaiting the tap to start flowing. it was obvious that they were suffering due to water shortage and if anything could make their life better, it was water. the little boy turned around and saw his dad shaving in the bathroom. the tap in the basin was running full force. the boy ran up to the tap and turned it off. when he returned to his room, he saw that the people on television were happy, water had started pouring from the tap. there were big smiles across everyone's faces. it was such a happy feeling.  maybe the ad was a simple water conservation program. but it surely did its job. i started putting the tap off when i shaved, brushed my teeth. i started saving as much water as i could. if i knew i was going to drink only half a glass of water, i would fill only half a glass of water. i started asking guests how much water they would want and gave them exactly that much. they were impressed and started following the practice themselves. i saw that a small ad made such a big impact on me and my actions in turn made an impact on others.  it set me thinking, was i just waiting for an ad to start saving water? am i so lost in my life that i forget the basic things that i need to take care of? do i give things ample thought? am i being just to my friends, family and loved ones? i told myself that i needed to be more aware of the world around me. i started analyzing things more than i did before. i realized i was going far from my family just to come close to some temporary riches. i saw that i was not doing the things that i should be doing. i was straying away from my duties as an individual. i was running away from my responsibilities as a member of the society. is this what we call life?  all this starts a battle in my mind. i am caught up between whats right, whats wrong and whats my viewpoint. i fail to find the correct answer yet, i still keep thinking. maybe i will stumble on the best answer and accept it as the right one soon. i hope the day comes soon when life becomes organized. when people think about others also apart from themselves. the world will surely become a better place to live in.

       urlLink    ever wondered what these clouds mean? why they take up different shapes? and how each cloud is different, i have never seen two identical clouds ever. what is it that they portray?  i have never been able to figure that out. most of the times i see that a cloud closely resembles something i have seen elsewhere. like a human silhoutte, a shape familiar to me like a peek through my garden window. when ever i see something i have known, i break into a smile and keep staring at it to find more similarities. Is this God's way of telling us that life is a collection of happy moments and that we have to find the happiness embedded in his many creations.  the flow in which these majestic clouds move over places makes me want to be inside one of them and go with them, wherever they go. on top of everyone, i will be able to see what everyone is doing, how people are smiling back down when i wave to them from the clouds. that day i will surely be on cloud no. 9!  when you touch a cloud, you hand just passes through it and comes back with nothing but the essence of life, water. and thats how it is, no matter what we do, we have to accept that all the wonderful things in the world are basically evolved from the five basic elements of nature. and no matter how far we may go to duplicate them, the heart will find its absolute happiness when it is amongst the most natural surroundings.  i have never seen a face in the clouds yet. i have heard people speak about it though. maybe God uses clouds to allow people in heaven to see their loved ones on earth. and sometimes they peep out of the clouds and people manage to see them. i have yet to see such a phenomenon. are the Gods listening?&nbsp; urlLink
