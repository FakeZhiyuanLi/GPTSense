      just add another one to the zoo roster... a big fat female robin has recently completed her nest... right outside my kitchen window, in the cross beams of the upstairs apartment's deck... and *RIGHT* over top of my BBQ.  robin doesn't like me very much. whenever I go to use the BBQ, I get chirped at, and it doesn't really sound like a "hey, how YOU doing" chirp. It's more of a... "get the heck away from my nest" chirp.   but then robin gets annoyed when I don't leave, and flys away and sits in the grass until I go back inside.   I think it's only a matter of time until I get dive bombed by said robin.

      There is khaos in my life... and now there's also reason.  Today my mom called, and said "I'm not encouraging you, but I'm at this place and they have free kittens. I'd rather you take a free kitten instead of paying another $100 for another kitten"  And that was that.  reason is grey & white with a (currently) black nose. He has four white paws, and he and khaos have been playing for over an hour now.  reason was born about April 1, which makes him almost exactly a month younger than khaos.    I am no longer part of the entertainment in this apartment. I will try to post some pictures on the weekend for you.

      I made a doctor's appointment today to deal with what shots i need to get... except the woman at the doctor's office was so completely UNHELPFUL. She actually told me to go call my travel agent and find out what type of shots I need. Nice attitude, for a health care provider.  I checked out the stuff for the conference (ask me via msn and I'll send you the link) and it turns out that I am supposed to be giving a 45 minute presentation on two separate occasions. Or so it looks. Charming.

      Well, just got back from the Skar and found out today that I am (for sure) going to brazil in june. for a week... all expenses paid (well, I have to pay for two extra nights accomodation, but air and accomodation are already paid).   I don't know where I am staying, what the hotel will be like... don't even know what to pack. I just know that I have to be part of one seminar (I have to actually talk... UGH) and I have to attend my boss' other seminar... other than that, he said I could probably sneak off one of the days of the conference.  As well, there is a day at the end for all the participants to go on tours/etc. I knew I was sticking around at this job for some reason...

      I made it to G'town...  finally. :/ That was some pretty nasty weather!  I got like 1/2 way when it got really bad so I just decided to take it slow and come home...  yeah... Fog + heavy rain + dark = not so nice driving...  especially off of the highway on the side-ish type roads :/

      last night i must have been thinking about not wanting to go back to school before bed... i had a dream about being late for class, then getting to robart's and not being able to find my classroom... of course the staff at robarts were horrid and un-helpful, and i almost lost my packed lunch. when will the insanity that is school end?  [edit from several hours later] my grades came in today... apparently they haven't kicked me out yet. *sigh* i can hope for next term, right?

      in the morning, after being locked out of my room for the better part of the night, khaos is in supreme attack mode. he pounces around my bed, jumping on me... and purring his little furry brain right off. it's hard to take him seriously when he's intent on pouncing on me, but purring like that.

      Today was another long day! Sight-seeing tour at 9 am (at least I could sleep in a little) and then went to check out a little craft-market... bought some interesting stuff... hit the mall... had McD's - cheeseburger (yes, tastes the same but the salt on the fries is different)... checked out the pool... cold. Went swimming anyway. Then went back to the south pier again... got some beautiful pictures of the area, then went on a spending spree in the surf shop there. Bought lots of things I didn't need to buy... hit the same restaurant as last night for some food... then cabbed it back to the hotel, went back to the mall... Now am very tired, but since some people from the conference have left me two messages since I left earlier today, I have to wait for them to come back again (shortly)...  I just got a call that said I am going on a day-trip tomorrow to a small town outside of the city... should be interesting... now it sort of feels like a vacation, but I've been doing so much I barely have time to sit down!

      Well, the conference is finally over. Don't get me wrong - it was a great experience and I met some very interesting people... but when some of the students who were helping to organize/run the conference asked me yesterday if I wanted to go out with them last night, the answer was a very fast "YES".  It was so nice to get out and see a little bit of the city, and not have to think about work.  We went to a part of the city called Pontao. I can only describe this as "tropical, but without the sand". It was on one side of a man-made lake, and it was beautiful. I didn't get to take too many pictures because I was trying not to be too touristy, but I think I would like to return there today (in the daylight!).   Plus, the currency conversion is very favourable here... one "real" (their currency) is about .44 of a Canadian Dollar... I think I will go shopping!  time for breakfast!

      I have just sat through a twenty minute presentation on a topic that I actually know something about. And the authors made some very, *VERY* scary assumptions to base their work on. It not only annoyed me, it frightened me. They had a period for questions. Normally, I´m content to keep my mouth shut, but today I had to say something. I made a very valid point, speaking from extensive experience, and they, like most academics, really didn´t seem to get my point. ´Twas ever thus. They´re still wrong. Maybe someone else will explain it to them in Portuguese, because I was *very* clear in English... What´s scarier than their error though, is the fact that *I* picked it out right away... and it started me thinking: wow... I could write a paper so much more accurately on this topic than they have. (and someone would probably feel the same way about my presentation... vicious cycle!)  Someone shoot me now. Before I become one of them.

      i am in brazil... i am trying to figure out how to learn how to say no ice! in portuguese. haven't got it yet. gave my first presentation this morning, it wasn't too bad... but the simultaneous translation into portuguese makes it a little weird - and it's hard to answer question when your little translator radio isn't working...

      Today it was announced that not only will I have to drive to Toronto three times this week in order to pick up the visas for my trip (which I thought was already taken care of), I also have to pay to register for the conference... it's only 180 EUROS, and it HAS to be paid by VISA credit card... of course I have a visa... but i never activated the card because I don't use it.  So tomorrow: drive to my parents to activate the card and fax the registration form.  It's okay, I'll get the 180Euros back as soon as I receive my credit card bill... of course who knows how long the school will take to pay me back and i'll have to cover that bill before they give me the money...  What else is new.  Like i said... how do you spell that word, the one that expresses disgust, stress, annoyance... all rollled into one HEY it's 10:20 and I'd rather be sleeping sound...

      Is it anti-social, or even "high maintenance" to refuse to leave the confines of your cool, air conditioned basement apartment, and to demand that anyone who wants to see you show up there, when it's this hot and muggy outside? What if I am in here, with the temperature around 12, wearing wool socks and a sweat shirt???

      Yes, they changed my flight itinerary. Now I actually have connecting flights that I should be able to make... but the hotel room isn't booked. I hope to make that happen tomorrow.. wish me luck.  It's 10 pm... that means that my kittens have just woken up. They only napped for about half an hour before I woke them both up and tried to get them to play. But for some reason, that half hour nap between 9:00 and 9:30 is enough to keep them going until the wee hours of the night... they prefer to wrestle on my bed while I'm in it.

      there have been several plans over past weeks for obtaining a "cat tree". partially because I object to my computer chair (which has a nice high back) being used as a cat-climbing aparatus. I also object to it being a vertical cat-wrestling arena...  tonight I went to my parents and my mom and I made a "cat tree". a very simple one. plywood bottom & top, 4x4 "trunk", scraps of carpet. Brought it home. It's about 4 feet tall. Got it out of the car. Set it down on the driveway too hard and screwed the bottom up. I guess two of the screws didn't go right into the 4x4. Brought it inside, of course I don't have a drill or appropriate nails to stabilize the base.  Two bungee cords around the pillar in my kitchen did the trick.  But what I want to know is:  How do you bring a foreign object like this into an apartment and the kittens know IMMEDIATELY how to scale it and get on the top?  And if they got up there... why can't they get back down?  The height scares them a little (For the climbing down) so there's a temporary chair beside it now for dismounting.   But then again... khaos just ran into the patio door with his head. eek... need i say more?

      well... I am safely back from the travel doctor. My arms aren't hurting *too* much yet, but it's only been an hour... I am now immunized against:  Yellow Fever Hepatitis A Typhoid Fever Tetanus (Psst! You're all due for this if you haven't had it recently!) Diptheria (Psst! You're all due for this if you haven't had it recently!)  I'm still fair game for any regular flu bugs though. I didn't get a flu shot this year and they were out of them at the clinic.  Four needles. $260 including the $50 consultation fee.  That, and there's very little I can eat or drink while I'm there... nothing but bottled water (even to brush my teeth), no fresh fruit or vegetables unless boiled or peeled, no raw meat or seafood (right, because I was going to eat raw meat anyway... LOL) I still have no idea if I can get any of the money back through my health insurance... We shall see :)

      fly to NYC first day, 2h 45min layover fly to sao paulo (south of actual destination), arrive 5:15 am second day catch connector flight to brasilia on first day at 9am  on the way back... fly south to sao paulo (day one of flight)... arive at 11:50am fly sao paulo to miami... leave at 11:55pm catch connector flight home several hours later   i was going to plan on practicing a little magic to make that connector flight to brasilia, since i will arrive at the airport a day AFTER the connector flight leaves.  then i was planning on learning guitar and busking at the sao paulo airport for TWELVE hours on the way back.  and my boss wonders why I wanted the "DETAILS" of the flight itinerary this early... i know they won't change the 12 hour layover, but um, like i said... that flight from sao paulo to brasilia is going to be a little hard for me...

      On the weekend, someone stole the lady upstairs' garage door opener from her van.... now she thinks that the person is going to try to come back and open the garage door and come in and try to break into the house. So... we are going to have to lock the front door at night. She's going to get a new remote for the garage door opener, but it bothers me because it's a pain in the ass to have to worry about locking & etc... Plus, now I'll have to lock my patio doors too... it's too bad we can't just let malcolm run free in the house...

      It is amazing how well these things go together.  It is starting to get a little frustrating though...  I have watched season 4 up to episode 8...  then I'm screwed. I was able to download episodes 18 and 21 but the rest I am having absolutely no luck finding...  does anyone out there that reads Jen's blog know where I can get season 4 episodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, and 22 (I remember you saying that you had the last one Jen so that one I really don't need I suppose.)  I have tried on Kazaa but as soon as I start to download the other people cancel....  what is with that??? See this is only a problem because I want to watch the ones I have (18 and 21) but you see I don't want to spoil the episodes before it because I know that I will get them eventually. :) o.k.... If you have em or know someone who does PLEEEAAAASEEEEE  let me know...  I need something to feed my boredom!

      So I've worked a variety of shifts before but never actual shift work.  Let me tell you people that have not had this wonderful experience for yourself...  it sucks.  My mind is so messed up I don't know when it is day and when it is night or wether or not I should be awake or asleep or tired or not.  Time or day, sun or moon, light or dark...  doesn't matter.  I just worked 3 nights (11:30pm-7:30am) then one day off then 1 day (7:30am-3:30pm) then 3 evenings (3:30pm-11:30pm) then one day off then 1 night (11:30pm-7:30am)  my mind is in a muddle!   I like my new job a lot.  It is very interesting.  Everything was going great up until my shift tonight when...  some crazy bastard threw up on my desk...  the joys of working in health care :(
