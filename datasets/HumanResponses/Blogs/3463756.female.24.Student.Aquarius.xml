      So I have been a beach lover all my life. Despite the rather excruciating pain in my tooth, I was game for a day at the beach. Knowing K and his (sometimes irritating) eye to detail we got all packed and all for a casual day at the beach with his friend. And what happens? It rains on our parade!  We left late. Ok, my fault. But I do happen to think that speaking with my mom is marginally more important. And when we finally reached we had a rather long drive to the beach. Getting down from the car, I nearly froze my a** off but K and his friend decided we should go for a walk. Not a bad idea but it was so windy, and after walking for what felt like miles against the wind, I felt like calling it a day. So we get in the car again. Going to lunch, my travel sickness decided to put in an appearance, so I spent half the journey on my cellphone talking with my friend, with my head between my knees, so as to distract myself from the rather "uprising" sensation in my throat.  Lunch was a grand affair and one of the highlights I considered for the day. After that scrumptious experience (despite the tooth), we decided to go to the friend's place, during which time I blissfully took a short nap.  Blah blah blah, the rest of the day was uneventful. oh I should mention for dessert what I had was a cake, warm from the oven with rich chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream on top. That truly was the main event of the day. The sea was a washout. The journey to and fro was nice and comfy with me and my babe, not squabbling for a change but nice and snuggly instead. comme ci, comme ca. That's what the day was like...

      Last night, I developed a pain in my newly emerging wisdom tooth. I took a pain killer, but it offered just temporary relief. But this morning I was game anyway for my day at Central Park. I didn't expect much out of it, hey a Park is a park right?  no way is Central Park just a Park. I walked and I walked till my legs felt like they were going to drop off but I just wanted to go on anyway. I went to the zoo, to the fountain and here and there and still managed to see just half of it. I have got to go again!  Did I mention K was there too? Well he was and I had the most wonderful time because of him. Well he did manage to bug me with his penchant for taking the best photographs. I mean shouldn't I get a better view since I am on the scene rather than move so that he can stand and capture the moment on film rather than me in my mind? But maybe in retrospect- his memories might last longer than mine. zoos are a lot of fun and I remember the last time I went to a good one was about 12 years ago when I lived in Hyderabad. My mom used to tell me the monkeys missed me when I didn't visit there in some time. But I loved it and I cant believe how many memories that Central Park zoo brought back. The reptile house, the bird smell, even the stupid monkeys! All that was missing was the smell of those god awful greasy smashes that I insisted on eating there. What keeps the animal couples together? Perhaps a certain sense of attachment, a certain instinctive knowledge that things are right. What keeps human beings from having that same knowledge? Is it that our instincts have been misted by our learning of 'civilized' behavior? I really cant say but its clear that we cant ever truly say honestly that is that this is "right" and be absolutely certain. Reason always pokes up its voice and says "are you sure?" and you know what? You never are...

      I see its been a couple of days since I last wrote. Not that I forgot or anything, just that I have either been occupied or occupied. Saturday I finally went to the Indian area around this place. Funny how us Indians a colonized race have managed to make our own colony here. Kind of ironic even. The street is a wierd mix. Its a bit like one of the lower middle class areas to shop back in India and yet the crowd is a strange one comprised of those that would be at the places where I shopped. The clear cut class difference vanishes in a country like this I guess. You tend to lust after stuff that back in India you probably might not even have thought twice about. Who would have thought I could become mad about Indian groceries and Hindi movies after leaving India when I wouldn't even glance at them back in India?! That's the strangest part. But then I can say that back in India K and I didn't so much as glance at each other in 'that' way either.  I guess you begin to look at things differently when you don't have them anymore, when u have to stop taking things for granted. Perhaps then, those are the times when you would stop being blind and actually begin to see things that were right in front of your face, the whole time.

      I wake up this morning to find that I couldn't see the next building too clearly, and no I wasn't going blind, but it was very very foggy outside. Being at my boyfriend's house, one has a clear view of Manhattan. But this morning, it was obscured by all that smog. I finally saw him off to work (ok so he went reluctantly but I assure you I did not have anything to do with his reluctance!) and got down to the serious business of chatting online with my mother.  After yesterday's cooking disaster, I have decided that I am going to make a meal of which one can be proud and lo and behold, here comes another obstruction. If it says beans and Sauce in a can, why doesn't it simply have beans and sauce? The variety that I have at home is supposed to be beans and sauce and instead it has a bunch of other stuff like ham sauce and oregano and what not.. looks like I need a new lunch menu. Of late I notice most of my conversations seem to revolve around the kitchen area. Cooking, cleaning, and other housewifely chores. Could I be turning into one of those horribly boring woman who can talk about nothing but that? I know several woman like my mom and so on who are housewife but by any standards cannot be termed boring. I just hope I turn out like the latter and not like the former who are horribly tedious to be around.  Sometimes I wish I could just give this all up and go back home. To my safe little cushion where I have no responsibilities and so on. Then I remember that irritated me too. So I guess I better just see what the future has in store for me... for now that also includes what to do about dinner.

      Somehow a day keeps getting better and better. Look at yesterday and the day before. Yesterday was my Babe's birthday..(much as I hate to be that cliched, its the most natural thing that comes to me while addressing him..). The night before, I baked him a cake. A chocolate cake with chocolate icing, albeit out of a box and a tin but hey, it was still a cake. And it turned out good. But the same day, I got news that my car in India was sold. That car meant a lot to me. My dad's first car, it's has been there, my whole life in India at least. And now its gone to someone else.      Then yesterday, K's B'day. It was a big deal. I mean its not everyday a person turns 25. But again I felt depressed about the car and just before going out, we have a fight about my clothes. We finally do go out and what happens? The restaurant closes early that day! We have to eat and run.      Then I drink a little more than I expect and it goes to my head. On top of which I take medication for allergies which means, I fall into deep sleep.   What do you do when u cant get up in the morning? What I do is just go back to sleep. Until the phone begins to ring that is. Then u drag yourself out of bed and try to face that aforementioned new day. And what happens? Just another round of disasters.    You find, that the kitchen is overrun with cockroaches, big and small. You manage to gather the enthusiasm to try something new for dinner, which blows up in your face and stink up your kitchen till you feel sick to your stomach. And you realise you might have done something to your boyfriend's computer. All in all, a new day isn't always the best thing to happen to you... Lets see how this one ends anyway...

      The first day of anything is pretty boring I think. A big let down after all the buildup of anticipation. This blog fulfils a need in me. A need to cure my life of its current state of boredom, of having nothing to do and to bore my friends perhaps with every tiny detail of my thoughts. I think it's gonna be fun anyway...

      Renuka, my sis stands first in her department. What can I do about it? Nothing. Just think about when I last got that excited about something I did academically. But just now, bro-in-law comes in and asks to see my bloc. Again. For the nth time, I said no. But these are the only remnants sometimes I think of being somebody who wrote stuff that other people liked to read.

      I don't know why but today I think of home. I wish I could be there. I can see myself asleep in my grandmother;s house in Bombay. Just lying there with the ceiling fan whirring away, reading the collection of books that we leave behind there. That house will always remain special to me. renuka came home from the hospital from there, I knew each and every person that lived there, ran around the building, played silly games and bonded with parts of my family there. It's part of family folklore.  But like everything else in my life, it no longer is what it was. The house belongs to someone else, my grandparents live elsewhere. I could go back to India but life just wont be the same. And I just miss it so much. It sometimes just feels like there is nothing that I could just hold on to. My home is going to be empty. I live in a country that is not mine and I go back 'home' to a country that will never be mine. And I just think and feel like crying when it all is so clear to me in my mind and yet not real anymore. The way it used to be. The way things I hold dear are no longer the same.  K cant begin to understand what I talk about. Rune does. But points out that home is now the place which I hold in me. Its where I feel at home. And for the most part that's true and that's what I hold on to. But sometimes, just sometimes I wish I could hold on to something tangible that is going to be permanent.  Perhaps then I could feel that my life is not just a blurry set of images whizzing by. Maybe then it will all come into focus and I could move with it. For now though I just feel that it is me that stands still while everything whirls, too fast for me to hold on to it. I wait for when I will be able to grab on to it.

      I went for the F1 race. A first for me. I stayed in a motel. Another first for me. And I took a road trip with K. Another first.  A trip like this will always be memorable. Why? Because it just had a series of first for me. First, I went on a road trip. A small first, I ate spam sandwiches. P couldn't tell what the big deal was. How do I explain that what I grew up on, a steady diet of Enid Blyton and the way kids in that lived was my most ultimate fantasy and was whom I wanted to be. I wanted to go be the Famous Five or sale on the Ship of adventure with Philip, Dinah, and the other two. Its part of the folklore I grew up with and cooking over a small fire is part and parcel of that.  But back to the trip. I took off with K. The two of, drove all night and finally after a small mishap that didn't turn out to be that serious, we reached Indy the next day morning. I slept. He went to the races. Mismatched pair! I went for the race. He was right, I did kind of enjoy it. It was different. 73 laps, and 20 cars. The best in the world. And all right in front of me, going round and round in circles. That's the part I don't understand. Racing must have been invented by some guy that was lost. A woman for sure would not invent a sport that involves going round and round a small track 73 times! Hey I said I enjoyed it, I never said I understood it. tired when I got back. Again K went off to work after driving all night. That guy draws out the last dregs of stamina and just manages to keep going. I don't think I could. And for sure I don't willingly do. But I love him and that's all. I didn't say I understood him either.

      Well it's hot hot hot here in New Jersey and that is my only excuse for not blogging as much as I ought. Had some good and some bad days in the interim. Life with K continues pretty much the same with the fighting, the making up and the adjusting that is required of two people who live together and who are so different in their tastes and lifestyles.  and now we have K's Bro-in-Law. Technically he is not his in-law as yet, may never be if things go the way they do with the legal system being what it is and all that. But my bro-in-law (well he might be,I don't know but it seems simpler to call him that for now)and his 'partner' were to be here for summer for a month. Instead sus couldnt come and just P came by. It was kind of awkward to begin with. Truth be told it still is to some extent. After all, being an Indian and not having dealt with someone so at ease with his sexuality its a little different and difficult especially when said person and I are the only ones at home most of the time. so with K working and me at home playing Suzy Homemaker,and P helping me out, I really don't know where I am headed. Life seems kind of hazy at the moment. As if the heat is making all reality shimmer somewhat. Maybe I should blog more about this. I know this cannot be the most clear thing I have ever written.

      Somedays it just doesn't pay to get out of bed and get up and start your day. I have been having a couple of days like that lately and I just don't see myself continuing this way. Used to be that I was one kind of person earlier. Sure, circumstances and time change a person but lately it seems like I have just had a personality transplant. This whole week since Monday, I have been doing nothing. Nothing that I would consider useful. No contribution to the world and certainly, no contribution to the success of my own life and future.  First my tooth; with the onset of wisdom there is pain and I think that's a fact. With learning there is always pain. No pain, no gain. That's what they say and that's what life is all about; paining and gaining. And so on a philosophical note, it seems that with my wisdom tooth making its appearance its making itself felt as well. Love is not easy. Sure at first, its all roses and enthusiasm and all those hormones running amok. But, I think you shouldn't forget that hormones too have a shelf life just like all medication. Hormones dry up and roses die. Love has its day too. It can die and it can dry up. I think what you have to is try and prevent that. What can you do to prevent that? I think you could deal with it with a large dose of patience and think maybe of the reasons that took you down this particular path in the first place.  What took me down this particular street with K was first that comfort zone that I achieved with him. Leading a life that isn't always peaceful, you tend to appreciate the comfort and peace of mind that you can manage to snatch, much more than when you are younger and more stupid. Sure my hormones surged, bells went off in my head and my heart told me to turn tail and run at first. Or even just ignore the bells. But then I sat and thought about the regret. regret that if I didn't try what promised to be an entirely new experience, I would look back and think on what might have been. But now I think about it the other way. What if I hadn't gone down that road and just had in my imagination all the lovely things that might have been abed that could be. Then I wouldn't see the pain at all. That's what you have to wonder whether your imagination is what makes possibilities more attractive and whether in reality some things are best left to one's imagination. previously I saw that love just wasn't enough. Sometimes two people in circumstances wrong for them just cant make it work. On the other hand maybe sometimes two people in the right circumstances might not be able to make it work either. Wait and see... That's all I can do right now.

      I never wanted to be old befoe my time. But right from the time I was a child, my grandma always said I was born old. Maybe I was but I definitely didn't think so. I know I never felt carefree and light without any cares or worries. Does that mean I was old? Maybe it did.  today I realized for sure that I am officially an old woman. An old, nagging woman.  I know I never used to be the nagging sort earlier on. In fact I really didn't care what the other person did or said. I am fairly easy going I believe. I know that. So then why is it that now the smallest things bother me?!  that's what I really don't understand. Whenever K refuses to take my opinion on something I tend to take it personally. Maybe he means it that way, maybe he thinks I am incapable of thinking and acting independently. But the way it comes across to me atleast is that he really does not think what I think counts for much. I know he definitely does not think that anything I do measures up to his irrational standards.  So why do I continue to try to measure up to these standards? I gave up trying to fulfill any expectations a long time ago. I knew I had to follow my own path and ignore what other people thought about me. I learnt a long time ago that it is impossible to keep everyone happy. And finally I learnt that if I kept trying to make other people happy I just made myself miserable. I think that I could be headed for misery. Oh Lord how can someone or something make me as happy as possible and as miserable as possible? Is this what love is to with? &nbsp;

      Two days ago I was down in the dumps. I spent a couple of days bursting into tears at the least provocation. My sis who wanted very badly follow a certain path is being prevented from doing so by circumstance. My dad,who lives in a place not many people go to voluntarily,(but where he went voluntarily because of his desire to see both me and my sister get what we want) is now having a rather rough time of it. And my mom who feels her hands are tied by us all is depressed. Add to that I feel guilty that I am not that miserable here and far away from the rottenness that prevails around the place where I lived.  but then I spoke with my dad. Probably one of the few times in life where I actually had an honest open conversation with him. Probably I think due to the fact that the conversation was not about me. He wrote a very nice email to my sister who felt happy again and so the chain goes on. The bluebird of happiness had made its rounds...  but why is it that most people are unable to empathise with other people effectively? I see people in one way, mostly in shades of grey. So I never can understand why others see in only black and white... Am I so different from other people that I see things differently than they do and that its easy for me to place myself into the other person's shoes?

      I always knew I have a lot of friends. But ever since I went to the reunion last weekend I realized that a lot of people out there really care about what goes on. Life makes you cynical. Lots of people go all out to get you and then every now and again, someone does something nice, a friend calls you out of the blue or something and that one small thing can restore your faith in mankind. I went to the reunion not expecting too much. I expected some awkwardness, some sort of acting 'clannish'. Well surprise, there was nothing like that. Despite not knowing some of them, it was good. Felt good and comfortable. So it wasn't an exciting time, (though Mariam was excited) but it was more a feeling of people at ease with themselves and with the others around them. Things have changed. There is no doubting that, people have matured, some more than others but the feeling is still of people who needn't chatter nervously to ease discomfort. It was of people just fitting in with one another like an old jigsaw puzzle that has been completed a lot of times. Going to my neighbor's house for the night, well that was a little uncomfortable I admit. But that was just because I cant really communicate with them. That was the only problem. But when auntie replaced some of the stuff I lost, I knew that here they were, another set of people that cared. even Mariam's hubby. Why I had him painted as a villain I don't know. But really the guy isn't that bad. Okay, so he has a whole bunch of quirks but even he loosened up. I appreciate that he made the effort and made Mariam happy. That's what the weekend was all about. Happy people.

      Finally the day arrives. I see people I haven't seen for 13 years. Not that I even knew some of them that well or for that matter even at all but even so.. I spent a lot of time anticipating this reunion. I left hyderabad at a time when everything was good. The move affected me. It affected my best friend. In some ways it altered my life course even. But it taught me one thing, that u may move and so on but people who want to be friends will find a way. The relationship continues. It may be altered, but it continues.  I went to meet my best friend and spend time with her and my other close friend. She didn't turn up, but my best friend did. Case in point, she would do anything she can for me when I need, just the way I would for her.  I enjoyed the weekend. We cooked, we ate a lot! And we talked quite a bit. NAS is getting married next year. The guy she wanted. So good things do happen to those who wait. It's the waiting in itself that tears you up inside.  &nbsp;K, I must confess, has to put up with quite a bit from me. The poor dear missed me a lot over the vacant. I hope when the time comes for me to leave he is able to bear it... He was so happy when I returned...  More photos coming up from the weekend.. But that's a job I will do a little later.

      Its impossible for two women to be friends without a hint of jealousy or something akin to it coming into the relationship. But its perfectly possible for two strange guys to bond and become pals without so much as a hint of envy in it. Even if the envy is there, it is hidden. Its just strange.  with the day's bit of wisdom having been expressed, it's time to chronicle the weekend's events. Albeit a bit late. But still. I forgot to take my camera with me but I have the pictures in my head. I hope they stay there. K says he liked Kent. The quiet appealed to him. Actually I like the part about it being quiet. It's only the inaccessibility that I have a problem with.  Moving to a new place is a scary thing when you think about it. But this time I think its more. I mean staying as a paying guest has its perks but I think it would also have its disadvantages.&nbsp;two guys and another girl. Sure the guys seem helpful but who knows. My landlady seems ok but again who knows. She may&nbsp;morph into the wicked witch of the east later on.  and then of course we have my ex-flatmates. Rashmi was ok. We had our differences but we moved past those and we remain friends. But what&nbsp;about the others. All I say is, the less said the better especially since at the moment all my stuff that's lost still has to make a reappearance.  Women don't like one another. The simple fact of the matter. &nbsp;

      What hurts more? Knowing your best friend is in love with you and not loving him or her back, or knowing that they aren't and you are? I don't know, but lately I cant seem to tell whether its better knowing that K is in love with me or whether it would have been better for the both of us that this didn't happen. Don't get me wrong I don't regret it. I just think about the hurt that might come along. The hurt of loving too much or too little. The inevitable hurt.

      Now I can breathe a sigh of relief... K found what he had lost. It had been plaguing me for a couple of days and now he found it. Ok so he got in a bit of hassle before that but he still didn't have to go through the hassle of going through Indian bureaucracy in another country where pull doesn't matter and you become totally at their mercy... Oh life is good. I should really pray now. Amen to that.

      As one knows, the popular saying goes, family.. Cant live with em, cant live without em... And the other one states that you can choose your family as you can your friends. So when I say family, or think of it, I mean the people I have chosen to consider as such.  I come from a large family, that every now and again I miss a lot. My grandmom has six sisters and all of them eccentric. She also has four brothers who contribute to any dearth of eccentricity. With their children and their children, we have a huge contribution to the planet in terms of eccentricity.  I know I got the same gene. K tells me that all the time. To me however anyone that uptight and sober has got be a little crazy. So I just let him think what he wants. atleast he doesn't think I am boring.  but I miss them and talking to them seldom makes it worse. I don't even know when I would see them. Now my other parts of the family which aren't so nice, all I can say is I choose not to consider them as even a part of my family. They are the ones whose existence on this planet is meant to be ignored and which I happily do.  and then those I choose. My friends. Another contribution to this planet's eccentricity. These are the people I love, who love me and without whom, I would just shrivel up and die. Its hard for some people to understand this but that's the way I am. The people in your life, make you who you are and make your life unbearable or worth living. (depending on the way you feel about them obscures)

      Yesterday I decided to go through my inbox. Just to explore it a little and I came across an old email. Well actually it was a draft of an email that I had sent to my ex-boyfriend. Suddenly it all came rushing back. How much he meant to me, how we used to be (ok so we are still good friends), and how things have changed from what they used to be. Last time this year I was in my own house, which is no longer the way it was. Everyone is getting ready to leave it too. When I left I had a really touching scene with my ex. I cried all the way on my flight. I knew nothing would be the same ever again. And boy was I right!  suddenly look at me. My best friend teases me about me not letting him in my home a few years hence. He asks me whether K minds that he calls and hogs my time. I was angry at that but I began to think. Have I really become that narrow now? Have I forgotten my best friends? Do I want to continue like this? And my answer is a big resounding NO!  I like having my friends. I depend on them and being with K is nice but I cant give them up. Its like its two different parts of me and both are necessary for my life. yeast K lost his passport. Well he lost it sometime ago but realized it yesterday and all of a sudden it got too much for me to handle. Suddenly I realized that nothing was going the way it was supposed to. I wasn't supposed to be with K. I planned my life another way. Everything I think my life is going to go a certain way, something seems to happen. I wonder if its a hex that someone put on me. Probably the Batwoman back at home. I just hope its not contagious. K seems to have caught some of it though. Poor guy losing one's passport and supporting documents is a very big deal. I have suddenly begun to pray. I think its when you think you have been hexed that you hope someone higher than the hoaxer will come and save you.

      What do you do when another man tries to pick up your boyfriend? K seemed to think I should feel insulted. Me, I didn't think Io. i believe that  guy was attracted to my boyfriend, but so what, he comes home with me anyway. I would think I would be worried if he decided to go with the guy instead but since that didn't happen, I figure there is no need for worry.  Christopher street was a bit of a revelation. I expected a lot of gay people, but I guess I didn't expect it to be so in your face. I don't know why not, I guess maybe it was just a mistake on my part. K was a little shocked I think, he wanted to hold on to me tight, but they tried to pick him up anyway. Ha ha. Fetish stores, cheesy t-shirt stores, bars and tattoo stores all jostle for place. Enter a bar and what do you see? A man dancing on stage, cleverly concealing his you know what, and yet the audience holds its breath hoping that somewhere somehow he will drop the towel(or whatever he is using for concealment) and they will all get to view. The dancer was good though and I had a good time.  Its a humbling experience for a straight girl to go into a gay bar. You get the feeling you aren't worth much. You could walk in naked and noone would care much except perhaps some nice guy would ask whether you were cold. For the most part though you feel like you might just be a part of the furniture. On the other hand, its the safest place to be if you want to just walk in, have a drink and sit and watch the nice eye candy around you without the resident creep coming over and chatting you up. No need to wonder if you are dressed appropriately or anything. No snide bitches to pass remarks on your dress sense either. It's an experience.. One I don't regret having.  Fourth of July. Independence day. Looking back at other independence days back in India I remember quite a few. In my school days I remember having to go to school, marching and preparing for flag hoisting, in my college days, it became another holiday, one on which dad was home too. But here its an altogether different feeling. Maybe it was cog we went to NYC for the day. First the Bronx zoo. We didn't get to see it all but we did have fun. Tiring but fun.  but the fireworks display was the best. Its a different thing than what we experience it back in India. You just sit back and enjoy the show, previous experience for me at least shows how it can be just as fun to be more active in the setting off of the fireworks than simply be passive and enjoy the display. I cant decide which I like better. One thing that remains the same is definitely the smell afterwards. That brings a lot of fond memories back. Waking up, dial day, taking the traditional "oil bath" and always being late for going down and setting off a token firework. That was then and this is now and I just have to settle for the way things are now. And I point out, they ant too bad at all.

       urlLink Blogger: Login   Over the weekend I went to two places. Both were worth writing about. One was Chinatown. Its interesting to see places like that where it's a settlement of one particular kind of people. In this instance for the most part, Chinese. But on the other hand, it has its two sides. I bought two dresses there. I couldn't resist. I know its probably cheesy and I know that stuff is just for the tourists but still I couldn't resist and they really did suit me. K was very happy with them and my look in them. I meant to have a small fashion show later but then at night, we both ended up just a little bit drunk on the kickass margarita that we had at bertucci's. All we could do was lapse into unconsciousness.  but Chinatown was really a cool place to explore. How do I explain a place like that. Like the Indians it seems they would capitalise on whatever they can, including their own culture to make a fast buck. And that's what is so interesting. I feel at home. You know where you are. I haggled over the price of the bag I bought and just for a moment I felt like I was back in India haggling at fashion street (which incidentally is not a place I have been to or bought anything from in ages). We had lunch there. The Chinese food was good but we ordered too much. But by the end of it all we managed to finish it all though. And with that heavy meal we kept walking. I would have wanted to examine and explore the place some more but the rest of them were not too much in the mood for that with the multitudes of people there. But I had fun. The next day, Sunday that was, K had to work. That sucked. So I went with sushi and P to watch the gay pride parade. That was another interesting thing. Me with a bunch of proudly not-straight guys standing on the sidelines and enjoying the show. P and sushi were amused by my saying that was a waste of beautiful manhood, but I was not amused by that. I was saddened. Its a lifestyle choice that the person makes to be different. But really why do they make these choices. It interests me what motivates a person to make certain choices.  That was a good day too. I had a blast anyway.
