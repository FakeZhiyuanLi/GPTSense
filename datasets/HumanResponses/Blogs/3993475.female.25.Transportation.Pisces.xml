      Well it's been a few days... My boyfriend's been home and I don't quite care to share this blogger with him yet...   Well today has been a pretty shitty day. The baby has been making me sick since 5:30 this morning. It's continuous. So this will be a short entry.  I feel so tired and I feel sick and I just wish this pregnancy would just hurry up and be over with. It still doesn't feel real. How messed up is that? I'm almost 6 months pregnant, I feel the baby moving all the time and it still doesn't feel real to me. I guess it won't until I go through the labor and actually hold my baby in my arms. Anyway, I just wanted to drop a line... I have to go lay down again... Until we meet again.

      Well, things are kind of blah today...&nbsp;But I do have a rant to go off on.   Drivers... I hate other people's driving. Like people who feel the need to get into the passing lane doing the speed limit and not passing anyone. Now it's different when there is an exit on the left side, obviously because people are going to need to get off... But the passing lane (also known as the "fast" lane)&nbsp;is for passing. Don't go into the fast lane when you aren't passing anyone if you are one of these people who go the spped limit. Now I am not saying the fast lane is for going 110 mph or anything... but a lot of drivers go a few miles over the speed limit (at least around here). So move out of the way...   Also I hate people who stay in the fast lane until the last second when they know for 4 miles ahead of time that the left two lanes are ending... I never let them over... They piss me off... Get over early and you'll prevent a huge back up. If everyone started getting over early, then traffic would keep moving. Know what I mean?  But I'm going to end this quickly today... I might write aomething else later if I think of it... or not... who knows?  Until we meet again.

      If your significant other threatened to leave you every time you had a fight, does that mean they actually want out of the relationship?

      Well, if I had been able to get here earlier, you would've definitely seen a side of me that most people don't see... But some of my anger has cooled so the post won't be nearly as interesting, I'm afraid...   Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into&nbsp;a fight today about smoking. Yes, I know smoking is bad, for me AND the baby... but unless you've had an addiction, you REALLY don't understand how hard it is to quit. And that is something my boyfriend doesn't understand... I mean, I AM trying... I did really good for the first month, I didn't smoke any at all. Then my cousin's mom died and I started bumming a few off people. I mean I only smoke about one or two a week... which I think is pretty good... I mean even my OB/GYN told me "Although we would like you to quit, we only ask that you cut down." One or two a week is NOT bad. However, my boyfriend is being COMPLETELY unreasonable about this. He asked me today and I told him the truth (which is better than lying, right?) He blew a lid... "If anything is wrong with this baby because of your smoking, we're through!" (Keep in mind we JUST moved in to a new apartment together the beginning of the month and this is the second time he's threatened to kick me out, because he feels he has leverage on me since the apartment is solely in his name and I couldn't get approved for an apartment if my life depended on it). Of course, I replied to him "What about the first month when I didn't realize I was pregnant and smoked the entire time?" He just repeated what he said. So I told him "Fine, if that's how you want it." (He doesn't realize I DO have a place to go, if I need too... but my best friends house is a little crowded as it is and I would prefer not too.) My whole thing is this: It is hard to quit an addiction... I try everyday... Sometimes I fail... I mean I'm pregnant, my hormones are going crazy... Sometimes I just want an effing cigarette, ya know. Of course, I've told him it would help if he supported me instead of criticized me... Said, "I know it's hard, honey... you'll fight it better next time" instead of "Goddammit, you had a cigarette?? I want you out of the house!" Geez, like THAT'S not going to make me want a cigarette even more, right?&nbsp; It's just, he doesn't understand... neither about the addiction NOR about being pregnant... He doesn't sympathize with me, just says I am&nbsp;"trying to milk it for all it's worth." Is it my fault I am tired almost 24/7&nbsp;? He's the one who never wanted to use a condom because he thought he was sterile... Well guess what, buddy?? You're not! I am soooo tired... all this ranting has worn me out... G'night... Until we meet again.

      This is obviously the first post of my blog. I don't lead a very interesting life but often feel like writing my thoughts down. And trust me, sometimes my thoughts are pretty out-of-the-ordinary. I am currently about 5 1/2 months pregnant. I'm having a boy and although the name I have chosen is not a usual name, Braden, it isn't something from outer space, as my father puts it. It is actually Old English, but that doesn't matter. When you have a common name, where even your best friend has the same name, you tend to go a little different for your kids... at least, that's my belief. I grew up with someone with the same first and last name as me... imagine how annoying it is to have to use your middle initial on everything you do for school... My mother's husband adopted me when I was 16 and now I have a cousin with the same first and last name as me... So I have started going by a shortened version of my middle name... which my family refuses to use.&nbsp; But they criticize the name I chose for my son... it kind of pisses me off... I mean who are they to say that the name I chose for my son is odd... or from "outer space"... They didn't have to go through their entire life using their middle initial on everything... When people sign things, like their checks or on their licenses, they often sign first name, middle initial, last name... I got sick of it and changed my signature to first initial, middle name, last name... That's how bad it has gotten with my name... *sigh* I suppose I should get over it... I am 25 now, not still 10... but it still irks me... Anyway.. enough ramble for that... I now feel my son kicking me and moving around a LOT... It pleases me, because I take it as a sign that he will be very active (something I am not)... although I do hope he takes an interest in books as well to make him more well rounded... I guess I am getting ahead of myself... I am really excited about having this baby, although I am also petrified... I am glad I have my mother to talk to, although I wish my grandma (who passed away Christmas morning 2001) were still around to see this... She and I were very close. Wow, I seemed to have "talked your ear off" here... So I will leave it at this for now... Until we meet again.
