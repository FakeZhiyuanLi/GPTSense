      So, I'm watching the Olympics last night.  I see Paul Hamm trying to get the Gold for Men's All Around.  He's the favorite to win.  Now, every time I see Men's gymnastics, I'm reminded of the Stereotypes that all the guys who do Gymnastics or Ballet are homosexuals.  So keep in mind that I've got this in my mind the entire time I'm watching this.  Now, I have to admit that these guys are fucking buff.  They are built as hell.  The things they do are amazing to me.  Of course, I have all the grace of a 1-legged wildebeast.  And I have the power of a weak, powerless thing.  And they are competitors.  They came to play a very intense game among the very best in the world.  Hamm and the guy from China are neck and neck for the lead.  Each round, they swap places between 1st and 2nd place.  And Hamm is also battling with a wounded shoulder.  Then comes The Vault.  Anyone who watched this and was rooting for Hamm would have been on the verge of tears.  Hamm was heading for a victory when he slipped and fell.  Here's a Tip:  If you are ever in the Olympics and you want a Gold Medal, falling is bad.  Hamm dropped from 1st place all the way to 12th.  And everyone knew he was out of the running for Gold.  He could only hope for Bronze, and that would take a miracle.  But Hamm didn't get a miracle.   He didn't get -a- miracle.  HE GOT TWO!  He gave the best performance of his life on the Parallel Bars and again on the High Bar.  He got twin scores of 9.837.  That propelled him back to the top.  He won the Gold Medal.  This not only was a celebration for Hamm, for overcoming an amazing disadvantage, but for all of the U.S.  There has never been a U.S. Gold Medal in this event.  It was an Olympic first.  Adding all this up, I completely banished any thoughts I had about the manliness of these Gymnists.  This dude was a man's man.  A bro's bro.  A dude's dude.  He persevered, overcame the odds, and proved himself a winner.   Then....   Then he was interviewed.  He has the voice of someone who has sucked on a tank of helium.  His voice had a pitch higher than the woman who was interviewing.  He had the pitch that only comes from having another man's Schwantz rammed up the rectum.  He was a fudge-packer once more.  There is no doubt in my mind.

      In july of '03, I had a car accident.  I was following Girlfriend in her car as we looked for a motel to crash in after midnight.  The guy in front of her braked suddenly.  She did the same to avoid hitting him.  I hit my brakes but they failed.  We were only going like 20 MPH, so it wasn't anything to worry about as far as injuries go.  Her Kia Sorento got an inch-long scratch in the bumper.  My entire front of my Ford Escort from bumper to first set of tires turned into an accordion.  Completely crumpled.  My air-bag went off.  Some sort of fluid was leaking.  I think they said later I had a cracked block something on the inside.  Needless to say, repairing the car was out of the question.  It was scrapped and I was given $3,000.  So, Girlfriend has this 'great' idea of buying an old clunker and fixing it up.  I was just going to go buy one that was already functional.  I'd probably have one within a few weeks.  We are currently going on 13 months of "NO Car for Me".  Originally, I was told that it would be ready by Halloween at the latest.  Then by Christmas.  Then I stopped getting a due date.  Now, for some reason, I am apparently the bad guy in this situation.  I am the evil person who is impatient and who needs to just back off because I ask whats going on with the car once a week.  I don't know how this happened.  When did this transformation occur?  What is it that Girlfriend sees different than I do?  I see myself as the guy who has been patient for 3 months, then 6 months, then 12 months, and is still continuing to be patient.  She sees me as a jerk.  I'm pissy about this.  I have a right to be impatient since about 6 months ago.  But I wasn't impatient then.  I am even paying for everything.  I have just this week started to be impatient.  I figure patience hasn't worked for the past 12 months.  If the situation was reversed, she would have lost patience after 3 weeks.  But I'm impatient.  Fuck that.  Next time I get accused of being impatient, I'm going to lose it.  I'm going to explode and tell her that she's damn right I'm not patient.  I was patient, but I'm not anymore.  I've redefined patience with this situation and I've raised the bar of patience to new heights.  If Patience was an olympic fucking sport, You would hear my national anthem playing right now as I graciously accepted the Gold Medal.  But no more.  I'm done with patience.  I need a car.  I want a new job, and I need a car to go to interviews.

      Amanda Parsons is a girl I know from high school.  She is probably technically in the 'Woman' category by now.  I haven't talked to her since I moved to Tennessee back in the late 90s.  Why did I suddenly think of her?  Because of the Presidential Elections.  She always said that she was going to be the first Female President of the United States.  She said the only thing that would stop her is if some other woman got voted in before she became of legal age.  I believed her.  If I ever find out that she is running, I'm going to vote for her.  I don't even know what party she is associated with.  But back in the 7th grade, I believed her.  I believed that she really would be President some day.  She was smart.  She had personality.  She had a a good heart.  That most of all is what I want in a president.  Smart and good-hearted.  Bush doesn't have either one.  If she still has those qualities, I would still vote for her.  In all actuallity, she probably doesn't want to be President anymore.  No doubt age and experience have left her jaded to the concept of Politics.  Changing the world is probably not on her agenda.  She may even have a kid or two by now that take up her entire life.  But if she ever ran, I would vote for her.  I've never voted before, and I don't plan to vote this year, but for her, I would.  Because I believe that she would be a good president.  Thats all.

      What would it be like to be a father?  What goes through your mind when you find out that you are responsible for creating, protecting, nurturing, and raising another human being?  I've always wanted to be a dad.  I like to think that I would be a good one.  I think I'd want a little girl.  She'd be a tom-boy of course, cuz I would have to teach her to throw a baseball.   Girlfriend has two boys from a previous relationship.  Most guys are scared away by a situation like this.  I'm scared but not scared away.  I'm afraid that they won't like me, and that will put a strain on our relationship.  I know I hated my step-dad.  And I know it didn't help things go easier.  I feel bad for my Step-dad sometimes now that I know what he went through.  But its hard to feel bad for someone you've hated all your life, and who feels the same way about you.  I worry that they won't like me.  Girlfriend says that if that happens, and they give me the thumbs down, I'm out the door.  I can't blame her for that.  It seems unfair at times that such a huge part of my life is completely out of my hands.  They won't ever be my sons.  I will never be their father.  My best hope is that we can be friends, and they can approve of my relationship with their mom.  But it will always be a friends relationshp and not a father-son relationship.  I daydream about it sometimes.  I dream of Girlfriend telling me that she's pregnant.  I wonder how it would happen.  How would she deliver the news?  Would she be happy about it?  Would she tell me directly, or do some strange thing like leaving me a pair of "#1 dad" boxers on the top of my drawer, and let me figure out what to make of it?  Fast forward 9 months.  The delivery room.  I can't even imagine what it would be like other than I would be there holding her hand as she cursed me a thousand times and tried to break my arm off for putting her in such pain.  And then, when it was over, a doctor would hand her a little ball of baby.   I know I'd hate the part where we get woken up in the middle of the night by baby-cries.  I wouldn't be able to stand that at all.  But during daylight hours, I'd be happy to change diapers, feed, burp, and all the other stuff.  Fastforward again to the first smile, first words, first steps, teething.  Then, the first day of school.  I would want my kid to be smart.  I'd read to her every night.  I'd want to make sure the kid enjoyed reading.  That is one of the greatest things my parents ever did for me... Giving me that love of reading.  That alone is all it takes to make sure your kid will be above average for smarts, I think.  School plays wouldn't be any fun for me.  I'd like seeing my kid, but I'd hate having those moments mashed together with seeing everyone else's kid.  Puberty would be rough.  I'd probably be the one having the talk with her, and I'm not sure why.  This is the only part where I'd wish I had a boy instead.  I wonder if she would be an athlete or a band geek?  I was never either one.  Thats where the fun part of parenthood stops.  Because right after Puberty, the real world starts to close in.  Its not about playing sing-along with elmo anymore.  Now its about saying no to drugs, and how to deal with the sex thing.  But I would hope that I'd done a good job up to that point, and then do what I can to make sure that the choices she makes are the best ones.  I'll have to remind myself that I can't make those choices for her.  There is one part of parenthood that I am afraid of, more than anything.  I'm afraid of failure in parenting.  What if I raise one of those people who belongs on a Jerry Springer show?  What if I fail as a Father?  I don't know how I'd be able to handle that.  I don't know how I would react if I found out my child was a drug-addict, or a tramp, or an assholish jerk, or a snob, or one of those kids that gets teased for being too fat, or too ugly, or just too strange.  If I had to pick out of all that list, I'd go for the too strange.  I honestly cannot tell if I am dissapointed or happy about missing out on being a parent.

      I went to the fair today.  It was awhile since I've been to a fair like that.  There were rides, shows, crafts, shops, music, and food.  Lots and Lots of unhealthy and overpriced food.  One of the most interesting things about this fair that really set it apart from all others for me was the addition of an "Indian Villiage" setting.  Because of the Reservation that is a stone's throw away, Native American culture is threaded through everything in the area.  They had beadwork, dreamcatchers, carvings, and all kinds of interesting trinkets.  I was fascinated.  I was thinking of getting a wolf carving for Girlfriend, but unfortunately, my monetary sources are quite low at this time.  I need to start saving up some serious cash here soon.  I ate freshly-made Taffy, which was so fresh, it was still warm, and it hadn't hardened enough to hold its shape.  It bent over in my hand.  I enjoyed it.  I also had some Ribbon-Fries.  Thats another thing I never saw before.  Ribbon-Fries are just glorified potato chips.  I wouldn't pay $6 for them if I were you.  I also saw a set of hot-tubs.  I now want one for whatever house I end up getting eventually.  Once again, Money prevents this from happening now.  Oh well.  I can dream.  All in all, I had a good time, and I spent less than $10 for the whole thing.

      Here's where this notepad starts to live up to its name.  Here are the statements which are assumed to be fact which I base this theory on:  God and Only God is Perfect.  Satan Wanted to Be God.  Satan is Evil.  Here is the Theory extrapolated.  To strive for Perfection is Evil.  I Strive for Perfection.  Therefore, I am Evil.  This is the theory I came up with last night.

      Ever been Ditched?  I have.  There have been a lot of shitty points in my life, but there are few that top when I've been Ditched.  Its worse than the time that my Mom and Dad told me about their Divorce.  Preceeded by months of arguing and plain-to-see signs that the relationship is falling apart and that they don't love eachother anymore.   Ditched is worse than finding out my Granny has cancer, and is gonna die.  That was brought on by her choice to smoke.  Ditched is worse than finding out that you won't ever have children of your own.  Your partner, who you love more than some idealistic fantasy of parenthood, is realistically not capable of bearing children.  Been Dumped by Girlfriend before and that wasn't worse than being Ditched.  She had every reason to get rid of me.  Why would all of these tragedies of life be better than being Ditched?  Because they all have reasons.  There is a cause and effect rationale that can be applied to these situations.  Being Ditched cannot be reasoned out of.  There is no cause to bring it on.  There is no explaining it away except that some person, or persons wants to torment you, and does not want you to be around.  You have to be targetted.  Someone has to specifically pick you and hate you enough that they want to bring you grief.  To Ditch someone, you must have a cruel heart, but be able to keep it well hidden.  You have to pick your target carefully.  See that guy with the glasses, who came to the party without a girl, and has done nothing but stand in the corner and stare at his shoelaces?  He's a perfect candidate to be ditched.  This will be fun...  Being Ditched (in its purest form), can only happen to those who are already miserable to begin with.  You can't take a person who is happy and enjoying life and Ditch them.  It doesn't work.  Being Ditched, in my eyes, is the ultimate way to kick someone when they are already down.   ...We can get a great laugh at his expense.  Here's what we're gonna do.  First, find a good looking chick (or if you are one, you can have the honors yourself) to go up to him and invite him over to your clique.  He won't refuse, trust me.  In fact, his face will light up at the chance to meet someone and make a friend...  When its all over, no only will they be down, but they will be curled up in a fetal position, with tears streaking down their face, and giving serious, serious contemplation to suicide.  Ditching someone breaks the will to live.  ...You play it up a little.  Chat with the guy.  Find out what he likes.  "Transformers?  No Way! I love those robot guys too!"  You see how he smiles at being accepted by the group...  It takes away the hope that just maybe, things will get better if you can just get past this rough patch.  ...And thats when you know you have him hooked.  So, the group (Ditching works best with a group who are in on it)  all decides that they are going to do something fun.  "Lets go out to the beach and have a bonfire." At that point in time, everyone gets up to go out.  Invite the target to come with.  He may need some coaxing.  Once everyone is outside at the cars, you say to the target, "Oh hey, can you run back inside and get a pack of hotdogs?  We'll wait for you right here." or some other reason to seperate the target from the group.  Make sure you indicate that you will wait for him...  Being Ditched lets you know that there is no hope for you, and that you will always be miserable, and that any attempt to create some joy in your life will only lead you to a deeper darkness of which you have not yet experienced.  ...And when the target is out of sight, everyone takes off without him.  Its the equivilent of kidnapping someone, taking them for a ride, and then tossing them out of the moving car into a ditch.  If the hot chick who first approached him can give him a last-minute wave, that makes the game all the more cruel.  Try to time it so that he can still hear you laughing when he comes back out the door, holding a pack of weiners in his hand.  When the realization hits him that you never wanted him in the group at all, and that you were only having fun at his expense, the process is complete.  All that is left is for the target to go wallow in his own misery.  Wasn't that fun?...  Being Ditched is the way for me to know that I am truly a nobody.  I am truly so worthless, that the only way people interact with me is to bring me to the breaking point, where I am ready to accept he emptiness and embrase it as the only thing I have to hold on to.

      Ronald Reagan was known as the Great Communicator.  He's dead now.  I was always told that I had great communication skills.  Now that skill is dead.  Coincidence?  Hell if I know.  All I know right now is that I can try to share a thought I have with a person, and there is a good chance that they will misunderstand me, and they will take offense at whatever they think I said, and I will try to explain myself and end up digging my hole even deeper.  And of course, the harder I try to get out, the deeper I get in.  My thoughts make sense in my head.  Why don't they make sense in my mouth?  I pride myself on my intelligence and I end up looking more stupid each and every day.

      I'm a jealous man when it comes to Girlfriend. Thats her name as far as this blog goes. (The privacy policy prevents further divulgence of information.) If I see another man hitting on Girlfriend, who is already aware that she is taken, I become upset. The feeling is like someone puts my ribs in a vice and squeezing. I don't know whether I want to throw up then go cry myself to sleep, or fly into a rage and beat the snot out of the intruder.  Girlfriend, for some reason which eludes me, does not like it when I speak to her about this. She remains oblivious to the fact that a man was even hitting on her. In her mind, he was just being 'friendly'. She does not realize that what he really wants is to reach one hand up her shirt and the other down her skirt. I know their true intentions. I've been around males enough to know this, not to mention I'm a card-carrying member of the man-club.  So anyways, Girlfriend gets mad because I get jealous. In my mind, she has no right to be mad at me, and I have every right to be angry at someone for hitting on her. What am I supposed to do? Just smile and say 'Hey Larry, how ya doin? Yea, I saw you hitting on Girlfriend 5 minutes ago. Sorry she turned you down. Naw, I don't mind that you put a move on her. Its not like we are a couple or anything. Oh wait, I forgot, we ARE a couple. Oh well, lets go shoot some pool." Is that the reaction she wants? Does she want me to encourage guys to go hit on her?  Now, let me clarify here that if its a stranger who doesn't know she's in a relationship with me, I don't get quite as upset. He doesn't know, so he's not at fault. In fact, I usually think that the guy has good taste in women, but poor research skills. But those bastards who already know drive me to the desire of beating their skull in with a baseball bat. And yet, I'm the bad guy. Go figure.  Then, I see in her livejournal an entry that says "Being hit on at work by a sexy guy is cool". I'm not going to make a big deal over it. I can't blame her for enjoying a little attention from the opposite sex. And its not like she flaunted it in my face. But still, I can't help but feel that tightening of the chest. It makes me wonder what exactly this 'sexy guy' did to make her realize that she was actually being hit on. .... No, I can't let my mind wander down that path. That way lies madness. And I'd have to kill him.  My Jealousy stems from fear and a view of self-inadequacy. I know I don't qualify as a 'sexy guy'. I don't even think I qualify as 'cute'(she says I do) and I can only semi claim that I'm 'intelligent'. I'm afraid that she will someday find someone better and she will leave me. That would suck for me. If she dumped me for someone who really was a better person for her, who made her happier than I do, who fulfilled more of her desires, I would eventually get over my grief, and be happy for her. But I know it would hurt to find out that I wasn't good enough. Rejection would suck. If she dumped me for someone who was clearly an inferior to me, I'd be eternally in grief. Fortunately, she's too smart to do that.  At this point though, she has been hit on by 85% of every male I have ever seen in contact with her. And yet, she's still with me. Its been 5 years since we first got together. She has broken up with me twice in that period of time to be with other guys. Both times, I was against it, and I said as much. I didn't believe that those two were better. Neither of them lasted more than a month before she broke it off and got back together with me. I feel more confident than I did at first that she will stay with me. But there are always going to be those moments where I feel uncomfortable. I can't speak up without angering her and I can't keep silent forever because it just doesn't feel right. Hell if I know what to do.   For now, I just suffer in silence, and keep my eyes on those bastards.

      So, let me explain why I called this blog "Mental Note".  Often-times, I'll be lying awake in bed, waiting to fall asleep, when my brain starts to purge itself of all sorts of odd thoughts. In that time of darkness, these thoughts make sense. I've come up with theories that would solve all of life's problems and bring about world peace. The problem is that its about that time that I fall asleep. Hell if I can remember the thing the next morning.  So this is my Mental Notepad, so to speak. Here, I can jot down whatever pile of garbage that my brain decides to spew out. And I don't honestly expect my Blog to solve all of your problems. In fact, I'm certain that if I get 99% of those Earth-shattering theories out into the light of day, I'll find that they are completely retarded. But then again, that 1% left just might be an answer that someone else has overlooked.  But of course, I'm also going to use this as a sounding board for just about anything I like. You'll probably hear about me, my personal life and thoughts, my girlfriend, my family, my job, and all that other mundane crap that every other blogger in the universe talks about. So enjoy.

      Hello.  My name is Mark.  I'll be your Blogger this evening.  I really have no real overall goal in mind here.  I just want a place that I can put my thoughts to word and let others share them.  Whatever becomes of it, I don't know.  Here's a brief biography for you.  It will make it easier for you to generalize me, until you get to know me better.  I'm Male.  That alone will give you enough insight into my life to distinguish me from over half of the rest of the world's population. I'm 23 years old as of the time of this writing.  My birthday is June 23rd. I am white.  Does that matter?  You decide for yourself. I am 5'10" tall. Oh, I live in Buffalo, NY in the United States, but I didn't grow up here.  I was born in Rockford, IL, but I'm not sure if I really grew up there either.  We'll talk more about that later. I have 1 Sister, and one Step-Sister. I have one father, and 1 mother, and 2 Step-Fathers... sort of.  Yea, I'll get to that later too. And I have a very important lady in my life. Oh, I'm a bit of a computer geek too, so roll all that together, and you've got a framework for me.  Thats a lot to digest, and a lot for me to type, so I'm going to leave it there for now.  Have a good night.
