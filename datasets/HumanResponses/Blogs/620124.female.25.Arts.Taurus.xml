       Hey everyone who ever reads these pieces of fragmented ...words lets call them. I'm tired, its 1:50AM and I have to work tomorrow..work to pay for shit that I don't need to pay for..the whole concept of money is once again pushing onto me and its killing the very breath of my existance. Oh man how I wish I was good at buying stuff and being one with my material shit but I CAN'T...just spin my Bill CD's and misc music and cry, thats all I can do. I dont weep..I cry...words like..."We Better Dig it up somehow..."
I'm so fucking self indulgent. Lets be honest here, where does it hurt? Here? No..its just exhaustation talking. I'm so tired and I'm pretty amused at my attempt to feel sorry for myself. I'm not sorry. Sorry. I think I am getting really obssessed with Bill Hicks..and since reading the biography "American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story" I feel like I know him, and thats scary, smoking cigarettes and looking over my shoulder feeling a presence that could be Bill HIcks, haha...Yeah thats so rich. What the hell??? Something is definetly missing from my life that I can connect so deeply with a dead man. What's missing? Direction...oh lord..that word again....I'm going to be an artist, a teacher, a wild child ..amidst dirty laundry. Some days I think I have to stop doing all those...nasty things that make me so damn lazy. I wrote down in my physical journal that its going to be 40 days and 40 nights of sobriety...but I still smoke. I can't help it...I have this deep desire to kill myself and since Im too chicken shit to do it with a gun I have to do it with a cigarette...whoa man too harsh? Nooo its the Saaaame thiiiing....puff puff...
Lauren a girl I know..and Brian a boy I know are having a fight and its ridiculous...they are doing it too nicely. Bring out the guns motherfuckers and entertain me! Someone has to die!

       It was 9AM the usual story started out in the middle of the night...stood in my green terry robe waiting for the Telstra guy to stop fiddling with the telephone socket, felt like it was the start of a porn flick. "All done" "Oh I think you missed out one socket guy..."
Really bizarre, I went back to napping and spent the whole day stressed out. Agitated, painted my nails a glittery pink, thought, Oh my god why am I fighting this urge to gauge my own eyes out? If I want to paint my nails, god-dammit, it’s because I wondered what it would look like. It looked too fake. Attention seeking to something as banal as keratin tipped digits? Why do all those women do it? 
Watched the extras on my "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory" DVD, you know that wonderful line..."A little nonsense now and then, is relished by the wisest men" It totally put me in a good mood. So you know, fuck work, it just wasn't worth going in today, I was just exhausted and happy. 
In the face of someone totally convinced that God's word is the bible and that I was wrong for believing that God was love...it was hard really to defend myself. I don't know you know, each day my cynicism towards love really burrows deep in my psyche, the desire to believe that there is someone out there who can receive my love and my spirit grows smaller each day, perhaps I need to focus that energy towards the real purpose of my life which is to grow and evolve, and of course to learn to love unselfishly. Me as a nun? No, someone better than that, since everything is a Ritual with that nun deal. And anyways, I don't know if that force that enables us to do all that called God. Too much confusion and destruction in this world to leave it completly. Spiritually these days I feel so dirty.  
But since I'm bordering on deep coma like depression I think thats my next step, to visit God again. Breathe in the smoke that unveils my vision and weep at my helplessness, because ladies and gents, not all the answers lay on your Mooks clothing, wallet size or sneakers. Even your boyfriend will leave you to sail if your boat was sinking in materialist hell. There has to be another answer, yes? Good. Sometimes there is a little humility to be learnt. I was thinking that God perhaps is a state of being...what do you think of that? Pretty clever...oooh my cackles..

       It's funny how life ends up somehow...around your neck like a well meant hug that is choking the very breath from you...
Everything is okay. Trully it is.
Realised that I honestly don't give a fuck about anything with a dick. Smashing Pumpkins, Kevin Spacey, Drew and a red rocket that is imprinted in my brain, why? I don't know! The Train, The green jacket, a face so innocent framed by self inflicted depression, smoking and telling me stuff that doesn't matter, yelling at me, berating me, patronizing me, ignoring me, laughing at me, everything everything, leave me alone!.

I haven't slept, read Naked Lunch (again), had coffee, brought two items that cost $120 dollars. That's 2 items. Amazing isn't it? Let's take it like a man, brought a diet coke because I felt guilty for all the sugar I consumed during the week, scammed some free popcorn and took my mother to see A Beautiful Mind. All in the good name of masochism. Worked in the same clothes I slept in, walked around in a haze of sugar-junkie-dom that was dirty and low but I felt strangely peaceful. Either way when I finally made it home I scrubbed my skin pink and said gurgling in the water...Why can't I be normal?

Well...if I knew what it was...I think I would reconsider that statement.
Creative people can't be normal. And thats a fact, you anal, analogical, logical brats you.

       What’s going on? There is betrayal amongst my friends! Was Sunday that fucked up? I really have to talk to Justine about it...perhaps she does think that...but I'm not...oh well. This is too fucking weird anyways, Miss Piggy fucked up everything as usual, it’s not going to be a pretty sight the next few weeks at work, I'll tell you that. I'm so mad right now I'm just spraying the hateful word around, when I should be storing it for later oomph. Such is my life, sitting in front of the War Memorial, smoking weed with the most two annoying people in the world, the inner hateful and the inner cruel and I WAS THERE! You know sometimes I wish I didn't adopt the friends of my friends. That’s a solid gold New Years Resolution. But it was real weed and although the conversation was fucking lacking, I made up for it by singing on the steps, I also sighted chickens across the road…damn chickens; most people would see Police officers. Oh wait I did see some of them…but by then I was too immersed in Bob Dylan to care. 

It's Monday, I'm allowed to be vague.

".......I can't wait to see the look on your face as I put my gun up to your temple, pull the trigger that sends you back to hell. You butchered my art and only to save a dollar, are you ready to die my friend, are you ready to confront the end. Like Helter Skelter and Son of Sam, by the days end you'll know who I am, I spill your blood on the Hollywood boulevard..." - Dog Fashion Disco. "Headless"

I believe I am too cold and too sad to raise a hand and say "Please...just please stop it...give me an out to my frustrations..."

Poor little purist me

       Well what a weekened, its not like I do this on purpose, go to the Ritual, listen to Tool, have a blackcurrant alcoholic..splurpee was it? and then roam the streets talking to old school goths about the merits of Sepultura and the demerits of the fucked up white trash that is Pantera, I don't even know why I did it, it was just a Saturday night thing, there was no drugs, very little alcohol, just a lot of cigarettes and conversation that went no-where. I'm telling you, I'm having less and less moments of interest, this is pretty bad. Actually around 6AM on the train there was a lot of Pepsi and it fucking perked me up enough to have hilarious rants with Brad and Jeff. I watched the Count of Monte Cristo and loved it, although the end was pretty weak, oh Hollywood why do I come back to you?? Its not enough you have my enslaved soul addicted to your pieces of shit, its enough you tempt me with comp tickets so even if it is bad (which..oh yes it always is) I am forced by logic to say : At least I didn't pay for it. This needs a huge sigh of dissapointment. Am I slipping? Tonight its 4 and 45 minutes of Box Office hell, and I am looking forward to our Hyde Park meeting with fucking Basil and Oregano, afterwards, but if Miss Piggy once agains proves to me the real decay of human fraility...I will just cry. (Translation: If the weed goods are in fact a spice or real fucking weeds, I will kill everyone who told me to give her a chance and then cry). Today I found out that in Germany some guy killed 16 people...well. It's just pointless isn't it?

       It's amazing the level of disgust I am feeling for so many things, I feel disgust that life cannot be played by my rules, I’m disgusted that I am easily humiliated,, it disgusts me how people are so judgemental and so cruel over stuff that you mean well. I am more so angry at the fact you can only have one personality to survive in this world, and you can never fucking change it, I'm telling you now:  I feel like a complete DICK for liking you people, deep down inside you have corrugated hearts and thin oiled veins, you have no desire to SEE IT THROUGH. You disgusting mindless boxes of Do's and Don'ts! Let you touch me! Go on! I’ll fucking scream you down..Arrrrgh you spiels of nothingness! Arrrrgh!
 
Having a tantrum because oppression was my BABY TONIGHT. It kills me to have people residue what you have to say.
Like its trivial...a strange touch, a spitball.

       It's so cold right now, I'm totally straight, not like last posts...Sorry about those. I'm feeling really contrite and peaceful right now, my bed looks real inviting, I know I will have a great sleep tonight, this morning. Internet Banking isn't working so you know, I don't know how much money I got. ::::Yawn. Stretch ::: I really could do with a cigarette right now. Its been an interesting night, learning HTML just because I think I might need it in the future, always acquiring new tools, have been using basic HTML in previous posts. It's kinda fun. 
Didn't go anywhere tonight, just got high and watched "American Psycho". You know the problem of that movie? Its not enough. No way near enough. But then again they have the time factor, its always about time and film. It should've been so much more artsy than Hollywood...but perhaps I missed the point entirely. 
I have to pay the Fine today....Whatever....not going to kill me. 
Nothing seems really real today. It feels so nice...Feel like Kate Bush in Wuthering Heights..and I don't care. Its amazing...not being a member of the outside world even for a day.

       I'm finding it hard to neither function nor focus on this entry without music, it’s just insane. Wait a minute...Well here we go: A band from Pennsylvania USA; Ween. This duo always manages to create music that soothes and entices the soul with nostalgia for old tunes, that tune you remember but can't place. This rare talent makes Ween, so fucking out there, so cool in my own favoritism. Listen to this track: "Falling Out", a plutonic song about realising the end of a friendship because of love. The beat is loud and resembles an excited heartbeat; Like my heart seized and crumpled as my cold hand would grab the phone handset at 4AM, talking and torturing for hours..and now.."falling out, look away, its the end". A tingling Cliché. The solo guitar is reminiscent of old 1980's metal, something that perhaps Jon Bon Jovi would try to play out, very Van Halen, yet the whole song is extremely country western in style. Oh shit, the song is over...now here is Tori Amos, piano in an old jazz room with the smell of talcum powder and whisky lingering. You know you have something when songs travel you to different places, where you can taste the Southern Comfort and hear the slap of an old man's hand on a prostitute’s thigh. Its every Maverick episode and Western novel I have ever absorbed. I'm just...oh the time, the time. I have to go, Go downstairs, well fall downstairs, play it straight to my mother while I laugh at that old T.V show that His Holder of my Girlish Notions told me was so juvenile to like...just because of a crush on a guy named Topher...

It's pretty funny when you think about it.

       I do not know Bill Hicks, I do not know him, I do not know Bill Hicks, never met him. Yet why do I always manage to sound like I do? Its strange, fucking frightening myself. I think my hatred towards Dennis Leary is just strong and unrational, I guess I keep going back to that passage in the book, where one of Hicks managers is just watching Leary ripping off Hicks material right in front of her and when she confronted him, he just looked at her and walked away...I mean that just cut me deep, if its true...Although I never liked Leary, too damn greasy and poppy for me; The mediocre's comedian. Do you hear what I'm saying? I'm actually upset right now, had a fight with the "Keeper of the Womb and Umbilical Cord" and it has totally drained me, why do we listen to that figure in our lives? Why does that one person have the power to totally reduce us to shivering masses of emotional wreckage? I can't totally think straight, I think it was watching 40 Days and 40 Nights that also did me in...Don’t watch that piece of shit...it can only make you horny and spiteful.

       I'm getting sick of my ranting, like a little violinist. Saw Resident Evil today and laughed so hard I thought I was going to pop a tube! Oh lord...take me now oh you evil Jezebel Milla! Hiiiiyaaaah! Take me where? Why where everyone is beautiful and strong, healthy. She looked good while she was getting fucked up, you can't go any further than that delusional state of cinematic art. In reality, my boys, we girls are beautiful in everything we do, as we sexily get ready for bed, yanking our bras off, yawning, scratching the ribs and fall asleep with mascara crusting our eyes, there is nothing better than waking up and realising you've vomited...this is such a sure turn on. Isn't it? 
I believe I will give you a quick closure to the God deal I was thinking about the past three days, God is our connected spiritual level...and right now...it’s at an all time low. Laughter is our meditation to get the bitch back into our souls where we most need it, I'm pretty sick of not seeing people smile out of genuine happiness, it fucking bothers me we are all so miserable. Like the plantation scheme isn't working out...Hark, the giggles I'm getting. Laughter is our resource into englightment..so lets see..  pamphlets that read "Religion will not save you" that on the other side say "Jesus is your true Saviour"....Hmmm...Christianity will not survive without corporations and vice versa. Think about that.
  Played mind  games with the customers, one tried tricking me into believing a 20 dollar bill was a 50...you'd think I didn't have the IQ available to realise any differently. I have to feed myself and my ambitions to get the hell of this planet sung, you think I'll risk an easy well payed job to a deranged "You fucking OWE me" fuck? You little pestilent consumer, I'm playing the monopoly game as it is without my fucking consent, I'm bitter and I'm pissed off that I have to be a subservient to your delusional grandeur. So when you try to get out of it by pretending I'm fucking colour blind or a robot that doesn't process human motives, like the stink that comes off you as you try to desperately cheat a company that has WON into making you WANT TO BE THERE...its no wonder I get my little jollies into playing along. Holding the godamn orange 20 dollar bill in the air,  "This is a 50?" 
"Yes" 
"Alright then... (handing him a 5)...Then this is a new note, a 30. Have a Nice Day"

I'm sitting here, bleary eyed, semi straight and tired tired tired. I don't know if I want to keep going...well actually I do and I do, the only times I will say those words I assure you. Dragged Justine over to my place on Saturday, I was typing the last log with her sleeping; I had written quite a lot about the bizarre circumstances that happened while she was here. You know the real crucial thing is that presently, I'm not truly happy, so how can I expect a visitor to feel well about a place that even I can't fucking stand? Then the escape fiasco…Ha; I’m feeling so honest right now.
Went to her house on Sunday, ate curry and watched Mallrats. Did I mention we got totally fucked up? I haven't been that catatonic for ages, totally felt it too, Lauren came over and we played Tarot cards, watched the Exorcist and The Three Amigos....oh it was just so cliché pizza eating drug-fucked fest. I didn't feel God, I felt temptation. I don't even give a fuck anymore, about anything about anyone apart from my friends and family. I've become everything I hate; the Apathy is going to kill my creativity if I don't watch it. To be truly revolutionary you have to love the human race, and I've come to the crucial part that lets me choose my future attitude towards the whole concept of life, should I be tolerant? Well yes, too many times I have become unnecessarily angry or upset, you know that. Appearances just aren’t worth it, people will say you're an easy target to be stepped on, but I don’t give a fuck what they think, I can be strong on that occasion. Goddamn it I'm going to do my head in, this just isn’t what I need, more neurotic moments. I know all this shit inside and out, I know that I can shake my fist and proclaim anarchy, if there is a love for this stupid pathetic rat of a race then I’m in it! To look at a street amidst a riot, to see the blood that sprouts the very essence of creation and rebirth, to see the hands that shake and rattle the very systematical core of Life…It’s so hard to keep your eyes open for so long, but an instant is all it takes for sheer exhaustion and questionings to take place. I’m not interested in being different, just a casual observer. Didn’t do anything alone this weekend; I need to be alone again for a week. Can I do it? Can I?

       It's hard, walking around with people being Star Wars freaks. I just don't know what to think about it, I saw the part where Yoda fought the bad guy, Darth Sidious, and it's pretty impressive. He has a little green light sabre that he takes out and fights with just using the Jedi Mind ...thing... I don't even know why he decides to fight him; I guess the fact the bad guy walloped the Holy Ass out of Anakin and Obi-Wan, and so forth. Aren't Jedi's solitary and with simple lives? Who hold the belief of no harm?  Mmm. I'm just thinking now, why people constantly prove to me that hype is everything and substance is nothing. I don't know, Star Wars is an old concept, its space military, Bad Versus Good, but what's so strange is that we no longer have "Good" and "Bad", in that sense. Nowadays it’s not necessary to have heroes, although I will tell you this, people who constantly try to revolutionise our world to be more connected and more equal are onto a good thing. It’s the message our Alien brothers are giving us sublimely, and if we don't take good care of our knowledge we will lose out. Ha. Perhaps sleeping on a bumpy mattress, drinking red vodka and smoking about 25 cigarettes a day is taking its toll but I think technology is a good thing, Saw Hard Word last night, as well as Mean Machine, one was average one was good. Shit I don't know, movies are freaking me out, I'm working too damn much in that place and it’s probably totally fucking me up. I am seriously infatuated with a 19 year old, granted he turns 20 this year, but that's just so odd, why is my emotional maturity so low? What happened! My whole mind frame is totally immersed in Star Wars, I'm so scared, I do not want the force to be with me! I’m not a big cheese fan!

An Empty Post
 

Read Cosmo with Grant in the back of Café last night, it was pretty revolting, how do women/people read that shit. My favourite line was "Her orgasming isn't my problem, if she does, that's great, but it’s not my responsibility, as long as I come, that's all I want". Charming. And the sad thing is that most women are so fucking stupid and empty that they will take this guy and prove to him and his kind that we don't mean shit in the sex equation; "I can change him!" and still sleep with him, hoping one day he’ll care. I will say one thing, if the man makes no effort to make me feel good, he is a LOUSY LAY. I'll repeat that   again   so it fucking computes A LOUSY LAY, and I don't fuck mediocre assholes. I am getting interested in the opposite sex again, too bad the current one is 3 years younger, but he is still pretty. Smart…Did I mention pretty?

       I feel like I have to apologise for that last mammoth post, well I'm sorry? I guess that didn't make it feel any better, I'm Sorry? Writing a mammoth email to a Perthanian, and well I just don't know what I'm going to do for the rest of the day. Working tonight, but you know that doesn’t count as Day. Last night I had a drink with Lauren at the Pavillion, seediest pub in Sydney and found out a few things about her I didn't know before...which is a good thing, although they unnerved me. A lot of people carry with them a whole set of   Neurotic Problems  , and sometimes they lean over and ask you to have a look at them, to see if you can help to solve them. It’s sad; because I understand the depth of struggle one can go through trying to exorcise their demons. Ah but you know, shit I don't think I'm anywhere near perfect, can't help those who have worse problems than me, because I don't have the answers, answers are so custom made, there is a truth sure...Just look towards it, to shed yourself of any pain or discomfort, it's totally non-relevant any of that neurotic shit. We all have our issues, deal with it and them. For example, I still worry about the state of my physicality, and the only reason why I worry about it, is because I've been trained to believe there is a physical representation for the personality, and frankly my state of being and my physical body just don't match, they are not reflections of each other. Ha just saying that totally solved it, Bullshit, they are total representations of each other, I fucking HATE myself and it shows! There is a great impatience with the way I do things, and a great embarrassment that I generally don't have the love for myself enough to take care of me and feed money into a booming Cosmetics company. I know its so totally not with the program that's in my head, but that's what I feel! In true hindsight, I just don’t care what I look like, but that represents the problem of: Your body is a tool to help you find the total meaning behind life, and perhaps I take it for granted. Too much fucking extremes, never gonna find a happy middle if I keep blubbering the same verbal diarreah. Talking to Lauren, telling her that she had the right to get rid of ANYONE who was making her feel like she was being smothered in Neurotic Hell, when I realised something…What if that person was you? What do you do then?

       Rock and Roooooll....my feet are cold and I'm too lazy to put on socks. In fact I believe that is the problem with the world today,  laziness , the fact that we would rather put up with a slight discomfort, such as having cold feet, or living in an oppressed economic system, than to get up and say, You know what motherfucker...I've had enough of your crap, let's see if we can do something HUMAN for a chance. Let's change the world! I wanna be comfortable and warm! I don't wanna move! Yak Yak Yak. Sorry I'll try to be a little more enlightening. Friday night in Box Office, right, everything was going good until well, they said I was $100 over, for those who have lives and reason, and thus never had a till job, this may sound a little strange, so I'll briefly explain. Commerce and economics in the service/goods area that deal with CASH....that word just had an effect on me...I'm not sure I like the effect...I feel almost nauseous. Anyways, the businesses that deal with CASH give the clerks, which are me and my kind, a float. A float is a figure of money, in my case $500, to be able to give change back to the lemming...I mean customer, during the economic day. This isn't my life, I'm a fucking struggling artist, I'm a struggling LAZY artist, so don't think I condone this. I'm just a pawn. A lazy pawn who wants to have zero responsibility for 2002; But a pawn nonetheless. 
So anyways, the change is registered in the computer as 500, then all the transactions I make are recorded, I deal with the money, so the computer just add the price of the tickets per ticket as I sell them, it then adds up them all up at the end, I add up the money and see if the figures match. At the end of this particularly brain numbing shift; the computer said I was 100 bucks over, meaning I had $100 more than I should. Are we all together on this? Do we understand?
Good. The significance is...
Well you know, it meant for me, sitting down and --- Rubbing my hands over my face in remembrance, God the pain I went through that night was almost hysterical--- Sitting down and enduring Jezebel's grating tirade said in that "I have to do this.." tone, like she doesn't enjoy it the dirty demon spawn. . . Listen Jezzy baby...  since when did I give a flying fuck?   I made you an extra hundred; I was stoned at the time you're lucky I didn't give out hundreds everyone would be queuing up in my line! God dammit! That's how I should've reacted! It's what I wanted to truly say. But the more she told me about the consequences, the faults, I actually got upset, I mean if I totally ripped people off, that's pretty bad, I don't know how it happened, perhaps I should cut down on the whole smoking thing, since I don't remember, I really felt guilty, sickened, for many reasons, the ripping people off and most importantly because I didn't remember any of it, I got pretty worried about the state of my mind. It was exhausting hearing they were going to suspend me etc, etc. I mean looking back, its just an extra hundred, they could just fuck around with the numbers and put the money I made into the records of the people who actually lost money, all these things were racing through my head as I signed the cash variance form and was ushered out of Box Treasury. Contritely, yeah I know, CONTRITELY I asked her that if it was an error with the computer or the safe wasn't calculated properly, or if I was given a 600 float...whatever, to let me know. She looked offended but then fuzzily said that she will thoroughly double check and put a note in my locker in case it *was* a misunderstanding so I could relax...if not I had to speak to Ian. Hello?
The location manager? This is what got to me, contrite fucking gone, EXCUSE ME? They thought I was stealing money! Like I would retaliate to that fucking arrogant piece of camel shit company by STEALING one hundred dollars, because everyone knows I barely tolerate the place. Just a means to an end, money is money, and unfortunately in this society you gotta make it somehow. Trust me there is a drawback to being lazy, you have to take the giant cock of your provider up the godamn rectum...oh this was too much! Like I'm not an imaginative being! First of all I'm not a terrorist, I don't believe in terrorism, it doesn't solve anything, and if I was going to do something revolutionary, I wouldn't steal  $100. I'll clean the whole place out, write a note that says "Don't be a whore" and staple it to Jezebel's face. Bomb the whole building...
Wait...
Alright, Alright, I'll just give the old dogmatic spiel...it won't change anything, but perhaps I could lead a strike...but unfortunately people are too lazy to educate themselves...my job is too dispensable...15 year olds are waiting in line for it. I hope the new generational batch of 15 yr olds won't. I am praying for a generation of revolutionaries and rebels. God please....?
 Anyways, who gives a shit, in the end I just wanted to go home, Phil and Justine were waiting for me, and so we smoked up in Hyde Park for an amazing 20 minutes before I freaked out and went home. Then the next day, Jezebel passed me and told me that it was a computer error …but I should’ve counted my float to make sure.
That I should’ve re-counted my float to make sure. (Counting once isn't enough?)
A float THEY give me
A float that THEY signed for
Signed to CONFIRM that the amount that was given to me was 500 dollars.

       Ahh it’s just not fair is it? The constant abuse, ahhh fuck I fucking love it, its such a rich time. I don't know what to tell you, were to start, the past three days have been an overload of the upmost hilarity. First of all, this story: A tinted small girl is sitting amidst a group of people, I casually saw her walk in, but you know, who computes small girls? So I'm standing, watching the boys play pool, when I hear a small crash, she had gotten up suddenly, drenching herself in the cheap white wine she must've just brought, it seeps through her gaudy skirt, looking like she urinated all over herself. Well you know, I knew from that moment that the reactions would be dramatic, sure enough the bunch of primitive beings she had surrounded herself with, and was a member of, begin to laugh and point like she is on the fucking Humiliation Channel, and in the most arid and sick way she begins to shriek and scream, in desperate retaliation: "I did not pee my pants!! I DID NOT PEE MY PANTS!”  The level of self consciousness in the bar rose to hellish proportions, Her fickle groupies continue to point, having fun mocking this piece of glitter shit, and amazingly she pulls down her skirt, and while standing in the middle of the bar, she sticks her hand inside her white g-string feeling her crotch, smelling her hands, squeaking " Smell me!! SMELL ME! I did not pee my pants". At this point, I could feel one of the boys stand behind me with a cue in his hand, he said something to me but I couldn't hear him, I just stood transfixed in absolute astonishment as she came up to me crying, shoving her crotch scented fingers into my face. “Smell me!” 
Oh how my love for the human species fell down another notch...How my temper nearly rose…to new heights…(Think...Feminism…Think...Women’s Lib, women like her push it true equality back another half century just for merely existing). 
But in the end I just started to laugh hysterically, at the ridiculousness of it all, even the bouncer came up to me and with a grin asked me if I wanted a drink of water. 
"No. Just my love of the HUMAN FUCKING RACE BACK" 
There is such a thing as dignity right? Am I too proud? Too proud to subject myself to the basic primitive reactions? I fucking think so, never would you catch me in such a dress, drinking that same drink and reacting like the opinion of half a dozen walking hyenas MATTERED...

       Well Well Well Well. Why are there so many fucking police in town tonight? 500 of the little buggers with their clubs and pistols searching and interrogating the folk of Sydney. All for the single ego boost of one Chief of Police.
I was clean, was there only to watch films. You know me and my sordid affair with the moving pictures, it's a true addiction one I hope to never break free from, we no longer have primitive campfires to snuggle around and tell stories in. So a crowded cinema theatre will have to do.
I'm actually happy I didn’t get many hours this fortnight, I can actually just cruise easy through, drawing, painting, spending sometime with an old friend called television. Reading, I brought books today. 
Don't have to deal with you, the unsatisfied consumer. You know what if you guys are so fucking unsatisfied, do something about it! BOYCOTT. It’s very easy you lazy prats.
Do you see me eating the filth that is MacDonald’s? NO way man, not even if there was a loaded weapon to my face: My last words would be: 
"You're going to kill me for not eating an imitation burger? Oh SEE YA"
I know it’s highly improbable...but have you ever seen the mad glint in Ronald McDonalds eyes? He's a clown ready to snap...

Men with children and the women who seem to find them attractive...

This study is fascinating as it is revolting. 

I don't know, overdosed on Subway, three guys from Britain tried to get Justine to go to GAS (a club) with them, they were treating her like a piece of meat, but she didn’t see that. One day she will, today she just thought they were hot British guys. I dropped her bag accidentally and her tampons came flying out and they played with them for 15 minutes.
Thank you God, for your constant sense of humour.

       Yes well, I think this is the stage between hysteria and exhaustion. Looking around, feeling myself up, yawning at Grant, Shrugging at Justin. You know work today was really fucked up, yelled at a bunch of loud mouthed little shits because they were   wasting my time   and funnily didn't get in trouble for it. I guess children really can't make a difference. Ate very little today borrowed 10 dollars from Lauren because I was flat broke, was fucking irritated and unstable the whole day. I actually miaowed into one of the two way radios at work. "Miaowwwwwwwwww".
Didn't see anyone that could make me want to leap into their arms and whimper "Take me home".
That's really wrong.
I see at least one a day.
Listened to Led Zeppelin, Weezer and Janis Joplin, you know that’s a fucking good day, yessir. 
I hate banks, I hate last week. Banks will make me pay big time for one single financial mistake, I'm going to have to be on the phones to them tomorrow and it’s just not going to make me happy. What? It's healthy to be angry at a multi million dollar company. And you know what, I know all those companies lie to their employees saying all this shit about how much money it costs and how its actually fair to charge the consumer that much, I know all that and its complete crap. Ever heard of Tax Evasion? 
I'm happy about my plans for tomorrow, you know, big plans. It's going to be a good day mark my word. 
Oh it’s just not going to be about the wasting of money, it’s going to mean much more. Will write later I guess; I don't even feel like writing to people anymore. I have to get personal and intense again, I think The Boy with the Torn Jacket Beanie totally fucked me up forever in that regards, and its okay to blame him because he couldn't have done it alone. I really helped him do it.
Still wonder about him from time to time, wonder in sheer amazement how I managed to totally screw it up.
Oh what's that? He was a total fucking basket case with issues that required hypnosis and psychotherapy?
Well, he helped of course. Couldn't screw it up without him silently egging me on.

       Want to watch a movie but its too cold to sit there down there by myself. Anyways I did this quiz because I was chatting to Brian, talking about his ex-friend who leeched herself to him and is now going through mass withdrawals because he gave her the flick...so you know...
fucking politics...went to Michelle's house tonight too, did I mention that?
Listening to Tori Amos, and staring into space.
I think what I wanted to say last post was, that hero worship was wrong and pathetic, because the expectations are just so blind. Its even worse when its towards a pop band because they don't really think about their responsibility towards good taste. Why make everything the same? Because it’s safe?
It’s enough to make one hurl.

You know, the body slows down with every wave of nausea and depression, and it’s just that I feed it, shit I know I do. But it won't be like this for long, what was that quote from Vanilla Sky? Lemme see "Every moment is a chance to turn it all around". It's true; this isn't the end of it, not by a long shot. 
Feel really good right now, just making some changes in the whole psyche thing, changing the oil that kinda change. Will get up at 9AM to wash the living hell out of those dirty cats, realised that there is a way to put pictures on this thing that doesn't involve me randomly picking answers on quizzes that don't mean shit. Oh that's right, I didn't think about my answers to the questions of those quizzes, in case you haven't noticed, Oh boy, what a psychological slut am I!
But really, I don't see how fixed questions could analyse my fucked up continuation; my eternally complicated and versatile existence cannot be solved though a quiz! The mother totin’ insult!
Did see one the other day that made me laugh  urlLink "What *NSYNC Hairstyle are You?"  . What's with the self obsession? Why do people need to constantly talk to other people about themselves? Through a band, oh boy, that’s just juvinile. Its really pathetic. Yes. IT IS.
P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C.
Why? Because you can enjoy music, enjoy it till you die for it, but just have the dignity to separate yourself from them as people. Because they are not gods, they are just folk who know how to play an instrument and sing. And as for people who worship pop groups, I fucking hate them, salivating, starry eyed freaks. Because they worship them as somewhat elevated beings. I don’t give a fuck who they are, if they suck through their repetitive synthesised bullshit I will hate them without even knowing them.

The freakish thing is, I would’ve fucked Robert Plant.
But I wouldn’t have respected him in the morning.

Well you know all this is really tiring me, I am so tired, running around the city, smoking and talking about well about anything really. Shouldn't this mean freedom? Sure yeah I really believe so. It’s just that its freedom not appreciated, when you run from your problems at home, its bound to happen. Went yesterday morning to see the Michael Leunig exhibition in the Sydney Museum, it was extremely poignant and I liked it. One of the short films was this...a voice narrating "How Democracy Really Works", a little man carries all the ballots and votes cast on Voting day on a truck, and takes the across town, it then gets put into this great furnace when they are all burnt and converted into electricity; which gets sent up to a special electrical line that generates light for a single light bulb that hangs on the 5th level men's toilets in Parliament House. And if you ever walk by Parliament House, you can see the dim light from that toilet sometimes, so you can be reassured your vote really counts.
It’s fantastic, really into it; made me decide that there has to be more to life than to live it like you're choking on the bone, to quote Robin Williams. Time for reflection boys and girls, I just don't want to feel tired anymore; I believe that's pretty sensible. It's just because I honestly do too much, it's wearing me down and its not because I can't handle it, I really can, man I was so fucking high in Enmore Monday night that when I was told I was to sleep in the attic, climb the most unstable set of stairs I had ever seems, I did it and survived without breaking down in a foetal mess! That attic room was so Convict style, I felt like the Blairwitch was going to jump out and kill me. Had vegetarian, felt so fucking happy I figured out how to climb down from the stairs once I was up, had a clear lab type smoking apparatus that totally made me laugh. Its fun but you know feel guilty for all the hedonisms, my cats were here alone....how pathetic.
Anyways I have to go to work, will write later, if the pages are working, they aren't working now. All this could be a waste of time.

       It's okay. It’s over, the little Girlie moment. Okay, so this is what everything has come to, my life as an unravelling bookend. So, Sir... What equates the perfect life? A Good, Healthy body? A healthy mind? A perfect management of your funds and appointments? Is that perfect? I just want to know because I can't seem to fucking attain it and something in my soul rebels at the idea of attaining anything without dying first. So you know, what now? Why can't I be happy? Why is there a sudden stream of tears appearing as I see more numbers and figures that once again prove that the governing bodies of this world are lying motherfucking suckling leeching pigs that don't believe in humanity unless its licking clean its fucking YOUNG. Oh it sucks you know, the constant bombarding of subtle messages through the media, the capitalist whore shouting from every billboard, YOU ARE NOT THERE YET, YOU ARE ONE MORE PRODUCT AWAY FROM YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS. Make IT happy, make IT privileged, and why the fuck should you care about anything else? WHY?? You have your godamn credit card, your movies, your Hollywood denial wet fucking dream, your so called "artistic release". You have your books and games, and you try to hold onto the idea that you haven't fallen for it, but you know what? This system is designed to rise to a level that we can't see, like building a tower of Babylon to the sky to reach God, you can't see it, the denial is in your very blood, your ancestors are all killers and I'm...just tired of pretending I can't join it. I am part of this sordid mess, what a godamn Chad...I don't know why I'm so torn...perhaps Expectations are so pushy and I'm lazy and I go with the flow, I have my own view on what’s cool and what's old, and what’s progressive and what’s anal retentive, and sometimes its just so different to the rest of the world and well where can I go? Here? Just help me end this on a note that can call me “The Tormented Artist” because I feel so fucking out of place… it’s just painful.

I worked 11 hours today, depressed and curt, got into trouble with management because I yelled at a customer. Apparently I was rude; apparently these people haven't clicked that I fucking hate people yet. Ate a chicken burger and got depressed again, the fact I'm lazy once again depressed me. Its funny, Justine and I laugh about it all the time, this laziness, I don't get it. Why this aversion to moving? I'll work on it.

       I always start every post, well almost always, with the word 'well', like I've come to check up on you and have to make an excuse to call, Well Well Well, hi and how are you, the day really has started and ended already and I'm pretty over it, like a shattered window pane, describe the pain, oh just please shut up...shut up. All the whining won't solve shit, so you know, the simple things are what I strive for. everything else is PMS.
I think I totally love Cat Stevens. 
Looked around and was very peaceful in what has come over me, reading Neal Cassidy's letters and feeling mild feminine outrage. I don't know, the women just seemed to fall at him like he was some kind of sun god but he was more like a goatboy than anything. I don't personally think arrests and seductions, promises, heartfelt nothingness, it would not have won me over, but you know, I wasn't born in the 1950's and Neal and Me would've fought and he would've died by my hand if lets say in the hypothetical sense, if he and I met. 
I decided today that my brain is lazy.
It's lazy and its trying to find a way to move but there is so many things in the way, like the fact I have such inbred insecurity, Its a forced limped step laced with arsenic, that insecurity, it forces my brain to walk like that, everyday, to even move a foot, imagine that. I sit and I think about what I should think about and it always comes trailing back at the sky. What I mean to say is that I don't want to sit and think, I want to feel. But right now I don't feel anything really spectacular. Sorry but that's the truth, I'm falling into old traps again, lalala. Fuck it. Such deep frustrations, my foot turns blue with wanting to kick myself.
This is it man, this intellect, this it  dude  the very state of the masses, the very fact that everything is easy and everything is customizable, and everything can be brought and sold. This is the land of value and sellable ideas, this is the Relationship Quick-Fix-It. Oh so one fucking wretched soul is kinda well you know, coughing up and saying in a teeny tiny upbeat volume...why do you let me lie down and take it? Why is it that you show me the world and tell me History has died. Why are Bush, Major and Howard running so many people's lives? Why is arrogance tolerated? Why am I repeating this to you, the ever effervescent consumer? Do you look up at the sky and see God smile down at you? If you are you're fucking deluded, why look up at all? Why not look inside the can that you fucking live in? 
This is it you know, the very bitterness that eludes the aesthetic prose of my work. I hate it too man, I do. You're not alone.
But its okay, the very end is near the immaturity is shedding with a single smile at a time, its such glazed times as I admire a beautiful man's face and wonder what colour his soul leaves when it shifts and sighs in sleep, I wonder why it touched me when Danny told me so quietly that he cried because a grey bird died in his hand. I have heard it so many times from so many sources but then when someone you know tells you so plainly you well, you feel good.
He nods when I speak and I shake my head when he does.
Its pretty ... well...funny.

       shit this is so illegal, hehe how fucking hilarious hacking into an university account that isn't mine because I don't even go to this Uni, there is security guards everywhere, oh the fucking hilarity. I won't be on long, pretty fucking drunk here, just meeting and teaching and earning money for drinking and talking about Picasso and Degas, its just insane. Will I go into the movies tonight? Whats even on tonight? You know I'm just getting a touch paranoid...
Well anyways, I have nothing much to do but sit here and waste away its pretty sweet. I'm staring at everyperson that comes in here, wondering if its their account I'm abusing, well you know, its just something to do, oh I'm just waiting on Danny, we drank and listened to god awful music and somehow outlived it all by singing "Blackbird"  and talking about language, you know language is the single most important...well apart from freedom...apart from self conciousness..
I'm not even making much sense. Had a revelation today that things happen by getting up.
Oopsie fuck...my stockings they have a rip in them....fell over then, sliding. Anyways I better go, I am supposed to be helping Danny but you know I don't know, its just evil, all of it, I don't know if I'm helping or just guiding, or leading or doing.
I was drawing in the bar and all the rest, now I'm feeling all cold because some important guy came in and he knows me so I better go.

Moping around work, looking at all these people asks for food you know will kill them, eating jellybeans and counting money and scooping ice cream and coming up with boy nicknames while at the same time crawling into yourself looking up at the sky as your car glides the Princess Highway on your way to Wollongong because you left your set inside the house and the only person with an extra set is well...in Wollongong.
Where is this Wollongong? Somewhere along Nowhere. NOWHERE. Why is my sister living so godamn...on the other side of the...godamn country...practically..
It’s just not fair and I'm depressed today ok? All the chemicals have hit rock bottom, reading the news in slow motion, listening to the Beatles again, talking to Brian, just feeling like I'm a ghost, feeling the fear again. Fear is interesting, I like feeling it, but its not really there.
I know this.
Just as I know my exhaustion right now.
It's so hard, it is and I'm breaking down this week. I'm bleeding in all the wrong places and I'm extremely hurt.

I have to transcribe this onto the computer when I get home, but you know, don't want to wait. Sunday, fucking red t-shirts were given to us, the ever elite box office staff, to serve in the name of Spiderman. Oh boy. The Unkempt Boy asked me to go see a movie with him after work, thanks Been. Anyways I said I'd think about it, and he asked for one ticket only. Did this hurt? Well yeah, but you know, uncomfortable feelings are my fucking fortress, my being baby, so I grabbed Nikki and went after him, to fall asleep while looking at the back of his head.

This is the end...Beautiful friend...Of our elaborate plans, The End....I'll never look into your eyes...again
Jackie is making rain signs, its very funny.
Oh I don't care okay? I don't care if the whole godamn world knows I dig him because its just one moment, one step in my life. Many steps with different names, places engraved, fuck it! Don't judge me! Wait a minute Universe, don't you have someplace else to be?

Etc..etc, but you know if it seems a little free, its because it was. A child wouldn't have felt any happier than I did Sunday night.  We took a photo of us sitting down while singing "All you Need is Love", around 2:45am; our backs to the ancient brick wall; When Grant gets that photo developed I want a copy, perhaps scan it onto here. I don't know.  
Hm. The rest is pretty wet, its all rainy here and all of Monday was Beatles filled and Cube filled and cigarette filled, even Jezebel rang to remind me what a cold fucking bitch she really is. Oh lovely.
Ah yeah, pretty free, incense, no drugs, just my body on the bed with a western novel jammed in my back as I talked to Jackie about freedom and the absolute need for it.
Then today came and it was just so fucking miserable, it was horrible, I want to read this in years to come and remember it as the day I nearly broke my legs trying to get over the fence, and I was bleeding and frustrated and smiling over that Joke Vaughn made…

 I don't know where to begin again...groan...groan... this dreadful insane cat erased tonight’s post, oh if it weren't so curious and cute, as it laid its paw on the escape button...what can I do? Oliver, never before has a cat tried my patience? How does it know how to do that? Anyways it seems like weeks since my last post, I was feeling the need to write again, especially since I have just had one of the most enlightening times, you know, it was at a small back bar, used to belong to Garry Wilson's grandmother back in 1925, now it's a place called   The Iguana Bar  ...in Potts Point, I believe. They were having a Beatles encore night.
The night started promising, the singer, an ample beauty named Goldilocks, began to sing, albeit not too well but then again...she wasn't John and she refused to say "she" so she sang "he", which really put me down for awhile, you know always taking it as a personal insult. I grew up with these guys, their simplicity is buried underneath cartilage in my very bones, I try not to take it too seriously at least ...I just can't see how she could sing: "He asked to stay and sit anywhere, so I looked around and noticed there wasn't a chair", it's a girl, dammit. Sorry the dehydration has finally gotten to me, but the self abused streak just sits there and says, will it to die? Let it happen. I don't care. It's still a girl.
There was an amazing band who played my funeral song "I'm Only Sleeping", they were called Snare, and were pretty energetic and just fucking talented, they also sang the song I often sing while sweeping the girl's toilets at work: "OOooh Darling, please believe me, I'll never do you harm". 
I let myself feel foolish for about...45 minutes last Thursday night.
I feel foolish now.
There was moments when I was holding my weeping sister while Joseph was singing "Here Comes the Sun" where I wondered if anyone but the truly desperate and alone can understand that song. Does anyone here truly understand the simplicity of those songs? I mean the true meaning the true Muse was saying beneath the words? While my head was resting on the cold train window and I was feeling so sick from just constantly forgetting my body does on some level love me, and my sister slept I was listening to Strawberry Fields Forever and I started to cry. But it was happy because I was scanning the sky and the words you know, fuck it all you know fuck it all the Nazis, the incompetent, the lazy, the meek, and the rude. Forget you. Let me just for one moment love your disgusting legacy.
The set was really good, some songs were just so cringe-ful that I'm sure Sir Paul McCartney held his temples as he woke up you know, ow something is hurting. We were hurting too, “Let it Be” was massacred and left to be pecked on by an unaffected crowd, hiss? Oh you know, more like, murmurs of get outta town, get outta stage, get a godamn life ya dirty haired wannabe. Was it to cruel? You be the judge! Because I actually believed it was alcohol who was doing most of the judging. Are you going to boo alcohol? I think not, you sordid social drinker and approved citizen. 
Been called JJ and asked him to come (again after his first refusal), raking up my phone bill, when I had already planted any wishes for anything deep in the ground in that field. I'm too stiff, too anti-social, too scared and too involved with art to let someone in, they wouldn't understand, and I don't care, I'll tell that to myself to everytime I am listening to a sexy song and a boy grabs his girl and kisses her. I have my cigarettes and my coffee and my desire to let it be. Sounds good huh? Pass the drinks, I think reality is trying to choke a squeak of stereotype from me. 
Mhmm, onto other things: I'm listening to this song by a Cuban singer named Silvio Rodriguez; it's so beautiful.   Como gasto papeles, recordandote...como nadie me mira con tigo, como pasa el tiempo, que de pronto son años...te doy una canción..y hago un descurso por mí derecho ha hablar..." 
I just had to delete a whole section, don’t ask me why, it’s just too hard to explain at this point, too hard, and I’m just you know, okay. Okay I’ll translate it as much as I can:
 “How I waste paper, remembering you, How no-one sees us together, how time passes, so soon it becomes years, I give you a song, and I debate my right to speak…” 
I did have a crazy thought, what if I was Anglo Saxon? Would I have my fighting spirit? What if? What if? My whole pitiful existence rests on two words that really are so fucking extremist…Been hooked up and I thought, why not me? 
Because I don’t want to because I don’t need to, because I have to, because I’d like to.
I should’ve been born in the 1960’s…everything would’ve been so much easier, and while I was there I would wish to have lived in the 1930’s, because nothing will ever be easy for me, no matter what time. It's like hard for everyone, this is the living hell, Jesus! Man, why do I indulge that horrible neurosis? Been and I joked about Jezebel moving and speaking like Darth Vader, perhaps, oh you know, time to bite the bit and stop bitching and read and just you know, dream that just perhaps maybe I will fall in love at least one more time…and I mean a two way road, not the hopeless crush/burn/crash, I'm not in Year 5 for fucksake, (Thanks Chris)

       I'm looking for a way to upload my own graphics on here, bear with me. I guess I'm a little tired and bored. Tomorrow is Harry Potter night.

       The world is an amazing place you know, was reading all these  urlLink  political blogs   earlier and got scared that these people of the US range from the crazy fanatical to the deeply cynical and yet all of them know more about politics that George W Bush. Hey you know, when you talk politics day in and day out, and reading the paper is like some sort of sick obsession you just wonder about what other political movement do we have left?

I just can't sit through CNN, I can't sit through TIME, I can see the god awful bias, the painted UNSAID WORDS and the fact that nothing is ever that blatant nor right/wrong.
Time apparently is running out...you paranoid fucks! I can't believe you really believe that...after a hundred years of total fuckups, you think that your judgement day is coming any time soon? If there is going to be a judgement call its going to be destruction of ourselves by you know more human mistakes, like not admitting it. I was sitting with Kimberly on the steps of the Pavillion when she said that its harder to say sorry than to cause a fight about it. There you go, that's the godamn problem.
I read everything and yet I can't stomach American media, its too red, blue and white.

People just try to be too P.C and elitists and say; yeah you know do it for the greater good no matter how tough you are, it will be better in the long run. Are they too blind to see that controlling people and putting words in their mouths show a loss of faith in the human race? Let them stumble and revolt into a million mental diseases, let crime run wild in the land of the fee. Who gives a fuck about people? I care about ME, about what I want, I want to survive. But you are just people who answer to other people, its a chain of oppression and its so damn old. Why aren't you talking about the people who actually have to live under this system, like you! Politicians don't know what its like to live like this, they throw us a bone, cut some slack once in awhile and are godamn happy to know we are nicely sedated and confused about the whole godamn thing, they are above the law, they make and reinforce the laws, they get away with so much and people just catch and let go, like they are oiled eels. Why isn't the Republican party demolished? That fucking elephant has EXPIRED, let capitalism the way we know it know kiss the ground man...it's started to cramp spiritual freedom, as in..it's killing it one breath at a time, and the deep cynicism is poisoning the minds of too many true intellectuals. I'm sick of people putting each other down, like they have all the fucking answers. Its so delusional. Too many people have died and there are too many robots in this world, there is some sort of thread of enlightenment, somewhere right? Some people say to take a side is to be a realist. I don't care how articulate you sound, you are speaking to me like you know, I actually should support the ever expanding US Empire. That's what they mean, Take a side. The Right Side. Our Side.

 From Saudia Arabia; Shaykh Abd-al-Rahman al-Sudays, preacher and imam of the holy mosque in Mecca: 
"We mustn't forget," the imam says, "that we are a nation of a pure faith and creed and a sublime world message and reminding people of it is the topic of this and every hour until the Day of Judgment." 

 From America: George W Bush; State of the Union Address 
There can be no neutrality between justice and cruelty, between the innocent and the guilty. We are in a conflict between good and evil, and America will call evil by its name. (Applause.) By confronting evil and lawless regimes, we do not create a problem, we reveal a problem. And we will lead the world in opposing it. (Applause.)

I rest my godamn case on top of the table where this political record is playing over...over...over...and over again.

       Is it because I was happy? Anyways, I want to be that girl The Beatles keep singing about, to someone, anyone. It's not even a companion thing, ok yeah okay maybe it is.
 I have a feeling they will meet great girls and have great lives and I will be sitting in some centre eating toast and weak coffee. I really was just ill from too much city, too much, too much.
I need to unwind, to shake out, and to loosen up; to regurgitate something that is lying at the bottom of my chest. Shit you know, I don't know why heavy industrial music should be on the same mix tape as classical or Tori, it just seems to fit okay? Working tomorrow and I think I ache so much that I would die from the pain...but you know Courtney Love is still alive and she doesn't care. You see it’s not really about pain, it’s about distraction.
I made up my mind will go to the Archibald Prize hopefully with an interested artistic eyed friend, would take JJ but you know, don't know if he is a friend. Sally told me today that I better be more than just talk...Yep. Okay.
It looks like I will drag myself along if Justine doesn't want to.
Or can't.

I found out something to write about, well to respond to, since Warren doesn’t email me anymore, I think I’ll reply on here:

MEN’S RULES – THE DEE RESPONSE

1.	Learn to work the toilet seat.  You're a big girl.  If it's up, put it down.  We need it up, you need it down.  You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.

Learn to aim, don’t be so lazy as to think that if you have a wider berth you will not leak all over the place and thus not be an embarrassment to us. You’re a big boy, why don’t you be considerate and put it down or learn to handle your organ? It’s just laziness pure and simple, you know, I think that’s what women really bitch about in the first place. Personally I don’t give a fuck, but if I see one spot of urine you are going to be so lucky to have any hide left after I’m through reading the Public Health Safety Act of 1965 to you word for fucking word; Disgusting…simply vile.

2.	Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!

Since you mustn’t bother with telling your loved one, you actually love her, or being considerate of her, or actually doing things for her like she does for you with her tolerances of your disgusting hygiene problems, and laziness, or how she actually without doubt believes in you and shares her body with you. The very fact you refuse to even remember token sentimental dates such as birthdays and valentines which as superficial and commercial they may be, they are her only physical hope that you can show her even a cliché form of love. Oh my god, the poor desperate woman…when you forget or make a half hearted attempt it’s just another void, another ache in her that wonders if you truly want her or just want her food, her house or her body. You see women are extremely sensitive; and insecure. You only have yourself to blame for creating something like magazines and TV Shows that are just pretty unrealistic. Be skinny and gorgeous like Claudia, eat snicker bars! Dress Gucci, eat McDonalds, not every woman is perceptive enough to be unconfused. Anyways, all they need is the love you can offer, because that’s what she truly wants to believe in. If you don’t love her, tell her its just sex. Save yourself the $10.95 for the wilted half a dozen roses you brought from the petrol station. 

3.	Sometimes we are not thinking about you.  Live with it.

Sometimes women wonder if you’re thinking at all. That’s why they ask, they want to know if you’re thinking about any problems they can help with, or an opinion they can argue or talk through, they actually communicate you know, it really helps. If the girl asks if you’re thinking about her, there’s the bright red neurotic alert and you then have the right to tell her just that: Actually, no, live with it or move on.

I was going to write the rest of it, then I just started laughing and thought... I could be fucking drawing for godsake!

       This is pretty jive like, you know sitting up in Level 4 which is nothing but a whole mass of doors, with Justin reading comics and talking about sperm like logos, I know it sounds weird but hell it was funny. Oh yeah I also listened to Nirvana had a real good time reading the Bill Hicks newsgroups made a date with Sally and now am laughing hysterically over the fact that Hermione apparently needs some Pantene, oh she's just gorgeous! Pretty excited here you know, the jive, the high, the fact that Vicki likes to read to me the ever dubious, the ever banal the ever ridiculously BADLY written American Literature by a no-name fucking clichéd flavoured fiend colleague oh har har har. It's not that I think myself a good writer, I just don't talk about people like they don't have faults or bad feelings or sordid pasts. People are people, etc, etc. Make them interesting man, make them real, make them stutter and spit with their ever present silences and chatter. Har Har Har.
Okay lets be a little more concrete so perhaps I can slow down.
Brian is over, fixing the temperamental Laptop:
"Tell me they go shopping and they don't bother to get Harry some casuals?"
"Why does Hermione wear a skirt?  (laughter)   She knows what she's going to be doing, foolish girl, why not pants?"
"Perhaps it’s a lesbian thing? She can't wear them because she's a determined lipstick dyke? There has to be a token gay character in every work of fiction. You know that"
It's not because I've fallen and tapped into a mainstream vein of literature it’s the simple fact that I like Harry Potter. 
I also like Calvin and Hobbes.
I loathe Winnie the Pooh and think Garfield is my alter ego.
Pop culture isn't really wrong, its a childish thing, the warmth we feel over the media that is meant to express a sentimentality that is concreted over basic human feelings, such as the wonder of the magical, the optimistic adventures and the fact that we can have everything in one single day.
Brian being over, told me that I was mentioned in Lauren's  urlLink  journal . So in curiosity I read what was written about me, and as it turns out it was something about her. Who would've thunk it?
Sorry I was thinking of Bill just then...
A commercial gone wrong, like that old AIDS ad...

       Sorry I had to delete that post, it didn't make much sense and it's not the true feelings I harbour. You see sometimes you lie to yourself to see if the situation can get any better, the whole pretend to fail so if successions come you are actually surprised, sometimes you can feel. I taught my first painting class today, it's actually not half bad to teach, it's just interesting to see what people create, I had to speak in Spanish and well you know me and Spanish I don't know exactly how to truly express myself so its was purely visual, they had a great time and I did too, although these women are schizophrenic, depressive, etc etc. I just felt it man, I felt it and it totally brought me down when the ways of human spirit comes to me in such a broken form, but they tried and some of the drawings and paintings were so rudimentary, but so innocent and yet filled with such wisdom and pain. I don't know how I can take another class, they all pitched in and payed me $14 for the two hours and fed me lunch, I mean these are decent kind people with such severe problems that they have to take medication to overcome. Surely I can put up with the force you know, can't be such an emotional sponge for ever. Plus they had a good time and I did too when the actual paintings were being done. For sure.
Mind is broken with so many things to say, one about JJ, well where can I start? When can I start? I don't think I have anything but you know the facts before me and they don't look good. Because you know, it's the prime case of the bull in a china shop, why can't I tread this lightly? Why can't I just shut up about it for just one godamn second, I think I just need to keep going and don't look back, if its meant to happen in any shape form or whatever, it will. There was this thing you know, about how retarded I get, about the whole thing, Hey Hey Hey a bit of laughter and a little bit of Moff, I know my addiction to life and love is really bloody banal but I can't help myself, like a child sucking its thumb...whatever. I think I need the Beatles.
I'm sorry for everything, everything, I'm really sorry

        I'm exhausted, I know I should go downstairs and rescue my alarm and set it because I run the danger of oversleeping tomorrow and I have things to do, things to plan and watch act out. I've been bad and acted out my fantasies and have put myself on the line again, been out and stayed out and been confused and have died over you know, haven't picked up a newspaper in a week and have grimly chain smoked and watched Spiderman instead. Oh Spiderman why did you have to be the shining light? Why couldn't you just be an impressive movie that made me shut my mouth? But you know, I didn't and now all I have is the memory of the Boy Who Hasn't Quit Smoking and me sharing a fag down in the fire exits and laughing over a sexual innuendo that didn't happen. Anything else that happened that day didn't happen, okay okay, I would have liked it to have happened the way I wanted them to. But you know how can you pry open a man who doesn't take the great friendship I am offering? Oh well. It's just hell complicated and I'm so exhausted, just rambling now. 
Thought about my book some more really about the plot and thought what can one do? Not write about relationships, surely? I know shit about relationshits just that perhaps I'm not good at them because once I label something I get extremely testy about it. Make sense? No? Oh god, why don't you just get it? I'm talking to you, you robed white haired freak...if that *is* what you look like...
I've been drawing a lot, but you can't know much about that so perhaps I'll tell you how the Boy who Won't Pry Open told me he likes to collect stuff people hand him in the street so today I put a Deaf Card I was given, erm, that I was asked to donate to have basically, I put that in his now-not-so empty pigeonhole tonight, I was supposed to put in there something else but I forgot because I was in a mild rage about a lot of stuff that happened today. The injustice of the present system in which I work in, for example.
God I could list them all here right now…
Like a shopping list I’ll write them:
•	My bum-like existence that prevents me from organising anything.
•	Working in a Nazi-like environment
•	Social Politics
•	The fact my art lies dormant
•	Exhaustion and the fact I just can’t be bothered.
•	I forgot about work because of Daniel
•	I forgot about Daniel because of work

So much to say and so much exhaustion, tomorrow morning I will call Daniel and ask him to meet me @6pm, hopefully he can and we can work it out it. We can all work it out, I can't believe I'm working tomorrow in box office, oh god that's painful...like a rabid dog bite thats become infested and someone glaring at it instead of making it better, or calling for help...if you want to make me smile, lean over and say...Gee that looks like it hurts...I'll call an ambulance...now I'm not making any sense ...so tired...

       I just don't know about today I'm really bummed and tired and I need to leave the house but I just thought about writing in here first. I don't know why, just maybe because I had to check the bank and email and thought about here. I've been reading a lot about that Klez virus, I haven't been infected, I've actually just been blasé about the whole thing. Feel blasé about everything, just looking forward to my nap on the train...Saw the Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets trailer, that was the highlight of Thursday night. I think I'm going to just sit here and feel how much that realisation weighs upon me. Please Loz, please bring me some medicine to make it all better, you mole.
It will all work out I'm sure, I promised her I'll paint some more so I'll concentrate on that. More later.

       Hey well you know, uh, yeah. The ignoring thing is really working out for me, ignore your problems with booze and constant living on the streets, forget you have a home a mother who thinks you're fucking for a living (Mum, what are you talking about?, no really) and forget everything that you think you oughta have and just be happy with what you've got. Spent all last night drawing and boy, I drew the best John Lennon type drawing (What does that mean, Been?) and a picture of a gothed up Ron, I honestly think he would be such a Sex Pistol. Black pens, technical pens, a lot of cigarettes and green cordial listening to Been talk about her mother and seeing her laugh when I paraded around in her mothers leopard print dressing gown. You know, sometimes I think God is one cruel cruel fucker.
Well what happened, read Jacqui's tarot and man, you know, she is really generous, but she is picky with who she gives out to, what can one say about that? Can I say that's wrong? Or is it like the song? You know:
 
"Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes" but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
 
Just something from John to you, confuse me even further, but not really. Tarot reading is actually quite an art and I enjoy doing it, I really respect the cards, I think the cards are actually quite spiritual, or perhaps I think I'm more perceptive than I originally thought I was...Gee that's a side of me some people don't understand, the whole trying to understand the world through a mystical sense, it just makes more sense to me than the whole economical rationalisation, you know, sorry. Sorry Sorry, but you know I'm just trying me out and it doesn't matter to me, if no one understands. None of their fucking concern anyways.  I think Jacqui will somewhat tear all the black shit around her, come out of that needy womb, she has to or suffer the wrath of all her dead rock stars. 
Can you imagine me nodding seriously then? Har neither can I.
Sometimes I really think it's just me. I'm getting closer to people these days and its somewhat suffocating me. I miss being alone so much. I've been alone for so long, with fleeting friends and somewhat abortive experiences, and what can I say? It's what I'm used to, but this is different and somewhat more rewarding in that artistic way. Yeah. I really think so.
Heard a funny story from Brad, ah Jesus you know, it's just so hilarious. I'll tell it the way he told me.
"Oh man, you know how I told you I was going to see her tonight?"
"Dana, right?"
"I fucking hate her"
"Yeah I know"
"Went to the hotel where she was meeting me, did it in the car and then while we were going to her hotel room, she pulls me up near a fire exit doorway in the corridor and starts going down on me"
-I take a long sip of whisky at this point-
"So I'm smoking a cigarette and - Want one?"
"Sure"
"Oh, the lighter"
"Got it"
"Okay, so you know I'm smoking and she's going down on me and then she tells me the grossest thing I have ever heard come out of a woman's mouth"
"Hmm"
"Well, you know she isn't getting much work as a lingerie model these days because they think she is too big, but she's a perfect size 8, fuck!"
"2D Brad"
"Yeah I fucking hate her! and so she is freaking out, she hasn't eaten in like 72 hours and she's gone fucking crazy with all the speed she's on and all the rest""
- I nearly choke laughing on my drink at that point-
"So when I come she says 'That's the first warm meal I've had in days"
Har Har.
"Yeah I know, she couldn't take the second load and dribbled on my favorite singlet! Look! she made me discolour it! The spots are pink! The fucking bitch!"
"I can't see shit"
"You can see it in better lighting" (We were at a bar, later he showed me under the lights under the pool tables and yes it was pink, my request now is to the guys who read this, is this even possible? How can cum act like bleach? That's really   wrong    not to mention     toxic   . Remind me never to go down on Brad.
"Hah."
"Ryan said I was a spoiled spoiled child"
"Well Brad, Gee, I don't know...Jerry" 

Goodnight.

       This is so pointless, I don't know what to do about anything right now, I'm just so depressed about everything, you know, it's just pointless feelings; I wish I didn't have any. I wish that I was cold and indifferent and thus nothing would affect me and I could continue to go through life with nothing but the shirt on my back. Damn these dreams and visions and wishes and yearnings and desires and all the rest. Damn it all to hell. Ah you know I don't mean it. Ah you know I do. Do I even have the balls, after all, to go for it rather than to leave it to "My Pathetic Fate"? Am I the Walrus? Went to Been's party on Saturday and it was all going really well, until Paranoia came and fucked the whole godamn thing! Paranoia was actually personified in one person who I don't even want to address anymore because he turned out to be such a twat. I hate people like that, the elitists and the rude, just makes me totally sick. Felt like pushing him into a corner and saying “Where do you get off buddy? Where did your ego swallow up you etiquette?” He’s pretty stupid too, calling me a stupid idiot just because I didn’t like Machina. He could go fuck a carrot for all that fucking  means to me . So you know, that was a messy bump in the road, I got over that pretty quickly don't you think? Phew, and here I was wishing I was a guy instead of living with these you know, over amplified bullshit insecurities. Stupid asshole, acting like an interest from me is a curse and disease; I hope someone truly hurts him enough to knock some compassion into him.
But you know, I'm pretty much over it and its a nice feeling to let it all go. Har Har.
Drank so much wine and listened to a lot of conflicting music, I'm surprised my lungs didn’t collapse from all the cigarette smoke, argh, God it was such a painful party, but in some ways it was pretty fun. I felt like I should tell you that in case you wanted to know. You know I am going to Blink with Brad on Friday night and well it should be interesting because I think Moron might come too, I'm just going for the music that's all, there is a new interest in the hard rock Goth scene just because I need something different than the Beatles at the moment, don't get me wrong, I fucking love the Fab Four, but I guess it's because I need to see the rougher and more violent sectors of society, the true intense, there is no real reason really. Feel like I need a more shocking electrical currency in my blood. Plus me and Brad are very good friends, and you know you're supposed to hang out with your good friends right?
Sigh and more fucking sigh, listening to Bill Hicks and wishing to anyone who would listen that I want to you know, just be him, the very clever way he saw the world through humour, it's not the same now for me man, I just can't say any more funny shit, it doesn't make any sense. The perpetual depression really fucking shits me because believe it or not I was once a pretty funny person, damn this cursed cynicism. 
I really can't say anymore right now I'm still really tense, you could play a violin on my spine.

       today has been a very, well shall we say enlightened day for me,, why u ask. because i have consumed large quantities of weed. now we must talk about the advantages and disadvantages of its consumption, pros : there is another world opened to ones mind while high, for example being stoned whilst whatching harry potter convinced me i was him, and in actual fact have been to hogwarts on a number of occasions. secondly it has given me an amazing insight into "goverment conspiracy theorys'" in fact i know... thanx none other to our friend weedums, i know that to avoid future wars and terrorism, babies will be injected with pot, thus creating a race of extremely loving, funny and lazy people, who cant fight wars, when they are to lazy to even get up and walk 2 da fridge, which brings me 2 my other point, i believe fast food is also injected with pot, so that we always have the munchies and never full, thus forcing us to sayÿes i would like fries with that"and ü also better add an apple pie and the family meal, with the 2litre coke upgrade. why u ask, AM I WRITING ALL THIS DOWN. quite frankly because im stoned now, and the words before are in capitals because my hand pressed caps lock and im far 2 lazy 2 edit. bringing me 2 the cons of pot smokin [its scarilidge to suggest such a thing} but 4 humours sake, lazyiness induced by pot must be discussed...................................in fact im pretty fuckin lazy write now and i cant really be bothered typing anymore...besides the pixies and dancing inscence sticks next 2 me just my friends hair on fire [truly] and this is way 2 much effort, on this final note.... the word ëffort"should never be said out loud in front of a stoner...............until next time take a walk down abbey road, listen 2 da beatles and smoke weed [only if u have access to pizza, otherwise its far 2 painful......

       I saw the funniest title for a blog  urlLink  "Lay your head on my Chest"  . You should read it, it's filled with neurosis and whatnot, har har. I feel like listening to Susan's House again, man why is it so hard to take my watch off? Its Friday night, kite high and downstairs Been and Vick are just you know, being hungry and waiting for my mother to get home, so then we know she is here and therefore don't live in the paranoia that she will come and bust us. My room is filled with candles and incense and music. The windows are up because I'm smoking a cigarette, sitting here and just remembering. Today I brought some canvases and started to paint, I'm in my hippie genre again, like its engraved in the inside of my wrist, like a lifestyle blood line, I really think JJ is hippie material man, I really do, too bad he is real and just an annoyingly male cat. I could go downstairs and read and watch TV, but my eyes hurt from so much light. Man what am I going to do? Why the world today so achingly out of love, I wish I could just burst some sort of magical love supply ballon and let it just drip like honey onto the people below, just because I wished people smiled without being forced, greet with sincere warmth and not cautious suprise like it was an attack waiting to happen. I'm not going to spell check this so be warned half way...
I hear a male voice! I wonder if its a Beatle, I watched I AM SAM again, again it was such an entertaining film, oh woosie me. 
I can't type much more, my mind is wandering. Wait what else did I do today? Oh  wow Been and Vick brought mountains and mountains of food, well eggs on wholemeal toast with tomatoe sauce and well the candles are still burning but now there is a much harsher light, well then I think I could you know...Okay I'll stop there.
Too busy eating!
We went and watched the Archibald today, and it was so beautiful...

more later.

       I was just tinkering with the log, okay I'm not sleepy anymore, you know I have to wake up at 9AM, fuck fuck fuck. I have so much of the story left, well actually all of Saturday involved us just sitting around being sick, but on Sunday Loz came over and well, lets just say that it was damn interesting, with her little weed and our Disney movies, god they are so hellish those things, I mean that must be why I was so obsessed with them, I've always liked things that could hurt me, but you know I never took it seriously. I need to brush my teeth right now, arrrgh but I gotta go to bed, anyways back to the story we smoked up and talked about the whole big thing, the whole Cohuna, the whole meal on a stick that is this existence. I really can't remember the details all I remember is laughing a whole lot, and just being toasted and really loving it man, just loving it. Because it wasn't real, and I wasn't in pain and that had to be good and righteous.

Me: "I'm so high right now" 
Been: "The Beatles are on...The Beatles are on.." 
Me: "John is so snog worthy" 
(Loz laughs)
Me: "I could make a killing selling buds, 5 bucks a bud" 
Been: "What are we talking about?" 
Loz: "Little bags of weed man?" 
Me: "Baby size"
Been: "John? I'm lost!" 
Me: "Hmm, well you know reality has left the building"
Been: "Has left the planet"
Loz: "You were never on it darling"
Me: "I believe that my one month of sobriety was good enough"
Loz: "I have been smoking since I was 15, god that's so hideous, not one day without it."
Me: "Really? Shit.."
Been: "You went without it, for a month right?"
Me: "Month..and a half...Yeah, and one month at a time of reality is all I'm shaped up for. You know, 6 weeks of hardcore drugs, one month detox program...hmm..I always come back..."
Loz: "And you’ve done it for how long now?"
Me: "Since I was 15."
Loz: "So it is possible?"
Me: "Sure. Never take this seriously, its just a ride, Been, Two of Us is on.."

 "You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home"

       So while we were laughing, mind you this was a complete stranger, I really got angry at the fact that the guy serving us was taking so long. I mean he really was! and it wasn't just 5 minutes that seems like an hour, I actually checked my watch and he was like 15 minutes, and I knew it was because my drunk friend was being an ass, backtrack a bit, before I joined the queue Been had called me telling me that I had taken her wallet with her ID "Where are you?" "Um on George, walking towards the cinema, just past KFC, hey I'm gonna go in and see Vicki so yeah...I'll wait for you" "Stop at KFC, I'll be there soon". So there I was, I quickly ordered, I went the wrong way to wait, Gee I hardly order from that place, or any place where they serve me dead processed animal so you know, my drunk friend pointed that out and then when my food came he thrust it at me and said "Atta Girl, knows how to do it right!" and then I left, wait, Been came and took the wallet and she seemed interested on how I came to know a tall drunk guy, arrrgh. I don't know, I DON'T KNOW.
So I told her I'll make it to her house somehow, so I ate one strip and felt sick. I think I thought I had ordered the Red Rooster Chicken Strips, see I like them, I don't like Possum, too stringy and it tasted like 3 week old grease, so I had to wash them down with red Burger King postmix fanta, I don't know why I thought it was Red Rooster, oh man my head was swimming, so I went into the cinema, asked Tony if he wanted them, he said no way, so I threw them out (yeah I know, it was real easy to throw them out, logic = I  waited 15 minutes for expensive plastic = Okay, throw it out). I then talked to Kate R (KROB!) who was in box office, for awhile, and then asked Gina if I could sit down and recover by watching the interactive Rocky Horror Picture Show that was on that night, so I did, and it was so funny...I want to do it again, I really do...har har
"Why is Janet wearing a condom on her hair?"
"Look its Scooby in bondage!"
"Slut!"
So afterwards I stumbled out, with chocolates and a red paper saying I survived the show, I kissed my sister goodbye and hopped on a bus. Sick Sick Sick...
Woke up the next day and I turned and said to Been "I'm calling in sick, I can't go to work today, I feel like warmed up zombie udders...help me...help me..."

I have to stop there, sleepy again: Short cap on what I've been doing the past four days, getting really really high on a lot of drugs. Thank you Loz, Thank You.

       On Friday I worked and um well I got sick in the throat from speaking to these mind numbing moron customers, oh how I bitch yeah, but you know, if only these were just a few customers, but they come in fucking tidal waves, they felt like they were squishing me and since I was feeling ill man I thought for a second they were beating me in the game and I totally fucking flipped. At first, I remember feeling my throat constricting and my chest feeling like it was filling up with water, oh man I was so tired but I've been like that for ages, so I thought after a quick nap it would be alright. These fuckers will not get the best of me, its just a job, they are just assholes, this isn't personal; Let's deal okay?  But after serving in box and miraculously balancing (I don't know I DON'T KNOW)  I stumbled to the Shellbourne Hotel to wish my friend Stephen a Happy Birthday, so with a vodka and orange and a belly-full of Vanilla Latte I washed down two huge caps of paracetamol. 
Well the night was kinda fancy free after that. Her Her

I remember watching Germany and USA play soccer on this massive screen and thought, why is a little black and white ball bringing people together? Hmmm. Can I interpret this? Perhaps not without a R-rated sticker. Coincidently, I also remember staring at Belinda and thinking, is she lonely? an elitist? a snob? a boring person? a closed door? confused? misunderstood? Well, who cares? Been says we're leaving...Can't handle that place, for many reasons and they are all paranoid. It's like constant watch. Eyes everywhere and mostly on themselves, blah blah blah. Told Been I was feeling too sick to go to the Mocha Club down on Hunter that I was walking to George and hailing a cab "Back to my place?" "Yeah back to yours" so she places her keys on my neck, tells me to drink some tea and watch TV till she gets there or sleeps or whatever, she rambled on for awhile, by this stage my legs were dragging the ground and my chest was so tight, mind you I was dragging a cigarette down pretty heavily at this point, so you know, I sod down past Kent St onto George St looking at all the Taxi Cabs, fuck how I hate cabbies, I think they are all scam artists who drive either with an upped illegal meter (these are the cabbies that drive like a fucking maniac while dribbling their English) and there are the other ones who drive so slowly they make you want to shout out in some sort of rabid rant, like, I could have gotten out and walked faster, thanks you money grabbing ASSHOLE. I just couldn't jump into any cab eh, just couldn't do it, all these horrid cabbie stories too, but I thought, I should at least try right? So with my alcohol laden paracetamol drugged mind I asked every taxi while I was standing on a No Standing Zone on the road, yeah I tried, I tried (No? Okay) I tried, leave me alone. So how was I going to get there? Since I couldn't get a Taxi, fuck walking so I wasn't going to get a train, my steps took me to KFC where I met a drunk hungry guy who was wearing a suit, I wanted my $3.65 "Possum Strips" "Haha I want my Two Piece of Possum Feed!" and we joked how it wasn't really fast food either since "Albert there is taking his sweet fucking time! Hurry up I'm STARVING!" he really gave the staff a hard time, I was just commenting on their incompetence as any civilized person would, by mainly attacking the company which fucks it all up to begin with. Right?
Anyways I will have to go on to part two tomorrow...too tired...too sick...etc..etc...

       Anyways, just being around, thought that perhaps I'm doing it all wrong, thought that there is not much distribution in the way of our feelings, thought that perhaps God is such an integral part of me that I don't have to pray anymore, and for what? Thought perhaps that talent is a myriad of perceptions that takes on many forms, and who is the elitist snob to classify them all? I don't know just little things like painting a lot lately and drinking white wine and just chilling out, it’s a grand slow down from the shooting lifestyle of a month ago, just cruising now with very little bumps just cruising. Would write more but am tired, have to teach and possibly work/possibly go out tomorrow. Newtown Indian food...yum...
Went upstairs to a Beatles fan’s study and was amazed…to love I mean truly love a band…I had no idea.

       Oh you know, what can I say? I'm addicted to coffee, just bumming around buzzing and seeing people, nothing to report on except that well I'm going to be working a lot tomorrow and I just don't know how I'm going to fucking cope. Thought about an idea on Hoyts and just don't know how we're going to pull it off, if we don't start somewhere small first, like the guy who directed From Dawn till Dusk, what's his name again? Robert Rodriguez. Just so many ideas and so many good things that can happen etc, etc. Thought about some panels that represent Beatles songs, stuff like that. Nothing is cohesive or together right now, will report when it gets a bit better.

       I lived through it, I lived through it! I managed to go through this week collecting the moments that make up my life and learnt from them! I managed to wake up and think that everything in life is meant to be learnt and to go and make the best of it, I managed to just squeeze it and love it and see and all the rest. I managed to do a day shift! The whole crazy 8 hours of it without wanting to shoot a manager! I just floated through, felt nothing, cared for noone just those whose love radiates and are thus such a part of me, I - what the hell?! my mouse was moving byitself! I think blogger is actually been hacked into. That's pretty weird why would anyone try to hack anything? I don't know, I got this email saying that David Macghan, I know who's alias that is and so I trust it, made a blog and wanted me to participate, I'm sitting there thinking that it's Brian and so I go there and well see if I should post something and there is nothing there...
I think people are bored with the internet and so therefore try and destroy it.
Mmm a virus with shoes, I believe the quote goes...
I have to go and reboot and clean this computer out so I will be back in the wee hours.

       This is interesting, how can you hate someone you love? I just wish I was somewhere where I could just shake it, and loose it and yell at it. I wish I could just stick my finger up and say, WHY DO YOU LOVE ME? We are in this state of development where the innocent by stand is questioned by everyone, you see I'm a natural laid back kinda girl and everyone fucking hates that, why should I, just you know, be around so damn much? Why do I have to be so freaking perfect? Har! But it’s because I love all of you, I do, and it's my fucking ART you know to pretend to hate you. Sound cryptic enough? Good! Then it’s not just me who doesn't understand! 
I remember my past with this, melancholy regretfulness, I was such a stupid kid, really. Any...ways... Worked today. There some banality for you, watched "Spirit", the new Dreamworks movie, it really sucked, someone should just kill Bryan Adams, please. Oh please. Rusty hook, sleeping pills, liposuction his vocal chords just make the motherfucker shut the hell up or DIE, either one, I don't care. Make him sell maple syrup for a living, make him retire, just anything. I know that I didn't have to see the movie, but I did anyways, and once I sat down I wasn't going to get up. Anyways, who cares, I am totally over rude people, it's just so much nicer, well it feels better, to feel sorry for them than to hate them. Wow. What a revelation. Hmm.
Did I mention my sister brought me a Snape doll? I love Snape, I just can't wait for the Chamber of Secrets to open here in Sydney on November 28th. How many days is that? Wait I'll find out. 4 months and 20 days. Ergh that's 142 days, really that is just so cruel. Tomorrow I'm going to watch "The Importance of Being Ernest", at 1:15 pm, hopefully that will be a better film, I don't know, I like Reese, she's really cool, well at least I think so.
Last night I slept in a wet bed, because I spilt Been's water, amidst cigarette ash, I woke up, and well when I got home from work, on the train to Strathfield, this old guy of like 34 years of age propositioned sex to me. It made my skin crawl and I felt so vile. This is what society has been reduced to...the many million of pathetic slugs that roam and spittle over this barren and decayed pestilent fetid...RUINS....I hate it sometimes, because they try to rob the beauty of the world. And I have to accept they are the foods to the rabid dogs that prey on their stupidity, does anyone but me also see this?? 
I think that’s why I like the Beatles, they just make everything seem so simple…you know?

       It's been awhile hasn’t it? Anyways I am sitting here with half my mouth paralysed thanks to the dentist and about to get my hair styled by my sister whom I'm not really happy with, the thing is you see that somehow I have very high expectations with people, well high? Let's say honest expectations. For example when people say they believe in something and they have beliefs in relation to well relationships, and yet they go out and cheapen themselves in honour of men, like they can just compromise themselves, for men they have just met in a matter of 30 seconds that just blows my mind. I didn't say anything, it isn't my life, that's why, my friends were just honest when they said, sleazy guy, apart from Been who was all like, gushing saying that she could've met Mr Fucking Right. It angers me the situation of last night, I don't understand the way people can just attach things to relationships, they make them so light and airy fairy when they aren't like that, they are real and good and beautiful, all relationships, no one should be treated like they are indispensable. To put it in layman's terms, guys are friends’ first, romantic interludes second, at least to me, and they have to be true and they have to respect you, I always wonder about boys like the song...
  You tell me you've got everything you want

 It occurred to me the other day that I haven't written in a while and thought perhaps I should, to eek out some release, I think I am just so tired of this never ending vanity that I seem to see in everyone, including myself, it's not that I'm intolerable it's just that I ache for something more, something that can captivate some sense of perception. I had a huge week, living in the streets again, meeting and taking in, a whole new sense of humanity, people are just so fragile sometimes, it's scary to realise just how much. It's also so scary to know how we attract and keep the different bacteria in our bodies, I mean, we all do it differently, we all emit some kind of bacterial waste and sometimes if you mesh yourself with someone different for a long period of time you start to see and smell the same shit they do and it's pretty scary. I don't know; I was a party last Friday night, it was your pill popping, drinking, snorting, smoking, talking, kind of thing, where people were amazing and everyone was fucking paranoid, it was the kind of party where I was backed into a corner by the One Who Would Not Shut Up. The insecurity was baffling and revolting, she tried to get me to like her, the speed and ecstasy in her, frying whatever brain cells she had in the first place, her face shiny with Accept Me! Like Me! Although you know the moment that you cave in and say “Yeah, Okay”, she will dismiss and treat you like a begging animal, so you know, you see through that and so you are there squashed against the wall with your cynicism intact but you still say, 
"What makes you think I believe you?" it's all games and it's all about who can fuck you the most, once you stand up and say, Oh EXCUSE ME, but do you mind not raping me so? That's when the true colours come out, the claws and the loyalty boundaries. That's what scares me about not being artistic, about not knowing, about being blind and about being a member of the human consumer plantation. What scares me? Not being able to see the two faced mentality of the bourgeois, it keeps me sane knowing that I don’t have to compromise my mind, that I am never ever going to be that fucking ugly. I mean, it's just that I don't care about how fast we can go, or who we have to impress, I don't care. Sitting smoking with Mark, and Toby and looking at Grunt and wondering why we don't get along, but knowing we do and it's just because he seems to damn together man and I'm a mess, intimidation by hugs, when my friends support each other and shrug at the race and say, Yeah well we'll play along, but we know what it all means, and it has nothing to do with fucking anyone, it doesn't matter.
I'm Only Sleeping.
We're all dying and we're all talking, right?
Yeah well I haven't painted in a week, decided to read this week, so I went book hunting, now I have very little cash and I couldn't be happier. I found out today that some people are getting more miserable each day while I wasn't looking, poor Angelica, it's just so sad to see a dream crash down and burn through every thinly veiled piece of denial. Just don't get married.
Speaking of marriage, I watched "Unfaithful" and it was terrible. 
Just Don't Get Married.
I am flirting a lot and looking a lot, and feeling so much and taking myself seriously more and watching more films and putting things off, and seeing time slip away and feeling like I should stop it somehow and seeing the faces of everyone grow older and letting skank squid weed go through my lungs, I actually went again with Miss Piggy when I didn't want to, why can't I make Been stop?
God give me the strength to say NO.
Damn I had something good to add to this, but it slipped my mind, what else did I do? Drink vodka and share some light with Loz, get closer to Shag? See that look again from Jojo? Not balance again in Box Office? See once again the Jezebel Beast at her goriest? Watch Hayes turn into this wonderfully intelligent guy right before my eyes? See Vaughn again? Eating Cheeseburgers? Listening to the boys play guitar - on a Porch? Letting Grunt get us lost somewhere in Petersham? Poet’s Corner Unwooded Chardonnay? Ah yes, I am reading a very god book by Chuck P, the guy who wrote Fight Club. When I finish reading this wonderful beautiful specimen of a book, I’ll comment. 
Sorry Guys, Sorry Gals.

       ARRRRRRRRRRRRGH
I'm still fucking up, damn you plunged espresso coffee. Now I have to rant about stuff that makes no sense because I'm wired and annoyed at the sorry state of the human soul. The song (Beulah Land) was lovely by the way, read some of Lauren's  urlLink  journal   and had a bit of a laugh. Here you have a morbidly obsessive girl who can't handle anything without adding her own special dash of neurosis to it, it has to be a big deal, everything, and she must have her audience to love her and support her, all around her, because it seems, she has osteoporosis of the soul, she has no backbone, it's very vomit-inducing, this fucking weakness, which she embraces and then she plasters it everywhere like propaganda. Her problems are miles long, and every little baby step she makes to becoming a well rounded person, well has to be received like she is an Olympian, in the 22nd Annual Lauren Spiritual Sprint Relay. She betrays in between the lines, that she needs the ever present voice of the media to tell her what she wants, a relationship, a better career, more friends, etc, etc. Brian knows how much I despise weak willed people, why does he keep bringing this girl's journal up? I mean I have to comment, sorry but it’s a duty isn't it? Let's go on, All this internet community, they are everything to her, her bands are everything, her media, the media is EVERYTHING to this girl. So while she lies broken, she must have an audience, when she has her "light airy" moments, she must have an audience, everyone has to support this fish of a girl. Why? Because she doesn't live for Lauren the actual person, but an image of Lauren which is much better and stronger than the real Lauren. She isn't even doing it for the real person but for an image that doesn’t exist for an image that is unattainable, for a world around her that can accept and masturbate her. I'm sorry but I think it's stupid and just plain pathetic to have a therapy session about yourself in relation to yourself on line. And its not just her, she's an extreme case, but it's not just her who wonder the earth in search of bullshit to fill their empty little lives, god you people make me sick...
Can you see the world? I mean really see it? Or do you only see your name in neon lights? 
Oooh I'm emotional.
Then talk about how the planet weighs upon you like the stones that pave the streets in gloom, you stupid morons, the world is affecting you because it’s affecting humanity not because it's affecting your personal retardation. You are not special; you are not a delicate flower. You are a person who believes that everyone’s is on the look out for YOU, to watch YOU. I'm sorry but you know its one thing to feel the shit and another to speak it. 
This world created you and you fucking work for it, don't sit there twiddling your thumbs and looking inwards, you're blind like everyone else is blind and for you to talk about enlightment is a godamn joke. 
If you can look outside, feel the decay of humanity, yet see the promise in lets say, a child's determination to survive, then you have a platform for your writing because you are on the human pulse, not the Me, Me, Me and then Me pulse, because that's not creative, nor interesting. It's vanilla corporate kiss, kiss plastic words that don’t move anyone. Well perhaps me to the porcelain bowl as it makes me want to hurl, because in case you haven’t noticed, talking about how great something is in relation to your emotional well being is nauseating, so you know fuck connections, fuck memories. It's just stupid to live out your life like a sad aging groupie that believes the band sings about you.

       Okay I shouldn't have had that cup of coffee, now I'm going to be up all night. I was thinking about masturbation earlier, why does it feel so good to have sex? I mean it's just insane isn't it? I mean procreation, to keep going, it has to feel good, and yet we have all this history of repression, why because sex became a violation? And since when is masturbation such a big deal? Because it's not cool? Like it's cool to spread your legs in the name of sexual frustration? Because it’s cool to get pregnant? This is such a fucked up society.
I'm waiting for my Tori Amos song to download, it's called Beulah Land, and I hope it's good. So whilst I was thinking about masturbation, playing pacman and listening to Iggy Pop, I did this test:

       I have been trying to put this small black and white picture of Trey and Matt on here, just so you could see why I am obsessing over them of late, you think these guys are normal? I don't know, I really fucking hope not, that would be such a disappointment. Now don't get the idea that I think they don't eat cereal in the morning or that they perform strange beautifying rituals; (like Matt licking peanut butter of Trey's chin cheeks or something)  I'm just saying that I hope they got famous because they have such a sharp perception on the world that makes them utterly different. Like they are on the pulse, yeah? But if they are normal, thus fucking stupid, like their success was a fluke or something, like if they truly were whores but hid it, because I wouldn't care if they showed it and were proud of it, but you know..as long as they didn't hide it..I would just...I would just...um. Oh man listen to me, like I really give a fuck.
Trey is just a fine piece of ass. Big deal.
This is a Rolling Stone photo; I think Mark Salinger took this one but don't quote me.
Okay, one more time.

Okay I was watching the news about the whole Israel thing and I think it's just utterly barbaric, it's causing patriotic retard verbal diarrhoea to sprouts from blog to blog to blog, causing me to read it. I don't know, you all know my firm stance on the whole "American Intervention", all this blood and religious warfare and fundamental bullshit just makes me want to shake these people to say stop taking out your fucking PENIS and stop MASTURBATING THE PUBLIC WITH IT.
People and culture should be stimulated and encouraged to grow, not to be oppressed and certainly not to be judged. Look, so the Taliban are fundamental evil fucks, well so is the Republican Christian party, I'm sorry but I was around during the foetus Anti Abortion riots, I saw how people were forced fed that propaganda, its all the same, you are all evil fucks sucking on each other's evil supply, it's wrong and dirty and I wish it could fucking stop. Fundamentals are fighting each other while all the enlightened people are forced to see families being destroyed and death stain the evening news. Every time someone says that America is doing the right thing, I feel like turning around and singing..."Well let me tell you something about America...."

Spent the whole day just doing very little and eating a whole lot, like my body was tricked into thinking that today was my eating day or something, but it wasn't too bad. Listening to Grant Lee Buffalo, watched the Wedding Singer, getting uptight about black haired guys again, I don't realise anything until it's so close that I want to chew it's head off for being *too* obvious. Just don't ask.
Watched the South Park movie, also that 80's classic "Big", you know about Trey Parker, I think he is divine. He is just someone I can relate to because I don't know him, and he is cute and since he writes a lot of the episodes the idea is that he has to be pretty smart. Hmm. Well let's get fucking trivial here; I think my shampoo has been replaced with bleach...
Tomorrow will paint with Been, have to show her the information I got from the MCA website, um, I just want to get things started now, and so the state of my messy room will just have to wait. I want to organise my shit anyways, and I can't do that with some kind of record thing, you know, I have to organise my CD's and then my books, and then my art stuff, then my bills and receipts, then my tax return, then I have to start on finishing my Snape shrine...

Wait.
I have books to read, films to watch, paintings to organise, gloss varnish to purchase, glass bottles to collect, people to analyse, a computer to purchase, a bank account to open, a life to plan, a wonderful sense of well being to attain, then -  THEN

I can clean my room.

I just love what Garfield says "One of my pet peeves is people who never finish what they start, I do not happen to be one of those people, my philosophy is never start anything"

       Too many parties, too many programs to learn, too many shifts to cover, too many drinks to drink, Seems like the minute I wake up is a stream to the next time I have to look into the eyes of a waiting fool...I haven't had time to organise my CD collection, tomorrow? yeah okay, I haven't had time to tell you about my moments upstairs, watching Lovely Kate lace up film, she let me see 101 Dalmatians Part 2 Patch's Journey. I really liked it, smart and stuff, I like seeing smart animation, kids aren't stupid you see...Oh man I'm so tired but I really need to update this more frequently...you know how cool it is to see a girl handle huge machinery? Fuck you guys, honestly, we can do it, but the thing is, since when did I start caring? I think its the Lift I drank at the movies...mmm....


I need pictures on this damn it.

I have had to sit down and spell it out to every body like I get it, like I have it together and you're the damn mess okay man? You’re the one that is messing up with my ideals. I have been doing this all week and it really gets so tiresome to sit and smile and then hate and argue with the same people. I originally wanted to simplify this into like a fucking Dear Diary moment but you know technology just isn't cut out for those moments because technology doesn't understand the Grey and Pink moments of transient feelings; all it understands is ON and OFF. So here I am talking about news and shit that happened 4 days ago and it feels so depressingly redundant. I hated my sister for not respecting herself and putting her only valuable asset which is her heart on the line, and people who haven't even slept with a guy or who have never experienced love or affection with a guy will never ever. Never ever have the capacity to have a sex only relationship, because they get their little fucking hearts involved and then I have to sit there and explain to them about my ideals that if they have followed in the beginning they would have spared them the strain. It's just that, and then when I walked away you know, because like I can handle that shit over and over again, Been tells me that I was been too judgemental, until I had to sit there and explain it to her so she got it, now she gets it, but why do I have to translate myself? It's a sad, sad time for me, I feel like I just don't understand anything, I think it’s because I watched "Ghost world" with Brian tonight...maybe. It's a beautifully written movie that squeezes every moment of angst from teenage hood and puts it up there on screen for us the audience to agonise over, especially if you were a teenager like Enid. I fucking hated (still do?) the ever present moronic oppressing people. They are oppressing because as long as they have their shiny things...who gives a fuck right? Such nice attitude, that complicity...as an artist you don’t know how much that hurts.
Well these past few days haven’t smoked much just watched a shitload of movies, movies, movies, movies I'm beginning to lose interest in stories and just want to move on, but move where? Its early days but I’m just too impatient...I want to move out NOW...when you have the freedom to be yourself...
Not what mum wants
You know you do the things your mum wants because you love her. But sometimes...what if I sat here in the dark chain smoking, watching porn and talking to myself? I just want to do that...in my mother's house...just to see her face...
The only way to embrace what you hate is to become it? Mum, join me? Har Har.

       Just thinking about organisation and how it can just make everything fall into place, like the click- click on Tupperware...I'm pretty wasted but it's nice to know that everything is somehow going onto better things, I can feel the rest just drip drop down...God you know, there is so much to use and so much to waste sure, but then there is so much to gain and to explore, to laugh and be happy with, it's just that there is such evil connotations to having fun, can only the beautiful love and live life? The whole concept is just so over before it was even brought up, it just doesn't fucking matter. You know? The whole notion of happiness sounds so cliché, it sounds so cheap and easily attainable, and it is if you believe it exists in the first place. I have travelled to places in my subconscious you can only imagine, I watched Osmosis Jones and felt touched by pure cinematic art, I felt nauseated by the amount of gross humour but fuck it was fun. The many facets of love, the price of it, the value of it, the true sentiments you see in the rudimentary remains of the true desperate, it's just that the simple things, you know Life is like that, it’s so confusing and people are so elitist and boring sometimes....but you smile and call them subhuman, you fight intolerance with intolerance and why? Because it's so tiring to find excuses for fucking scumbags, Ha Ha Ha I balanced in box office after a lot of herbs. Har Har. After dealing with pretentious fucks on a Friday night. To the fucking cent, may I add...
Who says its not beneficial? 

It sometimes scares me how a cartoon can say all the things I want to say...but then again, sometimes you can see things some can't, or vice versa.

 
 
 
  
  
 
 I watched BASEketball again today and felt just in awe of that man, you know what it is about admiring someone with such unique talents, sure enough you can tell he overdosed on Monty Python as a child...but still he is sure a hottie.
Just look at him! 80 dollars well spent, sitting in Enmore, with 300 dollars of pure rancid rotten crumbly tea and the funny, funny things I watched just because I could and well you know, it's not that I'm close to the Enmorians....it's just that they scare me, they are the willing bohemians and well sometimes you can't be with rich parents...so I just watched and made them self conscious, it was fun but you know I had to go and go I did.
HERE COMES YOUR MAN!
(He looked so cute for the brief of minutes, you know the Cigarette Guy)
I don't know what else to say except that I saw Maika today and we all smoked in Albion Lane and I was petrified that this one posh lady was going to call the cops because we were being so obvious, I was joking saying that Maika being black and Fijian, with his bright colours, looked like a pip and we were his bitches, getting high before tricks, it was just me being silly and well I think she heard, or perhaps she didn't exist at all. (Slow turning of head....)
 
 
 
 
I have given up on my art classes, they just depress me, the whole mind numbing attitude to art, I am intolerable of people who just can't express themselves in any way and I know that life is hard, but sure you want to make it easier and want to understand it right? I have these memories of me as a child just wanting to see and absorb the world and to actually be ....BE....but these ladies have given up, everyone has given up. And sometimes the bitterness creeps and ebbs away, and all I can think of now is The Cure, and that passage from Trainspotting...you know  
"It's all okay, it's all beautiful; but ah fear that this internal sea is gaunnae subside soon, leaving this poisonous shite washed up, stranded in ma body"
 
Fuck that, Fuck pure Cynicism, it's just so powerful, and its a power to decay not create and I'm just weary of people just wanting to bomb things, surely we don't need that in our spirituality right? 
I remember Kent telling me about Heroin and I telling him how Heroin can be anyone, and anyone could be Heroin. It's the drug that becomes you and steals you away because everybody hurts and sometimes not feeling anything is just easier and lazier than accepting the cut of the knife, the kick to the gut and the scrape to your balls. Har Har. Geez I'm a freak.
I wish I could remember all the funny things we said and happened but I can't really recall them, it's a shame really, that makes me sad.

         Today's Verbal Diarrhoea  
Oh man, am I stuck in some sort of material hell? Am I the same as everyone else in this ever growing queue to nowhere? Have I stopped caring? Is the cynicism so deep that I just don't want to try anymore? Have I stopped talking to you about my art for a reason? You know that the mundane is what truly makes me angry and why I have to write it on here, but fuck, the beauty, like for example, playing FreeCell while listening to "Here Comes Your Man" doing nothing, while remembering my sleepy sketches done on the train that afternoon, the fact that Karl wore Sally's ring and it just seemed so simple, the fact the lady smiled at me when I joked about the stains on my jacket she had to dry clean out, or when I brought my mother flowers. It's just you know lying down looking at all my pretty art I wonder why I don't believe in myself enough to go and make people happy. Actually that's bullshit, it's just that I feel like I'm wasting time when I have nothing to really say, but it's true, this past week I have entrapped myself in work, I have actually done it and I honestly cannot tell you why. I am a monkey and I am waiting for the Bigger Better Deal, but I know that I have to work for it, because I am not special just exceptional and somehow I have to carve my initials on this great big fucking beehive...

I will compile a set of lyrics from today's downloading marathon...

“Out by the fire breathing... Outside we wait 'til face turns blue....And I’ve heard every word that you have said...And I know I’m driven, driven like the snow...I have never known...The like of this, I've been alone....Here Comes Your Man..I've waited hours for this ..I've made myself so sick..And I have missed things...And kept out of sight..."

They go like this: The Pixies (Here Comes Your Man), Tori Amos (Cooling) The Beatles (Just Seen Her Face) ---- then the pixies again, then The Cure (Close to Me) and to finish the Beatles again.
Felt like being David Bowie for a minute minute (Har Har)

You know I will have to really wait for Tori's new album, just because I feel like waiting.

       I probably didn't make much sense last post but you know that's because everything that was beautifully articulated was fucking erased now wasn't it? I had to walk around the strangest setting today, woke up, got out of bed, and then promptly had a fight with my mother on her 47th Birthday which can't be good, just for sentimentality's sake. I really was just tired, you know when you get so tired that your eyes start to itch and your bones just start to grind together, and it was just so heavy and bummed out man to relate to people; A little voice of sarcasm pops into my mind that cackles you know, that happens when you work 47 hours straight in 6 days, stop fucking complaining dip shit, you brought it on yourself, cackle, cackle, cackle. 
Har, gees, so tired you’re a bitch to yourself. So anyways, I dragged my abasement up the stairs to work and saw all these bright lights around Box Office and hip foccaccia people with tiny little lights and dishes and makeup and cameras going pop, pop, whirl and so forth, I just stood there transfixed and these thoughts went through my head:

"Oh fuck. How am I supposed to work with cameras and wires everywhere? They could be used as potential weapons against me"
"Oh fuck, maybe they will close the cinema and I will be sent home after making the effort to not kill myself to get here"
"OH FUCK they better not make me sell tickets at candy bar! I can see them trying to make me upsell....Would you like some popcorn for the movie? (a dry swallow) So vile… so wrong… I will so fucking quit after choking Jezebel with a gaff light wire if they make me do that..."
"Oh no...I hate commercials....hope they don't put me in it..."
"Hahaha they hired an actor"
"Maybe I should get going to the lockers, (at this point there was a huge camera flash) Oh yes, it's time for me to move on"

So I had to log on to the end while this skinny brown haired mole was smiling, right in the low centre seat, looking happy to be working at Hoyts, well that was her so- called- angle. I would have loved to have been the girl chosen; I would purposely look disgruntled as an artistic statement. People are going to keep coming to Box Office and buying movies regardless whether you smile or not, you marketing mole. Sure you would love to get a smile, but you know, stiff shit. It's called reality.
Remember that? No wait, you're TV...
Urgh. But don’t people swallow that reality shit? Don’t they love to relate to Big Brother? 
Well those mochaccino beret people were there the whole day and I got questions about it all day...it was just so lame and pathetic, and today Jezebel won, argh can you imagine me seething? She won at emotionally crippling me for 30 seconds, but you know, it was still a victory, I actually thought to myself, although I don’t give a fuck about you, vile banshee, you still got me with the truth. (I too lazy to do my vouchers on time) Either way she was intolerable selfish and rude and it only crippled me in shock you know the type where you stare thinking, I can’t truly believe you really are Satan’s Own Personal Dildo, I mean I say it everyday but really? You truly are?
Fuck Me.
And I work for you?
Oh Sweet Jesus.
It’s just vouchers, come on, if you think it’s easy to handle these why don’t you fucking serve oh Great Arsed one?
Oh well, I mentioned it was mum’s birthday today right? Well it was non eventful she was being a bitch the whole day like she somehow got it into her psyche that one year is over and therefore she has to try to change me by emotionally attacking me, so I could fit her ideal state so she could die feeling she was a great mother. I’m never enough! I have to BE HER, it’s so gross, like I want to be a violent repressed aging control freak. I happen to think that it’s none of her fucking business what I do and what I don’t do since I’ve been independent since I was 18 and I have learnt a whole lot without her and her advise, which isn’t relevant to me or this society since, everything is different, due to a little something called TIME. Sure, some mind frames and neurotic crises are the same but culture sure as hell isn’t. You do not emotionally stifle me! It sucks mother! It fucking SUCKS. She called me mentally ill, you do not how depressing that is, in every level.

       I hate my fucking fat clumsy fingers, I hate my fucking method of going through the keyboard, I hate the fact I spent two hours on this massive post and I fucking fucked it up again, I hate the fact I fucking care. I hate everything to do with this godamn computer and the fact that I use it to express some sort of simple method of expression. I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate.
I realise that perhaps talking about 1990' alternative music scene, like I had been for the past hour and a half or whatever it was, well perhaps it wasn't that important, but you know I actually edited and thought about it, and actually put an effort to it. God is all this a joke? Are you testing my will in effort? You know I will prove you wrong every time motherfucker. I don't DO effort! Because   every time you make me wish I hadn't  
Sorry, I turned blue black evil there for a second, sheesh, but perhaps it was for the best, I don't know, I still want to try again...why? I don’t know I don’t KNOW! 
I like the old sound of the experimental guitar, I know that much, it sounds a lot more substantial than the ever present cock sucking poetry-less dribble that cakes and slimes out of the fucking radio post 2000. 
There. Again, Dare I try?
The bands also seemed to respect their musical teachers a lot more, instead of sampling and/or ripping their identity to evoke nostalgia, to sell mediocre shit. For once Enimem I'm talking about you. Too bad you have it make it all about you big fat juicy ego, really. Fucking shame. Stick a label to a No Frills band to recycle the same problems we should have revolutionised through evolution out of our psyche BY NOW, because now they just perpetuate and fester in the physical reprentation of a sexually active cocaine violent 13 year old. You know, what does that mean to me? It’s been going on for years, I’m past feeling sick for it. Perhaps all I feel for it is plastic bile.
Sonic Youth, from the early 90's, had a great talent for experimental recognition and respect for music, like Lou Reed, hey this isn’t personal taste it’s the truth.  
Were they all about : Let you be me and I be you as I take her and spread it to you, because I have it all - The answers and the fame, I am  the identity in your crisis...etc...etc… 
Who cared? They made great music and their lyrics were beautifully cryptic, if they were feeding me Pepsi, well I sure as fuck can’t see how.

sonic death
it's the end of the world
and confusion is sex
kill yr. idols
sonic death
it's the end of the world
and confusion is sex

Yes…well. At least I can feel some sort of cynical aggression, if that isn’t music, you know, masturbate over the obvious and give me the piss takers anyday.
Okay that’s all I had to say.

Since last post I've been a work whore and done just that, apart from staring at Kangaroo Topped Brett at the Century Tavern and smiling to Josh, the Man of the moment, been teased by Kent. Having sexual fantasies about Cigarette Boy. Har Har Har. Smoking with Been and stealing a Polaroid of her, will get it scanned somehow. Hmm. Working is all I have to say, worked today with the Blonde Cow. She is so 2 Dimensional that sometimes I can see some inverted depth, like her shallowness is so perfect so prominent that it protudes, right into my face.

I have to get up at 6:30AM tomorrow that’s pretty soon so I have to go. Been reading a lot about Serial Killers (again) I have to work too early in the morning (again).
Where is my Mind?
Met Spiro and managed to wrangle a late 1960’s edition of Ann Charters Jack biography “Kerouac”. My god it’s beautiful. Speaking of beautiful, I was really disappointed with “Invisible Monsters”. 
Will come home tomorrow, more then.

       Something must be wrong with the illustration picture below, I will try and fix it later. Yeah the whole fucking site is down, what can you possibly do? Nothing until its back up, so don't fret. Well, I'm nearly done the whole re-arranging of my room, didn't really do too much cleaning up because I had to go get cat food and a bottle of Evian water, so naturally that took me one and a half hours, I really should be getting ready for work, since in exactly one hour I have to be on the bus all dressed and on my merry way. 
Tomorrow morning I have to go to Parramatta with Brian and some Tarot Loving Chick to see how I'm going to buy my new computer, when the purchase and the assemble is done and so forth, this site is just going to cream its pants, its going to be filled with *that* much goodies. Hmm....CHOCOLATE SABBATICAL.

I'm on leave for 7 days, yesterday watched Dragonfly and it took a packet of Maltesers to soothe my stoned irritation and trust me, my stomach fucking hates me right now.

        I was sitting here you know on the internet reading and finding out just some snippets that perhaps you might find interesting, like the fact they are releasing a Playstation 2 version of the PC game "The Sims", which just happens to be my favourite PC game, I also found a really cool new musician whose song "Decimate" is featured in today's Advertisement, um and a whole bunch of other stuff. Just really realising that getting wasted is becoming such a trip, on Wednesday night it was just obscene the places we went to and the things we came up with. A funny comic titled "Magenta Man", a children's book titled "Coloured People" , a new phrase "SMACK THAT RAPTOR!" also we made up a story that believed Margot was really a mermaid who was homesick and therefore didn't die just returned to the ocean which was her real home and I turned into a Raptor and Been into a Vampire...it's just nuts...the cocktails we make of our brain fluids...Har Har,

Was told by Lu that I "twinkled" and followed Jo-Jo Shabido on Wednesday night. I don’t fucking twinkle nor do I follow anyone. I was just there to see if I could illustrate a point with myself, and the point has been clarified: The man has no real emotion, he is a shell of a human being, forced upon this world to learn concepts he is too arrogant to see yet. So you know, fuck the baggage, it may be pretty to look at (The boy sure is fuck-a-licious) but you know, I'm Grade A lazy and he is too much pie to handle.
If I was actually "twinkling" and "shining with happiness" (inwardly recoils with distaste and gets ready to mentally hurl) it wasn't due to that fucking degenerate, it was because Been came to visit me in Box and I knew we were going to be together after work, smoking up and that the night would end up with me fed, safe and warm.

Song Sample: 
 
"...just a perfect day, problems all left alone, we can do this on our own, it's such fun.
....just a perfect day, you make me forget myself, I thought I was someone else, someone good"
- Lou Reed "Perfect Day"

       I'm listening to  urlLink  "In Utero"   right now and it's really freaking the hell out of my memory, the memory of when I used to listen to this album hours on end, just feeling the guitar like a vibrating chord inside my endless string of teenage angst. It was so hilarious the never ending sulks I used to have to this music, when things didn't go my way. Now everything goes my way, there is very little I can't have. It's just interesting how life turns out huh? Hey, HEY, HEY I just realised that isn't true, it's just that its so hard to portray the multitude of change, what can I say? Time is just a series of events seen from a central point of view, which changes all the time, so I can't really truly pin point what the fuck I’m talking about har har. It’s just nice to see how change can happen unseen for 10 years. 
 
 
 
There is something just eternally worshippable in this image, and although I feel such compassion for this man, like he was somewhat part of my past, I can't put his face on a wall anymore. You know? But definitely a poetic influence, for sure…
Now onto much more relevant news, I've discovered that Australia is seriously thinking about stem cell research going ahead, that means that they are going to test out their theories by using human foetus cells, now since there is around 90,000 of recorded abortions being performed in Australia each year (The number rises each year, thanks women of Australia, for proving that the simple concept of a rubber, fucking ELUDES YOU) so they think with such ample research material available why not? Why not see if the stem cells taken from the spine of a bunch of human premature tissue can solve the problem of disease and deterioration in the already developed human body. 
This is now comes into the field of so called moral ethics, is it okay to (yawn) take these cells? (yawn) are we talking about souls or cells? Is this planet over fucking populated or what? Are you going to clean it up before you start making people live for ever? Are you going to re-structure a system in which we could all live without labelling and treating each other like animals? Because I personally believe once you've done that, THEN you could have the fucking audacity to improve the quality of life on this planet. Because how can you improve the life of a race that makes sub species of itself? That's animal behaviour, who the hell has a soul left? How can the U.S republican party say with a straight face that abortions are evil because its the termination of an innocent life, thus wrong by God's fucking law, when they are bombing a fucking country full of innocent people? Causing them to die in the worst imaginable way, persecuted and bombed, their bodies shattering and burning alive. I'm sorry but it just seems to me that scientists these days don’t realise the true fucking evil in this planet because they are so immersed in it, hey take a look at the way the hierarchal ladder is structured, do you think it's stable enough? Can you see the gaping holes filled with the poverty stricken and diseased? If you make it only available for the rich to survive they will increase in numbers and how do they survive under the current system? By exploiting and subjgegating the poor and weak, what happens when they outnumber them? What happens when the “survivor of the fittest” have no one to work for them? The scope shrinks and the system collapses, and most systems go down in a blaze of raging destruction. Oh nice one.

I've been reading Michael Crichton's "Jurassic Park" and it's a brilliant, we truly are insignificant specks and time is such an infinite measurement that there is no way for us humans with the importance in this Universe that is just one billion steps below zero....to truly understand it. We are not going to destroy this immense planet, which has lived through earthquakes, floods, the Ice Age, erosion, volcanoes, asteroids, Dinasours, massive land transformations...etc...and not only done this but withstood it for at least 200 million years. That's 20,000,000 years ago, for those who need to see the zeros. So, no we are not going to destroy Planet Earth, we are just going to destroy ourselves.

       I've spent the last two hours organising my CD collection and cleaning my room, I've turned into this busy yelling neat freak. I am presently suffering from an anxiety attack, how ironic. Because I'm obsessing over food, I wish raw carrots already came shredded and lemon juiced. Anyways really looked at my collection and became overwhelmed by it all, I looked at my desk and saw how fucking messy it was and I nearly broke down, I mean my hands are shaking and shit.
In reality its the Real Vs the What Doesn't Fucking Matter.

News? I watched the Flintstones and liked its simplicity once again.

I have two newspapers in front of me and will read them on the train, because I think that whoever reads this has to know that there is a life beyond me, I mean this isn't the be all and end all of my life. I really dig crossword puzzles, I mean I love them.
I gotta go eat lunch. More later.

When you bitch and moan and generally turn into a vegetable, a potato of dullness, you star to panic. Fuck man if I keep going into this self indulged hellhole, I will become everything I despise, so please let me find the strength to stop it and actually just relax and be ...fucking sane. Just Sane. Urgh, when you suddenly have to look into yourself from so much head-butting, you think, you'll be much more wiser, but in reality the hurt is physically apparent and self inducing, therefore it's just you, you, you, you. Get over it. But as Zaida once said, if we weren't self conscious we wouldn't be able to grow as people, remember that. There has to be a fine line between knowing when you're fucking up and thinking that you're a precious fucking sunbeam. Do I need to spell it out? Well okay, if you know you're fucking up, you realise you have limits, when you think you are a victim and are truly a pearl of a girl then that’s when you go mad. No-one changes when they think they are special and unique and can do no wrong.
So I went today and brought an UAC guide, I went through the courses and found some I liked, because I had to go to The Guy who Suddenly was 19’s house I didn't actually sit down and write down my plan of attack and stuff, didn't do outlines and do the whole Pro and Cons thing, I want to do the whole design computer course, I want to be able to do animation and communication studies. Wow, Wow. Let's slow down? I can't you know, I just can't. This is it you know, my finger rising up above my brain, I'm jumping in and I'm going to do this and so what? 3-4 years of extensive art making, contacts to be made, Melbourne to visit, a novel to write. 
I'm just so sick of letting things slide between my fingers, don't you feel that? That just by being indifferent you are just perpetuating the problem, so to be able to be happy you have to just try it. So fuck it, I’m going to try it. Cool, yeah?
Damn I'm craving chocolate. I'm afraid to say it but today mainly consisted of Anaconda snakes, stolen sips of Coke post mix, some twisties and a cheeseburger. I watched Out Cold and actually fell in love with  urlLink  Zach Galifianakis  , but for a brief second. The movie truly sucked, if it hadn’t been for his performance I would've walked out, well I did walk out, I went to go get my Mango Smoothie. Phil loved it and I was pretty much bemused by it all, the Cigarette Boy walked by and I didn’t say hi because every time I see him I think about those evil thoughts I have of him and I go nuts. I have to just lay low about the whole thing, it’s getting too obvious.  *Sigh* and double sigh. I learnt nothing about the world today and you know what? That doesn’t surprise me.

       I'm going to go to bed soon, but thought about adding some sort of meaningless trivia in here, I posted in Brian's Blog, which I will link to from here in awhile, I had a massive realisation that tea is making me really lazy, well I felt like blaming *something*. Also thinking that perhaps I have to self reserve...you know? Protect myself but then I'll end up alone and nothing in life is truly controllable. I don't know. Tomorrow another day is wasted and what can I do about it? I'll work tomorrow to earn my measly 60 bucks and then what? Watch Wind talkers? Bad Company? I don't even know what time I'm working on Wednesday...feel like getting obscenely drunk tomorrow.
You see the big problem is that I don't know what to do with my life; sure I'll go into design and perhaps illustrate and paint for the rest of my life. But what happens if that opportunity goes because I want to remain stagnate and rooted because I don't want to go on because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of success. What the fuck?
It's another test Lord, I know it is, but you know it's funny. Like when Matt said to me "I'm so cold I wish my pants were on fire" Or when it was posted that there is a band out there called "Acturus", it's funny in that I can't believe it can happen way...you know? I have so much SOMETHING right in here and I know I can get the hell out and do it. Like you can when you stand on a diving board or about to greet a stranger. You hate doing it but you know you're capable although there is so much room for failure, yet the setting is comical. If I don't make sense it's cool. 

I downloaded a Tori Amos song "Abbey Road" apparently very rare, could only find it in 128kbps. I like the words.

"..I need to feel like a tidal wave...so close....so close..."

This reminds me of Lauren, and the never ending quizzes...a personality can never be measured by the media, unless it doesn't exist in the first place.

       I watched it again (Osmosis Jones) sorry it's a new obsession. It's because it’s so disgusting yet so educational, okay that's my godamn excuse. You know what really shits me? People ruining everything for everyone, I mean we wouldn't have to pay such high prices for films (by we, I mean you, since I pay shit all) if morons didn't sneak in, I know I know Mel Gibson and his collection of Ivory Backscratchers and Julia Robert's morbid fascination with kelp cream IS a factor for the high price but still, you know sneaking in is number one reason...that's why I busted two people today. It just annoyed the hell out of me, I mean it isn't fair the way people just totally fuck things up and it's not even their fault 100 percent of the time, I mean going to see a film IS expensive WAS expensive, HEY it WAS! I'm talking about cheapskates here, I mean cheap people don't want to pay for ANYTHING; they are such DISGUSTING MORONIC SUBSPECIES, hey if you’re so cheap why don’t you just stay home and hoard your fucking money?  Instead of sneaking in to see films and thus raising the price even more? And I think I was validated by that while I was watching Osmosis and saw a couple walk in, I mean I want that film to do well, it is so good, but it hasn’t done well because people are rats and love to feed on the great big tittie that is advertisement and therefore don’t go see it because they haven’t seen it on the Idiot Box…Arrrrrrrgh Sorry I’m getting too emotional…
After all I did learn today that my fears about Bush was in fact 100 % correct, wow, what a definite day, everything is going to shit, Telstra is going Private, everything is being owned by conglomerates and I can’t really organise my MP3 collection because the Internet is a waste of time. My nose is rubbed raw from so many tissues, I have to go downstairs and clean kitty litter, I am just so, so tired of bitching but really today, is there anything to be happy about? Even the Salt and Vinegar chips I had to day maimed me, my lips still hurt. There was supposed to be a staff screening of “Signs” tonight but fuck it, all I want is some sleep. Too much sneezing, will come back with some interesting insights from society…I promise.

       This is about as good as it gets, spent hours upon hours Friday night trying to make this place a little bit more colourful and tasteful and what do I get for my efforts? Well not too shabby, but this is the last time I go and try and change anything. Change in the blogger world is just too traumatic. Why was I home? I was too stoned and well was it Friday night? Does 3AM till 7AM still classify as night? Oh well excuse me...Thought that was the day time...it seems so to this sick cat...I'm so sick the weighted down feeling of aching muscles and runny nose, it just reminds me of  urlLink  Osmosis Jones   you know, how many organisms are in me trying to help me survive and like the great arrogant freak that I am, I don't listen? Is all this some sort of health test for me? Sorry for sounding so paranoid and selfish but come on…surely my indifference can’t stretch that far, seems like I put so much effort into not caring…
The never ending battle between what I want and what I'm too lazy to get up for...that’s today little niche saying.
Chris's party last night was so absolutely PAINFUL. Oh it was so PAINFUL I have to repeat myself. It really fucking hurt me. Why did I stay there for 5 hours? I mean really! It's because I'm a little masochist with no will, I was freezing, drinking nothing but chuffing down what should be considered illegal doses of dope, just so I could face the people that were there that day, if only I had the energy to say you know what, your intimidation is just that, and just as boring.  Boring people, just so dull, dull, dull. It was like having an Aussie Barbie at Midnight with handfuls of relatives you don't know with a cake that resembles a snail/turtle/bug. It costs 60 bucks!!! 60 bucks between 4 people to get to that painful party out in the middle of nowhere! Ah how God giggled at that one...What was the really insightful thing Been said? That we are inside God's body? And therefore I and she were the bad influences, the smokers that reside in God's lungs, therefore if we smoke he must be a smoker...cool God does Drugs.
I'm sorry, it's just the tiredness and the fact I'm still talking shit because I'm hungover/coming down and running on 8 hours sleep (in 3 days)
Take care, remember me when you come out of a warm shower and feel clean and warm. No; really. Remember me!!!! Hmmm hot shower…

       Should I tell the whole world what my two cats have done to my bed?
(At this point I’m sighing)
I feel like writing in a scientific monotone..

Two Felis silvestris, aptly named Oliver and Dodger.
Locked inside a two storey house, roughly the same size as two large apartments stacked on top of each other 
Their toys, which gives them much needed mental stimulation and exercise, packed away in the garage.
Their litter box also in the garage.
These two domestic cats, have access to the garage at any time they wished, they have access to every room in the house apart from the laundry and all surfaces/rooms that require hygienic attention: (i.e. Bathrooms, kitchen bench, coffee and dining room table etc).
Dodger, male number one, solid black body with white markings on both belly/chest area and feet, was easily trainable and now accepts all restrictions, Oliver, male number two, also answers to the nickname "Olly", is a solid black male cat with a kinked tail, who always thought he was too good for "rules" and  "restrictions" and therefore spends all his time trying to see how much he could piss people off by sleeping in clean laundry baskets, eating the flowers that sit in the centre of the dining table and opening and closing the bathroom doors (especially if there is a family member in the facility who has forgotten to close the door in its entirity). Humiliating his owner/s is very amusing to him.
You take these two cats with two distinct personalities and of course you prepare the household for accidents that could happen, for example, in one of his plant gorging sessions Oliver could choke on a flower stalk, or worse a thorn. So how do you do prevent that? Easy, you don't decorate the centrepiece with roses, or really long stemmed flowers, which not only could choke the cat but they could tip the vase and drench the table. You prepare, for a behaviour you know the cat will perform, until he is restricted. You also assure the cat's prime "lair" area, in this case the garage, has plenty of potted grass and water so he could gorge his stupid disgusting habit, which would somehow distract him from plants he is not permitted to chew into green pulp. 
That’s an easy enough concept , all possible behaviour was moderated by creating an environment that assumedly would help Oliver amuse himself without damaging anything, prevention by acceptance.

All animals need to expel their bodily waste, so you follow this trend to modify the environment, to provide these pets with adequate facilities, like a clean litter box in a corner of a seldom used room, like the garage and hope they will follow their instincts and shit in the fucking thing.
They do and everything goes well until Thursday 15th of August, 2002.
What happens on this day? On the way to work, the last person out of the house shut the garage door thinking in their mind they are closing the laundry door because they are next to each other and this person is agitated and is focused on getting out of the house to go to work. THIS IS THE LITTLE MISTAKE
THAT MADE MY BED
THEIR LITTER BOX

God, God, God. I could’ve said about a million things but really felt like sharing this.

Hungry, oh so very hungry. Spent the last 24 hours looking at the world from the strangest viewpoint, askew? I don't know, realised two things that could very well fuck up my relationship with people and they all seem to revolve around Brian. I'm really sorry I pocketed the parking ticket, I realised half way to work and inwardly cringed for poor Brian and the 50 dollars he would have to shell out, it's just isn't fair, I rang today to apologise but he was at his great grandmother's wake, which I forgot even was taking place, which was so bad because this morning, I was laying on a mattress, my back going all spasmodic, a cigarette in my mouth and Been next to me, rolling a joint, with Tori Amos blaring   I'm not in love, it's just a silly phase I'm going through... . Why? Responsibility to be there for him, because I know the feeling of numbness when faced with Death, it's just not a concept we as humans, with our very little understanding about what our souls and our existence *really* means, even can begin to "get". I wanted to be there for him and to tell him that it was okay not to feel anything, fuck sometimes its a godamn blessing to not feel one godamn thing, perhaps he did cry, I don't know, I felt like I should know, and the rest...
Jezebel now knows I mock her. ..that irritates and amuses me at the same time, shouldn't she then stop smiling at me? Oh wait she has....Har, Har. DIE BITCH DIE.
I was going to write more then felt all apathetic and moved on, which reminds me of that conversation...
"The only tattoo I will ever get that will mean anything will just say APA..."
"Oh? APA...What does APA stand for?"
"It was supposed to say 'APATHY', but you know...blah..."

Worked today, with James and Oooooh It's RODNEY! and had a blast, considering I was all dishevelled and feeling like I've shagged for hours, you know that tired feeling you get from shagging, well I got it which was really sad considering I haven't had a shag....in awhile... and I was listening to Very Ape, to the guitar in that and then to that sexy growl you know singing 
  “If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I’m not naive
I've seen it all
I was here first…..” 
And I felt all tingly and blind like I wanted very badly to be in love with him, and then it subsided and I remembered Saturday night when I stole those moments with C-B and how they seem so stiff and all, and how it’s just because I want to touch him so bad, and with one hand outstretched wanting something you tend to not look at the ground and thus you fall…and fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK.

Walked to the BP Sunday night, god that was just insane, we walked there talking about the beauty of Narnia and how you know, we were going to be a lot more productive this year, we have to be really strong and totally organised, and then we ran because we thought more Raptors were chasing us, I also had "jolts" when I thought I was touching God and it was just weird and creepy yet hilariously funny. We truly don't know what the hell happens when we die. We truly, truly don’t know. So you know that’s that. Went to a staff screening of  urlLink  “Signs”   and here is the brief review:

What can one say about the minute detail that has gone to this film? Perhaps that it aptly expresses (with such controlled passion) the various emotions surrounding extra terrestrials, are we fascinated? Are we terrified? It doesn’t for one minute question the fact that we aren’t alone, and that is a great individual breath of fresh air in an otherwise dull Hollywood playlist this August. And want to know the best bit? It’s not just about Aliens, it’s about the concept of destiny, it’s about faith, it’s about featuring Mel Gibson in a decent role, it’s about a great screenplay that even makes his acting bearable, it’s about long tense filled moments, it’s about being led to your fears.
Four Stars!

       This apple juice tastes old, manufactured. But I just opened this bottle that was brought two days ago from the store. You see this is the idealist in me being shattered, I expect and when it’s brought short, you just think

fuck

I don’t think I can deal with any more disappointments, because the very little expectations I have are so damn simple, why can’t life get them right? 

I’ll come back when I’m not such a mole. Perhaps after I do something that isn't dependant and needy.

       Waned and exhausted, just really naturally high and exultant these past few days, realised that I just can't write about my mundane life unless I live it, and so I took a moment of time out with friends and last night came home with Been to just draw in tune to Cat Stevens. You know I really like Cat, he had really nice songs, like "I love my dog" and "The Wind". I remember being so angry with presumptions  urlLink  fucks   who think they know their Tori Amos stuff, by saying they have an exclusive on Scarlet's Walk because AOL has made it available for them to download one measly track, this really annoys me. You know for weeks I've had all SIX tracks, and yet you know I don't find it so important to emphasise my importance as a human being because of it. Really, in all seriousness *just* Tori should soak up all the importance of her new release, it's her shit.
Well since I am now on the topic of Tori, I should really talk about "Crazy" and "Pancake", these two tracks in my own opinion show a merge of those damn drums she keeps harbouring and clinging to, post Choirgirl days and sweetening it with a true solid melody. Sometimes you think, Oh Tori where are you? It seems like the songs capture this time on a road that you saw someone walk across but have never been on yourself. You know, drive by apathy. Looking lonely on the road with so many miles to go, etc, etc. The rest of the songs are somewhat old in their style, rustic and chorus filled, like the early days of loud pop, classic verse chorus verse hits of the 1980's. Where can one progress to musically if they haven't said everything they need to say right where they are at? (Glory of the 80's, anyone?) I think it's so easy for Tori to come back to this vein of music and try to therapy some change into it, and if you listen to the lyrics, they will blow your mind, on how accurate she depicts that longing for a change that emotional confusion alludes. Sample?
       
 
  
a change of course in 
our direction 
a dash of truth 
spread thinly 
like a flag 
on a pop star 
on a benzodiazepine
 
 
   
   
 
 
Sometimes I like the way she says things. Damn my cats are fighting on the bed, ten bucks on Dodger. He may be small but he knows how to make Olly his bitch. Har, Har. You know, Tori is beautiful and strong, perhaps weak, perhaps crazy, I guess I really don't know. Can one person be totally separated from their art? No way, you are what you exple into this world, that's why I just hate flaccid rock, corporate pop and whining R'N'B. I don't need to feel the runny shit and stuffed up souls of brain dead consumer planted (for your convinience) fucks.
Man, the music that girl plays just makes me feel like wallowing in a hot pool of femininity, to gather strength to make it though. Will you? Could you? and all from just random piano keys. Today you know Been had lunch wit Shabado and said he was a wonderful guitar player and I felt so sad because how can talent go to the non inspirational, the spiritual leech? I'm not saying he all like that, but I am still mad. I am so fuming mad that I was too "polite" to not destroy him when I had the chance. How cruel.  I think it was the right choice, he essentially is a lost broken toy. Not really worth my time, but it's just so interesting, to see broken things walk around not being fixed.

Broken things that seem all the way bandaged like C.B, sometimes he frightens me, you know? this one guy who I can look into his eyes and see so many things, and then I can see nothing at all, he seems like a true professional, of the Denial kind.
(What was that awesome line from the New Guy? Denial is not just a river in Egypt...)

Help me Help me, Give me a reason to be beautiful.
Har Har. Fuck, you know I have always prided myself to be above the media, like on Sunday, with Vaughn in the car, smoking some serious drags, getting so lit, underneath the windshield taking about how we could Sponsor a Bum, like Bum vision, 
Hi, my name is Robbo, I'm 32, live on the main streets of Sydney, sometimes hours go by that I don't score a cigarette...

How can....how can girls just think they need to be someone else for guys to like them? Half the time they are boring and vapid, making the guy just want to bone her to shut her up. I don't know, I'm just happy knowing that I can inspire respect without force, just through consideration. Sounds like I should rule the world eh? (Tongue in Cheek)
Sometimes it hurts to be so happy.
I feel like becoming a liquid, trickling and dissapearing, to this music..
  
oh, mirror in the sky...what is love...can the child within my heart rise above...can I sail through the changing ocean tides...can I handle the seasons of my life?
 

Sure, who the hell says I can't?

       I was just editing the fucking mammoth entry that I did this afternoon, and in the meantime reading some blogs when I came across one that states: 

"I bring you all good news - a great reason to drink rum. Turns out that Bacardi Rum has been a long time supporter (and instigator) of anti-Castro efforts in Cuba. In this article from The Guardian, the history Bacardi's involvement is outlined in a typically Guardian-like way, i.e. murderous dictators are ok as long as they oppose the US."

This is a clip from that  urlLink article: 

"Directors and leading shareholders in Bacardi were instrumental in the formation in 1981 of the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) which was to become one of the main bodies coordinating efforts to overthrow Castro. It was also used as a conduit in the secret war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua carried out by the Reagan administration until the exposure of the Iran-Contra affair"

Oh wait, wait the guy who wrote  urlLink this  also said:
Despite the commonly held view that the only thing wrong with Cuba is the US embargo (which I think is a bad, but understandable, idea,) Cuba isn't close to being a free country in which people can express their political or religious views without fear of government reprisals. It easy to forget that while Castro's revolution was a worthy one against the oppressive dictatorship of the Batista regime, Castro and his buddy Che' oversaw thousands of executions in mock trials of anyone who dissented from their new government. Thousands more were imprisoned and hundreds of thousands fled the island. Below are some links...

I'm sorry but does this sound like someone overdosed on American Propaganda? What a fucking fool. I think the blanks are easily explained for the layman. Okay here goes, a company who wants to make millions of dollars of course is going to believe in Capitalism, because it relies on exploitation, and exploitation is easy and cheap. This isn't "good for the people" how can anyone with a straight face say that creating factories with minimum wage is good for a country that is used to a financial system that makes sure they don't starve to death? Cuba is socialist, the condition in Cuba *is* poor because of the Embargo, if the Americans could let Cuba export they wouldn't be stuck in a time warp, and the country could flourish, in fact I believe the reason why Castro has been in power for so long is because of this alienation. So you know, spare me the "Oh Castro is a harsh dictator, a bogeyman who eats children and rapes women, and tortures and pillages the land like some overbearing troll" 
Dude if you knew the power of the Cubans, their passion and their simplicity, you will realise that they LIKE not being without food, they LIKE the fact no woman has to resort to prostitution, and I mean who wouldn't? And plus you are being too backwards, there are many things that are opening up in Cuba, because the people have demanded it, there is now brand name food going into Cuba, but as I read  urlLink  this   article I realised that the only way it would work was if Cuba could be allowed to export more freely.  I like this quote in relation to letting Cuba export : President Bush has said he will veto any more efforts to ease existing sanctions until Cuba undertakes economic and political reform.
Har, Har, its the Dictator Pot calling the Dictator Kettle....Black! Black!

You know I will stop drinking Bacardi because they were part of the war in Nicaragua, they murdered and killed all those people, innocent people that had nothing to do with political interest, and people who should've been left alone to rule their own fucking country, the way they saw fit. The political army against Nicaragua was American funded by Regan, you talk to the people who lived through that war and you tell me they don't remember the blood and tears and the torture and not one day do they forget that it was made possible by the American dollar. Why? Because they want a globalised so called "Democratic" world. 
Is this, you know, fair or even human in its logic? 
The US are fucking hypocritical assholes, and what’s their logic? Or we are teaching them a lesson the only way they know how, because they are savages and barbarians...only we know how it should be done....
And then I lay my head in my hands and try to remember if evolution forgot about the Americans because it just can’t be…it can’t be true that they still think 1605…when its 2002…

Hmmm. Anyways I have to post Sunday tomorrow, see you all around 10ish tomorrow night.

        Mr Deeds  Adam Sandler, is the kin of Goof, which is why his films which are so called "romantic comedies" are a little bit more than that. They push that lead until it can't push no more. His screwball antics of characterisation and weird subliminal messages still shine way past the gooey mushy stuff, and boy what a relief. Like choc chips lodged deep in a dry white biscuit, the comedy was surprising and somewhat odd in their placements. That’s what made it so entertaining, Sandler has great comic timing and the script and story reveal that. Done in the style of Happy Gilmore, this flick shows a lot of generosity and warm fuzzy feelings, without making you want to hurl. Great acting by Ms Ryder, and John Turturro, who as the feet loving sneaky butler, stole the show. Three and a half stars!

I really have to let you know that I just laughed hysterically over what I just wrote.
So you know, what did we do after that on Saturday? let’s see it was 2:00am, we decided to leave Cinema 15 after speaking to Chris by going through the fire exit. The fire exit on that side of our complex is massive and strangely warm, there are no cameras and no fire alarms so we sat down and started to smoke up. We were rolling another J when we heard one of the doors slam open and so we rounded up all our stuff and high tailed out of there like we were running from Jason or something, it was really dramatic, panting we stood by the side of the Manly Beach bus stop and laughed desperately when we saw Chris close the door and go towards Town Hall.

“Byyyyee Chris!”
“Aw, we could’ve stayed in there!”
“Aw fuck it, let’s catch a cab.”

So stoned, we laughed over the voice of our cab driver, he kept making that sound from the end of  urlLink  I’m so Tired   you know, that fucking “blip!” and totally spinning us out, he was also yawning like Jeeves, I don’t know what that means but just that I knew at the time. 

So back to Been’s and smoked up some more and came up with more interesting ideas that I can’t remember now, I know I had a shower and we giggled till like 3AM, was that Raptor night? Did we go to the park? I think we did and we talked about gratification and feeling so damn lucky because we can understand and we have the luxury to not feel afraid of anything. That doesn’t mean we don’t have the privilege to act. When you’re young it’s normal to be afraid of something, but that fear for us, is so artificial because we have already killed and dissected it, and it’s just a matter of letting go of it. But that’s really difficult, sometimes that’s the only thing we fear, letting it go. 

I think that was the night we came up with the idea of a beautiful children’s book, was this the night? I think so, a beautifully illustrated book, showing rain, trees with leaves falling, a creek, all in a part of a journey, then a rainbow, then a Leprechaun pointing at something, then the gates of Hell…
Har Har. Been just loves to be scared, that’s why she sees Raptors everywhere, I think that was the night I finished Jurassic Park and started the Lost World. 

Then Sunday rolled around.

I really should clean my room and then have a shower, I have to meet Brian in Granville around 4:30, that’s in two hours and I’m just so fucking lazy but now that I’ve written this I feel a whole lot better. Wes Bentley’s character, Ricky Fitts, from American Beauty, really just evokes something in me, mild irritation, awe, confusion and admiration. I think I can put it best to that art quote of mine, scrawled on the desk in my old studio.

You have it all together man, and I'm a mess.

       I just watched American Beauty again, I ate a very strange breakfast and right now am sipping Diet Coke. You know what’s so weird about watching a movie? You sit there and you let yourself believe and feel all the emotion and messages that the film is expressing. Sometimes it’s art, sometimes it’s pure propaganda. 
It’s weird because I just enjoy film and think it’s wonderful to know so many views and ideas, doesn’t mean you’re going to follow them, just means that there is a human voice out there, who sometimes says just what you want to hear.

A hissing silence will be nice right now.

Saturday? I was lying in bed trying to remember Saturday, we woke up all seedy and shit, Been was late for work by one hour and I went to a bookstore to read about Dinasours, HTML and this new rock biography of Kurt Cobain. I ate lunch at a Kebab place in Centerpoint, then went to work to watch Roadkill.
I was sitting there watching this film you know, letting myself get amused by the plot, the acting and directing, it was supposed to be scary but what is so scary about a truck driver saying “Oh Candy Cane, can anyone tell me where Candy Cane is at?” in a sing-a-long voice? I don’t know why but I thought the truck driver dude, the psycho sounded black, because you don’t see him until the end, and then it’s just his grubby fat arm. And damn, he was white. I don’t know he sounded like a Jazz singer, or a blues singer, someone from Kentucky who never had a thought that wasn’t primitive in his mind. Actually, that sounds more white than black, there were white singers singing the blues too you know. Whatever, I especially liked the part when Steve Zahn got hooked in the thigh, was that really necessary? Well it worked for me.
Let’s say there was 6 minutes to go till the end, I see someone enter the theatre and recognise Been. She got off work early and said that she was going to see Signs at 3:45pm, did I want to go? I said yes and met up with Grant, smoked up and met up with Sally and Remali, the shortest girl from Hoyts…who also came along. My second time, and I still thought the movie was great, hey it was a send up of Mel and it wasn't trying to be anything but a movie. If it was trying to be serious then I think it totally missed the point with me, just listen to the dialogue, it's fucking awesome...

Officer: "Father?"
Mel: "Officer, please don't call me father because I can't hear my children"

Pretty damn funny, by the way that was really paraphrased...In all honesty, it didn't have to be this big budget Sci Fi thing, you don’t need the great exploration into the whole alien phenomenon. It's just a family drama and a damn good one at that. I also thought that watching it a second time was even better, I got to see people’s reactions and a lot of people were really freaked out. Its a guy in a green rubber suit....

Then I worked with Fat Tony and Shabado and for goodness sake…You know on Tuesday (13/08/02) was PAV night, cheap drinks and so forth, well Shabado and I had a fight that night because he is one prime asshole, and we had another fight at work on Saturday. It isn’t hard, it’s not even an effort to get along with people, you just respect them, with all their beliefs, and if they have something wrong you debate with them, because you do not have one fucking right to assume your word is the be all of all arguments, there is nothing certain there is nothing more frightening that an arrogant assumption. We all agree with that? Great.
He just really shit me and I wish he would just disappear from my sight. I didn’t know who Pete Best was, I mean I like the Beatles but I don’t read their biographies, I don’t see how knowing everything about a band could make me like them more. Isn’t it all about the music?, isn’t knowing and appreciating every track, quota enough to make you a fan? And plus, I don’t need the Beatles to speak for me, nor any other artist. 
You see they aren’t speaking for you, they are speaking with you, sometimes they express just what you want to hear, but they don’t know you, your identity is one of many and perhaps the song taps into that, but in reality it’s about them.

Now onto 12:30AM, Red Chris, coming up to me during the night, I am now officially the screen checker for films at my work, and we were trying to set up a time to see Mr Deeds. I begged him 12:30AM, when I finished, he agreed and me and Been ran up and watched it, I was three minutes late but that's okay because there was a glitch in the reel and there was no sound at first,  so he had to start it again. 

  Warning, this post is about to continue with more movie stuff, it was basically all I did on Saturday, that and get high, it was a very squeezed in day

       Friday I can't remember much of Friday, just that I worked for a long time, around 9 hours, and I was angry that Been tricked me unknowingly, really it was my fault, yet it was strangely tinged with Karma. I had gotten up, without waking her up, and stolen the tin where we stash our stuff, thinking that if I kept it from her, then we can make it last. What happened? She had put the stash in her bag's front pocket, and what I thought I had, was just an empty tin. Shit, Shit. Fuck I was so angry when I rang her up around 5pm, I knew she would smoke some without me, and I got positively angry and possessive when she said she did. It wasn't fair nor normal for me to react like that, I don't know. It was really just so stressful and stuff. Friday was like being locked inside an armour of pain, it was just so evil and tense and look....it even made me think that murder could not possibly such a terrible thing...
"But dude, there is some pre-mixed stuff in the tin, smoke that, now that you're on break"
"There is n-o-t-h-i-n-g in there, fuck! You're going to smoke the whole damn thing, I can't believe it!"
"No I'm not! It was just a little bit, plus you smoke without me all the time!"
"You're fucking deluded"

That's bad.
I love my friends and I love Been, but never more did I ever feel ...such an overwhelming desire to choke the crap out of her...
I know, look at my shrugs, I know that’s evil and wrong, and I felt bad for yelling at her, so when she came to pick me up around 10, so we could go for Grummit's farewell drinks at the Century Tavern, I gave her a cigarette and said I'm sorry. Ok? 

So we went to see Grant and Dan and everything was going well till I got edgy and wanted a walk, my sister was there, terribly in love with Grant, and you know, that combined with idle talk was just grating me, so we said all of our goodbyes, told Grummit we were going to come back...just needed some breathing space...
I just hate the fact that my sister is so un experienced and young, because she could easily let it all go and talk to Grant because Grant is one chilled out guy and uptight insecurities....just shit him you know? God knows they shit me. Sometimes I want to burn insecurities right in the eye, they cause so much pain in the name of preventing pain...it's a paradox I know.
Fuck immaturity, let's just go for the long haul...fuck transient space..
What am I talking about?
Argh, okay.

So we then smoked in Albion Lane, said goodbye to my sister who got a phone call from my agitated mother, got some ice cream from Copenhagen, Been's cone broke so I stuffed it in her McDonald’s coke cup, I don't know why but I really broke down and for my meat portion for the day I opted for a McDonald's cheeseburger and I feel really, really bad for that. 
But does it count if you're high as a kite?
Anyways, so she's eating her ice cream that’s stuffed down a coke cup, I tell her we better go catch the last ten minutes of Jason X, I can almost hear Grummit yelling "You're not going to stay because Dammit wants to watch Jason X? What the fuck is wrong with you people?! You can watch it *anytime*"
I practically had to force Been to come with me, dragging by her arm as Grant continued to yell…
Thanks for making it, oh so much easier. BEEN COME ON!

Where was I? Ah yes we are watching Jason X and Been begins to mutter that she just realised she stopped eating Ice Cream and was eating Napkin instead, and PVC plastic…from the cup…

Review based on those ten minutes

"Hahahhahaa....Oh come on BOWELHOOD....Hollywood...you can't be making this much crap....it isn't human..."

We stumble back to the bar and I share a drink with Dan and we smoke and smoke and I can feel the strength from him and I just think, Good God, the amount of suffering some people have to go through, but I’m fucking glad for it, because at least the one’s who survive aren’t blind to the fact they could not have made it. 

I’m getting so tired now, today I woke up at 2pm, washed my clothes, hugged Been bye and went to work, where I balanced in Box Office, after serving for perhaps an hour, I did shit all. Grabbed an extra two bucks. Cool. Tomorrow, a Dendy film and dinner with Brian.

       Dodger is purring so loud, it's like he is talking away "Man, I am so glad you are home!" and I don't know why that is, well perhaps I do, he loves affection and craves it, it's pathetic how he rubs his head on my hand, rubs his belly on my arm. Much like a 16 year old anorexic does to an abusive boyfriend. Is that irony? their greed for love so big they will do anything for it, that means starving themselves...greed and starvation, co-existing...how odd. Death to bring a better future? Har, Har. It is a fucking disease that anorexia, because a human being cannot be that lame and stupid at the same time, I refuse to believe so. 
Well Dodger isn't starving, he just wants a scratch and tickle now and then, and because he is cute and "I love my cat, as much as I love you, But you may fade, my cat will always come through... All he asks from me is the food to give him strength .. All he ever needs is love and that he knows he'll get". I love the way I can just fit any song into any situation because that's my blood, music, what was that infamous clichéd line? Music is food for the soul? Then I am a gorging dirty bitch aren't I?
I guess well, okay today let's deal with that, drifted through work, and then I saw Him and he waved and I felt like I had pushed that moment and Lady Fate was not liking it one bit, and fuck I'm being cryptic, but god how beautiful was the shaded silhouette of him.. I was so excited I squeaked Bye to Sexy Bread (That's Brad from Projection, we shall call him this from now on because of Red Rocket Brad, too confusing)  
How embarrassing. 
Either way... 
Last night, I started work with this great feeling that somehow it will be a great night all because of what The Guy who Isn't Worth Oxygen said, that he heard a rumour that C.B was going to screen "Goldmember" at midnight that night, oh how happy and excited I got, that feeling waned when Matt told me it was him who was putting it on...but still I was excited. Fuck, my feelings were all harrowed out and stretched because I felt like shit. The night then soured and spit, made bloody horrible because I was being supervised by the Slot Machine, and she pisses me off, and the 4 hours went so slow, you know. Can you feel the irritation?
So, 10pm came around and I finished work, cigarette in mouth I inform Been that Dom's number is on her voice mail, and she then says "Well my phone is dead"
We then ask Dom's brother but then Been got into her little polite mood and said not to worry about it. 11pm and I find myself eating a Fiesta Grill and talking to a bisexual nympho and her hallucinating-drugged-fucked-PHAT PUSSY- EH Boyfriend of hers, more cigarettes. I liked them actually, they were pretty cool, told great fucking stories and she even understood that I was in no mood to hold myself in a conversation because I was being punished by my body. BAD. 
"You've been a bad, bad, girl?" 
"Well, yeah. And I'm a girl" 
 
You see? Anyways, we go to the Star Bar where I grab one of Red Brad's free drink vouchers, well two of them and I get two white wines, Been drowns hers and I savour the acidic evil excuse of piss water. Why? because I was too busy listening to the story about how Red Brad got his hand slashed open when he fought back a mugger (and won) and how he went down on a girl who recently had a slash (when he asked her why she tasted like Midori, she actually admitted to pissing before hand), it was all amusing, the story how this guy ate 40 shrooms and sat in his toilet at home for 3 hours because he was convinced the doorknob was telling him if he touched it his hand was going to turn black and drop off. I mean, talking crazy shit, it ended with the couple, you know the "phat pussy" guy and the curly haired girl kissing, and Terry arriving. It is now 11:40pm. Rolled up cigarettes, in a blue car, Little Albert running to get 20 nuggets and playing the waiting game. It was midnight, Red Brad had done an excellent job of filling an Alpine cigarette with straight mull, they left us to go to the Cross and me and Been found ourselves back in Albion Lane, you know around midnight, we smoked it, just me and her and we got so high from this strange Penrith weed, it was just so potent, it made our hearts expand and our lungs to close up, made us cough,  dropping Diet Coke everywhere. Oh yeah I forgot, Been gave me a red indian ring that day, so yeah, after it burnt away, we went in and watched the third Austin Powers film and we were laughing so hard, I nearly choked on our free CC's. 
 
Collapsed. It was so much fun, but in the end, you just think, man, it even tires me out thinking about what we did that day, the psycho's we mingled with and the awesome way we danced on the streets and how I talked about Sam Mendes with that taxi driver from Connecticut, USA.
 
That makes me smile, and today I made the girls on floor with me smile. It's all good.

       Work damn you, work, I hate these pills they take at least an hour and they ignore the blatant pain they are supposed to be relieving, I don’t even know why I’m taking them. Well perhaps once upon a time they worked well as a placebo, never underestimate the power of denial, as one Ricky Fitts once said. Just called Been to give her Dom’s number, hopefully she can come through and I will have a much more potent way of blocking out this godamn pain. Work tonight, I don’t want to be serving a customer and then faint. Or worse yet vomit. 
You have no idea what I’m talking about do you? Well let’s just quote Mr Garrison… 
“Wendy, I don’t trust anything that bleeds for three days and doesn’t die” 
The instant I opened my eyes I had a shower, and now three hours later I feel like another one, although I feel so soggy. Had an epiphany last night that although I would love to be a great writer, I wouldn’t know what to write about, let’s see about the human condition? What about it? They are very much into the pop thing, the hedonism levels have risen very sharply and now everyone has defined their lines of entertainment and work. No-one likes work anymore because it’s grown too mundane, there is nothing exciting about it because there is no risks because no-one wants to lose money. That’s the bottom line, the reason why people have gotten sour and impatient. But that’s with one sector of the working public in mind, the cubicle workers, the office folk, the PR executives. These people have got such a linear existance, I wonder if they ever look out of the window and wonder if they have a smidgen of anarchy in their lives, that doesn’t revolve missing public transport or a 30-50% off sale at DJ’s.  I will go to work tonight with a notebook and I will write what each person said, to a little questionnaire I will make up. A Social Experiement to see if I can come up with a story. I’m in Café tonight, no doubt for a preview.  Sum of All Fears  comes out tomorrow, along with, bah, I have no idea. Reign of Fire I think, the dragon movie. Remember that I have to see “Y Tú Mama Tambien” at some point. So many films to see and so little time, and speaking of time, I’ve been sitting here, scrounging around for the last Tori Amos files I need to make my collection complete, and although they are for free I have been paying with time which is a not too bad trade off. Here is the list:
 
 
Take to the Sky 
Evergreen 
When I was Dreaming 
Black Swan 
Home on the Range (Cherokee Edition) 
Somewhere Over the Rainbow  
Siren 
This Old Man and Assholes are Cheap Today 
 
These are in progress (well in a queue) to be downloaded: 
Old Man + Improv + Crucify (160kbps)  
Home on the Range (Cherokee Edition) (192kbps) 
I already have When I was Dreaming, but it has this annoying hiss, and I want a better version. 
 
Wow, Why did I just do that? (I’m not obsessed!)  
I think the internet is a great thing, I buy more albums each week, the exposure of music, well it’s a good thing. I can’t wait for Tori Tour. By the way while I was writing, Old Man was dowloaded. Yipee and Hurrah Rah.

       The most productive day to date, and yet I am still feeling apprehensive, should I have done it that way, what’s going on? what did I really do? It’s so agitating, and I blame  urlLink  coffee  because right now I’m doubting my own personality to even go there. I am completely blameless today/tonight because I just cannot cope with responsibility for one more minute. Are you ready for a girlish scream? God this is so not me, this liquid dependant hussy. Urgh, get thee away caffeine.
 
Let’s see, the accomplishments, I beautifully redesigned, cleaned and polished both the kitchen and living room, they look just an ad from a design magazine. I actually did it because it’s nice to be able to see the floor. Do I feel better? No, just saw how other people felt and I was like…well at least I found my copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I like mess, but sometimes the mess can develop a mind of its own, just ask the black abyss that is Been’s room, clothes will grow identities and in the middle of the night try to rope you down to the ground with them. Scary, just like today when I sprayed Cedar polish and it sprayed on my eyes, due to the nozzle facing the wrong way, and anyways thank god for my reflexes, but I was scrambling around like a blind man trying to find the bathroom. I can’t lose my sight, once that’s gone, so is my life. Cleaning, is such a bitch, such a bitch she could’ve fucking blinded me. 
 
I want you to know that late 1980’s pornography was just so funny, it was like, “I don’t know when we are going to get to the fucking, oh wait, here it comes. Now for some comical serious looks, how about painful serious stares? Fluffy blonde hair?” 
It’s all there. It’s bad, so bad it’s worse. I don’t know what’s worse, that I watched it or that it exists in the first place.  
Another accomplishment is that I narrowed down all my design preferences, I really want to do design and I want to be able to make contacts and I want to be able to live one year with structure again, I crave it, and I blame destiny for that. How can an artist crave things to do? Because I feel so isolated and how can art exist in a vacuum? I have an idea for a painting and … fuck you know I need to work more to make more money to be able to even THINK about this idea. 
Or I could commune a canvas to Been’s house but then it won’t be the same, I need to paint in my own solitude…like a hermit…damn these contradictions!
I know what I want…but I have 7 dollars in my wallet and a need to just figure it all out. It can’t be all bad, refuse to think so. 
Thinking ,thinking….will this constant need to think…make me actually do something? Found a strange blog today, a recovering  urlLink  alcoholic   who talked a lot about religion, in that, confused, I'm just awakening from it, way. 
Perhaps Zaida's theory is right...

       How self deserving, sorry just read last post, haven't updated much because I was away and you know, away means smoking a lot of cigarettes and talking about deep and meaningful’s while having a blast, with someone else that isn't your computer. I really need a coffee and some form of motivational pull. Perhaps I am ill.
No, just really, really, really lazy. Stayed up all last night watching my  urlLink "Amelie"  2 DVD box set that I got at Utopia for $76 bucks, and I know I was ripped off, but you know what? I put it in at 11:15pm and didn't finish watching it till 3:15am, so I was immersed in France for 4 hours and I didn't care how much it costs, it's still one of the greatest indulgences I could have ever given myself. Thank you Been for making it all possible. By the way I got the US box set, which explains the price. That film always makes me think of the simple beautiful things in life we take for granted. So thanks again. 
Haven't really done much apart from that, was working at the box office when Matt Damon made his appearance for the Bourne Identity premiere, big deal, so he's short and has fluffy hair, what do I care? In all honesty he doesn't wow me with his performances, is there human compassion in there, or am I just seeing a rich kid? I don't know the guy, etc, etc. So I have the luxury of not giving a fuck, right?  I was annoyed for being made the freak because I didn't care, oh yeah and because I scared this chick because I told her that the government gives her boyfriend  enough money so why the fuck should I give him a military discount?  
"The army is out of money now? Since when? Better check your figures boy, you need money to be a trained murderer these days" 
"You want a discount? Go to that girl over there, she'll do it, she supports your thug network" I was talking about The Girl Who's Greatest Aim In Life Is To Meet Britney Spears, who was sitting next to me, she thought I was "mean". You know what I think is "mean"? Funding going away from school's and Universities and going to the military, that's just really dirty and mean spirited, and just mental, but you know what do I know? I think I was feeling like a freak due to my severe drug withdrawals, and in truth some people are just confused by what I say, it's not their fault they don't understand anything that isn't accompanied with a jingle. I know this, but it peeved me off that I had to remind myself. It’s been a bad customer week, man oh man. 
 
Okay I better go and make an attempt to organise my life.

          So afraid, he'll be what they never were  
I am at home, a norm that will continue for another month. Just a new detox program I'm going through. Shit, you know today was a frenzy of insanity...due to my discovery of too many crazy things about too many people, how I felt and still feel all my stubborn objections stick to my throat. I hate change, okay? fundamentally I like stability. I think its nice and warm and safe. And very much not like me. Anything that isn't so erratic and edgy (To the point where I really don't give a fuck what so called "side" I'm on) has to be cool, has to be together. So like this new moon, people are jumping out and scaring me, forcing me to see how I do that to them all the time. Confrontation time, people are being considerate and expressing pro and con stuff in relation to ME.  Ahem, today I felt like saying, do you realise, I mean really realise, how much your neuroses are a comfort to me? Your self hate made me invisible now I'm visible and it's like what the hell? Spotlight! Hey, Hey, HEY...Just wanted to chill out like a madwoman, what's with the love? Too many people telling and giving me crazy things, Karma being the moody bitch that she is, paying and taking away all day, Finny Boy one night (awhile ago) told me that if the planets made such a difference to our lives from the moment we are born (as believed by Astrologers) because of the gravitational pull and ancient symbolism then there are two fundamental questions to ask. How can rocks give out spirituality? They are after all, rocks. And if its aimed at the gravitational pull then the doctor delivering us would have a much more deeper impact on us gravity wise than a rock millions of miles away from us. The other question would be directed at the relevancy of such an old system on us today. I guess things were much simpler back then. Today if you weren't with me, you were against me. Blame it on the moon, Karma, whatever. It seemed like it was a very "me focus" day. It scared me, for I am essentially and by DEFINITION as a person, The Observer.
Onto other...um...well you see new romantic progress with C.B, gee how quaint and predictable, you saw it coming. He has such a nice way of looking at me, I know he fakes it. I wonder what he truly is like, and I know that’s his aim. So I hate him for it, but he is still cute. Do you see where I'm going with this? Argh! Confucius! Confusion!
No - really, really what?
I actually read a copy of Cosmo today and felt compelled to kill myself.
But do want to know something? He has such a beautiful face, and is so sweet it makes me want to reflexively gag.
I think I'm freaking out over nothing, Been broke down and me, dressed like Ian Malcolm, grasping a pink/red/purple - broken/intact phone had to tell her and comfort her and she told me it helped a lot and that she was so glad I called her back and I was like. Oh for the love of crumb cake...what's with the love!? Comfort, Be There, Advice, Force into a new realm of Perception...Educate, Inspire : - It's WHAT I DO. Just what I do, it's not me as a remarkable human being, it's just the way it is.
It's just odd, you know, Shabado was once again the snobbish asshole and I now know why, it's pretty sad actually. Gosh I wish God could take him back.
Har, Har, Har.

Now that I get it I have to go through each one and fix it. Don't go snooping in the archives okay? Totally under construction. By the way, watched Quills tonight, had a chat with Been and felt totally depraved. I think the human spirit is awesome. Hug a friend today, Har, Har.

          The Sum of All Fears    
American funded bullshit, done diplomatically, yet unrealistically. Does this sound like a contradiction? Then welcome to the world of the cinematic translation of the Tom Clancy novel. A nuclear bomb drops and Baltimore isn’t radioactive enough to kill Ben Affleck? He just got a scratch! I wanted to see Green skin! Deformations! And I didn’t want to wait for the Hulk! (Coming out in 2003) The story was looser than a whore on double rate and although I picked them all out, I still cried when they bombed Moscow. Oh I don’t know why, fuck it annoyed me alright? Although Russia was shown as an equal Capitalist power in its own right, its another example of the fucking contradictions this film shows. I guess its to show the grey area right? Two battling governments and all that, and the people? Where are the people?  The government might be rich but show me a Russian who isn’t starving right now. Why did they have to get bombed?? But it’s what the American Government wanted us to think when we saw this, that this is a power capable of destroying America, that they have a right to retaliate, but Russia didn’t even fire once! Yawn. Release of nuclear weapons is never going to show peace, it’s going to show a lot of dead bodies and one of them might indeed be Ben Affleck. Overall, I would watch it on the big screen just to see the president of the U.S.A  roll around due to the ricochet of the bomb in a nice limousine.

       Well, damn, damn and damnit. Haven't uploaded in awhile and when I do it's to find out that I only have 20MB left until the 20th of this month, and I have no idea how that is possible since I haven't used this fucking thing since forever. So what happened? What is happening? Got drunk Friday night and watched Lilo and Stitch, I cried like a little girl over a Hawaiian lullaby. I must have been really deprived as a child. That morning, god that morning, I have yet to recognise why I got angry, I had taken Sally’s shift and got a great view of the projection walkway. S.K was on projection that day, and so he was casually talking to Slot Machine who was using every hair twirling, eyelash fluttering, vomit inducing ego licking techniques to try to get him to appreciate her as a human being or something, perhaps she wants him. But as you know, Sally has had her eye on this boy for quite some time, and I just thought, when you admire someone in that trance like state and I know how Sally feels and I just don't understand how good can be turned away like that, it seems utterly unfair. He hasn’t taken her up yet and it’s been over a year! Granted she hasn’t done anything either, but the fact remains that he is taken by an unseen Surfie Chick, and Sally respects that and Slot Machine couldn’t give a fuck. She is empty and evil and she must never catch his eye because then it proves that some men are weak and if they are truly weak then why do we need them in the first place? 
Such old fashioned thinking but let's face it, it will take a man with the strength of ten to be able to handle the torrid of emotions and thoughts I carry with me 24 hours of every single day. Because we all wear masks and we all control ourselves but the man that you let it all go for, well he is going to have to wear a hockey mask and a suit of double strength armour AND be encased in a magnetic field to be able to handle all that and still love me. Not for just me, but for real girls who would actually you know, be part of the relationship. What kind of a relationship would a self obsessed retard give that doesn’t solely involve her pussy? I mean, does such a man exists? Oh of course not! Says the cynic in me, but they should at least choose to be with you rather than go for a fucking slut with a chemically bleached brain. And I think Sally is a lot like me, and why should the object of her affection be like that? I don't know, he didn't look at all impressed but maybe that's because he thinks that Slot Machine is all that...if only he knew...
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Fuck confusion. There has to be someone who will challenge and help you grow in all aspects, in every spiritually, emotionally, intellectually and sexually sense. There just has to be because being alone hurts, and hurts, and I’m just so tired of being by myself. Couldn’t get any weed and spent all weekend with a distressed Been and you know, that’s all I got to say about that, my phone bill is going to be monstrous, and it was kinda amusing how it kept alluding us. No-one had any, all promises were broken and every single person we talked to decided to give up. Seems kinda destined. C.B gave me a book by H.P Lovecraft and told me it was his vision and when I finally got what he meant I felt so touched that some people out there can see the workings of this universe and feel excited by it, without fear. The rest of the novel terrified me, in that amused way and I just wanted to tell him that today but we all wear masks and we all hesitate because of apprehension and although I am, thankful for who I am, I can’t help but curse and hate the fear that comes out of nowhere and proceeds to ruin my life. I deserve this and I need this and somehow I have to live through it, away from it, etc, etc.
In other words, I didn’t say anything that meant anything and now I feel like a 17 year old girl and it saddens me that perhaps I will never get over this emotional scarring that has plagued me since the Big Heart Bust of 2001. C.B told me of his pending holiday and I feel that the next couple of weeks could be good for everyone. I mean it will fucking shut me up and that has to be a good thing.
Drank so much this weekend and just felt so emotional, everyone else seems to be going on a course that seems structured and I am still here laughing about the Chaos Theory.  I think that if you expect anarchy, your face in the moment of surprise looks amused rather than horrified, and I hate the horrified look. Truly I do.
Had a long talk about memories with Been and Nalder and felt that perhaps, talking is such a waste of time. Har, Har.
Just read a paragraph of Ethan Hawke’s novel “Ash Wednesday”, he is so indie it’s hilarious. Will get his book soon.

Next post will be a review on Sum of All Fears. I’m warning you now…

       Alright, Okay, I understand. The past few days have been battle field, the battle and war to fucking post on this website because it is impossible to do so from my house. I am here with Mcglincey and while he is happily writing his critical shit I am sitting here all hot and bothered because it's well, grin, grin, hot here in Merry Old Backwater and I have missed writing on this. It's so dependant of me. I think I am writing a lot like the girl with the purple turds and so you know, will try to be a little more creative, a little more insightful and a little less pathetically obsessed at the very least. Sorry you know, if she fucking reads this, or if anyone from an AOL account reads this, you fucking Tori Fans wannabes. By the way Tori is going to be on SpeakEasy on FX, Sunday 11:15pm.  
Last weekend is forgotten, sorry if anyone really wanted to know the second part. In fact it's probably a good thing that the details are not published because let's face it, they are sordid and naughty and perhaps Been will kill me. Good news on every front though, my University applications are going in the mail on Monday, I've already paid my registration fee and fingers closed and heart in tranchea I hope that my acceptance will become a reality. If it doesn't then Hello Freelance! Hello moving out of home to poverty! 
Poverty. Fuck reality sometimes, it just saddens me the very great extremes in this existance. Double damn Sigh.
I somewhat look forward to it though. 
Watched Heaven last night with Sal, and we talked to Sexy Bread and we all laughed at the analogy that because he was always in the GU side, it was his fucking haunt, man. Scary deformed Sexy Bread. In chains or in hiding? He has a great smile.   
The screenwriter of Heaven, the famous Krzysztof Kieslowski, wrote with great sensitivity and perception. The acting was phenomenonal and I once again became a fan of Cate Blanchett. Had a great time watching Giovanni Ribisi in love, his face is so expressionless apart from those beautiful eyes. However the film was such a dud and unless you love great Italian cinematography, stay away from it.
I am being paranoid that someone will read this over my shoulder, is that somewhat, gee, I don't know, stupid? Har, Har.
Oh well, have to go get ready in the Computer Lab toilets where I once spent one day in the Summer of 1998 in throes of pain, vomit, blood and tears everywhere. I have to go back there and change into my work clothes in tears of pain, ah no seriously. Have to go to work it's great to post something, anything.

       On Thursday I had a long talk with Rhett. He asked so many questions. I fucked up and said I broke my collar bone when I meant to say tail bone.  
He broke his, and said his knitted badly. Har, Har and then I lied and said that mine caused me to breathe through my esophagus not my trachea. He then told me some story about a pianist who plays lunch times for free at the Soup Bowl, a really well known Jazz club. I think he said Bowl…or was that a meal he had there? 
Pretty good leads for stories anyways. Well okay, what is it with excitement? I can feel it like buzzing around on my bones, why, why? Is something going to happen? It's this that makes me unsure what happiness really is, the very fibre optics of optimism, I feel them so brittle and frail....God how indulgently poetic. 
Saturday, I had to work, so I got up real early and tried not to wake Been, got ready and just caught the bus into town. Worked with Big Jim and he wondered why I was so alienated, told him it wasn’t him it was the drugs. He told me about his purchases for the DVD sets of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs with Mr White on the cover. Both Special Editions, U.S.A versions.  
I felt like eating him. 
DVD envy turning me into a cannibal? I don’t know, I DON’T KNOW! 
Anyways noon comes around and I see Been twirl into work, I know she won’t make the full shift. Around 2:30pm, Powerpuff Girls and  Evil King Mojo Jojo arrive, because we had a preview of their stupid Cartoon Network movie. Jojo tries to take my KitKat display and I fucking freak whining “Nooo! I just set that up! Go away evil monkey thing!” Big Jim laughed at me and Been gets hugged by Buttercup, she nearly starts to cry because that’s the “mean one”. Me and Big Jim serve Jimmy Barnes when he comes in to watch another Premiere, which was “Crocodile Hunter”. He buys $34.00 worth of Candy Bar crap and I make him laugh when I said “$34? Now you know that Kerry Packer owns this joint”. Funny, I was being serious. 
3:30pm. Been gets off work, because she cannot go another hour, so she finishes with me. We go to Hyde Park and smoke up and have the absolute best time just laughing like maniacs about stuff, like we made up a song about me and Sally’s current obsession over Projectionists, sung to the tune of “Part of Your World”. We ate all the junk food that was in our show bags and gave each other Austin Power tags, she gave me one that said “I have no idea what you are talking about” and I gave her one that said “I have no recollection of what I just said!”. I think either fits us both. 
I wasn’t going to hang out with her at all Saturday night, opting either to go home or to watch a couple of movies. 5:30pm came around and she left, I went in to see Insomnia at 6pm and then Long Time Dead at 9:25pm. I can’t remember anything about what happened in between those films because you know, I was fucking stoned out of my mind. Been was at a party, RSL, being out, with Spock and her other friends. I didn’t mind, I was outside talking with Toothy and Gloss Mole, I guess it was around 11:03pm, something like that, when she came running out of a cab, Spock in tow, she tells me she has some stash that she got from Russel and that RR was trying to grope her again. So Been, Spock and I head back to that place where they hang washing outside her apartment and proceed to get even more stoned than before. Fuck I have to go to bed. Part 2 tomorrow. 
I brought some Norwegian hand cream today, and clear nail polish. I think I did so because I freaked out when someone told me hands don’t have oil glands. Whatever.

       Mess me Up day, my brain has morphed into some sort of strange chemical cocktail now that I have gone cold turkey on everything. Is it safe to do that? I just remember Crowe telling me that it was dangerous to do it, and now I don’t know, soon I will have a shower and go shopping for some fags, and other junk. But I am prolonging it as much as possible. I think I am too late to get the keys cut, like I was supposed to. Oh well, it’s 4:28, do you know where my spark is? I have been so fucking lazy, watching fast forward porn, eating chicken and talking about nothing with Loz, 64 minutes and 51 seconds of nothing. It was painful because of one thing only, because get this, I was all ready to tell her that Sexy Bread had his head shaved and built it up to this great colossal news piece when she burst it all by saying she knew because a couple of nights ago she had hung out with Finnegan who told her about it. So, “Yeah I know about his Nazi Do” and that's when I knew that I was grasping at straws because my brain has just collapsed on itself. Don’t fucking abuse me fucker. How can I hold a conversation? I accidentally hanged up on Brian the other day in Box Office. It’s pretty fucked up.
I am aware that I am creating some sort of people vs. people excitement, because I crave it. Like I crave nicotine. Give me people, give me excitement, give me something in this great fucked up world that means something. Where are they going??? I screamed at my mother when she said she was worried about me because I was going to be left behind…what is the big deal with healthy anyways? My mind felt healthier with all the damn toxins in it. I could talk to people without mixing verbs and adjectives together. 

Later on tonight I will continue…onto Saturday morning and work and the Powerpuff Girls.

       God I am so tired. This is just so typical of nothing. Har, Har. 
I just cried reading "The Meaning of Life" it was like succumbing to a sugar coated teddy bear with a gun behind his back. You know, always take and hold onto things that lie to you for a bang, a buck or a wasted moment in time in the name of amusement. Because just perhaps they are manipulating the very things I hold dear, making it seem that I don't believe in anything at all. Wait, what the fuck am I talking about? I know, I'm coming down severely and I haven't had a cigarette forever....ever....forever...
Urgh, I'm going back to 1990's music, listening to a lot of Hole, Nirvana, Sonic Youth and Pearl Jam. I feel so grimy but it’s because I want a week of pure detoxification.
"The abyss opens up and steals everything from me, In the someday what's that sound? Broken heart and broken bones…etc, etc” 
Wait, I came online to talk to you about Friday. It's Noon and I get up blinking at the ceiling, grabbing Been's shirt I tell her that we should get up.
She tells me that I have to buy her a sexy bra set, I actually think she asked me to buy her a set the day before, so she reminds me again, I remind her that I have to pay for my graduation, and thus cannot purchase sexy lingerie. Sorry. 
More cigarettes, more painful stretching of muscles, getting up, lighter dangling from my hands as Been makes breakfast and I light up the first of the many joints for Friday. She is in lust with someone who is committed in name only to someone else, and as we get ready to go to the city to give Puerta Chica her money, Been tells me about how that hurts but she knows what she wants. I quietly wonder as she disappears in an out of out stores, leaving me to smoke the second half of her impulsively lit fags, about what could be so big that she needs to fill. Want love? How could you just think you can acquire it just like that? You think he looks nice and forget about the fact that there is pain and respect warring behind the scenes? What about history? What about capability? You just don’t go for safe, for comforting, that’s just taking that pillow and that silencer and holding it into your wide open mouth in name of Denial…I say it’s the drugs you know, it could very well be the drugs that make you just want to feel things and feel things NOW. Fuck it all. NOW. Perhaps nothing is real and there is nothing to get hung about…Hmmm 
I can’t remember giving anyone any money but apparently it’s all good. I remember that on Saturday night I saw a Laos looking girl from behind and I thought it was Puerta Chica. Har, Har. First time I had the guts to call out a name without seeing the face first. Pretty embarrassing to have it blow up in my face, thank god I was alone. I called her name because I paid her, right? 
 
I have no real recollection of Friday night, around 6:50pm, I remember seeing Dick Tracey, and telling her that I was really tired from going to an Emergency Room in a Hospital and staying there for hours while tests were being done on my sister for meningococcal. I felt absolutely no remorse. Got to the apartment smoked some more, and as far as I’m concerned only this happened, Um… 
I was sitting down legs stretched out and I ask after a coughing fit to please have the Coke.  
“Pass the Coke, Been” 
“I’m the Holder of the Coke! Queen, Reign Supreme of the Coke!” 
“Pass it here you fucking lunatic!” I try to reach for it as she mockingly tries to hold it closer and when she goes to take it away from my outstretched hand, cool, dark liquid fizzy Diet Coke spills into our mull. Making some kind of weird Mull Porridge. 
Been picks up the bowl and starts laughing as I yell at her, calling her every kind of loon and fool I could think of.  
“Why are you yelling??” 
“Because you fucked up the weed!” 
“No man! How come?? We can still smoke this!” 
“How dude? It’s fucking liquid” 
“Weed Juice?” her voice wavering. 
I sigh. “Been-“ 
“Oh shit.” 
“What now?” 
“I just realised why you are so mad” 
“Okay” 
“We can’t smoke this” 
“I realise this-” 
 
She then proceeded to blot the coke with a tissue and then asked me if it was okay to smoke the tissue. I just stare at her blankly. 
“It’s okay, we’ll just smoke it. Don’t be mad because I wanted to be the ever powerful Diet Coke Queen” She passes me a cigarette. 
 
That just reminded me of that time you know, I think it was Thursday when we welcomed each other back and when she was talking about Labyrinth, she accidentally knocked her fag against my boot, sending red ash everywhere, she freaked and said “Oh dude, I’m so sorry” 
I smiled and said “Don’t worry about it, dude” that’s when her face broke into a grin and while laughing and while crying a little she said “Oh man, you are my best friend!” I think I’m really coming down something harsh. Worked Box Office today and got glimpses of Rhett and his stares. We bantered and then once again I wished I didn’t have to make up the excitement in my life, I really don’t have to make it up. I’m just a fucking greedy hedonistic bitch, everything has to feel good sometime. 
 
Listening to: “it seems to be my fancy, to make it with Frank and Nancy, when over the bridge we go…looking for love…” 
Reading : “the Ford Motor Company now bigger than the economy of South Africa and General Motors wealthier than Denmark” 
Will watch: The Conan O’Brien Show @3:30am.

       Thursday, I worked, from noon till 8pm, that's a whole 8 hours, on my break as I’m stretching a pullover over my work excuse-for-a-proper-item-of-clothing shirt so I can have a cigarette, who do I see but CB…this had the effect on me, cigarette smoke has on an asthmatic. 
Kojak said to me, “Yes. That is CB, so what?” 
“But, I , but I thought he said he was leaving yesterday!” I gasp out as I struggle not set alight my shirt with my lit cigarette. 
“So maybe he missed the bus”
 I then got the CB bug and hounded Plissken  about him, realising how boring I was being, but he thought it was cute. The thing about pathetic people is that they see the truth and still harp on it. Why? I dunno. What I do know is that masochism is pathetic, don’t let anyone else tell you any different. But you know, all these character flaws, I’m working on them. 
After work I speak to The Girl with an Unusual Puerto Rican accent and she tells me she could probably get me some stash that very same night. Now as you all know Been has been an absolute stressed out mole to live with, every night since Goldmember, actually ever since the moment when she was catatonic and whispering she could not go down the stairs because she was sinking in the Titanic, she has been bitching about how come, when we need it because we have an impending hiatus it never fucking comes our way, but when we need to concentrate and press the buttons to move our lives forward, like the good capitalist drones that we are, Har, Har, it’s there in spades?
I don’t know. 
Been laughs and shrieks “Better know!” 
So you see, the fact that after a week and a half of being in the grinding wheels of reality some relief was going to actually land in our laps… After a thousand failed bitter attempts! (Saturday night [01/09/02] at a work function of my mother’s, where Been was insulted by a 120 year old woman and we saw a fat chick wearing a fat porn star costume, in padding darling! And Brian got drunk and forgot about us….that was an all time low, we had been knocked back from 7 contacts! 7! Now you know why I was a little touchy to talk about it.) Needless to say, when I phoned Been she almost cried with happiness. Disgusting isn’t it? Now put those judging wands aside… 
I really want to explain the real reason behind me and Been’s so called addiction, Har. We just doesn’t feel anything down here in reality, there is no comfort that doesn’t rely on money and all our everyday friends are all blank young impressions that don’t mean anything. There is a deep need to lose the perplexity, I know this, and I know that perhaps a lot of people don’t understand how good, pot can calm that media induced confusion (Shut the hell up...Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I can see straight through you - Bill Hicks).What else is going to set your mind in focus when everyone is speaking a language you can speak but can’t understand? There is a whole lot more going on in the subconscious that can be torn, uprooted, scrubbed and rediscovered, and we were two beings just absolutely sick and tired of working at a place that was the more grating because it was just so cold and real. Uncreative, Unimaginative, Unchallenging. 
We needed the pot pillowed downed version. 
A much more distant, yet more colourful version. We needed three days away. 
So that’s why I’m talking to Plissken at 9:05pm and I’m just smoking cigarette after cigarette, talking about everything and all the rest, waiting for 10:00pm, debating about the very source of relationships and I came to the conclusion to why he’s never had a girlfriend, perhaps it’s because he doesn’t have the understanding that we aren’t really different from guys, that we aren’t a different subspecies and that we cannot be figured out like the instructions on a Sega Dreamcast. Perhaps, he would get that one day, I would hope so, because I like him. He doesn’t pretend to be anything but an Extreme.  
So we go back to our work place, because we were sitting down in Town Hall, under the church. I speak to the girl and find out that she can’t do it, because her dealer isn’t answering his phone, so I tell her not to worry about it, she replies that she can get some for Friday morning, I nod and doggedly walk outside knowing that I had to tell Been that it was just not going to happen, once again. As I watch Plissken trying to piece together the information he had learnt from me about Little L, his current crush, so he could weave it into a conversation, I painfully remembered how I had lied to him and said I didn’t tell her, that I didn’t say one word. I sometimes think about the whole concept of pride and how I just never ever understood it. She is beautiful, Little L, and too much nervous energy for someone who just doesn’t understand how deeply some artistic people can feel, she will confuse him and allude him. Ah, I don’t know. So waving and kissing goodbye, I walk to the Metro to buy a cask of wine, when I remembered Loz. So I phone her and she talks to me about tears and the post, and how she would like to have a picnic with me one day. 
Spring is here isn’t it? Then her phone cuts off and I’m in St Peters. 
11:13pm: Pulling a cigarette out I walk to Been’s house, my phone once again attached to me as I have to tell her that I’m sorry, that I didn’t mean to get her hopes up…etc, etc, listening to her sigh.  
When call waiting happens, I tell her I’ll be there soon and end our conversation. 
When I saw Puerta Chica’s number come up, I thought it was odd, who knows why, but then she excitedly tells me she is at the Shark Bar with her Randwick contact and that she has 40 dollars worth of surprise for me. Oh Liverpool St Shark’s Bar? 
Liverpool St, the City. 
Where am I again? 
St Fucking Peters. 
After explaining to this girl the system of Tick, as in, I’ll pay you back tomorrow since I don’t get paid on Thursdays, I tell her to go visit Kojak since he doesn’t finish till midnight, that I’ll be there in 20 minutes and proceed to dial Been’s number. 
 
45 minutes later Been and me are in the washing line corner at her apartment block just behind the pool and spa, smoking, and I swear to you, I saw Leprechauns turn into bones which formed a giant raptor skeleton just in the shadows behind Been. 
“Why did that happen?” 
“I don’t know, pretty funny though” 
 
Friday, well when I awoke at 6:45am, my mind was in this state of deep bliss, and was thinking about how good a threesome with CB and Rhett would be. Grabbing my phone I call work and say that I had an emergency come up last night and I just got back and I needed to sleep. 
“I wouldn’t be much use…really. I need sleep” 
I love answering machines. 
 
Realised that this post is long and I need to go down and watch something before heading to bed.
Watched Quills on Wednesday night, it was awesome. Won’t review it, just recommend it.

       It’s 11:59pm. I have been really bad at keeping any kind of cohesive journal notes during my absence so you know, just fucking made do with what I’ve got to offer. Apparently some people don’t understand the basic principle of my philosophy which is, life is too short for non indulgences, it is too wide for a judgement call and not everything revolves around what you may deem right. You are not special, so offer something to this world as a consolation prize. Anything, you feeding leech, you destructive virus, something that can help us as a race see beyond a new pair of sneakers.  
It gets so fucking tiresome when people go onto this tangent, the please look at me, make me something, make me into something, tangent that just doesn’t mean anything in the greater scheme of it all.  
Pop Soul 
Bubble Thought 
Slag Shit 
(etc) Brittany as negative space, a vacuum of originality. The true source of banality. How many times are we going to buy who we are?
I am having so many issues with rumours and gossip lately and am trying to find a way to avoid it, and just be me, the quirky storyteller. I do not need to mull over Miss Piggy and her deluded belief she is fucking Rosco, or the fact that Rovie committed the criminal act of verbal diarrhoea and slandered over  J Glim, just because she wasn’t the one that got the guy. I mean these are shitty things that happened and everyone is just hating people for the sheer hate of it all. I want to fuck it all off. Which reminds me about the new position opening for Projection, Been says that I should go for it but you know, the whole interview thing, the whole change thing, the whole potential fucking up thing. But I will try it and I will not cry if I’m not good at it. It just doesn’t help when Gaz and me had a confrontation today because of my slouching and eating a Mars Bar on shift, I mean I was allowed to do it, but he assumed I didn’t know that it was wrong. There is nothing worse than having a boss who thinks you are incapable just because they forget you’ve been around for a long while. Like I’m invisible, oh man what’s that word I’m looking for? Disposable.  
God I took so much drugs on Saturday and had to nurse my sister in the middle of it all, and that somehow changed me as a person, it just made me so collected and stuff, but the raw deal still came through which is, I just can’t trust her when she says she knows her limits. My friends all came through for me when I needed them most and that has to make a beautiful night. 
Been and Spock, they are going to have three nights a week together I’ve decided, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and I get Thursday, Friday and the some weekends, just because I feel a lot better when she is around, like we have an originally creative rich tap and its just a shame that very little of it is documented. I want to get film and take some photos, dress up photos and then distort them, smoke them, rip and digitally recreate them. But you know… 
I have a lot to do and so little time and so little motivation, lying in the bowels of nothingness and wishing the small circle of light that I can see was bigger.  
“Mirror in the sky, what is love?” Fuck, Getting older and I feel like I’m old enough. 
I fell in love with Finneran once again, I had misspelt his name earlier, he did a Raptor impersonation and me and Been were just flabbergasted.  
 
   He comes in to stand in front of Been, Vicki and me and then claws his hands, outstretched, bends his back and then squawks, just like a Raptor. He does this for a full two minutes   
Been: Fuck 
Me: (mesmerized)  Why aren't we running away from the Raptor? 
Been:  (nervously biting thumb nail)  It would be futile, there are more of them. 
Me:  (fraustrated)  Why did Finneran turn into a Raptor? 
Been: The question is HOW not why… 
Me:   (quietly)  A Red Raptor 
Been: The colour of blood 
Me: Fucking go away Finn! You’re freaking me out! 
More later, as in tomorrow. Now for a word from our sponsors…

       It’s been a weekend of firsts, first time I slept through someone having sex in the next room as me (I had no idea, although I knew it was going to happen) I grew irritated by the guitar, when all I wanted was to talk and just immerse, I just hate banal fucking pop rock, it’s the same chords and it’s the same meaning. I don’t care if Kurt Cobain thought he was a stupid sell out with no talent, his music at least kept me interested. So fuck him. Har, Har. I met the ever elusive Furry Ned for the first time, and it was really cool, even though you know, it seemed like it was a repeat in my life.  
I don’t know what to say about Sunday… 
Well travelling and cruising through, getting all soaked up and hazy, that was all of Friday night, I can’t really remember any importance attached to it. Just that there was some rusty Cabramatta skunk involved and my sister’s friend became Spewie for the night. Nothing much happened at work, in fact it was all just vanilla bland -- actually something quite funny happened, I was stoned and thought all the money that was handed to me through the small box office window was Leprechaun money and it disappeared before I could register what amount they gave me. And despite all that my till balanced. It was so odd, I was talking to KC and he knew I was fucking gone, giggling at me, and nudge, nudge, wink, and another crazy wink and I never felt the biggest desire to ask him  
“Why not Sally?”  
Because he forgot about her because I honestly think he is incapable of remembering. So you know, it’s just a girl thing, network the boys, like you can work them out. Like you would even want to.  
By the way, I haven’t read anything exciting and political affairs are now just boring me with their no balls antics. I can get really angry at the washed up turds, the trash and the absolutely banality of Western Society, but I’m part of it, and I just have no strength not even much resources to debate for or against.  
Feel like being with art for awhile, none of this suppressed social bullshit, I want to be able to talk to CB like a fucking friend, in fact I think that’s what I am going to do… 
Fuck this pressure.  
 
Damn I am so impatient.  
 
No matter who I choose I will still be looking for something that isn’t there, so therefore I will recount this story only once. So pay attention.  
The reason why I like CB is that I can sense a very damaged person there, yeah I know, I am Miss Fix it, Do it Yourself. Somewhat collecting people’s tortures is my hobby. I feel like I can talk to him. And guess what? He used to be so beautiful and now he just looks so small. I don’t know why I said that, like I know what a person in Denial “looks like”. I had a sudden panic attack when he asked me to go have a drink with him, this Wednesday night, like it meant anything other than friends. I hate the godamn stress, it’s almost suffocating from other people who know you have a thing for him. Har, Har, you know what I just thought of? He shouldn’t wear white. Oh God, it's so simple, talk and talk and then collapse in the world of So Fucking What? 
 
What am I talking about? I’m just beyond tired….

and then I sing..at the top of my lungs.. 
"And I am nothing...so you have nothing to hide...and I'm a pacifist...so I can fuck your shit up...oh yeah I'm small...oh yeah...I'm small...fuck you asshole...you homophobic red neck DICK, big and tough and macho, you can kick my ass....So fucking what? So fucking what? So fucking what?" - Pea - Red Hot Chili Peppers - One Hot Minute - 1995

       Fuck. I fucked up and pressed the wrong button and now my old long post is erased. This seems to happen to no-one else but me, it grates me and forces me to think, with a paranoid madness that this is just my week of bad luck plotting, one more fucking kick. Just one more? Please? Because this was a different post, totaly united with my thread of a downer, I was spilling all the inner thoughts of this political mess that we find ourselves in... 
 
"It's impossible to walk in this muck!" - Raoul Duke 
 
And now I have to ramble, like purple bitch. Will try to fill the vacous holes with meaning. 
 
It's Tuesday, and amidst purple smoke, I realise that the 5 hour long wait was just made more bizarre due to my all day longing to see XXX. Because it just shits me to have a movie I haven't seen mock me. Vin Diesel all puffed up and shiny, and I know the bitch can't act, and I know it will be an average piece of film scrap, cut and pasted and regurgitated to trick the masses that, here is a film that they can call worthwhile, understandable and a true representation of their dreams/realities. Like a piece of dangling meat, force fed into the blind, the needy and the pathetic. Perhaps a total waste of two hours of my life, but as I sat there on Been's black vynil couches, watching re-run sitcoms, chain smoking, I realised that sometimes in life, no matter how bad they could be, are just better to do than to do nothing. Felt really sad, as I sat in my own self induced boredom, I put everything on hold for that ticket out of reality. Scares even the most drug hardened person when they have to coldly look at their addictions straight in the face. 
 
 
"How long could we maintain? I wondered. How long until one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family; will he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car? If so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere, 'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency and they'll run us down like dogs. Jesus, did I say that? Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?" - Raoul Duke 
 
I thought of all of that, you know the jabs and lifts of life, the constant visual banality pounding and lulling in my head, when things stretch out for no reason, the mental mantra that chatters "What the hell are you doing? you are watching "Everybody Loves Raymond", for godsakes man...look! it's making your brain seep out of your head..." Why are you waiting? What are you waiting for? Stimulate me somehow dear lord! 
When the boys came and presented me with a bowl, and I mean a decent sized bowl, filled to 3/4 way with pure gunja, all of that feeling like I'm wasting time just vanish...and I thought...I wonder if after XXX this would be more than welcome... 
Well I at least would've killed 3 hours in anticipation...and the wait would not have been so agonizing.  
 
God, perhaps it was just a shit day, not a hungry desperation, at 8:24am, I am slapped with a $100 fine because I casually had my feet on the seat on the train, I was edgy and nervous because I had forgotten my concession card, and only because I didn't want a $200 fine, I shut my mouth, but... if I had my card with me I would've argued..."I have seen people masturbate, fornicate, fart, sleep, drool, urinate and BLEED onto these germ soaked pieces of plastic foam, and you, the ever present Gorilla Force, book me? A citizen which pays your fuckign wages each week, who hasn't vandalised one item on your crummy trains? I beeseech and I terminate you from the human race...begone piece of TOOL..." 
 
I then proceeding to go to work I was told I have been removed from the greatness of floor work, with Sally and Rhett and KC  onto the hellish box office, with no-one! Apart from The Decent Glossy Girl, who sat too far away from me to even midly entertain me. Urgh, having to choke down a Jim Beam at the bar because Been was in such a fucking hurry, I guess to get away from Shabado who was being his usual anti social self, am beginning to think he wants maladjusted neurotic chicks to hang from his cock as some sort of sick extension to his manhood... 
How terribly cliché and boring,is he with such a misconstrued audacity to think he is better than anyone else... 
 
There's a fine line you scratch when you start playing with hallucigenetics, you have to know they are made with the true purpose of you forgetting reality, so you mirror that in real life, by shutting out reality even when you are not high. Until Tuesday I prided myself on not doing that. But you know...one bad day... 
I smoked so much that, I can't remember much apart from watching R.R's region One "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"...there is one great line from that movie I will never forget... 
 
"There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. 
Bazooko's Circus is what the world would be doing every Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war.

       Perhaps there is a limit now to what you can write, well okay I was thinking about getting nostalgic and weaving you the whole story on how CB finally turned around and decided it was okay to hang out with me...and stuff...
God it just hurts my heart to be reminded man, I feel like such a girl...I looked at myself on photos today and thought...why don't I have it? Why do I always look so...never my best...is it the abuse? is it because deep down inside I don't want to be looked at? Like I am some sort of monster...
Deep down inside I have got such issues like that...which just fuck with my head because they are totally irrational and stand agaisnt everything I intellectually believe in. I don't know I honestly don't know...if I am someone worthy of being loved. I always thought I was going to fall into the cracks of humanity, an outsider in the whole realm of relationships just because I haven't "had a date forvever....eeeeever...forever..."
But right now I am really tired so till the next time we meet.

       It's hard you know, to explain why I haven't been writing. It could be perhaps because my computer at home is one evil piece of machinery that somehow hates the fact that I post on my own fucking blog. You know Been's brother Drain, well he went with his girlie to do a quasi round the world trip to a whole bunch of places I know I am going to see eventually...I know this, well he was gone from the apartment and so for the last 8 days all we have been doing is having parties all the time and get wasted. It was like some sort of strange indulgence. I'm sitting here waiting for McGlincey to come back with the tallies because we are going to smoke instead of doing his assignment, I don't think I'll be leaving University for awhile. I graduated this week and kissed CB, did I tell you that? the most insane moment of my life, when that boy looked at me with .. something. That fucking something you know? Wink Wink. It was nice and that's the best fucking adjective I can come up with.
I am just so tired of living this life, I feel somewhat drained, but the thing is that it has been a jolt, and it has been a place of utter peace, no really it has been. It's just that when reality comes crashing back so does all the work that you have to do to just get it all together, it's such a strain yet you know, I guess it's not such a bad one.
I keep thinking of last night and how we went to apartment 13 and got some gunja from one of CB's dealers....by the way I have learnt a lot about that boy and some of it just amazes me the level of complexity some males can accumulate in their heads...this vast desert of remorse and failed expectations, the depression and the need to experience something big, something unbelievable. I'm going to stop now and see if this bitch will post for me today.

       I lost a lot of "things" these past couple of days, I lost my mobile phone that had all my memorable messages in it "I have never cried so much over a book!", and my black diary, lost it in a train ride. Funny how blasé I feel about that. Hm, lost my bachelorhood. Singledom? Apparently I am in a relationship now. All these parts of my life seem completed but frayed, I have no idea what to do today as I sit in my bedroom trying to type quietly because Beenie is asleep. Watched the Exorcist last night. I also kissed CB goodbye too. I had hurt him two nights previously and had tried to make it up to him...well my own way. Still am actually.
What a frayed life, I feel like the way people are to communicate with me, are based on a face to face thing, and the whole phone cold connection is going to die out. The whole concept seems kinda lonely. I have been calling in sick a lot lately and for what? To hold onto a few stolen moments? That night we went to the Leo who Can Do no Wrong apartment, and met another guy who was pretty much the spitting image of a panting dog...The testosterone in that dealers room was unbelievable and of course with a drunk CB it was not a good mixture, damn I should've just gone to Been's and slept and gone to work the next day. I am so ill in letting feelings of boredom dictate my life. That's what it all was for months, laziness 
(A couple of hours later)
I am sitting here, listening to the sounds of Cheech and Chong and reliving the memories of me and McGlinchey sitting down laughingly calling one of the security guards Cheech....it's Cheech! hide the bong! He's a Bong Hog, Oink like a pig Cheech!
I am sitting here in my ripped work pants and holey socks and I am remembering old judgements and moments of silence where I would think that everything would go wrong. I have to go to work and get everything ready so in reality I don't have much time. I want to say that I am at the moment afraid of being afraid and commitment and if you do not know what that could possibly mean think of yourself as a shadow without a light, once the light hits you will reach a level of self growth but at the same time your existence will never be solitary it will be filled with a light that you do not know when its going to be put out. Listen to me I say! Love only you and if someone comes along don't ever love them enough to give up your existence for, that's what real true love is about, being around each other not BEING the same person.... Fuck. Been is calling me and I have to hide the Raptors....bye!

       Fucking insanity! Sometimes the neurosis sounds so hollow and retarded when you re-read it and it falls on your ears, man the ugly thoughts that come attached to it...Let it go! I have never been obsessed with consuming another person sexually like I am right now, and the thoughts that perhaps that this relationship with CB is all based on obsession, don't you think that the thought hasn't occurred in my straight mind... 
Obsession! 
So you know, the drugs and the rock and roll and the Garage Days after party and the films and the moments with a South Australian poet and watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show with Fear Most, the kindly deviant bookseller, and wanting to fuck CB behind a karaoke bar, watching Been weep and feeling lost, I mean all these things have happened in the last week, and they are over flowing my mind man, all these things that are captured in my written journal because I am never home to write anything down digitally. I know that the last entries have been so patented and boring, and downright pickled and brined on drugs. I know this! 
What else can I say that my life is so scattered that any resemblance to a ritual have vanished. 
No more rituals! I feel like I have left one thousand years behind, in a monastery somewhere. Anyways I have to get ready for work. 
Tonight I will get all my journal entries down right and post one up tonight. 
Tomorrow...one more time McGlinchey...

 I want to go back to that time in Sydney Park where after me and CB spent hours bare skinned and under blankets just kissing and talking about crazy it was to feel so deeply after well…steps. It was such a step filled method on how one day he just decided to befriend me the way you befriend a hanging out partner. Then, it just got intense and sensual, man, how I distrust that amount of intensity in such a short amount of time, but you know, how long was it going to take? I had wanted this man for how long now? I am thankful and all, deep down I am very conservative, its because after years of being wild and jumping head first, well you know, a fear is a fear of getting hurt again. It’s nice to be held and to be kissed with passion it’s just amazing to share. Fuck. How did it happen? All this attention on me all of a sudden, far out! Go away it was just so safe to be solitary, but you know, how frustratingly lonely. Well, it’s just a matter of time and stuff, I’m feeling really reflective. 
 
I had to work at 10am that day (Tuesday 22/10) and then had to deal with tight assed supervisors and frantic elitist managers and it really just fucking pissed me off, the sound of slaves and importance being thrown around like they all mattered and I was actually being good and being cooperative and it nearly killed me. G-Gay was there and he saw me get into trouble and being late and all the terrible things that happened and I saw my chance for projection grow slimmer. 
Too much.

       I've been at home and have felt really fucking lazy, you know that only one shower could fix all that. Laundry and the mundane are coming back with the ever present little problems. I don't know, am I beyond them or just addicted to them? Got a call from Been awhile ago telling me that I must attend the House Warming in Pendle Hill, I must, I must! But the truth is that financially I won't be able to go. Financially I won't be able to go many places since I have to go to Melbourne to see Paul McCartney on stage (Cost? Unsure). My sister is coming too and I feel bad because I don't want any part of her to come just because of attached memories in Melbourne. Silly huh? Because let's look at it, it's over with, the boy in Melbourne etc, all that is over. But you know, Melbourne and my sister...fuck. Old Times. 
I am very good with money, it's in my sun sign what can I say? What’s with my questions? I just hang around people who are really bad with money. But I don't want to hate them no really I don't, and I know deep down it’s not hate, just impatience and a wish for me to be stronger and say NO (No Been! I can’t do it! I can’t afford it! She thinks its so easy because I earn more than her and it isn’t so). Limitations are hard to face when you are stoned or when you are a true hedonist at heart, and when the money comes easy you get a little more selfish each time, it's just one of the consequences of the game. So you know, this time all the energy to sacrifice are going to come back, and let’s be fair about budgeting, because more wasted money and I am going to just weep at the faulty nature of Capitalism. I work too damn hard and deal with too much shit to stare at empty hands and reaching orifices crying “Cigarettes! Cigarettes!”. Between me and Been, an easy one grand on cigarettes, it’s just not cool.
I watched Primal Fear today my sister has it on DVD and uh, I don’t think I liked it, I thought the acting was too shallow and Edward Norton as brilliantly as he played the role of Aaron/Roy, the lines he said were not you know, credible enough, there was no real intensity. He didn’t make me really feel anything except well, a sense of accomplishment that I could see straight through the character. So no, there was no twist for me, I just can’t help but analytically think when people shove a movie in my face. But yeah the acting by Norton was good, not great, and that’s because the screenwriter Steve Shagan is a fucking moron with the articulacy level of a fruit fly. The director wasn’t that hot either. I didn’t hate the film but it was very disappointing

       I found my phone, it was buried with 13 missed calls and 17 messages in the back of Fleet’s car. No luck with the journal. Oh well. I just deleted what I was going to write, and that somewhat depressed me from continuing. I have been through so much that perhaps I can not tell you through words, I have slept in the arms of a boy who absolutly loves me and who I just have no words to express the fear that brings to me and the joy, I feel proud of it. Around 7am today I was still with him and you want to know...if you want to know, the intensity of it all, I just wish that you could imagine two blue eyes truthfully expressing how they see you as beautiful and the kisses, the kisses are more than good, they are insane. You bottle this shit up and you could get rid of any negativity…pretty amazing. 
I know that when we finally...get together in that final way, it's just going to make me emotionally shatter, let's hope he is ready for it. What am I saying? I hope I’m ready for it. It’s going to be so good, I can feel it, the anticipation of totally and physically expressing a deep affection, and it’s that, you know, an affection, it’s too soon for love, truly it is, but he’s labelled it as that and I just go with the flow, making me feel so fucking cruel to say that I love him as a reply, like a slipped out lie. But what do I know? As he said…Run away! Run Away! It is giving me the fear, all this but I guess time is what it is for a reason, it’s the only way to let it all happen.  
Today I left him at 7:30am, on Botany Rd after Been’s suggestion, I mean let’s face it, Fleet her new boyfriend (why thanks, you know I did try to get them together several times, finally I did succeed) isn’t a chauffer. Hmm. 
 
I ate my first McDonalds breakfast today and certainly my last. Although the Hash Browns were tasty in that old potato clippings pressed together with Clag glue kinda way, CB brought me one, because all I had left was ten cents. Slept a total of one hour, my brown jumper was covered in grass clippings, and full of Karloff vodka I had to tell Beenie that if she doesn’t get the fuck up, I was going to feed her to a Doberman. My god I am so tired. But happy.

Dodger my cat is lying on his back, and I'm scratching his belly and he looks so peaceful, oh how I wish I was him. His brother is missing outside somewhere, I'm kinda worried but kinda not. I just don't know what to do.  
You know I lost CB's phone and mine? at the same time? Been, Vee and my mother all gave me the same lecture and I sorta feel bad but not really. Just material shit, I wasn't going to spoil my night. It's really late and I have to work tomorrow...what a haze... 
I am worth him…I honestly believe that, I think. I mean…if he goes looking for the Bigger Better Deal…he won’t find it, love just doesn’t work that way.

       My hands feel dry and my hand cream is all the way downstairs. You know when I was talking about sexuality and all that, and it didn't make much sense, of course not he was still here. But now I can talk about it a lot more freely and I think that I  have to get it off my chest before I explode. I am one of those people that love pleasure and love touch and think the whole experience is a sensual discovery and an expression on how much you fucking want that other person. I am not alone in this  belief and I'm not the only one who likes sex for that reason. But godamn it; I am sick of being selfish and waaay over conscious about the whole thing. I am sick to death of thinking only about myself getting off...what about him? I mean I am  such a guy when it comes to sex, lazy and inconsiderate, like I just believe he can do it all on his own. I have turned myself off like a mental handicap on a lot of occasions just because I am afraid. .I am so tired of being afraid like some sort of paranoia filled cloud is consistently blurring my vision. 
This is hard for me, okay this whole relationship...it's two people...not one...it's so hard, so very hard. Because although its fucking great now, I know that if I let go it will be so much better. I am a realist yet an idealist and there is a part of me that says...what if he isn't the one? What if there is  someone out there that can do all this for you without you doing any work? See how that can fuck me up? I mean I hate that godamn voice, the ever present neurotic weak side of me. The ugly side. But you know I'm blowing this up so out of proportion, because it all it takes is thinking...and feeling freely. 
Do I love him? I care about him very much...but I don't know myself enough to trust someone else with my soul, it's just not ready yet, this society has just about squeezed all hope from me, it's going to take much more than saying "I love you" to blow all this apart and to find that fucking assurance in the belief that I am worth it. 
So what do I do? I called him today and he was out with JDan and well, okay. Talked to his mother and asked her to give him a message for him to meet me at 9pm tomorrow night. I am wearing his shirt right now and I miss him so much. Why am I such a fucking fuck up? Because I'm an artist? Been said that I have to stop thinking about it and enjoy it, just take that ride with no fear. I kiss him and I can feel myself crying inside because it feels so good it couldn't possibly be true, like the ever  present little masochist, can't be happy so let's be numb.

       I know that I haven't updated in a while and it's all because of the amazing times I have been having just one crazy adventure after another, really wondering about my sexuality now, it's all such a rich tapestry I can still feel CB's 3 day growth on my chin and chests, we had 45 minutes of raw sex just 5 minutes ago and now with the ever present fear of my mother's arrival he is having a shower. Can you imagine the blow out circuits in my head? All this is a fucking glow man I can't even think or walk straight, he is absolutely so addictive it's scary. What's wrong? nothing perhaps my fear that I am incapable of being a projectionist, although I feel some confidence. I know that perhaps I won't get the position but god damn it I don't know why I insist on dwelling on that like a disease. Finally got an old copy of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and I'm pretty happy with that. Don't know why I brought that up. I guess it was because the dude in the shop is a good friend and he was happy to give me the book and stuff and I was just on a tired high I didn't even bargain with him so I paid 13 dollars for it. Even so it was worth every penny. CB told me he was falling in love with me more so each day and when I look into his eyes when we are uh you know, I honestly believe it, perhaps a part of me just thinks it's because he is well uh you know and sometimes you say stuff intensely that you don't mean, but those blue eyes just look so full and sharp and beautiful. Fuck I think mum is home. My room is a mess I really should look into it. We fucked using my mother's bed spread she is going to freak out. I can't even turn on the television anymore it's like I want to stay happy and ignorant and right now I prefer it that way. Saw the ring with Been it was a special preview and I thought it was one of the most frightening  experiences I have ever went through. The film is cinematic art, it's brilliant, one day when I'm not typing with orgasmic blood pounding through my veins I will write about it. New computer is also on the way with Brian saying he will build my computer etc, etc and I just give him cash. I need to pee. 
I can hear my sister sing along to Morrison. Mum is not home and perhaps I can sneak into the shower with CB.
Life is good, isn't that just so disgusting?

Sitting here listening to Eminem and the muted sounds of Jerry Springer, I just feel so tense man, I know that CB is asleep yet I want to talk to him, wonder if he wants to see me today.  You know that we had a fight around 3 days ago, because he overheard me talking to Been about a sexual episode that we had that night which really wasn’t a problem because we were all stoned and all drunk and all just really trashed and of course we weren’t really listening to each other. So who cares right? With vodka and Bondi Gunja cursing through my veins, I tell her everything and sometimes she listens and sometimes she doesn’t, if it doesn’t really relate to her she doesn’t register it when she is stoned, and so she was and well I talked, okay, I talked and it all came out in three short sentences. He was mad, “I can’t believe you told her, why would you do that?” 
For the record, I like Eminem, he is my guilty pleasure and I hate Jerry Springer but I’m too lazy to change the TV from Fox8. Har, Purple Bitch mentioned Nick McDonnel…the writings of a child who watches too much television…still going for the Chuck feel, and the Thompson message…I should review that book as soon as I read it…If I can find it. Why did I mention it? I have read ten pages from Amazon and I wasn’t impressed. Bah, let’s get out of here. 
He then was silent and brooding the whole night until Been and Fleet left and well, damn, I had to apologise and tell him that I was inconsiderate and that I was sorry, but do you know how hard it is to sound credible when you’re scared and stoned? I didn’t want to lose him so soon, but he forgave me, with a smile and we had the best make up sex I have ever had, a one and a half hour marathon,  and then the next night we talked until 4 in the morning, just lying down talking and it was just so beautiful how emotions just trickle down in form of kisses, it was just so nice to be able to tell him how much I loved him and man, it’s just so sweet to hear him say it back.

       I can’t believe my ways of thinking sometimes, it surprises me. Been doesn’t buy gifts, yet here I am, worried about buying her one. A cigarette holder and case is what I am buying her, and I am purchasing that for her on Saturday during the day. This is what is going to happen. I have spent my whole morning worried about that and fuck, now that it’s sorted I can you know, let the air out of my lungs. I don’t understand why it would bother me, the lack of money, they lack of time, the whole concept of fucking lack, man it just drives me over in a little wave of depression. I should be used to it by now, you know substituting that particular problem for other bigger things, my security blanket of neurotic over obsession, because I know that’s what I’m doing right now. Last night I was having attacks of wether I was pregnant or not, worried about not going to the doctors, until my mother told me, this morning, that she made an appointment for me on Tuesday the 26/11/02. Phew! I didn’t have to dig up the number for the clinic and then biting my nails tell them that I take drugs, smoke and have a lot of unprotected sex. I was freaking out that I would have to explain that last part “My boyfriend just doesn’t cum inside me, he’s usually as dry as a bone, although sometimes there is a lot of pre-cum…actually I’m not to sure about that…I never ask him….uh…” 
Oh man…how stupid have I been the last couple of weeks? That’s why I am being strong and taking control of my own fucking life, right now, because although CB takes every precaution it’s just not good enough. Damn. I believe the appointment is at 11am, which is really good and important and I must not miss it. After the doctors I will be a little more calm, and not so high strung, which make me waste time picking at other problems, that really aren’t problems at all. Like buying Been a birthday present. See what I mean?

       Log Entry 09/11 (Transcribed from a cordial stained page of my Journal) 
The morning started great, I think Been’s brother opened the door and got an eyeful of my underwear (shit, was I even wearing any?), the sheet was coiled around my body, and I knew, it was he that woke me up, filling me with an absentminded Fear, because my mind was still preoccupied with that half dream where I was a forensic scientist working on a case about a certain murdered tribe. I remember picking through bones, photographing half decayed skulls and talking to hysterical mourning family members. Then my day was just flavoured with cigarettes, and reading new theories about Jack the Ripper, and of course, Duke’s travels: (  and then on the Hollywood Freeway straight into frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity, just another freak in the Freak Kingdom. ). How the writings made me feel and think in terms of spirals and paths, and I felt rich. Richer than rich as Been and I sat in the Parkview Hotel, talking about Fear and Hope and Terracotta interior design. We ordered a massive meal and smoked, making plans to escape to the beach later that night. Thoughts of CB filtered through my mind the whole morning and I felt like God was testing me. 
  Then later…
Everything that is hurtful and confusing comes bubbling down in a moment of gnashing of teeth. When you seethe and torment your God, berating and hating him in  a torrid spiteful prayer. Do I enjoy this life? This so called gift of chance? With all my disabilities and locked up emotional patronage to a system that will never accept me?  
So you want to become something better, something cleaner, something more pure and focused. OK. But, fuck. All this thinking of what you could have and what you could be, all strain from your brain to your heart like a frothing milk of self loathing. If you want to live. Stop thinking you need an audience to do so.  
 
I wrote that with Been in mind and with Kurt Cobain in mind they were filling my Saturday with "stinkin' thinkin'". Thanks Peter Townshed for that coined phrase.

       It amazes me how deeply you can feel for someone so quickly and know that sexually you can express it so well. It scares me but you know, he is just so beautiful. Out of nowhere he was kissing my neck and smiling he sang that Bono song snippet, you know the one... "Blue eyed boy meets a brown eyed girl.." it was just so very sweet. Then you know, the Queen of the Damned soundtrack that R.R had smuggled in for me, and boy was everything just that more intense when we put it in. The yearning that those songs have were just that more evident when you have someone inside you. Too much information? Okay, so don’t read on. Har, Har. 
CB thinks that the truth would hurt me but not really, I was thinking about the songs too as we were kissing and how sometimes some artist just know what to say to capture a moment. Don’t ask me for an example…let’s just say that on the CD, there was a lot of Nine Inch Nails songs. Did I mention that R.R was fired from work? Yeah he was found with 269 bucks he had swiped from the till. I haven't spoken to him and I know that I should because well I don't want to be the girl he will forever associate with his departure from that godamn hellhole, I was there trying to help him but he was locked out of the system and no matter how much I tried to log him back on and put shit through it just wasn't working, because his till was locked. Which somewhat relieved me because I just didn't want to be an accomplice. Isn’t that just so horrible of me…because I love the guy. He’s a good guy yet I knew he was going to get it in the ass and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  
I can't believe I am still here typing and feeling all fresh and knowing that I have to work 6 hours tonight and that just makes me want to cry, knowing I have to go back to the city. Goddamn it,  remembering that day, and last night. The city just causes hysteria. Is it over? It's over. I remember were the words me and R.R said to each other as he left the complex. Well my sister is cooking me food and I know that ice cream awaits, even if it's a little bit...

Well what a head fuck huh? You just can't imagine the way my head was just wanting to devour itself that day. I don't know why the chemicals in my brain don't just all get along, because the reality of it all was that we have to wait, just wait because it's less than a month and I keep forgetting what a practical man he is. It doesn't mean he doesn't care about me, it just means he wants to take care of himself and not screw his whole week up. Unlike someone, Unlike me.  Give me time to miss him…and all that jazz.  
I have spent the last two days running around Sydney being with CB and being with Been and all in the aura of exhaustion. Last night I was with him and asleep in his arms until we both woke up, had an awesome fuck and realised that I had to go because well, I just can't stay at his place. Why not? Because you see in this society we have to do things we don't want to and one of them is living with parents who just don't see how love has changed in the past thirty fucking years. Was I mad? No because it's an acceptance thing with me, I totally understand; But when you are warm and have to get up and hail a cab and then roam around Sydney with no money until 6AM till your pay goes through...Irritation just isn't a word anymore. 
I slept in one of the few rat free rooms in the staff room, from maybe 2:30 till 5:30am it was my last chance to get some sleep and my body was all twisted and I fell asleep and woke up to the sounds of the morning trains. Staring at the cracked walls, just exhausted, trying to piece together how the hell I was going to go home, paralysed with fear that the cleaning dude was going to see me and tell my location manager whom last shift we shared a joke about dummies and spitting them out...Running around my head these moronic things, like how, earlier, I had guided two tourists to Kent Street, while all the time bitching about how I had no money. I didn't want to ask them but fuck it would've been nice to have been home then and not at 7:35AM this morning. And all it would've taken was the guy giving me five bucks for my fucking trouble. I remembered I ate an apple pie from McDonalds and felt so sick but what else can you buy for 2 dollars through EFPTOS? I was just so hungry. Not having anything to eat but a subway roll 12 hours earlier. I hate asking CB for money you know? It’s just not cool. Speaking of hunger the sex thing was so resolved two nights ago, just one moment of sharing is just worth all the selfish self conscious bullshit. Time, more time.

       I feel like I’ve betrayed someone, uh CB?, while talking to Bri, I was just talking and well you know, sexual stuff…I hope that CB understands how much it kinda bothers me, but you know such pressure. Well you know, just talking about it doesn’t mean much it’s all about action and I have to be so fucking strong again and har, har it should be good. I can’t believe I can sometimes be so shy when it comes to shit like that. Argh; Do you know what I’m talking about? I somewhat can guess that you can’t because I’m being so obscure and cryptic. But I haven’t had a cigarette forever and I think that’s why I ate ice cream for breakfast. I just can’t talk about it on here, I also can’t play FreeCell properly either, can’t fucking concentrate. I know I’m supposed to be talking and recollecting about the party last Saturday night, but too many hazy memories to sift through and just now my brain cells, soaked with their own chemicals, have fully well perhaps somewhat are recovered, and don’t want to remember any of that sordid night. The night they almost collapsed.  
But yeah a lot of people showed up, including this guy who we are going to call Hornob, he will only be mentioned once, he was a sleazy young guy who let’s face it, cultivates his own dick, says “Hi” to every single goddamn sperm and wants to share that semen with every girl that he deems his for the night. A predator with an agenda, a fiend, someone who you would stay away from at a party because he has the personality originality of a lemming on vodka. Moron. So of course V makes out with him, his ex girlfriend sees this, and the look on her face is stained with such torment, and you know he didn’t even say hello to her and they are still sleeping together after they broke up? Shu-ew-dder; Do you see the drama, the tension? And of course Shag’s sees this and since I know he likes my sister, that he forms a competition, it was just fucking insane. I hated that because while they were still fighting for moments with strangers, like alcohol plus drugs plus talking shit plus kissing with your mouth wide open is going to equate love, fuck, fuck, ah well I was dancing with CB and having a great time until I had to go home. But the war inside my head was still going on, I felt like saying, how many bad teenage flicks do you have to see to know that what you are doing is emotional roulette? V fucking lost and tried to commit some sort of crazy suicide the next morning, a couple of hours later actually, it’s something that made me angry and when I tried to tell her why she got all defensive and it’s not about that, it’s about too much other things in my past. I feel so tired you know? Life isn’t easy and I have to be there for her and I think I helped her, but you know, okay. It was a cry for help and it came at a bad time when I was still high and still drunk. I had passed out only 3 hours before hand, my body was still in the “recovery” program, she called to be let into the house and when I went downstairs she storms in looking for something, I assume she is looking for the phone or a drink of water or something fucking banal, I dunno, and so I go upstairs back to my warm bed and a warm and naked CB, when she rushes past me and I see a knife. Of course I begin to yell and chase her, adrenaline pumping because I just didn’t know what I would do if I saw blood so I panicked and my body pushed on to the PREVENTION ALERT program and it fucking drained me, because all she needed was reassurance that she wasn’t a fuck up, and she had to be taken out of that tunnel of thought, I knew this and I did my best, and I love her I love her very much but I just hope to God she doesn’t do it again, it scared me, and she was Fear herself at that moment. It’s just crazy. I think I pieced it together enough, I will put up the photos if they are good on here, if I can get a scanner together, you know. For you kids who read this.

       Thanks for the luck and today I got a new Sim and it’s all cool again. Since I had lost two phones I felt lucky. I took good care of CB that night, and I knew then that it was real love, that’s just insanity. Anyways trying to type this quickly so I can hit the sack, got home, around 3:30am, I tranced out while watching some Hong Kong horror flick that looked really good but I was so trashed, Oh and then…the key…Dammit I can’t continue. Will write it down tomorrow night, right now my eyes are stiff and I need to think of other things that doesn’t revolve V lying down in the bathtub and me clenching razor blades and CB watching the whole thing…it’s all okay no but damn….Tough Love arises again…

       So we got really trashed on Friday and I was acting like such a slut…Har Har. Okay it’s Monday and I haven’t updated in two days and what a crazy fucking soul wretching two days it has been, like steps towards some sort of lunatic amusement ride. We got drunk on Tequila and the sex was awesome and I know I’m addicted, I’m addicted to this man and I don’t think about why or how anymore, he better not fucking mess me up because this is it, my last moment of analytical cynical thinking, in relation to that relationship. There it’s gone. I’m in love with the silly chit, and I am going to go through life with no fear because let’s face it when you are staring at it in the form of your sister holding a knife that you have to wrestle off her…god damn. Fear is one irrational motherfucker. Let’s see if we can make some sort of logical sense from this, Friday night was great, Saturday morning was good, bummed around this messy as a beaver in autumn house and talked went and got Been’s present and brought some really crap fish and chips. Been’s presents included, a SMACK THAT RAPTOR shirt, which she loved, we made it up for her, a black cigarette case, some cigarettes, a copy of  urlLink  Fear and Loathing…  and a cigarette holder much like the one Duke has in the flick. Anyways it was a great night, me and CB got really trashed and V (that’s my sister) got really drunk and did a couple of not so smart things but hey, that’s youth right? Anyways I’m still not so clear what the hell happened because that night I was so wasted, I had found a phone, well CB and me found it at Redfern station, late at night, around 2AM and well I kept it and now I have a phone again… since I lost not only my own phone but CB’s also…God it’s crazy.

        This was meant to be published on Saturday 16th 2002, Been’s 19th Birthday!, in the morning, around 11am) 
 
Where am I? Wrapped in a sari and about to light a cigarette with Dodger playing with my pencil basket and stereo cords, with Tori softly coming out of this hunk of shit excuse of a computer. CB is asleep in my bed and I feel so desolate once again. How do I explain it when I am supposed to be so happy? He is so tired from trying to keep up with my intensity and I thought his was just a strong but it isn't and I can feel his love and it's enough to make me smile and his touch is enough to make me feel content but it's not filling the void that's inside my soul and perhaps that's a huge fucking clue. I have to get Dodger out of here he is going to wake CB up and when he wakes up he gets curious. Argh, okay it's just that I can feel so fucking much and it's confusing me. Its just confusing the need and want right out of me and I just have to look at my life for once and accept it the way it is, for only through acceptance that you can move forward. I know we love each other but I know that right now in my life I'm in a very bad place, I feel physically inferior when he isn't around, I feel like I have the intellectual movements of a snail on heroin, I mean there is no stimulus that isn't coming from him, do you see how angry that would make me? An hour ago I was lying in his arms and singing Smashing Pumpkin songs while playing the tunes along his naked back and watching his closed eyes and his smile and it just blows me away that I have someone who cares about me and I am just sitting here. Just sitting here writing this to an audience that doesn't fucking exist. Last night was bizarre my stomach is twisting and grimacing in remembrance, fuck, fuck. Do you know what we did? My sister and her best friend, Jan, and CB, we all...Well, I'll start at the beginning. José Cuervo $50 bottle of Tequila gets smashed because the fucking strap of my bag breaks. Right on the steps of Liver...Is this a Hole? Pool station. CB says it doesn't matter but it did. I got so mad I punched a few walls, it was because the whole concept of $50 really got to me. But I apologised and he said it didn’t matter so we meet Jan in the bus stop, get home, buy another bottle, this time Conquistador, a Mexican-Made White Tequila and we played a drinking game with sex god Trey Parker, yeah you know the one “BaseketBall”, every time they said dude, we would lick sip suck.

       I just had a 94 minute conversation with Been and it’s all good. My body is falling apart because I don’t know….I don’t know why…yeah I do. Shit I smoke, drink and follow a very strange diet. Rock and fucking Roll, duh. And I know that it takes it’s toll on my body, right now I am doubling over in slight discomfort at my cervix muscles that are at present in spasms. I also do drugs, all this isn’t going to be the best for my physical well being. I am actually worried about that, just because I know that I should be. I’m going ahead and spilling all this on the blog so if you’re easily offended by gross details gloss over until I say when. 
I woke up today and me and CB were fooling around, we had to have each other so we did, we fell asleep again and when I went to wake him up by going down on him, I mean it was all cool, he woke up and it was very sexy and intense, until I realised that he tasted like blood. I stopped and told him so, he was all like, “You’re nuts, I’m not bleeding, I don’t hurt anywhere and trust me I’d know if I was”, then it hit me. My goddamn rags had arrived. NO chance of pregnancy, it was like all my birthdays had come at once. Seems like good news huh? Well it was all good, until after I watched Alice in Wonderland, then I went to have a shower because I was in slight discomfort bad period pain and all, then it just got worse, and then I started vomiting.  
This does happen from time to time with me, and yeah it was horrible, I was going to meet Been and watch a Hong Kong horror movie with her and CB, was also going to a play with him afterwards, his mate was one of the stars in it. What code name should that guy have? Hmm, he is a nice Jewish boy, very neat, addicted and well very together, just hates Success like most guys that I know, the higher you are the harder you fall, is their mantra. Etc, etc.  Pool Cannibal, yeah that’s a good one. Har, Har. Anyways damn I’m in pain, I should go to bed soon, anyways I am in the floor completely in pain, for three hours until CB gives me some very hard painkillers and I’m okay again. Now just 15 minutes ago, I had another bad experience, my muscles are so weak that I couldn’t hold my urine in and I peed my pants, but the thing is, that the pee went on for 3 seconds and that was it. What the hell is going on in my body? I hate this time of the month although I know that it’s good that I am pregnant and not with child. The doctor’s appointment that I had yesterday was inconclusive. All pregnancy tests were negative, I did a pap smear and I laughed my ass off, it was so ticklish and freaky to have a doctor do that, and had some other stuff discussed but you know, that’s all too much information. I remember when I rang CB to come pick me up from the clinic (it’s a woman’s health centre, he wasn’t allowed in) he wooped and I laughed like a maniac. It was a Kodak moment.  
People with sensitive stomachs, welcome back. I just read Bri’s blog and think that the reason why he felt disconnected was that it was too big a group to get to know everyone really well and let’s face it, the more I know Been’s friends the more I don’t like them, I only like one and she wasn’t there. Been is such a force that she needs to be experienced much more on an intimate level otherwise it just won’t work, also she was mad at me that day and CB was there and sometimes there is tension there between them. There is a lot of aspects on why it wasn’t a fantastic night, just a really good one. Also I didn’t feel like being the Host which I should’ve done but you know I was just worried about having a fucking KID. I wouldn’t think it was about Alienation, perhaps shyness and not really connecting with them because everyone was pretty much scattered. I’m in too much pain to continue…HARRY POTTER TOMORROW, yeesssssiiirrrr….

       Well this is a temporary thing until I get my uh act together and start doing some fucking html research on templates and shit. I don't know much about styles and cascading sheets, and all that jazz. But that doesn't mean I won't learn (Burp). 
Man, I feel idle and reflecting. I am slightly frightened about tomorrow, about my doctor's appointment, about everything. Fear is strange when you mix it with frustration and nervousness, well then, it's anxiety isn't it? Ah yes my love affair with fretfulness...you know I suffer big time from anxiety, it's my heredity flaw. My hand-me-down mental illness. How can I give that to my kid? I hope to God that I don’t have to think about that, I hope to the Lord that I don’t have a child. I'm going to be okay. I don't know sometimes I feel that this is such a strain on a very short relationship and yet I feel that perhaps this will strengthen it. CB is asleep and has been in the same position for 2 hours, it’s really sweet. Damn I’m lucky. 
The day today was hot, humid and really restless and restful at the same time, weird huh? Woke up and had insane sex with CB that had nothing to do with him coming inside me because he wasn’t allowed: "You're sending me to Heaven and Hell, and Heaven and Hell and Hell and Heaven...". Har, Har. Sorry, I know, too much information but I can’t help it, really I can’t; Love makes you that little bit more uninhibited. Fuck I hope I get my period soon, the only time when I want to really bleed, the more blood the better I say. Bring it on.  
I just don't have anything insightful to say today I am listening to great music, had a great night out eating Mexican with my mixed gang of friends, got drunk on Sangria and me and Been had great cigarette smoking sessions. I truly love that bitch although lately she is like a walking talking grenade. I talked about this yesterday, which for those first timers reading this post means tomorrow, confusing? I'm editing this now, I don't know if you're meant to do this but fuck it. Been is not a manipulative person she had every right to be mad at me, it's just that sometimes I can't admit when I'm wrong, it's another evil flaw in me that I have to work on...etc...etc...I feel guilty for making bad judgements and meandering plans but that's me, erratic, I've told her that I was a fucking hobo, she should understand...but argh, it's all about consideration and respect. I should know, I hate it when people cancel on me all the time, it's like fuck. I've had that experience before. Just confusing times I guess. Right now I'm edgy and don't want to go to bed...perhaps it’s because I’m full of food and nervousness and time is ticking away but I need some sleep. Talking shit, will stop now. Wish me luck.

       Okay, just to clarify I got scared because abortions are expensive and because I'm not too sure I can go through with it. Fleet took me through the whole procedure because he does clinical management and it's not what I want to be doing, it just brought back that god awful day we had to watch an anti-abortion film in school. I am so glad I got informed and that I'm doing the responsible thing and getting myself checked out. Fuck.  
I've been up to a few boredom killing things the past hour, so here they are, I have gotten back my desktop bug, more on that later, will try and see how many I can get, I used to have around 45 but now those numbers have dwindled since I am an obsessive deleter. Here is  urlLink Salt Mace.  From Newcastle, Australia. It's his new nick, I like it.  
This is a  urlLink  really cool little anagram site , my full name (given and surname only) spell out: "A Nerd Ether Nut" and CB's spells, Skelter Sun, Tenses Lurk, Enter Sulks, Ernest Sulk and Reels Stunk...how fucking bizzare. It's insanity...I am so tired...should go to bed...I am getting obsessive over Courtney Love again, I don't even like her. I have an image of her, I did, it's an old grungy one, I'll fucking post it next to a chemical poem I just invented, viva boredom...
 
 
   
       
     Try to fit a song 
	To what this feels 
	Do it like it hurts and pretend they know 
	what it's like to peel 
	Another face again and again 
	Sick Little Girl 
	you know just what to say 
	what to sing in times like these 
	and what to cry to make them pay 
	for your regrets 
	your mistakes 
	and your soul baring skills

       SO ANTI SOCIAL!!!!!!!!!! Fucking ass licking moronic breeding fucking asshole rings that are people! So you fuck, fuck, fuck-ING suck! Arrrgh!!! Die already then! Just die, Here’s a gun! End it! End it! Hate!, Hate, Hate! I feel so passive and drained, was spent making choc tops for the masses and being rude to over bearing lemmings. This is why I was so angry, I could’ve been with CB, fucking up his morning shift by getting us both drunk and laughing at the fragile sensibilities of society by going to a Harry House Party. We could’ve kissed and played Fools again with life. Bri could’ve come through by Fate and we could’ve eaten cheesecake and watched a flick after my evil shift from hell but it wasn’t meant to be, the dates were wrong and it was so disappointing, but it’s not really that big a deal…let me take a deep breath babe… 
I know all this negativity against work is wrong and it has the power to just consume me till I’m bitter and regretful, but goddamn it if I don’t blame it for all that is wrong with my life. And it’s not the work or even the occasional nice customer. It’s the moronic cheap rude customers and the CHILDREN that somewhat laughably got management. I wish now to stop talking about it. It’s just that I blame my exhaustion on their heads. Get on with it, New Year, please let me get into a second University course, another degree, let me have the strength to move out and become an artist, let me find something new. FUCK YOU HOYTS! Another deep breath babe? And I am getting a horrible cough… 
I think I’m still addicted to sick sad yearning, that yearning feeling I had for so long, I really miss having it for someone. I think it’s because most of the music I grew up with and listen to are about sad pathetic fucks. I can make up a poem about them...just using the lyrics, but I won’t because there is too many. Waaay too many. But a sample, yes? 
 Waiting for my saviour…she was a sour girl the day that she met me…I’m the one with no soul…etc, etc.  
I think I yearn for that crazy beautiful feeling that I somewhat labelled love, the romantic idealised trite fluff media spawned paranoid clinging pissy excuse for the real thing…no-one could know what it’s like to love how I love and fuck, it’s so not fluffy and misguided and needy. It’s about letting him into your body and reading his mind while he looks at you with love, it’s about him making sure you get home alright and getting happy when you surprise him at work. It’s not about him treating me like shit one moment and then telling me sweet lies the next, when am I going to learn this? I honestly think Carey fucked me up in that, he somewhat made me think that was love and that I fucked it up. But you know what? How can you fuck up something that was fucked up and sick and twisted in the first place? It’s so funny because Sexy Bread reminds me of Carey, in some sort of way, the whole aura I guess is very similar, that fake confidence and the pre-occupation with sex, it’s all there. Shit how come I didn’t notice it before? You know it’s times like this I am so fucking happy I write, now listen *chemical brain*, right now you are lonely and want a warm body and want CB next to you, right now you are in a fucking daze because Let’s Face It, you don’t understand how anyone can love you, and therefore you think that anyone who does must be a dropkick, when you know, oh you goddamn well know, that CB is a precious beautiful specimen of a man who with all his faults and all his fears and all his idiocrasis, loves you his own way and with all his heart and is still interested in everything that you do together, get it out, that misguided form of the abusive rock and roll star! (He hit Me, and it felt like a Kiss…) You know that it’s a media or a film thing, it must be! How dare you question it? How dare you listen to Carole Cole through the voice of Courtney Love? That’s just sick man! Sick!  
How can you look at his beautiful face and think he is a fool for loving you? What is your goddamn problem? He is everything you fucking want, all together, yet not quite, and he just happens to want to fuck you and posses you and have your heart, so give it to him already! Stop this wayward fear! You are going to fuck it up but letting fear dictate your chemicals. Man that felt good. 
I like to overdose on doubts like little green pills, you know I had a veiled talk with Fleet about abortions and pregnancy and I got real scared. Because in case you don’t know, I don’t like condoms, I just don’t. I am going to the doctor to talk about the pill and other forms of contraceptives because the condom won’t do. When you have two people who are into the whole concept of touch…rubber just doesn’t fit the picture you know?
Ha, I just thought of something, CB got a new phone and probably hasn’t figured out how to reply to messages yet. Tonight, in a cubicle, with all my black clothes stained with chocolate and ice-cream, which I was too sickened to clean, since I was preparing goddamn…choc-tops, I wrote to him that I fucking missed him and wished he was there to help me kill Jezebel…whom he sweetly ignores now, and who I know hates me for it. Har, Har. 
 
 I am getting slight period pains right now, thought you should know, belly all swollen and shit, so I think I’m about due which is amazing and great because an abortion is expensive, very fucking expensive. Yeah, no shit I know I’m an idiot okay? But it’s all okay because I have resolved to not having sex with him until after the 26th. When all of this is figured out. It’s going to be tough since that boy can turn me on with a word, a look, a casual touch, a smile...but I just can’t go through any more “Will I have a Child in this Forsaken World?” trauma.  
Lately not much has happened just been hanging out, the sex has been incredible, just incredible, he panicked about money once but that’s okay, I’m the same, but he has to realise that ces’t le vie, and money is just money. Capitalism is almost dead…hate to think what comes next.

       I would love to post regularly and to actually be up to date but the current service of Blogger and Blogspot is really poor, it makes me not want to upgrade just in case it's the same deal with a paid account. Saw Brotherhood of the Wolves yesterday night, a great adrenalin pumped night yesterday. Will talk about it later. Now it's breakfast and getting ready to take Bri to see the Ring before my shitty Box shift starts at 4pm.

       Blogger is chewing up everything I try to post, so I am going through friends to try and post on this thing for me and I am really thinking now, is it all worth it? Hmm. Does that line of incoherent thought matter to anyone else but me? Another note… I have been Christmas shopping and working like a beaten dog just to buy some gifts for some selected people to express how much I care about them, and is that a better choice than to actually see them in person now and then? Or is it just easier to spend money on stuff that might not be what they want? I mean how could you possibly know what they want when you are too busy working to get to know them in the first place? Is this hard for anyone else to perceive? I think I just work too damn much, I fucking hate that, Society are you listening? I fucking hate it. Also been really selfish with my time but you know that’s what happens when all of a sudden you have all these people who just want you around. Har, I mean why am I just sprouting this shit? I don’t know why it’s all a big deal, accept the fact that we live in a capitalist society, I mean what else am I supposed to do with my money? Yeah it sounds like I bought it. Alright, why do we care so much? because we’re people! Fuck. I love my friends and I know what to get most of them but I somehow am just not getting the whole meaning of why we have Christmas now, I guess it’s just a reason to materialistically express what they mean to us.  Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock. I guess deep down inside I just want to live an Alice in Wonderland life, where I give my friends gifts all the time and I have all this time for them and worlds just appear and I don’t have to work everyday and stuff…all that will possibly change in 2003. When I pick another children’s movie to fantasise my future life upon. Har Har. Sorry. What was it that CB said the other day? I don’t have time for Tragic Fashion. Okay. That was my piece. I’ll stop now because I totally agree. Human relations can go to fucking hell if I have to regress and regurgitate everything I do. Let’s just love and call it quits, and yeah I hope they love what I got them for Christmas, love receives love anyways. Right? 
Lately I have been feeling that CB really spiritually affects me and I can sense that moment in which he is facing himself in a dark recess of his mind and as he tries to make sense of the noise and howling, I can fucking hear it too and once again I am reminded how strongly I remind myself of a spiritual sponge.  I absorb everything… and the ever present moment when he feels the needles of inadequacy sink into him, I can feel it too and I don’t know if that’s normal or not. The other night he wakes me up from a nightmare I’m having and I stare into his eyes as he kisses me it’s amazing how much he absorbs it back. Lately I’ve been hanging out a lot with him and Been, now that she is left alone, because Fleeton’s gone on his cruise, she has nothing but nail biting time and her other friends just don’t know how to amuse her, just to indulge her with neurotic bullshit. Also lately I’ve been having some weird health problems and I have to see the doctor next week because you know, it’s irritating to be this young and be so troubled. Etc, Etc. This is the first time I’ve been home in 8 days. I really can’t wait to move out.

       God damn. Fuck. Very little time to write, going to see a film with my sister, I still don’t know what, racking my brain and can only come up with a few possibilities and they don’t seem so good. More like nauseating. Need to see CB before he goes home because I need to kiss him, it’s just that little bit tragic when you need to press your lips to someone else’s,. I think the “Oh dear Jesus, he tastes so sweet” feeling is what I crave the most right now. He also owes me the third instalment of Preacher and I need a fix. Yeah that's the real reason, just to make myself feel a little more dettached. 
Also, realised that the whole pregnancy thing was just a crazy scare to amuse myself.
  I mean look at my damn life, how on earth could I be fertile? Decided that I am going to give up smoking for a couple of weeks, will try to make this pack that I have last me two weeks and it should be sweet. I’m listing things again, but you know…so much has happened… 
Atempt Two: One of my managers at work, one of the fucking toddlers that crawl and scream and fill my mind with acid rain of hate, uh, found out about my blog because I opened my mouth and told him. Actually I don’t mind him, but he is in their bowl you know? I didn’t give him the address because I’m not stupid. He knows I hate Jezebel the Vader of the Cinema Complex, the evil bitch from Hell. He wants to know about the bitchiness, he said he wants to know about the underground gossip and I know why. He wants to know if there is an uprising, isn’t that hilarious? He is younger than me and you know, that slightly bothers me, that he is one of them and not a member of the underground youth. How romantic do I make it sound…Har, Har. Like its Us and Them, a goddamn Pink Floyd track. I am just so over it. 
 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets:  I am incredibly biased and so this review is going to sound like the ramblings of a 12 year old girl, but fuck, I just think that Harry Potter is a wonderful franchise and financially he is a good investment for Warner Bros. Am I sounding a little cynical? It’s just because I am fucking angry they didn’t add more of Ron’s house, more importantly than anything, the series is about characters and worlds, and you just can’t care about a plot if the characters aren’t shown to you the way you want them to be. Which is in great fucking detail, with actual good acting, (Who the fuck cast Tom Felton as Malfoy? Who is this Cockney child?)  So I’m being petty and typical, still how could would it be to see the de-gnoming scene? Made the thing 3 and a half hours long, sure why not? Okay so it’s not practical and all that but they could’ve interpreted it better. However that’s not to say that the film wasn’t magical, that I actually became 12 years old again and that …it touched me very much so. I still wanted to see Harry be not so much of a hero…he really isn’t a typical one and they try to force him one to be. But yeah it was really cool I liked it a lot. But you know, I have a feeling that the hype surrounding Harry Potter is dying out and the reason is because the 5th book is taking waaay too long to complete. Last news I got was that “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” was due out here in May 2003. Okay I have to go. More later.  
  This was supposed to be posted in the early days of December, but due to some error it couldn't be posted till now

       I had to save Shabado and I yelled at Groovy. Shadabo took too much drugs, he obviously thought he was able to handle them but you know that’s fucking arrogance for you. Pills, weed and alcohol just don’t mix in the brain of a leather bound emotional fuckwit. Anyways, I went to see if he was okay when he was slumped, a la Alec Baldwin, and he began to throw up which was somewhat of a relief because I knew he had to do it, he was just too far gone, but what was frightening was that he began to lie down, face down and in my drunken stupor I began to chant and try to lift him up, shit, you know saying only one line, “This is how Hendrix died man! This how Hendrix died!” Gargamel, one of my bosses heard me and lifted him up real good and then him and his girlfriend took over. You know it’s so damn sad, but he brought it on himself, he kept saying “I’m so full of shit” to both me and CB and we were like, “Oh brother, more tragic, tragic fashion. And this one is a fan of Billy Corgan, goody for us”. Ah well, I may sound angry about it now but that’s because it was scary, seeing someone like that, hopefully he is able to show his face around work, just to let us know he is okay at least.  
I just yelled at Groovy because she is still hung up on this guy, damn what can I call him on here…Pretty Toe, just because I’m too fucking lazy right now. She is still hung up on him and it’s just irritating. She also got catatonic on alcohol, there is no way we are going to be welcome at the Novotel after what we did to that Hotel. What did I yell at her?  
  “It’s been a whole fucking YEAR! Get over it!”

       I remember reviewing Harry on this thing a while ago, wasn’t that right? What could I possibly add to that? I was talking to TinTin the other night, I believe it was last night while we were waiting for the preview of “Catch Me if You Can” to finish and we both agreed that “Chamber of Secrets” was too long and that Harry repeated a lot of what was said to him, sometimes I thought he was playing Simon Says. Or being a parrot I don’t know.  I have to see it again to make it a proper criticism, the night I watched it, Thursday 28th of November, at 9:15pm in Cinema 10, I was too amazed and happy and well, how many 12 yr olds do you know that can be coherent? Mentally I regressed to being 12, and perhaps a movie that can do that can’t be all bad. Been made me laugh really hard, she has got a real thing for Harry, and I mean a really bad sexual thing, she wants to fuck a…how old is he now? Let’s say Daniel Radcliffe is 14 and Harry in the second book was 12, I mean that’s just fucked up. Either way you look at it. She jokes around now and then how she is going to smack his “Young, tight Quiddich playing buttocks”, hmmm, Yes. Okay. I believe the fact that he is a child somewhat eluded her. It’s illegal you crazy bitch.  
The Christmas party was on Thursday night, the 12th, which was two days ago and well it went really well for me, I was floating, really drunk and stoned and dancing to crazy Eminem songs, hugging everyone and just listening to some really crazy conversations, talking to a lot of people that I wouldn’t otherwise talk to, that was nuts. Jezebel made a fool of herself too, that was priceless let’s hope she doesn’t come to the next Christmas party, I kept avoiding her like the plague, I mean I just had to, how would I like to be fired the next time I show up for work just because I would have emotionally shattered her?  
“Danneth, we would like to let you go, the things you said to Jezebel have left her in a mental institution, totally damaged beyond repair, we believe that’s not a [Insert name of company here] policy to degrade and mentally bash another team member. Sorry and good luck”

       Anyways, I have decided that this new year I will purchase a pot of ink and print all this archives and start anew and perhaps I will shell out the couple of bucks to keep one annually. Pro Blog I mean. To jump to another topic, finally saw John Mayor and any musical credibility well critical ability that purple bitch ever possesed in my point of view, (She loves The Wall for godsake, how was I to know?) well dimished, crumbled and kicked it's way into a meaningless death. This year I also decided that I will devote more time to my online life, just an hour or two a day. Just to keep up with my writing. Xmas was good, and I'm glad I'll be working myself half to death through it. Ahhmmmm, what else? Fleet broke up with Been because he is a selfish twat, I actually thought he was a little more subtle than breaking up so fucking close to Xmas and New Year. To save a couple of bucks? Man he doesn't know her at ALL. On Feb 11th Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas will be back on the big screen...going to that for sure. WHY do I insist on writing when I'm physically up only because of a coke binge and because I can only be online at the wee hours of the morning? fuck this....will write later and more coherent...I promise. This template SUCKS ASS.....damn style sheets...damn them to hell.

       Blogger officially sucks dead dog's balls. I watched Beavis and Butthead last night, so excuse the crudity. My throat is sore. I'm so upset at myself and so tired and I feel the need to vent but how can I when I am being censored? well at least edited. I've been through a lot these couple of days, let's see ...hmm...me and CB spent a very nice Christmas, just he and I, um, I slept on him not once but twice. Let's just say Vampire D and Blue Velvet were just not enough to lure us away from sweet, sweet sleep. Mother dear brought sis a stereo and I was bitter for around 6 hours until I realised how selfish I was being because it's just a couple of pieces of paper...really that's all that money is. This Christmas seems so distant it's crazy and I don't know why I feel so alienated I still think it's the drugs. Right now I miss CB so much because he is such an addiction that I can lose myself in, I just feel so heavy with family bullshit right now. At least I got Alice in Wonderland for Xmas. Thanks V. What do I even call her on this fucking blog? Anyone know?

       I really want to move out, I think I need to move out but at the same time I am having so much fun being a girl. I think I needed a guy to feel like a girl. Ask anyone, before anyone cared about me, I could care less about me and cared the world about, well the world. That is so piscean I think I am going to vomit. But yeah, taking care of me is a lot of fun and thanks to the Cosmetic market, it's taking a lot of money. However I am going to budget so it won't be so bad...I suddedly got real tired and forgot to mention the really cool stuff that happened to me this week...later I guess.

       Realised that the last two posts made me sound really MTV and for that, I really must blame my sudden onset of self consciousness. Don't let anyone fool you, self consciousness is a disease, and if Carey ever taught me anything it was that, and really painfully, heart gougingly painfully. Ah here I am once again, dwelling on my one true fuck up... I don't know. Is it because I still blame myself when you know, and I know, it was never meant to be? Of course, it's so fucking tragicá. 
Been and Bri and my sis are downstairs watching the Exorcist, I am sitting up here holed in my room, feet slathered in Hemp butter because I refuse to be wallow in my internal pain and be watching that fucking scary shit at the same time. Plus I am on two pills of Napro and well... Well. I just can't deal with it. A bit too cryptic? Ha, if only you knew...I'm still sounding weird...sounding...happy. I think the human condition is to fuck, eat and sleep and be warm and safe while doing all three. Because I am, and all my chemicals are running smoothly, apart from the occasional hiccup here and there...well...yeah I think my creative outlet that is writing has turned cryptic and concise. My mood was blackened and tainted with sponge activity the past three nights, I was blaming and absorbing like I had a demonic finger pointing everywhere but my own head, I was just hating CB and for reasons that are not known to me because I love the guy, I was just feeling resentful because I felt very much worthless and he was doing nothing to make me feel like I wasn't. Like it was his responsibility. I really have to write more but I doubt that blog will even accept this length. Hang on.

       I think I read too much of Purple Bitch, I'm starting to SOUND like her....I can't believe what she says sometimes, it really opens my eyes to the levels of fucking stupidity in some people. NOONE is your medicine, no-one can be your shiny white saviour. No-one can save your scrawny permed ass. In fact I'm rooting for an early downfall. God damn, and here I was thinking that just maybe there was hope in the world...thank you TV for ruining more minds than crack. He's your medicine? What the hell is that? If you are listening to Lisa Loeb and identifying with her, you're a moron to not recognise the KACHING! KACHING! sounds behind every fucking cliché that near sighted bitch utters. When are people going to channel thought properly? It makes no sense! Okay so you need someone, everyone needs someone, its normal, but you cannot settle, it's just common sense and you cannot put anyone up high on a perfected pedastol, it would make them spiritually hurl and make you look worshipping, and like Ferris Bueller once said, "How can you respect someone who kisses your ass all the time?". So he makes you feel sexy, newsflash sweetheart, it's called sexual attraction and it has nothing to do with love, so before you start getting emotional remember that your pussy and your mind do not think the same, and you have to accept that. Love comes from a respect of someone as well as a deep appreciation of someone's being on a level that has nothing to do with the analytically horny. And it's both ways. One moment of hesitation and a pull back coupled with a declaration that he just wanted "intimacy"....surely....surely you have more brain matter than tits. SURELY you know it was a fuck, and you should've taken it because you need to be banged sweetie. Please do it soon with no regrets because at least you will do it with your eyes wide open and not shut with naitivity. Okay I have to go to bed, end of shitty bad mood rant.

       I am sitting here looking at things that are taking too long to do and wondering when I could possibly do that drawing for CB's mum, I guess I will have to do it Tuesday night and give it to her on Wednesday, I hope that is enough time. I just have to do a whole bunch of other stuff first, does that make me selfish? Well I'm just not in the mood to draw, I think after work my creativity is just too scattered. 4 long box office shifts in a row...I am about to go fucking mad. Making a DVD list to send Brian and then stopping at three just because I can't afford anymore right now, I recently brought Amadeus, Director's cut, and I'm very happy with it and want to watch it again and again, I remember as a child falling in love with classical opera, because of that movie and it's music. Music, that touched a part of my soul that has always believed in the sublime, I guess because I was dirt poor and because later in my life I've seen the depravites of the flesh and the harsh reality that perhaps such beauty is deeply longed to me. Right now I'm listening to Piano Sonata in C Major and I feel like I'm falling in love, it's the music that if I could express how it feels to kiss CB would sound like, just pure and orgasmic. Hmmm. Just placed a DVD order with Bri and am now reading Purple Bitch. Just can't type anymore, have to go.

       I have no idea why I wrote what I wrote last, perhaps sex is pumping new hormones into me that makes me speak in Bimbo. This week has been pleasant and safe and just well you know happy. Pleasant? Yeah Nice. I have been depressed about that because I feel like I'm not being rock enough you know? Like I'm not worth my art in happiness, like I'm supposed to be miserable and bleak. Also I've been working like a workaholic on heat, making my conversational skills go into non existance, well at least my creative ones, all creative juices stagnating and wanting some sort of release that didn't revolve around sex. You know, I've also managed to catch a strange virus and I refuse to stop smoking although I am coughing up LUNG....soon enough I will not have enough tissue to pump air into my body. New Years was good, spent a quiet one with CB which was you know...Nice. Damn that word again, I just don't know how to feel comfortable around nice and happy and FUNCTIONING. What the hell is wrong with me? I drowned White Russians and I kissed him and I can feel the rightness and passion between us, but...I'm just not used to it I guess. Jitters and my commitment phobic blues. Decided that this year I was going to fuck off everything that made me feel bad. Go away, get it away I've had it. Also to focus a little on what's good for me. Bought a whole stack of art stuff today and some DVD's, which you know are my one true love...Har Har. Oh well this is long enough...till next time.

        I went downstairs earlier and completed an ink drawing of CB’s mother, remember that I was talking about doing that for her, etc, etc? Well I did it and I feel so much better, because I know that’s what I’m supposed to be doing with my life, illustrating and painting, to compile a series of work to express all this bullshit in my life, to contribute a verse in this messed up Ode of Tragica that is Human existence. My room is a mess and it bothers me but then again I am in the process of moving, Been is really worried about the size of the room that she might get, she doesn’t want to move out if her room is going to be small and so forth but I don’t want a big room, but then again I don’t want a big room for me. But I am going to be with CB and a big room might be best. It’s all stuff that has to be talked about on Tuesday because that’s the only day we all have off. Dammit, I think I lost the number of the Real Estate lady, I had it and then it just disappeared. How annoying. Erskineville. That’s how you spell it. I love the way CB reads into my paintings and drawings, making up his own stories and stuff, it just seizes my heart and forces me to smile when I think about it. Man, Dude, Big Cohuna in the sky; why is my life suddenly seem so frayed and under attack? I know it doesn’t really matter and that I can somewhat cope, but just don’t give me so much and then take it away, with a series of horrible blows. The shock just jars me. I’m horribly impractical and scattered and I know that I have huge problems and that I’m not perfect and that somewhat I can be an opportunist…but what else have I got to choose from? This is a world where the meek get eaten alive and the ones who do everything right are the ones who are not poor. Does anyone else…I mean I was thinking that laws are made to completely put you in fear, I don’t want to be in fear. Fuck, I’m not even making much sense now. I nearly got fired last night. I’m in danger of losing a shitty job. I have to completely revaluate my life and that scares me, so many changes and perhaps they are for the better. But right now I’m just wishing I could hide in CB’s shoulder and cry but like that cliché goes: I fear never ever stopping because somewhere in my soul I feel like I’m still a child and I never want to deny her.

       So I found out that I can’t get into University, oh well. Big bother. It doesn’t really hurt me because I know that going back to school perhaps wasn’t the answer. I have had the shittiest week, the shittiest shift was last night where I practically was crucified in the mercy stakes of Jezebel Queen of the Harpies. Sorry a flashpoint just broke into my head and I have to verbally express this: How dare Smite think that I was to be her friend after what she did to me that day? What right does the higher powers of that godforsaken place have, to go on a warpath? So we failed a Company Customer Service test (again), and here I am laughing at their own unbelievable approach to that, you know what they did? They took away our free tickets, our one perk that keeps most of us there. And they tighten our necks with strings of unnecessary and harsh punishments for the littlest of things. Why don’t they just stop hiring 16 years olds who don’t give a fuck whether they have a job or not? Why do people need to have that fucking belief that they are higher and thus mightier than the masses they allocate to be beneath them? Why do they need to believe that their shit don’t stink? I am so sorry but all the answers to those questions are NO fucking right, hierarchy is just that, a word and a situation that is so outdated and so beneath our progress as a human species. It’s just a job, deal with it, life is a series of grey and more grey, there is no more black and white. If you choose to believe that there is, then welcome misery and war. And for holding onto that belief I fucking hate, fucking abhor and detest you. I really do. Thanks for slowing down evolution , you dumb fuck.

       Woke up today at 6:15am, promptly rolled over, threw the evil beeping phone across the room. Fumbling with it didn't help and willing CB to stop time didn't work either. All to be here, in lovely urine scented George St at 8:28am, sharp. By the way, don't ever eat Apricot Danish, it's Satan's favorite breakfast food, of that I am more than sure. Right now, I'm in a dingy web lounge not at home, thought I should post in here after I made an obscene tranfer of money on a public machine. Was that stupid? No you are just too fucking paranoid. Watched the Osbournes last night and for the first time realised how awful it sounds to say the word "fuck"  in every sentence. Trust me I may say it a lot on here but verbally I'm Doris Fucking Day. Or something like that. I'm having a little nervousness about moving in with CB and I know why, he is going to be there and love me and he is committed for at least 6 months (that's how long the lease is) and like the little sadistic commitment phobic that I am, every nerve in my body is screaming, Are you out of your mind!!?! Are you out of your fucking head moving in with a guy that you've been screwing for the last three months and who swears he loves you and you're like, I know I love him but that's just chemicals man!!! What!?!? Who is really talking for me? Fear or Love? And why do I feel like I'm sure but you know, commonsense and mental simulation is saying, take it slow babe, he could really hurt you. And it's that paranoia that has held me back for so long and I just want to feel pure you know? Not think of then and only now. Why the hell not? Anyways I better get out, get out of this Brit Flavoured Thai Hellhole. 8 mile came out today, maybe I'll see it.

       Well, hello Erskinville. Fuck it's 5pm and I have 3 hours to pack all my shit, when am I supposed to see Been? I don't know, you know? Fuck. Okay I just smelt my wrist and I like Chanel. So I'm a little more together. I left my wallet in the back of Perk's car and because she lives in Blacktown it's like when am I going to get *that* back? tomorrow? I'm so scattered without my wallet and it makes me feel really confused, like I'm a materialistic whore when I know that I'm not. I have so much to do and so little energy I feel like today will be the very last day that I can be at leisure. CB is here and I know he has cigarettes and I'm drunk on Kahluah so what the fuck do I know....Gawd I love the way he touches me, I recommend good sex to anyone...anytime.  In layman's english: FUCK! I'm moving out!! With Vee and Been and CB! we have a awesome room on the third floor and the girls have the second floor and the living space is polished floor and it looks so modern and beautiful. The kitties can come too so I'm more than happy...has it hit me yet? The real estate called Been today and crying with laughter she called me. Oh. Hello Erskinville. Celebrated with Kahlua and milk and I missed Jerry Springer but who the hell cares? I have a sad addiction to that show, it's like I want to see the bottom of the barrel...speaking of cliche's. Jokingly I asked Cb if he wanted to marry me and he said yes but not yet and I laughed. Like I meant it...or did I? am I turning into a lemming? Help! I won't look good in Gucci fur! Today really sucked I didn't go to work because I left my uniform at Been's place. I can't WAIT to move out, none of this shit will happen.

       It's such a nice day to be bumming around and not doing much, but alas here I am looking at Health funds and ways to make my life just a little bit more Capitalistic and horrifying. But hey, you know I don't have the idiocy to say my art is going to save me because I am one unhealthy fuck. I accept that. Let's move on. Hmm...what else. Can you notice a change in pace? It's because I've been watching a lot of Bill Hicks once again. Damn all this typing is giving me a weird sense of Deja v'u...  I have to go to work, do you realise this is depressing me? I'm also mentally challenging myself for tomorrow's Fear and Loathing Night. More on that later.  
Woke up late, got out late. Was depressed about losing my travel pass and so had to purchase another one. So I made a lot of unneccesary trips because I COULD..and right now, man, right now I truly believe in Karma. I wonder why Karma would choose to cover my job's ass? I mean it's a multi-millionare Corporation. Surely these nameless people are evil fucks. Right? I dunno...I actually thought it would pay if they paid for my Travelpass. I took 20 bucks and didn't give it back. It paid for my travelpass which I lost. I hate you Fate. You're on THEIR side. 
It's gonna rain and I have washing out. Excuse me. 
[Ten Minutes Later] 
$110 a month for Health Insurance...Are you kidding me? Well you know, I'm not exactly looking for an accident to happen. I am not that paranoid...but just in case. The only thing that worries me is can I afford everything on the meagre job that I have? I have to go to the dentist that's for damn sure. I need my tri-monthly checkups! I keep having these re-occuring dreams that my teeth are falling off, it's slightly unnerving. I have foxtel and adsl to pay for...I have rent and food and clothes not to mention my kitty cats. I am so sad to see my savings just stay at where they are not going anywhere because you know, one day I would love to go to Ireland. And Germany.  
My art is dead. 
I spent all day today looking for an ink box. Maybe I can go to the Markets soon...maybe tomorrow I'll find one. I'll bring my sketch book and sit near the gallery and watch Picasso for an hour while drinking a Frappe. Sounds good huh?

       Urgh. I never thought I would get the Internet back. But here it is and here I am, calves bitten by mosquitos, and eyes slitted from exhaustion. I shall call one of the night managers from now on: ShagDog, for she is the evil spawn of Jezebel and I fucking hate dogs. Hmm, I have been frightened for the last couple of days with my meangre memory, it's sieving away and I am terrified it's because of the drugs. Now it's a new house and I'm sharing it with Been who has the same capacity to say No to Drugs as a mosquito's capacity to NOT suck out my AB positive blood from my veins at 1AM after a mindblowing orgasm while I'm having a cigarette...mosquito's love after oral sex nicotine laden blood, it's their new thing. And because I can't say no to her, I have been back to day's off with the billy and it's just draining me, when you take something that far you expect whiplash. I don't know, all I know is that there is too much damn responsibility now and I thought I was ready for it, and now I don't know if I am. I wish II could be a lot more organised and a little more considerate. But, fuck it. I'm the most organised person in this whole damn household. How nerve chilling is that? 
SO. Anyways about the house, after 2 days of searching and leasing details and fights with Pizza Base, we decide to get this 3 storey house, yanno, a couple of bucks a week, good location. It's good, I share a bed with CB and it's all fine. Life couldn't be greater, it's irritating. He is upstairs right now and he has to work early tomorrow and I have to trek to Newtown to fucking look for my Gonzo outfit and pay everyone's rent. Not with my money of course, but I still have to go to the bank and pay it because everyone is a dirty bum who has to work. I don't have to work till 6pm, so yeah. Yehaw. Saw 8 mile last night with Bri and CB and I loved it. I loved it because it was soooo trashy and quaint. It was a kingdom for the underdog, the rules for the fool who has the last laugh, the uh, the uh...what's that phrase? I made it up in the theatre, A circle of types, Stereo Style, Yo Wazzup Niggah? Har Har. Also it helped that Eminem is a sexy god. I hated that whore's character though, it made it out that all girls are opportunistic sex kittens only good for one thing, to use them and be used by them, and I'm like, Guy's, she's a skank. Do skanks know they are skanks? I wonder...Anyways it's late and I have to do a whole bunch of shit tomorrow. So peace out, and I will be back tomorrow.

       I think blog likes to eat my posts. I was supposed to post that yesterday but you know blogger is a piece of crap. Cheap crap. Today I am so exhausted, because I refuse to go to bed early the next day. Fuck it! I say, fuck it let me be exhausted it will give me another reason to bitch. Today in the train this woman snubbed me (Why does that keep happening? I didn't even notice it, CB did and laughingly pointed it out, I think it's because I was mumbling about the slowness of peak hour while asking her to excuse me....PLEASE...) and when he told me that she had turned her nose up at me, I was all like "You think you're so fucking uppity? You live in the inner west you stupid mole" and well, that's that, she heard me and did shit all, like most of the apathetic people in our city. It's sad, I almost wanted her to tell me she was off to see someone and she really lived in Darling Bay or Double Bay or some Bay..but ah...onto other news. Yesterday, in the wee hours of the morning Been and I were reading about child murderers. One of them was  urlLink  Mary Bell   and she freaked me out to the point where in bed I thought the fan was her evil fingers trying to choke my legs, if that was possible. When I woke up I had that irritation that I can't speak of, and now I can't have sex for awhile and it's really depressing. I believe her evil ghost is trying to ruin my life. Har, Har, Yeah I know too much information. I have to enrol to vote because I changed address and I'm all like, Howard is such a Nazi like me voting him out if going to change anything people here in Australia are still narrowminded, still boring and predictable and still racist. I wanted to buy this book called the Fast Food nation, it cost 23 bucks of a small paperpack, it's insane times. I really am tired, I hate blogger.

       It's like that Janis Joplin song, the one where she screams: 
"Every day I keep trying to move forward, 
But something is driving me, oh, back, 
Honey, something’s trying to hold on to me, 
To my way of life. "
Or something like that. Shit, well onto other news. Just came back from the Mardi Gras Film Festival, part 3. Anyways I have always enjoyed the shorts film slots they have, they allocate an hour and a half to a selection of short films. Usually they are some gems in this collection, but tonight me and CB and Ekmin and Kamme were totally in pain, as Kamme said "It was my worst nightmare up on screen". I personally seriously wondered why America has so many untalented rich dykes. The films were so tacky and so bad and they were lesbian films! Come on girls! The gay shorts totally kicked your ass! Speaking of ass...today I asked a asian gay guy for a light and he snubbed me. I fucking hate that. He was the epitome of a red loose ASSHOLE. Urgh sometimes I just fucking hate the prentiousness of Oxford St. I wonder why no-one wants to talk about anything anymore, not really, and especially nothing political. No-one is informed, noone is well...really aware of what's going on. It's sad man, really sad. They are so wrapped up in their cool little wanna be hip stage that makes me want to mentally regurgitate. We are all having a Housewarming party this Saturday, everyone is going to be here in our house and it's really freaking me out. I hope nothing gets too fucked up. I'm too tranced and scattered today. I fucked CB's brains out last night and once again he went to bed before me tonight. Will try to write tomorrow, as always. I missed talking to mum today but will have some time hopefully tomorrow. Either way the pictures might come up sometime soon. Stay tuned.

       It's been such a weird ass day. It started with my trudging off to my unfulfilling job. Let's stop there and expand, it's unfulfilling and I never wanted to be where I am in my occupation. what am I? A fucking drone. The other day, I believe it was the day before Valentine's day, I was making CB's card, when on the spur of the moment I painted a Hippy Bird, you know multicoloured, crazy nutty bird and I was really proud of the way I handled the watercolours even though I had problems, like for example I fucked up that puffy part of the bird where the legs met the body, colour wise I had added too much red and it looked really bloody you know, like uh, it had it's rags or something. But still it was a great drawing, I was looking at this great bird that I had created and I thought why am I not in that profession? Why am I not being artistic? What is wrong with me that I cannot just go forth with this passion for drawing and painting that I have? What am I so fucking afraid? Why can't I make time? Why is everything so hard? Why can't I juggle everything efficiently and with much more control? What's going on with fear? What is it? Let me find it and kill it and just exorcise it from my life.

       You know everyday happens and when you are weighed down by responsibility you think, my whole life is just a series of minutes and hours and leisure is more precious than I once thought. I can’t believe the things that have made me angry this past month, one time I was going through my ‘red wave’ monthly curse, when I found out that during his weekly rounds of playing pool in our local bar, CB was felt up, his face in between the breasts of a stripper. Now, this boiled my blood until I couldn’t even look at his face anymore, I told him it didn’t matter because you know, I know my whole possessive thing, it’s no big deal. But then he whistled at a girl in a music video clip and I got up and I couldn’t even let him touch me I felt so hurt that I thought I was going to die. Today he was going to go buy cigarettes at that same bar and Been made the joke that he was going to see the New Zealand bikini championships and I freaked out. I really froze. I had to tell him tonight after our weekly grocery shopping spree that I don’t care if he watches a million pornos and has a million posters of naked girls everywhere (which he doesn’t) as long as a girl who wants to fuck him and is wearing a thong does not share the same air as him. If another girl touches him again I will seriously end it. I don’t share what’s mine and he knows that and well he’s the same although he said that he wouldn’t care if a male stripper did that to me. Ha. I’d bet he’d think differently, really differently if it happened to me. Another thing that made me angry was of course the audience for Fear and Loathing and Heal’s fucking dogmatic bullshit that she so emotionally and neurotically clung to. Oh and the soon to end the world war and Purple’s bitch attack on Bri that was so bitchy, so fucking catty and immature it made me want to grab her by the hair and scream, You deluded bitch! Why can you not see what’s going on? You see people’s dogma today has everything to do with appearances and feeling fucking superior, nothing to do with your “oneness and balanced view on life”. Heal saw my reaction the other day when she found a phone and handed it in, I won’t go into it, but she was being so dogmatic about what to do and how to do it and I was like, life isn’t black and white, many shades transpire and we are all different, thus we do things differently for different reasons. Deal with it and don’t fucking judge. And how dare you lump me in the same category as the other pieces of shit that roam aimlessly at work? Plus I was going to appraise the phone, not fucking take it. Man I hate dogma in practice, makes me angry. Anyways I have to go upstairs, CB is waiting, and man I love that bastard.

       I wonder what really happens to brain cells after awhile of Same Old, Same Old. I miss my mp3 collection, I miss listening to music. Right now, am listening to a rap mix of Miles Davis, well one of his tracks. It's insane. I can't believe how depressed I feel about not having a job, what on earth am I going to do now? Am I going to realise my dream and actually live it without being stuck in the Maybe Comfortable Factor? Why do these things happen? To make me a better person? I don't think so, I just end up stuffed full of denial, and no matter how hard I try it still sticks. This godamn denial, I wonder why it's so integral to the human psyche. Okay let's back up, so I lost my job, okay, am I ready with a portfolio to show to future employers? Am I ready in my art? Why the fuck am I so afraid? I had to clean the house today and I still haven't finished and I am MISERABLE...so godamn down because I want to do so many things but I am so godamn lazy and I need something to happen to me to make me wake the hell up. I am such a worm sometimes, it makes me sick. I think everyone sticks to what they know and refuse to budge from the Comfortable. So what's my agenda? Clean the house, fold some laundry and then what?? Put more laundry in bags to get washed and then what? Tomorrow I am going to the Art Gallery maybe seeing some art might kickstart me into doing some as well. You know I had an economic plan, I was going to save up and get Dodger vaccinated, desexed, microchipped and wormed. I did all that, I then was going to save up for an ADSL connection, and then I was going to save up for some art supplies....oil paints mostly and then I was going to save up for a kitchenette and then a scanner and a digital drawing tablet....fuck fuck...All this bullshit which no longer exists. I didn't want to run the world I just wanted to be content and not stressful. I need a cigarette.

       Man oh man, today I tried to be everything I was and I was so fucking psychic man, I thought godamn it this is going to be my last shift, this is it, a Thursday day shift on Box, 10:00am till 4:45pm. By 5:00pm I was fired. I cried sure you cry over the great injustice of it all. I was just so mad and so helpless, What can I do? I did everything and then some to get fucked in the ass, by being the considerate person I am, I practically asked them to anally rape me in consecutive seconds! This was not going to last forever, I knew this, but I really didn't expect it to end this way. Been and Flick are necking and whisperin and talking really loud in moments, they look excited and happy. I just took a toke and really feel good about it. In the only way I know how it eases the pain of being where I am right now, with no fucking anything....I have Freddy again in my shirt papoose and they were laughing about how we looked like roadkill mutant alien thing....but he is warm and I feel good and I don't want to work there anymore, I'm not sure if I want to work anymore, I feel so damn rejected man. So lost without my glorified McJob. Har Har. Cool Kat is what I am , Kool Cat...man I love being unemployed it's almost as orgasmic as having a needle pierce my throat. Lack of security really terrifies me. I feel like crying but think it's a really bad waste of time and I have so much to do, being stoned and all...

       Tomorrow I have to go to work. Right now I have a lot of stress and I am subtly freaking out. I have to talk to Pletz and try to maintain my job in a week's time. I have to pretend that management are not real people and accept that i'm not a real person to them. I am holding Freddy in a little papoose, it's really cute and for another second I was distracted from my life. Soon everyone is going to get here and I am going to wish for some hard core drugs. God is my life that boring and pointless? Oh yeah I know it's not but it feels like it is, because I am miserable. When you are happy in all aspects, the bad aspect stands out like a freshly chainsawed wound...Argh. It's late and I am stressing for work tomorrow, I am stressing because I have to put everything on the line and I feel like crying. I don't want to work there anymore, it's killing my soul. I want to work for a publishing company, doing something that is new and exciting. My mother might set me up for an interview, god I hope it works out. I need to learn new shit, I am sick of regurgitating the same godamn spiel everytime, it's why I was miserable at University, because it got that fucking mundane. God, what a world.

       It's really difficult to write but I want to share with you a few things that have happened today. I was pushed and shoved around at work, the foul mood that I was in tonight might put me out of a job....I don't know, what have I lost? really lost? Right now Been is dancing the ballet around to some random soundtrack from Pocahatas. It's crazy, CB says that I have been distant these few days and I'm like "I don't want you to know it's because of the drugs because perhaps it's not, perhaps I just need time to think, ALONE", and I said the second part of that sentence to him, and well I hope he understood. Around 3 days ago after that huge come down and all, well I had this awful dream that he was killed by a truck or something and that I couldn't deal with the fact that he was dead, yet everywhere I turned people were telling me he was gone and that dreadful horrible grieving feeling overtook my body that I was jolted awake and when I saw his sleepy face look down at me, I started to cry and grasped his face and kissed him because I felt like I totally lost him and thus lost my whole fucking reason to be here. I know that makes me sound like some sort of Mills and Boon trash whore but it's how I see it, take it or leave it. I am, all I can be, but it's something else when you can share it all with someone you know trully fucking loves you. I'm reading about the President's assassination and some email, while everyone is busy, CB upstairs taking a shower, the girls watching The Big Lewoski....while we are all so damn damn stoned. Good People. Good times.  
I might be quitting Hoyts, can you believe it? About godamn time, that company is a piece of shit. Go to indie cinemas, where they treat you like people. Right on. Smoking a cigarette and wondering if today I can get laid or not, was reading some Alien bullshit awhile back, someone posted it in the Bill Hicks newsgroup. I am glad I am back online, really I am. It all, it's costing us 19 bucks a month for a lot of internet. Cool huh? Did I say that or just think it? Was I talking? Did They hear me???? I sometimes belive in Big Brother. Damn. That's all I need, another paranoid feeling.

       Lazee. Lazy. Loused Up. I can't even begin to tell you why I think missing out on Tropfest is somewhat something that should be bothering me but it is. We were all so fucking bashed and trashed from last night's Housewarming party that you know, I had to travel to Oxford St and sit through 2 Super 8 films (well 3 if you count  urlLink  "Paradisco"  but that wasn't Super 8 that was 35 mm...what am I saying? I sound like I know what I'm talking about...) and so when I came back I really wasn't in the mood. I'm also having really bad feelings of paranoia and freaking out, like I want some time alone goddammit so I can nurse my fried braincells in peace. I am impatient with reading things online, I am impatient with people's lack of consideration to art man, I mean ART. How can you not want to see it again and again? It's beautiful and breathless, yet people would rather repeat other crap, while pretending they are not repeating themselves. Hmm. The war? Should I comment? NO. I don't think so, Loz once said (after About Schmidt mind you) that Howard was too stupid to be a Nazi and I incline to agree. Let's talk about the party, a lot of people came, our favorite guest was Loz because she is such a fucking sweetheart and I really need to talk to her and thank her. There is so much to organise and to make comfortable in this house and there is so little time because I'm lazy. Lazeee. Like for example putting her on speedial. Our phone is so fucked up, it's terminally stoned. I took so many drugs last night and for the first time in my life I got terrified of chems man, I didn't want to sniff anything, I was just like, get it away from me, I just don't know how my brain copes with the weed and constant stress, I feel like I'm in that limbo stage where I can embrace the drugs and be with them forever or say fuck you and stay with them socially and be just that. Do you see where I'm going with this? I have been really addicted before and I don't want to go there again and Chems can really, and I mean really take me to another level of desperation. I know that CB did a line of E and we all smoked dope and drunk like little fucking fishes and had a blast just talking cockshit and being lost in the world of music and thought. It's a nice ride but fuck man, sometimes I want to be on the calm ride, not to say that I want to be forever conservative, just that I don't want to be just left with nothing but verbal diarreah lodged in my brain. What's the point if you can't remember any of your scenic ride? That's how you learn shit right?

       Today was just so indulgent. Have you ever had one of those days where all you do is eat, sleep and fuck? That's all I did today...well...I managed to dry some dishes, feed the cats, go back to work and watched Jackass, uh...you know saw Shabado and all the rest of the gang. So nostalgic and angry, I don't know. I found out today like a bright spot of clarity that in true, actual fact ...Jezebel and what was that other managers' codename? Let's call her Scrunch Face because she is a sad pathetic creature with a pole shoved up her ass and zero personality, and because her hairstyle consists of a single fruitty ponytail that she ties up with her one and only scrunchie, so it fits yeah? So yeah in actual fact they hate me. 
Hate doesn't suprise me, it's negative and usual and boring, it's the fact they wielded their power to get me out of that job using the most pathetic of excuses because they hate me is what I find fascist and wrong, and of course don't forget Unjust. I feel ill....I need a cigarette...why oh why did I smoke my last one?  Tomorrow I have to talk to Pletz and see if I got my job back. I've been online for 3 hours trying to download "Pass the Bong" by Ween....do you know how irritating that is? I'm just listing again I'm sorry. On the plus side I found my sister's cigarettes. Yay!  
I think that as you all well know that my work ethic is just shot to hell, the thoughts in my mind when they focus on my job...you know. Go along the lines of...FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! NO! NO!  
But you know...I want another shot.  
I have to go to bed now but tomorrow...tomorrow is another day after all.
 
"Ooh lalalala, pass the bong...it's just on the table..." 
 Ween  "Pass the Bong"... 3 hours later.

       Well back to the mundane, mundane. These past few days I have been really concentrated and really thoughtful of the How to Escape my Life? philosophy. I have taken drugs to escape my life, my thoughts and have been really catatonic and an absolute nuisance to myself and others. I have forgotten so much of what was special to me because what? I lost a measly job? I love the money, I loved being so fucking materialistic, I got hooked but I was fucking free you know? Free? Yeah I know how laughable, how can one be free if they are chained to a job? Chained to expectations? Chained to the next marketing ploy and satin sheets on sale? How can you possibly call that freedom? As Bill once said "You are free to do as we tell you..." At least I was comfortable and well once again little Lady Fate comes down and quicks my ass for thinking that happiness was comfort. Comfort makes your primal and selfish and that was exactly the reason why I was so mad at myself, what else can I do? Perhaps try to work and make meaning of my life? Now is as good a time to start and I have been sitting down feeling sorry for myself for way too long. Sorry if this sounds so cryptic but I have so much garbled crap in my head. I hate everyone who makes me feel like shit and that includes myself. Why can't I just accept criticism without being so fucking vengeful? I fucking hated what I did, I was rude and evil to everyone because I was in a garbage mood, I was resentful that Been was too fucking lazy to give me a lift, like I expected it from her! Fuck! Sometimes I can be so dogmatic and stupid and anyways, I was taking it out on the customers and since it was Tuesday...you know what I mean? Perhaps not, I don't know, Tuesday is called Tight Ass Tuesday for a reason. And anyways I was rude to the wrong person and well, I got in trouble, which was understandable, but get this, the Nazi Poster Boy was with me on shift on Thursday and evaluated me, in the strictest of sense, he was purposedly looking for shit, the politics! the absolute politics! So I don't want to be a fucking supervisor, so I don't want to use my popularity for Evil, so I do NOT want to stick my nose up your hairy disgusting vile ass Jezebel and Crew...SO I DON'T....but I do want my job back. It was so secure and cozy...yeah I know...I can hear Lady Fate coughing and pointing to the Bigger Better Deal...but I dunno...I was having so much fun being a bum! Argh. Anyways I have something up my sleeve, Bri is helping me with his addition to my Digital Dream, Corel here I come! I hope he brings them soon...I need those CD'S...if he is reading, darling remember Photoshop 7 and Illustrator 10...also Flash? Dreamweaver? 120GB drive? Scanner? Can we make a date soon? Please?   Har, Har. I feel like a terrorist. Oh hello FBI...scanning terrorist again are we? 
Anyways more news, I read Preacher, Book 6 today, amazing read, amazing! It was just like eating black comedy, it was insane. I think it was also very beautiful when describing love and hate and all those emotions we hide because they seem too overwhelming. Society is so cold and lifeless these days, no-one gives a fuck, so it's nice to read about a bunch of people who do and say how it is. None of this...fish like....it's earthy and real. I believe that's why I like cats so much, if they truly love you, you know it. If they don't, you'll know it too. Honest, like people. Feelings are meant to be felt, and that includes all hurts and all emotional slaps in the face because we just can't hide behind arrogance. Just can't do it. So take it, and well do the same for the rest of us using the rule of compassion and truth. Surely that's not too hard to ask right? I can't type anymore blogger is an asshole. And they want me to upgrade...Har.Har. Let me type a page at least and then we'll talk.

       Today was great, I had amazing sex in the wee hours of the morning, it was just so fucking cool smoking and giggling and stuff, I felt really free you know? Then again I was really wasted and I'm wondering if once again I am pushing back parts of my life. Because all the time I seem to be, well wasted. I'm looking now at a site that might change my life is I so could wish, I'm trying to remember of a recent dirty memory that I had to push back because it felt too real, was it about my job? Was I feeling that desperation I then later really felt when I lost my job? How fucking self obsessed am I? Har, Har. So damn cold now, Summer is over and I have everyone here watching Queen of the Dammed. I realise now that I have one month to come up with a great portfolio, I will speak to my mother about getting a loan to do this thing. I want it mailed by the last weeks of March, I want them to see how good I am and if I fail I can take that folio to other design jobs. I will have to fight for this career and I will try to stay away from advertising because I know that will kill me. Sigh and double sigh...why do I feel like I'm sipping a martini and my life is slipping into this vodka soaked stage? Perhaps because I'm high. I hate the fact I miss my old job, I want to go to the gallery. Damn I'm finally grown up, Bri came over today and we ate like pigs and watched a gay romantic comedy and a gay thriller....really cool. I wish I could show you how happy and freaked out I am....

       Ha, I love this episode of the Simpsons. Let's see, the episode is called "Selma's Choice", it's the one when Selma takes the kids to Duff Gardens, to see if she can handle kids, as it turns out, she can't because American kids are about as easy to handle as an armed Nazi.. The are so many favorite quotes that I could recite from that episode...such great one liners, Har, Har. 
Man today I'm loving being unemployed, yesterday I thought I was going to slit my wrists for something to do. 
"Ergh! Back to the Loch with you, Nessie!"
Where was I? Forget my last rancous post, I was extremely depressed and feeling really prickly. So you know, I don't hate my sister, it's just that sometimes she can be so crazy. I had a good talk with her last night when I was tired and delirious. It was good, it's her 19th Birthday today. We watched the making of Twelve Monkeys because today she had to watch the film for one of her subjects. I like the way Universities are going about their teachings these days, education and discussion of the arts can be done in an entertaining way, through film, TV, magazines, whatever tickles the fancy in the world of Pop Culture. These days it's all good because a lot of the entertainment is actually clever. Well, apart from mainstream so-called-movies, I mean, we all know the state of the Film Industry, with all those greedy studios and producers, creating cookie cutter crap. For example, the other day CB took me to see the Recruit, which, well you know I'm a Pacino fan, circa 1970's anyways, and well I was just dissapointed on how they always give him the same fucking roles, and there is always some fucking monolouge he has to spiel out and it's like, what happened?? Why are you in this picture? Why are you turning into another De Niro? I mean come on! Hey, I know they don't owe me shit, I know this. But if I see another shit De Niro/Pacino film I am going to die from sheer fucking boredom... 
"Hey kids! Take a walk in the wild side!, ...and all the Races sing..!" 
I know this is going to sound crazy but you know...eech, should I even be posting this? Today I did something really disgusting, I went to go see about our garbage problem, which is a huge fucking problem because although 4 people live in this house, we are extremely lazy, you should be ashamed!, but consider our lifestyles...*cackle,cackle* it's no suprise. We missed TWO garbage runs, so imagine my suprise when yesterday I went to clean up, first by going to attacking the dishes, and noticing...that there is little crawling things on the dishrag. 
Excuse me?

       I can't believe how depressed I feel...everything feels so dark and lazy and I feel like crying. It's raining again. This house is such a pig sty and I feel like a drink but all we have is cheap Bi-Lo cola cans that Been fucking brought that SUCK ....it's like drinking that post mix that gets thrown on the floor in various fast food joints. I think I will go get some cordial and mix it with water. Okay now I'm back, I have been filling myself up with food because I don't have any cigarettes and since it's raining I couldn't be fucked going out there and stuff...I feel so sad. Why do I feel so sad? It's terrible this black feeling of defeat. Am I such an empty shell...there is too much going on and I can't handle it. I think I am coming down and down and down. Yeah that's it, just a chemical blow out. My sister is such a fucking bitch, I mean that she is such a fucking cold hearted emotionally immature leech, I can't believe it, she gets all fucking defensive when I remind her that she still owes CB $48 and I was like, chill man it's just that he needs to sort his financial stuff as well, and she gets all shitty and snipy and it's like FUCK YOU, I just gave you 10 bucks that I really need for my soul survival but you know be a fucking cunt about it. I hate it! I fucking hate it! God dammit!  
Oh well, I can feel my old habits coming up to rise. I need another drink and then it's cleaning time.

For the first time in my life I was speechless. Walking...Briskly walking, almost fucking trotting to give you an idea on how quick I was being, I was in search of the lifts in Grace Bros, Pitt St. I walk by the Jurlique cosmetic counter when this woman stops me, her name was..uh..Karen. Because she so looks like a Karen, you know those really beautiful women whose beauty comes from the fact that her face has been stretched into a smile for the past 14 years, and damn she is really nice in that irritatingly genuine way, even in her delusion that having good skin makes you a better person...Yeah. So Karen pretty much talks me into buying a facewash for 20 bucks that I do not need. Let me explain. 
I know what happened, she works by commission, she got me to fill this little thing, saying welcome to the Skin Care Range choice for the rich and famous and blah blah. I knew exactly what she was doing. But somewhere in my head I heard that grating Capitalistic voice that said.. 
Perhaps I need it.  
Perhaps she needs this. 
My skin doesn't look too healthy and I thought that perhaps trying these gooey products I could actually not sigh in the morning, for all my politics, for all my research and all my art and all my great sexual techiques, I really don't want to see a dull scratchy shiny face staring blankly at me in the morning. Why? 
Because it's my face and I don't want to look like a Scrubber. Jesus, now that I'm with someone it's nice to have those days when smooth skin meets smooth skin and thanks to my drugs, its scratchy meets itchy. (CB doesn't shave anymore, which is cool by me, he looks better..mwahhaa...superficial bitch that I am...) That's part one. Part two is that I really felt like helping her out. She was good at what she was doing, but then again I could be using my $2.50 bar of neutregena that in its own cheap half assed way actually does work if I ever got around to walking to a supermarket and stocking up..because I've ran out.. 
But what? Whats all this talk about soap and shit?? Who are you!?!? Okay the thing is that the woman caught me off guard and she was really feeling sorry for me by the end stage because I had no idea what oils and substances were, or why I needed anti-oxidants etc, etc. But I had an idea on what she was doing, she was trying so hard and it was really sweet but...how do you tell an aging beuty therapist that although all her help was well helpful, I didn't think that I needed to pay 20 bucks for a tube of Apricot shavings mixed with vegetable oil...because I felt sorry for her.  
Charity Economics, what would Capitalism be without it?

       This Post (09/03/03)
This time around, Next time around. When do you know that somehow you have to be organised, that somehow you figured it all out and that you can see the clear picture, the true meaning of your life? Is it now? Hello? Is that you Maturity? When do you know? When do you stop getting hit in the face with Life's "little cliche'd suprises"? 
I feel too tired to be rebellious, and when I say that I realise I'm too melodramatic for my own fucking good. Scratch that. Reverse. I'm too tired to actually have the energy to say to people, my god, are you not seeing this? To me, you have to be a walking talking responsibility to actually live your life through the truth ... and is that the same to you? Dumbfuck? I was outside the hospital, a hospital last night, around this time, yeah I'm pretty sure it was yesterday, me and Been were about to toke our last stash when Been decides to check on V, but you know my sister hasn't been feeling very well these last couple of weeks. She believes all life is a dirty black wash, that she is nothing but a vaccummed soul full of razor sharp hurt, that no-one can understand just how much pain she feels, that it's just so damn hard to wake up in the morning and be 
dissapointed, in just how much life fucking sucks.  
Boo fucking Hoo. 
Yeah, perhaps that was too harsh. As she said "Are you going to treat me like shit then?" No. I replied...but then again I have a real good reason to be extremely non tolerant of stuff like that. It was my childhood, my adolecent years, and now if you push me into that fucking emotional Jaws scenario, I am terrified I am going to sink into it so quick and so deep that people will let me die due to sympathy. "Holy Hell, just let her DIE already!" 
Personally I know that I have more reason to be miserable than she does, if the "Society" manual is anything to go by, I'm unemployed, with a worthless University Degree, and a drug habit. But in the real human emotion world, where there is no manual, she perhaps is worse of than me, thank god for Strenght and balanced Serotonin. It took me a couple of years to realise just how much I don't give a fuck what people believe about me. Anyways, to the point. I was standing there, freezing because I was in my pyjama mode, watching Been freak out when she realised that we had an overdose on our hands, and well yadda yadda, gotta leave some shit out because apparently it's "private". But the thing is...Why do you not live your beliefs? If life is so hard why don't you change it? Yeah so it's hard, it's hard to watch your life be controlled, but that's when you have to get the hell out and change it. That's the evil side to being able to see through the black paint that the media pushes at us on a millisecond basis, it's up to you to change it. Now, perhaps she doesn't see it, perhaps she has swallowed the lie, perhaps she has an idea on how everything is supposed to work. Is it working? I didn't think so.

       Today I woke up to the sounds that I was cheating on CB in his dreams. Is he that insecure? Or just that sick? I would never do it; it's not in my fiber. I went downstairs and turned the television on to find that they are completely fucking up Baghdad, does anyone understand how wrong this is? I mean they are just beating them up for the FUN of it, for the FUN of it all, and to get their greedy mitts on their oil. It just makes me so mad how these CNN and these BBC and the Australian networks think I'm that damn stupid that I don't see straight through it. There is nothing that can justify the complete humiliation and destruction these people are facing right now. They want to kill Saddam Hussein, and they think that murder is justifiable. Morons. What makes them better? Tell me? What makes them better people? If Hussein is killing Iraqis, if that makes him a demon, then America is the motherfucking biggest demon of them all. How easily people forget, and then they say, well we had to kill Iraqis back in 1991 to get Hussein out of power, well guess what? He is still there and the whole Gulf War was a waste of fucking time. Bring it on in 2003! Try and kill him this time, and then try to tell us that it won’t be a money making scheme, that it won’t hide the fact that they want to condition the whole damn world to their fucking standards, and that they will stop at nothing to be the center of control. It shows us, the people, that our governing collective are a bunch of uneducated power hungry alienated backwards fucking asshole demons from hell.   Bush, Howard, Blair, the triad of the West are dictators, plain and simple, except they are worse, they hide under the pretence that it's a democracy, fuck that. People are just so godamn sick of their propaganda bullshit. Everyone around here is so bummed and so tense. We all had to go to vote for the State elections; I was just disgusted by the blatant half-truths. I was wondering when did normal people go to sleep? When did we become sedated that made the people in power believe that they could pretty much do what the fuck they wanted? Well I never went to sleep and I ignored them and I knew they couldn't believe it. Well believe it, and I'm sorry if I'm being rude but fuck you ok? I already know who I'm voting for and it won't be anyone who is jamming a leaflet in my face.  
There is going to be a party here tonight, Bri is coming and bringing a small crew, a lot of people are going to be bringing, small armies. We are joining together to escape the guilt of what we are letting happen, well maybe I'm being a little dramatic there, I really don't think even we have a choice. It's going to be pretty funny but my room is going to stay locked because fuck, I just don't want a repeat of what happened last month. Ash everywhere, spilt bong water, chems just getting blown in the wind. I know I'm going to get trashed and I don't care, anything to get my mind of this terrible, awful Iraq beating. I'm glad they are calling it an Invasion because that's just what it is, a complete sadly backwards Invasion. I’m sorry to all the patriots out there, but I fucking hate America.  
Bri just called and it seems that he is only going to be bringing himself...Let's hope everyone just gets here with lots of drugs so I can forget, completely. But yeah I voted and made sure everyone around me knew that I hated Howard. A complete and utter fool. YOU ARE A FOOL, and if one single Australian civilian or troop has to die for your so-called cause, I will spit at you if I ever have the misfortune to cross your path. God dammit, I hate this! And I have tried to refrain from writing because I am so damn mad! You know I was watching CNN and this buffoon actually said, as he is pointing on a map of Iraq; “For those who understand the geography of this war, this is Iraq” and I’m like, well for one thing, don’t insult my intelligence ok? Firstly, it’s the only country on the map coloured BRIGHT ORANGE, secondly it says IRAQ on it, in big black letters, and thirdly there is a circle near the center of it, which says BAGHDAD. Motherfuckers! Fuck you! FUCK YOU! I need to get laid while being completely off my tits. Yehaw.

       I have to apologise for the scatter that was the last post, but you know, the things that come out when you are under stress and your sanity just feels a little too slippery to hold on to...for much longer. Today was an accident prone day, where Fate was like a cigarette that you forget to ash. Did you like that bit of English simile? I'm practising for my Bell Jar epic. Well like the Bell Jar, which I'm sure not many people really understood, my writing is a little self centered, but at least it's just my writing and not my whole fucking life. Chewing gum makes me feel just that little more venomous, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.  
These days the internet is totally fucking me up, I am beginning to think that an ADSL line is going to be the way to go, but how can I do all that if I don't have a job? I think I may need to get out a loan, how the hell did all this happen? Trap me, you almighty whore dollar? I am so much better than this.  
Did I tell you I saw the Hours? Well Meryl Streep proved that she could play herself. Cool. Nicole Kidman and some plastic nose also featured, it was so emphasized that I felt like it was a double dig at Feminism, sorry but I really felt that (You know that age old sexist thing, that a smart woman has to be ugly since a beautiful woman doesn't have the capacity to think, or even worse, doesn't want or need to). Is there a war on women? Well look at the casualities, so many of them are starving to death, others are overworked with the stress of being ideal, some become career women that end up caked and hardened into a lonely existance that is depicted for a half an hour, once a week on Sex and the City, others grab a man at their peak mid twenties for a fear of being alone, and end up with fat boobed up nagging geeks. I don't know I'm grabbing stereotypes from the media. I've been told that I am being anti-social so I have to go and be all talkative and stuff.

       That post was posted just then because Blogg is a total whore and I hate it. I can't believe Bri wouldn't let me househunt with him, I have NOTHING TO DO now that I'm jobless. Oh sigh...and I just wanted to hang with him, am I such a desperado that a gay chic guy doesn't want to be seen with me? Do I cramp people's styles? Why am I writing this? Big Gay Dan came and visited today, brought his two flatmates, one who I think I gave a bad impression on when I first met her at BG Dan's housewarming party. Hmm, and then Kaima came with his cousin (one of many, he is Fijian and they seem to move in colonies) so we pretty much had a full house. I went to watch the Hours, and it nearly killed me. It was so damn sad. 
I have been reading this website for the past 30 minutes, I'm not really in the mood for writing, but I will write this. I am not going to link it because it's a piece of shit, the people who write for it are walking talking turds who need to be infested with the ebola virus for even thinking that ANY publicity is good publicity, these fucking ass munching assholes. We need a war? To lower your fucking OIL and PETROL? you stupid, stupid narrowminded self obsessed American DICKWAD. You are the black worms in Satan's Semen and I wish you a very painful death! If I could prevent all those innocent people in Baghdad from dying in the most horrific way for crimes they did not commit, and all I could do was to nominate one life as a sacrifice, it would be Bush and then I'll go to the U.S.A and shoot you in the motherfucking face!
I'm sorry but that had to be said, if you want to know the site  urlLink email me . 
 
Me: “Dad, I listen to alternative rock”
 
Him: “It all sounds the same, what the hell is it an alternative to?” 
I agree with one of the turds. The Alternative Fashion scene makes so much money for the drones to have the delusion that they are different and alternative. It sucks but you know, that's why we have some choice to wear what *we* want to leave the sheep fuss and look over their shoulders.

       Crawling things...mmm...on closer inspection I can see they are maggotS, on an even closer inspection I can see that they are coming from the window sill, on a closer...yeah even closer inspection I realised...no-one took out the trash and so these little maggots are trying to escape drowning (it's been raining really heavily here in erko) and yeah they are in my godamn kitchen. I swear to you I wanted to vomit/scream/vomit/scream and managed a weak gasp and gag. I freaked out and began to rock back and forth slowly until V got home (we ignored it and smoked cigarettes and talked about my possible new employment at an Independent cinema close by, I handed them my resume today) and we waited until Been got home. Followed closely by CB. 
Homer: Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment. 
Marge: Are you going to eat it? 
Homer: [pause] Yes. 
CB and his McDonald whoring ways, buying 3 cheeseburgers, I tried kissing him when I crawled into bed at 4am this morning and was all like...eww. Stale burger breath, no way buddy! fuuuuuuckk yer.. 
So anyways we all inspected the mess and decided that going on a Mortein run would be the best bet, so Been and V went to ANY convenience store, I just yelled ANY, and threw them 10 bucks (my sister didn't use it,previously, she ran to work instead of catching the very late cab) they went and when they came back I sprayed the bin area and the windows of our kitchen outside and inside and I sprayed the bin area and the wall, and the outside grate, their foul, foul nesting area. I sprayed like a crazy woman...it was disgusting. Today I went to go and put the rubbish out and whatnot and found a whole swarm of the fucking little things. THAT'S IT, I screamed and stuffed what I could into the ONLY bin the council gives us, which they deem is big enough *rolls eyes till they cannot roll no more* and it's such a tiny bullshit excuse of a bin, and then I had to wash the whole backyard courtyard with disinfectant and I had to drown and kill so many fucking bugs and maggots and larvae... 
Selma: Surly, can't you do something. 
Surly: Ey, Surly only looks out for one guy -- Surly. 
Selma: Hm, sorry, Surly. 
Surly: [pause] Shut up! 
No-one helped me but that was understandable, I mean I wouldn't help me either but you know, I earned brownie points and I don't have to do the dishes for ages, or so I thought until I remembered I am unemployed. Sorry I'm typing this late night and I just ate some overcooked pasta that I made...I can't handle that shit. What the hell have I done? Why do I have an unhealthy connection to this Computer? I have to talk to CB about that. I feel like crying, and who the hell makes awesome sauce and then mixes it together with shitty chalky disintegrating pasta? FUCK! I don’t know I just don’t see the point anymore, I feel like I am just way, way, way too emotional to make pasta.

       I can't believe it's 8pm. I'm looking again and I still can't believe it. Time, when you have nothing to do just drags, until your life just resembles a skid mark. Ladies...when you're bleedin', and all you want is a cigarette but can't be fucked going over and getting your papers and filters, and tobacco...what do you do? Hmm, I'm looking at my beautiful Sims CD, I remember the days when I used to play that game everyday, usually when I woke up, play a few hours while eating breakfast then go out just after Jerry Springer. It was a great time, but I got fat from sitting down too much and drinking shitloads of Milo. Actually I think I was severely depressed and had issues about daylight and regular human contact. Those were bitter times. I think I will throw the CD Case across the room now. No. I won't be doing that. I really hate not having a job, not having money, I went all fucking crazy coming down from MCK/MCX double fucking dose, I lost my fucking wallet at the same time which I can fucking assure you, was not fun. Gee, was calling the cops fun? Was freaking out, looking through garbage fun? The party was massive, there was around 100 plus people here in this house, 95% of which I did not know, and I stupidly leave my wallet near the computer. It's now gone, and I remember picking that wallet out with CB, I had dragged him all around Newtown and then finally dragged him all over George St, starting from Charlie's and finding one at a tobacconists. Damn it, it was such a beautiful leather wallet. CB has called me twice from work now, I told him I was bleeding and thus to LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE...but then I was all happy and shit that he called...and it's not his fault I'm emotionally erratic. I don't know...boyfriends can be weird. Okay, more than likely, I'm weird. I was coming down real hard last night, and I had a fight with Been, because of it. When two people are coming down and one doesn't KNOW that they are coming down, it's just fucking tense. I told her that it was just because we were chemically burnt out and she agreed. I mean it was just so stupid. But fucking hell, I don't want any more parties at my house, I don't want them AT ALL, they are simply just too much hassle. Damn my cigarette went out and the cat food is on fire. Be right back. 
I found a McDonald's apple pie in the fridge, it's been there for three days, when CB and Been were stoned and came back with all this free shit, I think it was around 4AM, five apple pies they scored for free, and they were dumped in the fridge. I feel ill now, I actually only eat the pies or the occasional stoned cheeseburger, and I have to be stoned to enjoy that shit. Stoned and sedated with Cat Stevens...You know, Been and Vicksen (her new nick...now...) said that they were going to call professional cleaners, but when? I mean come on, when? I know it's not going to happen and everyone will have to wait until I get well to clean this house up. Last Monday I had to go to an Interview for Coles Myers, for Liquorland, and it was a disaster. There were people from everywhere applying for the job and a lot of them; well they just looked like they were desperate to get it. One was an engineer, mid 40's who was made redundant earlier this year. Another one was applying for a manager position, he was from a cellar in Perth, another one was this kid named Adam who just graduated from High School and used to work at Aporto's in Newtown...and around 4 Asians who just needed a legal job. Fuck, it was just insanity, and then thankfully, I got a call from the manager at the Dendy, that independent cinema I applied to two weeks ago, and she wants to see me tomorrow at 3:30pm. Shit. I'm bleeding and have no anecdotes. Fuck, fuck, fuck. But cinema work, is what I know and love, just for it’s flexibility, and well it’s closer to home and it might give me more room and space AND money to be able to paint. Wish me luck. Please.

       Those posts were written a million years ago, when I was trapped in material hell. And blogger was not co-operating. Now I just don't give a fuck, in essence of it all I had a catharsis. Enough said about that. Today I went to that place that I loathe, while standing in line, CB and I met with a psycho from Redfern, he was really interesting, could you call him an example of human waste? No, I don't think so. More like a result from a system like Centerlink, which sees Australian society as GOOD vs BAD, as POTENTIAL vs MENTALLY ILL. Bah. Tomorrow night I am going to attend a socialist meeting, just because I pretty much have nothing else to do. Har, Har Freddy came to say hello and he fell off the computer desk. What a crazy cat. Yeah so I feel down that I didn't get the job at the Dendy, I feel pretty much like shit, and am fraustrated beyond belief. On the other hand I can feel Fate, that sadistic bitch, telling me that it's not the way to go, that I have much more talent than to waste my time selling tickets, but you know...it still feels like I fucking failed. I'm in no mood to write ... more later.

       You know when there are four people living in one massive house together, you get to find the weirdest shit, when I remarked that I was thirsty my sister handed me a bottle of cool water, from the fridge, which was really nice of her. But the bottle tasted like pork chop. Hmm? I can't drink pork chop flavoured water, it's just not cool. Pig just isn't associated with water, unless you live in a Hog farm, but I live in Erko, so it's like...no...anyways the mystery will remain unsolved. Our fridge is clean too, so unless someone drank from the bottle after having pork chops (I don't remember buying two sets of chops, and the one we have is safely in the freezer) Ah...why am I fucking going on about it? Anyways, I had a talk with Vicksen a couple of days ago, she was feeling down and wishing to return to mother dear and suburban safety. It was pretty traumatic for me to scream some sense into her. But fun, the house had visitors too, some people had dropped by and had to listen to me screaming "Get off your fucking cross! Life is tough! Deal with it! Take a step forward and stop running backwards!" I know, it's too much news, my life is a series of bad clichés, metaphors, similes and puns. Hmm. I, uh went to two movies and one play in the last couple of days, went to see Daredevil because CB is an action freak and although he is an intelligent guy, he is still a guy obsessed with comics, so you know I drag him to films and he drags me to movies, so it's all good and it's all free. Been and her boyfriend also came, yeah I know...fun, fun. Been and I at least made fun of the movie, but when boys get together...they freak me out with their testosterone, it was worse when we all went to see Final Destination 2 (Guess who picked that one? Actually I did...I think it was the craving for mental junk food). Then, well that was Wednesday, and on Thursday I went to see the premier of Punch Drunk Love, which left me feeling like I've been punched by a drunk, I thought it was sweet, just eccentric. Too eccentric for most people to understand, but it was a character study in banality and repressed emotions, so I understood it. Most observers do, ahem, ahem. Whoa. Paranoia is back! Bah, whatever. 
I was really affected by that film, do go see it if you feel like feeling some pain. Or go see Daredevil and get your intelligence questioned. It's the same as turning on the TV when the news is on. Yep. –imagine another deep sigh- It's too late ok? Just listen... 
Now onto the play, this was a scream, fucking loved every minute of it. First production of a new theater company calling themselves  urlLink  Comediocre , the play was titled "Othello: Clown of Venice", as the title suggests it was Shakespeare's Othello, but instead of a Jealous Moor, they had a Deadpan Clown. The acting was brilliant, the set was okay but then again, this is low budget, and for it’s budget, the set was really cool. The play itself was hilarious and beautifully written and I actually couldn't guess the ending, which was really good because it meant it was written with intelligence rather than with prosaic conventions. It's playing at the Newtown Theater so if anyone lives downtown, do go see it. What else? I know I have left something out. Financially I'm in the shit house, I can't believe that I have to go to my mother's house and weep to her to lend me my rent money, but then again I don't know what else I can do. I was thinking about painting a portrait of Margarita our evil Real Estate agent and giving that to her for rent money, but I somehow don't think she will understand the concept of barter.

       I have no idea what people expect from me, like I give a toss either way. Trying my hand at writing, pouring thoughts, people just assume that because I'm a girl I'm supposed to not give a fuck about anything except my hair. Har. Sorry I have no idea where that came from. A couple of days ago I went and downloaded a Bill Hicks mp3, and just listened to it for the millionth time; it's a 64MB mp3. Revelations, uncut, from his London show, which I have on DVD, it kinda fills in the gaps to the otherwise badly edited DVD, which was censored.... - imagine a deep felt sigh - Why do DVD companies do that? Just don't get it. 
Man, I have bad indigestion; I have been reading so much about this war, and every single article that I read I can see my vision turn red, the level of anger is rising till I can feel it being expressed when I punch CB’s punching bag, or when I fuck him. Har, Har. I really can’t believe that I am getting more and more angry, I mean I’m at my fucking angriest here. I just can’t fathom it, I have always known that politically we as a race are so shifty, so selfish and moronic…but this? This blatant disregard for my intelligence? And not just mine, but also every single person that I know has their intelligence questioned, every fucking day! And patriotically blind posts from really lost people in the only newsgroup I have really belonged to...really itch my already angry red chip on my shoulder. Where are all these cliché’s coming from? Well what do you expect when I spend 95% of my time reading newspapers? Damn. My creativity! Anyways, the angrier I get, the more evil I become, and somehow that makes me get indigestion. But fuck, politics are a well-known demon in my pack of obsessions, and everyone knows how tightly I hold onto those. Hang on; I have to roll myself another cigarette. Marlboro tobacco pouch holds 30 grams of shag for 12 bucks and lasts me two weeks. Pretty sweet, ha, cigarette companies and me...the battle rages on.  
This sucks, I went to go get my filters ($1.50 for 150 filters, $1.20 for 100 papers) and I drop my packed cigarette...spilling tobacco on the wood floor....FUCK...Thank you God for reminding me just how much you hate the fact that I smoke Marlboro, but I want to stress to you dude, that it's 12 bucks and it lasts me 14 days. Okay. You want me smoke XTC cigarettes? Then stop making them 15 bucks for 10. I know, why don't I just stop smoking? Har, Har. Right.

       I just had to tell Oj she was pretty so she could give me a Malboro Light. I had a laugh at that. I would do anything for a cigarette apart from breaking personally effecting laws. You know what I mean, like anything that would hurt someone, I don't do. It's a good code to life it makes it a lot easier. It sucks not having an ashtray though, you have to make one out of paper and stand the cigarette up on the table. There was a time when everything I said made sense. I swear it.  
Upstairs CB is lying on the bed, writing. Or he is outside writing. He is extremely mad at me. Because I denied him and apparently made him feel like it's his fault. I loathe that word, fault. It was not a fault, it was something that just fucking happened, so godamn over it. I need to get my shit together and start painting again, and I will buy blue and yellow paint tomorrow. And black too. Get over it!  
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets DVD came out today and I bet it sold like the very devil of Capitalism and Free Enterprise. It's playing on our DVD player because Vicksen is an avid and participating comsumer. I watched some, and it seems to be repeating itself. How many times can that girl watch some little dude wearing glasses  being freaked out all the time? Don't get it. I loved the books, and will continue to be an avid member of the written text. Okay I am going to go upstairs or outside and look for CB.... grrrrrrrrr.

       So I haven't written in awhile. Shoot me. I prefer to live my life than to write about it, too many seconds tick away like unmarked moments in a sandstorm. Yeah I'm pretty fucking high right now. CB is really mad at me, it's because of a certain sexual thing, so I won't bore you with it. But I will bitch about it in a roundabout manner. How dare he expect me to perform after he says something like that? I mean I am sorry but I am not made of stone, I am extremely sensitive and I do not take passive criticism very well. You know that way they tell you that they don't like something and act like they don't really care. If they really didn't give a fuck they would keep doing it! To not spoil the moment with verbal diarreah! So it's the truth, but it hurt me! I like being in my romantic denial. Oh whatever. Chess, and more Chess, it's all I do now, smoke and play chess and watch the War. Or read about the War. Actually I am reading way too much and the theories are consolidating themselves in my head and that makes me angry because that means we live in a world that is so corrupt and so blatanly controlled that it makes me red with overboiled blood. Remember the good old days of your youth where you used to watch Saturday morning cartoons and usually they were comic series. Like for example, Batman or Inspector Gadget, or even Thundercats. You saw these hereos use rightfully moral and ethical means of getting rid of the bad guy, like going after the Bad guy and not kill 1,525 innocent people along the way. Ah, and you saw the bad guy retreat and the people he was victimizing SAFE. UNHURT. FREE. You see, you remember shit like that and it's pretty hard to realise the reality of this so called war. You see happy Iraqui's and I bet you, they are the middle class. Or the uneducated who believe they won't be put in slave labour jobs or you know be FORGOTTEN. It's their land, their oil and they are just babies to the American Thug. Okay I better shut up now, I believe I have been over dosing on  urlLink  Flash, click here to see what I mean.  
 
What other news. ONION! ONION!!!!! I believe only one person who reads this will understand...this is to them: I am so sorry, but I do not approve of a vegetable like organism who looks like the plant from Little Shop of Horrors. What the hell? it cooks itself? Har. Har.  
I know you will enjoy that because you're such a bitch =0)

       I have lost a precious thing and gained nothing back but sand stormed chemicals that were was once reminiscent of what I was once was...
Aw fuck you know, it's all about freewill, when it all boils down to it, and I mean where the pressure cooker is there shining your face and making sure everyone can see you pathetic imperfections...it's all about freewill. I sit here in pain and without sleep, clutching a copy of Micheal Moore's "Stupid White Men" and I... I don't know, the States just sound so wrong, so damningly mean and it just sounds like I've heard it all before...Satan Vs God anyone?  
On my 24th Birthday I woke up around 7:30am, knowing full well it was the middle of the night, but ah you know, I laid there, remembering how I had to haul garbage bags onto the street at 4:30am that morning, because no-one else would... Fuck it. So I went back to sleep and woke up at 8:30AM, awaking to the niggling irritating notion that I had to be at EviLINK as soon as it opened, which means that at 8:30AM I should've been at that roller door. But on my fuckign Birthday? To quote Fresh, "You must'be trippin". 
Then you know came the kisses from CB and then I trudged upstairs to wake Been up, who duck faced told me to make her a cup of tea and she'll be down in a second...she was my ride, so yeah okay ONE cup of tea I went downstairs with everyone, picking forms up, smoking cigarettes, realised that my sister was left out but you know that's life I don't think she noticed it, so it's all cool. 
Either way..... I have to go.... 
Good News later

       I have to go, so this is really quick. Last night I spent 4 hours in the Royal Prince Albert Hospital because CB was ill, do you know how evil that experience was? I don't fucking recommend it, at the end of it all we got a cab back home and the cabbie was really cool, he said he was a Labor cabbie and I felt like kissing him on the cheek because he only charged us $6.70. Being in a hospital for so long made me realise how lucky I am to be healthy, well yeah okay, healthier than most, and I don't want to be so fucked up that I have to be in the emergency room for 4 hours. I had to use one of their bathrooms, one of the patient's bathroom and it was so ill...man it was so damn gross....shit splattered everywhere, vomit coating the rim...MAN O MAN...please please more fucking funding for these hospitals! come on!  
I really have to go and change into my jeans, and run to Erko station CB is waiting for me. Okay, enough, we are going to see X men 2...yeah I know, another movie but it's free! CB got full time at his job so yay! I still don't have a job Boo. But's it's all cool. Did everyone see the speech Bush gave??? Argh, Cough. Spit. More later. Can you believe he could lie through his teeth like that? Amazing...

       I have one more job to apply for today, then I can go to bed. Slowly drinking this glass of water...watching more flash animations. Wanting to do something about my health but lack all motivation. Haven't touched drugs in a couple of days and I feel like crap. This house is falling apart, I haven't seen my sister in three days, and watching her sit down whilst watching TV is not really seeing her. I am hating how I am fighting with CB about our relationship, like we have a problem, like I WANT there to be a problem. 
I am scaring myself when I find myself getting accustomed to this lifestyle, I am scaring myself with my addictions. I want to be able to take walks again for the sheer fun of it. I want my vision to not have radioactivity in it. Why does Photoshop have more features in it? Why do I feel like a retard when I don't understand masks? When I know all I have to do is just apply some brain storm and practise and I'll get it. I have stopped playing chess after my dismal defeat with Been, who tore my ass because I was too tired to come up with a solid defence. I cracked up though when Been said "Do you ever get furry teeth?" I love talking to people who read. I am addicted to ice blocks, because frankly in winter they are fun to eat. Well Autumn then. It's raining. I hate that. Oh yeah I watched "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" today in Broadway. Hmm. Yeah okay, okay I'm sorry, but will it make it better if I tell you I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through it? I was so damn bored. Kate Hudson may be hot but geez man, PLEASE will someone shoot her agent? TripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripeTripe You dissapoint me beautiful lady. Been loved it but then again one of her favorite movies of all time is Titanic. Okay enough. I am ending this entry now....go on guys have a (insert favorite addiction here) and bless yourself for having a life I envy, do it for me because I love my avid readers. Holy fuck! Where did THAT come from???! Me and my mother had an hour conversation the other day and I only yelled once. Cool. Mother's Day soon, be sure to support your mother financially at least once in your lifetime. She knows you love her, but if you forget...she might forget too. I'm sorry, I was just channelling Hallmark...more apologies...

       I've realised that I have updated this soo rarely, it's starting to look like Blogger.com. Was that a snide remark? From me? Never! So yeah, I got an email from Ecce, saying he wants me to re-do his website, but that he wants to be able to update it pretty simply. I have Dreamweaver now, so it should be no problem, apparently he has a Glebe market stall, fuck that makes me slightly edgy, anxious perhaps is the better word. I have to haul ass to Glebe, hopefully Been isn't working so I can bum a ride with her. I haven't been sleeping every second day, today my stomach exploded because I have injected it with too much Mocha Kenya coffee, trust me the name means shit, it's still instant coffee, and to all the coffee lovers out there, THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT...My Lavaaza ground coffee was abducted by Bri's car. The other day I stayed up and visited this  urlLink  website   and I was really impressed, cold and shaking from chain smoking, I began to develop a real love for flash animations, because you see although I have always loved their simplicity, it was just too impressive for me not to love and I mean really fucking love at that moment. I urge you all, all that feel this political fiasco was an INSULT to your intelligence, to have a look at this site. Speaking of stuff, I surprised myself the other day when I said I hated stupid people, but then I realised that it's because people took it the wrong way. I don't hate people who are simple (trust me, I don't care, I have great conversations about cheese and TV with simple people) or who just don't have an interest in anything that required analytical thought (...*twitch...*) I just hate people who arrogantly shove their stupid narrowminded parroted verbal diarreah my way, I mean... I only have ONE gut and I am sick to death of busting it when I so easily make ridicule of your fucked up sorry hick ass.

       You are an ENTP! 
As an ENTP, you are Extraverted, Intuative, Thinking, and Perceiving. 
This makes your primary focus on Extraverted Intuition with Introverted Thinking. 
"Clever" is the word that perhaps describes ENTPs best. The professor who juggles half a dozen ideas for research papers and grant proposals in his mind while giving a highly entertaining lecture on an abstruse subject is a classic example of the type. So is the stand-up comedian whose lampoons are not only funny, but incisively accurate.
Maybe me and Bill would've had a jolly good time...  Har. Har.

(CHECK POINT)  
Yeah that's me. You see, you can look into the present with the future in mind, you can look into the future with the present in mind, you can learn certain things through concepts and associations, like how to build a webpage in several programs, HTML as a concept, and how do you learn to play chess with a strategy? You  associate  the pieces with moves, and then with attacks, and then with defences. Yet with things like learning state capitals or the formula for sugar, you actually learn FACTS and facts are easy, my favorite mental junk food is How to Be a Millionare, not because of it's sheer capitalism, or because I believe Eddie Maguire is a national treasure, but the questions! they are great questions, and facts are well...fun and they stick. Absolute truth, through facts, you have to love them. And being observant, I can never learn from mimicking, but if someone fucks up I sure as hell not going to repeat their mistake. I like comfortable tasks, like my daily card games, spending time in bed playing with CB, drinking strawberry lemonade and that first cigarette after a meal. I like my friends but love the fact that they are volatile people. Love to shock and probe, so perhaps I don't make it too comfortable...but there is comfort in my own predictability of raising a "Where the fuck did that come from you crazy bitch? I swear sometimes I am deeply afraid of the mechanisms of your mind!" So you know. Uh...What? Don't get it.

(CHECK POINT)  
I like hanging out with just a bunch of close friends, I mean close friends are important, sure enough I love meeting new people, but you can't forget who is in your close field, yanno, love to get to know the true individual, I know all about the façades people give out in parties and I can see straight through them, but you know you play that game, with one eyebrow raised but you play it and then move to next person hoping they are not a social retard. Yeah I prefer coffee shops and small corners to talk, quiet streets to pick people's brain in, but at the same time I like getting wasted and riding the long getting to know you train. Big Picture? How can I not look at the big picture? I like trees, but they are fucking trees, I like to know everything about a subject, but get bored when I get the gist, most of it is repetition anyways, but always go back to it 2 - 3 weeks later, systems, concepts, viewpoints, discussions, bring them to me. Love to listen, PRIVATE???? ME????? Nothing of me is private apart from 4 really fucked up experiences in my life and they are too surpressed for me to even think about expressing them verbally. Ask me any question and I will answer it truthfully in a story. I like stories. Can I keep a secret? Yeah I can because frankly most people's secrets are confessions and they just needed that one time to proclaim it, to speak it outloud and that's that. Who the fuck needs to hear it? I don't, but they needed someone, so yeah okay, I'll listen and be Priest for a Day, but I don't repeat it. Unless it's sex talk, then CB doesn't stand a chance agaisnt me, my girlfriends and margaritas. I never host parties...too much work. I like close friends, like new people, not private, like the big picture, but I respect deep dark confessions. Focused on stuff, yeah I am, you should see my paper trails and the amount of knowledge that I have accumulated in this doped out brain. But I guess I'm more erratic than focused, most of the time, so you know, fuck, I don't know, I don't really think that I fit either of them. SCAM...oooooh it's a scam...

       Okay nothing much is lost except my will to sleep. That is not such a bad thing you know...really it's not. Had a pretty uneventful day, the thing is peeps, is that my life, my fucking days are all based on education and wasting time, I got a wad of software today and have been learning it, while spending 3 hours...3 fucking hours! my mind was a mess after my flatmates finally hauled themselves and an exhausted me out of that godamn pit of a  urlLink site  and fuck how is that news worthy? Did I tell you I had sex with CB again? Shock fuck! Y'all know that I'm a nymphomaniac, some de novo news please! Of course, of course I don't want to go on and on, about how my life has no meaning because I don't have a menial job. Har. Dispodent and angry? Not again Dee! Shit man, do you have a button on your set that isn't switched to Indifferent? Of course I do, rabid and angry oh my. Speaking of angry...Where are the WMD's Bush? I really want to see the big bad weapons you said Iraq had. I haven't forgotten you piece of shit, and I really believe that 56% of the USA haven't either, so the chances of your redneck ass getting into office again is ha...zero to none. If you get elected again I will personally lose all faith in evolution, and will proceed to hate Americans for not being strong enough to get off their asses and start a revolution agaisnt Mr Bush and his White Supremacy...oops...I meant Government. Ah...alas....that is going to be not a good look for me. So back onto the self obsessed wagon because I have to share this with you guys... to the persistence of Bri I took a personality test (see wasting time!) and you know what, I hated it, my personality isn't that concrete, and so therefore I'm going to invite you to analyse the fucking thing with me. Together.  
The site is called  urlLink  BLOGiniality!   Let's just look at the url for starters...love productions? can you manufacture love? Hallmark have a hefty stock price that says yepyepyepyep, but you know if you have to buy yourself into love, you're a real delusional fuck who will end up being bitter and resentful when you realise that you have put all your energy into making your wallet fatter that you forgot to educate yourself daily (translation - You turned really boring, really fast so she fucked your best friend instead) you forgot to develop that really vital part of yourself which is personality (being a fucking sleazy jerk isn't a personality it's a disease, for translation see previously) and therefore couldn't hold a relationship because you only attracted really vacuous people. I swear Oprah Winfrey is in deep shit when she meets her maker, she has made nation upon nations of stupid women who lie down, open their mouths and accept TRIPE and brand that tripe LOVE. Love is  fearless  and passionate and it's about living your life, and about sharing courageous visions and simple comforts, it's not about dinners, flowers, dresses, jewellery, critical dependancy and blind faith, fuck man I am 24 years old and I know that...godamn it's about emotional evolution! Anyways remember how I spent 3 hours with Beenie and the others on that stupid site? Me and Jesus got 99%... man that's just insane, just thought I'll throw that bit of trivia. Anyways onto the next part, Bloginality offers 4 questions, and the answers are in pairs, meaning that I only have two options. Why do I suddendly have Michael Jackson singing "It's black, it's white" in my head? So...this is the first part:  
prefers large groups of people, with a wide variety of friends  
Act first, and then think.  
distracted easily, without as much concentration on a single task  
very talkative and outgoing.  
as a host/hostess, always the center of the party. 
This option fits me best   (CHECK POINT)  
I like having a wide variety of friends but I never have time for them, I love parties but usually hang out with everyone at one stage in a one on one basis. I hate the telephone and prefer to speak to a lot of people at the same time. Okay. I act first because thinking in action is a blur, it's too quick and my actions are gut actions and you know I'm too easy going to get really upset over a bad gamble. I'm being distracted right now. Hmm cigarette...Oh look I found  urlLink  Ecce's site!  , I always talk but love to be silent and focused when I'm interested in something, and then I ask a million questions. I'm never the center of a big party, too many unknown people make me nervous because I offend so many because so many don't get it, but if there is a willing audience I'll talk...if it's a known audience I'll bring the laughs, but sometimes I am too interested in people to talk so I'll listen, I don't outright judge people they have to irritate me first. I'm never the center, this personality thing is a sham.

       I want a glass of Coke. I just ate some Crunchy Nut Cornflakes and I swear I can taste that addictive stuff they put in it...it tastes very sweet and it reminds me of cocaine, straight cut, but then again I have never tasted it, just sniffed it, and you can't really smell sweet..or maybe you can...but I don't remember really because I was really stoned. It could've been Icing Sugar...urgh come on! They couldn't possibly do that...it's illegal! isn't it?  Kids eat that shit man, no good...Okay let's start. Woke up at 8:20am, I actually was startled out of bed, I felt a touch to my face and I jumped when I opened my eyes and see CB's blue-lack-of-sleep-and-sex eyes staring back at me.  
D: "What the fuck?! Dude, really....no..." I begin to turn over, so he grabs me by my shoulders and turns me back. 
CB: "Hey...(kiss, kiss) do I get a kiss goodbye?" 
D: "I can't look at you right now, sleep thief, shameless demon from the cruel Day, robbing me of my precious sleep, I hat-love you, no.."  I panic because I realise he could get hurt by that, so I stammer. Look at me, being logical and compassionate in the middle of the night! 
CB sighs 
"I love you, but fuck off? please? pleeeeease let me sleep!"  I say grabbing his shirt front. 
CB: "I'll see you when I get back, I didn't mean to wake you up" he says kissing my left breast. Damn why didn't I put clothes on?
"Go away!!! Please man, I'm not going downstairs to get the condoms and you're not touching me unless you're trapped in latex! FUCK OFF!" I yell as he began to get into bed with me. Let's say he's mad at me right now and chose to be at work for 15 hours. He started at 9AM and won't finish till Midnight. Great. No, really.  I have no cigarettes! 
CB leaves in a huff around 8:26AM, and I fall back to slumber, around 11:23AM, my phone rings and I wake up frantically thinking it's the Lotto (I was still smashed) and as I breathlessly answer "Hello?" I hear CB again "Hey honey, I forgot to put my share of the rent..." 
Yeah it's so fucking nice to live with your boyfriend. Spent most of the day drinking Coke, watching Pretty Woman and doing a watercolour of Hunter S Thompson. Did some Tarot Readings with Jacks, CB and Been last night, today it was with StephLaire. Oh and I didn't go and see Spiro! Because yeah I needed to recover. Tomorrow, ah, tomorrow is another day.

       I have to try and find Annie, this chick I used to talk to a lot, ages ago. We seemed to have lost touch but you know, fuck. Wonder if that crazy drug addicted emotionally insecure bitch is still alive. I would like to know. What does Abstinence mean? I will have to look that up, give me a minute: ab·sti·nence  ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (bst-nns)
n. The act or practice of refraining from indulging an appetite, as for food. Oh okay. I'm pretty fucked eh, because I knew what that word meant but I was distracted by the fact that the left shift key doesn't work, and I'm taking tests at  urlLink  the spark   which is a pretty cool site, but it's totally fucking with my mind man. It said I am 50% slut, 81% Un-Intelligent, and I'm currently doing the sex one, so fuck if I know what the answer is. I'm pretty bored, but pretty high, I have to see Spiro! tomorrow and well, aparently in the World according to Been, he heard about my dismal stint at Hoyts and wants to offer me work. Which isn't bad. Tomorrow is the start of my work week so yeah should be cool, going up to him and having a chat, shall jot him down as my looking for work contact for Miss-a-Link. I miss him sometimes, he would give me excellent discounts on books and we would talk about shit forever. Miss those good old times when I had MONEY. Anyways, I just did the sex test and I am 42% sexy. Which sucks, because I always thought I was a hornbag nympho. And it says I have a 73% chance of cheating on CB, which sounds about right,

       Sitting here listening to "I hear him before I go to sleep..." I have discovered a quietness that accompinies Kate Bush. It's true you know, no-one really knows your mind, while slouching here, smoking cigarettes in my green long sleeves turtleneck, bright yellow sportscar jumpsuit pants and my pale sunny yellow cotton dressing gown, bare feet, and all. I remember quite clearly what is was like to not be in love and the ache, that pleasurable ache of wanting it, of feeling if you didn't have that closeness you would die, I remember it all too well. That's why I'm pretty happy being in this awesome relationship. It's not just the sex, hmm, like you know, CB, you're just a life support system for a cock! I mean I truly love him. I was talking to my sibling about sex, I've been talking about it for awhile with her, it somewhat made me realise that she is 19, fuck and I remember her when she was 3 years old, and to think that someone is having sex with her somewhat makes me ill. Is that so chauvanistic? but I'm a girl! and when I was 19, I had 2 one night stands! and I did a symphaty fuck! I mean it's just my crazy brain, things are going in there that you could not possibly concieve. In other news, I have to go watch Bridget.

       Back up! 6 days and I haven't written? well I've been busy, I got ADSL, got a small and insignificant job that is going to go bust this Friday unless Spiro! goes weak on me, then it's his freakish endevour and not mine, I watched the AnimeMatrix (not too shabby, reminded me a lot of Liquid Television..remember the good old days of free MTV?  Bless ABC, no really, bleeeess iittt *shakes fist*) and ate Subway for the first time in 4 months. I don't know, it's been crazy times trying to get everything together and perhaps I'm not close, I don't know. I have to see the doctor soon, actually I have to get on Medicare soon, then see the doctor. I can't believe some fucker stole my wallet back on 22/3....that was just too evil...speaking of Evil, I have had just too much contact with Jezebel...I feel so fucking ill when I say the name...evil weed of human flesh...destroyer of hope, breeder of pestilence. I hate her. Damn, too busy for hate these days it's not funny so another quick recap, with Drain breaking up, Mas getting all womanising freakingly so...and my constant obsession to play Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush to Been thanks to Jacks, I have to hound Brian tomorrow...actually I have to call him. Okay I'm back. Fine. I can't do this now! I have 6 pages of quotes to type up, 5 more jobs to look for....farking hell. GO AWAY vultures! Soon ....images.

       I am so full of Thai, urgh, last night, or two nights ago, I went out and drank quite a bit. I saw the old goons and felt nice, and I realised that me, Been and CB, when together have absolutly nothing to talk about because we just hang out too much, we live in the same house. I guess we do talk and talk but it's nothing insanily exciting. What was the last discussion? Oh yeah "What is the Matrix" but on levels like, what is real and who isn't. That's what happens when you have been exposed to LSD. Anyways I made a decision that I will not spend a whole day in the house, and I will not spend too much time with my crazy Henderson family, just because I am sensing that I am becoming 2 dimensional and man, that is just not going to happen. Speaking of 2D I spoke to my mother tonight and she wants to bring my aunt to this house...I'll say it again...this house. Yeah, like that's going to happen. Too much time in this house doing nothing, just blasing through, too much time with not enough motivation cursing through these veins, what is I want to actually do? I know I don't want to grow up, I don't want to have a 9 to 5 job, I want to be able to work shift work, and I want to be self employed. Will Fate, thou cursed wench of the world grant me 50,000 dollars a year in Lotto? Yeah I have to get out of the house more. Had dinner tonight with Bri and CB and it was nice, they dared me to eat a small seedy red hot chilli, and my reward if I lived to enjoy it? a free dinner. So yeah I ate that motherfucking thing and it cleared out every cavity I thought I possessed. If I am not cured from the cold then I have that evil flu strain that has been modified to combat Codral. Tomorrow is Saturday and I have no work because I forgot to call Spiro! and I am sick still...I mean I still have that horrendous flu, I would've only worked for Dendy and that's because they pay good money and it's fun work. I would be nothing but the shelving girl for Spiro!, yeah that's worth my Saturdays.  
I have been overdosing on Celebrity Death Match and it feels good to watch the Hanson Brothers maul themselves to death. Real Good. Wurz finally gave up Onion Man and that was something that I was secretly proud of, well secretly? well I was proud of her, because noone deserves to have an Onion man leech themselves on them, emotionally, financially nor physically. Root vegetables and a girl who lives for French Connection just shouldn't mix. 
 
 Listening to:   "...you can see the humans trying to run, oh look there's a red machine, I'll go outside if you look the other way, wouldn't believe the things they do" "Down in the Park" - Foo Fighters, but that one is a cover of a Gary uh..Nueman? song I'll shut up now.

       Was rehab worth it? Was being sick worth it? That's the big thing, for those who have given up and thought, why read someone else's thoughts if they don't fucking update? Har, Har I agree with you. These past days I thought I shouldn't feel guilty for not writing, even though I do, because it's something to do and it feels great to feel incriminated. These days are just coloured with shitting over something, fucking anything, just give me those bad feelings so I can once again curl up with them. Look, I know all that is just fucking bullshit, this is the same mentality that has stopped anything from growing in anyone, I have felt these confusions for so long that they are automatic reflexes, because at some stage I gave up my free will to chance. I know, how terribly Winona. 
But I gave up grass, and started chain smoking again and have a chest cold that would make any 30 plus smoker proud, considering I'm only 24. But fuck I was down, and out and I thought, thank God I'm not chained to that drug anymore, I'm just chained to myself. So I sat down and watched Girl, Interrupted for the millionth time with CB for the first time, and for the first time I realised that the most hateful thing you can do to yourself is believe that all this internal war is real. It isn't real, it doesn't exist, it's a stream of addictive poison stemming from your childish belief that you deserve something from the world. I don't deserve shit. I have to uh go arm wrestling in the night with the demons and piss on the side of this great big bee hive...just not do it with a Southern Accent. Argh.  
Okay now that we have all that crap out of the way onto the fun. I'm smoking tonight, yep, there is a dead little girl in my staircase and I am home alone and I am going to smoke within 15 minutes of Been coming back from the Cross. To make her feel good and to make me forgetful. I have to go and tell Miss-ALink that I was ill, and that I couldn't go to the Doctor's because I don't have a medicare card. Think they'll buy it? I hope so. We shall see. I worked at the Dendy for 9 hours last Saturday and it was just absolutly so insane, these people are a different breed. I must observe them more. I guess I should be looking for other work, I'll promise that when I stop, I'll write again. 100% guilt free.

       The other day on Sunday I was drunk, and drunk on 10 Jack Daniels and Coke. You know I am on some sort of health kick I said to myself as I drowned Jack number 7, wasn't I supposed to not have soft drink? Well post mix is hardly soft drink...I met a lot of travellers that day, and that day was when I saw Been as a sad girl, for the first time. I don't know, I want her to be happy but sometimes bad things have to happen to good people for them to grow. Look at me, I'm practically compost. But yeah I am going to go on a diet, toning around in some muscle defining blah blah. I think I've been watching too much infomercials. You know the other night I was watching some red haired Evangelist barking about how it was real hard to stop smoking because she enjoyed it. I actually identified with that, it's hard to quit smoking when you love it, and i love it. It makes boredom seem acceptable.  
Quotes of the day: 
 (while tasting new brands of coffee grounds using a perculator) 
D: "This tastes like dirt" 
Brian: "Well it says organic on the cover, and dirt is technically organic" 
D:"It also says 'Java' on it, another name for dirt? uh.. it tastes like shit" 
Brian: (defeatedly looking into the cup) "Yeah" 
D: "You don't think it's too bitter?" 
Brian: "no...no...(pause) I don't know what other word to describe it... it's..it's... meaty...." 
Funny how caffeine makes you think everything is funny, we were so high on it, really, really high. Ended up going to bed around 6am, wondering why little red men were picking at my covers, and why my mobile phone was winking at me. Cool, another legal high...!

       motherfunkin'... I have been changed! You know, when we get a new printer cartridge I am going to have to print all my entries, just because well... you never know when this thing is going to be possessed by another trend and wipe everything out. *paranoia, paranoia* Hm...I don't like this...I'm starting to feel a little freaked out, change when it comes to my art just is not... well...it doesn't sit right in my intuitive gut. I know computers, they are quensiquentially (spelling? can someone  urlLink  email me   the correct spelling? it's driving me nuts) evil and will do anything to eradicate human thought and feeling. Am I going too far? Maybe...but I know sometimes you must think it too... 
Doing housework and coming on here and just do my usual shit just doesn't feel good anymore. I guess wanting to get the hell out of my head doesn't work anymore. You know I was right, times they are a changin', gee I'm taking credit for Bob Har, Har. I cleaned my room today and saw possibility to keep it that way, my mother is coming over on Saturday and I know that she is going to approve and for the first time that doesn't scare me anymore, I didn't fucking do it for her, I did it because I was sick of living in squalor. Stains on the carpet, the possibility of not getting the bond back, hunger, fear for Freddy's life, you know I saw that sick bastard of a cat run through the main street here tonight, he ran climbed a tree and then raced back...like he was trying to tempt fate or something, fucking retarded cat! if I didn’t love him so much I would have strangled him and made some ear muffs...grrr. I have a movie I should watch tonight so I shouldn't say much more...creatively I'm a loser, just don't have the time, but I have the time to go on here...I guess there are times when creativity just spurts in a person...I've already made up my mind, life is not to be taken like a dead fish...it's not that scary. Right? there is no such thing as fear? Can you sense how scattered I am? Are you listening? Har, Har. Okay, Okay...I guess I'm still a little sad about the other day, me and Been had a huge fight, a massive fight, a horrendous fight, old memories came out, with claws, doors were locked and slammed, cigarettes were consumed (not overly so...) and it was such a purging experience. Fuck... the past that you have lived makes such an impression on your present...and your future...even if you don't want it to. Today I looked at a photo frame my mother gave me, it said in silver writing (the picture was my formal University Graduation photos) and it said, "success it measured not in actual achievements, but in the depth of the effort". I sometime wish I had the strength and fearlessness of Bill Hicks or even my mum, who strongly got us out of poverty. Sometimes this world is so fucked up I don't know wether I want to be a part of it, but why just float through it? It seems like such a waste. Maybe God put me here for a reason...surely...  
  Quote of the Day   
"My bikini is leopard print which i think is appropriate since I am in vetenary science" - Lauren (winner) from the show "Who wants to be a Playboy Playmate?"  
Is it a coinsidence that she has the same name as  urlLink  purple bitch?   I think not...actually perhaps so... at least this Lauren had breasts, big fat juicy breasts...poor p-bitch...actually...big breasts aren’t that big a deal...they are just fun during sex...so it's not like she is ever going to use them anyways. Kudos!

       Woke, to the sound of two phones going off at once, I managed to pick up my mobile phone only to have a woman ask for me...ask me how to pronouce my name...and then my battery dies. I hear the phone downstairs and she almost picks up on the sentence...I tell her how to pronounce my name, half asleep and wanting to die...but I tell her. Man I just had a shot of vodka...I can't write right now...later...

       To those who have no fucking idea what I was saying in the first sentence of my last post...it's okay, it's not your fault, you are not stupid, it's that I didn't explain to you that a small child has taken over my brain. Okay, uh...Been has been censored in her blog! apparently saying naughty words is a no no for blogger.com, which I think is slightly amusing, you see blog has a new format, it has some funky ftp thing going on and the set up looks really snazzy, but it fucking censors words like shit, cunt, fuck and pee brain. Blog has been an up and down service, the only ones that have stuck around are the masochists wannabe poets, and now they are censoring them? It's just not kudos, you know? Hmm Been just gave me some hot porridge with sugar and honey...it's a diabetes worst nightmare but to me...it's so sweet...so addictive...it's like eating regurgitaed bird seed that's been regurgitated by a strange mystical bird... mmm yummo... 
Nothing much happened, I went to bed late last night, remember those 5 cigarettes a day rule? today it broke, we has a huge domestic here in the house and well it was *really fucked up* but it all got sorted and my lungs had to be sacrificed, I must've smoked at least 14 cigs, freaking out and breaking into cold sweats, it was just so intense, we had Scorpio...Pisces and a very confused bull watching all these freaky words being throw around. I don't feel bad, because well....it's a small relapse but tomorrow is a different day, damn...if not smoking is making me use cliches again..[shakes fist] I went to work as well...had an alright day except the shoes I was wearing felt like hot needles impaling my feet...it's just so tiring to do the same things over and over and to watch all those happy faces going to see films that I am not going to see until like...EVER because my body clock is so fucking out of whack...Sexy Bread was there and he kept bumming cigarettes of me...and because he is so damn charming what can you do? I hate people like that...you just can't say no. Grr. Man.. what's going on? Just gotta do something instead of watching the sunlight slip through the cracks of this selfish over indulgent home of mine...as Bob sang... "Times they are changin' ..." let them change dear god, I can't just watch my life just bleed right out of me, I am having Courtney Love dreams again and she fucking freaks me out.

       Hey I'm still in old blog mode, I don't know wether to be happy about that or sad....hmm I choose happy. Today was like any other day except that today is my second day of only having 5 cigarettes....you see I am going to cut down and quit. Finally after ten years of puffing on those glorious, sweet cigarettes I have decided that the cons really outweigh the pros, like they have done so since the beginning of my smoking career. I don't know, I guess denial is a powerful thing. Grrhhrhrhrgrrr, the packet is staring at me, it keeps whispering into my ear, "Go on, Dee! You scalliwag, you worked hard today, so you've already smoked your 5 cigs, what's another one? Everyone has gone out, CB is upstairs playing Zelda, you know you want it...no-one has to know..." I don't know why my packet of Drum has an English accent...but the thing is...I have to quit I have to say no, and stop the headache that is at this moment cursing through my head, if I do not quit now I am going to regret it...but can one cigarette really make all the difference? Shit can you see how this addiction has chained me? but uh..can it really make a difference? Okay let's not think about smoking, let's talk about Been's new blog, you all know Been, crazy character that she is, she now has an online journal. Yeah, we all knew it was going to happen eventually. I think she fell in love with the internet after me and her visited  urlLink  this site  , one night and fell about in fits of hysterics over the webmasters comments and choice of "weird and disturbing" examples, she was so impressed that she emailed him and he emailed right back, who wouldn't? she's hysterical. If you want to read her blog go  urlLink  here . But let me warn you, me and her are quitting smoking together, so that's all we are going to be talking about for the next 4 weeks or so...har har. Hmm I know CB is upstairs playing Zelda...I'm gonna go check...

       Hey apparently you can buy a Blogger jumper, I never noticed that before because it's an ad...and you all know how I feel about ads... (insert squinty glary look right here) Commercialism on free speech --- 
 
(days later) 
I wrote that just before Vix's and Roach Boy came stumbling through the door...you can't even begin to imagine the absolute horror and loathing I feel for that man...I want him to dissapear, to melt, to vamoose, he is a parasite, such a moron...a complete fuckwit. I would spit but I value my saliva much more than that piece of shit. I HATE HIM. And for fear of being ALONE at age 19, she is FUCKING him, I am so sorry but I just can't get it, I don't get it, I just think... a junkie...a liar...a manipulator....and she loves him? What the fuck does she know about love? If that is the lenght of her experience she doesn't know shit. That's 5 years more of dellusion and repressive denial talking, I went through it, but thank god that my self respect won out. I have always said, no man is going to put me down, NO MAN, and I will embrace solitude and celibacy, I have my art, my cats and a vibrator, that's all you need if you can't find anyone that will love you as much as you love yourself. Perhaps, that's why women go with fucking losers, they have no self love whatsoever, it's nuts, if you don't accept and know yourself and bury your individuality in a pile of EMOTIONAL DIARRHOEA then...well...it all makes sense doesn't it? 
  Quote of the Day   
"GOD DOES NOT EXIST ONLY FLESH...no wait...wait...it's ..THERE IS NO GOOD, THERE IS NO EVIL, THERE IS ONLY FLEEEEssshhh" - CB remembering his favorite monster quote, for interest...mine is "In time.." from the Exorcist....creepy.... 
Well what has happened? I got uh...a bit stoned the other day, like I can remember days anymore, when we went to see "Bruce Almighty", why do I keep on going to see Jim Carrey films? It's just not...fuck man I was so dissapointed...I blame Jennifer Aniston, she's a whore. She is too common to have AB+ blood, (inside movie joke...she makes a point about her blood type in the movie...it's a sign of her 'goodness', she gives blood because she has a rare blood type, so what does that mean? I'm satan because I don't? I have the same blood type but I hate sharing it...it's MINE...) anyways, the movie was trite, pure tripe, I thought I was in marketing hell....I hate the plantation we have become....damn you people....evolve! 
Thanks lil Dragon for "Consequential" it was driving me insane...  
Oh also we went to Lucky's tonight and it was good food except that I think I have a bomb in my stomach....damn those Italians and their super rich food! I am just...so..weak...

       Just saw a blog called girl, interrupted and that made me feel nauseous for a bit. I don't get it, in her quest for individuality Susana Keysen would tear that chick's eyes out for stealing her bit. You know...you can't do shit like that to crazy people. Har, man where do I come up with them?? *cringe, cringe* Right now, we (meaning me and Been) just finished watching SUPERBIT "Labyrinth" on DVD, I think the term "juicy" doesn't even come close to describing the image and sound quality on that baby, I really love that movie, all of a sudden I am 9 years old again and it somewhat troubles me...nah it's all good. Last night was pretty eventful, saw Mika and American S for the first time, in like 6 months it seems, and we all had a couple of drinks but I was drunk for only one hour. And that's after 10 bourbons, it was pretty bad, everyone was trashed and I was like.. eh... played pool and me and CB lost, but not easily! and I got some fruit chews to eat on the way home in the cab. I for the life of me don't understand how to get the last 2 chests in Dragon Roost Island in Zelda: The Windwalker on Gamecube, I am TEARING my hair out, I don't fucking get it, and I want to go onto the next level!!! This is my second video game that I have played faithfully, the first one was Diddy Kong, on Super Nintendo. I like Nintendo, I don't get all the buzz from Playstation of X Box, just don't really get the whole thing...but if anyone wants to give me one for free..har..har. Not addicted, I swear. Bad mouthed the Jaquis in front Glassy Ji and he might be coming over to watch "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas..." I mentioned I have that criterion edition right? Thanks Bri, if you were straight I would fuck you out of gratitude... ha.. maybe not. I have a boyfriend with a big dick...so yeah..maybe not. Har, Har. So yeah realised that the pub scene is so over for me...blah blah people talking shit, I don't know what to say half the time because I am such an INTENSE political person, and when I haven't been reading I'm just like... "so...nice....shirt...".  And you have to be *nice* all the time, "Hi, how are you? You look great! want a drink? yeah...yeah.... I'm working very casually right now...yeah...you should come see our house....yeah....we have two cats, I call them the Gatekeepers, if you are not escorted, and walk straight into the house, they claw your face off...yeah...hey...why are you drinking screwdrivers? That's an instant hole in your stomach, drink straight vodka, or vodka mixed with a little lime, they give you a straight clear pissed feeling, you mix juice and it's all over, you'll confuse your gut...what? oh this? this is straight Wild Turkey, I don't drink anything else because that would be just wussy...oh I didn't mean you were wussy...." 
Yes. And then there is the pool banter:  
"Hey wanna play?" 
"I'm tails you're heads, mmm... tails! I break!" 
"Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, it looks like we're smalls"  
"Damn!" 
"Nice shot!" 
"Sexy shot!" 
"Are you sure you're not a pool shark?" 
"OOooh just missed!" 
Insert "Your turn" in every second phrase on average. Then there is the whole hand shaking thing...and the loser tries to sink his balls after the black one is sunk, oh and sometimes during play there is the comical shots...in fact that's the only thing I like about going to pubs, the games of pool. The B man....I think I impressed him last night, I think he wants to get to know me better since the first time I met him, which was the night that I found 120 bucks, oh and I'm sure CB has told him about our sex life, so yeah...you know guys...I better go, I have to clean my room (somethings never change) and I have to hm...you know...continue playing Zelda...*sigh* I want those damn chests...

       woke in a mess, of my own filth, just lay there blinking, I guessed the time to be around 2pm, I didn't go to that interview, and for some heartfelt reason I felt good about it. I don't want to travel so god damn far for it, it's just not ...not...right...fuck...I have done that. the whole travelling thing,  so next freakin' phase please. Can't smoke too much these days because of my throat, but I am eating toast, so perhaps afterwards. What? yeah fucked CB and then realised my mother was paying me a visit, it was like something out of a horror movie, knowing she must've heard us fuck, she didn't bring me my quilt so I was like, ah who cares if she heard me, I'm mad. Did some laundry, sat in the sun for 20 minutes till I got bored. I felt really seedy...really fucking gross, so I took a shower, tired started to do some dishes until Been said we should take a break, I played some Zelda then we all played Monkeyball, and then I get a phone call telling me...uh that I have to work tonight. ARgh. Argh, BITE, argh, I felt like shit, I had vacummed the inside of my head the night before, all I wanted was to sit quietly chain smoking. But my sore throat and Thinya's pleading stopped all those creamy plans...god dammit....it's just too hard...but it was good. Man, that's it, I'm watching Baseketball on DVD, for 20 bucks, that was a steal.

       Don't you hate it when you have to go to the toilet at the most important time? It's something that has plagued me since I was a child. Fucking crazy bitch...oh boy I am just a little stoned, I uh watched Drop Dead Fred again man...it was just the way I remembered it, like the fuzzy troll doll under Liz's bed, like those great quotes "Ooh cobwebs!", "Pirates!", "No panties!, noooo PANTIES!!!!", it's such a great film, a childhood moment just trapped in a loop right here right now. Stiffi and Cleari came over and they brought homemade chocolate almond things...made with roasted almonds and Lindt chocolate, so creamy so smooth. Just announced to my boy that talking about chocolate has made me hunger for it, so he is making me some fudge pop tarts. har har, looove being in a relationship. Just thinking about that, brings a smile to my face, knowing that I will snuggle with him tonight and that makes me feel happy, just a moment ago I finished playing Zelda, and that game represents where my dreams take place, where there is a freedom to explore, to move on, to find that missing Link...har, har. Yeah I'm pretty fucked up, watched the shit out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, my second favorite film of all time, it's so close to my first "GroundHog Day", really close, that perhaps it shouldn't be my second favorite film, it should be number 1.5 ... yeah if I could make a list it would go something like this... 
 1. Groundhog Day 
 1.5. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 
 2. girl, interrupted 
 3. Fight Club 
 4. Almost Famous 
 5. Amelie 
Anyways, playing Zelda has really taught me something, that stoner logic is so great because it's fearless. Love that concept, no fear, fearless. CB's favorite 5 are: 
 1. All of the Hammerhorror films with Christopher Lee as Dracula 
 1.5. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
 2. Fire Walk With Me 
 2.25 Fists of Fury 
 2.5 Nosferatu 
 3. Ninja Scroll 
 3.5. Zu: The Warriors of the Magic Mountain 
 4. Pulp Fiction 
 4.5 Big Trouble in Little China 
 5. Back to the Future I and II 
Oh, and #57 is CB's list is  urlLink "Tango and Cash"  I felt the need to mention that.  Something, I was supposed to write something..oh well it's gone. CB's list is great, my one seems a little gay...but that's because I'm not quite myself today....shit damn you insecurity! I meant to say that my list is a stoner one right now, I hold the right to change it anytime I wish so nywah! Hmm...he is uh rambling about other movies to add, I'm feeling so tired, and I don't want any job that is going to waste more than an hour of my day, so what am I going to do tomorrow? you know I think I will call  Tel-thieve-stra tomorrow and talk to them about our bills, and then do some laundry and bask in the early morning sun, because life is so good and I am so glad to be in it. yah!  
 Quote of the Day:  
"you....you...PUSSYDICK!!!" Been yelling at a taxi driver who couldn't drive to save his life, who sidewiped us and nearly killed us. Which kinda reminded me of that manga series Angel" that I watched many years ago, although in that series she yelled "Fuck and Piss!!!!" when their car exploded. Har, Har, I love words. I'm not tired, I do not want to go to bed... I do not want to go to bed, I may be suffering from Insomnia.... 
  Quote of the Day 2:   
"Have you ever seen yourself on Television?" 
"No. never! this is my first time!" 
"How do you think you look?" 
"Sensational! I look so  real!!!! "  Gretel and Reggie from TV series "Big Brother", the fucking moron who claimed she looked "real" was Reggie.

       So why no updates? I have now fallen into the world of Zelda and have been playing it a lot, oh and our computer blew up, which is a shame, but we have a laptop so in reality it's Link that has my upmost attention. Tonight Bri came over along with BE-Dan and we brought about a ton of ice cream and condensed milk from IGA and now it's "Shadow of a Vampire" time, William DeFoe is really creepy in this, in fact the whole film is slightly creepy and I now know why CB loves it so much, it's really an exploration of the dark side of the human psyche, the devoured, the devouree, the wanting to possess....it's slightly sexy, in that careless egocentric way....we are but a handful of sinners in this universe...I'm sure this is such trite so called "evil"....I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. Exercising a lot, everyday, waking up late, painting and becoming scared, need to do more, to be more, to cry. It seems so futile at the end of the day, what do you have? What the fuck are you supposed to figure out? I surround myself with stories with love with art, I read and become enraged of the terrible injustices of the world...what's it supposed to mean? To some women they think...you have a man who is completly in love with you, you have a bohemian lifestyle, you can get a job you can travel...how can you not be happy? don't know....fuck...sometimes I just don't want to be a part of this world, it's tiredsome and too bitter and perhaps I'm too cynical. I am in love, yes and I share all this with him, and I am happy to have him, but I'm not happy with my life, I am not making a difference, and I am not influencing anyone...and when I am doing those things perhaps I will be happy and perhaps I can look at him and fully give all of myself to our happiness, right now I just take him as a comfort and although I love him he just isn't enough...he helps though....he really does and if it weren't for him I would be choking and I know it.  
 Quote of the Day   
"I said it like Link and I saved it like Link!" stoned and laughing because I caught the falling cigarette with a "AY!" . Oh today CB made a profit of $20 because he was honest to an EB cashier, and he scored a Zelda guide for free. I uh think that I am going to have nightmares about Nosferatu after this.....

       Went out today to drop in a form in a little place...where everyone is dressed in tracksuit pants...then had a long talk with CB...who you know....I love very much but we are in a weird stage where nothing is working at home and that is putting a stress on good old CB...he said a part of him wants to be single...can you imagine? Now the question arises, single....I don't want to be single and I don't want to be with someone who wants to be single...so I cried and I cried and it hurt but I told him about my self preservation which is...if you foresee heartache...GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT. We both cried...and I don't know...he said he wouldn't leave because he loved me and because he doesn't want to hurt me....a little selfish part of me accepts it and wants to believe him but I will know the next time he feels like breaking out...because that's when I will set him free...like going out with me is a burden of a jail sentence....fuck it's so not. Any of my past boyfriends would say that I gave them the most freedom and that is true....I don't give a fuck what they do and I will never judge them for it unless it's shooting smack or cheating on me. Those are two simple fucking rules, don't you agree? Go out with your buddies, get messed up and chat up a few girls, I don't give a fuck, but just don't touch them and eventually stagger home. Man... I don't know it's all fruit salad in my head. I went out also to see Sexy Bread perform, his band is called The Ross Orbit Stack, and they were really good, a little too Radiohead-ish but apart from that, they were very..ah sexy? :)  
Also another band that played Riff Random, amazing, when they were playing me and Been were chain smoking and I used her as my personal ashtray, the many times I ashed on that girl...it was so dirty. It was good to go out, it really was, I don't know how to explain it, but there was a stage where I really didn't want to talk to anyone...I just didn't get it..the whole....conversation....I became really unept...I really have to stop getting wasted...I don't think Loz remembers me straight...that's crazy. I'm going to see her tomorrow at her party after Bri and I go to dinner. Alright...I have to stop writing shit...I had a really good quote of the day but I forgot it...  
  Listening to:    
"and then this chick comes up to me and says aren't you that dude..? and I'm like..WHATEVER..." - Liam Lynch "United Stated of Whatever" 
and this is my current favorite song, I managed to download this as a commercial for Zelda (don't judge me!) I don't think the lyrics are totally right..but here goes..:  
"Link 
Has come to town 
Come to save  
The Princess Zelda 
Ganon put her away 
Now the children don't play 
But they will  
when Link saves the day 
Hallelujah! 
Now Link fill up your hearts 
So you can shoot up 
Your sword with power" 
There are more words but I think...I've too far already...

       I just laughed my ass off reading Bri's blog, one of the latter entries, man I have MISSED being able to be online....speaking of Bri... Don't worry your money has been wired should be there by Friday, I called the Bank. We are different banks you know.... -nudge- Don't you think it's a touch retarded that they can't wire it sooner? It's like commonwealth is afraid of receiving money from St George...  
I think I will wait until time proves this tender legal. -twiddle thumbs-.
I hate Capitalism.. which translates that to..
"To send money costs money and since we all have to pay I will push it end of the line...we push ahead only our kind, our money and our interests." 
Yeah...banks... let's rob one. I'm serious. Well no... no.. all those tellers and banking staff will be fired...they have to make the losses *somehow*... so yeah..perhaps not.. 
Just downloaded an amazing mpeg...Hole's "Violet", grrrrrrrl rock, I've been in that mood since watching Tank Girl two days ago.  
I ...hehe...can't sleep...but this is my favorite Bri quote (from blog) 
  “TWATCUNT! CHAIRSUCKER! GOLDFISHSHIT! SHIRTFUCKER! FUCKING CLOCKHEAD LASAGNEPRICK PHONEBOY!"   Yeah soooo amusing @ 5:40am, I'm fucking buzzin...I want a cigarette.... 
I want sleep but am morbidly afraid of it... I don't really want to phone Telstra tomorrow but who cares...I have to do it... REMIND ME...SOMEONE.... my memory is being eaten by coffee... yeah it's not me or age or anything...I can't believe I got purple bitche's blog address....this should be so fucking fun...(sarcasm) please stop me from myself, she is so boring...when she gets to heaven, the Gods would be tempted to recycle her excusable soul in an attempt for her to gain one...or at least pick up a personality... 
Do you see how casually I can do that? Insult her like that? It's not even a challange....I've been reading a lot of blogs lately and my favorite is greenfairy.com, because she at least bitches with an agenda, which means that she actually has...self esteem. Bitch. Har.

       "Is it all going to be ok?" Time to get the hell out, out, out, OUT. Time to accept responsibility and to do something about it, something that can benefit the voice in my soul that just says, Okay accept it....you know the past? those evil scars that you carry around because of a few bad phases in High School? You have to beat them...because you are LOSING IT...LOSING....argh....Fuck man!!! Tear!! TEAR! THAT fucking DENIAL OUT....you who scorn those swimming in their incestous blankets of negativity, you are living such a sorry excuse of a life....such a terrible waste of time....it reminds me of that girl in Billy Madison who said, "Some people go about their lives like lumps of crap...." yeah yeah...I know could I be anymore BORING? but I just want to live...so very much...I have so much knowledge all stored in here, so much insight and this world is such a fucking trap, an evil label of standards that are making me miserable, is it because I can't join? Is it because it's all a joke and no-one has told me the punch line? Actually the thing is...it's a sad pathetic infested world and it's so elitist it's actually lethal for my integrity to think that I could be happy in that vise of commercialism and hype. Yawn. Let's go...interesting things..  
I beat Zelda the WindWaker on the gamecube today. 
...{pause}.... 
Ok try again  
I actually realised my laziness has morphed into a separate being who is trying to take over my life. 
No.. 
Ahem.  
I ate some donuts. 
I believe I will now go and install some software...which reminds me, I fucking hate ICQ, don't bother to keep my name on there, it's a piece of lint that gets up my nostril...it's too commercial...drop me a line @  urlLink  takethecatout@hotmail.com   and we will converse in a little mail like way which should be much more fucking enlightning...that a little message that says uh-oh you're wasting your life....but I have windows messenger except I don't know how to use it...and I'm up to my forehead in Microsoft whoredom...I'm not even going to fucking bother... 
Been reading a lot of political stuff again and I am so sorry Americans but where the fuck is your head? What the HELL is that HELL?? I feel something for you that the present time I can't express, it's too deep in the shame that you bestow upon the world, it's too big to say in a few words what your poisoned greed has cost .... human life is so cheap isn't it? Some in the Western World know it and want to escape it, they refuse to clothe themselves in companies of lies and explotation and they get nothing...liberation is mental at this stage but you the rich Republicans know the only way to trap the mind is through the physical realm of money, poverty and ambition. Am I bitter? All I want is a dryer and a steady income to pay the bills, maybe see some German castles before I turn 30, I don't want to do anything....but you know... I am a painter and I feel people are more important that my own ugly head on a stick...slogged and worked, guilty and vicious. SO...so...so....yeah this is my insanity....I really have to stop playing Japanese games...my speech is sounding like Gannons...har har... 
Peace, really, we should be able to eat our MacDonalds and not look sadly at the heavily processed meat...KNOWING that a kid was paid $7AUS an hour to pry it from the freezer and flip it ....KNOWING.. that the meat we are eating is deep fried and unhealthy, knowing that the company makes so much profit from it's unnerving blatant disregard for social and environmental issues. We should just eat the fucking things and shut up. We wanted cheap ass food and we don't care who has to resort to slave labour to keep the prices down and our bellies full of lard. Fuck this society sometimes...Urgh it makes me so damn mad!

       It's a little better...um...played a tired game of Windwaker till 6am this morning, with Been who was up chatting, she is right now on some date with someone, who is hopefully special but she doesn't want to jinx it..so no jinxs and it's not a date..etc..etc....Anyhoo....Bri came over and fixed the computer so it's now up and running, I am very exhausted and weep a little knowing that tomorrow is somewhat of Wank-a-Link confrontation, I have to tell them why I don't have a job as yet...I don't understand, sometimes I don't even want to try...is the lives of all those unemployed people living in Redfern as difficult as mine? I am filled with horrid dread of that place...it sickens me...surely they are not as viciously chased as I am...they don't seem deturbed...hm....CB and I are sharing a bottle of Wild Turkey, my painting is sitting there...looking at me in expectation...there is too many things to do on the computer and I am too fucking tired to do it...I woke up at 3pm to the sounds of Oprah (again) and yet it's 10pm and I'm tired? I have to get up at 7AM tomorrow...too many numbers to remember...yeah I know. It's too cold and I had to wait 3 hours for my Egyptian towel to dry....over the heater....it's kinda laughable....I miss listening to music ...me and Been talked about mediocrity the other night and it was ....you know where you feel your voice is silent? and nothing you say really means anything? the feeling of awkardness and banality are too strong in me to even let my true self express my fraustrations. I have to buy some white zinc paint....I might do tomorrow....because you know...I just have to.

       She looks like the real thing 
She tastes like the real thing 
My fake plastic love. 
But I can’t help the feelingr 
I could blow through the ceiling 
If I just turn and RUN  
And it wears me out, it wears me out 
It wears me out, it wears me out. 
I am sick of blaming pot for my mood swings, they just intesify what is already there, and I know it, and I push and push myself into seemingly vat of denial and I laugh over the simple fucking fact that I got this upset this emotionally drained, this CHOKED over a shitty video game, YES I am fucking childish and I want to rip it out, rip it out kill it, destroy it, I don't want to be here, I just want to be in the Great Sea, and I just don't want to face real dangers and I never ever want to grow up because this just hurts...you know they said I had issues I needed to deal with and boy was she ever right...but it was over a video game as well....all of my clothes are dirty....I have forgotten how to take care of myself...I am falling into this abyss of depression and god dammit it feels good, dirty as I said before, painful and familiar and I will sit here and wait for everyone to fall asleep smoking CB's cigarettes until they all go to bed and I will escape to a land where I am a little boy clad in green and all I have to do is sail, find treasure and save the world.

       I don't understand, do you remember the film Amadeus? if you haven't seen it, please watch it....I just feel like Antonio Salieri, the saint of the Mediocre, I totally feel like I can't be good at anything, like no matter where I go someone is going to be that little bit better and that little bit more passionate, that aggression...what's it called? ambition...look I just want to try my hand at a few things, things that I have never done before but it just feels so futile when others just do it better. Fucking hell...my competitive drive is absolutely so erratic, it's just wanting to be good at something, anything for like a moment, I'm not a good painter, I'm not a good drawer, I'm not a good designer, I'm not a good writer, I'm not a good gamer, I can't talk eloquently, I don't dress well, I have a mediocre face, a mediocre body, a mediocre personality, I don't know anything and I talk about nothing and always at the wrong time. I am lost in a childhood that made no sense, I seek revengeful dreams, I have too many regrets, at times like these I just can't let go of the negativity, and it eats at me, and I fucking resent it, losing myself in a circular vise of self loathing. I wanted something so simple, so simple like for ONE night just be a Monkey Ball champion, but I lost and I felt bad because I lost all confidence so easily, listening to his retorts and malicious laughing just like I was doing when I was winning and I know it's fucking karma but all I wanted was to be champion for one freaking day! Bri said I am not childish but I am, I want to win at something! I want to get out of this fucking rut but I do not have the confidence, the passion the will, too full of Arian energy tonight that is going insane, I don't know what to do, today the Monkey Ball thing is just a metaphor, a metaphor on how today I dug into my savings and saw that I do not have anything, in this world where security is everything, I have none, everything is reliant on a few twists of fate and emotional manipulation. I hate being the leech I want to be generous, I just hate this hate this and I can't get out of it, do I want to be here? Of course I don't but I don't know what else I could be...and I just don't love myself enough to try...I'm sorry but I don't. How can I be in a relationship and not love myself? I don't know, right now as evil and as kiddish as this sounds, I hate my feelings towards him, right now I just want to be a 5 year old and say, how could you intimidate me like that??? HOW?? but you know, it's just a game, just a simple baby game and I'm using it as a metaphor for my life, I want to be someone else or I'll explode....I want to be someone else or I'll explode...I've resorted to Radiohead lyrics...but I am so small, so smelly, just...so badly wired...I remember when I was 19 and I was doing etchings and I was drinking tequila and playing chess with Liam, and I had no qualms, nothing to worry about, all I had was a dream to be a painter and I actually applied it and I was alive for those years, and I just haven't felt that....carefree...means to be confined...to be put somewhere given rules and time....because it's this endless time, the endless chores, the endless expectations and hedonistic past times that are just eating at me....and all I want to do is be a mediocre painter....that's all I want to be....everyone is living their dream someway, and I am just sitting here feeling bitter because I wasn't strong enough to resist a few fucking taunts. Screw it....screw it....I'm trying to remember a Radiohead song..or even a quote....

       They know how to break girls like you....I've been listening to a lot of Hole lately. Also watched Igby goes down...fab film, really go see it for some dark dark evil comedy, loved it. Well last post I explained the whole "CB and Me" fiasco, but because blogger.com is a piece of shit....no..actually I blame the internet. It's just bad, bad, bad - the post is gone, so a quick recap: I have explained that I can go into wayward spiralling depressions very, very easily, why? because somehow I can ignore my intelligence when things go wrong, I also listen to what I want to hear not what the person is actually saying. So he said he wanted to be single, actually he said he missed being single, for the simple fact that he was always comfortable, it was easy and nothing ever changed in his life. He's a taurus, he enjoyed his solitary life, his stability, so he moved in with a bohemian hedonistic drug addicted artist with friends from all walks of life and nothing in his shelter, his home, was the same ever again, but he said that was his problem, his own mentality that he has to get over because he couldn't bear not to be with me... Aw...sweet huh? Are we that different? Actually we are really compatible, it's just that I'm 100% more crazy. It will work out, it always does, he is always laughing and having a good time, it's about fucking time that he embraced his new life...yah... 
On other news, had a long talk with Vixs about life and what not, amidst a bottle of Bicardi and spliffs, and she said that she was going to end it with Roach Boy, yeah I know wasn't that already done? apparently not, she had promised me that ages ago and it looks like she was still fucking him, I guess sexual exploration is important no matter what the cost... Hmm-Hmm...oh well she said that she had to stop because of all the lying and all the emotional bullshit, I mean the guy has a girlfriend and is a Roach....need I say more? More later I have to go and get some bread, Beenie is anxious....

       the shift key is fucked so very few capital letters on today's post. last night was friday and every friday i go out to dinner with bri, last night little BEdan came along and well...he gave me the shits, with his little perfectionist attitude....damn those virgos...anyways but it wasn't so bad, apart that in the rating system, the greek restaurant that we went to got a 3.5/10 from bri, it was okay...apart from the burnt octopus i ordered....but afterwards we rented heaps of videos and dvds and went back home to get stoned well we didn't plan to get stoned, what happened was that i opened what i *thought* was *my* packet of tabacco in search of papers because CB wanted a cigarette, and lord behold I see what i thought were two cigarettes but they were two joints, i foolishly thought they were cigarettes and thought briefly...when did i roll them? did beenie roll them for later? i noticed they were joints when CB sparked up and that weird pot smell was coming from him...so yeah we all took puffs apart from bri who hates smoking....when vixs and oj came home from the placebo concert...man they were sooo mad at me and woke me up in a state of confusion oh and i said something like....i didn't smoke the whole thing, been and gubs also smoked..etc...etc...which prompted an angry been to come into my room and shout that she wasn't the only one who smoked and that it was bullshit and i was like...fine! you don't want any responsibility, i smoked the whole thing and i'll pay her back ok? now leave me alone i want to sleep! then she got all weird and i think she said something like... i will pay for my share but i didnt know it was hers and she said i told her that it was mine. now i was stoned when she got home, so fuck... i don't know what i said, but it was inevitable. she didnt give me a chance to say it wasn't mine because i was too fucked up and she was too eager to smoke some, so you know whatever. i should say something about thursday...ah yes me and beenie went to broadway to go see a movie, we watched malibu's most wanted and it was so bad....so very very bad. jamie kennedy should be shot for crimes of crap....me and been wanted to walk out of that movie so bad...the two black guys who were actors....i wanted to kill them....and if i was link....i would've...travelled to america and maimed them! at least....anyways gotta go and do some stuff. more later.

       I am soooo bored, Been said to wake her in an hour... my teeth feel like they are about to jump out of my mouth *that's* how furry they are...I'm soo restless...do you like the new little addition to my blog? pretty neat huh? *nudge* So yeah, so freaking bored that I bring you another He-Man episode...I can almost hear your inner children cry..."Oh please stop the raping!" but I must continue...because....I have to amuse myself somehow.  
Little Update on the House:  
The cats are trying to kill each other, CB has a sore throat and sounds hoarse and croaky, and no amount of Butter Menthols helps, Vixs is fine, she's at Edwire's house (ha, his name keeps changing...you will never know who he is! and no it's not Roach Boy) oh and Been is funky, me and her have been doing Pilates again, my muscles feel lean and limber. Too bad about the fat surrounding them...yes....what to do about that....hack it to pieces! Actually that reminds me that last night, just before me and Been did Pilates, David Letterman was on and he had on that guy who had to hack his own arm off recently, yeah I know, there's like... 5 a year....but the current one...well He got a plastic arm, lucky him....Been was all like, we are so blessed to have arms and legs and sight...we should think about that before we bitch and moan about how fat/ugly we are. And I thought....man that's so depressing....so depressing.....poor dude...pass the coke....no really poor dude.  Shit, the guy had it tough...but you know what I truly feel? Deep down in my heart? I'm so sorry vigilantes of Political Correctness or what nuts .... buuuuut....
  Why the fuck would you go to a canyon to hike? Why!?! WHY!??!?!?!??!?!??!   Stay home...or go to Ireland and drink Ale...visit Paris and eat crossaints...what could POSSIBLY happen to you then? Choke on a piece of melt in your mouth BUTTER?!? god forbid...grrrr....urge to maim....increasing...
People...if you are going to climb nature...in your attempt to "fully experience her" or "regain control of your domain" you're a fucknut.  You will LOSE, she's a lot older, a lot wiser and doesn't take shit and she HATES US right now....so if I were you...leave the exploring to Human Goats (you know those people that have been doing it for 45 years...or were born in the Mountains....or if they are Lap people...or come from Iceland...of American Indians...) and just sit back and enjoy sweet countryside or evil polluted Babylon cities...

       I haven't slept in awhile, but it's so fucking over-rated, big deal. I remember when I liked to sleep, it was such a blessing, now it's just filled with unfulfilled dreams, I have become impulsive in my thoughts, trying to comfort myself because of my uncertanity...like.."Oh wouldn't it be great if I had a million dollars?" and I would day dream about it for hours...just thinking that it could be that easy....terrible....terrible...people like me are natural criminals...did you know that? There is a reason why I'm not one though...I just don't like cops, I don't like courts....and the idea of going to prison sounds like it would bore me to freakin' tears, and also...let's not forget that I'm too intelligent...I know how the justice system works....you hurt a corporate company, grab a little cash to grease your life a little and they CAN you, so fucking hard that you will be wondering what the FUCK happened....I have always wondered...why is it so easy to track down money but not murdered people? hmm...maybe all I need is to rob a Armaguard truck....hehe...just kidding. No, I'm not. Hahah Yeah I am, I don't want money that fucking badly, geez....onto next subject...I watched an episode of "You Can't Do That On Television", and old Canadian show...brought back a lot of memories, a lot of fun...although I liked it when I was a kid...I think I found Lisa just so damn irritating...and they *do* say "aboot"...crazy...hmm maybe I didn't like it that much....maybe it was just something to watch when Thundercats wasn't on...speaking of Thundercats, I downloaded three...count them 3 bad .avi files from Kaaza Lite (No whore Kaaza will *ever* touch this system, same for E-Donkey....evil whore....evil evil EVIL whore...) But just now I managed to grab a working .asf file and I am shittin' beams! I just watched it...well the beginning...and oh lord...OOooh lord, I felt that pang you know? that pang that says... "I remember running from school to watch this, how I would threaten anyone with certain death if they even LOOKED at the TV channel knob thing... (this was before remote controls darlings, yes I am old...so very old..) that feeling of utter awe...." The animations by today's standards is pretty good not great, but when I was a child I thought it was the best art in the world, I hehe, I remember wanting to be Cheetrah (I have been calling her Cheetah for 18 years now...how embarrasing....how OLD is that fucking cartoon!?!?!??!?!?!?) Oh man how I wanted to be her, so pretty, so fast and so smart. Hmm. Now I am a 24 year old slug.....what happened? I think I might do a Thundercats cartoon spread soon... just gotta find pictures, I hope I'm not treading on anyone's copyright laws, if anyone really has a problem with the pictures,  urlLink  email me   labelling the email...with...something like... "I read your blog....who's your lawyer?" and maybe I won't mistake you for spam... PLEASE be clear you are from the blogging world and not the I-want-to-erect-your-penis-to-monstrous-proportions world....I've been deleting too much shit lately.

I'll like to see you try......and get past my skimpy outfit!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"I'm soooooo hiiiigh....am I a bird? or is this a new look that I adopted 
 when no-one was looking?...Yah!

       I am having an epiphany...it's a crazy time and those who fear enlightment are such dissapointments....they are trully the blackest bruise on the human soul. Last night around 3AM I was reading a lot of Sylvia Plath, who is going to be played by Gwenyth Paltrow (WTF??? Hey Hollywood....where the fuck are you getting your version of the story? Sylvia was a woman of amazing talent who was tormented with a loathing for life, a damaged sense of denial  and most importantly she was filled with loathing for her father, Paltrow is a daddy's little girl, a mediocrity, a complete hysterical dramatic queen who's hate was pale because it was narcissistic) Anyways and reading a lot of her work made me realise that writing is a tool that is not meant to be descriptive of the banal superficialiaty of life...it was something deeper, an emotional print of the experience, a soulful understanding, but what's most terrible is that even writers are writing superficial shit because it sells...my god don't feed the same old tripe to these people, to help me remain unevolved, revolutionase! enlight! If you were given a gift use it for the greater good.....come on!  
Which reminds me...I'm stoned..but I'm remembring  how last night ...oh damn my memory is fading....need to pee...*again?* and oh wait here it comes, so when I was reading some ol' Plath I came across a collection of her famous quotes,  and one of the quotes was "I talk to God, but the sky is empty".

       Watched Terminator 3 last night......I liked it, it was just the usual sci fi over budgeted violent flick, so it was like good times. CB got the the DVD of Judgement Day the other day and watching that and then watching the third one in the same week was pretty fucking awesome. It's not exactly an intelligent film, sci fi isn't really intelligent ...more imaginative you know? And the imagination of these movies... amazing. What got me the most was the sensitivity that it approach that human question... are we meant to go on? Is there an end to this fucked up humanity? Well of course our end is going to be by our hands....or is it? Of course it is...says the pessimist in me....look at all our bombs....ah yes the bombs...the stupid over protective paranoid induced bombs... 
I wish everyone would just toke and forget about all that bullshit, it's jut inhumane to think that power solves anything, power is evil, it's the root of arrogance, it's what every demon wants, total and utter control. Over everyone and everything...speaking about control I am very sick these days I think it's urine poisoning, I don't think my kidneys are healthy, I keep putting off going to see the doctor but I could die...would that be such a bad thing? In some ways yeah because I haven't done everything I wanted to do...not even close...I'm starting to feel sad again...slap! Okay much better. Back to the film because I'm starting to think that talking about my kidneys and my depression is just going uh...round and round, seems I like to repeat myself. So uh.. Terminator had Nick Stahl instead of Edward Furlong...Ha...Okay....nice change, but there was no real character development, no real dialogue but who needs that when you have kick ass special effects? Hmm, I'm just being a purist, but all in all I enjoyed it, I managed to drink a large coke and not rapture myself half way ...ah back to my kidneys....but yeah I liked it, I kept whispering to CB and Fuckmaster 2000 comments throughout the film which made them giggle heartedly and I shushed a couple of Indians (well I thought they were Asian, but CB says they weren't, it was pretty dark) fellows behind me who kept talking really loudly because....fuck man I wanted the EXPERIENCE...so I told them to shut the hell up. I *whispered* in english....which shouldn't make it okay...but it does. Vixs just called me and she went to her dad's house today and drank too much red wine, but you know that's cool...red wine is good for you... I like her dad...he's a bit of a nutter but he's okay he at least is intelligent and political...ah how I love political people... I should recommend...(again) these two sites:
Erich Blumrich and Mark Fiore
Please...read up, never stop believing that your thoughts count and be ready to fight, because just maybe soon there will be a revolution and you don't want to be stranded in denial, sedation and utter hopelessness. I should stop writing...I'm really tired again...I think it's the withdrawl of not having the Gamecube...

       Urgh, I know that this is because I am sick and perhaps I don't mean it, but the smell got me real mad when I came down stairs and found them smoking weed, them meaning Vixs and CB, because fuck, the rule should be no godamn smoking in the house, and they were nice about it and stuff but I for a split moment turned into those evil non smokers that Bill Hicks used to make fun of, but I can actually feel the toxic fumes try and get into my chest, it's horrible. Pretty realistically I will one day have a cigarette, but I don't think it will be for another couple of years, this illness really opened my eyes. I was in a fevered state, couldn't move and was burning up wanting to die, my chest heaving like some hollowed out cavity, fuck. So anyways did you guys know there was going to be a Jason Vs Freddy flick? you know the dude from the Halloween movies, and Freddy as in Freddy Krugger from the Nightmare flicks? man that's just insane you can watch the trailer  urlLink  here   if you like. I like broadband...hehe.

I am still wondering what the hell she got so worked up about...but you know....I hate being defamed or being told I have a superiority complex. Which to anyone that knows me...that's just bullocks. Confidence in the way the world works...using logic...I mean how is that having a superiority complex? I dunno...I just thought it was using your brain

       Just came back from Lillipilli and we all had a great time, Beenie, Brian and I got tipsy on white wine and had the most delicious food, it was amazing. However right now I feel like shit because of this horrible flu/chest infection/SARS infliction on my very soul...god dammit it's so painful, I don't know how I am going to face tomorrow....I will have to call mum, tell her that I am so sorry but I am going to have to cancel tomorrow...maybe...depending on how I feel in the morning. If I could describe this illness to you...I will say that it's like a giant spider sucking onto my lungs telling me that I am TOO OLD for destructive behaviour, get over it! what a shout.  
Me and Brian had a long talk and stuff, sorry to hear that Wurz isn't coming to Triv night, actually it's kinda funny.  
Actually this part was the funniest... 
Did I ask for opinions?  
... when you post something publicly you will get comments, it's called publishing. 
Oh and if you think I push my relationship onto you, get fucking over it, he's a big part of my life, a big part of my blog, and with one click of a mouse you can close me forever. Simple.

I just finished reading her latest post...and have to say that oh boy...you can't give favours so easily ...I remember when I was a kid and telling everyone I was a cat, no...not because I had a fetish for Thundercats, but because people had to fight to get me to do what they wanted, very feline, you see I was pretty sexually fraustrated and then I met CB and I was like..whoa...DICK! but I gave it 2 weeks...to make sure he liked my company, because I sure as hell liked his...getting to know him, his quiet intelligence, his respect and adorable quirks...sure enough the sex was explosive and nearly 11 months later...I am still in love with him as the first moment I laid eyes on him. Sure now I know about his freaky insecure arrogance (i.e "I can't believe how wrong you are!!") and his evil bed habits (i.e as soon as I touch him... "Hon..I need to sleep.." what is wrong with a hug!??!) but you know....those are the weird things you have to put up because noone is perfect, and to quote Eddie Murphy, don't look for perfect, that person doesn't exist, look for someone who is perfect for you, in other words, someone who is just as fucked up as you. Highlight FUCKED UP...it works if you don't idealise but just simply accept and respect the person...trust me...sex is soooo much better...so relaxed...and the affection is great!

       I totally feel like shit, ended up cleaning the keyboard and fixing the shift key, hurrah! But yeah other than that I've been coughing up so hard that my throat is raw....I wouldn't be surprised if it's starts bleeding soon. Had a long hard talk with myself in the shower, and I am so over smoking, I realise that it's just holding onto something that I should've given up years ago, it's not that big a deal, it's just cigarettes, and I'm too tired to be sick, to be lethargic to actually give a fuck that little rolls of poison are demanding my very soul. I say, Hey cigarettes, take a fucking HIKE. Sick of spending money, time, the smell! oh god the smell! and for what? Cigarettes are not satisfying, they are just a habit, a dirty time consuming habit. Only people, who are idle, smoke. I should have no time to be idle...being idle is numbing. God damn I feel like shit, my mother's birthday is today (Happy Birthday you old bird... 48!?!? ouch) and she looks fabby, she has lost sooo much weight, she is a size 13!!! 13!! Can you believe it? It's a size I just made up, meaning that she wears size 14 but they are floppy on her, but she is too hippy for size 12....so yeah that's so cool. She used to be size 20... That’s a pretty good dramatic change! I can do that, I mean I think that if you eliminate pasta, soft drinks, chocolate and most sugars leave in honey and fruit stuff, take walks and do Pilates, don't eat like a pig. You'll be great. She does this weird cabbage soup thing, and she has been walking for 30 minutes a day... it's totally inspired me, just because I'm a fatty and I am so tired of being a fatty. Not for the vain I NEED A MAN thing, (I have a man, remember CB?) it's because I'm so tired of not taking care of myself...it's so sad really...I generally don't like myself, and so don't take care of my physical well being, I mean I just wash my face with Neutragena (!?!?!?) which is like 3 bucks a month's worth of a translucent bar, and maybe I do Pilates three times a fortnight. And I eat shit, food wastage...because I'm too lazy to cook, and when I do cook it's tasty things, but it's high in carbs. But lately I have given up on food and generally don't eat much until Friday. Then that's going out, the restaurants which are fun for the experience, and I really enjoy it. The thing is...to train the body to not crave food as comfort...that's what boyfriends are for, that's what playing Zelda is for...hmm. I don't know, it's one of those weeks...you know?  
Been surfing the net for awhile now, and have subscribed to two Sim sites, man I don't know why, probably a waste of money, but I got some nice beds for my Sims, but the funny thing is that I hardly play anymore, I think this week I have been really freaky with money, same as CB, he went drinking on Tuesday and spent all his money. Funny, I think it's great he's going out without me, it clears his mind and he can tell me all about it, which is great. He's a natural story teller. I miss him, should call him soon. I've been coughing for like 15 minutes straight....too weak to type...more later.

       Damn sorry guys for the lack of posts sunday was busy because BGDan came over (not to be confused with BEDan) and he is such a big character you have to devote time to the scamp, so monday rolled on and Beenie got sick...today rolled on and I got sick...it's fucking terrible coughing and feeling tired, and you know your body is just rebelling agaisnt your stupid lifestyle, but you can't help it...it's some sort of mental block...my coughs are from waaaay deep in me...makes me feel like something is terribly wrong down there...man I want a cigarette.. har, har, i just don't learn do I?? But there is a new rule in the house, no smoking in the living room, kitchen, well any public space, I'm sure bedrooms are okay...that rule is going to help me quit for sure....I'm just too fucking lazy. Too tired now to continue...but in the next few days my Thunder Cats spread will soon be available, so stay tuned.

        6 Blocks of Turkish Delight...later... 
Too sweet, it's killing me and I actually now believe in too much sugar...I never believed there was food without sugar in it...so perhaps I am changing, it's been a rumour in my psyche, change is coming, oh my. I've been gone for awhile because our phone line was accidently cut by Telstra (thanks Corporate Whore, it's not like we fucking actually matter now, do we ....swine?!) Ha, I think I've been reading too much Prisoner of Azkaban because I love that little knight character, Sir Codegen? The way he jumps up and down on his fat pony screaming "Scurvy Cur!"...And about the spelling, that's what Beenie just spelt for me so I dunno...Ah speaking of Beenie, me and her had a domestic about a bottle of toothpaste yesterday after grocery shopping and it resulted in me flying out of her car while it was moving...I can still remember the guy in the car behind her...he had this look of complete shock like.."I can't believe you just did that..." I can't believe it either, especially since I was the one, that screamingly told Been that she was the one in need of a psychiatrist. CB was worried, ah my porn loving boyfriend, how I love him. He was all crazy and worried about me, it was very sweet because when I had jumped from Been's car, I had walked to this little park and had my mad cry session (with the sickness that I've had ...can you just imagine the mucus?) and no one could find me for ages, well I went back because a) I ran out of tissues and b) I really wanted to come back and sort it out. Anyways hmm...it was enlightnening to say the least.  
I went and saw American Pie 3 last night and it was amazing, but what happened was that we window shopped for half an hour and I had to pay for the parking...well Beenie paid half so it was good...but pay for parking? that's just not...even...right....why pay for a space in a building? it's a space that you used for 30 minutes more than you were supposed to...we shoul've gotten it for 3.50 not 7.50....that was just too much... 7.50 is a meal, a week's worth of cat food, a blank VHS, a CD single in 1993....a medium box of Lindor chocolate, a Video Rental, a movie ticket in Wollongong, develop a roll of film, or buy a roll of film, buy a tube of oil paint, a good quality hog hair paint brush, 3 sheets of Stonehedge paper, 3 Mrs Fields cookies...the list is endless. And for some reason I am very depressed. Economic times are not as good these days but you know, money smchoney, who gives a crap about money? It's the shiny things we like....haha. Anyways I'm bored writing so perhaps later. Now I'm off to make chilli!

       I woke up with a new sense of purpose, and it really feels good, I feel healthy which is a bit strange since last night I drowned more than half a bottle of Bacardi, and 1 glass of straight Jack Daniels, plus 2 joints, I know fucked up huh? Also had one cigarette and it really was dumb because I was weak and it didn't even feel nice. Before you go with your groans of dissapointment and evil letters (because I know you care, ha, ha) that slip up let me really realise how much I want to quit. Really serious folks, it's over, those things and me are just no longer friends. I am also going to say that Beenie did not smoke...wo-hoo! I am so proud of her and she is very strong and we must all support her in this evil time of cigarette withdrawl. I've been up since 9am too.... looked everywhere for things to clean and realised that we have to go grocery shopping because we don't have sponges to wash the dishes with...and the dishwashing brush is coated with Vicks Vapo-Rub... eeeew...eeeeeeew....greasy Vaseline stinky shit....also although I feel healthy it's because I'm doped up on drugs and this morning when I opened my eyes I thought my nose and brain had been glued shut...I'm serious. Oh this is funny...CB twisted my arm this morning, in his sleep, perhaps around 6-7am...he grabbed my arm and just twisted it really fucking hard....and I screamed awake and he woke up all shitshitshitshit I'm so sorry!...hmmm....he was having nightmares all night, fuck man I am getting worried. Met the new neighbours, and they are really cool, I think I made a fool of myself when I met them though because I was totally drunk, and I don't remember what I said...but I think it was bad...and embarrasing...something about JS and her flatmate (evil neighbours of ours) and how they like to be nudie....well they DO....but should I have said that? and should I have mentioned our dealer?? like our neighbourhood dealer? what if they are cops??...undercover cops...hmm...no...no..couldn't be... Yeah I have to stop doing all these weird drugs....messing with my mind... 
Well I just finished reading Wurz's latest addition to her blog, and alright, it's all cool. I'll stop there because censure sometimes is a good thing, and I respect Brian, and I know I'm a blunt rude bitch, that's the reason why so many people remember me. Take it or leave it. 
We went out to Kings Cross last night, red light district, Been pushed us into an Adult Store, she's so funny....last night eyed red from so much drinking and smoking joints, she blurted out "I think being a comedian is the only thing I am interested in..." and I was like "Then you are going to have to start performing in comedy clubs, that's how Bill Hicks started" and she got all contrite and said in a small voice.. "yeah..". She'll rock as a stand up...everyone if you see Beenie in the street...push her into a comedy club....it just might stop her pushing me into Adult Stores...I went in there drunk trying on the sequins giggling with a Scooner in my hand....spent 26 bucks on Taxis, and I think I talked to a Drag Queen...but I think that was a dream because I had watched Australian Idol earlier that night....oh man that show is weird! .. what else... I don't know what else I can tell you... except that in 10 minutes I have go wake everyone up... I want those dishes done! I have a lot to do tomorrow.

       I haven't been feeling very well the past two days, I think it's because of the anti biotics, they have made my stomach really fucking angry. So yeah I spent all yesterday asleep, feeling like my whole body was being stretched and my stomach was puking up red shit, which I am assumed was the chicken from Wednesday night, ah so you know blah blah. I haven't smoked since Tuesday, that's 3 days! Aren't you proud? My sister took a photo of me the other day and I looked like SHIT why didn't anyone tell me I looked like a sumo wrestler? You lying fiends...and I considered you friends! More later Vixs needs the computer.

       Alright, so now I'm a little drunk but that's cool. Today was pretty shit, I didn't do the things I was supposed to do, like mail the money orders for the cats and pick up the mail from the Nudie neighbours, all this stuff that I was supposed to do, like pick up some more filters and more tutes for Photoshop, all these things that I was supposed to do and what happened? I got up @11:48am, stumbled downstairs, yawning and helped Been with her assignment, I was on the computer trying to fix my Sim game which I wanted to finish before 1pm but  something happened...Ah yes our landlord came over and sighed and whinged over the state of our carpet. Like that fucking matters, but I guess he's just lost in material hell so you know, kudos to him, I hope he enjoys being a materialistic little demon.  Anyways the girls are trying to talk me into going out but the thing is that I don't have any money and I just wouldn't feel good going out after that big night last Saturday you know? I need a least a week difference, or 5 days, but it's just crazy to go out so soon. Ah they just decided to go without us, that's great because fuck...I can get laid...again. Hehe, nah I'm joking, I wouldn't mind going but I just can't get the energy and I just want to stay drunk in this safe crazy world because my music is here.

       Wow this cold is never going to go away, but I haven't smoked since the party, NO substances thank you very much, and I feel great.  Right now sitting here drinking spicy pumpkin soup, it's a gray morning, and after 1pm I have to go and pay the rent. The last 24 hours have been filled with listening to music, and my collection is going really good, I have resorted to whoring into 128kbps but only if I am desperate to hear the song, and these days desperation is such a way of life, isn't it people? Urgh I hate the lumps of soup mix that refuse to melt..poohtoey! blaah... but luckily I just got one....ONE only...not too shabby. Anyways the bands that I have been desperate to listen to have been Sonic Youth, The Pixies and Silvio Rodriguez. I just downloaded this song called "Commandante Che Guevara" which is about...uh Che Guevara, and it's such a beautiful song, you know the reason why people are so political (well some) is because in the face of humanity our society and our political governments are such shit, they violate our basic laws and rights. The people of Latin America have been treated like animals for over 100 years and when they decided to uprise they were slaughtered, much like Orwell implies in "Animal Farm". I dunno...you are forced to a way of life and you don't have a say. It's so wrong...community spirit, without the bitching and the scandals...which are always funny...that's what I want you know? the ability to talk to people, I still remember one of my lecturers saying that I was living in a bonafide pipe dream and that idealism has no place in this world, because people are dangerous, because people suck. People are robots until you talk to them properly. Everyone has a story and something to say and not everyone is going to be a dangerous criminal, but the government/media like to install that fear into us, to make us accept and appreciate the police force...I have to go to Newtown and pay the rent, in my pocket there is going to be $930.00  
Hmm.... 
Paranoia... 
 Listening to   
"Gaviota, gaviota, blancura de lirio, aire y bailarina, gaviota de asombro" 
which means... 
"Gull, Gull, lily whiteness, wind and a ballerina, Gull of amazement" 
it sounds so much better in spanish, English can be such a clumsy language. It's by Cuban singer Silvio Rodriguez.

       Feel so hung-over....but great hung over. Far Out Chris was crazy, Brendan was just so fucked, kept licking his lips and hugging everyone and then looking at them like they were giant Raptors. I am really tired, too tired to make up crazy names for my crazy friends. Had an amazing time, talks with great people, really fucking bonded and I saw Sal again, and we made plans to meet up, the cutie now works for Virgin, maybe she can get me a job. Like I was telling everyone, I was going insane in the house, and that I was watching too much day time television, now that I think about it, that's what's probably bringing me down, not the weed. Well actually I shouldn't smoke too much, I should quit. Uh...so today is recovery day, you know I can't remember too much about last night except that I judged a Dancing Competition and the Projectionist team won, because Rhett went off, he was doing moves that I haven't seen outside an 80's flash dance film. The end score was 10 to 6 I believe. Rhett's girlfriend is unreal, she was scattered and crazy like everyone there but she was so chilled out, not anxious or nervous or pretentious, people like that, well like me, are so fucking rare. Not to say we are better it's just that we have a better time. Oh look it was just so good, drinking Vodka and lime, Bourbon with lemon wedges, I believe I had 20 drinks, one double vodka and orange, copious amounts of cigarettes and three joints, and I was blissfully talking freely, and confronting people and talking, dancing, and fuck it was just a release. Why is poison such a release? What do healthy people do for a good time? I dunno...I wonder about that sometimes. Bri isn't available to go out for dinner for awhile he said, I want him to have a Trivia Night and to invite his lovely friends, and for everyone to have a good time. One of the great things about last night is that I met around 6 GORGEOUS gay men, and I was like, oh Brian would love this, if Bri was here, the boy would be getting SO laid. Sex is so great, I was having this conversation about love and relationship and sex with my sister, and you know, with her I have the best conversations because we know our blood you know? So we know where we are coming from, and we were talking and she said that I deserve to be happy and no-one should make me feel bad for showing affection and love to my boyfriend, no matter how insecure they are, or how jealous, they have to just get over it, because I should not censure myself for anyone. There was a stage in the party that me and CB were hugging in a huge armchair in front of the fire (the Hippo Bar is just so fucking classy, please if you are anywhere in Sydney, do drop in, they have yellow pool tables and nice security guards) and we were hugging and I had my legs entwined with his and he was smoking, Far out Chris comes up to me and says, "I just want you to know that you guys just got an awwwww, I didn't give it, I actually think you guys are disgusting." and then he laughed. He is so cute.  Anyways I better go because Beenie wants to blog, so later.

       Argh eating lunch now, after nearly breaking my arm on this fucking chair. Ah but coffee tastes good. I won't bore you with the details but me and CB are having a crisis, a sexual crisis, as in it's very possible that I could be pregnant but we just can't shake off the feeling that the man is infertile so we don't know. Tonight I shall have a conversation with Beenie she is the expert on these matters, well on the morning after pill matter, anyways. I hate this fucking chair, it threw me off good and proper and I spilt a bit of coffee and dropped my first cheese/apricot jam sandwich onto the floor which nearly made me cry because I had taken a bite and it was so good...so I had to throw it out, I had to mop up the coffee and I had to rub my bruised arm. I mean, really why did it happen? Am I pregnant?  
No, really. Am I?  
Sorry I thought Paranoid humour would work...but somehow it just makes me feel worse. Sex was good though but it's ALWAYS good, I mean it's like..you have a guranteed great fuck. Ho-Hum. No really, it's more than that somehow, the whole "Love" thing makes it exciting each time. But god dammit did we have to not use a rubber? did he HAVE to...you know...oh fuck... let's see... I watched Down With Love Saturday night, and it sucked, heh, I just don't want to sound smug you see...But the film really was not...good. I mean Ewan was great to watch and so was Renee, whom you know I don't really mind....except I did mind her at the end of this film because I wanted to shoot her and the screenwriters for putting me through that fucked up ending that made no sense. I think Been put it best when she very loudly said "What?" during the so called climax of the flick. The crowd laughed more at what she said than the film itself. If Been's succint exclamation makes no sense listen to what Peter Traves from Rolling Stone said about it: 
"What starts as freshly spun cotton candy ends as something pink, sticky and indigestible. You leave the theater wanting to puke it up." 
Amen, bro.  
Did I mention Renee is going to play Janis Joplin? Ha. Fuck you Hollywood.

       Today I peed my pants. I didn't mean to, I just need to see a doctor. Well considering I'm back to smoking 1-3 cigarettes a day, it could be irritating my bladder. Fucking hell, why can't I be normal? Oh normality? Where are thou? Are you residing in the eyes of a plucked pierced and boobed tubed pink haired girl named Cindy? Har, Har. Anyways yesterday was great, me and CB went on a date to Burgerlicious where the retard waitress got my order wrong, she was cute, but fucking out of it. I told CB that she must've been on drugs the night before, because no-one could be that naturally spaced out. Speaking of spaced out... I am getting scared of blogger, it keeps eating my posts, which means I can't even look away from the page because usually when I do look away the post vanishes. I hate you Blogger and you little Save Your Post? box too... Back to the date! So me and CB walked around Newtown, he brought two books, and I was hoping he'll buy me something but he didn't. Speaking of the devil, he just came downstairs and told me off for writing about my irritable bladder. First of all, anyone with this very common problem will tell you, it's pretty much water, no smell, no colour, and it doesn't happen all the time...arch! listen to me, justifying myself. Fuck it. You guys don't want to hear it? Go read a blog that is all sugar and light with no fucking evil substance in it. A non smokers blog at the very least. Heh. 
I'm tired of cleaning the house, of doing all these things for the house and stuff, just tired of it. I do use my time productively so that's what counts. I was thinking ... how can I get more wood panels for paintings? I may have to talk to my mother soon, I like painting on wood, it's more easier for me than canvas...I'll write more in a little bit.

I say laughing passing her the roach, "Watch her smoke paper!" Been takes a drag and grimaces like a caricature 
"But it's so smooth!" she gasps.  
 
I called mother around 8AM, I had set the phone on alarm for that time and god dammit I had gone to lie for some sleep at 6:19AM, so you can imagine the state of my mushed up zombified brain. (more on that later) 
"Hello!?" my mother's usual paranoid tone to her greetings that usually border on the hysterical, always makes me think she is waiting for a phonecall that will tell her I or my sister have been raped, butchered and disembowel and our remains were found inside dead Lab Rats, well THAT voice was hindered with sleep, and insanely I remembered it was Saturday and I could've called her at 9AM.  
"MUM?" I yell, forgetting that CB is asleep and finding myself blearly looking at him as I stick out my tongue. 
"Danneth!? What is going on?" 
"I can't go to your house today because I found my ID and that's good because you don't have to fork out 40 bucks" I whisper like a raspy witch.  
"Oh okay, see you next week?" 
"Yeah sometimes next week. I'll call you" 
"Okay bye" 
"Have a good birthday!" 
"Okay bye bye". 
Do you realise how pathetic she sounded? but the thing is she sounded arrogant and important and I just sounded fucking tired. But that is exactly VERBATIM what we said, word for fucking word. I have to go now and watch CB play Resident Evil.

       It's been awhile, sorry for the lack of updates like you fiends care... Heh. Well one fine day awhile ago Rosco came over with his little satchel of expensive yet worth the dosh greenery and well time just seemed to lapse. Sorry about that. If you were at Been's page earlier you would've seen some pictures that I scrouged up from the bottom of the mank stained internet. Some of them are funny...I have a few more I will post at the bottom of this entry. I have been listening to a lot of old punk and stuff, and it didn't help that last night The Dandy Warhols were hosting  urlLink  Rage   ,which is an excellent show on Television, one which has been going on for ages. So my love for punk and alternative music has once again being sparked. Also  urlLink Ween  has a new album, called Quebec, if anyone wants to get me a great present, you know what that is! I have cable now, so listening to the music is a sintch, it's the not having enough money to buy the album that's killing me. That and the cigarettes. I just found the lighter inside a Happy Meal Box, do you know how disturbing that is? Well they were eating burgers here earlier which was kinda weird, I hate those burgers they can only be consumed when one is completly intoxicated. I've been listening to a lot of old music from Sonic Youth...listen to this man.. 
  She doesn't have nothing to do 
and the boys say: "hey Goo what's new?" 
My friend Goo just says: "Hey you"  
 
Heh, I always thought she said "Pee-ew" instead of "Hey you" which I thought was funnier, that was a song called, yep you guessed it "My Friend Goo" from the Goo album. Heh. Yesterday laundry, the day before that I think was Friday, well I went out during the day with CB who brought me lunch and Super Smash Bros, you know a GameCube game, and uh we came home to a terribly ill Beenie. She looked really pale and we thought she was going to die, I guess that's why I let her have a spittle bowl. I have been playing a lot of Smash Bros and CB has been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Which he reckons looks better than Zelda: Windwaker. Hah, whatever. Well gotta go, I'll leave you with another great lyric...snippet thing. 
"Don't cut the mind, don't chain the source   
The path of life's not easy to course, buddy  
Z.....O-L-O-F-T  
Z.....O-L-O-F-T

 - "Zoloft" - Ween - from their new album - "Quebec".   
Oh by the way the ween official page needs flash so you better get it, and a good computer, so if you don't have either. Get them. I really don't care how...

But his vocal delivery and lyrical depth I find to be lacking [and I am the target audience, by the way; I'm 16]. .... 
That's just amazing, the young actually accept brain damaging advertising, and know about 'target audiences'. Accepting the fact they are just little busy bee consuming. Oh well. Woke up today and realised that CB didn't take his lunch. Damn him. Lately I am feeling really weird in the emotions sense with him...I think he wants out, I just don't know, perhaps he is just feeling distant. Life can do that sometimes, drags you out and makes you feel like you haven't fit any of it's categories, but you know when I say Life, I mean you. I am downloading a lot of Eminem tracks, ah, yeah. He's pretty good, I shall go out and buy his albm right now! (slight paranoid look to the right..) I love Napster? Heh.

        urlLink US man survives drill through the head - smh.com.au 
I am too busy right now to post interesting mindblowing stuff, like my interview responses, but I *have* to read the paper and what I saw in this article..well one sentence struck home to me, as the nephew of this incredibly lucky man walked into the hospital room and saw the massacre a drill bit has done to his uncle's head he simply said "It didn't seem real - it seemed like a movie. I wasn't sure what to feel."  
Thank you Hollywood for the Sedatives, Hysteria/Panic/Emotions has no place here now.

The website is just so nice, amazing maybe? It doesn't matter. Been busy the last few days yaddah like everyone else is. The thought patterns that have come through my head have been amusing me, it all started with Colin Wilson's book  urlLink "A Plague of Murder"  which if you want a serial killer book that will entertain as well as horrify, well this is the book for you. My copy is falling apart so if you are out of Christmas options...which you won't be because you know exactly what to get me (hint: BOOZE) and ahem...well what was I talking about? Amusing thoughts, yes, well I think that motivation is a strange thing and only a few people trully possess ambition. I don't have it, I don't care for it. So I'm going to walk around the planet like a lump of crap then? Well you see we live in a world were the opportunities are endless, an age where information and contact come to us naturally like breathing...a conservative approach to life is long gone, it has to be, even people who want children should be thinking about a new way to raise them. This is a new time for new thoughts, no regrets, no rregressions, no feelings of inadequacy, all these mental blocks can be overcome, they will not tear into you making you their slave, weakness is refundable! It can be upgraded! Fear has it's own uninstall program! C.Wilson said in his book that these serial killers are men whose desires and negativity had married and exploded into uncontrollable urges that made them destroy. Anything negative that sits perfectly still festers and becomes cloudly and fear ridden. Nothing in this life is certain and joy can be taken from every simple thing and we must never forget it. I went to Newtown today to go to the bank, and as I'm walking in the street this lady stops me and asks me if I know about WWF, which for those of you living under the FOX network, means World Wildlife Fund not ...some wrestling shit... Anyways I said yeah and she told me she lives in the Northen Beaches and she cares about the environment but all the while she was looking at me like she thought I was a Newtown Bumrat. I have to go do some stuff... more later (Including a blog interview! how fun!)

       I don't know you know, sitting here while everyone is out with Roach boy. Sorry for not writing but I have been busy with life and all and trying to find some fucking direction and I just can't concentrate on writing about the path. Trust me it's so damn mundane you would feel the energy... god, it would be such a slap, trust me.  I feel like life is about to close in on me and there is a huge something waiting...and it only makes me want to live this life to it's fullest before it's too late, yet I am here in my safe fucking rut all the time...I feel like excitement is just playing a dirty joke on me. Is that crazy? Hahah Heh, it's 4AM and I'm talking to my stupid blog. Man I have never felt so sad in my whole life. So alone it actually inspired me to do a couple of really bad drawings, which I will spare you the viewings of and a poem which I could type out...and feeling lonely sucks, so I will probably type them out. Heh on you.  
Feeling lonely is almost as bad as....shit I don't know. You know what makes me laugh? How my sister could say that she has it tough with no self esteem....but she changes for her self esteem, her insecurity makes her active. She will always be creative and keep people around her. People make her forget. People just fucking remind me how out of this world ... how strange and how psycho I can truly be. Active? She has it made, I could lie here still for a million years in petrification that I will shatter. She changes, she knows what's going on. My self esteem just wants me rammed to the ground every step of the way and all I have is my convictions and my stubborness and fuck them if I change and fuck THEM for all going to Roach boy...oh boy..I wish you were here..I'm listening to this song by Pulp...it's called Babies..listen.."Well I guess it couldn't last too long.......... 
I came home one day and all her things were gone, I fell asleep inside. 
I never heard her come. And then she opened up her wardrobe and I had to get it on. 
Oh, listen we were on the bed when you came home, I heard you stop outside the door. 
I know you won't believe it's true, I only went with her 'cos she looks like you...my God! "
 
They are going to be smoking pot and drinking and having a merry old time and I am going to be sitting here. Bitter. Because I could try and try my damn hardest and I will never be part of that crowd, we the eccentrics are too weird and too political. I just get shit bored talking/slurring shit to other people. My pain is too fucking big to ignore, to sedate. I like to share, want some Pain with that? People just waste my precious time, I'm too fucking egocentric. But the real reason why I'm not going is that I just wouldn't have had any fun, I just don't 'hang' with metaphorical pests. Anyways remember the ocean of my mind? Well here is the teenagy angst ridden poem, hmm as T.M says in his lovely song "Here we go to another candle I know..." but I just want to post it. Fuck Thurston. Emotionally I'm 13.
 
   (In the Fucked up)  
It's not like I asked 
Such a moment waned 
lost in the fucked up 
It's not like I cared 
 
A needle climbing outside your chest 
claiming you were the moment 
the exclusive best 
 
And it's not like I loved you 
a Cry gone to waste 
in the fucked up 
Lay that to rest 
 
Maybe it's all the adoring 
bitterly bitterly fleeting 
shallow, not for me 
found it boring, oh so boring 
in this fuck up. 
 
 
Me and this world we have a love/hate relationship. I know Roach boy is CB's friend...I know that he deserves to go out but why does it feel like a betrayal when they all go and leave me here? I think I just need a cigaratte and shut the fuck up. I am not happy, so shoot me. It's a natural accurance for us here. In the Alienated.

I have been researching a lot of Latin American artists and musicians and I managed to translate a song by Carlos Puebla, a song dedicated to Che Guevara who as you know was a guerrilla from Cuba who helped Fidel Castro in the taking of Cuba in the 40's. He wasn't a butcher; he was a man who wanted the starvation and exploitation of his people to stop. You see ... I don't think Latin Americans knew how to be patronising and elitists before Western Europe raped them. But perhaps they were... I just like the story because it's visionary and they had the balls to do it, it cost Guevara to lose his life painfully, full of torture, but he gained the love and admiration of millions of people who fucking hate this dog eat dog system and who just want to live life unenslaved. This is the translation, you can find the spanish version  urlLink  here   and if you  urlLink  email me  , I can send you the mp3.  
 
 Hasta Siempre Che Guevara (Forever, Che Guevara)  
 
We learnt to love you 
From a stature history 
Where your solar bravery 
Put you close to death 
 
 Chorus 
Here, clarity resides 
in the amicable transparency 
of your dear presence 
Commandant Che Guevara  
 
Your glorious and powerful hand 
Shoots across history 
When all of Santa Clara 
Wakes up to see you 
 
(Chorus) 
 
You come in burning the breeze 
With suns of Spring 
To plant the flag 
With the light of your smile 
 
(Chorus) 
 
Your revolutionary love 
contributive for a new industry 
Where stability awaits 
Your liberating arm 
 
(Chorus) 
 
We will follow forwards 
We will follow you 
And together with Fidel we say to you 
"Forever, Commandant Che Guevara"

       It's one of those afternoons, just had a shower and I feel clean and yet somewhat tired. The car got fixed today but Been is no where to be seen...oh yeah it's father's day and I don't have a dad, which is kinda cool because I have to save up. I remember when my mother wanted me to get her a present on Father's day because as she put it, "I am both your mother and your father". Well..not quite. Remember how I was bitching about CB? I don't even know why I fucking do it, it's not evil, it's nothing, it's just my depression wanting to feel good instead of the perpetual bad. I'll join the right wing protestors for 5 minutes and say it was because I was listening to too much Eminem. Heh. CB brought me roses and cigarettes and a copy of book 8 of Preacher, and he said happy 11th month anniversary and I felt so bad for doubting him and immediatly felt relieved that I had cooked him dinner and washed his pants. LOL, I fucking need a job I'm turning into Barbie. But what else could I have done? I needed to do something, a relationship is a two way thing, and I spent all night scratching his back after sex while eating dark chocolate and reading Preacher. Oh and listening to Rage spew out Blondie track after Blondie track, which reminds me I have to go and check on a song...but before that a little update. I've been roaming the internet for art sites/design sites and have been inspired and I believe that we live in exciting times where the talented have so many options. Never settle for second rate, unless you want to be mediocre.

       Look, it's just that this month has been pretty bad to me, so bad that I had to be either stoned or obsessed with something else, just to seperate myself from myself. It was such an abhorrent month. So here I am in the process of being happy, or so i think, some kind of transformation in my path in life. It's strange what vegetables and fruits can do to the human psyche. Lately I have been listening to a lot of David Cassidy and to tell you the truth Dave just doesn't do it for me, I mean the songs are repetative enough to be considered jingles I guess, but they are not real music and Dave well let's just say I have seen better looking shag dogs. Anyways I am really stoned right now and just got of  urlLink this website   and want you to click on the REGGAE button, because that is what I am, a reggea lovin' punk.  
 
Quote  
D: "I can feel my eyes turning red" 
David Cassidy: "I think I love you..." 
Been: "I am so stoned...Ah.... I can feel the juices bubbling inside of me" (Maniacal laughter followed by eyes rolling in sockets) 
That was really fucked up guys sorry for writing that... And also I have been listening to a lot of Jack Johnson and can feel his sex appeal just fucking ooze out of those speakers. He insipres me to be a poet...hmm I just realised how cheesy that sounded. Almost as cheesy as that conversation me and Bri had earlier, where he was just coming from an OCD episode (for more information  urlLink click here)  and I was playing X-Men arcade. Anyways it was cheesy because we were talking about the emotional garbage, new emotional fucked up baggage that the new generation that is US in comparision to the older generation which fear and hate us for it. Anyways I'm rambling, I'm also really fucking sonted, I thinkthis shit is laced with CRACK or  
D: "Oh fuck what others drugs are they?" 
Been: "I don't know, Heroin? that is all the brain can tell us right now"  
D: (In deep thought) "No wait man...I think it was acid...yeah that this stuff is lacid with some great fuckin' acid!"

       Well second day of being lazy...second or second millionth? Seconds maybe....hmph. Oh yeah I have been searching the internet for sites to link to but all I get these days is The Sims or scary fucked up flash sites. I think Been is addicted to Fear, and maybe that's why she loves Raptors so much. But anyways this is gonna sound complicated but here goes, you must all know or sorta knew, that I was doing some volunteer type work right? As in I was going to curate a children's exhibition at the Rocks for free for a non-profit organization called "Kid's Earth Fund"? Well the guy that ran the joint was not my scene baby you know? He didn't really want my curating help, he just wanted physical labour. Fuck that. I clean this whole fucking house everyday and then I get stoned and have to chase Leprachauns or Elves everywhere on the Gamecube. That's fucking hard man. So I said fuck it. I'm going to paint again, but first I have to find me again. Where did I go? What a depressing question but it's what I'm feeling, where am I? The road ahead is exciting but fearful but I'm living it and I can't stop it and nor do I want to try. It's just so exhilirating that I feel like I'm not worth it. How fucked up, you know I wish I could kill that part of psychosis would just eridicate from my fucking mind. It's too cheesy and makes for bad writing. Ha. Today I heard a word said on TV that hadn't been said out loud in my earshot since year twelve english Shakepeare class...Glib...glib....glib...sounds cool huh?

On that same page I had done drawings everywhere, and I drew Gambit because he is the sexiest X-Men. By the way if you are in Australia on Saturday (i think) at 4:30AM they are going to be showing the animation series again! How awesome! Anyways I am going to include this drawing here.

        "The Hendersons will dance and sing... 
As Mr. Kite flys through  the ring ....don't be late!"  
This are some crazy times, we went up to the Erko pub and I overloaded on sticky pudding. I feel like a troll. I got some money from Been today and that was cool. So I kinda just went free with it for awhile, which is understandable cause these past couple of months have been very financially strange, I have developed an obsession (much more then before) with the Sims which includes "Paypal donations and subcriptions", I have gone broke, and I mean broke, the electricity bill was through the roof, it was insanity. Money was dissapearing like confetti.  
The girls are trashing the house it's like they can't handle it being clean. Fuck >:P  
I brought a pack of cigarettes today, I feel like one now. I have been playing this game called "Pikmin" on the Gamecube and let me tell you it's something else...those Japanese folk, god bless them and their fucked up obsession with small cute things. The love I feel for these little red/yellow/blue pikmin is much like the same love I have for making Jigglypuff taunt just so I can hear that little mouth squeak "Jigglypuff"..or something like that... yes.. Perhaps I am going mad? I am watching Queer Eye and Idol enough now to be calling their show title casually. That must mean I'm fucking insane.
But yeah, these days are just pushing me forward, like for example I am now addicted to Coke. Not just a mild addiction, this one does not let me sleep. I hate that foul dirt water....but I can't stop drinking it, no matter how much I abhor it. 
Now the girls are going to watch a Beatles documentary the scary one that says "Will Paul come back as Superman"..anyways i watched "Signs" and "The Ring" again today so now I am slightly disturbed. See ya!

        Interview Questions by dragon 
(drinking coffee)
 1) What word or saying do you use too much?   
Fuck. I say it something like 37 times a day. A phrase I say a lot is "that's crazy!" and more recently I've been saying "Good times...Good times..." in the nostalgic tone Jerri from 'Strangers with Candy' says it in. 
2)  If you were a fairy godmother for the world for a day, what three wishes would you grant and why?  
I would eradicate greed, we would all be enlightened to the point where we would not need to take from others for our own frivolous self. So capitalism would be abolished and it would be a great system were we were all emotionally ready to do work because it has to be done not because we need it to define who we are. We do not need elitism, where did people get off thinking they were king shit? No really, why do we feel the need to be validated at all times? I need this job to be successful so people will respect and admire me. Come on...as Bill would say...WALK THROUGH THE FUCKING DOOR....you are HOLDING US ALL UP. We are all the same species; we all are, to be constantly thinking that we have to be better than each other is futile and stupid. So I think I will grant everyone in the planet a powerful third eye. Evolution will start.. it will be great. Let the Aliens land! 
 3) What is the most important thing to you?   
To learn and to practise and to have discipline and to upmost and most importantly respect yourself. That's vital, one of the things that I dont get is that although I know those things are important to me....I just don't fucking practise making a practise of art. Because I don't have the discipline. So I hold something ...in this case..the discipline to practise daily..all the things you've learnt..but I'm always distracted by fun and diversion. So yeah..weird...at least I have the self respect thing down pat.  It's important in life to learn from your weaknesses and to get over them I guess, so it will always be a struggle to learn and overcome it. My friends and my mother/sister/cats/gamecube/only sachet of sugar left...are also important.  
 4) If you could meet any one real person, living or dead, who would it be and what would you talk about?  
I would love to talk to Bill Hicks. We would just have drinks and cigarettes and we would talk about the human condition and the power of will. I want to ask him what he thinks about the current state of politics in the world, about the film Donnie Darko and if he likes banana smoothies. Oh and we would talk about porn. For sure. Then sit in a field somewhere and stuff...I just hope he doesn't get sleazy on me Har. Har. Yeah like I'd turn fucking Bill Hicks   No I'm kidding I will never do it because it's absurd. He's dead and I don't fuck ashes...and uh...I have a boyfriend. 
 5) Suppose you could decide all the people in the world had to read one book ? which one and why?  
Easy '1984' and 'Animal Farm'. The more people who know about the "machine" the more people will leave it...to the day the motherfucking torturous thing will choke, splutter and end. Maybe then we can all go home or start over with a new attitude. Pretty fucking idealistic huh? Har. Har. But yeah..read the books...Orwell is fantastic.

       I am really tired, so very tired and all I did today was walk up the street turned left and ate a Lamb kebab. Pretty pathetic huh? My whole life is an eating exercise. On another note I managed to get some work experience which will start in 3 weeks. In the mean time I have to trek everyday to Bondi Junction and stay there 9-4pm for 3 fucking weeks and then start the work experience in Surry Hills. The Bondi Junction thing...is compulsory, I have to do it...I don't really want to explain it but let's just say that I have things I have to do in other to get paid and they don't stop for a very long time. But you never know I may turn into a 9 to 5 person after all, as in I may get a job out of this. I just want enough money to be horribly decadent and indulgent. That's not too much to ask now is it?

       "Yo dat shit is crazy.." I watched Idol today and I have a little secret, I have been watching it three times a week for at least 14 weeks...that's bad isn't it? But bad is me this year, so there you have it. I have a crush on Dicko, I think he my Australian/Brit hybrid version of Alan Rickman, a pudgier sexier version, because he's so much bitchier than Snape. Har, Har. I had a great Thursday, Bri came over with BEDan and a wagon full of refreshments. It was such a crazy night, we hopped into his car around midnight to a naughties trip to the Cross (we can't say but we were all very paranoid that we were there) and on the way there he was telling us how he didn't mind hanging out with us, sure he had to re-evaluate his principles and was not happy with the situation (about the drive people! catch up!) but you know Been and her persuasive power...she pushed him into it. Well not really...I think she just stared and it nearly broke Bri's mentality. She has a gift. She would tell you I probably persuaded Bri but she would be lying. So yeah Thursday was filled with Smash Bros Melee action, it was a lunatic battle in the end because both CB and BEDan were there and they were really tough...damn CB and his evasive run-away tactics...I tell ya sometimes I wish I was really in the game. Ha. That'll fuck him up. Actually I think it would fuck me up...so let's not go there any further. I was checking my bank account this morning at 10AM which translated to you people with jobs...it really means 5:45AM...yeah middle of my fucking night right? But you see last night I had this vision of me getting fat and gross and pregnant..and middle aged...and it was just horrible, I'm like...I'm 24 when did I turn 45? But that's monotomous lifestyle for you...you have to keep active and remember talking to people, and talking to your roommates in random conversation doesn't count...I could go on about the semantics about the importance of long conversations and actual contact with strange people...and how that can really affect who you are, but I won't. Let's just say that I have missed that about being social. I think I can explain it a lot better through this Sublime song:  
Picking up trash on the freeway 
Feeling depressed every day 
Leaving without making a sound 
Pickin up my dog up at the pound   
Gettin yelled at by my Dad   
Saying I'm happy when I'm not 
Finding roaches in the pot 
Ooh, all these things I do  
They're waiting for you    
 
I'm having a great night GUY WON, GUY WON GUY WON GUY WON!!! I can't believe Cosima pulled out! What a bitch of a larynx! How it fail us now!? Us? Well...I do represent Australia don't I? And I think it should have been a battle between Paulini and Guy...but alas I fucking failed myself when the whole of Australia (apart from everyone I know) voted for Shannon..I can't understand it...I can't understand a word the man is saying! Anyways I have to go...kisses to my fans I shall be back soon. Those interview answers are a-coming!

       I can't remember what we did last weekend...I know Bri was sick and that BEDan was over all the time...tomorrow is Beenies birthday party and it's going to be huge, a lot of people are going to be here and it's going to be fucking insane. I fear the cops, and if I don't write for another week you'd know. So how is the whole travelling to Bondi Junction for 5 days in the wee hours of the night (8:30AM) like? to go and sit in a room and be pressured to do telemarketing because they don't want to give me any money to live so they would rather sell my soul....it's so demorilising. That's it. And I had a big crying fit when I came home. On the upside I love travelling again, so it's all good. I won't telemarket, I would rather eat a big mac. Anyways gotta run

       School of Rock....That was what I had to sit through today and I was only able to do that because of Jack Black....man is that man sexy....sure he is a chubby little hairy man but you can overlook that so easily... he is a handsome devil, those eyes, that chin and that beard stubble - you cannot deny it. But was the movie good? And who is copying whose acting style? Joan or John? The Cusacks act so similar sometimes it fucking scares me. Is that really Joan Cusack, or John in drag? I don't know but that concept somewhat frightens me. The movie is PG, so yeah enough said yeah? There is no relevance here to our lives because we are poisoned beings...but for you wholesome people who like Van Halen...(and there are a lot of you!) go for it, go see it and have a smashing good time with ACDC and a lot...a lot of feel good rock anthems. I have been thinking about moving out, me and CB are getting a place of our own...I think our relationship needs that step. Who knows what....oh shit...I just remembered that I have to go to Mum's house tomorrow...I might go super early with CB ....yes....yes.... what good luck I remembered...hmm...well you see I have been thinking about moving out because I'm tired of partying...I need to get the visions down pat now...otherwise lose my sanity, so you know I have made some massive steps to put my life back on track. I'm telling you...that last week was crazy...me and CB broke up for 20 minutes...and in those 20 minutes we were the most miserable in our lives...sometimes I can the such a fool. I love Been a lot but I know that I have changed and I know her...life is just so fucking complicated. I know I already said that...

       Today was somewhat anti climatic... just another random day. Tomorrow I have to go and do a whole bunch of stuff...I'm going to vounteer for a Graphic Design position...should be enlightening if nothing else. Right now Dendy Mike is over and him and CB are watching I am Sam, which is a good 2 hours long and all I want to do is play Smash Bros, I'm also chain smoking again. Go figure, didn't I have a good health pep talk with myself the other day? Yeah I know, we all have those...the "Oh my god I am DISINIGRATING" talks, Har, Har. I like Dendy Mike he is a director and well.. he knows a lot about analysing films. I'm a little nervous about the whole... graphic design thing. What if I fuck up? But I need it so bad, I need to get the hell away from these addictions...you know the ones. I'm not going to repeat it...I guess you could say tomorrow is another day and that life is just a series of choices that you have the power to do. But me and will power we have been arch nemesis since I was a child. I feel like drinking sparklingwhite wine..and relacing in a hot sunny beach under a cool umbrella and salty sea breeze, doesn't that sound lovely? Or how about...sitting by a big comfy chair, reading a good book while snuggling next to a loved one.. hehe... man I've turned so disgustingly cliche! And it sounds like something purple bitch would say... man she is so fucking boring... I have given up reading her washed up live journal. I got a flash book and I should be studying for tomorrow....

       I just ate the most horrible plate of spagetti bolognaise I have ever had. It was horrible because it was just so bland and watery, watery spagetti? it's a world gone mad to quote Wurz. I ate in a soup kitchen although they call themselves " Salvation Canteen" (well thats what I'm caling them) and it is the worst place, I bet even Saddam who was stuck in a hole in the ground would go to the canteen and think...god dammit...so many unkempt homeless people licking plates clean for 3 bucks. CAPTURE ME NOW AMERICA. This canten in some salvation army hell hole in surry hills. I am no longer a citizen but a piece of unemployed trashed too poor to do anything. Why would anyone associate themselves to me? Isn't this talk pathetic? Yes, Yes it is, and I for one, have had it. This godam RESIGNATION that I am going to be stuck here for the rest of my natural life, sponging of friends and never really finding a place in this FUCKING society...I am so determined...right now...from this day forth I am going to be doing so much art I am going to be dreaming about it while I go to the toilet, it's going to be my godamn ticket OUT OF HERE. This is not where I belong, I belong in a small flat eating toast overlooking fucking PARIS....

Hi blog, I got up at noon, washed dishes, watched a bunch of porn trailers, filled out my MOB diary, went to the park with CB and ate dinner, had great talk with him...blah blah...  haven't smoked pot in awhile..really? How fascinating. Hopefully I never will again so that I can rest and regroup. Maybe become more interesting. I'm going to curl up now with CB and nap.

       What can you say about maybe’s? 
Does it make me sound like a girl 
Does it now? 
That hurts 
Dual thoughts in conquistador mode 
Tell me your intent that means something 
To someone 
Living alone in some area unknown 
Just maybe 
I can visit you in your sleepy age 
Powdered and faded 
With memories  
Blessed 
But then you’ll turn senile 
And I’m so wry wry wry 
That you’re mine 
Because I just don’t deserve you

       Is it possible to die from pizza? Maybe, but its a terrible brunch food...and it doesn't help that I'm chasing it down with a cigarette. Nice and healthy... I'm pretty much sick of it, pretty much sick of living this lifestyle but you know how you get with bad motivation thanks to evil addictive drugs. I should have caught a bus and gone veggie and fruit shopping and had healthy meals all day, I would've been glad for the exercise and fresh air, but when I woke up, bleeding because I'm a girl, and my head full of jigglypuff weed...well you know ...there was no way I would have done it...I'm too exhausted. So now CB and BEDan have gone to buy cat food and I am still here...with the fan blowing, uncomfortable because it's never comfortable to FUCKING BLEED...and because of this evil weather, I believe in hell. Because it must be slowly seeping through the floor...and here in Sydney? I would've thought the Devil would have more dibs in New York..urgh..the sun BURNS you here...BURNS...and air..is so...choking...Hey..in Britan the dude that sounds like Bono got the major votes for Idol...and in another country too...eh..he's pretty good. I wouldn't buy his album...because cheesy kareoke is not my thing, there is only ONE Bono, if you catch my drift. You should see Kelly Clarkson's face, what a dope, she actually expected to win, Har, Har. FOX News must be doing a good job of hiding the fact that everyone hates America to the Americans...for the correct reasons anyways. I don't hate Americans, don't get me wrong..but then again I don't vote for Idol. It's been a pretty bad day for me actually..now that I am winding up the post, really bummed out. I just want some Coke. Maybe because I haven't had any...I feel like shit..well...it will all end tomorrow. See you then.

       The first day of the year and I am already dreading paying bills, in fact I'm living in a sea of dread, so many things I have to face and they are going to be so bad...like for example, come mid January I am going to have to tell my mother why I didn't bother enrolling in University, I believe the University system here in Australia is absolute bollocks, and I know, I spent 5 years there. Pickled and patronized for it, which I find kinda funny, since most artist were addicts on some level. So no University for me, I want to get my graphic design certificate, and I want to enter galleries, but of course lately I have been too lazy to research and put forward my plans. 
 Hang on...the gamecube started hissing...I know it's hot, but it's not that fucking hot it's going to fry circuts...is it? I just turned it off...yes...the gamecube has started to come alive before my eyes...Futurama style..   Speaking of Futurama, I got the first season on DVD from CB! I was jolly for that, and other stuff I collected from everyone, it was a good Christmas. Although I think I can still taste turkey...blah. So yeah back on topic.. "Dread", another thing I dread is the thought of Roy being caught and having to go to trail...but the thing is, she is never going to be found...and if she is...it will be on a bigger charge or something, or at least that's what I'm hoping, so the trail will be quick and I won't have to spend so much looking at her, at me, at my past, I just don't want anymore part of crime...especially since watching 
 urlLink  Shawshank Redemption   which made me realise just how horrible prison could be, you see I had forgotten, I truly had, I haven't thought about prison for a long time, mainly because I haven't committed any crime, but the ever impeding collision course with Roy...well it scares me. It's going to need a lot of bravery...I wonder what year the red letter day will be...it's a long story behind why I'll have to go to trail when she is found and I don't really want to discuss it...but I feel the need to gather strength and hope that I will be redeemed of my past actions, I just want to put my past behind me, it's not a good past and I just want to be free of it. On another note, I'm pretty broke, I manage to splurge 50 dollars on Friday and I can't afford it but unfortunately for a little Taurean like me, life just isn't as nice without buying stuff...Har. Har. Wait..I will like to clarify something... I'm not in the wrong in the Roy case, it's just having to be a part of it, and to be reminded of who I hanged around with, and what that person did...it just sucks, I'll be the first to tell you...some people had great friends, and great moments when they were 18-19, all I had was drug binges, the princess highway and a lot of desperate dreams. I just don't want to be there again, surely you understand. So yeah that was my "dread" issue. Perhaps Fate, Chance and the ever elusive God will give me a break and take care of me this year, I have many people to take care of and love and well, I guess I need the hope that I won't be fucked over this year. Which you know...would suck.  
I guess I should give a little recap on last nights festivities...well I woke up, went downstairs, had a cigarette, had another cigarette, went out to buy eggs and bread with Been and the came home, all of a sudden I started feeling ill and by 3pm I had already vomited and was in the process of cold sweats and fever, all the while thinking, why on New Years Eve? I had a party to go to in Newtown, Sexy Bread will be there with all his Sexy friends and there would be music, drink and all around merriment, but I got sick and CB had to stay with me, so we celebrated it high and drunk on Absolut Vodka. He had to work today...just called me 5 minutes ago actually...he barely slept 2 hours. What a crazy nut. Anyways so on the stroke of midnight we kissed and it was nice. My new years resolution is to let change come and come for the better. Welcome change, that's my motto for the year. Everyone called just after midnight...so it wasn't too bad...it's just that I am still ill from yesterday and that sucks...so I guess I will write later. Happy New Year!

       This is so hard...had a cup of coke and toast with butter and honey for dinner because thats all we have in the house and now I feel sick. I have to go wash my hands. No cigarettes .... Vixs, Bangs and Ojays were here but they are going to a gig to see Sexy Bread play around town somewhere and they didn't offer... Vixs rolled her eyes when I was talking about how hard it is for me, mentally and physically to keep smoking, and Ojays and Bangs were great...it's going a little easy with their support, a little hard considering there is a cone left and a half empty packet of Champion (which is a tabacco brand, kinda smells like rum and very shaggy) oh and another packet of Peter Styvensons, which is my favorite brand... *sigh* 
I just got off the phone with Bri and he said too much purity will kill you just as much as too much toxicity, so I've decided to set myself goals. Ready? 
1. No more cones. EVER. If I ever was to indulge... it would be in joint form and after one year of NO SMOKING pot. And it will never again be in this house. It never be everyday. It will never be every month. It will be a once off thing...maybe it's a party and it's the end of the world....thing....In other words...Never. Actually, yeah never. Today is the 8th of January...the day of oath. No more pot for me. 
 
2. I am going to quit weed now and quit smoking on the 23rd of April 2004. But before then I am going to wean myself. 

Let's see after one year how I'll go...hmm...well I just talked to CB who is going to score tonight and who predictable said that I can't blame pot for the state of the house or the people in it....so I am going to be fucking strong tonight... I was going to ask him to get me a packet of cigarettes but I kinda freaked out and never asked him. Should I call him back I wonder... ah I don't have money for cigarettes...so whatever...it's all for the best. Help me stay strong! :)

       "I stopped painting in 1990 at the peak of my success just to deny people my beautiful paintings. And I did it out of spite." - Vincent Gallo 
What a liar and a sensationalist...totally egotistical and self deserving...what a great quote. You just can't help but like an Aries. 
 
Sittin' in the evening sun  
And watching the same birds passing by  
Sittin' and wondering  
And waiting for the time for me to fly  
 
And I try  
I said I try  
Good Lord I try  
I really try try try  
 
So long and I just find  
It was just a waste of time  
So long and I just find  
I been been wasting all my time  
 
I've got to pick myself up...
 
It's such a cliche isn't it? But Peter Tosh somehow helped me see something... that I haven't been true to myself...I've avoided facing myself for so long....and perhaps thats a huge mistake...and maybe if I hadn't lied to myself...or cut myself short by going for the easiest cruise....I know I was born to work and to listen...yet all I've done is sit very still and crouched with my past....paused for 7 years....3 before those were weed in moderation.  So I guess they don't count. Wow...and all this time I was so anti denial...and no one asked why...I hate denial..because I know how easy it is...how damaging it is...and I know it first hand. It's a hard blow to take when you realise that you haven't listened to yourself ...you just took lead from others...not because you didnt have a voice...but because you had nothing else better to do that day and you just wanted to be around people. Laid back...cruise like person...tomboyish.. I don't care for clothes...not really...damn weird...whatever. All I know is that I'm a person of excess...and the excess is too hard to maintain anymore. So no more of that. We shall see if I'm strong tonight.

       I'm pretty sad today, looked at my coke gut for the first time with no sense of denial and I just got depressed. I've had a lifetime of indulgences and in the end run...look at me. I am not really free now am I? I used to think that being out of control is where real life lies...but essentially I am a boring person when it comes to living. Abstract worlds and observations doesn't really mix with cute rock star boys and whoring...which to a lot of girls...is "living it up...living it wild". I am not really active...my body is sluggish and poisoned. I don't need a lot of friends, the ones I have now are enough...I prefer long moments of solitude though...I like my moments alone. I like a clean house and order...my stomach last night was in gastritis hell from all the bongs I've pulled the past week...I sure am different. I don't want to live like this and I don't care if it's not cool. There are roaches everywhere...the piles of garbage stinking the place out...the constant fleas...the fact everyone is so fucking lazy (me included) to pick up after themselves... 
I am so tired...and so sad...because I don't want to live here anymore. And everyone here blames me..."If it bothers you...do something about it". After the 500 millionth time of cleaning up after them...that call gets old real fucking fast. Sure they help clean...once a week...twice a week...sometimes three times a week (I don't really recall this...but Been swears she cleans three times a week...I guess I'm only here for the first 1-2 times, and then there is CB who cleans up maybe once a month if we are lucky). Everyday something needs to be done... like the laundry...the carpets...the garbage...the bills...the bathrooms...grocery shopping...rent....the kitchen and the lounge room...which I do everyday....the floors are currently covered in acrylic paint...the smell of stale smoke and Milo stained cups lie everywhere....it's so fucking dirty. I decided last night to end my love affair with weed...because...the honeymoon is over. It’s been over for a long time. She wants me to put her above myself...my friends...my responsibilities...my life...she is now wanting control... like the demonic man-made stereotype of the crazy housewife...and well that's scary, because I've come to realise...weed is living my life for me...I have no control...and yet...I feel like I'm not really living at all. Making constant mistakes...tripping over life...how is that living your life? How is it? I don't want to fly up the norm...I don't want a guideline that says THIS IS HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE. I am a born creator...I was born to create art...to observe and to paint and to write and to say from various people and situations and issues in this world...I was meant to be vehicle for life...to express it someway...from ME. But I don't even paint anymore...too much pressure...not enough motivation...why? Because I smoke dope, and I would rather smoke dope than paint. I’m not in denial, I can say it with a straight face, motivation whatever little of it I had, all my determination…is gone. All that is left now is the desire to smoke weed, to smoke cigarettes, to get drunk, to lie in filth…to not live. Some people never get addicted to it...I was like that when I first started until recently...when I was around 21 that’s when it got ugly....when I first started....it was an occasional thing....and when moderation kisses your life you can do anything....and be satisfied...but then I started to get addicted...and my self perception got really warped. I have never really liked myself...I always thought I was a failure...my sister says my mother loves her best...and sometimes I think it's true...I get upset over little things and drown myself in future predicted dooms. I don't take care of myself...I sometimes wonder why CB loves me in the first place. All these things...I've had them all my life...I hated school because all I wanted to learn was how things worked and how they affected people...not how to listen to someone's experiences or their shortcuts or notations...I didn’t want thousands of maths problems...and then to be left alone to do them....teachers who were sick of their job and so took it out on the kids...with exasperation, short temper and snide remarks. Too fucking sensitive...that's my problem...so I take drugs. No-one really understands me you know...because no one had truly lived my life, not even me. I've just followed the easiest way to remain invisible....I can't forget a lot of old hurts...and new hurts...like the accusation that I am 2 dimensional and that all I talk about is CB...boring...that I don't give enough attention to everyone...only to CB...that I am co dependant on a relationship...that I have turned into everything I despise in that sense...what can I do? I can deny it...because it's obviously not the truth...but what’s the point? People will always see me as they want to see me...and will always want for me to validate them....I never really understood validation...when I was a kid my mother remarked how fat I was...like a sausage...she said...when I couldn't fit into a dress...are you like a monkey mum? Too stupid to realise I’m a human being not a monkey like you? I don't look around...see what the majority is...and then point and scorn at those who are different. Because you can't buy the latest overpriced pieces of crap that were made by a multi million dollar company that paid 2 cents per garment so they could sell it to you for 70 bucks...well...fuck it... Things like that just anger and hurt you when you're young. And yeah I saw the world like that at a young age because it helps to be inquisitive. I want to be loved...and to love someone....when I love my friends...I give them everything I can...and lately that’s not enough for people like Been or my sister. They want more, for me to be like them...to go out and get trashed and to "live life..." Not to be stuck inside playing the game cube and reading on the internet. They think I'm just being sad...and pathetic. No one wants to hang around someone pathetic...yet they do. But these days I don't say anything...because I don't feel that they love me...they are just trying to fit me into their life...and it's a life that I've already lived. So, whatever makes them happy.
I'm an artist for fucksake...and I have many, many, many things I want to paint and draw in my mind...all I need is some love from me to me...that’s why I have to stop doing drugs. I am tired of hating myself...of thinking it's always my fault...that I’m a nerd...a loser...someone who needs to be killed...because society can't find a place for me. Is that fair? People are just so fucking self centred...they don't know or even think for one minute...that some people....just march to a different tune...that we have a perception on the world that doesn't revolve wasting 100 dollars on booze so that by the end of the night some human contact can be achieved through slurs and heavy petting. That's what's life's about! No it's not. Not for me, I tried it, and it was miserable times...miserable dirty...trodden down times... I don't want to live my life that way and I haven't wanted to live it like that since I was 17. Yet from 17-24 all I did was self destructive, I thought...maybe that's living life. You know, I think that it wasn't all bad. After all CB is named Cigarette Boy because we often went on cigarette breaks together at work, and that's how I assume he knew I liked him, although cigarettes and booze were never really taken out of control...and Been...ah Been who I know is just trapped in this drug hell almost as badly as I am...I know she wants more out of life too...it's just too confusing sometimes...and me and her have had some self destructive bonding times...but I cherish the times when we have gone to museums and art shows...and when we have painted and drawn together much more than the countless of times getting wasted....Cigarette smoke coats the very air I'm breathing now...and it's choking me....and I haven't smoked one all day. That's how dirty this house is. I'm tired now, but feeling a little better. I feel the urgency to move on. To cleanse and to be a better person. To look for a nice little flat and to resort to my world of abstraction. Because that's when I am free...and happy. When I am looking at the world from an artistic view....a clean view...with no obstructions...no weighed down...no fucking drugs. It's so hard you know to get off them especially when people say..."It's not pot's fault because I don’t feel like that...it's obviously you." Of course it's me...me and a long time on Mary Jane...a looong 10 years (on and off). Don't tell me it's only my fault...because it makes me think that I can't handle marijuana and that I’m the weak one...the loser one that can't hold pot. Oh no...It’s a fucking DRUG...and everyone has a limit. You think your personality is under control under pot? That you don't sometimes freak out and demand attention, sometimes funk out for months...sometimes sit there in your own filth...? Then you are not addicted to drugs, you're a social fucking smoker. Come back to me when you've developed an addiction. And pot smoking is not even a horrible addiction, there are worse. I just took it so far it stretched the inside of my soul…inside out…and put me on emotional pause.  Emotionally I’m still 17…can’t you tell?  
So what’s the plan? A couple more weeks doing the work I’m doing so I can get my 800 credit to go and do an illustration/pre press design course....get a job....more months to earn a grand...and then I'm out of here. Till then I have to grit my teeth and bear it, to clean Turkish bread out of drains, to sweep roaches from pots, and to spray fruit flies from the cupboards. To go upstairs when weed is smoked and to be a bigger person not to feel left out…to actually want to live…it’s nice…and it’s a dim cry in my mind…sometimes I get scared that that cry to be healthy and to take care of me…to learn from life instead of getting wrapped up in silly addictions…. It would be nice if I didn't have to deal with this shit though...it would be ...so fucking nice.

       Sorry about the ugliness of my blog...with all the quizzes and all the bad graphics. Ergh. I am currently getting absorbed in Flash so for now no Dreamweaver, the irony is that I am doing HTML programming at work, so it's like, what the fuck? Speaking about fuck...I was recently at this blog, I just spent half an hour looking for the blasted thing. It was written by girl who couldn't spell and  who had some real bad emotional wiring...let's see, she was complaining about how her boyfriend cheats on her, beats her, calls her just to manipulate her...he sounds like such a "real man" doesn't he? eh...anyways she says..Oh god this pain, it hurts so much...I just want him here..so that I don't have to be in so much pain" (this is not 100% accurate, it's strictly paraphrasing. It's the best I could in remembering it without a mental convulsion...) And anyways, it was just so fucking whacked man! It's nonsense, it's noise. The girl doesn't deserve to live, she deserves for someone to pry her fucking third eye WIDE OPEN. He caused the pain...eh...you want him ..."around"...to STOP the pain? It's just not strong in the logic department now is it? 
Yeah what an ugly episode. So now I will tell you about my day: I nourished myself with wholemeal and oat biscuts washed down with citrus absolut vodka and orange juice, whilst washing clothes and wearing black loungerie - oh and around 1:30pm, CB came down and we smoked copious amounts of drugs whilst making out and playing Mario Kart. Then after a couple of hours BEDan came over with coke and tomato sauce and we feasted on wedges and chocolate chip cookies, and I think I had a shot of baileys and a cigarette whilst changing clothes and playing Smash Bros. It was a nothing day basically..which brings me to my last words... 
  Quote of the Day  
 CB:  "I haven't had a Day of *bleep* for two weeks!" 
 Been and Vixs:  "We haven't had a Day of *bling* or day of *blonk* in months!" 
 D: "Everyday is D-Day!"

I hate Bush...and it's not a blasé kind of hate, you know, go with the crowd hate...I've been hating that piece of shit since the elections between him and Al Gore. Why? Because he's a republican, a greedy lying mudering thief... I judged him right, he is the fruits of his Satanic father's loins...fucking hypocrites. Grr. I have just been to  urlLink  this site   and sometimes... my hate can be fueled :P

       I'm really sorry I have left it this long to post...it's just that I have truly been enjoying life. Yeah I know, what the fuck? Watched Dead Poets Society 4 times this week just to help me cope.. I think it is fitting to write the quote which has helped the most, so here it is:  
We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman,  
 "O me! O life! 
Of the questions of these recurring 
Of the endless trains of the faithless 
Of cities filled with the foolish 
What good amid these O me, O life? 
 
Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and  identity ; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.  That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?  " - Mr Keating (Robin Williams). 
I know that must cheesy to some...but for me...it was a revelation...just to remember why I am here, why I enjoyed that movie, why I must go on. Been said that she is enjoying her pause ...but that pause nearly killed who I am. Wait up, I should explain, for me...the drug was an emotional pause, a life pause, where I put everything on hold including who I was...and I was silently suffering. Some people are filled with demons that they like to shut up...and they succeed...but as for me...my demons just got louder, got more smart and haunted me in my subconscious. I had a really emotional soul wrenching cry, and it shook something inside me, and it shook it out. What is improvement? What is moving on with your life? Who has the right answers? Wel I don't believe in that...I don't believe that is the right perception, for me it's a lot more personal than that...I believe in my heart and what my heart needs to be happy is to be free, and too be artistic and to love, not only those around me, but myself too. Because I have the right to be strong and the right to say No, and the right to defend those whom I love. Now I'm getting all poetic.. har, har. Vixs and Been just came home from going to a party and Vixs wrote a poem...which I would love to publish! So here it is:  
 Ode to Ojays  
O, Ojays! Where did you go? 
Are you using a pay phone? 
Oh yes! Please come back! 
Tell me your secrets of this life 
Ojays! Find forty cents 
If you find a dollar  
we could talk for longer  
O Ojays! PLease believe me 
Your calls make me smile 
I have to go and light some incense because they are smoking pot again, Chow! (Yes it's fucking hard to quit...but you know what? I don't miss it, I miss smoking it...sure...but not being stoned. Odd)

       Funny Blog Moments #1:

"B mag have just sent out an e-mail asking for people to call if they would like free consmetic surgery and the chance to be a star. I'm guessing it's something along the lines of that American "Extreme Makeover" show. And you know what? I'm actually going to call the number. I'm going to investigate getting them to do my breasts. Really the money was what was putting me off anyway...so when we take that out of the equation...there's no harm in calling them. Think of it more about empowerment and controlling your own destiny than giving in to society's ideals of beauty. "

Yeah because I have tits, I feel empowered. What a fucking loser. Har, Har. When are people going to realise that every perception in your life is mental and not physical? If you hate yourself, turn thin and big breasted in one day, you are going to be given such an ego boost that you will turn into an over compensating fucker. You are a sheep...such a sheep, claiming to be one of a kind. 
Ahem 
"What do you mean you won't love me? Because I'm a neurotic clingy drama queen that likes to stalk and cry when you say you can't love me? *tears* But I have big tits!!! I have BIG TITS!!!" 
Ahem... 
Everyone will know..everyone will know, that you got a boob job. And that you caved in. How can you be fucking credible if you gave in? You swallowed the lie, like hot sticky cum from Satan's pecker. You DID give in to society's ideal of beauty, stop being such a fucking hypocrite. I must stop reading her blog!

       Addicted to watermelon? Man sorry for being so airy last time...Anyways just one note:
 
I like it how I woke up all misty eyed..nearly walked into the shower door because I thought CB had opened it for me...and when I got in he kissed my shoulder. 
 
I also like the fact I didn't have to go to work today :)

       Well what a day, woke up feeling all sticky, because the humidity in this city is threatening to swallow my very being. All tired and shit...lazy because of the weather, put some sheets to wash and then I stupidly walk out the door to go watch "Cheaper by the Dozen". Do you know what a big mistake that was? Sure I got an ice cream treat and air conditioning but..Steve Martin?? He doesn't have the sperm capacity to father 12 children..there is a medical reason why he's got white hair...(he's been grey/white since the late 70's, there is something in his body that is keeping him from ageing past 50. I believe he is really 187 years old) When me and Been walked out we realised that it had been raining...so our sheets are wet. Yeah, what a fucking catastrophe! But you know...sleeping on a bare matress in sticky gross weather..with someone who is a grumpyguts (you know CB...what a grumpyguts..) it's just a living hell.  
Hmm... I need to see a doctor, my body is throwing out everything toxic and it's not pretty. One cigarette today and perhaps I'll have one much later but there is no rush. CB is sick and not smoking (or so he says) and so is Been. Is this a health kick? A lot of people have been going on some crazy health kick..it's insane. Why is that? For me, it's because I feel like I've abused myself enough. Let's go see the world from a different angle. I was living a rock star's DREAM lifestyle since I was 14. I'm 24. Let's try something else like... an artistic career. Hmm... sounds funky no? I'm a woman of extremes, so shoot me. I want to feel good. And since I really can see this world exploding into a war in the next 10 years...why not be prepared for it? I just did an extensive round of pilates and I feel great! I am addicted to watermelon. It's all good! Anyways I'm a little tired...see you all later.

       So at first there was sadness...and sadness came in waves, where I would sit and cry at the poor little yearning soul that couldn't so called "fly" to be "free" to fit all those clichés because in the end, it boiled down to this....what childhood? I fucking had none. So yeah, that was overwhelming and it forced me into this fucking funk that I hated and thankfully only lasted two days. Now it's the anger, anger, anger, anger, anger and I have no idea where it's coming from. I hate my life; I think this house is a fucking sham. I hate everything and I don't know why. Some could tell you that it's just anger about something that happened ages ago that somehow manifested itself into a competition inside my head. Let's see who fucking breaks. Let it break! Let it just explode into my head NOW. Instead of letting my anger hurt the people around me. Let these chemicals just settle down...sometimes I think...I want to die of cancer. I want to be lying in a hospital room somewhere, mentally retarded, alone and addicted. I want my last friend sitting beside me to be marijuana. I want it to be here with me, so i could collect drug fucked friends, be on the benefit forever, and do NOTHING WITH MY LIFE. I want to sit still and stay emotionally stunted, I don't want to grow up...but then I think of those last moments before I die...what will I think? What opportunities in life would I gain from such a life? I would be such a bitch...and sometimes I want to be. Right now I want to do something...like scream...OH FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't see the world of a stoner anymore, that world where it's all groovy and nothing matters. I sometimes want to go back there so bad, because everyone I love is a constant visitor. Why did I quit!? Nothing in my life apart from a clean house and more chores... I have quit pot and made myself chief fucking cleaner! Is that fair! Everyone here is living such a fine life of work and getting stoned and they are in such equilibrium! Sure they take everything fucking personally and bicker and bitch, so what? SO WHAT if I can see more clearly, this world is such SHIT. I read somewhere that American and Australian troops are going to be training together, building missiles together, fuelling the military and leaving people starving...AGAIN. How many empty bellies do they want? How many torn limbs amongst shrapnel and debris do they want? Another thing...amongst other things...and the fact that I still suck at Smash Bros doesn't help. Right now I want to go upstairs and go to sleep but I know I will just lie there and lie there and wonder what they are doing and it will piss me off, because my lovely paranoia (which is still very much alive) will keep me awake. I hate my anger; I wish I could just let it go. The metaphor that set me off is that I know CB is happy...and I can't share in that happiness. I can't. I wish I could go sit down and fucking cave in, but for what? For more guilt? Yeah that sounds like a good time. Hrmph.

       It's been an interesting week....incredibly long... I am worried about CB. I want to know what is truly bugging him...and I hope with all my heart it's because he is sick. He has been very tempermental and he was such an ogre last night...but in the wee hours of the day he was alright... we were up all night reading people's stupid comments on  urlLink  this site  . I don't know.. you know when you are worried about something but you don't know exactly what? I am so scared that CB is going to leave me...but why? I guess it's because I haven't felt together...I'm going for a job soon...man I feel so restless and unsatisfied with this life. When I say that aloud I know that I still love him you know? I really do, and I know he really loves me...but something unsatisfying is still there...I don't want to be stuck anymore, I want to do my own thing. Perhaps because I haven't realised my dream of being an artist...that's probably it. I should stop wasting time and grab some motivation. Fuck it. Let's go! :)

       This is the first post I will eh...post...using this really cheesy design outlook. Why did I choose it if I think it's so cheesy? I don't know, I looked at the chick with the Huh? Cloud over her head and I went yep. I am one of the Uncertain. It's late and I have sooo much shit to do tomorrow, but do you think that I can comprehend responsible? That I am capable of commitment and dedication? Okay. So maybe yes...but not tomorrow...not with 2 hours sleep...I just can't face that woman that early...perhaps I can call in...yes..yes. Okay you are going to witness what I'm going to say...as the plans hatch. I will wake up at 9AM and call the office (shit what's the number?? Perhaps I won't call...no, no I will find the number that's why I'm getting up early!) I'll call her and say "I have an important application that just came my way Cram, I will give you a copy of the letter when I see you on Tuesday, trust me, I'm going to have to spend a couple of hours on this." Man that sounds flimsy, you know she is going to think..weell...why don't you come on by later? Or do it in the office? Fuck. What do I say to that? That's crazy talk... Okay I got it. I will tell her on Tuesday while giving her a copy of the application that one of my friends called me that morning for a job application, it's a really good one and I had to chase up a couple of references and  type up the cover letter all day... if you want proof...here are copies of everything..etc..etc" She will have to write that down on the job thingy...I won't get busted for taking it easy...and I can go back to bed and wake up at 1pm, fuck CB, then eat some toast, go to Newtown, print my stupid resume out (again..who the hell gobbled up the ink? I printed out maybe 20 sheets...at most...come on! I want answers!) and then pop it in my envelope, send it off, go to Redfern...go to The Most Depressing Place on Earth, and then kaboom. Day ends around 4pm, I go back home, collapse, then wake up again to play Windwaker for 10 hours ... till I feel guilty and do some more html/graphics. Does that sound like a good plan? Yep. I'm pretty darn proud. One time Rawdy (his name changed...I forgot what I originally called him) once said to me "Dee...I would love to put you and George [Castanza] in a room together...I would make bets to see who would come out alive..." 
 
P.S: Please note that all links and relevant pages will be added in a couple of hours if my bum decides to wake up from it's numbed state.

       Last night Been and Vixs...well...this morning? They left for their holiday with a bang...Been tells me ,Vixs was still drunk, and drunkly grabbed the hair mousse thinking it was the mobile, and she thought she was calling Ojays, when in fact she was spraying her hair... mouth...nose.. Har. She was just totally out of it. Trashbag.  
Anyways I feel the need to be honest, and say that I'm trying to reach a compromise in my life. With drugs, with everything. It seems foolish to say that considering that I went to a party last Wednesday night and consumed "White Snake", anybody know what that is boys and girls? Well let's just say that you don't want to know...and gained consciousness...well..now? right now? I think it's slightly wearing off. Man it was one of those indulgent Fear and Loathing moments...yet so functional...I have a hair appointment scheduled, a Valentines Day gift picked out, Rent none owning, and I have no bills till after Valentines Day. Sure I've only slept two hours, missed on seeing BEDan off and played Zelda: The Windwaker straight...for 10 hours..trying to get fucking figurines... yet the living room is clean, my painting supplies are ordered, and I'm only smoking 3-4 cigarettes a day..  
What's going on? I have a cover sheet to write tomorrow, laundry, I have CB who is home sick till Tuesday, and I have a whole day scheduled with my mother on Monday! Do I want to be healthy? YES, Yes I do, and perhaps in this time that the girls are away I can truly indulge in that. Tomorrow is the start of the Christian week, perhaps I will eat fruit and not spend a whole 7 hour span of time making two redskins last whilst drowning the hunger with Diet Coke....man my lifestyle has to stop...but it's damn amusing! me and CB are fine...he is back to his beautiful self...he was sorely missed. We has breakfast at 7am, I had bacon and eggs with fluffy wholegrain bread and nothing else..and a big cup of coffee that the stupid fucking bitch of whore waitress forgot to give me. Me and and an impatient CB walking the streets of Erko with my lips stuck to a foam cup. So right now I am going to have a shower, fall into a deep sleep in my freshly washed sheets and dream..... I have to stop putting things off. I *Need* to finish learning flash!

        Tuesday : What can I say, it was exhausting, I brought CB's Valentine Day's present (It's so groovy...I'm going to scan it after he opens it to show you!) and I watched "Along Came Polly". I couldn't get into my local pub because of the fucking NO ID situation and uh... what's my thoughts on it? It was 90% humidity...I had no feelings...as soon as I had them they were sweated out of me. Been and I had a great time in the city though, it was cool, so I was happy about that, that and the constant catch ups I had seeing all my old friends and stuff. Sammy and Kella hooked up...crazy..
 TODAY:  Watched "Die Mommie Die" which was an excellent film, I really enjoyed it, and if you love old cinema and drag queens...WATCH IT...apart from that..well I came down stairs and had to wash a SLUG out of a CUP full of SOUR MILK...can you imagine the smell? on a humid day? I fucking hate it. I hate cleaning. I'm tired now. 
You what really ticks me off? CB never offers me weed...I mean he NEVER does... I always have to ask...why is that? Is it because he doesn't want me to do it? Then why does he do it? He always asks Been or Vixs if they want one...why does he ask them? I don't get it...and lately it's been giving me the shits. Maybe it's because we are so close and stuff it's like...I don't know. I have to tell him that for some neurotic reason I hate it when he doesn't offer me something but offers the girls something... it hurts my feelings. Anyways enjoy the fuck me candy heart...I'm addicted to these stupid quizzes...blah

       Monday: What a crazy night.. I mean day... I mean whatever the hell today was. I got attacked by a moth, spider, slug and I found a roach nest... it was the day that I went to Ikea and The Worst Place on Earth on the same day, sounds adventurous and dangerous and gross all at the same time doesn't it? It feels so familiar... like...as each day goes by... I feel like I am turning into Link, as this house...is more each day...turning into a swamp....
Humidity....you fucking suck, the lowest of the all the weather conditions...the ultimate Judas Iscariot....we HATE YOU.
I had plastic for dinner (2 slices of Dominos Pizza), I vacummed the carpet stairs and overdosed on Coke (a Cola!). I was sugar rushing so bad I actually did some oil paint pigment/constancy test today...whoa...I fucking work now?
Crazy day... Been freaked out in Ikea gasping in a high pitched voice at a tiny newborn baby. She turns to me and wails "Deeee I want a babyy"  
"Don't look at me sunshine, I can't help you". 
In the car on the way home FM2000 says to Been "The last time we fixed your garden was last semester" 
Been simpers: "Oh yeah, that semester...when you did the garden and all my assignments.....but I love you for it..I really do..." 
and I say "Yeah, but is it enough?" 
CB was delayed in the city due to City Rail's incompetence. May they burn baby burn. He didn't get my cock joke, but whatever. I'm now a pro at fellatio, or so I've been told.

       Okay yesterday was too painful to sit down and recanter...so I'm sorry. I cannot tell you the happenings of Saturday apart from the fact that I saw Jeepers Creeps 2, CB gave it a mediocre 6/10, to which I concur. The *snicker* actors in that movie deserve to be stipped, gagged and thrown off the Hollywood sign into certain death. You think that's a bit harsh? You haven't seen the movie then. Okay woke up today and thought... why is is so fucking hot? you can melt skin at this temperature, it's sticky, stuffy, horrible...evil...you name it. I think I might do a chapter of Flash today but I am having a predicament (any males reading this...stop right here, it doesn't concern you). 
I'm being visited by the "Crimson Wave" and am now down to my last tampon. It's too hot to go walking, it's also too hot to remain without a shower.. WHY OH WHY did I put it on when I woke up?? It's lame, stupid and dumb. I had 3 showers before finally going to bed last night.. I hate this fucking weather. I HATE this fucking weather. Sun die die die die.

       Wow, too much chicken macaroni. Actually these days, any food is too much food. I am just sick of savory...why can't I only eat sweet things? Like fruit....Calippo's... and Coke. Surely my teeth turning into black and falling off (see Quote of the Day below post) wouldn't be too bad...hmm but then again I don't want to look like the NightStalker or anything. Went to a job interview today, hopefully I was pleasant and that they liked me. Because once I start showing my true colours at work, by then they have to catch me doing something pretty bad to fire me. Har.  I wouldn't mind working there... I am not exactly going to disclose the whereabouts of my new workplace *if* I get the job, because I'm too fucking paranoid to jinx it. I want it really bad. But you know... fuck. I hate that feeling where you want to let yourself not get your hopes up but you can't help it.. I hate that! But.. I *really* want this job.  
Some guy came over today, he works for Integral Energy which is this big ass energy company whom is fighting Energy Australia in the "Energy Wars"...hmmm.. anyways he pretty much convinced me to leave my Energy Whore and go for his one...well I will because Integral uses a green power supply wich is environmentally friendly and because they are cheap. Cheap...er.... 
He was somewhat strange, the salesman...I don't know I kinda felt sorry for him, although at one stage I thought he was going to come out and produce a gun...demand to take my beloved Gamecube...he was that kinda guy. Anyways I am so fucking bored. Check out the Quiz too.

       I can't believe the internet terrorists!! They have done something to this computer I just know it. I have this crazy plan though that when I finish my mother's comissioned painting I am going to buy a big ass hard drive and start a new... even if it takes NIGHTS to complete. I need fucking order. I believe that I am turning into those anal organising types, which is funny since I used to snort speed. Anyways back on track, today I woke up with an upset stomach that set me way back in the chores department... I just don't have the passion to work in futile hope in this place... I just can't do it every day, I need a fucking life. I watched Sex and the City tonight, and I was highly amused by the whole "Sex" part of it. I like sex, and I am highly realistic on what sex is and what it isn't. Sex is not love, and it's not an indication that you are in love, or that you have fallen out of love.  Sex is just a basic human need to get off, it's a cocktail of hormones and affection. You would love for the person that you are with is someone you like, because sex with affection means no barries, it means freedom. Gee I sound like I should be writing for a column in New York doesn't it? All I need is the horse face. I ate too much yesterday and I know that's probably why I got the bug, I just fel nauseous and vomited a little in the morning, when I told the others Vicki immediatly and deap pan said "You could be pregnant" and I'm like...hmm.. no I just bled two days ago and CB is infertile thanks to the many drugs he inhales into his system. They concurred in merry laughter and I was left wondering...wow.. can you imagine if he is truly infertile? like Tom Cruise? It would somewhat make me feel weird.. not bad just weird like.. cool..weird... I am truly okay with that. Been is practising the guitar, we had a night of trashy TV starting with that Newlyweds show with Jessica I-have-the-brain-capacity-of-a-fruit-fly Simpson... 
(insert 3 hour block here) 
Ok I'm back, can't talk anymore. More later.

       I've decided a few things today, I've decided that I can't look back at my day as a story of events happening. It just doesn't sound true. I can't write boring, although my last 5 entries have been...it's because I've been trying an experiment. (snicker) Geez I'm stoned... okay I'll try again... can I write events in a pause like fashion? Yeah but I don't enjoy it. Let's have a look at the inside of recollections. What has been happening the past day? Well Valentine's Day came and went, and we ended up doing a lot of what we wanted to do, which was fine by me since I was just fleeting the day since I don't believe in commercialism, however CB really did like his Nosferatu zippo lighter, although Bob Dreads sold me a shitty wick with it and it needs to be soaked in fuel to keep on lighting. Anyways CB did go with me to the Art Gallery and we made out in Hyde Park and then made our way to Newtown where we ate dinner in some park, and the Bird Man came and talked to us...I wanted to give him food...but he is somewhat scary... 
I don't know, CB gave me some amber earrings and Weezer's latest album, so was great for that. But it was strange that it was so unique, I never wanted to know what a second Valentines would feel like, it felt great, the sex was insane. Actually you know, it was a pretty good day, but I guess today was so fucking boring that I just can't be ethusiastic about yesterday although it was very cool. I love him, and it felt just alien how long it's lasted. I feel some what fated and it doesn't feel bad, it just feels funny. Har. He loves me, I guess I should listen to what Rhett once said to me "Don't ever believe that you're lucky to be in love, always believe that you deserve it" He is very right.  
My god, there is a Triforce of people who read Purple Bitch! So how funny is that line she said about  urlLink  Howie?   
"When he got us to raise our mobile phones in "Collide" (so much more acceptable than cigarettes nowadays) I had a rock and roll 'moment'" 
She didn't have a rock and roll moment...she got high on her own sense of delusion. So high she thought the other people there would be such fucking tossers to hold up their mark of commercialism and masturbate Satan's cock in UNISON. What a fuckwit, why won't she die? You know that's the only reason why I read her blog, to see when she will stop writing and for her sister to write on her blog "Purple Bitch died of a broken heart when she found out that the love of her life American boyfriend is really a director of a porno network and filmed her fucking three guys an a giant dildo in the shape of Howie Day. Why did she do it? I don't know, she is a fucking imitation vinyl covered moron and I as her sister is glad of her immediate death" That's so below the belt, but who cares? This is greatly amusing me.
Anyways I have to go, oh and for that little Paris Hilton fan who reads this: Enjoy!

       It's been a long time.. but the thing is that I don't like this blog looks. I am really thinking about starting from scratch again. I change my mind... all the time it's horrible. I've been busy with other stuff too, it's hard to explain.  I'll catch up soon, I swear.

       I'm in the mood to write, yet not to write anything interesting, just critical. Why is it that people born around 1991 and beyond.. and have access to the internet...can't fucking spell? And I mean, really can't spell. WHY are you going to have a blog if your ramblings are so incoherent that just reading one twisted word makes my mind recoil in horror? I'm talking about sites like  urlLink  this one   and  urlLink  this one  . I'm not going to contact these kids and ask them for their home address so I can send them a dictionary...although I really fucking want to. I weep for the future. Why are schools so damn cheap? Do you want the future to be littered with over hyped over commercialised illiterate and wasteful pods? or do you want educated and compassionate human beings? I don't know.. I don't even know if the latter exist. You are all so self absorbed..spend money on schools..please..
 
If you want to check out some funky kids doing some funky dance moves... go  urlLink  here   check it out, trust me, you won't be dissapointed. The second kid is amazing....I want one.

   You are Astaroth  - 
Your combination of being both silly and scary is what makes you appealing.
It just cracks people up when they see you goof around at one time, and stare people down at another time.
Your unpredictability may confuse some, annoy some, and amuse others, but whatever happens,
you're too caught up with your own thing to conform to other people's standards.
Besides that, the id seems to be the dominant force in your mind
(the part of the mind which demands immediate gratification)

What the fuck? I hate that guy, he is like so fucking evil and unfair...one time I was playing as Sophitita and he fully just grabbed me, twirled me like a basketball, then dropped kicked me in the head then axed me a few times.. that was so not cool! Plus he is a big fat alien.. is that me, peoples? Hm.. don't answer that... I *really* wanted to be IVY or SOPHITIA... oh well...

       I fucking hate my periods. A guy once told me, why do women go on and on about their periods? I remember saying, why do men go on and on about sex? tits and ass? You have voyerism, we have pain that will cripple you in a second EVERY month, so excuse me if we are not so eager to fuck like rabbits because we are vomiting..and having bloated sex is about as sexy as fucking a rabbit. Margaret Cho was right.. you guys will be non stop if you had to bleed... every single month you would godamn bitch, so shut up. Urgh, why won't this discomfort go away? I blame the great sex the day I thought I got them (I really got them the next day) and it must've done something to my insides...Okay that's getting graphic I must stop. Went out last night and thanks to my horrible condition I didn't have a GREAT time, I had a fun time, and it was cool, but I couldn't drink too much thanks to my pills (1 and a half Long island Ice Teas isn't drinking) and had okay conversations that I couldn't muster ethusiasm for because I was in pain. *Insert Sigh here* It was Vix's 20th birthday, man when she got home with Eds, she was so trashed, such a little trashbag. Me and Eds watched "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" till 6am, and then I crashed out in bed. Woke up about 2 hours ago now, and had to talk to my mother about tomorrow. Yeah tomorrow is Vix's lunch at mums house, which should be fine. I want to go because frankly I hate this house in it's current state and I want to eat real food. Remember that? Hmmm cooked food... Mum is getting me a Wacom tablet for my birthday and a Microwave as a housewarming gift. Isn't she the sweetest? I could get used to looking forward to my day of Birth.. this year I turn 25. Time to start living...in a productive way.

       That such a silly rant, in the end it all worked out. I'm not really feeling all that crash hot, but you know that's the price to pay for the current lifestyle. I wonder what it would be like just living with CB, just him and me. Hmm, it will be quiet at least for a time, for us to get settled then it will be ok. I'm trying actually not to think about this morning, man this morning was such a fucking waste of time.. Grrrr... ever had your mind split up with two random thoughts? I've been having that all day...Damn I can't write tonight. Maybe later.

       Today hasn't really started, so I don't even know why I'm here. I guess to talk about my moving out soon, yeah didn't you know? I guess I've been really bad about updating, but hmm yeah it's a big thing, we are moving after my 25th birthday. I'm kind of looking forward to it, and somewhat not, like going to the dentist...you know you have to go, but you also know it's going to hurt. Vixs is moving in with Bangs and OJ's, which is a cool thing, I just hope she keeps it together and doesn't have anymore dramas. I just hate dramas, and something tells me that Bangs isn't going to like the type of dramas Vixs is capable of pulling off, but maybe this move will help her be happy, so it's not so bad. I'm going today to see if I can get my ID, this is somewhat pivotal since my social life will somehow diminish (???) if I don't have a card to get me into pubs. Ah pubs. What a love-hate relationship I have with them, I personally think they are boring unless you are totally fucking trashed, and I don't want to be totally fucking trashed every Friday night, but if I want to see my friends... 
Been playing a lot of the Vines new album, favourite track is "TV Pro" which is amazing; hey I just have to stop there for a second and have a small rant. Ahem.
Since when..is saying "I don't write for an audience" a personal attack? Like it somehow hurts a person to say those words? How can it hurt someone? And I don't mean twisting the words so you can manipulate yourself into feeling inferior, you don't have to make me an accomplice in your quest to feel like shit. I can understand if I had said "I don't write like you.. You suck" or if I had said "You write for an audience, I don't, because I write good shit and you write crap" I mean.. Yeah I can understand that, fucking fine. Go ahead, call me a bitch because it's definitely true, but responding like a you've just seen a demon, from what I originally said? A simple sentence that justified the reason why I am writing about the Vine's yet to be released album? Does it have ANYTHING to do with the person? NO. Nothing whatsoever.  Don't make a face like that at me, and fucking MOCK ME because I said a simple line in English, you can go on and on about my tone, my fucking body language all you want because I know what I said and what I meant. I don't give a FUCK if no one knows what I'm talking about, I write this for me and no-one reads this anyways. If you write for an audience, FINE, so what? You want a medal? Leave me alone, I'm so sick of saying something wether in jest or in a weird tone or whatever, people just fucking jump at me, I need to get one of those books that talks about relating, because people have too many hangs ups and too many ways of manipulation and I have no idea, no clue anymore. Anyone with mental problems and hang ups, will you leave them at the door please!??! At least when talking with me, because frankly you might as well be talking in a different language, and since it's your fucking experience, it probably is. 
End of Rant.
Anyways back to reality, I have to go soon, go to evil Metro. It's the daggiest place on earth. Anyways I have to go, damn my rant actually took away what I was going to say.. ah well.

Having to apply for jobs, go to an interview, go to Redfern, tried not to get mugged, and then come home to realise that Purple Bitch  is going to get married, and somehow that made me even more tired... man.. Why? You don't know the fucker. Get used to that reality. I just *had* to post my disgust for that soap opera trash bag...Anyways, I have to go.... the day is continuing still.

       Did I promise you some pictures? I bet I did... I haven't done much today apart from going grocery shopping .. I forgot my credit card and Been had to drive back home to go look for it. She didn't find it, but instead found Vixs at home and borrowed money from her. Ah money, you evil temptress you... Least to say, Been was pissed off, but not too muchly, much to my eternal relief. 
Here is the first picture, this is what I currently look like, I took the photo myself .... (you know... my sister is making the funniest snoring noises right now.. she sounds like a far away truck.. har. har. She is so going to kill me for saying that)
I have been swept away in the girly excitement of this awesome Nikon digi camera.. it's so fucking cool. The only thing is I had to compress the images to store them, and I meant for them to be in black and white, colour is too crisp and revealing. If-You-Know-What-I-Mean, if you don't --- forget about it. Black and White is more arty. Actually looking at it now.. you would think I had war-paint on.. but that's just the shadow of my hand when I held out the camera in front of me.. must learn on how to not let that happen.... 
 
    
 
This is me and CB, I took it in such a bad angle.. I look like a whale about to beach itself in the sun. Don't laugh. I'm serious. Har, yeah right...me serious? So yeah, I personally think CB looks yummy in this shot. But then again, he is always yummy. [lick] 
 
 
   
 
 
And just for laughs... Been and Freddy... oh yes.. Freddy's coming for you.. and anything of food value that you may possess...watch out. He's evil, but (as Beenie would say) soooooo fluffy!! 
 
    
 
Did I mention that I have to go to a job interview tomorrow? it's so going to be crazy...actually tomorrow is another big day. Yay for me.

       The bombs... 
Very presumptuous of them. I can say, with a strong sense of humanity, this to the suicide bombers: I hope that when you die, you get faced with a God that doesn't like the fact you killed 100+ people...because the look on your face. Would be priceless.  
That or eternal darkness, can you imagine? The bomber looking into an endless sea of black, just thinking "Shit..." 
I have enough knowledge to know that faith and religion is a self preservation need, we need to know, that when we die, something happens. That we need to world and nature to be explained, because it is so much bigger than us, in everyway. Just that definition alone cancels "Let's blow it up!?
How fucking presumptuous! Who the hell are you to decide, who lives and who dies? Isn't your God, ever knowing? Ever powerful? How dare you fashion yourself to this God? You don't know shit. It's that same fucking arrogance, that same power hungry attitude, which the USA spiels under the disguise of "necessary" and "danger". 
I don't like the fact that we are littering the world with Capitalistic garbage, that kids of today spell everything with a Z in it... that people are so obsessed with looks that they judge a person before they can open their mouths, and I hate how that prejudice comes so naturally to all of us. I hate depression, that feeling which makes us believe we aren't good enough... I hate oppression, the fact that we need to better than our fellow man, even if we have to break their legs to prove it. I hate how Iraq was bombed and how those people were killed, in desperation and terror. Just how I hate war in every sense, how in every war, in every invasion, innocent people were robbed of their chance to live. I hate how some people are so fucking fat they can't get out of their front door, and yet a child can live and die in starvation, knowing only disease, dirty water and violence. Yes, it's fucking shitty, yes it's terribly unbalanced, and YES in some small way we are all guilty of what this world has become thanks to laziness.  
But its two fundamental little boys, stubbornly saying their God, is the correct God. And they have our mouths taped shut. And nothing changed, it's a never ending cycle, its like watching "Pinky and the Brain", over and over again. What's the deal? Why are we appointing people as rulers (are we? Well we are told we do..) who just regurgitate ancient crap?  
No matter how much you read, it will always be propaganda. All you need to know, in the end, are the facts. And the fact is? the ignorant, the starving, the overworked, the desperate, the depressed, the drunk, the poor...etc...etc... outweigh "The Happily and Self Deserving Rich". In a real democracy, on a world scale, things will be different. I can assure you, but we will never know for sure.

       What happened today? On this long, long day? I woke up to the sounds of my sister telling me there is a prospective employer on the phone. In my crusty state, I make my way downstairs, down and out in the darkness of late morning. Why are the lights on? I mumble some ethusiasm and make an appointment for Thursday. Fun so far? I then spend the next 2 hours washing dishes that are encrusted with a soggy, expired and decaying cheeseburger that was soaked with water so it was like a wad of putty lard....try scraping that off roach shitted dishes for long. I felt like I was in hell.  
I then was subjected to the worst news of my life. Which I won't discuss here, let's just say Telstra, the evil whore of demon seed...grrrr, is involved. I can't help but hate them, it just comes natural to me. I'm a loyal customer, but that's saying too much. Alright I then went to Redfern, saw a guy I work with but who I secretly think is a terrorist, said my anxious goodbyes, and was relieved in the news that I will be paid some money tomorrow. I have a BIG day tomorrow, fucking huge. But anyways, the day just dragged after that. It's not so interesting as this ...

I know I promised digital photos... AND I have taken a lot of them, but my fat lazy sister won't go upstairs and look for the cord that connects the camera to the computer... and I'm too lazy to do the same. But then again, it's her camera, but on the other hand, I took the pictures. Dilemmas, Dilemmas. I feel like love today, I guess it's the overdose on CB's kisses, Sex and the City, and the fact that today.. I overcame fraility. I walked home from Redfern and had a long talk to myself about the tragic news. I felt so stupid...because injustice is a terrible thing and because I didn't know any better when I was younger. I'm drinking a lot of Bicardi and Orange, right now. It's so funny because once again Been has "The Ring" on.

       I keep meaning to read the new update on blogger.com, but uh... it has the word "Texas" in it, and yall know how I feel about Texas. I'm slightly hungry which is odd but somewhat logical since I usually eat at this god awful time. Odd, because I had an enormous feast at mum's house (Vix's Birthday Lunch) which looked like a lot of food, until I realised I could only eat half of it. CB is watching "BulletProof Monk", I don't know what to say about that. Just like I don't know what to say about my mother's plan to send me and Vixs to Mexico, Cuba and El Salvador. That would be fucking awesome, but it would mean being 3 months away from CB, I really want him to go, although I don't know how he could pull it off. I had a thought tonight as Bri and Vixs went to get some DVD's from his apartment tonight (yeah I was around my old hood again where I grew up, it was like.. Bizarro World) that perhaps maybe it would be a good thing if I went away in a year, just because then it might make him truly explore his creative freer side. I won't be there, he would be totally in his element. And I trust him, you can't love a man if you don't trust him. Yeah I know, I can hear you paranoid women screaming saying "Don't trust no man!" but that could be just a psychological reflection on how I believe that I'm not worth being loved. I hate how I grew up with that notion, that love equals worth. Fuck that.  
I love how when I am reading Purple Bitch (See list of links) and she says something like "I'm most sad because I was keen to show Madelyn that there is a cool world beyond English speaking films. We should have rented Amelie."
The fact that her sister knows nothing about foreign film in the year 2004, and that Purple Bitch's experience with foreign films was the ONE film that I showed her, three Mardi Gras ago... just shows what a fucking ignorant world we live in...if we lived in Newcastle. Sheeesh. Pretty scary huh? 
I'm soooo thirsty. Vixs got a digital camera for her birthday and so I might post a few photos in a couple of days. Till then.

       My thumb is sore from playing Soul Calibur 2. Ow. I'm so bored, usually when I'm bored I do something exciting, but what is there to do? I hate playing a game that constantly beats me. Oh why do I suck with Ivy? I mean.. suck in the sense that I can't pull off the moves that I really want.. I guess it's practise. She has this really awesome move where she grabs them from behind, makes them kneel like a dog, she then wraps her chained whip around their neck and strangles them! she actually yells "STRRRRRRANGLE!" It's great! I mean I can pull it off in training mode, and during some fights I go and grab what *I* think is a left grab, but it turns out to be that move. So when I pull it off, it's entirely consequential. Oh well, whatever. I'm going out tonight, so that should be fun. At least I think I am.. we shall see. Ho hum. Bored. Bored.

       Today was kinda exhausting, it was pretty ordinary, so I won't yawn out the details. You know, I just left PurplePuke's (I love that moniker, it totally suits her, Bitch implies intelligence!) and uh... I felt emotionally drenched. I wonder... I'm not saying online love isn't possible, y'all know that it doesn't matter to me how you fall in love. But the fact that he has another girlfriend? She isn't ready for it, and she knows it. Why deny it? That's just sooo fucking obvious, but it took her weeks and months to figure it out. If she actually has figured it out, and hasn't drowned in her "Self Affirmation" wank fest she is getting from her "concerned and intellectual" faceless community of friends since the -tarry guy posted. Oh whatever, she truly is a boring human being.

       Lately, I have been hit with the Big Blue Bag....oh yeah Depression. But it's fleeting, and I am hoping that it will go away. There is some guy posting some funny comments on Purple Bitch's journal... it's fucking hilarious. I don't know if he articulated it in a language she understands, which is... you are not worth the shit you bring onto yourself...stop fucking YEARNING, it's disgusting, and it makes you a weak willed woman. Love will find you, not the other way around, just accept the fact that somethings in life, you cannot control. MAN.... a rock chick with a Liza Minelli complex? MF....y'all know what I mean. DIE. Maybe even I can't understand why I don't like her, I think it's because she puts too much importance on labelling herself, it's pretty transparent, and although she is a good writer. She knows shit about life. You have to have both talent and experience to be a great writer, otherwise you are a mediocre joke. Poly-what? Men have fucking controlled us for too long, we don't have to put our deepest desires down for ANY MAN. You want him whole, not half man bullshit. What if he meets another fuck buddy that "means something special to him"? It's just wrong! So wrong! A feminist? Purple Bitch? I'm sorry but I have met DOORMATS and XMAS ORNAMENTS who are more feminist that her! I'm slightly drunk and more aggressive than normal.. but god damn. Okay that's over. I was just like this when Jane forgave Micheal on Melrose Place. Whoa. 
 Anyways, I just feel really bad, just one of those days where everyone is agaisnt me, and all I want is to crawl under the covers and cry. Chocolate would be nice.

       Man, I am so tired...working with juice and smoothies is very crazy stuff. I had this real depressing thought afterwards...What the hell am I doing? I vowed never to work with people only computers... ha. I did no such thing.. but damn, customer service again? The only reason why I'm doing it is because I need money. I need money in a very bad way, because of that horrible thing, I will never mention on this blog. It's such a looming amount, I need to pay it back. It's so fucking unfair.. blah blah blah. I hate setbacks. And not to mention that I'm moving out soon. Me and CB have to start looking for places in April, and the weird thing is...Been's car is totally fucked up. Which will make it so much harder, please friends, please if you own a vehicle.. and you are my friend.. and you are reading this.. please.. please help me. I guess I have Bangs.. aw she's so cute Bangs. Me likes her. She nudged Reddy who gave me free tickets to see "Monster". The nudge is a very helpful thing. I find Taureans to be so genuinely nice, we are truly the nice people of the zodiac. We honest to God, don't give a fuck. I mean it, we really don't care. If we have a million gold nuggets.. and we know we can spare the million gold nuggets.. we give it away, in a good and merry way. Ah, the true generosity, we do it, because we can spare it, and because we love to give, and to recieve and to spread wealth and prosperity. If you are a taurus are are thinking "that's not me, I hate everyone, and I am a bitter soul and I'm a Taurus" I say to you.. you have a very conflicting chart, and your ascedant is probably a Capricorn. Ha.  
Only someone with a Capricorn/Taurus conflicting chart (meaning it's full of conflicting planets) can have the confidence to say "I'm a rotten Grinch" and actually be proud of it. I love that word.. Grrrrrinch. I saw the movie going for $20 today at HMV... hmmm...did I mention I went for a job there? unfortunatly it was during my bout with depression, so I didn't get it. It's all about preparation and a small case of denial, to get you through interviews. What the hell does that mean? Well it means that you have to research the company, know about it's backbone, and when you walk through the door to meet your prospective employer you have to deny every one of your flaws. YOU DON'T HAVE FLAWS. That's right, I don't. Now hire me. NOW. CB yesterday said I was pushy, but he doesn't realise if I don't push him, he won't get off me. Last night was very romantic, I know, how disgusting. But he was in a mood you know? singing "The Rainbow Connection" which to an old battered Idealist like me, is simply beautiful, and making out for hours before going to bed. Naked warthm is so nice... it makes me want to be a better person. I want to move out and have our only space.. just me and him. It will be something that we both need, and once we settle, once everything is warm and secure, then we can travel. And man, I will have a TABLE to work in, a Studio to call my own. CB can start to organise his book. I am very excited about this... and I want it to work. Because you know, I've lived my life in the shit paddock for too long. I've pushed aside responsibility...and hated anything to do with pain. But you can't run away for ever, you never stay long enough to produce a life's work of expression, of vision. If anything, I was meant to record this world, and to have my say about it. Surely that's gotta mean something... I've lived for the moment, and the moment is so fleeting, so superficial...I need substance damn it.

       Friday was nice, it was a late morning, a sunny (I bitched the whole way) walk to Newtown. Walked to the cinema, and just before we reached it we saw BGDan, which was so cool, since he was stoned, didn't know where he was going, and told us that he will swing by later. He didn't call, but he could've, my phone is such a piece of crap. Went and saw "Monster" which was just simply amazing, I don't really know why, but it satisfied my curiosity for the world of serial killing. I don't want to be one, I just find them incredibly interesting. Really.. what were they thinking? It's fucking mind boggling. I was watching it, but even I could see Charlize overacting, did she deserve the role? Yeah, actually she did. You can't help but overact with a melodramatic character. Brilliant work. Anyways I've been busy doing some design jobs, it's been fun, although I'm getting paid in brownies. Har. Oh wait, I saw Loz today too, she told me she's been in Brisbane for a month, couldn't handle the stress of restaurant work, but is now back at it. She's a machine. Well we ended up eating Indian for dinner and going to The Bank for a Long Island Iced Tea, which was lovely. I am addicted to licor soaked glaced cherries, they are so yummy. Me and CB were acting like married people today, it was kinda funny. He is so grumpy sometimes, it's so cute.  
CB: (re-arranging the DVD collecting) 
D: Why are you taking your DVD's out? Are you going to put them upstairs? 
CB: Yes. 
D:   Then can you bring down American Beauty from upstairs? It's been up there for ages. 
CB: Why are you angry? There is absolutly no reason for you to be angry, so don't look for one. 
D: What? I'm not angry ...just don't do that! It's so stupid, I just arranged them half an hour ago, it took me AGES. 
CB: I'm doing it, so there would be room on the shelf for all these other DVD's that are stacked up near the TV speakers. I told you, you get angry for no reason. 
D: (sulky) You would be angry too if someone came and messed up your system.  
CB: Whatever man.. 
D: What are you doing? Little Shop of Horrors isn't yours...  
CB:  Yes it is. 
D: No it isn't. 
CB: YES IT IS. 
D: Have a long hard look at it.. 
CB: (flips the cover) Oh wait, this isn't mine. I own the original, the one with Jack in it.. 
D: Yes I know. Now put it down... 
CB: (puts it away, and heaves his stack upstairs) 
D: (lighting a cigarette). Ha. 
 
By the way.. that's me being mean...you should see how evil he was when I was helping him clean the top of the kitchen cupboards today.. whoa..he was worse than me on PMS. 
But now.. no time, I have to finish more designs.

       Vix's came home with Been at 2AM Thursday morning, they had been at Townies, drinking and playing Trivia for a couple of hours. Vix promptly went upstairs, reminded Been to wake her up at 6AM, and after a brief moment, Dee heard her bedroom door shut. Vix will not wake up until 9AM later that morning. Around 3:45AM, Been decided to take a shower before she went to bed, Dee stayed downstairs on the Internet, checking out her favorite forums and reading  urlLink lil' dragon's website   Around 3:55AM, Been emerged to tell Dee that she is going to bed, Dee said goodnight and turned off the computer, checked the front door, locked it, and walks upstairs to the bathroom. In the bathroom, Dee brushed her teeth, as she does every night, amusing herself while brushing by looking around the room. Nothing unusual was noted. 4AM Dee is asleep.  
[BLANK] 
7:30AM Thursday 1st of April 2004, CB woke up and walked to the bathroom to have a shower. Before opening the shower door he realised that there was something in the bathtub, partly covered by a grey long sleeved shirt. He looked closer and reeled back in horror when he realised it was a large pile of human waste. Disgusted, but slighted jaded, he took a shower anyway. CB opened the locked front door at 8:03AM, and went to work.  
At 9:00AM, Dee is woken up by her mobile phone and let's it snooze till 9:15AM. Dee wakes up to the sound of the alarm, and hears Vix downstairs listening to Jet, she messages work for the day off, and went back to sleep. 
10AM, Dee woke up for the third time that day and walked downstairs, for breakfast and her morning Soul Calibur training session. She then used the bottom level bathroom, and primed the second coat on a new stretched canvas. Vix was awake and typing up and assignment from 9AM till 1PM. 1PM, Dee is playing Soul Calibur when she hears Been come down the stairs saying "Why is there a pile of shit in the bathroom?", at first Dee and Vix's thought about the cat, or what Been meant by "shit". They all went upstairs and there it was. A giant fresh pat of human faeces. A turd was found amidst the towels whilst the tub was being cleaned. 
Nobody knows who did it, Dee stresses the fact that nobody in the house would be so disgusting to do that in their own home and not clean it up, no matter how fucking wasted they were. Paul and Ryan from next door, suggested an evil April's Fool Joke, but the crime was committed between 4AM and 7:30AM, who has friends that dedicated and filthy?   There was nothing stolen. In fact, Vix's digital camera, worth at least $900, was left on the coffee table untouched. The mystery is unresolved. True story.  
 
Let me tell you something, there is nothing more fucking disgusting than cleaning shit. I wasn't born to do it, that's just filthy. What a disgusting evil person that did that to our bathroom, and poor Vixs and me, the Civilized, who had to clean it. There is a serial rapist, roaming around the Inner West, Sydney. We think it's him. It's so gross.

       It's baaack. Or should I say, I'm back? I haven't been eating, that should the first issue I should address. Yes, people I am now so poor that I cannot feed myself. Or maybe I'm too busy, and too poor to actually eat? Either way, when I eat, it's utter CRAP, so it's not like I'm totally starving. I would have to be losing weight for that...  
Man...having to fix up all those mistakes in the past post was torture...evil html...  
My mind is pure turmoil tonight.  
I had a meeting with the producers of a TV show (it's in it's pilot stage) this morning, I am going to be doing their promotional kits for the stations, actually I finalized the colour scheme today, well one of them at least. I should email it to The Dude tomorrow morning, right now I couldn't be fucked dealing with the outside world, I mean in all honesty does the world really exist between 11pm and 4am? I also primed a canvas that will feature an art novoue woman, completly simple and beautiful in oils. It's going to be a piece in Boothies play, which is going to be opening in a gallery... so if someone likes it... well I fucking hope this is my break. I really don't want to go to work tomorrow, knowing that I could be sandpapering and base colouring my canvas, and doing more research for the promotional kit which is due in like a month.. I mean all these interesting wonderful things I could be doing.. should I call and tell Cam? hmmm... I shall think about that. I could get up at 10am, sound good huh? Speaking of time... the girls are not back from the pub. That sucks, they were supposed to bring me food. Tonight, CB pretty much slept, poor baby, he's so tired. He said something that touched me today, he whispered "my beautiful dee" before he kissed me , half asleep. That was so sweet. Until I realised... was he being a tad possesive? or delusional? hehe, man I have been watching waaay too much Sex and the City to think that was a joke! ^_^

       I am so trashed, dabbling in the world of All Nighters, uppers and downers all in one night. We did it once before, Thursday night we went and saw "50 First Dates" which in my condition was torture, so me and CB left to make out in the parking lot, and to see the city skyline. There was a Scientology convention that night, we saw them mill out of that building, and I was convinced it was some sort of hush hush sex group thing, I mean it has to be, why else would you go? We then went to Townies and had a couple of drinks, come Friday we pretty much just rode the comedown wave, and Saturday we were supposed to go to Sexy Bread's gig but CB had to work this morning so we stayed home, went to the park, swinged on the swings really high, drank some tequila, smoked and ended up at home. Now I'm just tired, it was daylight savings today so it wasn't too shabby, CB stayed an extra hour with me in bed this morning, I worry about him spending so much money but I know why he is doing it, we are never going to be living this lifestyle again. I mean it's pretty much going to be over in a couple of weeks, and soon it's going to be a resolution of our Quater Life crisis. I wonder how Been will take the seperation, she will probably go over Vixs house a lot, she won't be coming to mine as much because I'm not going to be doing any sort of smoking, unless it's tabacco. But what's going to be the best thing about that, is that I won't be smoking much because I'll be so busy. I do worry about her, because I think weed is her crutch. She comes through the door and has a cone. Nothing wrong with that NOW, but what about later? Future thinking is a symptom of growing older. I'm slightly hungry, but have no energy to get the hell up. Har.  urlLink  Purple Bitch   talked herself into accepting polygamy again. What a fucking idiot.

       Ah the immature rants over at Purple Bitch's blog, the dribbling immature unquotable phrases like : "give me a fucking break, you moron. you might want to set down those big, overpriced books you think make you sound smart, and actually get a fucking life." It's so funny that the stupid actually think you learn big words in EXPENSIVE books. I always thought the dictionary was a pretty cheap buy wasn't it? I mean I got my first for $10 back when I was 8 and through my love of secondhand books and political texts, I think that perhaps I got my intelligence through comprehension, insight and general opinionated thought. I'm sure Brian is the same, though through different means, and didn't need to spend money to implant a "smart chip" from a "expensive smart book". Hahaha, and he is another one who thinks that quoting him is giving him justice. Fucker. Is someone putting a cigarette in your eye flattering? Whatever, today I give my resignation to giving that bitch the time of day.  
Today was interesting, looked through some property, I had looked at 3 houses on Thursday, during the day, and none of them were..urgh...um actually all of them WERE like they featured in a serial killers evidence file. Grotesque and totally unliveable, but we are running out of time. Today the first house wasn't too bad, but the second was an overpriced tuff of grime. It's crazy, but I am feeling a little angsty and anxious (at the same time!?) about finding a place, let us just find a fucking place!!! this is crazy! Hmm.  
I met this guy at the bar on Thursday night, his name was Edge. I was alone at this stage, because Been was pashing Gollum, and Vixs and Bangs had their prey, and so I couldn't exactly crash their "drunken moment" so I sat there and he noticed that I was drinking my vodka and watching him play pool. I was quite fucking drunk at this stage and needed to be stimulated since I had tried to hang out with BGDan but he got really irate with this character called Mott, and it got fucking nasty, so I split. So here I am, sitting down, and he says to me, that I should try the next shot. 
D: "What? I'm watching, not playing" 
E: "Try it, and see" 
So I tried to play, and he was all, you know, the flirting stuff, and I was like.. "My bf is really good at this, he knows all the angles and stuff" 
He finished his lesson then got the fuck out of there. Funny story, to think that he though, that I would've let him feel me up if I wasn't taken. What a sleaze. It's like this.... he didn't want to get to know me as a person, he wanted to keep on flirting and get a pash. As if...gross.   
At least that's how I interpreted, perhaps it was because he saw me in a bad light and thought...no way!!  Haha. Crazy. 
Beenie just pulled Dodger by his chicken legs and he stretched like taffy candy... he's so cute, and Beenie is so cruel. :D
Everyone is here, so I should get back to the party. I had Clems, marinated drumsticks today for lunch... sooo yummy.

       Ergh I went out last night, ended up leaving the house at 11pm, and getting to the bar on Broadway shortly after. Got there and immediatly a glass of wine was thrust into my hand and a cigarette. Thanks for speeding up my death, no really, this is why I go out. On seeing Slim and all the crew from the old days, had great talks and a lot of photos were taken. Had a good talk with BGDan and everyone there, until it closed and we all headed to the Century Tavern.  
Wait, why was I there again? Slim was going to Tokyo and then Eastern Europe, I wasn't going to see him again for quite awhile, so yeah that's why I made the effort, even though I had no money. Been was good with money though, although I didn't really need much. I told her I was going to give her ten dollars, which to me is quite a cheap night out. And my expenses were roughly that.  
After the broadway bar closed, Me, Been, Bangs and Vixs piled into ChiStev's car and ran around the city, looking for a park for about 20 minutes, until well.. Been got a phone call from Tim-O and so we were dropped us off at the front of the Centrury, where Vixs tried to run in but was stopped by the bouncer. I told her that he only checked her because she was cocky! She retorted with "Doesn't he know who I am?".  
Now for anyone that doesn't know my sister, that would sound bitchy, but she said it because she truly believes it. And who wouldn't? She goes to the Century AT LEAST once a week, she's a regular. It's one of the biggest pick up bars in Sydney, and one of the most sleaziest. Roachboy made an appearance that night, what a fucking tosser. It's easier to care about him, a drunk Vixs slurred. I would stay the fuck away from someone who let's you believe...and doesn't come up with the goods.  Bangs comes up to me around 4AM, both of us quite drunk at this stage, and she said "Roachboy seems okay, he isn't pressuring her or anything"and I said "Let me teach you a lesson in manipulation. Roachboy Style. Here goes, I'm going to let you see just what a nice guy I can be, to fool you, just so you can fuck me. After I've had your pussy, and want another one from somewhere else, and I don't need your pussy for awhile.. THEN I will so casually remind you, like a bludgeon to the face, just what a fucking asshole I am, and you will come back, time and time again, because you keep hoping I'll change, you'll keep hoping that what I'm saying to you is true, that I trully love you, but in the end... all I want is a fuck. But I will deny that of course, because I still want you around to root." 
I still don't know why people aren't realistic, but whatever.  
I need a cigarette, although I haven't had one today and my lungs will probably kill me for it, I don't know. I am truly not feeling the best right now, I mixed waay too many drinks last night, I'm still recovering. 
I did meet quite a few cool people, and I do want to tell you guys, but I am truly really tired.
 
I'm going to go and collapse now.

       I really hate not having any money. I mean I really hate it. But in the end it's all my fault. I didn't hand in my form this week and thus, I have 20 cents to my name. Sounds sooo very broken down doesn't it? Reminds me of the time when Vixs gave me this tearful tirade of fraustration (I think it was last Monday night), I think my favorite line amidst her drunken repetion was "You have such immense talent, such vision, and you sit there so smug, not sharing your secrets". I really liked that, it's something that I will type up, print and put up in my studio when I move out. Yeah I've been looking for a two room place, one for me and CB and the other for a studio. The reason why I brought it up, well, it's just because I'm a fucking lazy slug, and the reason to remain one is becoming more thinner and thinner as I approach a quater of a century. Can't really let myself be distracted anymore....and once I move out I can happily say, I won't be.  
Arrgh, responsibility. Awesome. 
I am going to take the plunge my friends. It's time for me to do what is in my blood and not to be afraid of it anymore. Some people say, you have talent and are afraid? What the fuck? But it's a little deeper than that...it's always about self worth which is interestingly not the same as self respect .. in MY head. I've always said it's like knowing you are good at something, but afraid of it being a delusion. Why? Because surely...someone like me CAN'T have talents nor vision. 
Ah such sorry excuses, pretty pathetic. Plus there are too many weird artists out there who have the will, but not the talent...hehe how evil.  
But it's how I cope, ok?

       People seem to be intensily interested in each other, because due to a nature to compare everything, it's almost a projection of self interest. We are obsessed with circumstance and intent, and how it effects us in the large scheme of things. I am so sure that Purple Bitch will never know, not really, the kind of fascination people hold for her journal, it's not really quite like my fascination with let's say, Politics, which the more I read, the more I feel I understand our current political structure, and thus can form a solid opinion based on facts. It's not quite like that... it's more like the kind of fascination one has for car crash accident sites and  urlLink  sick websites ...we know you are crashing, and we are so fucking glad it's not us. I mean that's why I read her stupid journal, it's also the same reason why I visit rotten.com,  I mean yeah I may be a glutton for punishment, but fuck her if she's going to turn it into a compliment. Hence this entry.  
It's so damn linear that someone like her, who has no outside life outside the computer, can have the audacity to imply that it's a flattering thing that someone seems to mention her on their blog, like the outside world doesn't matter. Let me explain to you the psychological reasoning behind blog entries...people like to cross reference, it's in our nature,that comparative thing I was talking about, we read Purple Bitch's impeccably tragic blog and suddendly that rant we were going to write about our boss, or about a cute guy that smiled at us today, get's completly oblitirated by her fucking stupidity. Suddendly, like watching Jane take Micheal back (from Melrose Place -   yes, it has been that long since I watched a soap opera ) we get irate and we think. Geez, man, is she fucking stupid or what? I mean, she just seems to be growing more and more delusional. I mean, sure touching is one thing, but fucking is another. I laugh at women who say sex doesn't affect or change them in someway, and I mean penetration baby. There is a reason why the stupid bitch is practising on tampons, she is petrified she won't cut it, and will take anything in her fevered desperation. Love? With a man who will fuck in her house, in her bed with other women? She dribbled out an excuse like.. Boundaries will be set.. 
Ha.  
American Shitbag: Oh Jamie is going to be coming over tomorrow, is it ok if we have some time alone? (pause)
if it makes you upset..I won't worry about it.. I'll call her..it's just that she can't talk in her apartment, and she doesn't have much money or do I for that matter...for a hotel suite ......and she really wants to talk to me only..face to face. "
(translation: She is getting sick of you getting in the way, always wanting attention, always wanting to show us how "Good in Bed" you're getting, like a drooling puppy, so fuck off.) 
Purple Bitch: Oh no...no...it's okay. It's okay, I understand too. She needs her time with you alone huh?  
American Shitbag: (nods) 
Purple Bitch: Okay, I'll go out, it'll be fun. 
American Shitbag: Thank you so much. I love you. 
Purple BItch: I love you too. We are so much in love. 
American Shitbag: Yes we are. 
 
And the next night? He's fucking Jamie doggie style on his wife's bed and Purple Bitch is out there, wringing her hands, and tossing her defiant head,  with her network of wankfest idiots who symphathise but don't fucking knock her head IN with some logic. She will vow to be more steel spined than that next time.. and she will become more steeled spined...until one day she wakes up a bitter woman. How can a virgin...marry someone who is going to be fucking other women? Does this make sense to ANYONE? To tell you the truth, her boyfriend looks like a grown up version of August Gloop from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, so all he will be getting is more neurotic hags who are desperate and WILL settle for Average. I hope he snags a total psycho, Glenn Close style, I will love for that character to go schitzoid on Purple Bitch."He loves ME. ME" she'll screech, Purple Bitch will pale and stammer "He does...he loves both of us...it's okay...it's polyamorous". "Don't be ridiculous! When was the last time he fucked you? He's been fucking me every night for two weeks, and has been too tired to fuck your bony ass. He told me you just laid there and tried to move, but were too inept and stiff. Like fucking a brillo pad. He doesn't love you, he loves ME". Ahhh the possibilities are endless. But I remember having a conversation with Vixs about love, and how there are many definitions and many ways of feeling Love. I agree... I agree that the love a woman feels for a married man is real. It doesn't make it right and it doesn't make it equal. For some people that isn't enough. For people wanting only sex. It's more than enough, maybe the stupid bitch just needs to get laaid. 
Some people can't handle monogamy. Hey that's fine, fuck around and be merry. It's a liberated time, don't commit, Hey you just turned 40 and have had enough sex experience to make you a Happy Pappy? Great, find some other commitment phobic bitch, be her friend and live in a house with a steady diet of companionship, and interior and exterior lovers. Who gives a fuck? You are worldy and that world suits you fine. Big deal. But to get married to an online boyfriend who has another girlfriend, and whom she's never lived with, and who doesn't give a fuck, who she fucks? and she's a virgin? AND a neurotic clingly mess? I mean... surely that's a car accident waiting to happen! Poor Bri tried to make her to see sense, but she is too stupid. So very amazingly stupid, man I feel so sorry for her. But then I remember she likes John Mayer, is trying desparatly to be "saved" from Newcastle and her parents and not doing it on her own (she has to get married to do that too) and all that pity turns into disgust.  She is going to feel so degraded when she tried to please him in bed and there is going to be another woman licking her fingers ..doing it better.  
Do you see what I mean? Her emotional soul (if she has one) will go down and rapture in black negativity and feelings of inferiority. Oh yeah baby, that's EXACTLY what love is.  
 
Fuck her man, it's so weird, I'm in love and I see his sleeping peaceful face every morning, and it is his eyes that focus on me, not the girl on his other side, ME. If he is down, I don't have to tell him "Sorry babe, but I promised Raphael (???) that I will go over his house today. Think you will be ok? He is still upset about his aborted baby, you know the one I had to abort because it wasn't yours. So I won't be long...ok? you're next on my list!" which will make him feel worse, and worse yet, he has been reduced to a CHORE. 
Anyways whatever, I just think it's so contractioary, she says "It's so nice have him there... a phone call away" these sparse internation phonecalls are just as valid as everyday contact, if not more so because there is no nervousness or self consciousness as there would be in real life... and to that I say... And you want to marry the motherfucker?

Loser.
Twat.

May God make her fall flat on her face, so that I may make an example of her to all the inspiring feminist. Be warned ladies, an attitude of a doormat...can leave you emaciated, neurotic and in a polyamourous relationship. Where you will be the traditional wife...while he bangs other border line personality disorder victims in various parts of the USA. Such respect.. she is trully an equal! Who the hell would fuck her? She's hysterical.. amazing. 

I mean, I know that sounds selfish, but I am just outlining the possible outcomes. It is hard to juggle relationships, sometimes you can't please everybody. 


a stupid shit like Purple Bitch? who has the sexual poweress of a stick insect? Who is 23 and has never seen the love of her life in every possible angle you can see a person? Inner. Outer and all those moments in between? I've been with CB for 18 months and there are still some things that I don't know about him. Still learning! Still growing!

       I'm sick. I'm ill. I have a cold. The past week has been a frantic attempt to look for a place to stay. I found a really nice place for $320 per week, WITH a dryer, WITH a dishwashing machine. Two courtyards, a studio AND an ensuite bathroom. Will I get it? I painstakingly wrote the application yesterday and today at 9:30AM, I rocked up to the real estate and handed it in. 
Will I get it? The cynic in me says NO, are you crazy? The optimistic in me just says, Hope it's all you've got! Hope! It's near station and buses, it's so cool. Please!!! I won't post pictures because I'm scared. Really scared that if I don't secure this place...then I won't secure ANYTHING. And everyone will know.. everyone will know that I didn't get it. Isn't it horrible? I just want a recluse from this life, a place that can reset my life. Put it back on track, this apartment is fucking perfect, but life .... (as it points out) is not perfect. And sometimes the lower ladder is the one that suffers the most. *sigh* I was watching Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (yes it was a repeat and YES I watched it anyways) and Carson said something that really hit home with me "Confidence brings Success". I really liked that. I should be more confident, I wrote everything truthfully on that application, I smiled at the real estate lady and I made sure that my application was given to her. She said she will get back to me in 24 hours.. I am slightly afraid because we owe so much rent for this house, it might reflect badly as a reference and I won't get the place. It's a share house the one we are living at, so if she doesn't call me tomorrow morning, then I will assume that I didn't get it, and I will call to ask why, and tell her that it's Been that owes the rent not me. That's a dirty lie (I owe 400 dollars) but it might get me the place? Ha. 
I woke up at 8AM this morning. Isn't that disgusting? Bangs called earlier so that we can go look for more places, but I was like.. no way man. I have to look at houses TOMORROW too... I can't keep doing this. It will do my head in. I need a day to chill, I'm really hungry, I want a burger. More later.

        Ah Bri...sorry about today ...  this morning...all of this afternoon. Sometimes my emotions cannot handle being criticised, especially so unfairly, and I know why I reacted the way I did. I didn't have to...but I have a strange hostility against injustice ....and mixed with insecurity of being criticised by someone whom you want to be perfect for...and mixed with the fact   that we only have 5 days to get a new address   Aahhh my idealised brain and my chemical feelings, just cracked. It was also a very hot day. Listen to me justifying it ... but thanks for today anyways. I know it wasn't fun.  
Hmmm...There are days, where I all I do is berate myself (stress makes for self criticism) for doing just silly things, and since I always think it's my fault...it's awful hearing someone saying it in such a crude and impatient way....much like I said to you...I've grown up with harsh abusive words all my life, from someone I love (Mum)...I don't need it again from my boyfriend. I just fucking lost it. Especially since he was just obviously taking it out on me. Panic, Stress, Disillusionment...you name it, and it was felt today. At least we talked and figured it out, and he was genuine upset, because again...he didn't know why it hurt (why are men so stupid?) and it took Vixs to spell it out for him. Ahhh men. I am sending you a big HUG and I hope you have fun tomorrow!! Thanks again!
 
So...onto other news...what's with The Job? Well I am a receptionist at a College, I get to hang out with students from overseas...this is very promising. It pays well and it's dead easy work. So I'm set, AND since I'm a voracious workaholic, this suits me fine. Don't snort, I am. Ask anyone, ask Been! It's all so good, because I want to make friends with a tiny Japanese girl... I figure she can get me into the country and I can spend endless hours in Japanese Anime HEAVEN. Ah the Japanese...with their great food, horrible teas and a graceful and dignified history...I really can't wait. But most of all...I want to visit Tokyo and the Japanese country side.. me and CB, relaxing with a pipe and good ale underneath Mount Fuji. I like that vision. Shit yeah.  
And so what if the job isn't artistic? I'm not artistic when I'm starving! I can assure you of that! No one is going to tell me I can't have overseas Sea Taffy and overseas Italian handcrafted water colour brushes. So I'm materialistic and I love good food. Who am I justifying this to? Ah yeah I have been reading Purple Bitch again and her justification on just about everything in her life is kinda infectious. It's hilarious how they dance, in their interpretation hell. Fucking idiots. You know, that one particular boring piece of shit, the stupid one? Yeah the one that is rubbing her hands because SHE knows it's her, and actually LIKES the fact people are spitting in her face...yeah the one that calls homosexuals fags, and thinks it's clever. She is so hungry for attention it makes me want to spit bile. And what's with Purple Bitch? she only feels anger when she feels indignant? What the fuck is that? She should just say the truth, it's so much fucking simpler because once she says it she will realise what a godamn fool she is being. 
 Purple Bitch:  I love him. I love him so much because I just do. He is my everything. And it doesn't matter how much he hurts me because I love him and he loves me. He loves me so much. (rolls eyes.. really, how many fucking times can she say that? Does she think that just by saying it, she will magically feel it?) He knows how much he hurt me and is hurting too. He hurts so much that when he said he "never meant for it to happen" he meant "he never really wanted to tell me but thought that Jamie would let it slip, so to save his ass he spat out the truth, twisting it cleverly through manipulation"....and isn't the truth and being honest a lot better than fucking another girl without my permission and NOT telling me?? I must fight this! *delete accounts of people spewing truth* *ignore posts which point out things like...* 
I like this quote so it will get a FULL paragraph 
 
when you say "our" private hells, does that really apply to both you and he or just you? it seems like the only stress he has to deal with is the guilt of doing as he pleases. 
 
Oh fucking brilliant! That was posted by  urlLink tristanwolf  who's site is a complete drivel, but this line makes me immediately respect him, and she ignored it!!! In the background of her mind, Steve's sleazy voice must murmur..."Oh Lauren.. I hurt so much because you hurt. I know I've been bad. Please Forgive Me...it will never happen again...last time I said that I was uh...stupid, not realising how much I truly love you...blah, blah,  phew. He got off easy. And he will keep on getting off easy. Because she replays JUST THAT in her mind, over and over again. She said it herself, that's all she's holding onto. Not realising that 15-20 people that I know, (that's people that *I* know, and I'm 1 person!!!) read her journal and giggle and shake their head in silent pity. She actually thinks people are there to support her, they aren't. They are there to validate their existence, that's why read it. You don't understand the concept of "validate?" Then get the fuck off my blog. IQ required, sweetie. 
We all look at our mostly happy and content (well...fucking REALISTIC more like it) relationships and think...shit. I'm so lucky. Sure I may want to tear their hair out sometimes, because they are human!! but betrayal? Shit girl...no one on this side of reality will take that crap. I never got her anyways, you know that she can't appreciate music through sound? That's fucked up! It's all just words to her, so if she doesn't understand what they are saying, she ain't interested! That's my theory anyways, on why she likes John Mayer and Matchbox 20 and not The White Stripes or The Strokes, because in the realm of poetry and fucking meaning, The White Stripes/Stokes have a lot more art and passion in their words than...well...you know, drivel pop rock) 
Actually I want to talk about that for a minute..because music is a big part of anyone's life, it's what we feed our soul, are we looking into another's soulful expression? of bland rock crap? Let's see a sample of Matchbox 20 lyrics:
 
 
She says it's cold outside and she hands me a raincoat 
She's always worried about things like that  
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault  
 
*blink* She feels insecure about the relationship because you are distant? It's poetic...ssssuuuure....but here is The Strokes taking that situation and adding some truth to it:
 
 
Is this it? 
Is this it? 
Is this it? 
Can't you see I'm trying, I don't even like it  
I just lie to get to your apartment  
Now I'm staying there just for a while  
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired  
 
Now that's a true poetic expression of distant...from a   man's   point of view. Not some little boy with a corporate cock in his mouth. How is art trying to decipher what the other person is feeling? Why do people constantly do that? They justify how THEY feel and then colour everyone's emotions accordingly?! 
I'm angry! therefore you must be apologetic and grovelling! IT'S YOUR FAULT. You must react to MY EMOTIONS as they happen, how I EXPECT it. *Rolls eyes* Jamie didn't give a fuck about fucking Steve, because she doesn't think (snort) Sex has any emotional attachment (she must think to herself that old Phrase "Sex and Love, two different things who like to wear each other's shoes for awhile, you know, Love disguised as Sex, and Sex disguised as Love", although perhaps she doesn't know it yet. ANYWAYS. She didn't give a fuck, so? Why crucify her for it? She's entitled. If you want to say to her. YOU BETRAYED ME. Then why are you willing to share your man with her? You are fighting this aren't you?  How?  Are you telling Steve baby, amidst sulks and tears, don't sleep with her anymore...I don't trust her. As if it's her fault? Oh baby...Oh darling, please don't ever close your blog! This is like Reality TV only more incredible, since I have met you! And I STILL can't believe a person like you exists!  
Ha. What a sap. Those who succeed are those who demand understanding and respect. I'm angry! Do you understand? Don't try to reason with me, for I can't see reason in your argument! I feel fucking hurt, I feel dejected and used. I feel LIED TO. And this is love? IS THIS LOVE? IS THIS IT??? Ha. No way...no way. It's just too zany for me. 
And if this gets out, and that stupid troll decides it's her BUSINESS...bring it on fuckface. A strolling Bovine like yourself...your head will look great on a stick. I need a cigarette, everyone here wants me to join their circle, I have to go upstairs and pack eventually, but I think I will sit around the living room, vodka in one hand and good conversation. I will miss the girls...it's going to be so weird without them. Hey did I mention that there is an apartment right above Been's apartment that is for lease? How awesome! Come on everyone...good feelings...!

       Wow I haven't updated in quite awhile. Mainly because nothing much has happened, I mean what was the last great thing that happened? Me and Vixs split our DVD's and it was pretty messy. She got quite some good ones, she got Fight Club. She got Fight Club because she watches it more, and that was her argument. Because she watches it more than me, she got it. What can I answer to that? Pretty much nothing and let her have it. But I have to buy another copy, because I still remember the night after I watched that movie, it was some night, it's one of those movies where you can remeber your values, like a little JOLT wake up call.  
Urgh I should be doing stuff, but I don't feel so crash hot, thanks to my little red friend whom I loathe. I know I always use it as an excuse, but why shouldn't I? I deserve three days a month where I do nothing. Hmm. I think I went too far... I am listening to The Pixies, and this particular song "Evil Hearted You" I don't know what to make of it. I have heard it before, but should I keep it? I have always felt weird and creeped out listening to Frank Black sing in broken Spanish. Should I delete it? Argh... yeah okay why not. I'm trying to trim the fat out of my music collection. I have a lot of duplicate songs and yanno.. I don't have much hard drive space left. I have 3 Gig left. I still don't have a house. I find out on Monday if I get the cool apartment in Stamore. Tonight me and CB have to finish the applications so I can give them in on Monday, which is going to be a very busy day. It's just so depressing not having a house, and thus my entries would reflect that anxiety, therefore, what's the point in writing ...until I have some good news? I guess... till then...

       Surely I am not supposed to feel this tired. Surely working...doesn't make one feel strangely empty at the end of the day. I blame it on pot, cigarettes, bad diet, the filth upon filth in this house... until I realise I don't know what the hell I want. It's a transition time and I guess that's why I'm confused. I'm also really angry with Telstra, I'm angry because I'm too tired to think about going to the bank at the end of the day (How the hell can I forget that? I have to pay fucking RENT). Somehow I am too scared of carrying $300.00 around in Kings Cross. Well that's not too bad...what could be worse would be if I was reckless, yet still the rent remains unpaid. Such meaningless drivel. I am just tired, and today was long, and today was fine because it's new and although it's stressful, at least the day goes fast. YET it's Wednesday and we have to move on SATURDAY, as in...we have to completly vacate the house before Sunday afternoon...or we are DEAD. And yet we don't have an address. But we might... God knows I don't want to say it out loud just in case I jinx it...so from now on...Bland Face till tomorrow. I am still really stressed though... I think I will totally collapse once I find out if I'm living on the street or on the road ... either way I will be on the ground. Let's hope it's from relief sweetie.

       Good news, I have downloaded my first introduction to CSS. It's sitting in a purple folder somewhere on my desk. I promise I will take it home tonight. 
Today was really bizarro, I woke up all scattered and shit, with that "tonight I'm going to fuck my own brother" song from " Not Another Teen Movie" in my head, but in my mind it was sung by  urlLink Pikmin . Hmm.
I have no recollection of getting ready and only a vague memory of getting on a train, it turns out I also brought two donuts. What was that? I don't eat donuts, I despise them especially with no coffee. I ate them COLD and with Diet Coke. I might as well have shoved sawdust and lard in my mouth. In all those stumblings I finally found myself at my desk, at work, and with no bra. And I haven't washed my hair in three days and frankly...it's starting to show. It's just that I haven't gotten myself ... I just haven't gotten the grasp of time management yet...that or I've lost my mind. On the upside getting to work must've been easy otherwise I would've jarred myself awake with my constant inner bitching. I still don't have the net at home, but I am biting the bullet and posting here from now on when I can. A revamp of this shithole is also in order. But that MUST wait until I get the net at home...sooo until then enjoy the baby blue confused motif. It won't stay, because it must die.

       Finnigan is going to conquer the Toyko boys whilst he is Japan. Tonight I will drink and intoxicate myself in celebration that there is one less red haired rabid Leo in Sydney. No actually, I am celebrating his opportunity to get foreign ass. Ha, his Australian boyfriend will not be please, but in the end...&nbsp;he won't know, so it's ok. 
This morning I bought a coffee and I thought to myself, why am I going to work on a payday? This morning is perfect for a stroll in Hyde Park, for a visit to the MCA, buy a couple of woolly socks and jumpers and lie in the dim sun whilst listening to my Ween mix CD (which actually looks like a small vinyl record, so clever) and daydream. You all know that working on a payday is about as painful as getting root canal work...you have all this financial freedom but you can't do shit about it till Saturday.&nbsp;Listening to one of my favorite tunes on the way here, "It's Going to Be (Alright)" I realised (oops I just changed the topic, keep up peoples!) just how sad the song is, it's terribly depressing... 
"Guess I'm ruled by my heart 
Built a life and I tore it all apart 
It's just not our time 
But you'll find a new love, and you'll be fine 
So many dark and lonely nights 
But I believe someday I'll see the light 
It's gonna be alright, baby 
It's gonna be alright, love 
And if the mist ever lets the sun through 
I'll just hope I did the right thing for me and you"

         Distractions   
You know...relationships never cease to amaze me with their little intricate details...last night me and CB were fooling around, I think I was doing it half hearted I don't even know anymore...he is such a distraction. You know when you have it in your head, Hey alright, this is what I have to do, this is what I WANT to do so I can have a guilt free relaxing time and be content knowing that I don't live in a CESSPIT OF GROSS. So you want to clean up a little, not be having sex....but CB just weakens me...I really need to speak to him about that. There has to be a time and a place right? Either way half assed or not I got a bout of paranoia and I lost the mood, well we both did, so it was weird. It was like...uh...back to the scheduled program. So I did the dishes, petted and injected the cats with their Revolution anti flea/anti worm stuff...and played a round of Soul Calibur with CB. He totally won (8 games to 4) but I belive it was because I played Voldo and Necrid for most of the times, and everybody knows...everybody knows that they suck. *IF* You don't usually play them (whew!)Anyways after that match I realised...man I still live in a Dust Bunny Hellhole...when will I ever escape? I guess it's because of the vacumming >:/
It's just so hard, and I am not a fool to say I'm not struggling. I am very much struggling, and I have no idea how to get out. GOD he is such a distraction, but I can't blame him because I let myself be distracted.  Is there a Distraction Victims Help Line? I have to deplant for at least a little while the Hedonist chip in me...speaking of feeling good. Around 11pm, after some TV and a tuna toast snack, I had a shower, felt great, CB joined me, and believe it or not, it was the best sex we have EVER had. I went blind for at least 15 minutes. Now you know how difficult it is to say no to him and he is so affectionate, but we are both lazy and I am finding it really difficult to try and upkeep my house.  urlLink Help!

       What happened last night? What's going on?? The stupid internet wouldn't work and after a couple of phonecalls this morning...I found out that I wasn't going to get it back till Friday 5pm, what the fuck is that? I do hate you Telstra and your inability to make my life easier. If only I could tape my conversations with their helpdesk...it's all about the tone sweetheart, the tone. In reality I'm not taking it up the ass, I am sending Hate through your overpriced and evil phoneline, so much hate that maybe...*sigh* I just can't believe how much effort Hate is...bah not even worth it. But if their support staff start dropping like flies...you know it's me.  
Well, last night was the night that I made the best cup of coffee ever thanks to  urlLink  Toby's Woolloomooloo blend  , and BeanieD. Yeah welcome another character to my entourage, BeanieD is Been's new boyfriend, he's actually just as obsessive, paranoid, and jelous as her. I predict marriage. Back to the coffee...Toby's coffee is so delicious it doesn't even need sugar (bah to sugar! however I'm an addict so I'll put sugar in anything. Don't test me on that btw.) I've been drinking Toby's coffee now for about three weeks, and this is the first Bag of coffee that I brought. BeanieD told Been (who told me) to put in MILK and SUGAR at the bottom of the cup and then pour the coffee. Well...what I did was put in one teaspoon of sugar and about two dollops of milk and and then whisk it together to form foamy sugary milk and then pour the hot steaming freshly brewed coffee...if you are not converted by then, you have a heart of stone and GET OUT GET OUT! 
I found out yesterday as well that there is an IVY fanlisting, can you imagine? Now Ivy is Isabella Valentine, a playable character in Namco's amazing game "Soul Calibur II" and one of my best fighting talents. I can whip anyone into submission, even my boyfriend who is an amazing player. She is basically a special moves only character, you just can't horizontally/vertically slash someone with her, she will end up on the floor in a minced heap. She just isn't that fast. What Ivy is best at doing is snaring her prey and fucking them up using complicated moves that are very difficult to get out of. Just last night I won 4 out of 5 games with her, she's just the best. I do urge anyone to go to  urlLink  here   and watch a few Ivy videos, however if you see her do some shit move it's not her it's her snot nosed controller, some players out there are just so godamn BAD. Anyways I'm going to be on the list and get a little image thing happening...it might sound really lame, but then again she's a hot domantrix with big tits, and I can live my fantasy can't I? It's better than having a psycho fantasy and not acting it out on any level. That would really suck.
 
Work Bits: Um today was ok, so many students coming to say hello. Hey that's fine by me, I welcome the distraction from my blog (sarcasm). But they are so cute, there is this 14 yr old Korean girl whom I fell in love with today, little dimples and cute smile. She looked like a Hello Kitty commercial. Love it.

        urlLink For some, you just have to spell it out - Opinion - www.smh.com.au  And it was   this   part that reminded me of our dear Blogger : "There is a huge irony here, sadly. Thanks to a miraculous new technology, more people are writing more stuff than ever before. Yet, through a combination of bad education and misguided egalitarianism, the lower the standard of written communication, the better it is perceived to be." Today I ate some cheesecake, drank real coke and smoked a cigarette while playing Soul Calibur. Walked up 3 flights of stairs and amazingly didn't die at the end of it (who said occasional binges aren't bad?) and yet....I find all that interesting enough to talk about it? I mean sure, the world is a funny place and if we don't stop around and make fun of our trivial insanities...what are we left with? an eternal sense of Nirvana? Meaning? Have you seen the news lately? Sometimes my faith for human evolution is just so trite, it's like an impending orgasm with a really over ethusiastic lover. You are so close to believing it could be possible...but then you can't escape the fact that on top of you...is a fevered rat like anticipation PERSONFIED... it's a reality you can't hide from. Are you listening  urlLink Purple Bitch?   You are my fevered rat. I was talking to Bri about her blog and how I hope she keeps writing in it forever. And I said to him
"Bri, I want to be there" 
"Be where sweetie?" 
"There when she crashes and snaps into an unrecoverable, weeping mess" 
"So you can hand her the Bi-Lo razors?" 
"She is going to frizzle and pop into a thin piece of watery flesh when she sees him fucking another woman and gets CONFUSED BY IT. I can't wait". 
Work Bits: I had to sit though a fire drill and I think I passed out for about 3 hours because I don't remember the whole 9am-12pm morning thing....what happened? It was so fucking boring I wanted to kill the presenter. Huh not kill, MAIM. At least her screaming and my stint in jail would have been more productive (someone gets a laptop smashed agaisn't their head..boom, a job's created!) I really have to go and do more art. If I am still up I'll scan today's effort. Mwah.

       Remember that line..."I know your nerves are as raw as meat on a butcher's window.."? It has never made more sense to me than now. After spending most of Saturday night and Sunday morning to try and fit a 200 GIG harddrive into this piece of shit computer...I feel like I can't go on. I hate being here in this tight confinement of a Windows operating system, it won't let me expand, soak or store ANYTHING. You all know that I love gizmos, and shiny electrical things. But - Not - When - They - Don't - Work. Hate Hate. Spiel Spiel. Etc. I had plans, and dreams of Pirates. But now...Western Digital have made my Hate list. 
I didn't do anything exciting this weekend, apart from eat incredibly expensive Indian Food ($16 for a few pieces of chicken?!?...come 'ERE!) and being wasted. It's too damn cold to try and do anything, the weather here is making my bones freeze up and make SOUND. Sometimes I wish I was a teenager again, everyone loves reading teenager blogs, they are the most public ones, they get so many hits and it's like, what the fuck? You talk about inserting your first tampon, first sexual experience and everyone reads this in a futile attempt to relive their memories? Memories are like fleas, if you leave them there too long they start to annoy your present life. Yeah sweetie, I've seen the paedophile number rise...it's very disgusting. Speaking of "Rise", have you guys seen  urlLink  this   ? Click on the larger movie and let the frothing of the mouth begin...to quote Hyper (damn their witty writing staff!) .... is it wrong to lust after a 3D image? I guess when your boyfriend looks like Link and Spiderman combined...you really can't complain can you?  
Work Bits: One of my bosses is leaving, thus leaving us to the Corruptious Wolves...those nashing teething Marketing Managers...the rabid and easily insulted She Devil..why oh why is he leaving? Let's call him Bash, and he was a great boss. He looked like the love child of a skinny Leprachaun and a hobbit. Go Bash! I hope he changes his mind...but then again...it *is* a shit hole..

       What a fucking bad day. WHAT A HORRIBLE DAY. What an utter dissapointing, burdered day. I feel like crying. Work was busy, people everywhere, constantly infecting my very space. It was so draining, I can't even begin to describe it. I actually don't particularly want to talk about it, it's not even interesting bad. Then I got home, and I cook. I actually cook, and THEN Been and DBeanie come up, and because they are going to see Vix, they ask if CB can give back the Spinal Tap DVD he borrowed from her. This is when my evening went from relaxing and weary to weary and shit. CB managed to squeeze in every possible fucking criticism he could muster, all the godamn time bitching about how you can never find anything, how&nbsp;the house was a mess (wtf is he talking about? it's totally fine) and how SOME PEOPLE always TAKE THINGS and NEVER PUT THEM&nbsp;BACK. So in other words it was my fault. My fault for everything. Because&nbsp;he doesn't have to&nbsp;so anything, because he's fucking perfect. I hate it, I hate it so much. I am so sick of the contanst criticism, the constant pressure. YOU ARE NOT ENOUGH DEE, GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD, YOU'RE A FUCK UP WHO KEEPS FUCKING UP, SO STOP IT AND BE SMART, BE CLEVER BE FAST KNOW EVERYTHING.&nbsp; 

In the end though, it's just a little blow up, which goes intoa&nbsp; mid blow up...because CB is in a really bad place right now, because he can't think straight because he is sick. All of these horrible things... Exorcise the godamn demon....arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh. I make nice Red/Green Chicken Curry. I forgot the sugar this time tho. &nbsp;

        urlLink I Just melted in one...  
 
I don't know how to explain it... it was like heaven. And the best part is that although you hold it under the hot tap into the bath for heaps and heaps of bubbles, you are still left with a crumbly handful of soap, that I lathered my chest and arms in, I felt like a fucking rockstar. And it was relatively cheap... man I can't endorse it enough. Go Ma Bar! Hey for mum's birthday I should get her one.. hmmm...

       I hate sweet potato. I actually have overdosed on the stuff this afternoon. Last night my whole body was begging me to eat healthy, to drink water...to salvage the remains of my wasted body. But somehow, eating green chcken curry washing it down with coconut juice and a spliff...well I was unconscious by 10:30pm. The night before, it was&nbsp;showdown at Forrester's back room, this pub in Surry Hills, (we got lost thanks to CB, it cost $9 for the cab...I am secretly glad since the Fouveox (sp?) Street uphill is murderous) we spent some time there, caught up with the old crew, then Been wanted to go home, and since it was a free lift, I went with her and CB stayed. He came home with Vixs and OJ, and they woke me up, so I stayed up with them till 6:30am playing video games, and I realised that OJ is a  very  good Ivy. She scared me.&nbsp;So much so that today, I spent an hour trying to finish Very Hard arcade with&nbsp;Ivy&nbsp;(to&nbsp;catch up)&nbsp;and uh...I only got up to Cervantes before I&nbsp;realised what a waste of time it was. I hate playing hard games, it's not really fun unless you are fighting a human. I hate CPU's >:( But still...OJ only knew her hand to hand combat...she wriggles like a worm on a hook when I took out the big moves...why is all this important? Well it's not, but I guess it's something to do. To try and better eye and hand co-ordination? 
GOD I am tired, and it's because I've been trying to clean this house, so far it's been ok, just time consuming, I wish I had one of those magic wands...flick! and it's clean...yes. This world is so boring without magic. Speaking about boring...I watched Mean Girls yesterday afternooon with Been...hahaha. What a depressing movie. I don't know, it's really bizarre how you see these evil girls try and ruin each others life for sport...it's really fucked up. Why do they care so much about appearances? It's just a look, it doesn't say anything about a person...but in their world I guess since they have absolutely no soul, I guess it's all they've got. The movie was strong in some scenes, weaker in others. The main character was annoying and not very strong...she totally swallowed the lie, blah blah. In other words it was a reflection on the weaknesses of women...so? I mean I'm sorry but I see that shit  everyday.  When I go to see a movie, I want solutions, struggles, not someone getting trampled by their own bitterness or eagerness. I can just sit on a bench at Broadway Mall and see it for myself. Anyhoo, PurpleSlut isn't saying anything on her journal anymore, apparently something huge happened. Damn, and here I was thinking that she would spiel...oh well. I'm going to clean the inside of my computer now *sigh* it never ends...this sea of dirt and dust....how I loathe you!
