      Groups. Cliques.  Call them what you may.  This social grouping seems to dictate peoples lives.  I can pretty much get along with anyone no matter what "group" they're in.  As long as theres that "click" between our personalities.  I have so many friends from so many different groups that they all seem to blend into one from my point of few.  The more I hang out with different people the more I find how much alike all of us are.  Not to erase anyones indiviuality, we're all different, but we all have feelings.  Although describing it as feelings doesn't really seem to cover hardly enough of what I'm talking about. For a time now I've been what I like to call a drifter.  I don't necesarily fit into one "group" and thats my goal in life.   Where do I fit in?    Anywhere I want.   Whats the point of never exploring who people are, including yourself.   I want to effect people and I want them to effect me.   We all learn from each other and I want to learn as much as I can about people and relationships because thats what makes up our lives. I'm not punk. I'm not a prep. I'm not a dork. I'm not emo.   I'm ME.

      Blogs.  There a pretty new thing for me.  I mean I used to have one of those "buddy profiles" but I never knew what to do with it.  Ever since someone intruduced me to blogs I've wanted one of my own.  The only thing is is that as soon as I'd get to writing a post I realized I didn't wanted anyone to read what I was writing.  In Led Zepplin's song "Ramble On" it says  "Mines a tale that can't be told.  My freedom I hold dear."   Thats kinda how I feel about my life.  I need some secrects.  I need to keep something to myself.  Something thats mine and only mine.  My freedom I do hold dear.  You know that little part of me that no one can see, or at least no ones been able to get out of me or figure out... yet.  But I find myself reading other people's blogs, people's blogs that they freely invite other people to read.  Like they are dying for someone to understand them. And I've read peoples blogs that I probably shouldn't be reading, because we don't see things the same.  But I can't help myself, I get curious, and I want to see their point of few even though I still don't understand them at all.  And I've read people's blogs that I don't even know.  I find blogs extremely intriging no matter whos behind them. I don't know why I want a blog if I don't want people to read what I'm writing.  Maybe I want to be intriging too.  I'm a living contridiction.   I feel the need to express a little bit of  whats unspoken . Cuz whats unspoken is usually what makes you who you are.  I've got a good idea who I am but does anyone else?  All I know is that I'm  FREE .   Maybe too free.    I won't advertise my feelings, my soul.  But if you find this blog.  Read it and take from it what you may. Just takeitin.

      I have all this noise in my head and yet the air around me is still.  My thoughts need to flow into my actions, but there are few opportunities to  move .  I need a temporary conclusion, an ending, some sort of closer, or just a brand new distraction to guide me away from these idle day.  I can't think about the past anymore.  I can't have these thoughts clogging my senses and leaving me numb.   I need to  live.    Something has got to happen soon.  Something good, and hopefully nothing worse than the nothingness I feel.  Sure theres the occasional moments of surprise and contentness here and there.  Like when someone who never paid attention to you before suddenly decides to speak and look in your direction.  Hopes of a new bond settles in the bloodstream for awhile.  Or when you spend hours in a car talking to a long time friend about our changing lives.  It instills a wave of comfort because someone sort of feels the same bittersweet pain.  But these thrills never last too long these days in this summer.  What happen to life being one big thrill all blended in itself?  The most priceless piece of art you can find.  But then I remember that my life wasn't always so sharp and fresh.  I had my dark times early on.  Worse than just this  busy silence .  It will pass. And the hope in me for a new day rings true.  I'm restless and I'm waiting ...  I'll be  ready  to hear a new rythem come, rolling over this stillness and chassing it away.
