       Hey Everyone,  I am just writing a few extra notes about our trip. We have purchased a laptop computer and will be taking it with us so that we can keep in contact with our great Canadian companions. We have also bought a digital camera so that we can show you the pictures and videos of our Korean life. I will try and answer emails the best I can, but the best idea is to become a member of bloggers and comment on my entries. Thanks!  Have Fun!  Matthew

       Hey Everyone,  I have created this blog to allow you to view and read about my life as a pro, no not a professional hockey player, but as a professional in the area of education. Leah (my wife for those who have forgotten that I am married) and I will be heading for Seoul, Korea on August 24th and start teaching children English on September 2nd after a couple days of orientation. This means I have to end my time as a professional mover for now, but have been offered the job when I get back if there is a position.  This summer I ended up working for the best moving company I have ever heard seen. We are so good. So some of you are saying ‘if there is a position’ I will get my job back. Well two guys were hired only one week before me and one of them is gone already. I am gone after only 4 months of working so there is a chance that I could end up working there again. Anyway, the biggest problem I am moving and the company is too booked to help me. Believe That!! Leah is ready to move on from her job of working with special needs children at the respite home after a full three years (but I think it is the staff she works with). Her passion is children and English. What a concept we will be teaching children in Korea how to speak English. Leah has been a huge inspiration for me in going after what I want. After being cut from the varsity v-ball team in my fourth year I almost crashed, but she reminded me that there was more to live for than just sports (if anyone knows me, you know this is a GIGANTIC accomplishment). Leah is amazing and more of you should get to know her better than you do.  Well for my first blog I am impressed, a quick update on my life and promise to attempt to do a weekly blog where y’all can check up on me. The title of this blog has two meanings if you cannot figure it out. I work for a moving company and I am moving jobs and countries.  Have Fun!  Matthew
