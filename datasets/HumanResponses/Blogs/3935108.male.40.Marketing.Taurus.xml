       News reports yesterday confirmed that some banking call centres screen calls and respond faster to those with higher account balances. You know the words "please don't hang up; your call is important to us..."?  &nbsp;  This is somewhat disturbing to me. Not the fact that they are doing this. I totally endorse this not only for banks but all institutions that use call centres. I have, infact, helped in the creation of "client tiers". Afterall&nbsp;the commonly held 80/20 rule must apply. So why would the top 20 clients in any business not be treated with some special favours?    But therein lies the rub.  Are larger account balances truly the measure of a clients worth? I would hope that the banks would use a broader metrics that included things like the number of other services accessed by the customer, the number of years with the bank (loyalty) or at the very least the total amount of fees paid to-date!  &nbsp;  It is highly possible that the reports were simplified by the PR Dept/media to make it easier for consumption. And I sure hope so - I would hate to be the last call picked up based on my account size!  &nbsp;  Vee

       I was driving yesterday and listening to a radio talk show. The show's host had an interview with a church leader, a journalist turned minister. The guest was recounting his experiences in Africa and contrasting them to those in North America. Although I do not have the transcript from the show, the guest was lamenting at how  churches are shrinking in North America  vs growing at a rapid pace in Africa.     &nbsp;   That got me thinking. Where does spirituality, religion, "the desire to connect with a higher being" fit in   urlLink  Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs   ? The link shows us that that spirituality is part of the "safety needs" and also part of the "self-actualization".         Some faith based organizations put spirituality above self actualization in a modified version of Maslow's theory.     &nbsp;   It is understandable that with the turmoil, growth and changes occurring in the continent of Africa, society is turning to religion for safety. As such we can, generally speaking, place society in Africa around the "Safety Needs" of the Hierarchy. Consumer driven&nbsp;society like that in North America is obviously in the "Esteem Needs" of the hierarchy. If&nbsp;Maslow's theory is correct, then&nbsp;North American society is not in the "Self-actualization" stage yet.&nbsp;Obviously evidenced by the&nbsp;shrinkage of churches.      If you don't know - my solution to every problem is Marketing. And this is no exception.      And so I thought, marketing as a concept converts needs into wants. This process, in effect drops the product being marketed from one level in Maslow's hierarchy to a lower level. From "Safety" to "Psychological" level, from "Love" to Safety" level. This&nbsp;makes the product a basic need as opposed to a want. &nbsp;Eureka! And that is the solution! Faith-based organizations need marketers to drive sprituality from "Self-actualization" down to "Esteem" or even "Love". That is of course, if they want to grow.

       One of the basic tenets of CRM is that the consumer will want to communicate with the brand (corporation) and build a relationship.     &nbsp;    However, experience shows that the communication is hardly&nbsp;two-ways. The&nbsp;brand&nbsp;is almost always burdened with the communication.&nbsp;And that in my opinion is because I have yet to&nbsp;meet a consumer&nbsp;(outside of the industry) that can "relate" with a brand. Sure consumers can be loyal to a brand, sure they identify with the "lifestyle" promoted&nbsp;by the brand; but to develop a relationship (two-way communication) is a concept beyond the average consumer .     &nbsp;   As a consumer, why would I want a relationship with Maytag? Beyond the point of ensuring that the brand (corporation)&nbsp;lives up to its&nbsp;warranty obligations, I see no reason to develop&nbsp;and maintain a communication with Maytag. This desire also diminishes with the value of the product in question. A relationship with Tide or Colgate? I think not.&nbsp;And I am not alone. I will add the fact that I am loyal to every product mentioned here.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   An extention of this thought process would make the millions spent by Lever and P&amp;G to develop and implement a CRM system a total waste. Wouldn't a direct marketing / brand re-inforcement program be more cost effective? &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Vee &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
