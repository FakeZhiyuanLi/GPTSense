      im sitting here feeling mighty strange i hope my boo is ok :(  well me and ryan both wasnt feeling well today we chilled most the day and night, he wasnt to bad today i am going to miss my lil buddie when he goes away with his daddy he has been a big part of my life the last few years never thought a lil kid would change my life but he sure did, but hopefully i will get to visit with him when he comes to see his auntie amber and his grams next door to me,  change of subject_lol online life hasnt been that great for some reason, i guess cuz it summer and everyone is going places and doing things and i never catch many peps online. but it sucks i never really thought how the internet is a big part  of my life either i am always  on this computer most the time, i guess its just  way easier  to talk and find friends then going out in the real world but i have many friends but choose not to do much with them all , because either they are drinking , or smokeing weed or just plain not doing any thing that interests me, most the time, id rather sit home online and talk to  my boo . play trivia , cyber with pete (lol) chat with oreo or pick on xan:P or do unknown things to virgo and crazeeee (lol)  just  seems like ya'll have become my family online (thanks) much luv ya'll for haveing me in your life,  yall rawk, truly helped me threw things and u didnt even know you did by just being my friend and hanging out with me, ((hugs)) well im a bit sad, kinda thinking about family and how i miss my mother and grams,,.. wishing i had one last time with them to just talk and tell them say i love them and miss them and how they rasied me *great* and im thankfull for all they done for me in my life! i feel that i was robbed from saying by to my mother*shurgs*  god must have had a reason *i assume* but i still think things were not right of my mothers passing and i have nightmares still till this day! and always probly will :( well enough of  that well noone really knows anything about me or my life and now those who read this will know some things they probly would have never found out if it wasnt for this,  but i think i will keep writeing in this , it lets me say what im feeling even though i dont want the world to know but  cant noone take me down or my pride so whatever lol i wish boo would let me know he is ok, sheesh im worried  here  and cant do nothing about it, well i must end this and go see whats going on in the trivia world probly nothing ,like the last past week lol peace luv and chicken greese C

whiter then white lol, the sun runs from me lol. anyways , i took ryan to mcdonalds today he was happy to get the toy from the happy meal *cheesy kid* but he is my lil buddie. he is a great kid,most the time. well he is sleeping now,its late and my dsl was susposed to be shut off today but its still on, yeah im miss my dsl *pouts* but ill get online back in a few days or weeks im not sure what im going to do,about internet,im not sure i even want to get it back, i can check email at work, but ill miss playing on line and trivia and all my pepz on here. theres one person i am missing really badly, but i guess the person either dont wanna talk to me nomore or is just upset with me, or who knows what is going on, i dunno but yeah i just hope the person dont just forget about me, *pouts* thats what always seems to happen to me, my friends or love ones just leave me,in the darkness of a corner and i dont hear from  them  ever again. sad but true, thats why i dont let my self get close to anyone, i shy away from every one alot becasue im scared to be hurt,and it never fails i always do. well i seen my ex bestfriend today i havent seen her in 6years or so, what a shock,and strange feeling to see her and sit a talk for a hr or so she has 2 kids and 2 in  the oven, but she seems the same person she alwyas has been beside no drugs or smokeing or drinking, which is good for her kids,but other then that she seems the same person she was *shurg*' i miss my best friend *pouts* but she was not the best friend i thought she was and i went my own way in life and she went the wrong way lol. the way i didnt like and the things she did i didnt care for,so thats what happen to are friendship,lol anyways thats a whole story i could write about her and our friendship and probly end up with a book lol ,would be very interesting too .lol man i cant stop thinking of someone,always on my mind,and i dunno what your doing or how u are i leave mess and text but nothing in return,so i

in my back yard a few hrs a day id get burnt like last year i was so burned my sister was mad cuz she went tanning and paid and i got free sun lol, was funny she even tried this sun cream stuff and it turned her orange lol, she told me to try it and it didnt turn me orange it help me get even darker she was even more mad lol and me and my brother made fun of her becasue she was orange, my neice and

      THIS IS SOMETHING I WROTE AWHILE AGO I JUST THOUGHT ID POST IT IN HERE, ITS FROM  2 YEARS AGO WHEN I GOT CHEATED ON, *SHURGS* :( I AM GOING TO ADD OTHER THINGS IN HERE ALSO ....  There is no one who can cure the pain I behold Not one thing that could smooth the jagged edges of my    heart My soul is torn to pieces as I  think of all I've been    through I don't understand why I'm put through this day to day Selfish it may be, but i don't believe I deserve to cry    these tears Even my wonderful dreams only make me frown For they are only dreams If i could wish just one wish it would be to dissappear for   all eternity I'd wish to be spared a chance to end this life of only    misery No angels are watching over me No blessings are upon me Every great moment has been wasted  I am hurting For why can't you just sentence me the end of life Death Couldn't even cure this ache inside I suppose..

      how i feel is how i feel no matter what these feelings will  be as they are. being happy, being sad it's all the same just the depression takes over and bringing a smile upon this face has become a difficult task. all the joy that comes never makes up for the dissappointments. these tears take over, and just won't stop. whether this life be wonderful or it be horrible, i'll always be  broken inside. to be happy, i try, just know that how i feel is how  i feel. can't fight it, it's a natural thing. tears, go away.
