       Guess I should get my butt in gear and start using this webpage!  I had my 32 week check up today. So far so good. Still thinks the baby is breech...(oh no!) but we scheduled an ultrasound just to be sure. The ultrsound is on July13th and my Drs appt following that on the 15th. (Or as I like to say...D-day) If Peanut is breech at that time, I go in for a casearen during the first week of August. Since Peanut is a BIG baby....won't make too much difference....for him/her.....Also the scale from the last Drs appt was wrong so I didn't gain as much weight as I thought the last time....thank God! So this week showed I had lost weight! The heartbeat is a bit slower...now down to 146...from 150....So what happens to the Old Wives tales now???? That is about it from Peanut.....  Craig and I are still finalizing the tournament plans. It is hard when he works nights...and all we do is run around all day. Tomorrow he is off though, for 8 days. Things are coming together very nicely...tons of great (amazing I should say) prizes!! I wish I could play this year!  Did I mention that I was done work? Well I am. Summer of Lian started Monday....we will see how long it will last!  Cheers Leelee

       Hope you voted, Lian and I did at 1pm today and now we wait for the results.  As of now Liberals ahead, but we haven't left the East Coast, let's see how the make out in Quebec and of course the turning point is Ontario...now that will make it more interesting.  Check out:   urlLink www.thestar.com   urlLink www.cbc.ca   urlLink www.ctv.ca   Will post winner for Nipissing-Temiskaming tomorrow probably after my Physio appointment.

       Lian and I went out last night to Moose's for a Stag/Doe for Dean Devouno and Cindy Best.  Cindy went to school with my brother Scott and I went to school with her older borther Bob.  Dean is a teacher at West Ferris, so it was good to see some of the teachers that are still there.  Damn, it's been 15 years since High School...we're all getting old.  The next week will be crazy...getting ready for The Cooley but starting Wednesday I've got 8 days off which will be a great luxury.  I don't think I've been off for that long since we hit Whistler 2 years ago.  Of course the moment Lian goes into labour I have been able to secure 2 weeks so that will be great to take time and bond with the new addition, boy or girl.  Wallace out...

       10 o'clock...name change...have to remember to say it correctly, new company direction, new name, new attitude.........alrighty then.  No more Onlink, no more Ontelcom, no more Ontel...we are now officially  urlLink Ontera  and we launched this morning.  As some of you already know we 'formed' an alliance with Telus a couple of months ago and to show everyone we are moving in a new direction, expanding services, the company has chosen to change the name to  urlLink Ontera .  Bottom line, my name is still Craig and I am still your 'Chosen One'....lol...  Wallace out.

       So...headed to the clinic last night, probable and more than definite sciatica in my lower back.  I'm heading for x-rays this morning and then start some physiotherapy treatments, no chiro as that could agrevate the problem.  The x-rays are to rule out possible disc problems and to give a heads up to physio team to look for possible disc issues.  If they think there is, I may have to go for an MRI.  I'm praying it is not degenerative disc disease, or surgery is needed.  This has been happening off and on over the years but not this bad.  This will be the first time going to physio and after reading some articles online it sounds like this is the best route.  Wish me luck.  Wallace out.

       My back is killing me...I've always had some issues with my back, I remember actually taking the last half a hockey season off when I was younger because I hurt my back and it has never really felt right after that.  Now that Lian is pregnant, I tell her it's sympathy pains...of course as a man we get the standard answer of "You can never feel what this is like", well let me tell you, when the pain shoots down my leg, I know what that feels like.  The other problem about this problem is that I'm actually playing half decent golf and sometimes great golf.  I'm hitting greens, got my feel back on the short game and hitting my new driver alot better.  So I need to hold onto this feeling for the next two weeks and then the season should be done as we get ready for the baby.  I want to hit the clinic tonight and get a note to start seeing the chiropractor again, maybe even massage thearpy.  If it's available, I might as well take advantage of it.  Wallace out...  ps. I'm typing this at work, while laying on the floor...lol...not...

       Monday is just around the corner and we will either have a new Prime Minister or the same old one...  In Nipissing-Temiskaming with a population of just over 87,000 we are looking at five candidates they are   urlLink Fluri, Dave  (New Democratic Party)     urlLink MacLean, Ross  (Canadian Action Party)     urlLink McDonald, Al  (Conservative Party of Canada)     urlLink Rota, Anthony  (Liberal Party of Canada)     urlLink Wilcox, Les  (Green Party of Canada)     The front runners are Al McDonald and Anthony Rota.  Now from what I know, Al was our MPP when Harris left, he owns a local cab company, donated space to a soup kitchen and was heavily involved with our local Heritage Festival.  As for Rota, he works for The Nation Research Council....that's it...and has been whining about people taking down his signs.  If you head over to  urlLink baytoday.ca  their section on feedback and commentary is getting to be a little far fetched.  Both sides are extolling the virtures of their respecting candidates.  And also a little rumors, some even pointing to slander.  Who am I voting for, I'm leaning towards NDP.  I like  urlLink Fluri , he can talk to you in a way that doesn't give me the feeling he's reading from cue cards.  I want to see equal access to healthcare, no privatizations, some in-roads made in regards to the environment, and above all the rebalancing of the tax system;  As 'official' middle-class, I'm getting screwed over everyday.  So that's it, get out and vote, if you don't you have no reason to complain.  Wallace out...

       So...Mickleson three putts for a double on 17, Goosen is can't miss from under 18 feet, and getting up and down from everywhere...it's the same way I felt when Len Mattiace was making eagles at Augusta, there was no way he should have been a clubhouse leader, and then bite off what's left of my nails praying Wier makes that 8 footer on 18 to tie and force a playoff.  They say the US Open is there to find the best golfer, well in this year's case, and the last couple, it's not the best, it's the luckiest.  Goosen couldn't hit the broad side of a barn the last 9, didn't deserve getting up and down from jail twice in the last three...  Oh well, we're only 4 weeks away from The British Open and new set of rules.

       Starting Friday it will be a busy two weeks, we are heading to MacTier this weekend with a stop in Bracebridge to see our friends Karen and Tyler who are getting married on the 26th, then over to Lian's parents for a quick Father's Day visit, then home Sunday night.  I start a wild ride at work of 9 consecutive days and this all leads up to our charity tournament for Jon Cooley on July 3rd.  Check out the site  urlLink here.   Also starting June 30th, I have managed to switch a weekend around and have 8 days of in a row...so I can run around for the tournament and get things organized and then rest for a couple of days after that, and play in the East Side Mario's golf tournament on the 5th.  Lian will be able to relax also, she will be wrapping up at Bay Produce next Saturday and then onto maternity leave.  Wallace out.....(blatent ripoff from Seacreast...)

       This is my first message...so bear with me. It was not a good morning for me as I forgot to take my vitamin (The Dr. kindly reminded me at the appointment this afternoon) so my morning was awful. I had the worst dizzy spells of my life...complete with spots! Not fun. Thankfully Craig and Brent came and got me from work at noon, so I could sit longer and relax.  Then the appointment came....My low iron was the problem with the dizzy spells in the morning...(Ladies always remember to take those damn vitamins!) Then came even better news. Peanut is breech. Well today he/she is breech. The little darling is so active that will probaby change (Keep fingers and toes crossed!) but the Dr just wanted us prepared for it. The best news I saved for last...since he did also. I am 31 weeks pregnant but the baby measures what a 33 week fetus is.....That is right. Craig is a dead man. So if I have a c-section I need to have it done the first week of August. If the baby turns (which your all crossing your fingers for me) it will be anytime after that. So I am due in August. You pick the date and Peanut will try his/her hardest to aim for that date.  This of course also means that Peanut is soooooo smart already...since he/she is go big! Trying to make it easier for Mommy to make it thru the summer. (Well maybe "easier" isn't the word I should use here) I did have to laugh though, cause as the Dr is explaining how I can be 31 weeks and Peanut is 33 weeks...his example was just this...."Well look at Craig...he is a big guy!!!" Funny, but Craig is still a dead man...when I am able to walk!  Cheers! Leelee

       Starting Thursday is the 104th edition of the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.  Now everyone has their favourites, I'm pulling for Wier, Mickleson and Woods.  Today I also found out that I was invited to play with guys from the radio station in the upcoming East Side Mario's tournament on July 5th, and I can't forget about our 3rd Annual Jonathon Cooley Memorial Golf Tournament on July 3rd, it should be a crazy weekend.  And we are heading down to MacTier this weekend and have a game lined up with Lian's Dad on Sunday morning...would it be politically incorrect if I whipped the Father-in-law's ass...lol...I'm sure Lian's Mom will be reading this...  Appointment at our OB/GYN was moved until tomorrow, so update on that coming later...  Wallace out.

       Sunday morning, traditional BLT sandwhiches, a quick type-up of a Rock Flash for The Fox and then off to record...the rest of the day, it's laundry and cleaning of the nursery.  Thursday our friends Dan and Sue gave birth to a baby girl, Madison Jane Garagan...Danny loves to say "MJ" like the girl from Spiderman, I told him if we have a boy, we'll name it Peter Parker Wallace and they'll be destined to be together...lol...  Our class at the hospital went well yesterday, Lian 'kinda' made it through the day...she turned green only once, got sick once, and was only confined to a small space for about 5 minutes...I guess we should be looking forward to a fun ride when she is admitted for the birth...lol..  Lian is going to learn how to post a comment and then she can 'make fun' of me...lol...

         Time for the  urlLink weekend  and a little work on the house.  I have be trying for over a week to motivate myself and get going on the the nursery and this is the weekend to do it.  Not only that but we are taking our last prenatal class at the hospital tomorrow morning, running from 9 to 2...  And if I'm good, and get a lot of the work done, I may try to sneak a round in on Sunday night.

       Today is a busy day.  First thing this morning we took Sophie in for a vet appointment.  Just a 2 year checkup, get some more Sentinel (a heartworm medication) and also to check her urine.  Over the last 6 months, she has had a few accidents around the house after laying down (including one last week on my shirt while I was laying of the couch).  Her dip-stick test came back normal, as we thought it could be a urinary tract infection, the vet is completing a sediment test (can you believe $25 to dip a stick and spin some pee...).  We think it may have to do with her over-excitedness (if that's a word), and we are going to monitor for the next little while, and make sure after a playing session she heads out for a pee-break before hitting the bed or laying down.  This afternoon we are out for our third ultra-sound.  A couple of weeks ago, our doctor told us that he thinks the baby is large and that he really wanted to see the size, so we booked another ultra-sound to be sure.  Everything else is coming along great, heartbeat is strong, but the fundal height (an estimation of the gestational growth) showed the baby ahead by a couple of weeks.  I told Lian that the kid will be 12 pounds, and her reply was that if it was, the moment she could walk right, she was going to kick my ass....lol...  So that's it for today, all that and I have to cut the lawns so it will be a busy "Hump Day".  Wallace out...

        It tough to like Monday's, especially after working 7 days in a row...but I've come to look forward to the two consecutive days off and this week is even more exciting than usual.  Tomorrow is our Station's fundraiser for the Roger's Radio Childrens' Fund, it is sponsored by Casey's and I'm lucky enough to be playing (free entry as I'm a 'personality'...lol..) with the Sales Manager, James from the station.  My brother Brent is also playing and just happens to be one of the managers from Casey's, so it should be a good day.  Remember, "Your worst day on the golf course is still better than your best day at work"...  Amen Brother.

       I love it when it rains while I'm at work, and it's even better when it happens on the weekend.  If I have to suffer and answer calls all day then nobody else should be able to enjoy the weekend...yes I know, that's evil, but to each his own.  As long as 4pm tomorrow it's bright, sunny and 25 degrees...then I become a happier and more mellow person.  Lian and I are off to Harry Potter tonight, I'm actually looking forward to the latest chapter.  I'm sure a couple of times I'll need Lian to tell me about things that are happening.  How else would I have known what 'Muggles' were...I'll post a review tomorrow.  Later.

       Well I've worked out the kinks and we have now entered the age of blogging, to the many relatives and friends out there that may not know what that is I will try to sum it up quickly.  Blogging is the online practice of being able to post information quickly, they call it 'push button publishing', a way to get your voice heard on the internet.  It started small and has grown over the last few years.  I am using templates and posting using the free services of  urlLink www.blogger.com .  I found the setup and ease of use the quickest to learn.  So that's it, if I want to update about Lian, Peanut or Sophie...I just open a window and it will upload, format and post my thought in just mere seconds.  It will also archive past posts, and I can even upload photo's...the possibilities are quite endless.  You can even leave comments and I will get an email to let me know when someone has left something...another great little service.  Have fun and now I can really say, 'Check back often'...  TTYS...

       Our friends Karen and Tyler were up for the night on Sunday after driving up from Bracebridge.  They hit the road earlier tonight just before I took off to work.  They brought along their Daughter Mackenzie, and it was fun to see what is in store for us, and especially for Sophie;  She was beat this afternoon and Lian mentioned that she looked bored with her tonight, I guess she should watch what she wishes for, soon there will be another small body in the house.  Speaking of small bodies, we are on schedule for 3 and a half weeks.  Lian and I attended her appointment this morning and she is going to have a blood test tomorrow (Tuesday) at the hospital.  Physio for me at 8:45am, I will be cutting back to once a week and will continue with the stretching and basic trunk exercises.  I have tried really hard to cut out bread, pasta, cheese and milk and have been really successful.  I am now the King of Turkey Wraps, salads and Chocolate flavoured soy berverage...although we had a pizza from Greco's on Saturday night...a man does have weakness for a certain deluxe once in awhile.  Hope you liked the pictures, I hope to have more up soon.  Wallace out.

In other news, it is Lian's brother Rob's birthday today. He has turned 28. "Robbie Joe" (I know that will get his attention) is working out in Vancouver at the  urlLink Four Seasons Hotel .

       Rain + Shadflys = Wet stinky piles of dead shadflys.......that's not good, but it seems to be tailing off and it appears this years infestation is done.   Lian had her appointment today with our OB, and the baby has a) Officially turned, b) Is still large and c) five weeks away from breaking out. That's good news all around.   The baby's room is 95% complete, I need to hang a couple of gift quilts that are way too nice to use. All the clothes are washed and sorted, and we are set to go.   Lian's Cousin Jodi, her fiance Brad and her Aunt Doris are coming up this weekend. So it should be a fun time. Can't wait to get them on the Heritage Railway and carousel. Gotta get a picture of Brad riding the miniature train.   Wallace out.

       Well, we just got back from my final (I hope) ultrasound and there is good news all around! The baby isn't breech! Yeah! I knew that before we went in I was just hoping they would confirm it. Peanut is still a big baby, and just so you know, it is a Wallace....short in the legs with a large upper body. Guess we will wait to see what the Dr. says on Thursday....If he/she has a big head...I might be wishing for a ceasaren!  Craig is still in tons of pain with his back. Although he always feels great after his physio appts. Tomorrow he sees Dr. Leckie again...don't know how that will turn out.   Sophie got her hair all cut off today. So she is now resting....pretty dramatic for her...hopefully she will start to eat now that she is a bit cooler...Thank God for the air conditioning...Sophie and I would be nasty women!  I think that is it. I should have more on Thursday. Then the waiting begins....As if I wasn't anxious already....  Cheers  Leelee

       Work is dragging along the last two days, I can't walk 200 yards without pain, Lian wants to push the kid out now...time seems to be standing still, they call them "The dog days of Summer", but it's without the heat (which is a good thing).  Two physio appointments this week, some progress with the stretching, and range of motion is good.  The pain is only happening when I walk, so it could be a pinched nerve or a narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis).  I want to get a CT scan to rule out that and an MRI to see if tissue damage and/or nerve damage is happening.  The first word from the x-rays are a grade I, almost grade II  urlLink spondylolisthesis  (nice little animation there)...but sitting and laying down are not a problem.  I have given up golf for the rest of the summer, and we'll see where the treatment and new prognosis is heading.  As one friend said "It's got to hurt a lot if you've stopped golfing"...you're preaching to choir Brother.  On a better note, we have almost completed the baby's room.  The crib is together, the dresser moved in, old books and stuff cleared out.  We have sorted the clothes and the kid is set for sleepers for ever...they should make everyone wear these until they are 10 (it would really cut down on the costs...lol...).  As we don't know what we are having, it's hard to get outfits at this time so sleepers until we find out and I'm sure we will find clothes as time goes on.  That the update for Friday, have a great weekend.  I have blinds to put up and Lian has baby clothes to wash.  Wallace out...

       So...the last 4 days have been extremely hectic and just tonight I have had the chance to sit down and relax.  So I'll update what's happened so far.  We spent most of last week finishing up our running around for the golf tournament.  It happened yesterday and we could not have imagined the success that we ended up with.  There were 63 golfers and another 25 for dinner, giving us a total of 88 people.  Through the generous donations of prizes, hole sponsors and our auction items we will have over $6,000 to distribute to families with children that are suffering from Cancer.  Those costs may include money for hotel rooms for visits while on treatment, entertainment items like TV's or video games, or just a little to help with the struggle families have to make when they are fighting an uphill battle.  So thanks to all who supported the tournament, your kind contributions are known to all.  Wallace out...

We were suppose to have an appointment yesterday but it go cancelled due to our Doctor on call, who had to go perform an emergenct c-section....doesn't he know who I am...hehehe...  Looking forward to the weekend, hopefully the sun is shining...hope to play golf this weekend and not get into a fight this time...more on that next time... ;-)  Wallace out...
