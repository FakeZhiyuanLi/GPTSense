       urlLink    I'm a proud born and raised Philadelphian.  I'll argue in defense of this city 'til my face turns blue.  I even love its problems and for that reason I can't seem to leave.  It also fascinates me to know that I live only blocks away from where my Italian ancestors came to settle in the 1800s.  Along with history, my neighborhood has colorful residents like this guy.&nbsp; urlLink

      I checked out  urlLink Glowlab  today and learned the correct terminology for replicated street art is  urlLink street memes .  Plus, I now have a place to submit my photos.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     I took a  urlLink Philly Carshare  Hybrid Toyota Prius for site work today and got this shot to submit to  urlLink FUH2 .  Hybrids are amazing...I drove for over 8 hours and didn't even use half a tank of gas...I wonder how far that Hummer goes on the same amount?

      It amazes me to think that the Philadelphia street  urlLink grid  was designed in 1680s without any concept of automobile traffic.  What was invented as a luxurious way to travel has become a dominant, almost oppressive force in our everyday lives.  Commuting through clogged highways just isn't a luxury.  Parking lots and garages eat up valuable space and create dead zones of  urlLink pigeon poop  targets.  Then you figure in the gas consumption, pollution, and dirty politics associated with oil dependency.  And it is only getting worse.   SUVs are the perfect example of advertising misleading you to buy their product even though it costs you 70 bucks to fill the tank, you might rollover on a sharp turn, or kill someone in a smaller car in an accident.  I think you're an ass.  Sure, I have friends who have SUVs for work, which they need, but soccer moms in the suburbs and pimp daddies cruising South Street bought them because they were told they were  urlLink safe  and  urlLink cool .  Guess what they are neither.  In fact, in Paris SUVs are being  urlLink banned .  What business do the Parisians have improving the quality of life for its citizens anyway...maybe they need to start a war?!?

      I'm intrigued by  urlLink street art .  Stickers, graffiti, wheat pastes, stencils, whatever.  Public space is meant to be a forum for ideas and transmittal of emotions and personal realities.  Billboards and transit shelter posters offend me for their banal existence and communication of greed and consumption.  It's  urlLink your turn  to put conditioning in reverse.

      "'If man is formed by circumstances, then these circumstances must be formed by man.' (Marx, The Holy Family)   ... If all the factors conditioning us are co-ordinated and unified by the structure of the city, then the question of mastering our own experience becomes one of mastering the conditioning inherent in the city and revolutionising its use. This is the context within which man can begin, experimentally, to create the circumstances that create him: to create his own immediate experience.   ... Clearly a whole  urlLink urban guerilla  will have to be invented. We must learn to subvert existing cities, to grasp all the possible and the least expected uses of time and space they contain. Conditioning must be thrown in reverse."   urlLink read more

      It is good to know there's a place you can drink for free once year.&nbsp; Even better if it is in your neighborhood.&nbsp; I can go to Ray's birthday bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;swig down stiff drinks to the tunes of Johnny Cash and Rod Stewart and&nbsp;then stumble&nbsp;one block south&nbsp;to Pat's or Geno's (depending on whatever line is shorter)&nbsp;for a juicy cheesesteak to absorb the elixir inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then walk home happy.

       urlLink    No RNC NYC poster project  urlLink      urlLink Our City, Our Walls  is the first installment of the No RNC Poster Project. Hit up the site and see the ingenious of your fellow anti-Bushers and don't be shy, give them a donation. My personal favorite is seeing Bush in a cheerleading uniform. I've always been suspicious of cheerleaders, yeah, sorry Monica.  In other news, Republicans are crazy. Check out this  urlLink guy . Tennessee congressional candidate James Hart believes in sterilizations of minorities to purify the white race. If we don't, according to Hart, the country will "look like a big Detroit". Little does this guy know that Detriot's problems have more to do with Walmarts and outsourcing than genetics.  So, let me get this straight. The Republicans have a white supremacist looking to eradicate minorities, the Bush Administration uses  urlLink propaganda  to mislead this country, and they started a war because we can. And people still get defensive of the Hitler comparison? Here I'll make this easier for you.   urlLink    urlLink

      It's that time of year again to pack my crap and move into a new apartment. I'm looking forward to downsizing my boxes of I-don't-even-know-what that have been sitting in the basement and I've got just the place to get rid of it.  urlLink Philly Reuses  is a on-line exchange that replaces trash heaps of perfectly reusable items waiting for someone to pick-up off the sidewalk with a more sophisticated and organized way to recycle. Trash picking has become so passe anyway.  In the coming days, look for my mattress frame and christmas tree stand, not in my trash pile or in a landfill, but on the web.

       urlLink    Lansdale, PA  urlLink     If I had money, I'd buy this gem. Sue, Ric, and I drove an hour just to check out the thrift shop on the first floor to find that it was closed, but it was all worth it. I want to live, work, and play in this building, but I'd have to bring my friends with me. So, everyone grab your piggy banks, pack your bags, and let's make our own colony.
