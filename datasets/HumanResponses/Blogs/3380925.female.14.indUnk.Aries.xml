       urlLink    This is our attempt at Cassava Cake, based on the  urlLink Radical Chef's Cassava Pudding .&nbsp; urlLink     Ok. Here's one of our Culinary experiments. Our   modified kasava cake was a success. Not so bad actually. It might be a little bit sweet for some people though. So you can try it. We're thinking about cutting the macapuno balls and half a cup of the brown sugar. But it's pretty good. So here's the recipe for:  Kasava Cake  Ingredients: 3c.(or 2lbs.)frozen, grated kasava or manioc root 1c. shredded frozen fresh young coconut 1 12 oz. jar of Macapuno Balls 1/3c. evaporated milk 1 14 oz. can unsweetened coconut milk 1/3c. whole milk 1/4tsp. salt 1/2c. white sugar 3 eggs 1c. light brown sugar 1tbsp. melted butter  Mix everything together, and bake in a buttered 9 X 13 inch pan for 2 hours at 325 degrees.

      Hey this is the Microwave!! Actually, this recipe REALLY uses the microwave to cook it! Ha! So here's the Recipe!!  CaramelCoconut Chewey  Ingredients/Materials:  5oz-24pieces Chewey Caramel Candies Plastic Wrap 1c. Shelled Peanuts Microwave-safe dish 1/4 white chocolate No-stick Spray(or crisco) Shredded Coconut Microwave(duh!)  1)CHOP peanuts into small diced peices. 2)UNWRAP caramel peices. 3)put them in the microwave-safe dish along with the white chocolate peices, peanuts and Shredded coconut.   TIP*the coconut should be added to your desire, it's not needed, and you can put just a small amount if you want.  4)MICROWAVE for 1 minute 5)STIR ingredients well. 6)MICROWAVE again for 30 seconds.If you feel the caramel still needs to melt more put it back in for another 30 seconds. The texture should not be liquid, but it should be a sort of soft texture but firm because once it is spread it's going to need to harden anyways. So it should JUST be soft enough for you to knead it a little. 7)take mixture out and either put plastic wrap on microwave dish or in another. Then put crisco or non-stick spray on plastic wrap. Place mixture in dish and let harden. This shouldn't take long if the mix was at the right texture. 8)Take candy block out of dish and chop up into bite size peices. Arrange as you would like and enjoy-by yourself or with guests. Bon' Appetit'!!

      Every week I'll try to write a story and post it so you can read it. My first story is going to be "The Lost Soccerball chapter 1". This story is about a girl who loses her favorite soccer ball and has to go on an amazingly long journey just to get it back. On her this journey she meets many other creatures and strange people who try to send her off course into many unknown places.
