      i apologize for the entry i did yesterday...i know it was unethical and rude...i apologize to anna, to macky, and to whoever sent that other comment...but please understand that i do have my reasons for blurting out those opinions...i accept the consequences of what i did and i am willing to take any judgement against me...but please understand that i am only human...and that i reacted that way because i felt threatened by the fact that i wouldnt get to talk to my best friend anymore...one of the people whom i trust with everything...i couldnt let that happen...i will understand if anyone would judge me differently from now on but...if you were in that situation wherein your bestfriend would be taken away from you from his or her bf/gf...what would you have done? i did what i did because anna was being manipulated by her boyfriend...and i am tired of trying to convince myself that anna was okay...please realize that its not for my sake but for anna's...i would never even try sumthing like this if i knew anna was fine...she is suffering...she told me herself...she needs to let go...i was only trying to defend my best friend...but i went too far and i know that...so please...accept my apologies...i was only doing what i thought was right...

      Months have passed since that Saturday morning. It was a very moving experience for me, from the weekly cell meetings to the energizing Youth On Fire worship services up until the big event: the Campus Harvest in Baguio. This was a gathering of thousands of students, high school and college alike, from around Asia. I got to be part of the worship team alongside Joaquin and other friends whom I’ve met through the months that have passed. I was honored to be part of such a gargantuan religious gathering. Thousands of new believers came to Christ because of that event. Even old believers like me have become even closer to God because of this experience. I’m not saying I’m the perfect Christian now. I still have a long way to go. But I have to say that I’ve become quite a different person since my first Starbucks meeting months ago. I’ve learned to become more patient and lenient with other people. I’ve also become quite adventurous, outgoing and fun loving. Most of all, I’ve become a God-fearing person. Recently, I’ve begun to share my testimony with my classmates in hopes that they would also get closer to God. Quite a few responded positively. A little more work and I’m hoping to start my own cell group in a few months time. I have never imagined, in my wildest dreams, that I could ever become more than what I was a few months ago. Now, I look back on how I have done over that span of time and say that I am very proud of myself. I’m finally starting to be the true Christian I always wanted to be. And it all started one humid Saturday morning at Starbucks.  finally! i finished my ateneo essay...hehe....comments pls guys...thanks....khit nambabastos pa okay lang...anyways, i just got my lasalle main and benilde application kit today...astig...hehe...animo lasalle! i rili wish i would pass...i heard the exam was really hard so im studyin extra hard as well...i talked to mika last night...at least she didnt diss me na...tinulugan nalng ako...hehe...pro its alright...i missed her too much to get angry at her...hehe...anyways, thats all guys...ingatz...chill...

      It was humid that Saturday morning. I entered Starbucks, hoping to see Joaquin sitting on one of the comfortable sofa chairs the café was famous for. When I saw that he wasn’t there, I bought a Frappuccino, sat down on a sofa chair and waited. After fifteen minutes, the familiar build of Joaquin Valdez walked through Starbucks’ glass doors. He was holding a small blue and orange booklet in his hands. The words One To One were printed on its front. I was staring at the small booklet when he said, “Hey Mikko. How are you?” I said I was fine. “Why don’t we start then?” he said, smiling. He opened the book titled One To One to the first page.                                                  As Joaquin and I went through the pages of the booklet, I felt a sense of guilt going through me like a hot knife through butter. I realized that I wasn’t the Christian I thought I was. I didn’t turn away from sin nor submitted myself to God as was expected of me. It was always about me and not about others. From that moment on, I promised Joaquin and myself that I will commit myself to being the Christian I wanted to be. That very day, I started my true walk with Christ.  this is the second part of my essay...im almost done with my last part...just organizing my thoughts...anyways, im pissed off at mika na...she told me she was gona text me after she finished takin a shower...i was supposed to talk to her about sumthin important...after an hour of waiting, i called her only to find out that she went out with her brother...she didnt even care to text me that she wasnt gona call agad...grrr! asar! ah ewan...im gona try again one last time...if this happens again....i give up....anyways, gtg guys...chill...

                     Ever since I can remember, I was just a pseudo-Christian. You know…Going to church just because you have to…Craning your neck around the room looking for cute girls…Sleeping while pretending to pray solemnly…those kinds of things. I never really took going to church seriously. For me, it was just a waste of a good Sunday morning you can use for something important like sleeping, gimmicks, computer games et cetera. My parents also went church-hopping from time to time, looking for better pastors who won’t talk nonsense. We went on like this until the summer of 2004. My family was part of this new church called Victory at Fort Bonifacio which we joined a couple of months prior. This was where I met Joaquin. I’ve seen him lots of times around the church. He was one of the lead singers of the pop group 17:28 and, as his profession suggests, one of the more prominent singers in our church’s music ministry. On top of all that, he was very popular among guys and girls alike. He told me he was going to be my “cell leader”…whatever that means. A couple of days after, he sent me a text message saying that we were going to have a “cell meeting” on Saturday. I hesitated at first, but finally thought, “Sure…It’s worth a shot…maybe I’ll even get to meet a couple of cute girls.” That Saturday, I went to Starbucks to meet with Joaquin. Little did I know, though, that this thing they called a “cell meeting” would change my life forever.
