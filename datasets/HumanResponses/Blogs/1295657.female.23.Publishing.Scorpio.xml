       This is another weekend. But it seems to me that i didnt do much thing in this week, i find my days quite tedious. Went to Mid Valley this afternoon, didnt manage to get anything i like except bought some sushi from Jusco.. It was crowded in Mid Valley, i suppose is because the Sales Carnival is here now.  Time flies, another new month is coming, it's less then 24 hrs to welcome August. Am yawning*, gona sake in now.. continue my journal tomorrow. Hmm, wonder what shall i do tomorrow?

All the pictures remind me my trip to Europe 7 years back, oh my god , is like donkey years... I cant really recall everything, but the place that really mesmerize me is Italy, i love it so much...&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Jamie in&nbsp;Italy      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I just finished a piece of translation assgnment for an Insurance company. It is from English to Chinese, quite easy.when i was in the midst of doing translation, Anne ( my colleague in OSK)called me for chit- chatting, she is a pretty lady, although she is 10 years older than me,but i am glad that we have no generation gap at all. We shared almost evertyhing we like, hmm about beauty, shopping, life....  am quite happy with the friendship that i created with OSK colleagues.Some of them are really nice and friendly...  Hmm, wanna relax for a while before heading to shower.I like Yu Ann's blog so much , with a photo page, chat tag, and a lot of interesting things. I am thinking to put some into mine like pictures , but too slack to go exploring how to do it. Anyone can give me a hand?  My brother had jz gone back to Kuala Selangor, so dont think tonight I will go out for supper at Steven's Corner.Ok, tonight, i shall be watching Friends on Astro..Anybody manage to download  english version of FRIENDs or Sex and the city from any P2P?? Tell you what, i used to download Sex and the city (season one full series). I didnt realized that i have downloaded French version until i wanna watch it. Then i deleted off everything. Ever since, i never try to download any series. Poor me!

      I watched 3 movies in 3 consecutive days. One is Cantonese movie and another 2 is Spiderman2 and The Prince and Me. Here a little review on 3 movies. 1.  Heat Team  ( Starring: Aaron Kwok,Eason Chan) Typically,this movie is about 3 police inspectors, Aaron Kwok ,Eason Chan, and another young pretty lady Yumiko. Frankly, i find the story meaningless, find it tedious, i dont like the idea of whole movie. In fact, i hardly watch any chinese movie in theatre, coz me and brother have nothing to do in Genting, and there is no other choices of movies...we watched it for the sake of killing time!THUMBS DOWN!  2.  Spiderman2  Spider-Man 2 is essentially three movies rolled into one: a traditional superhero story, a coming-of-age tale, and a romance. I really like the Uncle Ben's pronouncement "With great power comes great responsibility" that inspire Peter Parker to be a super hero to save the New Yorkers life. The story is quite predictable but overall it is a good movie.For sure,Spider-Man 3 will be heading.   3.  The Prince and Me  (Starring :Julia Stiles,Luke Mably-Prince) I love seeing Julia Stiles in movies.I like her so much in Save the last dance. I even watched her in Mona Lisa Smile, but it isn't a great show though.I absolutely love The Prince and Me,and surprisingly SF loves it too!Julia Stile, as Paige an ordinary american college student .The sweet stories has begin when she falls in love with this Danish charming Prince.There is great chemistry and great chracters between them, you will really great to see them together.It is a heartwarming love comedy, worth a watch.

      This is my first time appearing as a guest blogger on someone's blog. I feel nervous, a little blank to start of with, unsure of what to say. :D I've known Midg for 4.5 years now but sad to say that we've never really had the chance to get to know each other better. It's really weird 'coz we were introduced by a common friend and that was it. We went to the same Uni. Might have been in the same class. Probably have a couple more common friends. But never really got together to have a laugh or so. And it sure doesn't help that she's now back in KL and I'm still stuck in Melbourne. So Task 1: Get to know Midg better in the upcoming weeks by constantly visiting (perhaps updating) her site. Task 2: Think of something more creative and exciting to post up here. :D

      I am going to Genting later for 2 nights with parent and brother to celebrate mum's birthday . am not into gambling, basically going there to relax, to enjoy the cool air, that's all  my plan in Genting. Not into theme park activities as i am scared of all the rides,if there is a nice shopping mall like KLCC , that will be so great.I am not into shopping in first world, as i couldnt get what i want over there. Perhaps i should catch a movie.

       I am sipping 3 in 1 Milo now, dipping soda cracker into it is really yummy. I guess i been drinking MILO for more than 20 years, i could say i cant live without it. Recall back 4 years in Melbourne, there is no any 3 in 1 MILO selling over there if i am not wrong, and i could remember i try to hide some 3 in 1 into my big luggage bag everytime i fly despite i knew that it is prohibited to bring into Aus .  I just wana try my luck, of coz it will be good that the custom dont confiscate it. I know the small amount of 3 in 1 wont last me for long, but i jz love it... Dont like the Aus Milo, its taste  is a little weird....

         I suppose to write this journal early, yet my stupid streamyx connection was down for few days. I was quite upset about the Streamyx service, and i once wanna disconnect it.. I had made heaps of complaints regarding how poor the service is, but the Tmnet people cant even give me a firm answer on how to solve the problem, they are just shirk their responsibility by tranfering my call to several department, and i have to keep repeating my problems, oh no, this is not the way, cant even achieve customer satisfaction? Where is the quality of service? They simply give me a reference number and ask me to call back to check again.. They even promised to call me back once they find out the reason.. But, what did they do?? They just did nothing, until i get piss off and forward emails to so many authorities to complain about them.... Till today i didnt hear anything from TMnet and i refused to call up coz i know there will be the same..  And, surprisingly, when i am trying to connect to internet this afternoon, it is working.... IN fact, the way they service their customer indeed let me down, i guess alot of people experienced the same thing like me.. I am talking about the services in Malaysia, there are alot of aspects that the service line need to be improved, why cant they think about how to achieve customer satisfaction? Why cant they try to make it?? Alot of why in my mind... Personally, i am quite particular on customer service.. I will be getting very piss off if i get poor service, from restaurant, shopping centre, government department.......Seriously speaking, i give majority of the services provided a Thumbs down! Poor thing isnt it?  In Malaysia, i wonder how many people are really care about providing good customer service in order to retain customer and further develop good customer relationship?? I know my complaints is endless, and i know i am being an unpatriotic person, i know i may sound offensive to some people ... But this is a fact, i cant help it!  Does it mean i should bear and grin the fact?? No, definitely not!
