       yeap... the weekends here alreadi. i always look forward to the weekend. chance to get away from work and dont feel like i owe my day to somebody else or owe some of my time in a day to somebody. i like weekends coz its my time. i choose how i wanna spend it. anything i do, be it productive or pure bumming, its me who chooses how i spend my time. nobody tells me wat do to do. Most of all.... i dont owe my time to anyone and how i choose to spend my time is sacred to me.     &nbsp;  so... we all have 7 days a week. which days do we look forward to? as for me.... as much as i hate mondays. i still look forward to it. maybe coz its a start of a brand new week and any stoopidity done the week b4 is forgotten coz.. ITS A BRAND NEW WEEK... to make things right. its also coz i get back to work on mondays and my internet. i dun have an internet connection at home. being a unconditional loving brother i am... i gave kevin my modem a couple years ago. actually i have to thank the days i had the internet cafe. it really opened my eyes to the internet. Then... after that... i gotta thank my uncle for introducing me to his fren's company. BROADBAND! .... thats the way to go man. yeap... u can say im one of the very few ppl who love my job. love coming into d office. hasnt come to a point where im lazy to go to office. never lazy to go to office. Love my office. Love my job. It hasnt always been a smooth sailing journey. Of course it had its ups and downs. There was a time that i was thinking of leaving this place coz it didnt seem like the company was gonna go anywhere and looked like it was gonna close. But, i am still here in this company. so far... this company breaks the record. i've been here for the past 3 years. even my own internet cafe oni lasted me 2 years.    &nbsp;  so thats monday... wat other days i look forward to...??? wednesdays.... i call it my CSI days. most of the time i dun like to have any appointments after work on wednesdays for fear of missing my CSI. but these days... with the DVD ... if there is really something better to do than watching CSI... i will for go CSI.     &nbsp;  then... of course there is friday.... its like the end of the week. its like 'phew ... that was quite a week'. watever u have done during the week is laid to rest. its also the day we prepare for the weekend. we find that we're more joyous at work or at skool coz we know its like that last day of torment. to me... its like the last day im contracted to somebody. its like telling my boss 'hahahaha.... by then end of the day u r no more my boss and i dont have to listen to u or do anything for u. adios amigo.... any problems DONT call me. wait for me to come back on monday then i'll listen to u. hahahahah' heheheheh....    &nbsp;  u think thats all the days of the week i look forward to....??? thats not all.... then there are days that i meet up and spend time with my girlfren, Sara Jayne. we dont get to see each other as often as we want to. so i really look forward for the days that i lepak with her. Sometimes we go out and have dinner... sometimes we just lepak at home. Sometimes we indulge.... yeap... thats the explanation of my size. Lepaking with Sara is like a completion to the end of the day. if i dont see her for the day... i feel like as though i forgot to do something like that. Spending time wit her... is like.... uumm... how do explain this? When im with her... its like im sane again. She keeps me calm.... Keeps me loose and not uptight. ahhh... here it is.... Im very 'joysome' when im around her. I LOVE YOU SARA JAYNE! (hhhmm... i wonder how manny ppl will be reading this?)     &nbsp;  yeap... so those are the days i look forward to in d week.... sound corny? too bad... these are my thoughts and they r about wat i feel.... u get ur own blog site and u 'type' down wat u feel and let the whole world read it!

      wah... so boring lah at work. nuthin to do.... damn sien lah.... and when got nuthin to do ah.. time passes like slow oni. why do we all have to earn a living ah? whoever started this money thing is a real idiot lah. wonder wat it would be like if there was no such thing as money and ppl were still barter trading. wonder how they made it in those days of old when eveveryone didnt have money. sumore now here in malaysia almost everything is useless. our earnin power here is so bad. everyone is under paid and majority of the workforce is really unhappy bout wat he or she is doing for money. and i really dun understand our malaysian employers. i mean these ppl own companies. make a whole load of profit. pay their staff peanuts. and yet... they still claim for things like entertainment allowances. or even travelling allowances... or even car maintenance allowances... and here the poor kuli who is always overworked and underpaid... gets his mileage claims cut coz its too much. im sure there are even employers who oni allow their employees to claim up to rm25 for their medical fee each month! i mean come on... i heard nowadays... just to see doctor and 3 types of medicine is alreadi rm60. wat kinda employers do we have here in malaysia? okie okie okie.. u may say that im working for a small company and in a big corporate firm those things dun happen. but dun big corporates work u to the dogs even on weekends??? and dun u think that in a big corporate if u dun come to work for 1 day they will surely get sumone else to cover for u. im sure big corporates have lotsa redundancies. here's a word of advice to everyone who is working or is gonna start working. 'work will always be there regardless if u go to work or not. and unless ur own the company urself... u're dispensable!' they can always get sumone to replace u... just a matter of permanent replacement or temporary. but then again we employees are so scared to lose our jobs. we end up working anyway for fear of being 'non-performing'.  okie okie okie... i think thats enuf of thought for a while... its just so frustrating to always be short of something. BUT... i remember those days when i was serving in church and praising the Lord with my guitar(i must say i was a very good bluffer), now at those times. it made me whole. made me complete. whenever the day seems so long. i always keep looking forward to charismatic and praise and worship. this is a personal testimony. The Lord always completes you. without Him we r nothing.   PRAISE THE LORD FOR THE PERSON I AM TODAY and FOR ALL MY FRENS AROUND ME WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME THROUGH THICK AND THIN.

      Dei (in thick indian accent) what's up with this pensive mood you've been in. Perhaps its just me but all the emails I've been getting from you gives rise to thoughts that you seem to be second guessing your thoughts and actions. I won't share with the whole world what it is that you've said that makes you think this way, but looks like something major is going on in that pretty little head of yours!   For the record, you rock ...you've always rocked since that fateful moment we became make believe blood relations. An education, or a job or even what you say isn't going to change that...unless of course you get angry with me and start spewing vulgarities at me then you might impress me a whole lot less lah! But again, let the records show that all of use who used to go camping wt. Kenny find him to be a role model like no other...how's that for validation?

      ah okies.... dun u just hate it when u're bout to sumthing on d internet and the site goes down??? like when u type a long long email and then u click send... and then the freakin site just goes down. doesnt that really irritate u? anyways... i was just posting on this site when that happen. almost sometimes tells me that maybe that email wasnt supposed to be written... or maybe that message wasnt supposed to be sent. but nvm its all good now.  anyways... im starting this thingy so hopefully i can look back at my thoughts and my actions and see wat i've done wrong and not do it again. its also like a joke lah. as i get older im sure wat i type earlier would all be like a joke like that. as i was sayin to fren the other day.... "u know... as we get older and when we look back and see how we were and wat we did when were in school, all those days seem like a joke like that but more importantly lessons we all learnt for a good good reason." im glad i did all the stoopid stuff when i was back in school coz i dun do them anymore now.  okies... so here the journey begins. i welcome all my frens to comment to me bout my thoughts and also me as i 'type' them down (see how technology has changed us?). just hope i dun hurt anyone out there....
