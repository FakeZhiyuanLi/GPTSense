      Ok, right now, I'm REALLY hyped up on like.......10 pounds of sugar and it's late at night, and I just want to get this in before I crash for the night.   One day, a portal opened between two dimensions, our universe, and the fruit universe.  In this "alternet universe" there are talking Apples, Grapes, Bananas, Lemons, Limes, Oranges, and many many other fruits and Cheese, but the Apples and Grapes are EVIL!  What they do is go from planet to planet, cutting down all the trees to take it over.  Then, when that portal opened, they tried to take over earth.  "How?" You ask.  Well I'll tell you.  They cut down all the trees, causing global warming on Mars, making it CRASH into the sun, where the source of all cheese is, making it IMPLODE!!!!!!  Thus, making earth spin so fast it swings all the humans off.  But thankfully we had the hippies to save us.  But luckily for us, THE HIPPIES SAVED US!!!!!!

      Before I go I'm just going to get this in.      Psychologists have discovered that the manner in which people eat Oreo cookies provides great insight into their personalities. Choose which method best describes your favorite method of eating Oreo's:   1. The whole thing all at once. 2. One bite at a time 3. Slow and methodical nibbles examining the results of each bite afterwards. 4. In little feverous nibbles. 5. Dunked in some liquid (milk, coffee...). 6. Twisted apart, the inside, then the cookie. 7. Twisted apart, the inside, and toss the cookie. 8. Just the cookie, not the inside. 9. I just like to lick them, not eat them. 10. I don't have a favorite way because I don't like Oreo.   Your Personality:   1. The whole thing This means you consume life with abandon, you are fun to be with, exciting, carefree with some hint of recklessness. You are totally irresponsible. No one should trust you with their children.   2. One bite at a time. You are lucky to be one of the 5.4 billion other people who eat their Oreo's this very same way. Just like them, you lack imagination, but that's OK, not to worry, you're normal.   3. Slow and Methodical. You follow the rules. You're very tidy and orderly. You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do to the point of being **bleep** retentive and irritating to others. Stay out of the fast lane if you're only going to go the speed limit   4. Feverous Nibbles. Your boss likes you because you get your work done quickly. You always have a million things to do and never enough time to do them. Mental break downs and suicides run in your family. Valium and Ritalin would do you good.   5. Dunked. Every one likes you because you are always up beat. You like to sugar coat unpleasant experiences and rationalize bad situations into good ones. You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You have a propensity towards narcotic addiction.   6. Twisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie. You have a highly curious nature. You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how they work, though not always able to put them back together, so you destroy all the evidence of your activities. You deny your involvement when things go wrong. You are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if not criminal, behavior.   7. Twisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie. You are good at business and take risk that pay off. You take what you want and throw the rest away. You are greedy, selfish, mean, and lack feelings for others. You should be ashamed of yourself. But that's OK, you don't care, you got yours.   8. Just the cookie, not the inside. You enjoy pain.   9. I just like to lick them, not eat them Stay away from small furry animals and seek professional medical help - immediately.   10. I don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreo cookies. You probably come from a rich family, and like to wear nice things, and go to upscale restaurants. You are particular and fussy about the things you buy, own, and wear. Things have to be just right. You like to be pampered. You are a prima donna. There's just no pleasing you.

      I guess I have more time than I thought.  Well, I guess I could add a little more about myself.  Somewhere it says that I'm a loner, this is true, but that doesn't mean that I don't have friends, I just prefer to be alone, and I prefer dark things over light things.  I have really sensitive eyes, even though I can't see more than 3 feet in front of my face without my glasses.  I have established several things about my life at school:   1) All my teachers hate me (No Brainer)   2) I think my teachers hate me because of my brothers   3) Half of my teachers are sexist.  I have come of with the conclusion of the last one because 3 of my teachers that I have every year always treat the girls with greater respect.  I don't blame them with the times that they grew up in (1950-60's, yes, some of my teachers are 50 years old, one is 59).  But, that's no reason to fail someone because they're a guy.  Recently a book report was due with, a biography book report.  I had accidentally picked up a "bibliography" and my teacher wouldn't except it.  Another person (a girl) had one, and it was a bibliography. 98 my teacher wrote down in her book.  Now it could be because of my brothers, and I'm still thinking on that.  Hm....Kinda stumped right now....I guess I'll go finish up my homework.    Later.

      It's been 1-2 weeks since I've began this, and so far I haven't said much.  Well, let me introduce myself, I'm James, 14 years old with characteristics that you wouldn't normally find in a 14 year old, and I live in North Carolina.  Don't be expecting posts left and right, either.  I shouldn't even be on the computer. But I do have a life outside the house.  Well, that's all I have to say for now.
