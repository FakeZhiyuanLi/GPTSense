						   I like horror movies.  I'm not really sure why.  I like them for reasons I can't really explain.  I like the special effects, the simulated gore.  The suspense leading up to the kills.  The... I don't know.  Movies about zombies are good, but I'm really a fan of slasher movies.  Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead (though that one is kind of hard to pigeonhole).  Monster movies are great too.  Jaws is one of my alltime favorite movies, though I'm scared to swim in any sort of open water, be it lake water or ocean water.  I'm not afraid of snakes, so movies like Anaconda are laughable.  I absolutely detest ticks, though.  The movie Ticks with Seth Green is nearly unbearable to watch.    When I was younger I wanted to be a special effects artist.  I looked up to people like Tom Savini and Stan Winston.  What a fun job to fabricate severed heads and trick limbs that squirt blood and twitch when lopped off.  Maybe I'm just wierd, but I thought this was quite possibly the best career anyone could have.

						   Alex is great.  I can't imagine what life would be like without him.  It is so hard to leave the house in the mornings to come to work.  I sit and think about him and Merrie all day, wishing I was home with them.  He gets so upset sometimes.  He sticks out his bottom lip and it quivers when he cries.  He smiles and laughs.  He's the best thing in the world.  He likes to watch his Baby Einstein programs.  Merrie and I put him in front of the television, either in his bouncy chair or his swing, and he sits there watching them quietly.    He naps in his bouncy chair, and he's so precious when he sleeps.  It's like he doesn't have a care in the world.  I love nothing more than to just sit and look at him.

						   Sleepovers at Rob's house were a bit different.  I can only remember one occasion when there were more than two of us there.  Usually it was just Rob and I.  He was a strange character.  Kind of a lanky and overgrown kid for his age.  He had a basketball hoop that my dad had helped him put in.  His grandmother was South American, I think.  Or maybe it was Pacific Islander.  Either way, I don't recall her speaking much english.  Rob's place was the first time I ever saw a Penthouse magazine.  It was love at first sight.  Rob had no problem talking about sex, and no shame in masturbating in front of other people.  I found that a bit odd at the time, but didn't really think much of it at the time.  We would stay up late listening to music and playing Nintendo and stuff.  He had a bunch of metal tapes that he had gotten from somewhere, but ended up giving them to me.  I think he was a poseur for the most part.  I liked metal, and I always had.  But some of his metal was kind of girly.  Like Stryper and stuff like that.  He moved away abruptly.  I was going into the 7th grade, and he just kind of up and left.  My dad used to get pissed because he'd call on the phone.  He lived two houses down from me, but used to call instead of come by.  God, that made my dad furious.  Rob would call during dinnertime and my dad would nearly die.

						   When I lived in Dove Cove, Adrian was one of my friends that I used to hang out with.  He wasn't there that long, a couple of years maybe.  His father worked for Asplundh.  We used to go over to his house and skateboard and hang out and stuff.    Rob and I spent the night at his house a couple of times.  One night we stayed up late and watched Friday the 13th:  The Final Chapter.  It scared the hell out of me.  Adrian's Nintendo was the first console game system I remember seeing.  He had Mike Tyson's Punch Out and Double Dribble.  And Super Mario Brothers 2.  We used to go over to his house and play Nintendo a lot.  He had a game controller that had a 'turbo' button.  It was good for playing Contra.  One sleepover that we had, we were wrestling and I jumped on Rob's back to tackle him.  He threw his arm back and broke my nose.  That was the first time my nose got broken.  Adrian's house had a sort of front porch area that had flower beds growing in front of it.  The flower beds had vines in them that had little white flowers on them.  He said they bloomed at night, but I never saw them.  I remember we used to drink a lot of Koolaid whenever we played.  That was always a big part of our diet.  It was no wonder we had a ton of energy.  I don't think Adrian had a basketball hoop, but I remember he played football.  I always wanted to play football because I thought it would be neat to get all dressed up in the pads and helmet.  I never played football.  I think he played baseball too, though he was in a different league from the one I played in.    When we went over to his house, he would bring his boombox outside and we would listen to JJ Fad and Sir Mix A Lot.  And DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince.  I remember hearing the song "Nightmare on my Street" for the first time.  I hadn't seen any of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but I knew who Freddy was.  The song scared me.

						   Halloween in Georgia was one of the best times of year.  The hot sticky summer was over and done with, but the days were still fairly temperate.  It never really got too cold in Georgia, but there were times standing out at the bus stop in the morning that we thought we would freeze.  At the end of October there was rain from time to time but for the most part the weather was mild.  One year I dressed up as a dracula-type skeleton.  I had a rubber skeleton mask that had a furry back to it, perhaps to indicate hair or suggest a hood.  I wore a vinyl cape and dark clothing.  It rained that year, and my mask was soaking wet.  I didn't care.  The candy haul that was generated from a trip around the neighborhood was enough to justify walking through the rain for a couple of hours.    It was a nice neighborhood, and we never really had to worry about people giving us candy that was tainted or tampered with.  Most people in the neighborhood gave good candy, too.  Sweet Tarts, mini Snickers bars and Milky Way, a double bubble gum.  Some people even gave us homemade treats.  Popcorn balls, rice crispy treats, and candied and carmel apples.  Leland dressed up as a devil one year, maybe the same year that I dressed up as a skeleton.  He had a latex mask that he had to paint himself, and it was glued to his face with more latex like a real s/fx appliance.  I really wanted a mask like that, but I was ok with what I ended up with.    Some people took the holiday fairly seriously, decorating their doors with cardboard cutouts of witches and skeletons, leaving plastic cauldrons on their porches.  Some set up elaborate graveyard scenes in their yard each year, and one industrious neighbor on the other side of the circle converted his garage into a haunted house.  Halloween has always been one of my favorite times of year.  I look back on the trick or treating we did in Georgia, and it was picture perfect.  Kids wandering the neighborhood uninhibited, unworried about strangers.  No vandals wrecking houses, no big kids chasing around or scaring little kids.  It was always a good time.

						   Adam and Keith were the two resident metalheads in my neighborhood.  Keith's house was over on the other side of the circle when I lived at 222 Morning Dove Lane.  Adam lived down at the entrance to Dove Cove.  They were always wearing cool Testament and COC shirts and stuff.  They were a couple of grades ahead of me.  I remember thinking how cool they were because they didn't care what anyone really thought of them.  They were those guys who always seemed to be getting in trouble for something.  I think Keith went to Elberta at one point.  That was the school for the disciplinary issue people.  We were threatened with it from time to time.  You want to not mess up, or you'll go to Elberta.  That type of thing.  I never went down to Adam's house even though in high school he kind of hung out with the same group of people as me.  I went into Keith's house once, though.  I can't remember why.  He had a living room that you stepped down into.  Kind of a conversation pit type thing.  I remember thinking that was really cool.  I was listening to Spiritual Healing by Death on the bus after school and that caught their attention.  They always sat at the back of the bus, and I sat near the back but far enough away in case either of them were to try to start trouble with me.  I never really had any problems with anyone in school, though.  Except for one time, I got punched in the eye for flipping off a jock.    Keith was the first person I knew who smoked but wasn't old enough to smoke.  Adam too, I think.  I remember thinking that they seemed so grown up because they were allowed to smoke.  Another one of the big things to do down south was dip, which was easier to do while you were at school.  Smoking, though, was cool.  Everyone in the neighborhood had a Nintendo, it seemed, except for me.  Keith and Adam used to go down to Ryan's house (he was a friend of mine, but he had an older brother) to play Zelda all the time.  So when they were there, we hung out in the yard pretending like we were all part of the same cool group.  At the time I was about 11, I think.  Ryan was over on the other side of the circle as well.  The bus stop was in front of his house for a period of time.  To get there, I would go left out of our driveway and down the hill.  I could ride down the hill on my skateboard after a while, but the first couple of times I tried it, I would wipe out near the end of the hill.  The hill turned left, and then Ryan's house was down on the right.  Past Ryan's house was Pat Lee's house on the other side of the road.    Jason Cihal lived on my road a couple of houses down, and Terrence Cole lived sort of across the street.  Not next to Leland, that was Scott, but the next house over after Scott's.  It seemed like a huge neighborhood at the time, and when we first moved in we were one of the last houses before the road turned to dirt.  I was driving through the neighborhood recently when I went back to visit my parents and the neighborhood seems so small now.    It was a great neighborhood to go trick-or-treating in, though.  Leland's sister Brenda dressed up as a devil one year.  She had a form-fitting leotard that was red, with a tail in the back.  She wore little horns on her head and carried a little toy pitch fork.  I would have died to have seen her naked.  It's funny how when you're a boy getting ready to hit puberty, nearly everything has some sort of sex appeal.

						   When I was in High School, our drama department did a production of the musical Grease.  Our principal was not behind this production at all, as she was a very religious woman and thought that the storyline dealt with immoral issues.  At any rate, our drama head chopped up the script sufficiently enough to appease the principal and it went into production.  Meredith Bailey was in many of my classes and she landed the female lead, which was really strange because she had never had any interest in any of the other performances the school held, and was not in any drama classes.  My friend Brad was going to play drums in the band.  The performance was going to include live music, which I don't think had been done at the school at that point.    I was in the video class, and we filmed the performance on opening night.  At one point during the performance, Meredith was wearing green capri-style pants that looked like they were painted on.  My God, it was every teenage boy's dream.  After the performance, we hung out backstage with Brad and there was an air of importance to the event.  It was as though we had just witnessed a performance at Radio City Music Hall, and not the auditorium at our high school.  It is interesting how when you are younger, things seem so much bigger than they are.

						   I went to first grade in Texas.  They were going to put me through kindergarten again because of my age, but my parents paid to send me to a private school instead.    There was a large pecan tree out behind the school, in a fenced in area along with the playground.  During breaks we would find pecans and stomp on them to crack them open.  There were honeysuckles as well.    I went to kindergarten in California.  I don't have any specific memories about living there besides the house itself.  We had a wooden fence in the back yard.  We lived in a row of houses and out in front of the house there was a fence that ran along the driveway.  There was a girl on the other side of the fence that I saw from time to time. Once, she showed me a model of a visible man that she had built.    I don't really remember the house we lived in when we were in Texas. I remember having a Transformer jet, and losing the front landing gear in the sink of the bathroom downstairs.  I remember in front of the house there was a yard, and one day I found a huge ant mound.  I steopped on it and was amazed at how many ants came out.    Our house in England had a green metal garage door.  In the back we had a garden, and a shed where we kept the gardening tools.  There was a rhubarb plant outside the door to the shed.     The bathroom window was a frosted, textured glass window.  I once kicked a soccer ball through it.  My bedroom was at the back of the house across from my parents, but at some point I was in the front bedroom too.  The front bedroom had a window that faced the driveway, and the back bedroom had a window that faced the back yard and garden.    Fritz and I went into the little corner store every day before we got on the bus.  I had a jar of coins in my room and every day I would take money from it so I could buy a snack.  I used to buy Twix, Aero and sometimes crisps, usually Bits of Pizza.    My bedroom at the back of the house had Bananaman curtains. My sheets were Star Wars.  I had a red vinyl bag that I kept my toys and transformers in.    I don't remember many times in England when it snowed, but I remember snow being on the ground when we played soccer in the fourth grade at Feltwell Elementary.  The team was often made up of fellow fourth graders, and we usually played against the fifth graders.  Jay was a fifth grader who often played against us.  He had a black jacket with blue stripes on the sleeves and he wore glasses.    Fourth grade was my last year in England.  After that we moved to Georgia.  I remember going down with my dad to sign up for classes at Centerville elementary.  That was when we were still living at Scarborough Road.  For sixth grade I went to Miller.  I don't recall if we were living at 222 Morning Dove by that point, but I know I was there when I was in junior High.    Junior High School was spent at Northside.  My friend Mike used to keep a bottle of Listerine in my locker and he would drink it in between classes.  There were a lot of fights at the school.  I went to my first dance there.  It was in the gym.  I wore a white shirt and my dad and I went out and bought me a blue floral tie.  No one danced with me.  I cried when we drove home.    There was never a time while I was growing up that I felt ashamed or embarassed by my father.  I always looked up to him, and I always wanted to be like him.    On one busride home in junior high school, I gave Ryan Avery the finger.  He hit me when we got off the bus, right in the eye.  I walked home crying, and when I got home my dad piled me in the car and we went looking for Ryan.  My dad never found him.    Ryan went to my high school.  He was on the football team.  We pretty much left each other alone in high school.  Ryan lived close to Jonathan Greene, who I was somewhat friends with in high school.  I sold Jonathan my Danelectro guitar.  I had altered the headstock and painted it black.  I always think back on that with regret.  If I had known at the time that the guitar was a collector's piece, I would never have messed it up and gotten rid of it.    I had found the guitar in Jim Swanick's basement.  One of Steve's sisters had tried to learn how to play, and the guitar was cast away along with a small tube amp, a little tweed thing.    I took them both back to Georgia with me.  The first thing I ever learned how to play on the guitar was 'Smoke on the Water' by Deep Purple.  The first song I ever played with accompaniment was 'Symphony of Destruction' by Megadeth.    I bought the red guitar from Dominick Ladolce.  My dad couldn't stand that kid for some reason.  I don't remember why.  I bought the guitar from him for $60.  It was a Shane Targa.  I had never heard of the brand before, and I've never seen one since.

						   I read through the first couple of chapters of the book I'm working on.  The story line is there, but it doesn't read very well at this point.  We're getting there, though.    I was talking to Newal Hunter today and he was telling me about how he had lived at one point in England.  As coincidence would have it, he lived there during the same time I did.    England was such an interesting place.  I looked up a map of Weeting and Brandon, and I was amazed to discover that I actually remember the rad between where we lived in Weeting and the Air Force base, Lakenheath, where I went to second and third grade, and where my father worked.    I'd like to go back there at some point.  See where I grew up.  At least for part of my childhood.  It's funny, but when we moved back to the states after the overseas assignment it was America that seemed foreign.    When we moved back to the U.S. I didn't really know anyone and I had a hard time making friends and fitting in.  I amused myself, and took to recording radio shows on my portable stereo.  I would take the tapes I had, all two or three of them, and make mix tapes of the songs I liked.  I would introduce the songs like I was a disc jockey.  A strange hobby, but it was the only one I remember having at the time.    There was a family living across the street who had a boy younger than me, but who served as a playmate of sorts.  Across the street from Blaine was a black family.  I don't remember the name of the two boys, but one of them was deaf.  That was the first experience I can remember in dealing with someone with a handicap.  We got along well.    I remember fixing his bike for him.  The front wheel had fallen off, so I bolted it back on. To him I had performed magic.  Incidentally, I was quite interested in taking things apart and putting them back together.  In fact, I was losing valuable on-air time with my radio show because my boom box was in pieces.    I don't specifically remember the events leading up to the time I set Blaine's father's tree on fire, but I do remember filling a coffee can with pine straw.  The intent was not to burn the tree but to burn the combustible items in the coffee can.    It didn't take long once the fire was lite for the can to become amazingly hot.  It got away and rolled under the dreaded apple tree, which went up in flames as though it were soaked in kerosene.    It was to the deaf boy's house that I ran for water by the bowlful.  Each douse that I gave the flaming tree with the thimble-full sized amount of water I had managed to decorate the street with did nothing to abay the fire.  I can't remember how the fire was actually put out, but I believe someone finally extinguished it with a garden hose.    There was a great property dispute later when Blaine's father attempted to make my dad pay for the damages to his singed apple tree.  I don't recall whether payment was ever tendered.

						   I seem to lose track of the days.  I know what day of the week it is, but oftentimes I forget the day of the month.  Months have seemed to run together lately.  I've gotten wrapped up in so many things at work, it's hard to remember up from down.  So many projects, so many reports, and yet so little time in which to get everything accomplished.      My book is keeping me going at this point.  I've finally managed to get a laptop from the school so I'll be able to piece the draft together.  And I'll be able to hotsync my PalmPilot so there's no need to re-type what I've written so far.    Life seems to be ok.  With so many hills and valleys, one finds it hard to remember where he's at on the journey, but I can honestly say I think I'm headed in the right direction.    I've bought another journal in anticipation of filling this one.  I'm enjoying sitting down and writing.  Many times, though, I feel like I'm just babbling on.  All the same, I find a small victory in being able to fill 38 pages (so far) with my thoughts.

						   This is not my writing, but I remember a lot of this.  I'm going to look through the site and see if there are any other 'remember the 80s' ramblings that I can relate to.     I am a child of the eighties.  That is what I prefer to be called.  The nineties can do without me.  Grunge isn't here to stay, fashion is fickle and "Generation X" is a myth created by some over-40 writer trying to figure out why people wear flannel in the summer.    When I got home from school, I played with my Atari 2600.  I spent hours playing Pitfall or Combat or Breakout or Dodge'em Cars or Frogger.  I never did beat Asteroids.  Then I watched "Scooby-Doo." Daphne was a Goddess, and I thought Shaggy was smoking something synthetic in the back of their psychedelic van.  I hated Scrappy.      I would sleep over at friends' houses on the weekends.  We played army with  urlLink G.I. Joe  figures, and I set up galactic wars between  urlLink Autobots  and  urlLink Decepticons .  We stayed up half the night throwing marshmallows and Velveeta at one another.  We never beat the  urlLink Rubik's Cube .      I got up on Saturday mornings at 6 a.m. to watch bad Hanna-Barbera cartoons like "Snorks," "Jabberjaw," "Captain Caveman," and "Space Ghost."  In between I would watch "School House Rock."  ("Conjunction junction, what's your function?")      On weeknights Daisy Duke was my future wife.  I was going to own the General Lee and shoot dynamite arrows out the back.  Why did they weld the doors shut?  At the movies the Nerds Got Revenge on the Alpha Betas by teaming up with the Omega Mus.  I watched Indiana Jones save the Ark of the Covenant, and wondered what Yoda meant when he said, "No, there is another."      Ronald Reagan was cool.  Gorbachev was the guy who built a McDonalds in Moscow.  My family took summer vacations to the Gulf of Mexico and collected "The Great Muppet Caper" glasses along the way.  (We had the whole set.) My brother and I fought in the back seat.  At the hotel we found creative uses for Connect Four pieces like throwing them in that big air conditioning unit.      I listened to John COUGAR Mellencamp sing about Little Pink Houses for Jack and Diane.  I was bewildered by Boy George and the colors of his dreams, red, gold, and green.  MTV played videos.  Nickelodeon played "You Can't Do That on Television" and "Dangermouse."  Cor!  HBO showed Mike Tyson pummel everybody except Robin Givens, the bad actress from "Head of the Class" who took all Mike's cashflow.      I drank Dr. Pepper.  "I'm a Pepper, you're a Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper, too?"  Shasta was for losers.  TAB was a laboratory accident.  Capri Sun was a social statement.  Orange juice wasn't just for breakfast anymore, and bacon had to move over for something meatier.      My mom put a thousand Little Debbie Snack Cakes in my Charlie Brown lunch box, and filled my Snoopy Thermos with grape Kool-Aid.  I would never eat the snack cakes, though.  Did anyone?  I got two thousand cheese and cracker snack packs, and I ate those.      I went to school and had recess.  I went to the same classes everyday. Some weird guy from the eighth grade always won the science fair with the working hydro-electric plant that leaked on my project about music and plants.  They just loved Beethoven.      Field day was bigger than Christmas, but it always managed to rain just enough to make everybody miserable before they fell over in the three-legged race.  Where did all those panty hose come from?  "Deck the Halls with Gasoline, fa la la la la la la la la," was just a song. Burping was cool.  Rubber band fights were cooler.  A substitute teacher was a baby sitter/marked woman.  Nobody deserved that.      I went to Cub Scouts.  I got my arrow-of-light, but never managed to win the Pinewood Derby.  I got almost every skill award but don't remember ever doing anything.      The world stopped when the  urlLink Challenger  exploded.      Did a teacher come in and tell your class?      Half of your friends' parents got divorced.      People did not just say no to drugs.      AIDS started, but you knew more people who had a grandparent die from cancer.      Somebody in your school died before they graduated.      When you put all this stuff together, you have my childhood.  If this stuff sounds familiar, then I bet you are one, too.      We are children of the eighties.  That is what I prefer "they" call it.

						   I took a different route to work today.  I think it threw my rhythm off.  I couldn't believe how cold it was today, either.  On the way home I couldn't figure out whether I wanted to eat out or in.  I ended up coming home and cooking pasta.

						   I've been neglecting writing in this book.  I need to get back on track.  I don't seem to have much free time, and when I do have free time I just don't seem to have energy.    Everyone seems to have a name for their guitars.  This is something I've been thinking about for quite some time and it's something I just can't figure out.  Many people say that there is a bond between people and their instruments, and that they name them because of this bond, but I think that's crap.    As soon as you start using the word 'artist' people get wierd.  The artists in question think they have free licnse to act like freaks.  I have no patience whatsoever with people who label themselves artists.  I have no tolerance for them at all.  And personally, I think ony artists name their guitars.  Maybe that's why mine have no name.    I enjoy writing and playing musi, writing fiction and prose, and I hope to take up paintin some day.  Noe of these things make me an artist.  I just happen to enjoy creating things.    I like to put things together.  I think that's really the root of creation.  Just putting the pieces together.  Figuring out what they make.    I've never undertaken such a large writing project as the one I am currently working on, but in retrospect I think it was the best way to begin.  I've gotten the first draft done.  20 chapters.  And still I feel the project has only just begun.    I've already been thinking ahead to my next project.  I'm going to continue to write until something happens.  I was just thinking... I might even be able to arrange a book signing at the college.  Or maybe this could be my ticket in as an instructor.  It would be wonderful to teach literature or english.    I'm ready to market myself.  To do what it takes to sell this book.  I just hope the publisher puts together a quality product.  Because I'll definately have plenty of customers.    Writing has become my new passion.  So much so that I feel I'm neglecting my music.  My present situation doesn't really afford me the luxury of being able to properly work on my music, but soon enough I hope to have my studio in order so I can start recording.    Wow.  I still can't believe I've finished the first draft of the book.  I want to see what it looks like.  I want to hold it in my hands.  I'm anxious to start working on the layout.  My sister won't be back from Italy for 4 months.  I don't think it will take me that long to finish the second draft.    I'm going to have Merrie shoot the cover.  I can start working on that.  What kind of a picture of myself should I have?  I like Stephen King's pictures lately.  Kind of offbeat and quirky.  I'll try some different things with different backdrops.    It might not be a bad idea either to set up a website.  I can market the book on the website, and then when I get my CD finished I can put that on the site too.    I keep thinkin about painting.  That would be great fun.  Wood carving as well.  Someting is bound to find a buyer.    I'm 25 years old, and I think I'm at the beginning of my next phase.  I've often heard that if you want something bad enough, and if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish it.  I was nothing more than to be a writer.

						   Back in Chicago.  I picked Merrie up at the airport last night and took her out to dinner.  I wanted to talk to her about stuff, but it just wasn't the right time.    I can't wait for it to be warmer outside.  This place would have a completely different atmosphere if the weather wasn't so cold.  The fact that it's cold outside makes it just feel so bare and unfriendly.    I took a cab from the school today after work.  The cabbie was a portly chinese fellow who rambled on to me the entire time in his broken english.  He didn't understand how it had come to be that I was married but had no children.    My sister leaves for Italy on Saturday.  An experience, to be sure.  I just hope her head is in the right place.  I'm worried about her, that she hasn't found her niche in life.  Then again, maybe no having any particular plan is her niche.  Maybe she's just a wanderer.

						   I enjoyed having dinner with my mother last night.  I don't get enough quality time with my family.  After i went to dinner with my mom, I went over to my sister's apartment.  She's getting ready to go on a 4 month trip to Italy.  I'm sure she'll have a great time.    Today is my dad's birthday.  He's 6 now.  I'll be 26 in November.  Time seems to be flying by.  I keep working on my book in hopes it will lead to something.  Even if I don' make much money on it.  As long as a publisher picks it up.  I'll feel like I've accomplished something.    As soon as I get my studio set up, I'm going to get started on my music.  I'd like to try my hand at painting as well, I think.  I like to create things.

						   We lived in an era when Roger Moore was James Bond. One of my father's all time favorite movies is "View to a Kill" and I watched it with him somewhere between 200 and 300 times.  I was intrigued by Max Zorin's evil nature, but in my mind the truly terrifying villain of the movie was played by Grace Jones.  Her hair alone was enough to keep me up at night, and her eye makeup chilled me to my very core.    The opening sequence was my favorite part.  Bond's car sustained critical damage at the beginning of the chase and it continued on through the streets of Paris ending at the Eifel Tower.  I needed that car.  Even as a a child I could appreciate the value of an indestructible car, as well as a submarine and a blimp.  They would all be mine.    Roger Moore was replaced by Timothy Dalton and my father and I uttered cries of disbelief.  We had been betrayed, and an impostor Bond was being forced upon us.  Interestingly enough, Moore had replaced Sean Connory in his 007 duties, but we still felt like Roger Moore was the only true Bond.    If I have seen "View to a Kill" hundreds of times, then I have seen "Teen Wolf" and "Back to the Future" thousands of times.  I couldn't get enough of Michael J. Fox.  I wanted to be Marty McFly more than anythin.  He was my first hero.  The movie star I looked up to.    In terms of music, my first hero was Michael Jackson.  At Lakenheath Elementary School, the lost and found rack was constantly pillaged by myself and my accomplices.  We searched for white gloves and wore our large puffy jackets with our sleeves pushed up above our elbows.  Thank God it was only a phase.    I went through lots of phases growing up.  I still find myself going through phases.  I can't pinpoint the phase I'm in now, but I'm sure that a couple of years from now I'll be referring to this period of time as some sort of phase.    There was a video store in Brandon, not far from where we lived in Weeting.  It was calling Jasanjee's (not sure if I spelt that right, but I'll choose to forgive myself).  It was in a strip along the main road, right down the street from a small town square of sorts.  This small square held a pizza place that I can distinctly remember has having the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  To this very day.  The fish and chips shop down the street, on the other hand, had the most wonderful sausages and pickled eggs.    Later there was another video store in Brandon.  I can't remember why we started going to that one instead.  There was a cartoon movie I used to rent there.  I can't remember what it was called.    That's enough about England for now.  I'll come back to it later.  Right now my thoughts are turning to Georgia.  When we moved back to the states, we flew into Dallas.  We stayed there for a little while, with my mom, and then my dad left with the Batmobile while I stayed with her and my sister for 1 more week.  I wish I had rode to Georgia with him.    The Batmobile, as it was affectionately known, was a 1965 Dodge Dart station wagon.  It had been wrecked twice, both times by my mother.  I was in the car both times.  The time I remember more sharply was the one that took place in the Target parking lot.  My mother refused to yield to a person who was cutting across the parking lot.  The accident could have easily been avoided but she shouted, "Look out lady, look out lady!" and the ran right into us.  Spun the car around and the back seat folded down on my sister an I.

						   My mind still thinks it is December.  I can't believe time is going by so quickly.  Today was a fairly good day.  Not that I got any more done today than usual., but it just seemed like a good day.  I talked to my dad, and they don't know anything about her tests yet.  He seems optimistic that everything will be fine.  I am too.    I just read an essay last night by David Sedaris about his mother having cancer.  I'm afraid for them, but Liz is a strong woman.  I feel guilty that I'm not there with them. She's been there for almost as long as I can remember.  I don't know what it would have been like if she weren't there for me and my dad.    All of this writing has gotten me thinking about the past.  Things I don't even remember I did.  We forget sometimes where we come from.  Writing has been a good experience for me to get this all down.  Someday I'll read through these pages and it will be like I'm remembering things all over again.    My sister enjoys writing as well.  She told me that she is willing to edit my book.  It will be a good experience for both of us.    Now for a change of subject.  I'm sitting here at the airport looking at the people siting around me.  Some people are so sand and depressin.  The most depressing thing I've found are the businessmen.  I sit and watch them talking on their cellphones and typing on their laptop computers.  It amazes me how important these people are, but how they're probably not happy with the lives they lead.  Take me for example.  I'm not particularly happy with my life.  I wish I wasn't travelling all the time.  I wish I wasn't a visitor in my own house.  the businessmen around me bury themselves in their work mainly because, I think, they don't want to have to come to terms with reality.  Which is to say they really don't like what they're doing to themselves.    I was just thinking back to when Merrie and I lived in Arizona.  I think that was one of the times when we were happiest.  I feel like we've been in search of that happiness ever since but we just haven't been able to find it.    Other things seem to have gotten in the way.  We're busier now.  More career oriented.  But we seem to have lost sight of the simpler things.  Like just spending time together.    I wonder sometimes if we'll make it past all of this.  Neither of us are particularly happy, and when we're together it just doesn't seem like we can enjoy our time.  There are always other things to do.    Enough about that, though.  I think they're getting ready to start boarding the plane in a couple of minutes.  I've always flown alot.  When I was younger my single most important carry-on possessions were my walkman and a Stephen King book.  I would warm up with some semi-heavy death metal during the taxiing, and when we actoually took off my walkman earbuds would be blaring pure thrash metal.  Something with a tight rhythm.  Now when you take off, they ask you to turn off all your electronic devices.  that's just no fun.    I don't even travel with a walkman any more.  I'm a businessman, I suppose.  My bag's full of business documents and my Palm Pilot.  I'm too busy now for recreation.  When I fly it is simply my opportunity to catch up on sleep.    There is a boyscout sitting behind me.  You don't see many boyscouts out in public places.  That's probably a shame.  I'll bet the organization is a good thing for keeping kids out of trouble.  I wouldn't know for sure, though.  I was only ever a cub scout, and even then it wasn't for very long.  That was back when we lived in England.    I wish I could remember more about the time I spent there.  I remember it being a wonderful place.  When you're a kid, though, most places seem wonderful.    People really read some God-awful things.  I don't mean to digress.  I actually want to go back to talking about England.  It amazes me, though, the garpage people will read simply to pass the time.  There are too many good books out there.  It doesn't make sense to waste time reading trash just because it happens to sell.  God, I hope that's not what happens with my book.    I don't think that will happen, but one can't be sure.  Many of the things I find amusing seem stupid to other people.  Merrie, for instance, could truly care less about horror movies but I am infatuated.  Ever since I can remember.  I loved watching them but I could never sleep.  When we lived in England at the ranch, the guys would watch "American Werewolf in London" and other movies along those lines.  "Silver Bullet" and "The Howling"... there seemed to be a werewolf motif to most of them.  The woods around the ranch were filled with lycanthropes, I was sure of it.    I have a hard time with water because i watched Jaws when I was little.  Not just the ocean, but swimming pools and ponds and lakes too.  When we lived in California in the early 80s, I had an overwhelming fear of bathtubs as well.  I seem to have gotten over that.    I don't remember spending much time with my sister while we were in England, or the rest of my family for that matter.  The only person I can really remember chumming around with was Fritz Conroy.  He lived at 11 Recory Lane and I lived at 31 Pepper's Close.  This is the first address I can remember memorizing.  The phone number, too.  810101.  We rented the place.  It had a small garage, and I believe the house itself was owned by Germans.    We didn't have any pets during our time there.  My sister seemed to fill that position in my young mind.  Young minds are amazingly naive, but we were a fearless lot.    We, meaning myself and Fritz, didn't really socialize with any of the british children in the area.  I'm not really even sure if there were any.  We would ride our bikes all over the place, to the far reaches of the village of Weeting.  My dad ran during this time and I can remember following him on my bike.  I remember having a particularly hard time keeping up with him.    There was a creek near the house.  Between Fritz and I.  It ran under Rectory Lane right beside his house.  We would fish there, armed with a piece of twine, a small plastic army man and a long stick.  The endeavor would keep us content for minutes at a time.  Our minds would give up, not because we realized that our efforts were futile, but because there were just more important things to do.

						   Today was a difficult day.  I had lots of time to think, and I'm troubled by my lack of planning for the future.  At this point, I don't even know if I want to continue on and get my Master's degree.  I feel like I have a lot to live up to, but it's all self-imposed.  I try to tell myself that the reason I have goals is to satisfy those around me, but at the end of the day I just feel disappointed.    I had some good ideas today.  Business ideas that might make me some money.  I don't know if they'll ever end up being worth it, but it might be worth it.  It would be good to be able to do something I enjoy for a living.  Like writing.    I'm on chapter 12 of my first novel.  The chapters are fairly short, mainly because I want to get the whole thing out of my head and onto paper.  Once I'm able to step back and look at what I have, it will be easier to figure out what I really want to do with it.    I'm sitting at the table in my apartment writing this.  Tomorrow I'm going to fly back to New Hampshire.  I'll get to see everyone over the weekend, but the person I want to see the most is the one I'm going to see the least of.  Merrie's not getting back until Sunday night and I have to fly out on Monday morning.    I was just thinking about when I was a freshman at the University of Georgia.  Those were some really interesting times.  I worked at a Subway, where me and Dave the bass player used to get stoned in the back.  We'd eat the cookie dough and eat subs all night.    Michael started working at the Subway that winter.  I was closing, because Derek was giving me a lot of hours.  Mike would work until 11:30, but then he'd hang around and talk to me while I finished cleaning up.    I'm pretty sure he was a closet homosexual, which doesn't particularly matter to me but it drove Windham crazy.  Windham worked next door at Blockbuster Music.  When I think back to it, it seems like it was another world and I was a completely different person.  I lived in  a dorm next to a Jewish fraternity house.  I helped my roommate sell his drugs.  Mostly I helped by buying them from him and skimming a little before selling the rest to Dave and his girlfriend.    Dave got pissed because he bought a quarter from me one time and ruined it.  Someone had told him that if you put a piece of orange peel in the bag and put it in the fridge, the bud would get nice and moist.  The only thing he could find was a lemon.    There used to be a store down in the downtown area called da Vinci's daughter, or something along those lines.  I bought 2 bowls and 3 bongs there over the course of my freshman year.  I think I ended up giving them all away before I moved to Arizona.  The only one I remember giving away for sure, though, was the air bong.  I gave that to Doug Eckels.  That guy was a riot.    I wonder what happened to a lot of those people, but I don't think about it too much.  Thinking about where they might have ended up gets me depressed and makes me feel guilty that I didn't keep up with them.    I moved to Arizona the summer after.  It felt like it was getting better but in all reality it just got worse.  I drank a lot more, worked a lot more, and did a lot more drugs.  I was really good friends with my next door neighbor, who drank malt liquor and bought weed by the pound.  He sold some coke for his dealer, and I moved some of it.  I'm lucky I never got into the stuff.    We'd sit over at his place or my place all night long and get stoned.  We'd listen to music and just talk about stuff.  It was fun while it lasted, but I'm lucky I got out of there.  He was in his mid-thirties and worked at a sub shop.  I could have ended up the same way.    In all, I've really been lucky so far.  I've got a good paying job, a wonderful wife and a house.  Pets, two cars, and a bunch of cool toys.  I'm not really happy, though.  When I'm here, I wish I was there, and when I'm there all I can think about is having to come back here.    Where I'm at now is not too bad.  The area is much better than where the Best Western was.  The place feels institutional, though.  Comfortable, but in the way sick people are made comfortable in order that their pain might be eased.    Whenever I watch the television, I feel like I'm wasting my time.  I feel like I should be writing, so that something might come of it.  It will be a great dissapointment if the book doesn't sell.  But if the first one doesn't sell, I'll just keep trying.  I've got lots of ideas, and something is bound to sell at some point.  It will be wonderful to give the books to my friends and family.  And maybe from that I will even sell some copies to friends of friends.    I'm not sure about a name for the book yet.  Nothing has really jumped out at me.  I've titled the project 'The Writer' and that just might stick as the name of the book.  I need to start figuring out cover art, too.  This has become a fun project and a learning experience, but in the future it would be wonderful if I had a publisher to help me out with the mundane details.

						   Every day I walk to work.  I don't do it for my health, even though I tell myself that I'm probably better off for it.  I walk because I would be broke from having to take a cab every day to and from work.  I suppose I can afford it, but frankly I'm afraid of the cab drivers.  Most of them smell, and they drive like their asses are on fire.    I've grown to enjoy walking to work.  Walking to work in the morning helps to wake me up, and walking home helps me wind down.  It's also enjoyable to walk because I seem to discover new things every day.    Every day I pass by a hospital.  The first time I walked by, I was on the way to work in the last week of December.  They were having a holiday breakfast.  Some relatives were there, but not many.  Most of the patients sat quietly and simply ate.  Some of them took their pills.  I can imagine from the looks on some of their faces that they felt neglected and cast aside.    Sometimes I get asked for money.  The people here seem more subdued than the people I had to deal with in San Francisco.  It doesn't make it any easier to tell them 'no' day after day.  I suppose I can afford to give them money, but I don't agree with the principle.  I work halfway across the continent from my wife, cat and dog.  When I go home, I'm 'visiting.'  I live here in Chicago and I work from 10 to 12 hours a day.  I earn my money.  I just can't bring myself to simply give it away.    Sometimes I think my wife is mad that I'm away from home so much of the time, but she's generally understanding.  She encourages me to do it while it is available.  I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up, though.  I'm tired most of the time even though I try to get a good night's sleep every night.  I don't eat well, and I feel sick most of the time.    I walk home every night a different way each time, it seems.  I used to only walk one way home, but I had to find a different way because I really didn't feel comfortable with it.    When I walked home last night I  passed by a park I never knew was there.  It was a nice looking park, but I didn't walk through it.  I was tired, and it was too dark.    There are 7 drycleaning shops and 5 beauty salons on the walk to work in the morning.  For some reason I don't pay as much attention to what I pass at night.  I keep my head down and walk quickly.    I've only cooked 2 meals in the apartment since I moved in.  Mostly I eat burritos.  They're really good, but probably one of the reasons I don't feel well most of the time.  I like them with green tabasco sauce.    My little sister likes them that way too.  She eats green tabasco sauce on ravioli.  I'm amazed at how much she's like me, and how different my little brother is.  She likes horror movies.  I told my mom I would bring some of my collection over to her to watch, but that's probably not a good idea.  Maybe when she gets a little older.    My little brother loves to play video games.  I can't really bring him over any of the ones I play.  They're a bit too graphic.  There's not really much for me to do here at the apartment.  I'm writing a book, but I don't do much other than that.  Sometimes I like to just sit and rest my eyes.    I feel like I'm rambling, but I'm really enjoying writing things as I think about them.  One thought seems to lead to another, and before I know it I've changed the subject 4 times in a page.  I'll enjoy looking back and reading this.    My novel is about a serial killer.  I don't know if I'll be able to sell it, but it would be nice.  I would enjoy doing something I love as an occupation.  I think I could be good at it.  This first book might not be much, but it will be something.  Something that will show that I'm serious about what I'm doing.  I can't wait to give copies of the book to my family.  To show them that I've done something.    I'm afraid I won't make a difference.  That my life won't mean anything when it's over.  I want to leave my mark on the world, but I don't know how.  I guess I just want to be remembered after I'm gone.  I want to leave something of myself behind for others to see.

						   Northside Junior High School was where I went to school for 7th and 8th grade.  There was a 9th grade class there as well, but this was around the time that HCHS was being finished.  We were going to be the first 9th grade class of the new school.    The junior high school was a new experience for me.  In elementary school there were groups of people that hung out together because they always had, but in junior high it was a bit different.  People of similar social backgrounds began to be friends, and groups intermingled.  Also, there were definite classifications to the groups.  There were metalheads, rednecks, athletes, FHA types, and the list goes on.  This was around the time that I began taking honors classes.  I don't specifically recall what prompted it, but I believe it was based on some standardized test.  I scored a high enough percentage or I had good enough grades, so I was invited into the honors program.  The honors program at that time only encompassed two classes.  There was honors science and honors english / literature.    All other classes I took with non-honors students, including math.  Homeroom started each day.  There was still a recess, but this was not a dodgeball / play on the playground type of recess.  At this recess, everyone pretty much just stood around and talked.  There were baseketball hoops, and once in a while there was a pickup basketball game. Usually it was just the black boys, and they didn't want to have anything to do with the white boys.  Racial tension was still pretty high, and the races did not really intermingle freely.    There was one black guy who I remember playing basketball.  I think his name was Greg.  He was huge compared to the rest of us, and we all thought it was amazing that he could slam dunk the ball.  This was the time during which Michael Jordan was king.  Everyone was wearing the 'new' Air Jordans that Nike had put out.  Greg would get a running start and would jump from the foul line to make his dunks.  We would all stand around and clap, thinking it was the most amazing thing.  In reality, I don't think the goal was regulation size but that didn't diminish the accomplishment.    We had gym.  There were special clothes that you were supposed to wear for gym.  I didn't wash mine that often and as a result they smelled quite fragrant after a while.  I had a locker.  The first year it was orange I think, and the second year it was yellow.  I used my locker at first, but after a while I just learned to carry my books around between classes.  It was just easier than having to fight the crowd to get to my locker.  There were top lockers and bottom lockers and inevitably the co-occupant of my vertical space was at his or her locker, taking time to socialize and not getting out of my way.    McCarter used my locker in 8th grade because it was closer to his class.  I think it is actually because he didn't want to get caught with booze in his locker so he hid it in mine instead.  He used to put whiskey in Listerine bottles and keep it in my locker.  He'd drink between classes.  He was in 9th grade.  He drove to school.  Think about this... he DROVE to junior high school.  When it came time to go to high school he went to Northside High and I went to Houston County High.  Even though he just lived down the street.  For some reason it worked out that way.

						   When I started high school I didn't really know anybody.  They had just build HCHS near my house and I was part of the first freshman class.  The original plan was that I would go to Northside High School.  What they did, though, was reorganize so that everyone who was already midway through high school at Northside (where I would have gone) stayed there to finish off.  So I went to HCSH. I met Brent, and through Brent I met Mike and Brad.  And through Brad I met Hans.  Brent lived over in Statham's Landing, which at the time was one of the nicest neighborhoods in Warner Robins.  Living over there meant that you had money.  Brent's dad was a colonel.  Hans, surprisingly enough, lived there as well.  Hans was huge, probably about 6'5" and had long blond straight hair.  He looked like one of the band members of Obituary.  He had a Gibson Les Paul and a Peavey Classic.  I remember seeing him and Brad play at the talent show.    I was amazed at how someone who looked like such a loser metalhead could live in such a nice neighborhood.  Appearances can be deceiving, and as children I think we take background for granted.  We don't really think about where people came from, or where they're going.  We just think in the moment, and look at life as a series of snapshots.  I saw Hans as a snapshot.  He was a loser metalhead with a nice guitar.  I didn't think about who he really was.

						   Yesterday was one of those days.  We left the house for the aquiarium and the weather started getting worse and worse.  We finally got down to Boston and it was pouring.  We walked about 6 blocks to the aquiarium and the line of people waiting to buy tickets was ridiculously long.  Alex was crying because he didn't want to sit in his chair.  I can't blame him.  He was really being a champ, considering the circumstances.  They wouldn't sell anymore tickets, and at about the time we were trying to figure out what to do next they started evacuating the place because someone had pulled a fire alarm.  We regrouped under an awning once we were able to fight our way out of the crowd.  On the way back to the car, a deranged person ran up the street screaming profanities and took his shirt off and started slapping it against a light post.  Merrie cried once we were in the car.    Before yesterday, I hadn't really put any thought into the responsiblity I have as a protector of my family.  I started to think, though, about what would have happened if the guy had tried to harm either Merrie or Alex.  Or if anyone else tried to harm them.  I worry that I might not be able to protect them.  I would do the best I could, but I worry that it might be enough.  I don't know how to come to terms with that.  I know my responsibilities as a parent and a spouse, but I just worry that something will happen and I'll find myself unable to do anything.  I would die to protect my family, but what if that wasn't enough?  What if they still came into harm's way?

I washed my car last week but didn't get a chance to really detail it. I got some of those carwash wipes to do the door sills with. And some of that Meguiar's spray detail stuff.  Maybe I'll try to do that this weekend.  P - Same here man. I have a large list myself hopefully I will get to some of it this weekend. I need to clean the garage back out so sheetrock can be done in there when it is time.  Luckily Michelle is going to a candle party tonight at 7. that will give me time to wash my jeep and hers. Her parents are taking our camper and the jeep for a week of camping this coming week. Michelle will be driving the sunfire again, lol. Mike has actually done a lot of work to it. Thermostat, muffler, water pump. I got new plugs for it. Traded in plugs I had for explorer for the ones she needed.  N - Yep. That's always the way it is.  P - Yes it does. I wouldn't worry she will have shopping come up so you either have to go or watch Alex so either way it won't get done.  N - She said she was going to email it to me. That means trouble... a long list.  P - Lol I hear ya on that. Has merrie given you the list that she will keep you too busy to do?  N - >Hell yeah, I am. I've been ready since Monday morning.  P - Its all good. Ready for the weekend?  N - Okay. Wasn't sure. Figured I would ask.  P - No they don't along with ed anymore. Mainly due to his wife (dads sister) but dad doesn't interact with them unless he absolutely has no choise. So just us is all I would say.  N - Okay, tell Ed that we'll plan for next weekend then. Anyone else I should invite over? Your parents, maybe?  P - He hasn't heard back yet from him. Ed said next weekend is good for him.  N - Sounds good. Hey, did you ever hear back from Joel on the guy that might want to buy my Alpine stuff?  P - Cool. I will send him a note and find out.  N - If next weekend works for him, that would be cool.  P - Cool. Ed will be up this weekend till the 23rd. He wants to know when you want to get together.  N - Okay. Just let me know when you want to do it. I'm up for it.  P - Nope. Next weekend. We should go to the field and hit the ball around.  N - Do you have a game this weekend?  P - Yeah I had 2 plays last night that I should have had the person beat at 1rst by my throw wasn't strong enough. Need to work on it.  N - Sounds good to me.  P - Cool. I defiantly want to. We need to play catch again, lol.  N - Sounds good. Just let me know... we should be around pretty much all day.  P - I think so. I just got to find out what is up with my cousins flight.  N - Nifty. You guys coming over on Saturday?  P - That is cool. I have to go to the airport Saturday to pick up my cousin. Besides that I think we aren't up to, too much  N - I think I' m going to focus on getting Merrie's office finished off so that I can get her sewing table out of my room. Then I've got some outside stuff to do. Other than that, I want to just clean up a little bit. The house isn't too bad, but there's just so much crap that always seems to be lying around.

						   Enough about that.  Time for a topic change.  I've liked horro movies for as long as I can remember.  The first horror movie I can vividly remember is Friday the 13th Part IV.  The Final Chapter.  Rob and I were sleeping over at Adrian's house, and it came on that night.  Actually, that's not true.  I remember when we still lived in England.  I saw American Werewolf in London.  That absolutely scared the hell out of me, and it changed my life forever.  After that I was hooked on horror.  I have found that there are very distinct types of horror fans.  There are people who only like zombie movies, while others prefer monster movies.  Delineation goes on and on.  Some monster movie fans are only interested in movies involving man-made monsters, while others prefer alens or newfound species.  There are monster fans who devote their time exclusively to the likes of Godzilla.  My point is, the genre of horror is so broad that there are innumberable movies to choose from with a variety of themes and character types.  And that's what makes it all so great.  If asked to sub-categorize my preference in horror movies, I would have to say that I am a diehard fan of gruesome humor.  Gore in a humerous context is the best.  Look at films like Evil Dead II and Dead Alive.  Intelligently written, directed and produced, with scenes of gore that rival anything else ever made within the genre.  I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies, but I can certainly appreciate what they've done.  I mean, where would we be today without Night of the Living Dead?  And talk about themes... watch the end of the movie and you'll know what I mean.  Some would even say the killing of the black man at the end of the movie was symbolic of white oppression during that time (keep in mind the time at which the film was made).  Great directors come from horror, there is no doubt of that.  Some, like George Romero, will forever be bound to the genre.  Others have moved out of horror and into the mainstream with great success.  Sam Raimi, John Carpenter, Peter Jackson, all of these people have had extreme success in film.  And here's a shocker that you might not know about.  James Cameron.  That's right, the one and only Titanic director who also rought us the Terminator got his start in the Pirhana series.  Kind of funny, isn't it?

						   I was thinking about Morning Dove Lane again yesterday, and I remember when we painted the house.  It was no easy undertaking, that's for sure.  Before we painted it, the house was an odd yellowish color with purple/red trim.  Almost burgundy, but just a bit too purple.  We ended up painting it an off-white color with brown trim.  The garage door got painted brown too.  By the time we were done, the brown really did look better.  I can't remember how long he had lived there before we started painting or how long we lived there after it was done, but as it was our first house we were proud of the job that had been done.

						   When we lived at 222 Morning Dove Lane, my father and I built a fence in the back yard.  For the longest time, we had a dirt back yard and the grass simply refused to grow there.  April would be chained to a stake in the back yard, and she would run around in circles, as far as the chain would reach.  So in order to alleviate any further damage to the back yard, we put up the fence.  It was about 6 feet high, and the slats were wood.  My dad bought the pressure treated wood and kept it in the garage for a period of time in order to allow it time to contract.  I know that's not a very interesting story but it is one of the times that stands out in my mind when my dad and I built something together.  Michael Jordan Quote - I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.  I've lost almost 300 games.  Twenty six times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed.  I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.

						   When I was in fifth grade, we lived at Scarborough Road.  It was the first time we had been back to the States in three years.  One day I came home from school to find that my parents had bought a dog.  A dalmatian puppy named April.  I had been playing with a bow and arow in the back yard.  I don't remember the specifics, but a glass bottle was found, and I put it on the deck railing, shot at it and broke it.  When they brough April home and let her out back, she cut her paw on the glass.  She loved chasing the squirrels in the back yard.   We had a number of large pine trees, and the squirrels would antagonize the dog by perching out of reach in the trees and chattering.  Dad like to rough house with the dog, and one occasion she bit him.  It was either on or near one of his testicles, i I remember correctly.  He and the dog didn't get along well after that.  On some nights, the dog would sleep on my bed.  I would wake up in the morning to find her sprawled out on the bed.  When we got her, she seemed large.  I'm not sure how old she was when we got her, but she must have been at least 6 months old.  She would crap in the back yard and I would have to go out and clean it up.  And with thick layers of pine straw in the back from not raking each season, it was no easy task.

						   Such a long time with no entries.  I'll have to get better about that.  Mike, Brad and I used to get together and jam.  What this usually meant was playing for 20 to 30 minutes at a time the same 2 or 3 chords rhythm while Brad soloed over it.  We would come up with interesting little melodies, and some of them actually sounded pretty good.  Once in a while we would remember to tape record them.  I don't actually have any of those tapes, and I'm not sure if any of them do either, but it would be very interesting to hear what we sounded like.  Brad had a Crate stack and a Peavey practice amp, along with a nice Ibanez multi-effects unit and an Ibanez distortion pedal, which I now have for some reason.  Mike had a drum set that he had gotten for Christmas.  He added cymbals later on.  I had a Danelectro and no guitar amp.  I usually borrowed one from Brad.  It was fun to play because more than anything, it was fun to fuel our thoughts with what it might possibly be like to someday be playing in front of people, and be recognized.

						   I have three specific memories of the talent shows that were held at HCSH.  The first was of Brad and Hans playing together in a makeshift band of sorts.  Hans was a very tall and longhaired guy who definately fit the part he was trying to play.  Brad, on the other hand, always seemed like a cleancut guy trying to be a metalhead.  The same way I was.  I don't remember that they played but I just remember being awestruck by the fact that I knew people in a band who were playing in front of people.  I wanted it to be me up there.  As it happens, the next year I was the person up there.  Kevin, Skitzo and I auditioned one day after school.  It was a moment that I will never forget.  The auditorium was half-filled with the other students trying out, and their friends, as well as some curious instructors.  I plugged in my guitar, turned on my amp (a bass amp borrowed from Kevin) and started soundchecking while everyone else was still setting up.  It sounded godly in my mind.  My third memory is of how disappointed I was that I wasn't going to be able to play in the actual talent show.  I can't even remember the reason why.  We had auditioned with a song that Kevin and Chris had written and we were going to play "Sober" by Tool at the show.  They ended up playing the original.  As funny as it sounds, there really was no talent exhibited during the talent shows.  Basically it was a case of 'look what I know how to do'.  It just felt special playing in front of people.  It always has, and I'm sure it always will.

						   One of my electives in high school was a video class.  Mike Dickerson was in the class, and so was Brent.  Brent was only in the class for a semester, but Mike and I toook the class for 2 years.  The class was taught by a gentleman named John Altos Godfrey.  The big culminating project for both years was a video yearbook.  We shot footage through the entire year and then mixed it all together and put it to the music that was popular at the time.  The finished product was aptly referred to as "Flashbacks."  We really didn't seem to learn anything from the instructor.  What Mike and I learned came as the result of experimentation at the expense of hours of time spent manipulating ourselves on film.  We recorded things and played them backwards at regular speed.  We started simple, and figured out backwards action equivalents to random actions.  Walking backwards to an open door, though it, and closing it gave the appearance of entering the rom when played backwards.  A source of endless comedic amusement was watching footage of Mike eating a Snicker's bar.  Lunch at the school was 90 cents, plus 10 cents for milk making it an even dollar (if I remember correctly).  We would use our lunch money instead on soda and a candy bar, both 50 cents.  During our lunch breaks daily, we would record our backwards footage, refining our techniques until we were able to record elaborate scenes with multiple people.  We even learned how to play baseball backwards.  We tried numerous times to bring other people into the action.  They never really understood the subtle complexities of the work we were doing.  After all, it wasn't just for amusement.  It was art.

						   One of the things we would often do in Georgia was play war.  Capguns were what we usued, often without caps.  This game followed me from Scarborough Road, where the event was often highly orchestrated and tended to involve the entire neighborhood, to Morning Dove Lane, where it was usually played with just Leland and myself.  At Scarborough Road we played in the woods behind the houses.  The woods seemed to go on for miles, as the probably did.  In recent visits to Georgia I have been stunned and amazed at how built up the area is.  Back then, though, many of the neighborhoods ended in wooded areas that provided immediate wilderness and seclusion for those of us who chose to seek it.  It was a great place for war, and we made the game as simple as possible for ourselves.  Two teams, each guarding a base.  Each team could take prisoners or kill other people on opposing teams.  It was the object of each team to capture the other teams' base, but I don't recall that ever being the case.  Each game was simply a largescale game of hide and seek, where each person playing the game was both hiding and seeking.  Games of war at Morning Dove Lane were much more imaginative.  Leland's father was a chief master sargent in the U.S. Airforce.  He was my best friend while I was in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.  I digress... Leland's father had a collection of military coveralls and boots that we would often use when playing war.  There was a small span of woods that we played war in behind his house (between his house and Ryan Avery's house).  We would pretend that we were fighting off the enemy from our home base (his house).  Another great place to play war was in the unfinished area that continued past Dove Cove, an area called Barrington Estates.   Three houses past Leland's, the road became dirt.  This road continued on for about a quarter mile in total.  At the end of Morning Dove Lane the road forked.  One direction was towards Water Drive, the dump and the fire station (to the right) and the other was to the large dirt mound at the end of the road (left).  We were convinced that this area was once populated by the triads, enormous arthropod-like 3 legged machines.  It was our mission to protect from their attempts to invade the area.  Our supplies for war were usually limited to what we were able to find either in Leland's garage or my own.  Once, though, I remember buying mosquito net camouflage gloves and a length of rope, also camouflage, to aid in our sorties.

						   We used to hang out in the halls before homeroom.  I had never had a homeroom before, so I wasn't sure what this meant.  Apparently it meant nothing more than getting checked in before going to class.  We would say the pledge, there would be a role call, and then the homeroom teacher would hand out any paperwork that we needed to take home and get signed, or anything else like that.  In one of my homerooms, it was 7th grade, I think, there was a stack of magazines.  The Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition was, strangely enough, one of the magazines that was in there.  I remember in one shot you could almost see one of the model's nipples.  Not quite, but almost.  Not a good magazine to have in a classroom half full of boys right on the onset of puberty.  During gym we would change and all of the cool guys had spray deodorant.  That was a big thing, for some reason.  I got some, and it was cool because other guys would ask if they could borrow it.  I took a shop class and we built bookshelves and gun racks.  Those were the two options.  You could build a gun rack or a bookshelf.  The teacher's name was Mr. Lundford.  He was a big scary guy, the kind that gets a thrill out of the time he saw a student cut his hand off because he was fucking around with the saw and not paying attention.   The wood putty was dry, and the varnish was nasty cheap stuff.  Still, it was neat to build something and then take it home and show it off.  Sort of a "look what I learned how to do" thing.  Mr. Bailey was next door to Mr. Lundford.  He taught typing.  I used to be pretty quick to type, and there was a black kid in my class who I used to type papers for in addition to my own.  I'm not sure how that arrangement came to be, but it was fine with me because he was one of the cool guys and he sort of kept an eye on me.  He didn't let anyone mess with me.  Martin and Charles were two guys that were in my honors classes.  They were mean to me for some reason.  I'm not really sure why.  Charles had Reebok Pump tennis shoes (the ones with the tennis ball) and Martin had really nice green and purple air Jordans.  I never really had nice shoes until high school.  When I went to high school my dad let me buy some black Nike Air Flights.   There was a girl named Michelle in my home economics class.  She was the first girl I remember 'going out' with in Junior High.  We didn't do anything except hold hands and hug once, but I found out later that she went out with a guy at the high school.  Dominick became her boyfriend.  She told him that she gave the high school guy a blowjob.  She said, "it tasted bleachey."  Funny, the things we remember.  I dated a girl from my honors classes, I don't remember her name.  There were Heather and Stephanie.  I had a huge crush on Sheri (I don't remember her last name) but she looked just like Diane Franklin in Better off Dead.  Yummy.  I dated Stella.  That was something I got major crap for.  She lived kind of near me when we were at Dove Cove.  That was the first time I actually went out on a date with someone.  It was wierd.  We went and saw a Bette Midler movie.  I think we held hands.  I did volunteer work in the library.  I got caught listening to my walkman in the library and it got taken away from me.  Somehow, though, I got to be friends with the librarian and I always hung out there between classes.  I was friends with the librarian in 5th and 6th grade as well.  I always was, for some reason.  I liked to read.   I used to dress up sometimes to go to school.  I would wear a tie and dress shoes and stuff.  I don't know why.  I just did it once in a while.  I had these shoes that had were like wingtips but had little metal accents at the toe.  I only had one or two ties.  Sometimes I wore suspenders, but the cool thing was to wear them down.  We rolled up our pants in this wierd tight way.  Everyone did.  I couldn't get my dad to buy me the socks that were supposed to go with pants that way.  See, the cool thing was to wear high top sneakers with ankle high socks.  Then roll the pants up.   They always ended up buying me calf high socks.  So what I did was take the socks and pull them up only to my anlkes, then fold them underneath my foot.  Don't ask me why this was cool as to this day I have no clue.  Pushed up sleeves were cool too.  So were the radar hairdos for girls and the mulletts for guys.  I had a mullett.  It was spiked on top, and then long in the back.  But not too long.  Rat tails were cool, but they were starting to fade.

						   We went to Paris while we were living in England. I don't remember many specifics about the trip, but I do remember seeing the catacombs.  There were bones upon bones stacked in a large underground area.  I was amazed that it didn't smell bad and it didn't seem particularly claustrophobic.  We saw the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triumph, and Notre Dame cathedral.  We had an extremely hard time getting into the cathedral.  The police had large areas of the grounds shut down because someone had managed to jump off the cathedral and commit suicide.  I remember seeing the police cover the body with a large blue tarp.  I don't remember seeing any blood but my dad saw the bodyand said it looked like the person had tried to land on their feet, and their legs were pushed up into their body.  I remember eating a portion of a baguette in the hotel room.  The only other thing I remember was almost being hit by a car while trying to cross the street.  That's not true.  Actually, I remember the Louvre as well.  Even though I was a little boy at the time, I still couldn't believe how small the Mona Lisa was.  It was enclosed in a glass case, and people were swarmed around it.  I don't remember being particularly impressed by it, but that was mainly because I had the sort of attention span characteristic of little boys who would rather be in other places and doing other things.
