      Wow, I just got a phone call from Tiz, my agent and he wants me to do a film with stars such as Billy Crystal, Reese Witherspoon,Keanu Reeves,Jude Law, Drew Barrymore and Arnold Schwarzenegger, haha nice mix huh?  Anyway the film is about a girl(me of course) who gets lost and cant find her way back home because she was on the way to Russia with her family to see her dad who was in the mafia but he quit and ever since he quit people wanted to track him down and so the family decide that the only chance to visit him would be now, so to go undetected they have to find someone with fake passports who can make them some, then hitch rides(on the way encountering several funny personalities) and then when they get there they find that their father (Arnold Schwarzenegger) had turnes into a Yoga teacher for the stars. Well, while they are there people started to get suspicious and the family had to split up, The girl (me) starts on the journey to their meeting point in China in Bejiing, she then meets a guy and falls in love with him but  he turns out to be one of the people trying to track her down but doesnt know she is the one he has to track down. And then it goes to the journey oft the other family members and they get caught before she does and they get locked in a flat. Then the girl finds the town of Bejiing with the help of her guy (bad)  and he realises that shes the one hes trying to catch but since they are in love he helps her to get his family out of the mafia buisness. Hahaha Anyway seems great. I gotta go have my hair and nails done and a nice massage before i record my next hit single.This will be my last song as i am retiring and going into Movies full-time. So i gotta go but bye for now  Ella

Well today I won the beauty pageant in Germany, no suprises there. and we have just been on a beautiful Island in Thailand, there were boys,sun,cocktails,the beautiful sea and of course my wonderful family, i just bought a whole new wardrobe and when i came home there were jelly beans everywhere, it must have been my oh so perfect boyfriend who will always love me and doesnt change his mind about me.  Does anyone have any suggestions for more of a perfect lifestyle??? Its really hard once you mentioned what u like.

      My name is Ella Sprinkles and I am 18 years old, i have the perfect life. Yes a perfect life and here i am top of the class, pretty, great at the arts and i am already a famous actress/singer and i dont have to work for it, i do it when i want to. Ahhhh dreamy i know, and yes i have a perfect boyfriend, with his dreamy eyes, soft lips and gorgeous skin. His personality has to be 10/10. He is everything I ever wanted: Confident but not cocky,polite,cute, clever but not freakishly, hot as it can get, only loves me and doesnt change his feelings towards me because he loves me all the time and noone else. He's mine. What else is perfect about my life, ahh yes my family, no fights ever parents get along and dont fight, my brothers and sisters are sweethearts, they are so polite and are always kind and considerate. I love it here. Whatever i want i get in a special machine which i type in what i want and costs me nothing (free gift from my friend who is a famous inventor). I better go, im going shopping :D  Bye Bye
