      I was digging around looking for something else and ran accorss this, very dark, very accuret, very hard to read thing I wrote a long long time ago. Wanted to post it so I'm pressed to continue.   Haight Street By me... duh.  The house was dark. The rain clung to my windowpanes like teardrops on broken lovers cheeks. All I could hear was the sound of flesh flapping on the linoleum, the cracks of the belt, and the pounding night. There were the muffled confused sobs after each snap that broke the otherwise paralyzed air. 	I could only tell my door snuck open because of the sudden soft waft of cold air I felt crawl across my face and sudden increase of tension in the room. I could feel her feet climbing the wooden ladder just behind my head, and I could hear the bolts and beams moan under her stress and she climbed into her bed above me. I could hear her bring her breath under control, until finally the room was still. 	I lay stiff for a while, as all frightened children do. Covers pulled tight to the chin, eye’s wide and searching, trying desperately to summon the courage to close them again. Trying desperately to understand what was going on, trying desperately to understand why it was happening. I focused on the bleeding sky outside again, and the crawling fingers of water gripping at the window.  	When the moments of silence in the room added up into a dense knot in my stomach, I rolled onto my side and closed my eyes and tried not to think anymore.  “It’s not your fault,” She whispered. 	I tried not to cry, and went to sleep.  In the morning my sister and I acted as if the nights downpour had washed away our memories like we knew we had to. She had learned long before how to dress in a way that the clothing wouldn’t bind over the welts, and how to avoid situations where she may get touched where her wounds were. I had learned that we didn’t talk about it before I learned to talk.

      I think I've secured my spot in the Scorpio club with all the dark somberness anyone can handle, so it's time for something compleatly different. [cackle - geeky referance allert]  I have this little experiment that I want to conduct, and I'd love it if others out there did it too, to get a good survey.  Ok, Pick 5 or 6 large charches in or around your city. Go to confession and confess the same sin, write down what the pennance is for each church. This way all people will know where to go to get the best bang for you buck, so to speak.  would be really interesting to see the contrasts within a single church as well.  yes, It could be said that this is extreemly disrespectful of other religions, and I have to dissagree. because I in no way am insulting or demening any institution that builds so  many bad-ass buildings that would make excellent bars. as long as your respectfull, no harm no foul  And If there is a hell that I'm going to rot in, at least they'll have taquilla and AC, thank you very much.

      Floater - Out of Sight  Looking back accross the years, At a million unshed tears, How could I have held them all? And Oh, the price I paid, for all the love I never made, Someone wrote up on the walll.  "Oh, how mighty is my pen, If this is everywhere it's been?" Yes the wines delicious but I'm needing something stronger, I growing suspicious that I woun't be here much longer And it feels like I'm going down again. It feel like I've lost my ownly friend.  Crawling home from some saloon, And all my strings are out of tune, no one's around to break my fall. No attempt was ever made, So I slowly decade have a little faith in me that's all.  How mightly am I then,  If this is everywhere I've been And as the daylight broke I cast no shadow on the wall, I will disinigrate untill there's nothing left at all Feels like I'm going down again, Feels like I've lost my only friend.  And I never thought I see the day My heros all became phycotics My drugs are all exspensive exotics My blood is thick with antibiotics So I toss the coin to fate, it's only right Take no blame so I can sleep so tight, You know that out of mind is also out of sight.  And as the laylight broke I cast no shadow on the wall I pass the closed apartment door in rows along the hall Feels like I'm going down again, feels like I've lost my only friend.

      I'm tired to looking for you in the rearview mirror.  looking for a shillowette that reminds me of that night. I'm tired of wondering if you wonder like me, about me, about you.  I'm ready to let go, and yet there is nothing to replace you. The part you me that you took is still gone, and I'm not sure I want it back. After what I leared about myself from you.   Sometimes loosing yourself in someone is the best way of learing what is left behind. What is left behind? Is it a wiser, more complete self? or just a slightly more fragmented puzzel that's missing a piece it didn't need?  Perhaps that's the Blank Rune. The unknowable, the undecided, the everchaning dark logic that only follows the rules it makes up as it goes along the way, dragging us kicking and screaming, into the light.

      Everyone has done this. Someone has just said something to you, and you heard and understood it, yet you have to stop, re-process what was just said to you, just to form a lucid response. To frequently we have our shilds up - so strong that that we can't even pay attention to what is going on outside of it.   I asked at least sixty people a very simple question last night, so obvious as to be cliche', just in a different  way. Instead of asking people, 'Paper or Plastic?', I asked if people had a bag prefferance. 46 of them required a restatment of the question to understand it. 28 needed the question explained.  A good number of them apologized, and stated variouse things explaning thier lack of attention.   This little experiment verified a nasty habit that a good portion of the population is acustomed to. We seem to all be on auto-piolet. we prepare to answer the questiones that we exspect will come, not the ones that are asked. This lack of living beyond ones-self was what I exspected, but to a degree I didn't see comming.   Oddly enogh, it was another customer that brought the next idea to mind. A young girl, who reportedly never stopped talking before, had shaved her head and apparently taken a vow of silence. The concept of bending your whole will to listening and contemplatling that wich surrounds you is very enticing. Then eventually only speaking when you've got something that isn't automatic and empty to say. It sounds obvious and yet, impossible at the same time.

      Today I sit wondering at the probable. The probable is never going to happen unless it becomes inevitable, wich is often what is least likely to happen.   If you've ever taken a vation you'll know exsactly what that means. You joke about how the airline will probably loose your luggege, but rationalize this fear away using the logic that out of all the people traveling, your highly unlikely to be chosen as the butt of the univeres jokes today. Somehow the Gods hear this. When I say the Gods you may input any intangible intelliegent and persuasive entity you like, be it the Goddess, Jesus, or the Cosmic Muffin. Again, the cosmic muffin is very unlikly to be what us silly humans having been killing and dying for, but you know how wrong you were about your luggage too. As I was saying the Gods hear your prayers, and as logical as it would be to belive, hope and wish that these Gods ansewer those prayers with good outcomes, it's simply more probably that this is one of those life oppratuniies your Highschool Counslor told you about. This is about growth, and if there is any nonfalacious reason for killing and dying over a god it's because he/she/it made you grow against your will and you were not amused to an extreem degree.  I've been told over and over again that if growth were easy everyone would do it. That is not a lie, it's just a clever way to end the sentance prematurely. If growth were easy, everyone would do it, but it sucks the life and hope out of you and when you wake up in a dark bleary hole looking up at the refracting light of the life you've spotted glinting above you, you keep swimming twords it, even though you know you've got no air, no chance to reaching it - It's too beautiful to give up. It's Joy quatified and mesured. Because that life on the other side of the surface is always clean, clear and complete. There is an inherint problem with that logic, and it's not that there is always another side of that surface - like a horizon you'll never reach. The problem is that it's the truth. And the truth sucks.
