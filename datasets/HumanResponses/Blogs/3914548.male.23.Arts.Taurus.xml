      I saw an ex on the street last night. After I got over my initial disgust at his sustained health I began to consider that the streets of London must be littered with such dating-debri. One man's passer-by is another man's 'why-didn't-he-call?'.

      After my lunch at the Lucky Spot cafe (on North Audley, just off Oxford Street - has the nicest waitress in the world), Dorothy and I wandered to my favourite place - Selfridges' Foodhall. After staring at a chocolate eclair for about ten minutes Dorothy made me buy it, saying life is too short to let good cakes pass us buy. I bought said eclair and they wrapped it in a lovely white box. Am I the only one who thinks that cakes in boxes are the most wonderful things ever? The elegance of the box makes the difference...  The office was obviously jealous. I am now obviously fat.

      I have just found out how much the pooch that appears as Wellard in EastEnders earns per year. And, just to make me feel great about my own career, he earns more than me! A dog, albeit a nano-celeb of a canine, earns more than me! This only goes to prove that dogs are the biggest menace to our society. Don't even get me started on the state of tv licensing. THIS is where our moneys goes?! Ridiculous!  PS: For the record, he earn Â£26,000 per annum apparently.

      Urgh. Work party last night has left me feeling dry and tired. Promised myself only a couple of Mojito's, but ended up dancing wildly to the Pointer Sister's at midnight. And it takes more than a few to get me on that dance floor. Seeing as I work in publishing there was one upside to the night - no eligable men to disgrace myself in front of. There were so many women at the party I felt quite special having testicles. And of the gay men in my company I don't think any of them are suitable. Past experience of the ol' office romance has well and truly put me off that anyway. Yuk. (Was major worry that Gitface might be there last night, but thankfully he wasn't)  I didn't appreciate the empty state of the tube train this morning, not properly. I know I should've been relishing the fact I could sit down and breathe and not panic about how the hell I would get past thirty five bodies when the tube arrived at my stop (Hyde Park Corner), but I was just tired.   Off to Newcastle tonight for four days. Bit grim, it's a funeral.   I need coffee...

      So I'm supposed to support public transport, I know. I know it is a great idea that we all get to travel across the city at speed, minimising the pollution levels that cars creat. I love the fact I can take a tube to work every day. But can I just say that people make it REALLY hard for me to enjoy said tube journey to work every day if they persist in acting like cunts in such a confined space. Why aren't people just a little bit more normal? Why, oh why, oh why?  Sorry. Rant over.   In other news:   Having haircut on Wigmore St. My hairdresser is so cool it hurts. He's also very funny to talk to about relationships because his viewpoint is so refreshingly different to anything I generally get from my friends. He's bit player, bit sensitive, bit total sex maniac. I like that mix. Am always a bit dubious of a hairdresser that insists on wearing a hat but what can I do about that eh?   Worklife continues as per usual. Have distinct lack of emails today. This does not impress me and leaves me feeling thoroughly unpopular! Maybe my Outlook is broken? Not worth ringing IT and asking though as I can't face the embarrassment of them saying "er no, you're just a loser with no friends". Which I am not.   On the way to work I listened to: Rufus Wainwright  For breakfast I ate: Toast Things I argued about with my sister today: The position of the living room lamp. Changing a fuse.   Love Ax

      Update: My haircut was a joy.   Topics we dicussed: travel writing, little britain, european hostels.   Now all I have to do is survive the work party tonight and I'll be reet.  Ax
