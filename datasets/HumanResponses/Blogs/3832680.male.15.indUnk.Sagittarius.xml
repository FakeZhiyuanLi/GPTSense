          I just heard Barack Obama, a state senator from Illinois, talk in the dem national convention. He is everything Kerry isn't and his retoric makes Clinton look like, well, me.      I would love to see an incredible surge in the poles for him, and I would just hug someone if he replaced Kerry on the ticket tomorrow...      ok, it wouldn't happen, but a boy can dream, cant he?

      This post will be short because the Miracle Of Modern Medicine pumped my veins with more codene than blood, and thus i have the attention span of a small monkey.     I got my wisdom teeth out.    my face swelled up like a small monkey's    I spent several days playing computer games 14 hrs straight, until my eyes were yellow and jittery... like a monkey's.    I think you can see what im getting at here an that is that IM A FUCKING MONKEY!!!    sorry.     -M

      My birthday is the pit of hell, that tempsetial, soggy time of the year known as late November. The 28th is especially wretched, because it most often involves eating turkey and attempting to talk to my cousins in the "holiday" of thanksgiving. A few years ago, I decided I wanted a new date on which to eat waffles (my fave) recieve presents and be worshiped. I settled on July 4th, as I could get fireworks on my birthday. I will cotinue this later, because now I need to go eat waffles, recieve gifts, and be worshipped.

      Im a maccie. Sad but true. Compounded with the fact that I have an iMac from the stone age, the only available games this year are, are, ummm.... Well, this is where i need help. If anyone knows of any games compatible with a 600 mhz G3 512mb ram 300gb hd and a 16mb video card, I would thank you profusely. As of now I am stuck with a crappy game called Avernum, which has graphics at the level of Tetris and the playability of tic-tac-toe. Pleeeze! Im desperate!  -Morley  btw, Tic-tac-toe is one of the most moronic games of all time.

      Todays entry can be summed up in a list of advice you never asked for.  Life Lessons:  1. It turns out that the "xxx hot burrito inferno" really is painfull, they don't just say that.  2. Spicy foods are as scalding coming out as going in.  3. It turns out that a bar mitzfah is different than a briss.  4. When sitting through your parent's friend's son's bar mitfah, it is a good idea to bring a book along.  5. The books they give you are written in hebrew.  6. It helps to have a bedroom next to a bathroom, especially in the event of a Moctezuma-style Flaming Meal Of death.  7. If a blog entry takes 2 trips to the bathroom to complete, it really isn't worth it.  class dismissed.  -Morley
