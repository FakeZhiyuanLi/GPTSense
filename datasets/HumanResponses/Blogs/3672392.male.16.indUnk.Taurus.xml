       just got off work, had the urge to write something...here it is...    love can still make you smile while causing you agony and pain. it's all kind of bittersweet like the the sun-shine in the rain. i swung open this door to my heart, letting your esscence surround me, enclosing my mind in a room full of thoughts closuer on these feelings being the only way out.. on one moments last breath  i found my still-beating love for you astounding but when the breath was gone my lungs caved-in shrivled with the realization that i was too late and this realization was ever so grounding no longer on a cloud of thoughts,  floating upon a cloud of dreams no love, no passion, or intimacy left within us to concieve no more chance to make up for the years that i let slip through our finger tips what we had is and will always be a memory that i will not soon forget. please dont be be the one that will, please don't let it go.    kinda crappy, but oh well... bye

       yeah...right now its almost two in the morning, and i just couldn't sleep.  Too much thinking going on in my head.... this is what came out of it.    i walked past you with a smile and you said hi... maybe you didn't notice  the hesitation in my eyes I crave to tell you how i love and how i hate the storm of cloudy thoughts  that make my head spin that make my heart race but after two years of hiding without reason i feel the thoughts im thinking are useless afraid you've found the one for you someone else to be you're completion... where are we now? because without you is not who wanna be can we walk hand in hand once more?  or are my hopes just floating on a cloud as they seem to do  when what you are hoping for is something pure something true now im looking to the stars searching for strength in the sky hands pressed tightly agaisnt my knees praying that somewhere within you love for me hasnt found a way out embrace it, please just try or time and time again i'll fall apart seeing what i have pushed aside proving that in love hasty decisions are brave but nowhere near smart i guess this is me trying to be brave so let me tell you a little story  about something i love  and something i hate i hate the way that i can't stop loving you knowing that my confession is far too late     yeah, some of you might understand this...some not...

      i didnt know until recently how much your life can change in a matter of weeks. So much has happened since this summer began... The first day of summer, well the night after school got out, i hung out with people who were soon to become practically my family (cat, ashley, erin, ingrid, sarah, and john). We got together right after school, and all of us went to eat at Pae Wai (duno if thats how u spell it or not). after that we all pretty much just hung out all night, and ended up having a COED-SLEEPOVER at cats...this night is something i will never forget. okay, stepping back into the past a bit.....i recently before the sleepover lost my best friend to what he thought was making him look cool...drinking...now he is a totally different person and i can barely stand to be around him. Knowing that a person can change himself so much just to try to impress, really sucks. anyways...moving back on to the future that is now my past (confused? ) that night at cat's i grew a close bond with all the girls...not knowing that it would only grow stronger the more that i was with them. We stayed up all night and had an awsome time, while filming our true insanities so that we could watch them later in life. At 6 in the morning, ingrid and i decided we would go buy kolaches and donuts for everybody. Then she, john, and I headed up to northshore to hang out at about 6:42...then we came back to cats and gave those who were asleep a rude awakening to HANSON!  they were pissed...but it was all fun! When that adventure finally came to its end, i started to realize that i was making the best friends i will ever have....but i did have much doubt that it would last, because i had already lost so many friends to stupid things.   MEMORIAL DAY 04' :    all of us got together again to have a BB-Q at northshore park, and that was when northshore became our official hang out. we had hot dogs, and a lot of laughs...and also got this day on film as well... we hung out for like 4 or 5 hours that day. we ate, we talked, we joke around, we wrestled ...all of the above, there in assuring me that i would not lose my friendship with these girls...that they would not just leave me standing here when they found something more "impressive" to do...they have become my family...i know i can never really get hurt, because no matter what i have them... they have recently helped me get through some tough times, and i love them all to death for being there for me. From here on out, it seems like the only changing in life, will be for the better...  thank you sooo much...

      wow...its been forever and a day since i have written in here. As usual, im very bad at keeping up with things like this! especially since im working...work has really taken over stuff like this, the little things i used to randomly do everyday. anyways. The past few weeks have been wierd, kind of an emotion-trip....so lately i have been feeling extremely distant from everyone, hence having alot of time where i feel kinda alone(a time where thoughts pour throughout your head). Have you ever wanted something so bad, while knowing that it's something you cannot obtain. well there's issue # 1 for me...im not going to get into specifics. I just hate it when all odds fall against you in the one moment where u really are hoping otherwise. if u are reading this, its probably not really making sense...meh... i really feel like i need to start writing again...i have had writers block for the longest time now. Im starting to feel all that emotion and thought fuel up again, so maybe soon i will have something new posted up on here. maybe not... i duno. im guna stop whining...bye
