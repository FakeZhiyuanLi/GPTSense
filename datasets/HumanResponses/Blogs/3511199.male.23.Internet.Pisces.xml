      As my script was running through gigabytes of data, spitting some weirdly encoded information, I was feeling very bored to sit staring at the monitor and running commands like  "ps x", "ls -lh some_arbitrarily_long_path", zmore some_zip_archive  etc  for the umpteenth time just to see if the process (also me) is alive. Just then I got reminded that my friend had asked me to buy something from M.G. Road. Wow! What a wonderful reason to go to M.G. Road.   The timing could not have been more apt, it was 5:30 PM and a gentle drizzle had just stopped making the setting perfect. I walked along the pavement gazing at the huge buildings (believe me!), crossed the Mayo Hall and Symphony Cinema Hall and finally reached the opticals shop, all the while watching people and listening (no deliberate over hearing) to all the languages spoken in Bangalore. The crowd primarily consisted of young couples  with dreamy eyes walking hand-in-hand, making hush-hush statements in mostly English. I was wondering if English is the  lingua franca  of 'modern day' Love or if these couples don't have a common native tongue.  I bought the contact lens cleaning solution and was returning back to my office on the opposite pavement. Long after the end of the 'colourful' Brigade Road area, my eyes caught the sight of a bright young couple standing in a place unusual for such meetings. The girl appeared to be highly animated, so I stopped for a while and watched. Having been exposed only to the good old Doordarshan and having been forced to watch every program relayed by them on Sundays including the 'News for the hearing impaired', I could recognise the sign language she was using. Oh! I realised that either the girl is dumb or the boy is deaf or both. The question I had about the language of Love is long gone from my mind as I walked back to my office ...

       urlLink  ... hibernate?    	This was a pseudo-random thought that happened when I was chatting with my friend. First consequence I could think was that life (as in human life) would become a lot slower, because more and more people will start opting to hibernate to escape the troubles in life. The thought at the back of their minds would be that, "time as we define it, largely a creation of humans, has to move on, even if I as an individual don't exist for a few days and hence all the troubles have to move with passage of time". This is a logical extension to the thought behind drinking (alcohol, of course!). Escapism seems to be a basic human tendency (does it lead to the conclusion that humans are inherently weak?).  	One mundane consequence of the trend towards hibernation would be that, companies may start giving hibernation vacations to employees!

      Any body who has travelled on Airport Road (in Bangalore) to office would know how the traffic moves (or should I say it doesn't?) in the morning hours. One such morning, I was fortunate enough to get into a mini bus supposedly meant for the private use of a MNC, but was made available for the general public by the benevolent driver (of course with a cost!). As usual, the traffic was seemingly in a state of perennial infinite static inertia.   At this juncture, we heard the siren of an Ambulance van behind us. The remnant humanity in us plus the very nature of the siren made us look back anxiously. Our driver commented in Tamil that the ambulance driver seems to be inept in pushing aside other vehicles and moving ahead. As he was saying this, he started doing some exceptional driving stunts and after repeated honking, eye contacts with other drivers and some verbal abuse, he cleared the way for the ambulance and signalled the ambulance driver to go ahead.  I was overwhelmed emotionally on seeing his act just when he commented "every day if I get such an ambulance to tail behind, it would be great i.e. all signals will be thrown open for the ambulance, which can be exploited by me".   I sat speechless ...

      Once I was chatting with my brother. We wondered if what I 'see' as green is same as what he 'sees' as green. We were all shown a particular colour (which we may perceive differently) and were taught the name of that colour. So, we all agree on what's green, for example. But, how do we perceive 'green'? What I perceive as green may be perceived by you as the equivalent of my 'blue'. How do we find out if our previous hypothesis is true or not? At that point of time we were not aware of Godel's incompleteness theorem; we almost reinvented it (though the essence of the theorem has been around for a long time in the metaphor 'kiNatruth thavaLai', a frog in a well).   Later, I suggested that if ever there's a poet who can describe the colours in a way even a person born blind can differentiate, then we can test the hypothesis by making the poet describe the colours (essentialy the poet's own perception) and we test if it matches our perception. Little did we realise then that, for this to be possible, either the poet has to break the incompleteness or colour of light should not be an orthogonal property (one which can't be expressed in terms of other properties). With my creative skill level at absolute zero, I am still wondering if someone who's blessed with such poetic skills can ever confirm or deny this fact ...  Besides colour is just another instance of human perception ...

      ... Something very tempting is close to your hands, too close to resist. Everyone in the bus is fast asleep. So is the girl next to you. You browse over her sub-thoracic region. There lies your object of desire. But, oh, all the moral instruction classes you had every Tuesday in your school tell you not to have it. You turn the other way around trying to fill your mind with something else, but to no avail. You suddenly feel that all that your moral strength can do is to delay your yielding to temptation for a few minutes more.   Time passes by. There's total silence. You start feeling something which you are not clear as to whether it's your heart beat or lung movement. Just as time is running out and you are almost sure of the ignominy that might follow if you yield to your temptation, the driver switches the lights on. Your pupils take some time to adjust to this. The conductor cries in a loud voice, "Salem! Salem! Get down". The girl gets up and runs to the door, with the object of your desire, a big size 'Dairy Milk Chocolate' in her pocket! You heave a sigh of relief, "what a difference between this moment and the moment before!" The bus moves on...
