      Hey people, how were your weekends? Mine was okay; same as usual. I woke up early yesterday, because Mom had to show some properties. After she finished, I came back home and blogged about how those appointments went. I was within an inch of posting that particular entry. And then my computer froze. God, was I annoyed. But yes, I did try to post yesterday. However, my computer malfunctioned (the idiot machine) before it registered, so I didn't succeed in my mission. I'm too aggravated to bother with restating the entire experience I talked about yesterday, so unfortunately you won't hear about what happened with Mom's new Indian clients. It's not that big a deal anyway. Just another example of the dangers of relations with Indians.  Today is Sunday, so of course I went to church. That went pretty well. Hmmmmmm...There's nothing special to say about it actually. Well, nothing that I haven't said already. What's the point in dwelling on things you can't overpower, right?  After church, we (Mom and I) went to Waltham, Massachusetts. My church is in Burlington, and Waltham is about twenty minutes from there, so we stopped by the condominium we own in Waltham. Mom had an appointment with this Indian guy named Sanjiv. She was supposed to show him the condo, to see if he wants to buy or rent it.  Before I continue, here's some background info about Sanjiv: Sanjiv, my friend, is a guy with truly low self esteem.  The first thing he says to a complete stranger (my mom, in this case) is, "Madam I work in Hospital. I am not doctor or anything. I am secretary. Please give condo to me. It is good for me. I am good man, even if I no have status. Okay Madam?  ji-hah  Madam. Thank you Madam."  And then he proceeded to call my mother all day yesterday to make sure she hadn't changed her mind about meeting him, "because of [his] status." So confident of him.  Here's my poor mother's opinion of him: "I think he's gay, Lavima (my nickname). He talks in a feminine manner. [Just like Sai Baba]"  He's also very bossy. He started yelling at Mom because he wanted to know if she was going to park in the street or in the condo complex parking lot. Seemed quite impatient. Although, that was possibly because Mom made him wait in his car for fifteen minutes while she went shopping. Yeah, that might have done it. Either way, she yelled back (he was across the street from us) saying she would turn our car around and park in the complex. She told him to follow her. So naturally he took the lead (another one with male dominance issues, no doubt), and ended up bringing the ten cars behind him to a dead stop for five minutes, while he figured out which way he should go. In order to stop the impending riot, Mom honked at him to get his attention, and received, along with his, the unwanted attention of most of the peeved pedestrians' and angered drivers'. Mostly to avoid the looks of bloody murder directed at Sanjiv, she brought him to the condo in two minutes. I love my mother.  After all of that, he saw the property and said that he'd talk with his uncle and get back to her with an offer, or something of the sort. Good luck dealing with him, mother dear.  And that was my Sunday. Extremely exciting, don't ya think? I can barely contain myself, just thinking about it. I can't wait to have another two years' worth of Sundays just like it. Yay for me.   Antes de  I forget, I should mention that my best friend is Poire, whom I met in sixth grade. She has her own blog, which you can visit at  urlLink http://geeky-girl.blogspot.com . I started my blog at her recommendation.  Speaking of Poire's blog, I think I'll go and make some comments on her posts. That should entertain me for awhile, since I can't call her. She's in Massachusetts with her grandparents, probably spending lots of quality time with her strictly Catholic grandmother. Lucky her. Anyway, until next time everyone.  Au revoir!

      Hello, my nonexistent fans! How are you today? I hope you're good, because at least SOMEONE should be. Before I jump into the woes of my life: I created this blog to flirt with the possibility of creating an opportunity to develop my writing, in case I seriously decide to be a writer. Okay! Now that that's out of the way... Hi. God, I am so screwed. What have I done? Why? Why?? I HATED him. Okay, fine, I despised him! I badmouthed him, I called him a monkey! And now I'm in love with him. Hello cliche, it's a pleasure to meet you, especially since you've made my life so wonderful thus far. Yeah. Great. Thrilling. Here's the real problem: We go to the same church. He's the pastor's nephew. I'm the only child of a single mother, who's currently divorced. My father lives in Australia. In Indian society, my mother and I are outcasts! His family is perfect. Not a single divorce. His two sisters are perfection personified. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY thinks they're the next best thing since bread. I'm really friendly with cliches today. Me? I'm nice, but I'm not considered as perfect as they are (I think). Don't get me wrong, I love them dearly, but i have to admit: It sucks. God, August 24th will mark two years since my baptism, and the day I realized I'd completely fallen for him. It's driving me nuts. I've considered, SO many times, just forgetting about him. It doesn't work. I can't stop! It's so unfair! Over the last year, I've seen him twice a week, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings, at prayer meetings. Lately we haven't been going on Saturday nights, because Mom doesn't feel comfortable coming home around eleven pm or twelve am (We get home so late because we live an hour away from church). For the last five weeks, I've seen him once a week, on Sunday morning. He shaves on Sundays. He usually doesn't shave on Saturdays. God I miss seeing him when he hasn't shaved! Okay, to clarify, I will be sixteen on October 3, and he'll be twenty on April 20. Also: I have an obsession with his facial hair. Don't ask me where it all went wrong, because I'm as clueless as you. Up until this whole love thing happened, I despised men with facial hair. Speaking of which, he's on AIM right now. I'm thinking about whether I should IM him or not. I refuse to without an excuse, which I don't have, so I guess I should/will not. See, we're not allowed to talk, otherwise I might get a bad reputation, or everyone in church will gossip about us, and our...whatever thing we have, will be doomed from the start. I feel like I'm walking on fire, you know? It's like, wow, this could happen, we could end up together, BUT. There's always a "but." I mean, Pastor has said things that imply he wants us to get married, but couldn't it also be wishful thinking on my part?? That's where the doubt sets in. Luckily, I am strong in my Christian (pentecostal, to be specific) faith, and an optimist to boot, so I don't make myself too miserable, and believe that things will work out. Of course they will. There are just those times, when it's difficult to reassure myself. I spend all week convincing myself that he's not that great, and he's boring, masochistic, chauvanistic, a jerk, pig, monkey, etc. Then he looks at me once, and I'm mentally begging him to take me away because I'm his, completely his. It's insane and underhanded, the way he makes me feel, I tell you! There's an electric charge when we make eye contact. I can't stop blushing and smiling when he's near me, and believe me, it takes a lot for me to blush, considering my skin is not really the blushing kind. Just seeing him walk into the room makes my heart start beating so loudly I'm surprised my mom hasn't insisted on seeing the doctor about it. Not that she's heard it, which is, incidentally, the most surprising of all. I wish he would kiss me. It's really unlikely that that would ever happen before we got married (if we got married, actually), since he doesn't believe in dating, but I still wish, deeply, that he would. I'm dreaming of him every night, and thinking about him everyday, all day. He's the second thing I think about every morning (God is first; church does that to you), and the second to last thing I think about every night (again, God). Every time I see him, I always hope. My god, I can't believe that this entire thing is real. It seems like the kind of thing one would see as the plot of a blockbuster hindi film. Wow. I am now mentally exhausted. I am currently lacking the endurance needed to blog, so I'll leave you all (yeah right) with this: I have no idea what to do. I am used to being in control of myself, and having a plan, and now....now I have no plan but to wait, and that doesn't count as a plan at all, because it doesn't involve action. Talk to you later people!
