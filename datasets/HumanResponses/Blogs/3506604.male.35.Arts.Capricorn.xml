      Littlehampton, England has the longest days of anywhere that I have lived. The sun is in the sky by 4 a.m. in the morning and there is still some daylight at 10:30 p.m. I have almost forgot what night looks and feels like. I believe that all the daylight may be contributing to my better than average moods lately. That is not a bad thing.  The better moods that I have been experiencing may also account for the increased production of my art. I am knocking out at least three new paintings a week. This is also a good thing. One thing that is puzzling me a bit is this weird feeling I have been getting when starting a painting. It is almost a fear of the blank canvas. Not a massive dose of fear mind you, but most definitely fear. I can plan out the canvas and have a plan on execution but when I get in front of the canvas I somewhat freeze up. Once I have the layout and initial paints on the surface it goes away and I feel fine. Until that point I am a bit anxious. It is just strange, I have been creating art forever it seems and this creeps in now. On top of that it creeps in at a time when I am producing at such a high rate. Weird indeed.  I got a call today for a mister King. I receive a lot of calls for Mr. King. At first I figured a guy named King used to have our telephone number. That seems like the logical answer, right? I now know different. After finding out that there is no Mr. King the person on the other end of the line starts giving me a sales pitch. That's right folks, it is impossible to escape telemarketers. Even crossing an ocean does not stop these tenacious phone intruders. At least it is one more thing to make me feel at home. Maybe during tomorrows call I can request that they speak in an American accent so I can get the full effect and help with homesickness.  Homesickness, I finally have it. We live in a very small town. The only things in the town are the marina, the amusement park, the beach, and The Body Shop headquarters. I probably would not feel as homesick in a larger town. The breakfast restaurants and coffee shops do not open here until 9:30 a.m. I miss being able to get up early and go grab a coffee with Faith, sometimes at 5:00 a.m. if we were both up. I feel bad for the guys that work in town in the shops. The shops open at 9:30 also. In the states the breakfast and coffee places opened before the rest of the retail establishments to get the employee business. By opening at 9:30 the coffee shops actually miss out on most employed business, retail or not. Most people not in retail start work between 8:00 to 8:30. No grabbing breakfast and coffee on the run before work here.   Another thing that is weird is we have Pizza Hut and KFC over here, but no Taco Bell. These are all owned by the same parent company. In the U.S. you can easily find restaurants that combine the menus of the three for variety. I don't really want KFC or Pizza Hut, but I could really go for a chalupa. Back to being born under a bad sign thing I have going. The incredible bleeding Peacocks shirt, the lack of Guinness at my local pub, and now the lack of chalupas. It is all becoming clear now.   As I wrote in an earlier post another thing that I miss is sports. I also wrote that I am trying to get into football(soccer) for the Euro 2004 tournament. For those keeping track England lost their first game to France. England was ahead by a score of 1-0  until after regulation time had expired. While in the added three injury minutes France scored twice and won. Both scores were given to them by England. One was a free kick and the other was a penalty kick. It just does not seem like England want it bad enough. We will see as England play their second game tonight. They have to win the next two to have a shot at moving on in the tournament.  Well, I said that was going to be random thoughts and I always deliver. Check back next time for a more focused entry, I promise.  Be seeing you, Eban  urlLink ebancrawfordstudio.com

      I am listening to The Circle Jerks right now. Old school punk is refreshing to listen to at times. For one thing it brings me back to my younger years when punk and old-school heavy metal helped to shape my youth along with an intense love of classical music. The punks of old laid out their views for all to see. I don't agree with all of it anymore but it is still great to hear people that feel strongly about topics voicing their opinions. When I was younger I was a diehard liberal. As I aged I went through a brief affair with conservative, right wing thought, that is now also my past.  Even though I now associate myself with the Libertarian party I also like to think of myself as a person of free, independant thought. After my flirtations with right and left wing ideology left me a bit jaded I started to look at things through my own eyes. Everything I see and hear now is filtered through my internal bullshit meter. I form and express my own beliefs and thoughts independent of "party" lines. Even as I am a Libertarian, I still do not give in to libertarian ideas without examining all sides to a subject or problem before making my own conclusions. I believe each person has a responsibility to themselves and their nation to form their own beliefs and to study subjects independent of their politicians, representatives, and media. One thing that I believe above all is that debate, true "DEBATE", makes us stronger as a nation and as individuals. My problem right now is that I see a future where debate and individual thought will be suppressed or destroyed altogether.  These days our country is still very much a two party system. In local and state elections the smaller parties such as the libertarians and green party have made inroads but in the national arena, the big two still reign. These days the big two seem to focus more on grabbing power than running the country. The tactics of the Democrats and Republicans have created a country of division rather than one of unity.  In the name of multi-culturism, political correctness, national security, immigration,foreign policy and several other programs and ideas, free thought and debate are being destroyed at an alarming rate. The government (both liberal and conservative sides),of our country is close to regulating and criminalising thought while taking away freedom and privacy as we know it, All in the name of doing what is best for us. My internal bullshit meter is screaming alert signals right now.   Just look at both the left and right sides of the media. On the left you have NPR, the Network News, CNN, and Air America. On the right you have Fox news and most of the AM dial. The thing that I hear most while listening to these programs is the level of hate growing in our country between the two ideologies. There is very little difference between Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken. Neither seems to have anything positive or constructive to say. Neither seems to have a plan to make the world or country better. They just seem to be consumed by the need to discredit or destroy those on opposing sides. That is a shame to me because both seem like they could be strong,, happy, entertaining guys if they let go of the hate. They both have strong ideas and beliefs that could be used in debate to create a stronger America. Al Franken is a comedian for goodness sakes. He seems to have lost all his humor these days and that is a shame. Another thing that I see is the depths that the two ideologies are willing to go to destroy or hurt the other, all at the expense of free thought, freedom, and debate. It is a horrible mess. There was a time when two people could disagree, talk or argue their points, then either shift views or agree to disagree. After the debate, they could still see each other as valuable, intelligent people rather than an object of opposition that needs to be dominated or destroyed.  We have become so intolerant of others, sometimes ironically in the name of being more tolerant. I have several friends that fall on the right or left ideologies. I have friends that are atheist, Christian, and other beliefs. I have friends from multiple ethnic groups. I have friends from several different nationalities. I manage to disagree with them on several topics. I love debating subjects with them and in the end we are still friends. Actually, our differences and the ability to openly discuss and argue these differences is what makes the friendships stronger. As a country we need to get rid of the building hate between ideologies and begin to make our country strong and unified again. Unified because of and in spite of our differences.  I remember a story told by Matthew McConaughey about a meal he shared with the late Carl Sagan during the filming of the movie Contact. McConaughey, who believes in a higher power, said that Carl Sagan laid out the argument against there being a god by using science and astronomy as his evidence. After Sagan had laid out his hypothesis on atheism McConaughey had his turn. McConaughey used the exact same evidence of the natural wonders that Sagan had laid out as proof of god. Obviously these two gentlemen had completely deferent views. The thing is, they did not use this disagreement as a reason to try to discredit or smear the other. Instead they finished the meal, finished the movie, parted as friends, and as McConaughey explained the situation, gained a respect for each other and each others views. That is how it should be. I truly believe that with all of my heart.  Be seeing you, Eban  urlLink ebancrawfordstudio.com

       urlLink My Way News  Story in link above... Today a great man has passed away. With the passing of Ronald Reagan my thoughts drift to this years presidential race. There is no winner for the people this year between the two major party candidates. Reagan was a special man and leader. We can only hope that one day we have another like him instead of the two jokers competing for our votes this year.   Goodbye Mr. Reagan, we will miss you!  Be seeing you, Eban

        I miss American sports. Really, I do. I love sports and due to being brought up in the states I have very little concept of the sports offerings over here in England. Football(soccer) is just not that big in the U.S. Another sport that is fringe at best is rugby. Don't even get me started on Cricket. I am doing my best to immerse myself in these sports as fast as I can. I am actually getting a pretty good understanding of soccer and rugby. Cricket confuses the hell out of me. I think you have to be brought up with it to even have a shot of understanding. Oh well, even I can't understand everything.    Euro 2004, which is being held in Portugal this year, is about to start. This tournament is "HUGE" over here. Euro 2004 is the soccer equivalent of our Super Bowl or World Series but is actually bigger as this is Country vs. Country. England, captained by David Beckham, seems to have a shot this year. The national pride building up over here can be physically felt.  I felt I should support my adopted land during this.(As Scotland, my ancestral land, is not in it this year) I went to my local retailer of sports clothing and bought an England ballcap and shirt to show my support. I wore the shirt one time before it was ruined. In the first washing the ink used in printing the England flag and logo ran all over the white shirt. My question is this, if you buy a shirt from a store named Peacocks does it mean that the shirt feels a need to be colorful?  Anyway, I am still supporting the team, although I am now effectively topless in doing so.  This is not a total bad thing. This is the first place that I have lived where I have more natural skin color than the locals. I look downright exotic with my white self over here. That is actually more sad than good but it is what I've been saddled with.  As if the shirt incedent was not enough, I soon realized that my early hypothesis on communication with the locals was a bit flawed. I actually believed that we would have an easier time communicating here than when we lived in Germany. Here we share a language, right. Wrong.  In Germany nobody expected us to be able to communicate freely right from the start. That in itself was liberating. The locals helped Faith and I out with words and phrases and before you know it we were communicating pretty easily. Over here the shared language is the problem. Don't think that you can watch BBC America for a couple of years and understand U.K. language and accents. It just does not work like that.  First off, there are some pretty extreme accents here. Nothing feels worse than looking someone in the eye that is speaking english and not catching one word. Unlike when we lived in Germany it would be rude to ask for help understanding the language. I am sure that I have looked idiotic, or at best like I have bad gas when speaking to some of the locals. I am trying not to get a tag as the local simpleton so I need to work on this.  One thing that BBC America does succeed at is preparing you for some of the word differences here. Thanks to "The Office" I now know that fanny, as we use in fanny-pack, has a whole different and not too nice meaning over here. They have "bum bags" instead. If I had not watched The Office I would be left wondering if that was the british equivalent of the equipment used by our "bag ladies". Cars here have "boots" and "bonnets" instead of "trunks and "hoods". If a car has a "boot" and a "bonnet" where are the "soiled undies" located?  With the love of beer here you would expect to find some great imports on the shelf. This is not really the case. You can find Fosters, a couple of German beers, and a couple of others but it is mostly local brews here. America has one great contribution to this all, Budweiser! With everything we have worth exporting from our country, this is our gift? It is so sad. Even the locals here know Bud is pretty rank. I have come out of the beer situation alright as my favorite beer is Guinness. I should be completely happy, right?  Every bar and pub here serves Guinness. It is great. We have a pub at the amusement park  right across the street from our flat. We really like this pub as it is clean and has good food. The staff are all cool and treat us as locals already. What could be the problem here you ask? This pub may be the only pub in this country that does not serve Guinness. How is that for being born under a bad sign? They do serve Murphy's which is similar but come on.  I am trying not to connect the lack of Guinness at my local pub with the incredible bleeding Peacock shirt. I don't believe there is a message in there. I actually like it here and Faith and I are starting to fit in better. I am sure that we will settle in just fine after this period of adjustment. I now know not to ask for "pants" when shopping for jeans and I have come to understand that there is no such thing as a good sausage or hot dog here. I guess it is just how you look at things. I live in a third floor, three bedroom flat in a converted Victorian across from an amusement park and have great views of the English Channel and the River Arun. I have nothing to complain about. Ok, I do but it will all work out.  Be seeing you, Eban  urlLink ebancrawfordstudio.com

      There is a spooky picture making it's way around the internet right now. The pic is of Eddie Van Halen. As most of you may know, Van Halen has reunited with Sammy Hagar and are going to tour this summer. You may also know that Eddie recently battled cancer and to the delight of music fans appears to have won.   One of the things that I remember hearing through the gossip columns was that Eddie refused to quit smoking during his treatment. I do not know if the gossip was true or not but it was also put forth that this was one of the reasons for the breakup of his marriage. That of course is just a rumor, we do not know the truth or fiction of the statement.  The picture is haunting me a bit. Eddie does not look very good. Not only has he just battled cancer but he was a serious drinker for most of his career. Why is this any of my business you may ask? It is none of my business. It just got me thinking about my situation. For those of you curious, here is the pic.    So, just what is my situation? If you have read my bio on my  urlLink website  you may know that I love powerlifting and that I also had a personal training business in the 90's. During that time I also wrote a book on weightlifting and fitness. Looking at Eddie made me realize how we can slip if we do not take care of ourselves. Even if we do take care of ourselves we are not guaranteed health, but we do hedge our bets toward a healthy life.  Now even though I have been into weightlifting and fitness for years I have never been slim so to speak. At some points I actually let myself go a bit too much. My bodyfat used to run between 15 to  18%. Add to the picture that I am a big guy from powerlifting and it is safe to say that nobody would ever mistake me for an underwear model. My thing was health. In addition to lifting I also ran 5k races, enjoyed biking, hiking, and climbing. My best placing in a 5k was a top 25% overall finish in the Houston Marathon 5k in 1999. That was not too bad for a big guy who only ran as a side note to lifting.  My situation took a downward turn just over a year ago when I herniated two lumbar disks and received an annular tear. In reading my MRI the doctor also informed me of degeneration in three other disks and the onset of arthritis. That day sucked! It was a combination of wear and tear and a freak, bad luck accident that caused the damage. For some, surgery would be the answer. I chose to live with the condition and to manage it through exercise and other means. I will only go under the knife for a problem like this as a last resort, there is no going back after surgery.  Unfortunately the best laid plans sometimes do stray from course. It was about this time that my wife and I moved from Pacifica to Burlingame, CA. Also, it was around this time that my wife started to get hints that a move to the U.K. might be a possibility. My back pain was getting no better and I was in a funk.   As the funk got longer and longer, I got more and more out of shape. By the time that I finally regained control of my situation I was the fattest that I had ever been. Being too embarrassed to get it checked, I can only estimate that I had reached 25% or more bodyfat. If I were a bit more brave and sure of myself I would give the address to my sister-in-law's website that has pictures of me from a trip to London that are less than flattering. Oh well,If I am going to write this I need to be honest so the pic is below. I was letting myself go and at 35 you just can't do that and get away with it. As you age it does get harder to rebound when it comes to health.    Well, I did stop the downward spiral before crashing into the ground. I figure that I am now around 20-21% bodyfat again and going down. It is evident in my bio pictures that I am not back to my ideal yet. I did not do anything radical, I just started my life again. I got my workouts back on and started moving again. My back is strengthening up well and is feeling better than it has in over a year.   All of this happening recently plus seeing the Van Halen picture made me want to write this. I was going to put advice on taking control of your health here but then rethought that plan. I want this to be more about the decision to do something rather than getting technical about what to do.   Step back and take a good inventory of yourself. Not just physical but the whole package. Do things now that will carry you into the later years of your life healthy and strong in mind and body. It could be cancer like Eddie, or destroying your back like in my case. Be prepared for these things by taking care of yourself. I was lucky, even though it is harder to rebound at 35 than 25, it would have been even harder at 45, 55 ,65. Even though I was doing things that were good for me by lifting and eating well, I was neglecting other things that could have saved me from going through my back problems. We only get one body to go through this one life, Live that life the best that you can!  By the way, Eddie, it is nice to have you back. Go out there and show today's youngsters how it is done!  For those of you out there looking for cutting edge, no bullshit information on health go to the  urlLink Testosterone.net  site. This is my favorite site on the web. The guys that run this online mega-library of fitness technology are topnotch and the information on the site is vast, on-target, and free! Be warned, it is a bit irreverent, just how I like it!

        Here in the U.K. there is a new T.V. show on BBC 3 that is becoming one of my favorites. The show is the brainchild of comedians Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt. The show is named for their duo comedy act, "The Mighty Boosh".      The show premiered on May 18, and has kept me in stitches ever since. The premise is simple. Noel and Julian play zookeepers at the trippy and weird Zooniverse. Nothing normal seems to happen there, and nobody seems to notice anything is off. Noel Fielding plays Vince Noir, a laid back easygoing guy stuck in the seventies with great hair. On a side note, he can also talk to animals. Vince refers to himself as "Mowgli with flares". Julian Barratt plays Howard Moon, a self-important nice guy nerd with delusions of grandeur that refers to himself as a maverick. It is most often the case that Howard is on the receiving end of all the weird happenings such as boxing with a killer kangeroo or being mistaken for a gorilla by the grim reaper and being brought to monkey hell. Vince's hands are full usually having to bail him out. The other characters in the show are equally memorable.    There is Naboo, the shaman and dealer of junk souvenirs. Naboo cryptically seems to have all the answers to each weeks dilemma. Bob Fossil is the zoo manager, an American that hates animals, Vince, and Howard. He was brought up by a strict military mother that served in "Nam" and he is a bit unstable. Mrs. Gideon, the snake keeper, is the object of Howard's unrequited love. Dixon Bainbridge is the unscrupulous and greedy owner of the zooniverse that also hates Howard but is somewhat keen on his ugly girlfriend Vince. You get the picture.     Fielding and Barratt comedy is based on the fact that these guys will say and do anything. You cannot predict what will happen next on this show, they even break down the fourth wall occasionally and talk directly to the audience. The show being based in a magical, trippy zoo sets up a perfect scenario for these two guys to go for it. The timing and obvious friendship between the two are the product of honing their craft live on stage  for seven years or so.    The thing that I like best about the show is that for all it's irreverence and oddity, it can be watched by the whole family. The show is "PG-13" at it's worst and usually stays well above that grade. These guys have managed to make a cutting edge in your face comedy with nothing overtly offending or shocking. This to me is like a breath of fresh air in this climate where entertainers seem to think that to be an innovator one has too out "Shock" the next entertainer.    Don't get me wrong, I am no puritan. I am waiting in line like most guys hoping that Britney makes that multi-million dollar deal with playboy. I still enjoy South Park and gross out comedy on occasion. I just like the fact that these guys worked a little harder and found a real, unusual, and innovative comedy voice. The fact that they created an edgy new show without having to resort to that extreme is to be commended.    As I said, I still like some of the shocking acts out there but too often these days people with no talent or story to tell resort to shock methods to look creative. Janet's wardrobe malfunction, Britney and maddonna's kiss, and so on. Hey, if Janet's song was even half decent she would not have had to resort to the shock. Her album sales reflect the weakness in her new music. Guys like Julian and Noel are showing the strength of their material.    The Mighty Boosh shows new episodes on Tuesday night on BBC 3. Check it out if you have not already. For those in the states, call BBC America and request it. This is one show that is worth it.

        I just ordered a case of canvases for the studio. That felt good. I have been without a full functioning art space since January due to the move to Europe. Everything moved so slow during that time. We only recently received our household goods from the states. During the time without my equipment and paints I did a few watercolor paintings just so I would not go stir crazy. It did not help much.    Watercolors are not my medium. I do not work well with them as the application is the exact opposite of the way that I paint. I paint with bold strokes and place what I want into a painting. With watercolors, the painting is delicate and more about what is left out rather than what is put in. That being the case, I did do some passable work in that time. I also did some horrible work that needs to be destroyed!     The passable work that I did led me to an idea of sorts. I am not going to present the watercolors to galleries as they are not up to my normal standards. At the same time I would hate to throw them away since they do represent a time in my art career. I guess that I have to give them away. This is an early announcement of the new contest from the studios. I am giving away two of the water color paintings that I did in that time frame, also one small promotional acrylic from San Francisco. I am not going to make the "official" announcement until I have worked out the details of the contest. It will be another guestbook contest, that is all that I know at this time.    I have completed three new paintings since setting up my studio. I believe that these are among my best work yet. I will try to get pictures up on the site as soon as possible. I have decided to stick with landscapes more than other subjects for the time being. Of all my work the landscapes get the best feedback. I will still occasionally throw in a portrait or a fauvist abstract from time to time but the landscapes are my bread and butter, The people have spoken!    For those that have modeled for me, I am not forgetting about you. I will be able to use some of the shots in my landscapes when the subject is right. Plus I may get commissions in the future that I will be able to use the shots.     Speaking of art, I am a little ticked off right now. I recently saw some art that really pissed me off. Under the title of modern art some people are getting away with murder, so to speak. For every person, such as myself and many other talented artists, that produce art that is not representational but of a somewhat abstract nature, there must be a hundred or more artists that are producing crap with no talent and are passing it off as masterworks. The reason this aggravates me is this. Some people understand non-representational art. In my case I manipulate color theory to produce my works. It took me a long time of trial and error and study to form my style. Most people do not understand this and believe that if you do not create art that is 100% photo-realistic, then you cannot paint.     These people's ideas about art are fueled by the moronic "modern artists" with no talent. These are the guys that produce crap, total crap, sometimes even using crap or worse. These artists have actually managed to form part of the artistic elite in some cases, In other words the "Artistic Snobs". To these people producing art that is decorative, pleasing, or heaven forbid commercial is a sin and removes your right to be an artist. These guys use phrases like "I use my excrement in my painting to show how downtrodden the world has become due to the industrialization and the rich sticking it to the poor and helpless due to the Christian faith which causes all pain unlike Buddhism and love man". They can actually spew that kind of crap without breaking into laughter. It is amazing to me.    Gauguin, which is one of my idols, once said, "All art is decorative, really". Monet and other impressionists used to paint large wall panels as well as bedroom screens and other decorative room elements. They even dared to show these alongside their gallery works. As`a matter of fact, most of the artists that were considered cutting edge in the late 1800's and early 1900's were just as interested in producing art that was not only pushing the limit, but that was also commercial and decorative. Another fact is that the art of the impressionists onward pushed art away from being 100% representational of the world around them. You can thank the camera for that to some degree. Since the camera could produce pictures of the world, artists felt free to produce art that showed the world the way the artist saw it, or wanted it to be seen instead of accurately representing it.     Please to the people out there. Judge art by whether you like it, not because someone says it is an important piece or that it is magnificent. Art should be pleasing to the viewer. Use your judgment, if you think it stinks, it just might. Art is like wine, drink what you enjoy, not what some elitist says you should enjoy.      Well that is my beef today, I at least tried to keep it coherent. I know I strayed in some places here and there but I think you get the point. Keep looking out for the details of the contest.
