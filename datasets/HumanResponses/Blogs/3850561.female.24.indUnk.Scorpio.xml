      wednesday....just finished yet another night of wine and happas....today was south africa....nothing exciting....food was greasy.....wine was good....clientele the same as always....pretentious and wealthy with a sense of entitlement that i am beginning to have less and less tolerance for....speedy gonzales (my nickname for the little columbian chef that's sweet on me) continues to woe me with extra vegetables on staff meals and "oohs" and "aahs" when i enter the kitchen with dirty coffee cups.....i don't understand what's so appealing about dirty dishes....juan, one of the guys i serve with, witnessed speedy's efforts by spying through the window and he seems to find it equally as creepy as i do....i try to not look at him (easy as he is at least a foot shorter than i am), make sure i don't come within a whole metre of his person, and say i am busy anytime he calls my name.....but after a month of giving him the cold shoulder, he perseveres.....maybe i should try this uber-bitch method on boys i really like....maybe there is some truth in the whole playing-hard-to-get thing....either way, it is progressively getting more and more creepy and i think i need to either have a good face-to-face with little speedy or have management talk to him...it's riding my nerves....  my boss also said that i induce a sense of guilt in him when i look at him....like i am accusing him of something....like he's done something wrong.....i couldn't possibly tell you what he's done wrong...i don't really care for that matter but it is an interesting comment....he's not the first to comment on my way of looking.....my old boss found it seductive and this new one finds it guilt-inducing.....some say it's just intense....what can i say?.....i just look....directly....maybe that freaks people out....  for the rest, i haven't much to say....my days consist of beach and work....my nights of sleep and disturbing dreams...i wake up more tired that before i sleep....but for the rest, i'm ok....i eat well....i rest (i think)....i've lost 4 kilos....and the family is alright....they don't drive me crazy....the maid cleans my room....my mother makes me breakfast and lunch....how will i ever survive back in holland with no maid and no mother?.....haha....i'm sure i'll be fine....at this point, i still see it as a luxury....the minute i see it as normal, i'm likely a lost cause.....  so here i am, at one o'clock in the morning, behind this screen....cognac....and no desire to sleep.....missing all of you who read this blog....  dames, bedankt voor je berichten....jammer dat ik niks terug kan sturen....hoop dat alles goed is in maastricht zonder mij.....juud, laat me ff weten als je&nbsp;mijn sleutel al hebt....moet namelijk iemand hebben die me post uit de bus kan halen en mijn inschrijving voor de uni opsturen....mina, hoe ging het bij vodafone???....heb je nu werk?....smelly, hoe was barcelona?....  R, dank je voor je berechten...je zorgt dat ik me altijd populaire voelt.....hoeft niet maar als je iets wilt sturen, woon ik op cas coraweg 41, willemstad, curaçao, NA....  superstar, was leuk om met je chatten.....1...2...3....4....ja....uhunh....maar ff iets anders....persevere!.....het gaat je allemaal lukken....een veel plezier met je tractors en koeien (sp?)....mis je....  &nbsp;

      diane ackerman, in her book&nbsp; the natural history of love , claims that 74% of married american men cheat....i wonder if european men cheat more than americans or less?.....and what about antilleans?.....i'm not sure if culture and socialization influence the percentage of cheaters but i am sure that socialization and culture do influence the expression and form of cheating....cheating is a broad term.....it could be anything from&nbsp;one night stand to a short fling to a long-term mistress....what has surpised me here in curaçao is the openness with which it happens...i often serve a regular and his wife on an evening that entails only an entree and house wine....and three days later, the same regular is back in doing the app, entree, dessert thing with expensive wine but the woman with him is not the wife.....she is usually young and spanish speaking here.....maybe gold-digging....maybe not....another guy came in alone and waited for his girlfriend...they chatted, drank, cuddled, kissed for an hour and then she left....ten minutes later, his wife came in....they chatted, drank, cuddled, kissed for an hour and left together....i'm not really surprised by this all.....but what surprises me is the openness.....do these guy know others won't tell their wives or do they not care if their wives know?...that's my thought for today....

      every wednesday passeniers does a wine and happas menu...they pick a country and then build the wine menu and apps accordingly....last night was spain....and they turned it into a a big tapas buffet.....tortilla, abigodias, oyster pasties, huevos atun.....good food.....but it was crazy crazy busy....normally we close up at around 2330 but last night the place was still full at midnight and before we got everything done (and we didn't actually get everything done) it was twoish.....but what's nice about working on nights like yesterday is that the sense of teamwork is much greater than when everything is manageable....and, at the end of the night, we sat down for a few drinks and chatted....we ended up going to tmf&nbsp; for a few drinks and today i am tired as hell....woke up too early....so...passeniers is getting less boring with one less person on staff and nights like last night....i know the regulars and they know me which makes it more fun....and, since i am the only girl working evenings, i get all the leftover chocolate mousse as peter says that girls get cranky if they don't get chocolate....so it's good....can't compain....i've been here and a month and i haven't really wanted to go home yet which is a positive thing....i could probably live here....the mix of dutch people and antilleans and columbians and americans and tourists is appealing....u can speak dutch, english, spanish and papiomentu....would be good for my spanish....curaçao is like a developing country in a lot of ways but, then again, fairly westernized.....who knows....maybe in time i will live here....s  R - bedankt voor je smsje....was heel fijn om een berichtje te krijgen naar een maand withdrawal...hoop dat alles binnenkort wat beter gaat....mis je....

      keys and money.....two things i hate....two things we would not need if people were innately good, honest and fair....but hey, what can you do.....my family locked me out of the house this morning and while most houses are easy to break into this one is not....stupid bars..... &nbsp; it's sunday morning...my day off....yippie.....the rest are at church and i am here.....ben leaves tomorrow so we have to do a lot of packing but he is quite ill....i hope he will be able to get it done and be able to leave tomorrow....would suck for him if it didn't work out....we didn't manage to go out before he left.....probably better....mambo sucks anyway...it's like holland on the beach....the only good thing is that they play 50 cent everytime and that makes me think of robby and trying to learn the lyrics under the influence...and that makes me laugh....but it's not really worth going....not for one song..... &nbsp; wondering how things are in maastricht....dames....geef me de roddels.... &nbsp; i'm off to make some breaky....take care.... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      last may the place i was living in was broken into while i was here in curaçao....one of the things that was taken was my stereo...what i had been listening to the night before i left was david usher and the cd was still in the player so, when they took my stereo, they also took my david usher...which i haven't been able to replace...until today....my brother had burned a copy from my sister last year so i burned it and listened....and almost cried.....david usher is many things to me....it reminds me of a time that in many ways doesn't seem that long ago and in other ways seems like a whole other life....it reminds me of late nights and port and love and an intimacy i will never be able to replace....it also reminds me of grief and the pain of knowing that you can't be with the most important person in your life....there were months that i couldn't listen....and i have to admit, it's never become easy to listen to....david usher was a part of my life before certain doors closed in my mind and in my heart....and in that sense, it symbolizes my greatest loss....sure that sounds really dramatic but it's not.... &nbsp; on a related but less tragic note, ben also had a copy of my howie day cd, which i no longer have due to a certain cat pissing on it....that too makes me happy.....hurrah for muzik! &nbsp; and donny.....xxx

      hola....friday afternoon....ben leaves on monday....scary....we're going out tonight with ben and his friends and the boys from de tropen have invited me to go out as well which will be good.....good fun....talked to mina today....was good but i got a half-story on the george thing and it all seems so weird....can't wait for the details cuz apparently he seems to think differently than i do about his abrupt disappearance from my life....what's a girl to do?....boyz....boyz....in the end we have noone but ourselves (thx R).....and that's just fine....work is still work and not very interesting...it was dead last night and i have concluded that we have approximately 30 regulars that seem to think they own the place....you know the kind that demand crushed ice when they know you have no ice crusher....the kind that order stuff that's not on the menu cuz they know they will be accomodated and the kind that refuse to move when you say "excuse me....can i sneak by you"......they are also the type of people that walk into the kitchen and holler in dutch at the poor columbian kitchen staff and, &nbsp;upon being met with blank baffled faces, simply repeat the same words but in a much louder voice as if volume increases understanding of a foreign language.....they are also the type of people that feel entitled to touch you wherever whenever cuz they are paying....this is obviously the epidomy of food whoreness.....not that i am totally bothered....i can put up with a fair amount of arrogance....but i must admit that my meekness is not innate and is more a matter of just holding my tongue while my insides scream.....the joys of dealing with the rich and pretentious who fail to understand that i take shit for nine nag an hour.....

      been thinking a lot about the concept of home....what makes a place home?.....and more specifically, where is  my  home?.....being here and living in a house with the same people as when i was growing up and the same furniture and the same paintings on the walls seems kind of like home....hanging out in the garden while my brother's friend, patrick, plays beuatiful songs on the very same guitar that the first boy who broke my heart played seems like home....so maybe curaçao is home?....but then again, an afternoon in the take with de dames also seems like home....as does a little indonesian dinner at my apartment.....as does my afternoon cup a coffee with basje....so maybe maastricht is home?.....but....sunday afternoons in don's basement with a cosmo and a maxim and spinach dip and croissants and red chillie jelly is also home....as is sunday night dinners at the ames-hodgson-christiansen residence....all these things give me a sense of home....but they are never all in the same place....i guess home is not a place....not here, not maastricht, not edmonton but rather home is sense of familiarity and belonging.....if i had my way, i would put all these things that make me feel at home on one nice little warm island and i would have my ladies from maastricht and my family and my scandanavians and donny and linds & co. and basje and the rest all in one place....wouldn't that be nice?....yup....  on a totally different note, my little brother is leaving in five days and this makes me kind of sad.....it's good to hang out with him and he's kind of all grown up and knows so many people and is so well-established here and i really really like spending time with him and actually learning about his life and his thoughts and his feelings cuz i really don't know him when i am there and he is here and we chat or talk on the phone....everything is always so censored....hopefully when he's in canada we can keep in better contact and,who knows, maybe i can go visit him and leah and donny and linds and kristy and adam and rob and rory and all the rest in december.....maybe....  ben and this guy lars came to pick me up from work last night and the place was pretty full with industry people, all of which ben seems to know...we ended up leaving passeniers quite late and went to my boss, alfredo's place....it is a gorgeous place...roomy, open, balcony, garden....nice....very nice....we hung out while alfredo looked at porn and the rest of us watched nip tuck...not very interesting but fun none the less.....  oh...and i lied about the picks being on the site....i'm having problems uploading them which is not surprising given the 56k modem....yes....ancient......i'll try to burn them to disc and upload somewhere via cable....cool?....  alright...i'm off....be well all....en tot snel...-s

      hi....pics are on my yahoo....click on the link to the left and you'll get to see them....  alright....an update....  came home saturday night right pissed about this guy that i work with that like to be a table hog.....and ends up screwing me out of the money i am supposed to be making.....i was livid....so....we went to mambo but it wasn't really my thing that night....and when we were done there we went to denny's.....yeh for denny's.....yippie for american greasy spoon....i even ate bacon.....scary eh?.....  i spent my day off doing practically nothing....watching shit hbo movies and reading.....nothing exciting....  yesterday i was back at work all pumped up to talk my manager about the unfairness and the table hogging only to find out that martin, my sweet manager and favourite person to work with, had quit....i guess he was fed up....one of the owners is his ex and he basically gets treated like shit and i think i would have quit too.....but it kinda sucks for me cuz work has gone back to being boring and now table-hogger is going to play mr. manager....  last night patrick and his little sister came over and sat around way at the back of the yard with a bottle of wine, a guitar and ton of bats that were flying all over the place....it seemed kind of reminiscient of the campfires we had when i was a jaded angst-ridden teenager....it was good fun....  today i am off to the beach with da girls....and then off to boring old passeniers....yippie....miss you all....xxx

      larissa said that it was probably a good thing that i'm not working at de heeren....and when i asked her why she said "because there are a lot of eligible bachelors there"....such a comment seems ironic.....if they are bachelors and if they are eligible, why is it better that i don't meet them?.....not that i am out looking but it seems absurd that one would think that eligible bachelors are an innately negative phenomenon....just a thought....

      so...this morning i woke up with the my first curaçao hangover....hell....i went to de heeren after work yesterday for ben's goodbye party and we headed out to tmf with patrick, raphael, martin (my manager) and couple of others....tmf is like stagaire heaven....holland in the caribbean...just like mambo...i drank no more than i would normally drink....however, making a highball in holland consists of a single shot of your favourite distilled liquor plus a whole lot of your chosen mix....the way it works here is a) lots of ice; b) lots (and i mean lots) of, in my case, gin; and c) a wee teeny tiny little bit of tonic....so it hit me hard and the world was spinning and it was rather unpleasant but...i had fun being out....martin is a cool guy and working has become substantially less boring since he's been back to work....but the restaurant is still slow and the men are still creepy and pretentious.....oh and i have a rant....let me start by saying that a server is not a slave....people with money tend to forget this....and i hate that....i served these people yesterday....young...new money...no class....they were complete assholes....they treated me like i was dumb, incompetent and a piece of meat....not cool at all....i was told to treat them well because they tend to tip well but i don't give a shit....my pride dictates that i am not putting up with demeaning, snide and sexually inappropriate comments for a couple of extra bucks....no thank you....so they got the bare minimum....enough that they wouldn't complain about me but much less than what i normally do....and i hate that....learn some decency....learn to treat all people, and especially those who work in service industries (servers, teachers, social workers, call centres), like actual people with personalities and feelings and lives....these assholes have probably never worked in such industries so perhaps they are ignorant (they were after all americans) and can be forgiven....or perhaps they have worked in services industries and somehow money has made them forget which would be totally uncool....yes....the joys of being a food whore....someday this will have to end and i will become a real person and people will stop talking at me like i am a retard....i cannot wait....

      yesterday morning my mother woke me up and informed me that i had fifteen minutes to dress, eat and get to the hairdresser, who was going to do her best to get this red out of my hair....after a failed dye, highlights and two and a half hours, i walked out not quite a blond but close....so yes, ladies and gentleman, i am on my way back to my real hair colour....right now it's pretty funky...it's red and it's blond and it's just about a little bit of everything and the minute i find my dad's camera, i'll snap some pics and post them....  i worked last night (big suprise)....made some decent money in tips and sat around on the porch with ben and a bottle of wine....was good to chat....i think late at night is the only time i will really get to see him before he leaves....tonight is his goodbye party and i will be heading over to de heeren as soon as i am done work....it's the first time i will have been in there since i gave marc the bad news and i don't think marc is really mad at me....i hope not at least....  i'm off to wake up ben and get my stuff together for the beach.....i hope the rest of you are doing well and i promise the pics will be along shortly.....xxx

      good afternoon....today is sunday....surprise....i tried to update earlier this week but i couldn't log in....which really sucks cuz i felt quite inspired....and now i do not....but hey....the update....  14 days to go....mixed feelings about where i feel better....but i honestly think that maastricht and curaçao work well as homes....maybe i should do both.....my grand partner in crime (alfredo) is off in aruba this weekend so i am just laying low and catching up on some sleep....a week and a half of work to go and, although it is sometimes a whole lot of  fun, on the whole, i am little tired of working six days a week.....but hey, it's easy and the boys are fun and peter is back from columbia and stock is in again so maybe things are looking up for the brasserie....who knows....as long as they pay me!....tips have been alright but not fantastic....the odd american with their 20% is always encouraging.....but the sit-around-all-night-drinking-difficult-to-make-cocktails-and-leaving-seven-guilders has kinda been the norm the last while.....too too too bad....my father says that tips stands for 'to insure proper service' and i agree....i am much more willing to do a little extra if i know said client is a good tipper....how awful is that?....the epidomy of food whore....haha....

      slow night at work last night and whoever set the mix last night must have been in a slit-my-wrist mood as it was depressing and sad and all about lost love and lost family and what not....i've gotten quite used to it but it is usually interspersed with a little bueno vista social club and latin american stuff....not yesterday....none the less, at the end of the night i sat with my glass of wine while waiting for juan to finish up and got thinking....thinking about what brought me here....what life has been like since i first left maastricht in february....about my travels and about what the last two months on paradise island has done for me and meant for me....today, i am all alone at the house with a little sarah slean....hanging in the yard with a book and my thoughts flow again....i am much better than when i came here....a lot more chill....a lot happier....a lot less stress....the money hassles are pretty much resolved....or at least overseeable now....but i wonder what things will be like when this vacation ends and i am back at home....being away so much has given me a lot of time to put perspective on things......and to realize that the recurring theme for me this past year has been disappointment....and this makes me wonder if disappointment is self-created or something that happens to us....it also makes me wonder if disappointment is linked to high expectations or whether the disappointment in my life is a result of a self-fulfilling prophesy....an expectation to be disappointed....u know the realism idea when you conclude that you can't really count on people....and i really don't know actually so you tell me....where does disappointment come from?.....  on another note, peter, one of my bosses that deals with all of the financial stuff, decided not to come back from columbia as he was planning too....this leaves us severely in the shit....we're running out of stuff and there is no money.....and i can't help to wonder where the money is disappearing to.....shadey businesss......i hope i get paid out this month...and i hope i still get the remainder of my july salary.....who knows.....

      good evening....i know....it's been a week....probably longer....and i know it's not like me not to write....but in all honesty, i don't know what to write on this blog anymore....all too often i feel censored....my own issue of course....  the last week has been a week of grand insecurity....my work didn't pay me out on the first as they should have and five days later i got a cheque that wouldn't cash.....fortunately no nsf cheque cuz my mom went in person to the bank....but the fact of the matter is that i worked the last week not knowing if and when i would get paid out....which has done absolute wonders for my diminishing work morale and has made me less than kind to the boys i work with....it's like a pool of sharks....everyone just trying to get what they are entitled to have....i got the greater majority of my money last night....cash....the whole thing is sketchy....the one who takes care of the money is in columbia and we all wonder if he'll be back....either way, i better get paid this month as well....cuz this screwing around with your employees' money/writing bad cheques thing is not so cool....  moving on...  the last week has also been a great deal of fun....i've been spending some good time with alfredo....who is good and kind and (as mentioned prior) lots of fun....and hanging out with someone you feel that comfortable with makes you realize that you can leave the country, move away, take on a new life, and still you remain the same....you never lose yourself....so what this means is i am back to late nights and g&t......i don't mind because in the end it's not about partying....it about people and relationships and good friendships and i am happy to know the people i have met here.....even if it means i have crawl in the door at seven am....tonight was my night off and we went down to the coast, sat on the water and ate fantastic italian.....and why?....because i said that i really missed that sort of thing given that i work six nights a week...so yes, things are good here and i think i will miss some people....and i have built some memories....things to look back on and smile about....my own little film.....and that's a good thing....  in addition, larissa and my mother left for miami this morning.....i hope they have a fantastic time and it's all too bad that i saw so little of larissa while we were both here but work and dengae (sp?) fever seemed to get in the way.....sucks eh?.....  alright, i'm off to smoke a ciggy.....find  my dog (wonderful loyal beast that he is) and go to bed.....ciao

      good morning...i have been up for about fifteen minutes and have had two grand moments of stupidity....first of all, i got up and walked around the house looking for my mother, my sister, my father....anyone....nobody is here....nada....and i thought "that's weird".....and then i realized it's sunday....of course they are not here....they're at church.....secondly, i woke up thinking i forgot the two bottles of wine i bought at work last night in alfredo's car.....but they were nicely on the kitchen counter....how can i simply forget that?.....the answer....gin and tonic....i think....so....i've been out two nights in a row with alfredo who is one of my bosses and a good friend of ben.....and it's fun....alfredo is kind, funny, generous and ridiculously dirty-minded.....and he has rob dokter syndrome....he gives everyone the impression that they are, at that moment, the most important person in his life....good stuff eh?....we went out to tutu tango on friday and he took good care of me....shooed the yucky men away and observed the cute ones with me.....last night we were at mambo....saw a lot of the same faces we saw at tutu and ran into a couple (dick and petra) we had seen the night before....so the four of us had a good time, good conversation, good fun....i enjoyed myself....  this evening the boys i work with (juan and rugerio) are coming over to eat....i hope my head can handle it today....  uhm....  dames, ik bel jullie over een uurtje....1 uur hier, 7 uur daar...dan is juudje klaar met werken.....  r, bedankt voor je sms....ik ben precies hetzelfde....maak je geen zorg....bbq klinkt leuk....had er bij willen zijn....doe de jongens de groeten van me....
