      Here is a good article by Mark Earley of Prison Fellowship Ministries on the Homosexual Marriage debate.  He frames it as a matter of justice: weighing the rights of the homosexual individuals versus children.  http://www.pfm.org/BPtemplate.cfm?Section=BreakPoint_Home&Template=/ContentM anagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=12511    ______________________________________ Scanned by Inflex & McAffee Antivirus  Queries to: hostmaster@iiserve.com

      Howdy all, Here's the latest...  On Thurs June 17 at 7:30 the Youth will be headed to Fun-N-Stuff for some go-cart racing.  We'll meet at the L'Heureux's and go from there. Mark your calendars and invite your friends!  Summer Trip: Plans are coming along.  We're gonna leave for KY on Sat July 3rd early (maybe 6AM).  It is about a 6 hr drive.  In KY we'll be putting a roof on a small house/cabin and possibly building a side room.  In addition, there are going to be youth and singles from that area who are going to be meeting and possibly working with us.  The area that we are going into is one of the poorest in the state.  In order to prepare, each person going will be required to go to a thrift shop, such as Goodwill, and purchase an outfit to wear on the trip.  In addition you will need to find and get something from a dump or that has been set out as trash by someone else.  Then take that item and clean/fix it up for either your use or to sell in a garage sale that we'll have.  The purpose of these exercises is multi-fold.  First, it will help you to know what it feels like to have to do that when you are poor thus second will help you to have compassion for the shame and or embarrasment that can be felt by people in need. Third it will perhaps show you that you would be able to do this if you had to.  When we go, we cannot have an attitude of superiority, but rather an attitude of service.  In addition some of the college age and older will be asked to prepare short presentations to give to the group (us and them).  We'll travel on the 3rd, set up and get logistics settled etc. On the 4th, we'll be going to Louisville where they claim to have the world's largest fireworks display (or perhaps largest at least in the area - I'm not sure) along the river.  We'll picnic, swim, possibly have hot air balloon rides, maybe tube a river etc. We'll then be working for a few days to finish the roof etc. From there some will head back to North Carolina for white water rafting and other activities.  I may need to head back home at that point because of work.  One other note, for bathing suits we'll have some rules this time: Females will have to have either one-piece suits or two-piece that look like one-piece suits.  Males can't wear speedo's :).  Those planning to attend: Justin P Hannah Erickson David Althausen Jennifer Althausen Hillary Althausen Tessa Cirincione Becky Althausen Jonathan Althausen Chad Johnston Plus around 25 from KY  All for now...more to come... -Nathanael  YS STUDENT E-MAIL NEWSLETTER #134 May 24, 2004  Contents 1.

SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART  You may not know it, but many of us in the older generations keep an eye on you and your peers. We are inspired and motivated when we see you do something significant. We cheer when you set new sports records. We marvel at your science projects that make ours of long ago seem too juvenile for Fisher-Price. We may not always let on, but we watch and take pride when you stand out.  Recently there have been a number of articles on something your generation is doing much better than we ever dreamed of: cheating.  We thought we were being creative when we taped answers to a ruler and shoved it up our sleeve. But you guys have learned to program formulas into your calculators. You peel labels off water bottles, write answers on the back, and then glue the labels back on. You can text-message back and forth without looking conspicuous. And you quickly discovered that camera phones could be used to take photos of a test to send to a friend or even post on the Internet.  You personally may not be a cheater, but about three-fourths of your peers admit to some kind of "serious" cheating. And the few who choose not to cheat either don't want to tell on those who do, or don't feel their efforts will do much to eliminate the problem.  You've heard all the reasons why cheating is bad: "You're only cheating yourself"; "Just because others do it doesn't make it right"; "God values honesty." Yet cheating is as bad or worse now than it's ever been.  (If nothing else seems to work, ask yourself the next time you're in a dentist's chair looking up at a drill: "I wonder if someone like me helped this guy cheat his way through dental school?")  The topic of cheating raises a question that will come up again and again in your life. If you can get away with something without getting caught, will you do it? It won't be long before, if you choose to, you can drink all you want, overindulge in junk food, do drugs, have sex, buy or view porn, or anything else. Just because you can, WILL you?  You probably know good, decent people who left home for college and got involved in such things right away. Will that be you? If you discover you're cheating just because everyone else does it and you can get away with it, who's to say you won't eventually use the same line of reasoning to get involved in something worse?  Finals are coming up. Now's as good a time as any to start doing the right thing for no other reason than you choose to do so. As soon as you make that bold, final decision, you'll experience a freedom that cheaters never attain. Besides, we're watching you and hoping for the best.  On your own ...  Read Acts 5:1-11. http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NLT&passage=A cts+5%3A1-11  The story of Ananias and Sapphira is an extreme example, to be sure. But what does it tell us about the severity of dishonesty and cheating when it drifts into a church setting?  2. SURF REPORT  ~ It's a Good Question "Why is Christ the only way?" That's Beth's question. Maybe you've wondered the same thing. For a straightforward, easy-to-understand answer, look no further than this site. http://www.passageway.org/qnalink_r.asp?q=129  ~ Memorial Day Memorial Day in the United States is much more than a three-day weekend that marks the beginning of summer. To many people, especially the nation's thousands of combat veterans, this day (which has a history stretching back all the way to the Civil War) is an important reminder of those who died in the service of their country.

      Yo!   In an effort to keep up with the latest technologies and trends, :) I've added a blog (Web Log) to the website that is for the youth. There is a link on the High School Ministries page (www.fconline.net/myouthhs.htm) and it takes you to the blog: (http://fconline.blogspot.com). These newsletters will be posted there along with other items of interest.  I've got to get into the swing of using these things so we'll see how it goes!    So far for this Summer now I've heard from the following people who've said that they want to go:   David, Jen, Tessa, Jon, Becky  I believe that Justin P and Hannah Erickson will be there as well as others.  -Nathanael  YS STUDENT E-MAIL NEWSLETTER #133 May 17, 2004  Contents 1.

This devotional is not made up of warm fuzzies and easy answers. Based on a book by Oswald Chambers, "Everything Counts" will dump the easy pleasantries of religion and lead you to real faith and a real Savior, and bring you the reality of what it really means to be God's child.  http://www.youthspecialties.com/linker/index.php?id=3238  Also available at your local Christian bookstore.  =================================   1. SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART  "What are the odds?"  Have you ever said that after making an unbelievably incredible shot on the basketball court or golf course? Or seeing a rabbit cross eight busy lanes of interstate traffic without a scratch? Or tossing a coin and having tails come up seven times straight? Most of us occasionally experience or observe events that, if not downright miraculous, certainly seem to "beat the odds."  The world of statistical probability is a fascinating one. Some people sit around all day and try to determine precisely what the odds might be for any given occurrence. For example, they tell us the odds of your becoming president are 1 in 10,000,000. Your odds are better for becoming a pro athlete: 1 in 22,000. And if you'd be happy just catching a baseball at a major league game, your chances are 1 in 563.  For those of you considering gambling as a career, the odds are against you. If you're counting on winning a state lottery jackpot, you have only a 1 in 4,000,000 chance. Being dealt a royal flush in a poker game? 1 in 649,739. Even at the roulette table, the odds of your number coming up are 1 in 38. If by chance you do win big, the odds of being audited by the I.R.S. are 1 in 175.  And guys, no matter how frequently you dream about it, the actual odds of ever dating a supermodel are 1 in 88,000.  Yet no matter how extreme the odds, some people are determined to try. They keep buying lottery tickets. They keep gambling. They keep hoping beyond hope to bump into Niki Taylor and start a long-term relationship.  But when it comes to our spiritual lives, we need to be clear on certain statistics. For example, what are the odds of a person committing a sinful act that will put him or her "at odds" with God? According to Romans 3:23, the odds are 1 in 1. "All have sinned; all fall short of God's glorious standard." How many actually deserve to die because of their sin? Again, 1 in 1. "Death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned" (Romans 5:12).  That's why pastors and church teachers place so much emphasis on putting faith in Jesus. Those who do so move from the 1 in 1 odds of death, to a 1 in 1 confidence of eternal life in heaven. Paul assures us: "I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes" (Romans 1:16). And don't forget John 3:16: Everyone who believes in God's Son will not perish, but have eternal life.  The chances of a meteor landing on your house are 1 in 182,138,880,000,000. But those odds are nothing compared to hoping to find a way into heaven other than yielding to Jesus and seeking his forgiveness and redemption. When it comes to salvation, the odds are simple. Jesus is the one sure thing in this life. With him, you can't lose. Without him, you can't win.  On your own ...  Read John 14:6-14. http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NLT&passage=J ohn+14%3A6-14  Based on what Jesus told his disciples, what do you think he would say to those who claim there are many roads to God, heaven, and eternal life? Why do Christians elevate Jesus above Mohammad, Buddha, Krishna, and other religious figures when other religions may be willing to place them all on a more equal status?  2. SURF REPORT  ~ The Cross and the Chrysanthemum: Christianity in Japan How did the news of Jesus Christ reach the Land of the Rising Sun?

      We are less than a week from the summer trip and most of the major plans have been set and the questions of who is going are more or less settled.  Just talked to Debbie last night and she was changing the schedule slightly to have an activity on Monday during the day...  Anyhow the list of people I know going: David Althausen Chris Althausen Hillary Althausen (These three will be there for just the first part) Hannah Erikson Justin Powlison Jennifer Althausen Tessa Cirincione Becky Althausen Jonathan Althausen Chad Johnston David Bentley  Plus of course me, Emmy, our kids and Debbie. There is also a chance that Pastor Norm will be going for part of the trip but that is not fully confirmed yet.  -Nathanael  YS STUDENT E-MAIL NEWSLETTER #139 June 28, 2004  Contents 1.

If anyone has ever asked you this question (or if you've asked it yourself), you know it can be hard to explain or even really understand your faith. The Case for Faith, by Lee Strobel, talks about some of these tough questions--and offers answers. You'll get insights that will help you understand the Bible, and read true stories of people whose experiences demonstrate that faith in Jesus makes a life-changing difference.  http://www.youthspecialties.com/linker/index.php?id=3573  Also available at your local Christian bookstore.  =================================   1. SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART  "You're not the boss of me!"  In recent years, this has become a popular phrase. Perhaps you've heard a defiant sibling direct this statement at you, or possibly at your parents. Maybe you've even muttered the statement yourself on occasion.  And when you think about it, surely some variation of this phrase must have been used by the American colonists way back in the 1770s. After sailing all the way across the Atlantic on rickety boats to secure a bit of freedom for themselves, they quickly grew tired of England's imposed taxes, rules, and expectations. So in between the lines of all the eloquent statements in the Declaration of Independence, the simple message it sent King George III was, "You're no longer the boss of us."  Yet as soon as the Revolutionary War was over and the newly created United States had won its freedom, the leadership started writing the Constitution, electing a President, and making rules to live by. Why ruin all that wonderful fresh freedom by imposing a bunch of rules?  What some people fail to realize is that genuine freedom does indeed require rules, as well as someone to enforce them. Certain restrictions must be imposed. What would happen, for instance, if someone wanted to exercise freedom by running his SUV through a red light while you're peddling your Schwinn through the intersection? The "stop at a red light" rule exists to protect both of you.  Therefore, freedom is achieved not by doing away with rules altogether, but by exchanging one leader and set of rules for another. The American colonists exchanged King George III and the English monarchy for a democratic republic with elected leaders. What the U.N. is hoping to do in Iraq is replace the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein with a fresh and liberating system of government for the Iraqis. Both systems have leaders and rules, but one set is oppressive while the other is liberating.  Similarly, on a personal level, exhilarating freedom is found by giving up a selfish or worldly perspective and determining to follow the rules that God has established. Some people feel that the very fact that they are expected to follow rules diminishes their independence. But anyone who has committed to following his or her own desires and whims for very long will tell you that experiences of peace and freedom are few and fleeting.  Only the unconditional love and unshakable strength of Jesus allows us to experience genuine freedom. Your commitment to receive the salvation and redemption he offers is immediately followed by his declaration of your freedom from sin. From then on, he is the leader in your life and you agree to abide by his rules. But it's the most liberating option you'll ever find.  Jesus taught, "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other" (Matthew 6:24).  So consider your level of satisfaction with your personal, spiritual freedom this Independence Day. Then ask yourself, "Who IS the boss of me?"  On your own ...  The Book of Galatians deals with the theme of Christian freedom. It's not a long book. When you have a few minutes, read straight through it and then go back and think about the portions that strike you as most important.  2.

SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART  Here's a brief reflection on the song "The Way" by Telecast:  "You are the Way The Truth and Life You are the only way for me."  Are you going to heaven when you die? I read the results of a survey the other day that said the majority of the people in the United States thought they would be going to heaven.  But when asked why they thought that, very few said it was because they had repented of their sins and made a personal commitment to Jesus. Most people said they were confident of heaven because either they had been a good person or God was too good to send anyone to hell.  Well, God is good, so good he made a way for you to go to heaven. But it is not good works that get you there, it is the blood of Jesus.  "Jesus told him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me'" (John 14:6).  Jesus didn't say, "I am A way." He said he is THE way to the Father. I tell people all the time, "If you want to go to the heaven of the Bible, you have to go the Bible way. And that way is through Jesus Christ."  But Jesus is more than just the way to heaven, he is the way to fellowship with the Father. He is the way to the comfort of the Holy Spirit. He is the way to life.  "The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give life in all its fullness" (John 10:10).  The key to abundant life is fellowship with God through Jesus Christ. How do you have fellowship with God? Spend time in His Word. Read it. Obey it. Spend time in prayer. Go to church. Be kind to others. Let the love of God flow through you and you will know him better each day.  In the song "The Way," the group Telecast sings about the only way they will go. That way is the way of the Lord. Listen to the song, make your commitment. Follow Jesus and get to know the Lord better. Spend some of your time today with him. Make it your goal to live conscious of his presence every day. That is the way of life; it is the only way for me.  (Suzy C.)  Daily Reflections from Solid Sounds, copyright 2004 The Good News Broadcasting Association, Inc. (Solid Sounds). Used by permission.

      Yo,   Here's the latest on the summer trip: We're leaving Saturday July 3 and meeting up in KY. We were going to replace a roof, but that got done already due to it being ripped off during the recent bad weather. We are still going to be doing some land clearing for work but now the trip has shifted focus to more of a spiritual work trip vs a physical labor work trip.   We were and are planning to have a meeting for and with the local youth on Monday evening.  But in addition the local church that we'll be working with asked us to have a service for the whole church as well on Tuesday night.  So here's how it will go down.  Some of the college-agers who are going are being asked to prepare a short (15 min) presentation to give on Monday night to the youth.  There are several topics that they will be doing the presentations on.  The high-schoolers will be doing a skit each night.  We'll also be doing the music (so get your instruments and vocal chords ready :)).    Each morning, we'll have a time for every person to have a quiet time and we have some materials that we'll be studying together.  We'll eat breakfast and then have a group meeting with our people.  Then we'll have our day events and evening events.  On Saturday, since we'll be traveling, our first meeting will be in the evening just to gather together, get situated, pass out materials etc.  On Sunday, the 4th of July, we are heading to Louisville KY for picnic, tubing, river play, possible hot-air balloon rides and fireworks.  On Monday during the day we'll be 1) going door-to-door inviting youth for Monday night and everyone for Tuesday night 2) Land clearing In the evening we'll be having the meeting for the youth. We'll do the music, have one or more short presentations, a skit and probably have hang-out time afterwards.  Tuesday is similar to Monday except that the evening meeting will be for all ages.  On Wednesday, I need to be headed back to Ohio, but those with more time will go to North Carolina with Debbie for various activities.

Something for Your Heart 2. Surf Report 3. Forgettable Fact 4. Potent Quotables 5. Parting Shot   ===========our|sponsor===========  IS YOUR FRIEND IN TROUBLE? Your friend comes to you and confesses that she has an eating disorder or that her parents are breaking up. You're left speechless and don't really know what to do. Pick up a copy of "How to Help Your Hurting Friend"--it won't have all of the answers, but it will help you find ways to be a good friend by showing Godly love and support to your friends that are going through tough stuff in their lives.  http://www.youthspecialties.com/linker/index.php?id=3397  Also available at your local Christian bookstore.  =================================   1. SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART  "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).  Big Time Wrasslin'? When I sent a complimentary e-mail to a friend, he responded, "Thanks. BTW, I'm still looking for that source."  Now, if you look down at the bottom of this devotion, you'll notice that my initials are not BTW. My highly intelligent coworker had obviously made a little error in my identity. I thought about pointing it out, but then realized that perhaps it was I who was slightly ignorant. So, I did what any sophisticated, smart woman would do. I started surfing.  Possibilities abounded on the Internet. "Big Time Wrasslin'" was my favorite, but maybe what my friend had meant was the "Brothers of the Third Wheel." Nah. He's a sports fan, but I doubt that he's really all that interested in wrestling, or in an international triker organization.  Perhaps he was displaying his vast knowledge of other languages and he meant "Büro, Technik und Wissenschaft" or "Belasting op Toegevoegde Waarde"? Hmm. Probably not.  I know! Maybe he was in the middle of reading a biography and accidentally typed in Booker T. Washington's initials by mistake!  All kinds of acronyms and jargon are out there. They're handy. If we have to, we'll slowly figure out the code. Pretty soon, we're using it ourselves. Christians have their own jargon. But to be effective in our witnessing, we need to be clear when we talk about our faith with non-Christians. A person shouldn't have to go to Christian-language school to figure out the gospel message. Or to guess that the Trinity means "three Persons in one God." Or that repentance means "to turn your back on a former way of life." Or that sin means "to disobey God."  A good verse to use in telling others about Jesus is John 3:16. It's been called the "gospel in a nutshell" because it gives succinct information on how to be saved. Saved. There's another one! Instead of saying, "Would you like to be saved?" why not say, "Would you like to make sure you go to heaven when you die?" We are showing respect to others when we care enough to communicate our message clearly.  Oh ... by the way ... BTW? It means "by the way." But, of course, you already knew that, didn't you? (Cindy Kasper)  Here are some questions to ask yourself: ~ How does it make me feel when people talk in unfamiliar acronyms and jargon? ~ How do I think others feel when I do it? ~ Do I find myself using jargon when I talk about my faith? How can I be more clear?  From Soul Journey, copyright 2004 RBC Ministries Grand Rapids, Michigan. Used with permission.

FORGETTABLE FACT  The audio book version of the King James Bible is 84.5 hours long.  4. POTENT QUOTABLES  Every generation of Christians has this problem of learning how to speak meaningfully to its own age. It cannot be solved without an understanding of the changing existential situation which it faces. If we are to communicate the Christian faith effectively, therefore, we must know and understand the thought forms of our own generation. - Francis Schaeffer  I should warn you, if I turn out to be particularly clear, you've probably misunderstood what I said. - Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  Incomprehensible jargon is the hallmark of a profession. - Kingman Brewster, Jr.  5.

      Wow!  Was that ever an excellent trip!! God spoke to us, challeged us, gave direction, expanded our horizon, got us fired up.  We had opportunities to serve, learn, give and grow. And we had a great time doing it all!  I thank God for the donations toward the trip that provided the hotels for us all and some other bonuses!  I am thankful to all those who drove: David, Chris, Emmy, Jen, Tessa and Debbie.  I'm thankful for the hard work on learning music, skits and preparing presentations.  High points of the trip included the times we got to serve: 	Sunday morning, Tuesday Evening (many people said that was one of the most meaningful); and times God spoke to us: 	prayer meetings (ranked by some as the best part of the trip), Bible study; and times of fun: 	Mammoth Cave exploring, white water rafting, the latin/Cuban restaurant  On Sunday, we heard from many about what God spoke to them/what they learned or what was the most meaningful/important.  I'd like to get those written up because they serve as a reminder of what God did and an encouragement to us all.  So if you spoke Sunday or not, please send me a short summary of what you learned or what was the most meaningful/important part of the trip for you.  What I found to be interesting was that each part of the trip spoke to someone whether the music, each of the presentations, the prayer, the Bible study etc.  Thank you and may God greatly bless you!! -Nathanael  YS STUDENT E-MAIL NEWSLETTER #141 July 12, 2004  Contents 1.

The truth is - your parents were actually your age once. Believe it or not, they went through a lot of the same junk you're going through now. "Read This Book Or You're Grounded!" gives you the help you need to understand your parents. Using interesting stories, practical information and specific action plans, author Wayne Rice will help you improve your relationship and communication with your parents. You'll learn about understanding, getting along, special needs and concerns, and how God fits in through it all.  http://www.youthspecialties.com/linker/index.php?id=3681  Also available at your local Christian bookstore.  =================================  1. SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART  Okay, so here's the deal. You're 47 years old and are doing fairly well financially. You know a 90-year-old woman who lives alone in a rather nice house. You figure she's not going to be around much longer, so you offer to pay her $500 a month as long as she lives, provided you get her house when she dies. If she agreed, would you make the deal?  We like to think that certain risks we take are "sure things," yet life proves us wrong again and again. This very deal was made in France in 1965. The 47-year-old man was a lawyer, so he wrote everything up, sat back, and waited. And waited. And waited.  In fact, he waited until 1995. That's when he died. The woman, in the meantime, was still going strong. Her name was Jeanne Calment, who is now in the record books as the person with the highest age ever authenticated. She celebrated her 122nd birthday on February 21, 1997, and died the following August. By the time of the lawyer's death, she had received 900,000 francs ($180,000) for her house--three times its actual value. On Calment's 120th birthday, the lawyer joked, "We all make bad deals in life."  His comment pretty much sums up the moral of this story, but perhaps we need to take a closer look at why it was such a bad deal. It's the same reason so many of us make bad deals: we're suckered into looking only at the short-term consequences of the things we do. We convince ourselves we're thinking long-term, but we're wrong.  Maybe we turn our backs on long-time friends, hoping to move up into a more exclusive social group at school, but end up with NEITHER set of friends. Maybe we spend every available dollar on clothes and entertainment, hoping to establish a decent image, but eventually find ourselves with neither image nor cash. As we look back over our lives, many of the hopes and dreams we thought were long-term turn out to be quite short-lived.  Several of our decisions are much more short-sighted than we would like to admit. We certainly need to plan for the future and make wise decisions in that regard. Yet let's learn from this French lawyer that we won't always see our best intentions come to fruition. His $180,000 investment didn't pay off (for HIM) at all. Just think what else he could have done with the money.  There's probably not a day that goes by when you won't have an opportunity to make a decision that has eternal consequences. Any time you choose to talk to a loner, to volunteer for public service, to commit yourself to a worthwhile church project, or to make some similar decision, you never know what the results might be for someone else in the context of eternity. So as you make your long-range plans, never forget to make the most of today as well.  On your own ...  Read Luke 12:13-21. http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NLT&passage=L uke+12%3A13-21  Why do you think Jesus told this parable? The man's decision to build bigger barns seems practical, so why is he used as a negative example? What do you think Jesus means when he encourages us to have "a rich relationship with God"?  2. SURF REPORT  ~ ePrayer Prayer is our way of communicating with God. We share our needs and our thanks through prayer. We gain strength from it. And when we lift our hearts together in prayer, our strength multiplies. That's what this site is all about. http://eprayer.com  ~ Teenpoint.net An online Christian teen community http://www.teenpoint.net/   ~ United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps Pride. Service.

Lewis  We have all eternity to celebrate our victories, but only one short hour before sunset in which to win them. - Robert Moffat  In making our decisions, we must use the brains that God has given us.

      BIBLICAL BLOOPERS Part 2  What follows are New Testament bloopers from Sunday school students:  ~ When the three wise guys from the East Side arrived, they found Jesus- in the manager. Jesus was born because Mary had an emaculate contraption.  ~ St. John, the Blacksmith, dumped water on his head.  ~ Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others before- they do one to you. He also explained, "Man doth not live by sweat alone."  ~ It was a miracle when Jesus rose from the dead and managed to get the tombstone off the entrance.  ~ The people who followed the Lord were called the 12 decibels.  ~ A Christian should have only one wife. This is called monotony.  ~ The epistles were the wives of the apostles.  ~ One of the opossums was St. Matthew, who was by profession a taximan.  ~ When Mary heard that she was the Mother of Jesus, she sang the Magna Carta.  ~ St. Paul cavorted to Christianity. He preached holy acrimony, which is another name for marriage.  ===============================  Mikey's Thot for the Day: I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.  ===============================  PASS IT ON!

Then Joshua led the Hebrews in the Battle of Geritol.  ~ The greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son to stand still and he obeyed him  ~ David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in the biblical times.  ~ Solomon, one of David's sons, has 300 wives and 700 porcupines.  ===============================  Mikey's Thot for the Day: I went to a restaurant that serves "breakfast at any time."
