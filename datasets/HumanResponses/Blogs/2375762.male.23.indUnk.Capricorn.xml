       Why the Americans need Indians so desperately?  -By Prosenjit Datta -Source: Business World, January 5 2004, Page 68.  Americans do not need much help from other countries – they just cant do without the help from India. Why? Quotes from a young American with whom P. Datta was having a chat. Read on...  •	Indians are needed at the time of birth. America faces a terrible shortage of nurses. The USA needs almost 50,000 nurses in a hurry. Fewer and fewer people are joining nursing courses in the US. Why? It is a terrible job – low wages, bad working hours, not many prospects of going up. •	We need teachers. Indians produce hordes of grads and post-grads who have no jobs. They jump at the thought of becoming teachers in our public schools. Not too many people in the US want to become teachers in these schools, what with all the shootings and the bad behavior of our kids. So we feel that Indians should fill up the positions in at least the worst public schools in our country. •	There is research – genetics, software, telecom, pharma – where we Americans want to maintain our lead in the world. But we just don’t produce brilliant people. Your IITs churn out brains by the thousands, on whom we rely to do our research for us. •	We will shortly need your armed forces. Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that in spite of our technological superiority, we still end up losing some American lives. And, suppose we give out visas and green cards to people who want to join the American armed forces, I am sure we’ll get millions of Indians applying overnight. •	We need your people to man all those irate calls that we get from people who’ve bought American products. Why do you think so many call centre jobs are being shifted to India? The reason was that we are simply too sick of fielding all those calls from cranky customers.  P. Datta asks that young American, “So, what will the Americans do?”. The young man answers, “Oh, we will continue to do the really important thing – run the world.” This shows where the reputation of India and Indians really lies.

      Down with the docs who cant even read a chest x-ray. It is an established fact that the aorta, among others, is clearly visible in the X-ray near the chest bone. Well, if you have docs who say, "Gosh! You have some sort of liquid out there!", how do you expect to remain alive if your chest is filled with a liquid! Again, down with the docs who can differentiate the two diaphragms, and who say, "Your left diaphragm is abnormally different from your right diaphragm'. God help them all. Quack quack...oops, sorry...tsk tsk...!!!  -And so says the master.

       Case of the disappearing clothes   Today was pretty much the same, as in, go to the lectureroom, listen to the boring speech and get out with nothin gettin in as much. Well, the girls here are amazing! They just wait for the temperature to drop below a certain threshold, and LO!!!!!! their clothing starts disappearing. A girl who till yesterday was wearing thick pants and neck covering jackets, suddenly switches over to micro minis and low neckline tops! What do u call that??!!  Now to Melbourne. Well, Melbourne's a wonderful place! The city's awefully CLEAN. But the other day i was passing by the port area, and well, the city view from there was pretty much like what we might see of Mumbai city from one of our Mumbai shore lines. Except for the fact that Melbourne's clean and disciplined.   Getting back to the point...abt the Case of the disappearing neckline. Can anyone of you guess the reason? If you find any, mail em to me. Simple :) Hope to et a better sense!

       My uni...Day 2 - Post Easter   Second day of my uni after the easter break. How was the first day? Well, the day started with a test...which thankfully was not to be counted in any way, so we were relived. Well, the next thing that followed soon was an assignment, to be submitted in the 10th week of the uni. Now? Well, this is the 6th week. We have 3 more weeks. To those who are utterly clueless about words like uni, assignemtn and test being associated with me...I am doing my Masters in Telecomm Engg at Victoria University, Melbourne. Now you guys want to know more about Melbourne, right? The next blog, maybe tomorrow, will have some info on Melbourne.

       Test! Test!! Test!!!  Had a test today. Final test for a subject in my masters course. Wasnt so bad, but wasnt excellent too. Dunno why, but Mike had set a rather odd paper.   Sonia Gandhi...India's next PM?  Should Sonia be India's next PM? Have absolutely no idea. Personally, I am not in total favor of her decision. But the very contentious fact remains why should a person of foriegn origin be the head of a nation? There are reports, can call them rumors too, that she still holds her Italian citizenship. By law it is required that u surrender one citizenship after u take up another citizenship, and Italy doesnt figure in the list of countries with whom India supports dual nationality. Lets see what happens in the future. Lets see how the events unfold.   NEWS:Hooray for Bloggywood  Congratulations are in order for one of our users. Film deal for 'Baghdad blogger': "The Baghdad Blog, a book based on an online diary written by an Iraqi man about life during the conflict there, is to be made into a film." First a book, then a movie and it all started at Blogger. Nice!

       Greetings on a Monday morning.    Well not exactly a Monday morning for us in Australia. The day was pretty rough. The temperature's also steadily dipping, wont be much time until it gets freezing out here. Footy is also in full swing with St, Kilda leading the tally with 32 points and having won all the matches they've played. Richmond were the favs, God knows whats with them. Richmond fans were even caught cursing their players, this aint correct.  But all in all Australia's pretty interesting. The life here's of a pretty laid back kind. More in later posts.  Meanwhile, do check out some pics @ http://photos.yahoo.com/taskar_neil

       Germany exit after losing to Czechs   Germany slipped out of Euro 2004 after a 2-1 defeat by a second-string Czech Republic, who had already qualified, saw them miss out on the quarter-finals for the second successive European Championship.   The three times champions had to win to guarantee their progress having earlier drawn with the Netherlands and Latvia but the Dutch took the runners-up spot in Group D after a 3-0 win over Latvia and will play Sweden in the quarter-finals.   Despite a fierce second-half onslaught Germany could not subdue a Czech side showing nine changes from the team which secured their place in the last eight as group winners with a 3-2 victory over the Netherlands last weekend.   Germany did briefly lead through a stunning Michael Ballack goal in the 21st minute but the advantage last for only nine minutes as Marek Heinz equalised with an equally-superb strike.   With the Germans pushing for the winner, Czech substitute Milan Baros scored on the break 12 minutes from time to make it three wins out of three -- the only unblemished record.   It was a disappointing display by the 2002 World Cup runners-up, who failed to show the necessary urgency against a Czech team who were able to relax and enjoy the occasion.   Germany follow Italy and Spain as big name casualties of a tournament that has already lived up to its billing as one of the most open for years.  This Euro's gonna be a steal!

The Siberian-born teenager, who left her homeland for Florida as a seven-year-old, became the first Russian since Olga Morozova in 1974 to reach the final, where she will face holder Serena Williams who beat France's Amelie Mauresmo 6-7, 7-5, 6-4 in the second semi-final.   The 22-year-old Serena, who beat her sister Venus to win the last two finals dropped her first set of this year's tournament to Mauresmo but the 24-year-old fourth seed failed to hold her nerve.   Serena battled to win the second set, during which Mauresmo had treatment for a back injury, and sealed victory in the third when Mauresmo sailed a forehand long. -------------------------------------------  FORMULA ONE   FIA president Mosley to quit  Max Mosley stunned Formula One and the wider world of motorsport on Thursday with a surprise announcement that he will stand down as FIA president in October.
