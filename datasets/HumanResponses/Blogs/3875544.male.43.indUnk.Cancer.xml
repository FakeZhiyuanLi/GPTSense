I show you mine you show me yours???&nbsp; ha ha

      It is morning and I find I have the highest energy for blogging in the mornings than at any other time. Let's comment on some things.... Greenspan: what's a damn 1/4 gonna do? I am poor and owe money...I love inflation!! It's wonderful for property values... It makes the dollar strong abroad. And let it happen where it hurts most. Not in my pocket but the pockets of the rich. Yachts, Diamonds, Cartier, Gucci, and Rollex watches... But where does it happen most???? Health care... Gasoline, groceries, prescription drugs, ONLY good place where it's going the right direction for all good people,... Electronics and computer type goods, yeppers!! You know I have figured out why health care can go up so much!! IT is because it is a form of extortion. I mean who's gonna say "OH that's to much for a triple by pass! I just won't pay that" or "Cancer Smancer, I'm not paying that for chemo!!" No it's either you die or you pay Madame.... Now what's it gonna be.?... 3 months or 3 years? You decide. Now some where out in blogland for the many who read my blog I have a question.>>> Enlighten me. Where is the price pressure coming from in medicine??? I know 2 things than you better not start off with in your answer unless you're willing to 'splain why it's not so. 1. Electronic and hightech goods are going down in price. So all the scans should be getting cheaper...Yah yah..?? That goes for the majority of tech related issues including the costs of genetic engineering....after PCR prices had to go down from there!!! Why not??? Now they are saying lower doses of chemo maybe just as effective so why more cost?? And with all the studies being done and having been done instead of replicate many of them entirely for certain highly similar drugs as well as procedures don't they just cross reference older studies and do it cheaper? And What the hell ever happened good common sense? Why aren't we exploiting the placebo effect instead of using it as a simple benchmark to get above when testing pharmaceuticals. Tell everyone some cheap and (of course innocuous) substance it the breakthrough de la breakthroughs of some horrible cancer and let it do it's charm. Now why is that so bad? If our brains tell us that something is going to work it has been proven that it is far more likely to do so then let's try exploitation of the placebo effect based on the fact that if anything exceeds the placebo effect in efficacy then it passes the FDA Tell someone it is a wonder drug to one group tell the other nothing that your just trying out an experimental (but safe) new drug to see if it works and check the difference if the group told "IT'S A WONDER DRUG" does better than the other group the FDA should approve it. I mean who has a copyright on psychological manipulation?? And if it saves lives.... Why not? I think ethicists are a little unethical.&nbsp; OR&nbsp;maybe  greedy &nbsp;?&nbsp;

        As things heat up::: well I  thoughI  would use a battery D size (out of a working flash light) and use some telephone wire and make little copper electrodes out of some copper sheeting and then glue then to the poles and do the + - molecule pull through alumium oxide.&nbsp;&nbsp; ( now I haven't mentioned that all along I do have some good chromatography medium on glass that I had been trying out on the side.)&nbsp; Does some cool things in a fairly consistent organic solvent like methylene chloride&nbsp;&nbsp; ( which I was out of )&nbsp; DMSO is really fun but can be tricky and dangerous ......  and the substance I eventually was going to chromatograph could have held some hallucinogenic substances so I was not taking chances on that stuff passing through my skin in unknown quantities ... especially considering I have never done any hallucinogen in my life short of mild old THC in leaf...) Instie way... I also had some cool dyes of unknown concentration or affinity that I was going to play with and I thought these might give me some clues to the organics in this old extract I had done.&nbsp; I had done the extract from about 40.oo$ worth of salvia divinorum leaves... ( all gone now so don't ask)&nbsp; Believe me so much more comes out of an extract&nbsp; than the desired chemical... of this I am certain and of course this is well know or why would people be running chromatographs on solutions in the first place....... but I digress.&nbsp; I tried 3 differnent processes ( none really finished yet....I think)&nbsp; !.&nbsp; I tried the elecrodes at the bottom and top of a test tube filled with alumium oxide as medium and ran the extract with some luminol ( I need a black light) and some fuchine of some kind from merck dated about 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I would wait until the organic and water diluted dye enhanced liquid hit the bottom electrode to see what the full effect might be like.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think however it&nbsp; was intended to be done this way for more than 1 reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; One :: I think the copper electrodes in solution began to react slightly with the aluminum oxide releasing some gasses that left gas discontinuities in the coloration lines.&nbsp; Also I think that aluminum oxide at that mesh is best to run in capillary tube chromatography not electrophoresis...... a metal compound medium..... don't laugh too hard you will shit your pants...!!&nbsp; I think the best results are eventually going to come from the chromatographic latex polymer on glass absorptions.&nbsp; although Ithink to much of the dye is apparent and is over exposing and occluding much of the ideosyncratic lines of molecular ID particulars.&nbsp; I also used a fine mesh filter covered with 3A quality fine mesh beads to simply strain the extract to see if some of the organics are not more than proteinations globs denatured and hanging in solution and of no use.&nbsp; there is&nbsp; about a 6 to 8 ounces of this extract left in the solution as Ihave it diluted and there is still a noticible green brown deep coloration to it that hasn't settled out now, and Ihave had this stuff sitting aroung for nearly 3 months, so its not gonna settle out anymore.

          I have a lot to say today because I haven't posted in 2 days.&nbsp; Actually I posted again yesterday, but actually it was just a edit and amendment of a post from day 25, July.&nbsp;        &nbsp;     &nbsp;   I have been doing some chemistry experiments none of which are quite finished and in reality&nbsp; probably will not give me much information in the area I am looking but it was fun doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned a lot of practical stuff that sometimes you take for granted.&nbsp; Like the need for a little better than average dexteriy, plus some creativity when it comes to setting up the typo of experiment you are going after.&nbsp; My plans were multitasked actually.&nbsp; first I wanted to play a little with amylase and starch&nbsp; and this was in part due to a search for a good electrophoretic medium that I could make with stuff available.&nbsp; YES I actually had the amylase enzyme concentrate in a bottle .... may have been a littel old and could have broken down a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; dunno!&nbsp; All I found is&nbsp; that there appear to have been some changes made to the corn starch of today and that of when I was about 9 years old.&nbsp; Back then I remember mixing it with a little water and getting a metal bandaide box full of gelatinous thick opaque gunk.&nbsp; that I could play with if there was a small amount of water added.&nbsp; well this stuff so far has stayed white and only appears to have the&nbsp; colloidal property in water when it is not disturbed much and it doesn't or "has not yet" turned the grayesh opaque funky stuff of my 9 year old experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp; if you stir it up much it gets more watery again if you let it sit it gets nice and thick but vigourous agitation results in the dropping out of colloid.&nbsp; don't know it the starches are shorter today or longer or less hydrogentated.... there's a question for any of you chemical curious persons out there.&nbsp; A&nbsp; professional who is sure of the answer would be acceptable as well, in fact quite welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; more ot this continued as I tried to see if I could find a good substitute for maybe a gycerol or what not.&nbsp; But I guess I was to scatter brained and wanted to do to many things this not eliminating enough variables to do much good in my search but at least made for fun and some unpredictability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOOOO .... I then turned&nbsp; my&nbsp; attention to the use of the amylase to see if I could manipulate the molecular sizes of the starches by cutting some of them up.&nbsp; I had hypothesized that particle size had was greater than it had been and that maybe they just couldn't colloidalize.&nbsp; The amylase succeded in only getting the starch in water to take on the consistancy of milk for quite some time but then it returned to the gummy thick stuff than when stirred changed to the milky stuff only temporarily.&nbsp; I measured temperature change in all the mixes to see if the different amounts of amylase resulted in any temp change due to the enzymatic action but,... twas not to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I decided I't try to see if aluminum oxide mesh 80 to 100 could be made to stay in medium like liquid soap for long enough to be used as a polymixed medium that I was guessing&nbsp; could be used with a electric + and - polarity at two ends separating out my molecular mix.&nbsp; HOLD ON I AM GOING TO POST THIS FOR SAFTY SAKE CAUSE THIS IS GONNA GET LONG.     &nbsp;

      You know Barbara was an interesting woman from many aspects. Did she want all of those children? YOU know what I find strange is althought the kids know Barbara probably told me more about herself than anyone now alive,,.... none have mined my brain to know more about her real feelings of love hate life and everthing as it was as she saw it. Many think they know... and many maybe are afraid to know what she might have thougth at those moments of thoughtfulness. Another thing strange about barbara's children; &nbsp;None have ever matched her intellectual prowess, nor seem to have interest in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Y,et I had great interest in learning too..... both role models, as we may have been at some time, &nbsp;never birthed&nbsp;any educational drives like she and I shared.&nbsp; I loved that about her, that she understood me, and respected my intelligence. She actually understood what the movie "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf" was about and understood my facsination with it, yet she like any normal person certainly was bored by it after about 100 playings but she understood the intellectual subtleties&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;I&nbsp;did,&nbsp; and could quote lines. What did we talk about in the absence of the kids? Did any of the kids actually think a person like Chuck or Leighten Venn would have had an interest in Barbara (althought she had no college education) as an intellectual peer of curiosity. &nbsp;Poor and Lazy, often times as she was.&nbsp; She was smart.&nbsp; Did it ever occur to the children that without that apptitude I may have never been in their lives, If she had been a boring conversationalist with no ability to dicuss at least the news and politics of our time I doubt I could have lasted more than a few days and our lives would never have reached the point where we would recognize one another on the street today.........She was an intelligent woman .... do any of you ever plan to ( when you have the time and money) follow in the steps of your mother and unleash some intellecual curiosity about the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you all know that she&nbsp;faught with herself as to whether&nbsp;she would continue her&nbsp;career in school, or&nbsp;step&nbsp; forward and fulfill the duty she felt she had to her parents to give up her studies,&nbsp; get her parents out of the nursing home, and take on the more dull task of caring for them at home.&nbsp; Yes she took their money.&nbsp; but not for herself .... no her&nbsp;children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had she attained a bachelors degree with the demanding scholarly efforts required ( as she no doubt easily could have) She would have been far happier.&nbsp; But Barbara though superficially at times selfish.... In the larger role of sticking it out as a parent and keeper of her own aging parents ( 2 more children at that point who, by the way in their own ignorance and understandable senility of being in their late 80's, abandoned her to her only reliable son kevin.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin took the broken woman abandoned by me,&nbsp;&nbsp; emabarrased and taunted by her son Joey and wife over a petty phone bill even the week before her death.&nbsp; He cared for her while the remainder of the family bickered and endulged in their transient bounties of money.&nbsp; (Timmy, Stephen and Joey)&nbsp; (all more fit financially to care for her and blind to her impending death)&nbsp; Kevin Stayed in a broken marriage suffering the criticisms of the family who did not understand his dilemma, keeping the fantasy alive for his mother,&nbsp; all the while, cleaning up the carpets&nbsp;the&nbsp; filthy blankets and cigarette burns.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still remember the kindness in the questions as kevin explained to us on the 48 hrs leading up to her death......"Mom did you have any accidents while you stayed up at Timmy and Steve's?&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she went to the hospital he had her take a good bath so that she would not be embarrased and then called the drugged rabble in Pampa that " Mom may be dying.... come quick.......we don't know whats going on.... they want to ventilate her and they won't let us see her and the doctors and nurses are running around all over"&nbsp; Later Timmy would curse me and our greed and blindness to her plight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey of course suffered in a silence only he knows, as it began to separate him from his mom and then after her death severed all ties to the man that held his hand till his senior year in highschool.&nbsp; Barbara lasted to see her last two children finally delivered up from the criminal justice system.&nbsp; first Tim;.. then only weeks before her death Jennifer.&nbsp; She said her good byes to all six of her childred and suffered the obstinante indignity of the abscense of her own parents and brothers from her funeral.&nbsp; Her Dedication to her children and grandchildren was to her a calling like that of a preacher to the service of the lord.&nbsp; As her own Mother cursed her checkbook than was never needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbara in the final irony had taken 8 children to care for in &nbsp; giving up her studies,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she gave up the only thing she felt was worth giving enough strength to keep her living, &nbsp;had it not been&nbsp;not for the greed of those of us in Pampa she may never have felt after gving so much that she had finally become a burden to those she's cared so much for.&nbsp; And rather than take more she died.&nbsp; She gave her life&nbsp; allowing her children to carve out theirs.&nbsp; Kevin found his love.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each has matured and changed not always in ways she would have liked.&nbsp; myself withstanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; But she left over 20 new lives in addition to the 6 she personally gave birth to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Kevin crys to smell her smell again.&nbsp; All one can do is marvel at the intensity of experience and reality one life makes in this huge and eternally fascinating universe.&nbsp; One small poor Lady never laid golden eggs but made lives a plenty and the family reunions in 20 years will be the snapshot,&nbsp; a mosaic of lives all the from the original labor pains of just one Intense sparkling woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Obituary read she was survived by her husband Stephen O'Kelley and.......

      LIFE IS A MIRACLE.  YES SUCH AN UNDERSTATEMENT THAT IS .... WELL I CAN'T LOOK THAT FAR DOWN.   I DON'T MEAN JUST THE PART THAT IS BIOLOGICAL I MEAN ALL OF IT.  ITS EVENTS THEIR SYMBIOTICS, THEIR SYNTHETICS, EVERY SUBTLETY, NUANCE.  ESPECIALLY AS ONE MOVES ON TO THE LEVEL OF CLOSER INSPECTION ON FINDS THE AMAZING, ABSOLUTELY FANTASTICAL, FASCINATING, QUEER AND MYSTERIOUS AT JUST ABOUT ANY AND EVERY LEVEL, MACRO TO MICRO-SCOPIC.  I, HAVING 43 YEARS OF LIVING EXPERIENCE, AND 18 YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND MUCH MORE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE INFORMALLY IN THE FORM OF MONUMNETAL AMOUNTS OF READING, NOT TO MENTION (BUT I WILL) THE FACT THAT I HAVE CLASS JUMPED DOWN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO DO QUITE A RARE THING I WILL TELL ABOUT LATER,....I STILL KNOW ALL THE MORE AS THE MORE I KNOW GROWS, HOW VERY LITTLE I MUST KNOW, WHICH IN ITSELF PUTS ME ALL THE MORE AT AWE OF THE MAJESTY AND MAGNIFICENCE OF EXISTENCE.    I WOULDN'T BE ONE MUCH TO COMPLAIN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE MODERN CONVINIENCES THAT WE ALL ENJOY (CONSUMERISM NOT WITHSTANDING)... AND I AM SURE WE'VE ALL NOTICED HOW TECHNOLOGY GOES FROM LUXURY TO NECESSITY IN SHORTER AND SHORTER TIMESPANS....IT IS THIS SMALL BUT GROWING COMPLEX OF CLUES THAT LEADS ONE TO BELEIVE THAT WITH ALL WE AS MANKIND TECHNOLOGICALLY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF WE ARE ANY BETTER OFF WITH IT THAN WITH OUT IT.  HOW MANY OF US COULD SAY WE KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AS NORMAL BIOLOGICAL ANIMALS ARE?  WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO FINE TUNE OUR ENVIRONMENTS TO OUR LIKING AND COMFORT...WE'VE GOT PILLS FOR ALL SORTS OF AILMENTS,             AIRCONDITIONING, STORES THAT BRING EVERY CONCEIVABLE CHOICE OF FOODS TOGETHER FOR PURCHASE IN ONE AREA.  WE HAVE SOFT BEDS, RUGS FOR OUR UNDERFOOT AS WELL AS REDUCING ECHO, WE CAN SPEAK ACROSS THE GLOBE FOR PENNIES OR BY INTERNET FOR FREE.

      Moments ago a phone call came in and my mom answered and as per usuelle upon hearing unusual noises on the line and since after saying hello no one answered, she yelled to my end of the house do you have anything on in there there is something wrong with the phone.  Anytime anything funky happens with phone and she answers she always thinks its something to do with the zany computer world in here where I do what she dares not to consider (sarcasm) Well, she is 75 so much is forgiven.  But she asked me to pick up the phone and when I was a puzzled by the noises as she was plus then a female answered twice saying hello back at me.  I had I know to have been a rather quizical look on my face and when I started to tell her about what I heard and didn't get to finish.  She interrupted me with "Don't be arrogant" at which point I was even more confused adding a presumably funny look with " what do you mean arrogant" when upon hearing that much she walked off.  Now  1. I get a little tired of always having my computer system blamed for all the peculiarities that happen on the line in this modern age.  2.  I don't understand why I was accused of being arrogant.  3.  If so without hearing the rest of what I heard on the phone and a subsequent call that I answered that was even stranger ( I won't bore you with the details.... although come to think of it this entire entry could be somewhat boring to someone) She never wanted to know more about the second call or anything more..... I am I that rude?  perhaps I am.  But I do get tired of something my mother has done ever since I was old enough to notice... in fact I have had to ward off the same trait in myself and have since learned to reduce my doing it substantially.  But why hasn't she ??? I mean there was a time when she wasn't 75 in fact 20 years ago I was 23 and she was 55 and was doing it then nothing has changed.  Hasn't she ever run into the difficulties I have in jumping to conclusions or perhaps since she only is honest enough and open enough to be so bold with anyone but family,...perhaps not.  run ins with your kin folk are usually not embarrasing or emotionally quite as taxing as those with closer friends or potential mates, dates, employers,....no need to add to that list.. Well, my mom did have a time when she worked nigh on to about 45 or 50 years ago and she had only 1 child to raise namely me.   So perhaps these type events were never there to grip at the learning curve. and shorten it enough for memory to be of value.  should publish if I don't want this thing lost ....learning curve in action!!

      Also what is so silly about a god creating the earth as so many scientists and the public even think,&nbsp; when yet it is very very mainstream science to believe that there was a thing called a singularity so small that it is but a mathematical point of definition, hardly more.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet this thing so miniscule somehow held the contents of the entire universe and for no particular reason about 13.7 billion years ago it went BANG and now we are all here..... well what a pleasant coincidence..... Much more reasonable than "God created the heavens and the earth"&nbsp;&nbsp; NO it's not scientific to think something like&nbsp; a God did it.&nbsp; It is more reasonable to think that it just happened with out a reason at all.&nbsp; Well&nbsp; I do think some people, and yes even scientists, are beginnning to see the irony there.&nbsp; Much as they are beginning so see the amazing improbability of life as complex as our selves.&nbsp; I mean,&nbsp; how many people have really&nbsp;looked at the explanations of natural selections and the idea of the selfish gene and all of this "life just wants to be" stuff and all the theories to explain the mechanics of natural selection and&nbsp; said shit there is&nbsp;no way they have a hold on it.&nbsp; first of all and I am not&nbsp;going to go very much further than that..... why would life if it were going for survival value come up with something that is a mere millisecond in the history of life when single&nbsp;cell microbs have been in existence&nbsp;quite&nbsp;happily ever&nbsp;since life got going and if it weren't for them we couldn't even exist not just because they&nbsp;got oxygen levels headed upward but that if you were to wipe out all our friendly bacteria we would all just die.&nbsp; So who needed who first them or us?&nbsp;&nbsp; And if that were even a plausible question why tack on this neocortex that lets me be so smart as to allow me to ask these questions?&nbsp; Where is the survival value there?&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems like&nbsp; cancer would be a better explanation for the honing up on the complex organs and such like we have..Better than natural selection if it happens before reproductive age, and it would give an explanation for oncogenes.&nbsp; I think a guy wrote a book on that too but I imagine he was banned to the basement of some university.&nbsp; any way&nbsp; so much for that.&nbsp; I have more on the scintillating grandiosity of life and philosophy and so forth coming later........

      Has anyone read Bill Brysons A Short History of Everything.&nbsp; It is a good book.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it seems that lots of people are trying their hand at such efforts of similar genre.&nbsp; It would have to be guessed that it would happen if one were really aware of the world of science at all these days.&nbsp; The world is SO big and it is so facsinating and it is only made to seem all the more miraculous by what we discover about it and the journey that got us to this point.&nbsp; Of course Man it could be said may or may not have gained greater knowledge if his paradigms at any given time in scientific history had been different, and It is certainly questionable what more we could do now if the paradigms of the now were&nbsp; be different.&nbsp; Now that may not be a thing so far away.&nbsp; After all, as the public educates itself more and more in the sciences all on their own,&nbsp; there is a push to do so in less intrusive ways.&nbsp; This is due mainly to the discovery that isolation of our objects of study in many ways have been shown to tell us less than we thought than if we were to study them in relation to the environment in which they situate themselves.&nbsp; Also because we have learned that (and much to the thanks of Thomas Khun who's book The history of Scientific Revolutions had a start in our&nbsp; pricking up our ears) Scientist are not near as objective as they make them selves out to be.&nbsp; And scientists are being humbled before nature like no time before in history as well.&nbsp; Also we are coming to note that there are some big deficits in our knowledge about certain,...one would think to be extremely important....issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like why do we know so little about love?&nbsp; And why has no one tryed their had at finding more about it?&nbsp; And why do we know so little about sleep? 1/3rd of our lives is occupied by it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also why did anyone ever decide that subjects of study were intities seperate unto themselves and that one or the other didn't have much to do with another when common sense tells you this is simply nonsense yet our children still come home asking such questions ( you think school would answer this as a matter of course) why do we need to learn about history or math or.......?&nbsp; Also one hears preposterous things like..... thats is religion and this is scientific.&nbsp; Well if they don't match to some degree doesn't that put one in a bit of a quandary and wouldn't we put more effort finding out why there are so many religions (thousands if not more if you include individual denominations) and yet so few mainstream scientific positions.

      SONGS OF EXPERIENCE INTRODUCTION Hear the voice of the Bard,  Who present, past, and future, sees;  Whose ears have heard  The Holy Word  That walked among the ancient tree;   Calling the lapsed soul,  And weeping in the evening dew;  That might control  The starry pole,  And fallen, fallen light renew!   "O Earth, O Earth, return!  Arise from out the dewy grass!  Night is worn,  And the morn  Rises from the slumbrous mass.   "Turn away no more;  Why wilt thou turn away?  The starry floor,  The watery shore,  Are given thee till the break of day."     EARTH'S ANSWER Earth raised up her head  From the darkness dread and drear,  Her light fled,  Stony, dread,  And her locks covered with grey despair.   "Prisoned on watery shore,  Starry jealousy does keep my den  Cold and hoar;  Weeping o're,  I hear the father of the ancient men.   "Selfish father of men!  Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!  Can delight,  Chained in night,  The virgins of youth and morning bear?    "Does spring hide its joy,  When buds and blossoms grow?  Does the sower  Sow by night,  Or the plowman in darkness plough?   "Break this heavy chain,  That does freeze my bones around!  Selfish, vain,  Eternal bane,  That free love with bondage bound."     THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE "Love seeketh not itself to please,  Nor for itself hath any care,  But for another gives it ease,  And builds a heaven in hell's despair."   So sang a little clod of clay,  Trodden with the cattle's feet,  But a pebble of the brook  Warbled out these metres meet:   "Love seeketh only Self to please,  To bind another to its delight,  Joys in another's loss of ease,  And builds a hell in heaven's despite."     HOLY THURSDAY Is this a holy thing to see  In a rich and fruitful land, --  Babes reduced to misery,  Fed with cold and usurous hand?   Is that trembling cry a song?  Can it be a song of joy?  And so many children poor?  It is a land of poverty!   And their son does never shine,  And their fields are bleak and bare,  And their ways are filled with thorns:  It is eternal winter there.   For where'er the sun does shine,  And where'er the rain does fall,  Babes should never hunger there,  Nor poverty the mind appall.     THE LITTLE GIRL LOST In futurity  I prophetic see  That the earth from sleep  (Grave the sentence deep)   Shall arise, and seek  for her Maker meek;  And the desert wild  Become a garden mild.   In the southern clime,  Where the summer's prime  Never fades away,  Lovely Lyca lay.   Seven summers old  Lovely Lyca told.  She had wandered long,  Hearing wild birds' song.   "Sweet sleep, come to me  Underneath this tree;  Do father, mother, weep?  Where can Lyca sleep?   "Lost in desert wild  Is your little child.  How can Lyca sleep  If her mother weep?   "If her heart does ache,  Then let Lyca wake;  If my mother sleep,  Lyca shall not weep.   "Frowning, frowning night,  O'er this desert bright  Let thy moon arise,  While I close my eyes."   Sleeping Lyca lay  While the beasts of prey,  Come from caverns deep,  Viewed the maid asleep.   The kingly lion stood,  And the virgin viewed:  Then he gambolled round  O'er the hallowed ground.   Leopards, tigers, play  Round her as she lay;  While the lion old  Bowed his mane of gold,   And her breast did lick  And upon her neck,  From his eyes of flame,  Ruby tears there came;   While the lioness  Loosed her slender dress,  And naked they conveyed  To caves the sleeping maid.     THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND All the night in woe  Lyca's parents go  Over valleys deep,  While the deserts weep.   Tired and woe-begone,  Hoarse with making moan,  Arm in arm, seven days  They traced the desert ways.   Seven nights they sleep  Among shadows deep,  And dream they see their child  Starved in desert wild.   Pale through pathless ways  The fancied image strays,  Famished, weeping, weak,  With hollow piteous shriek.   Rising from unrest,  The trembling woman presse  With feet of weary woe;  She could no further go.   In his arms he bore  Her, armed with sorrow sore;  Till before their way  A couching lion lay.   Turning back was vain:  Soon his heavy mane  Bore them to the ground,  Then he stalked around,   Smelling to his prey;  But their fears allay  When he licks their hands,  And silent by them stands.   They look upon his eyes,  Filled with deep surprise;  And wondering behold  A spirit armed in gold.   On his head a crown,  On his shoulders down  Flowed his golden hair.  Gone was all their care.   "Follow me," he said;  "Weep not for the maid;  In my palace deep,  Lyca lies asleep."   Then they followed  Where the vision led,  And saw their sleeping child  Among tigers wild.   To this day they dwell  In a lonely dell,  Nor fear the wolvish howl  Nor the lion's growl.

      : "In 1959 C.P. Snow published a book titled The Two Cultures. On the one hand, there were the literary intellectuals; on the other, the scientists. He noted with incredulity that during the 1930s the literary intellectuals, while no one was looking, took to referring to themselves as 'the intellectuals,' as though there were no others. This new definition by the 'men of letters' excluded scientists such as the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the mathematician John von Neumann, the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener, and the physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Werner Heisenberg.  How did the literary intellectuals get away with it? First, people in the sciences did not make an effective case for the implications of their work. Second, while many eminent scientists, notably Arthur Eddington and James Jeans, also wrote books for a general audience, their works were ignored by the self-proclaimed intellectuals, and the value and importance of the ideas presented remained invisible as an intellectual activity, because science was not a subject for the reigning journals and magazines.  In a second edition of The Two Cultures, published in 1963, Snow added a new essay, 'The Two Cultures: A Second Look,' in which he optimistically suggested that a new culture, a 'third culture,' would emerge and close the communications gap between the literary intellectuals and the scientists. In Snow's third culture, the literary intellectuals would be on speaking terms with the scientists. Although "

      Did anyone of importance pay attention to this occurence?  Did not the empiricism and physicality of the work of these great scientist speak for itself, was this a strategic move by the quote "intellectuals"?     Is is not interesting that these scientists did not seem to care?   Did the public per se not notice the work of these scientist far more than the work of the "Intellectuals"

      : "The third culture consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.  In the past few years, the playing field of American intellectual life has shifted, and the traditional intellectual has become increasingly marginalized. A 1950s education in Freud, Marx, and modernism is not a sufficient qualification for a thinking person in the 1990s. Indeed, the traditional American intellectuals are, in a sense, increasingly reactionary, and quite often proudly (and perversely) ignorant of many of the truly significant intellectual accomplishments of our time. Their culture, which dismisses science, is often nonempirical. It uses its own jargon and washes its own laundry. It is chiefly characterized by comment on comments, the swelling spiral of commentary eventually reaching the point where the real world gets lost. In 1959 C.P. Snow published a book titled The Two Cultures. On the one hand, there were the literary intellectuals; on the other, the scientists.

      Whee... today according to a publication by Yellow Brix. Inc. a fascinating new joint venture has taken place between two companies who's main function and selling mechanism, is to create and market Specialty Resins.  Now, let it be know that Vitrotech and Iretex are joining forces to bring a product to market with much appeal...It is called Vitrolight.  It is a superior packaging product... very light and made predominately from Amorphous Aluminosilicate.. deposites of which (35 billion lbs)can be legally used for plastics paintings and other coatings and packaging products.  Now one should note that a light packaging product of strength and inexpensiveness, as well as being somewhat biodegradable would be a good thing to have in our world especially considering that our use of tree products need to plummet if possible.  Aluminum is cool.  It has a melting point of 1220 deg F and has a melting point of 4300 F.  If it were to be tinkered with to have properties similar to its column mate Boron could be hard.  Hardness would be a good quality in packaging if the lightness were maintained.  Boron Nitride is arguably the hardest substance known.  Boron alloys and combos are although more expensive much the rage.  and one could have Gemstones of outrageous quality with some of the newer technology introduced by the fella whose name is in MIT's Technology Mag.  and by super pressure Gas condensation is creating Diamonds and other gems Although a bit too perfect so that they occasionally much to the chagrin of DeBeers are discovered but not often enough and the mistique of the diamond made better by wonderous cerebrum of civilized hyper techno beautific man-god.  Aluminum extracted mainly by cryolite and electricty from Bauxite is also a very good conductor and the 3rd most abundant element on the face of the earth after silicon and oxygen,... the other stuff in that amorphous deposite of some 17 million tons.  Of course so far the greatest use for aluminum is transportation mechanics thus the packaging industry aforementioned.  Aluminum is amphoteric. ( that is it reacts with both acids and bases) the other better conductors of electricity although more expensive are copper and silver.  And considering the cost increases of copper one might consider more use of aluminum as electricity conductor.  it is a nifty element couched by neighbors of agility as or exceeding in some cases by magnitudes its own.  carbon silicon gallium zinc and germanum. but consider playing with dysprosium and iridum and applications could become all the more rewarding. hey one day someone may read my column just to link up industries of similar interests or synergetic combinitoralities of scale!  My Intuition could be worth the dollars!!! wow!!!       VitroTech and Iretex should look closely at what they have.  considering that amorphous aluminosilicates sound like they would have application in the semiconductor industry and that, they, morphed and, chemically extruded in various molecular formulas if doped with a few Kewl compounds or elements such as luminol or Rhodopsin B or firefly ass contents or radium..... then perhaps germanium arsenic gallium and other dipity etching and chip and glass blowing some quantum dot chromium glass.... well talk to Will McCarthy Author of "Hacking Matter"; he knows bundles about such practicalities yet this is an aside. Flourescense intermitentcy... ala Cadmium selenide... oh we could go on... if only all companies were driven by the field of Research.   Well any way.  These Two have wed and are now Husbanded by Jess Rae Booth  Chairman and CEO of VitroTech Corp. 714-708-4700  Good luck with your VitroLight.... but at least take a glance at Vitro.-.Light ... Flashing pottery!  Go for it. lucent Verizon Deal ... Man named Muongi Bawendi discoverer of the quantum dot in solution and in glass ( same thing really) and actually was dicovered the Renaisance.  these people know how to use your deposites too....

      I got up today and posted some stuff to my blog.  No sooner than I had pushed the post button and eaten a stray piece of birthday cake, and it came upon me.  That deeply sleepy....I know I am going to fall asleep feeling,...it took hold and soon I was asleep sitting here with my laptop in my...well...lap.  My parents appeared in the room as usual when I find myself zonked.  I told mom "I don't take my provigil on the weekends it is too expensive.  She of course said well you should and I did knowing that I would only be kept awake for a short period, only to succumb again shortly.  ( Provigil is a medication used by senile people to keep them more alert and for narcoleptics who fall asleep will driving bulldozers.  It is also known as Modafanil in Europe and Alertec in Canada. It is a schedule 4 controlled substance the lowest category I believe with a very small potential for abuse.  I, although I am a small sample group unto myself, feel no urge to take more than prescribed, nor do I feel high when taking it.  However, it does work to keep me from falling asleep during the daytime inappropriately, as long as I don't wait until I have already succumbed to the sleepiness one or more times before taking it,... as I did this morning.) I will look into getting the cheap alertec form from Canada for my next prescription depending on the final outcome of all the tests they keep running on me. I have already taken a "sleep deprivation EEG" ,and since it showed no tendency for sleep involved seizure activity (suspected for reasons I will explain on another day). They want to schedule me for a sleep study and sleep latency study sometime in the future.  So now it is 9:00 PM and I awoke an hour and a half ago and slept basically all day.  Well I had intended to expound upon some great theoretical thoughts that brew in my mind from time to time,  but unfortunately the only thing brewing today has been dreams that I can't remember well enough to recount.  So, this little story will have to suffice for this entry.

      nous avon news!  yep Oui! Si Aye.  In learning to do this bloggy thing I have twice evaporated two good posts... That now I only may refer to as practice.  Now,  let me tell you something... when I first saw the words I had written albeit, there were but few,  I was juiced!  ahww... So this is it! It is quite nutrifying to see your words written up in such a nice schemata of taste and color... a format  ummmm I like it.  I had before in one of the evaporated text referred to my aunt at having been so relieved that there had been no complications in the delivery of the baby.  She was relieved.  Now she must face the final undignified posture of telling her friends the vulgar truth that her great grandchild is a bastard!  Oh he has a father alright.  But the little baby was born out of wedlock.  I wondered at the news of the easy birth of the 7.1 lb baby girl she might secretly been hoping for a miscarriage or a "non-threatening to the mother", still birth.  This way she could just say her dear granddaughter had been in the hospital for the removal of a cosmetic surgery to take away socially inappropriate children.  "Oh the shame" OH .... Well mom gave her a Klonopin for her nerves and she went home to relax.        I  think cynicism is a good glass to look through at times of such sardonic irony...( oh and I welcome any correction in my use of words )  Life is more interesting with out the glasses of all roses and light.   It is in the Enquirer the Sun, The evening news, CNN.  Yes we love it our newly attached neofrontal cortex allows us such playful reactions to those thrills nabbed from our reptilian brains responding vicariously to the wretched vile glimpses of "Supermodel, runs down ex in Mercedes in jealous rage"   ( Sex Wealth Violence fame )...Our funky new brains revel in the downcasting of the beautiful lives of our fellows who have had it better and can murder in such emotionally bombastic ways we can only dream about.  So in the new post will scribe through the glasses of all roses and light......

      Es interesante que tengo dos blogues.  pero hay una problemita.  me gustaria poner los entrados y posts tambien las fotos de los dos blogues en cada uno del otro.  tengo fotos en el blog livejournal que megustaria simplemente mover al este pero hay que pasar por picasa "hello" y por cualquier razon que no puedo comprender no me deja entrar porque dice que mi e-mail esta registrada por otra cuenta. La cosa es que no se que cuenta y aunque ha tratado que constarlo por varios modos no se funciona; no sirve! pues asi es la mierda hijo fue canto! chingado la maqueda! ave maria pues chino!

      My previous post evaporated or so it seems. I guess it is dead.  I must do my duty and take my friend back to the nursing home since he was here for my birthday party, and although we are celebrating my birthday the irony hasn't been lost.  The day before my birthday my second cousin gave birth to my third cousin and made it's great grandmother feel much better about it all.

        Well, today is "THE" day DAY. Finally after waiting what seems an eternity and a economically painful,... unanticipated cost of expectation. [(Oxymoron) unexpected expectation...Hmmmm?] What I mean to say is that, I have waited a long time to get started on my sales season. Showme books boxes are stacked in my office, and today I will begin calling for appointments in earnest and begin a full force effort to acquire buisness and sales. This week school starts in Arkansas (the 19th) and it appears school has already started in Oklahoma. I luckily, have been given a marginably developed territory with approx. 80 customers that have already bought last year and, Showme is now offering cataloging and barcoding on shipped books. If you don't know let me repeat again....... I am and independent contract salesman for Showme Books Inc. I sell books to all ( k- 12 ) School libraries as well as some local public libraries at great discounts. Done in someways on what I call a sort of walmart model in the sense of that it is able to obtain quality, known publisher, clean, library grade, sought after books at 50 to 70 % discounts off original supplier prices. Really, these discounts are not a trumped up number, where the discount is off the highest possible price ever seen in print. Now, these prices have to be seen to be believed, and when I can find a librarian with the authority, money and need for the offerings we have, a sale inevitably happens. Occasionally I don't have enough variation for them to look at because of my carrying capacity. This soon will change. Because of the enlargement of my territory and the value in having this quantity of variation to look at I am going to start renting some of their walk- in trailers, that I will pull with a truck my father is planning ( bless his heart) on financing for me. So I will be set for making larger amounts of money than I have made in my life maybe not the first year here.....(estimates are 30-36K for the year) but by the second or third year I expect to grow my business to the range of (approx. 55k-65k ).           Like I said to day is the day..... I am going to shower and shave and dress, quickly and will be set to start my preliminary calling and appointment setting by 8:50 AM .          My contact address is 902 Aspen Ave. Van Buren, AR 72956 (Stephen O'Kelley) I can be reached at 479-474-6645 and 479-883-8743 (cell).      Great things will happen from here!! In all, for one thing I hope to be able to begin to pay back my parents for many incurred debts that are now approaching 24,000$ quickly.... Long story and that figure is really a low figure... It is just the amount they are going to require me to repay. Over the past 15 years hither and thither...maybe 30,000.00$ could be tacked on to that. (God bless them) Instie way on to my task. It is 8:20 AM......HERE GOES....................>>>>>>>>>>           COMING SOON PICTURES OF SOME OF MY PRODUCTS AND SAMPLE PRICES      SCHOOL SCHOOL SCHOOL SCHOOL SCHOOL BOOKS BOOKS BOOKS BOOKS           LOW PRICES

       j y yf I am sore afraid to change another thing  yet I just did! Notice the transformation from skinny little letters to italic to bold to large. At first It wouldn't hold on me now it has.........IInteresting I haven't mentioned a new thing in my life... I shouldn't say a new thing yet a person.. a special person. who no doubt if they have interest will read this blog entry. As my Entries may all change to this new format.....              Dear Toni,              Here is what I am thinking today. Tonight we are going to a banquette of sorts and we have free passes from you. I greatly appreciate all of this entry into your social scene. YOU definitely see me as someone you can present to the public with no embarrasment and in fact with pride. Inside myself I feel very inclosed. I am so glad I can go somewhere with a person on my arm... mix and mingle and delight. I am sure this entry seems incredibly juvenile compared to all my others. In that this one shows vulnerability and appreciation and emotion in flux. Toni You are an interesting person who thank god brought you my way. If I can I would love to restore you to a wholeness after this horrific divorce...... If it is within my power to do such a thing. You offer me entry into social avenues....This is a handsome gift that you may not be aware of . It's value is greater than you might imagine. It is hard for me to put into words but,.. it is meaningful and you can read about it and I may mention it in some way tonight.... but I will not say it like I am saying it in words now. God Bless you..... The hermit is emerging from the cave. Life is a miracle. It's complexity is what makes us innocent.. We know not what we do... we allow our emotions often to dominate, and reason takes a backseat. I want to pass on to you in exchange for this gift you have given me, a new vision of life... where your actions and mine do not in the grand scale matter.... KUBILIUS: " Free will is an illusion for it is synonymous with incomplete perception." Thus the past is but a flutter of smoke and the future is a pleasant curiosity and our interior can prosper and thrive in the clarity of observation without judgement,... allowing each moment to be a now all it's own. Soon the mind works with few words, for Much is Simple and Real and beautiful in it's own right. The unmanifested is the form that forms of nothing but the omnicreative interreciprocitous creative natural essence of existence. All from nothing by division.... the devil and the god blessing in all the curious and unimaginably fascinating disguises that god is ... us ... all one big circle without any scarcity. Scarcity is the ego of the separate bodies playing games with the world. See themselves as separate from all creation even more separate that ones fellow man........In this mistake much is stolen from the everlasting fountain as if it mattered that anyone took it had it or believed they could have more or less or what ever we believe about property... another illusion....owning earth.... why not own sky? and parcels of sea? When one owns a parcel of land what about the other side of the land corresponding on the other side of the earth diametrically opposite and physically connected. Do you not own both sides? And of the air that drifts through it? The creatures that inhabit it? the molten rock below the chuck of solid iron or nickel, or what ever they think is in there right now...? What it I had the technology to get it would it be         my chunk of iron or nickel? What if I wanted to move my land to a nother piece of land I own. Would I then still own the vast depths of the space from which it came?               well enough of that, later Steve.......

      May be of some interest to Olympian followers out there and I hope a link to such a popular site might bring a little more traffic to mine. If I am not mistaken this guy is in the Olympics , and is worried that he has heard a rumor suggesting that blogging about the Olympics by Olympians may be banned but JEZZ ... I think the rumor for ONE. May have no merit or truth or valid source. And...TWO. If it did it would be idiotic because blogging is one of the coolest advertising free market sources out there. So much that some become profitable and syndicated. Some however believe in the "information just wants to be free" Ideation YET ??? Is this true>>>> Can you really find anything on the net. This Olympian has struck me with an idea of sorts.....What if one were to test the system and see if information is really free.....What if I could tell some secrets concerning national security or perhaps some technics on invention of an atomic bomb would it stay posted or get itself removed? Or if I were to publish some very creative and original methods of suicide or methods of doing some particular drugs and also say that I support the experimentation with some of my methods by any self regulating, of legal age, and appropriate intelligence,....adult .... or suppose I promote the use of building personality strength in childred ages 9 through 12 or at least just before puberty as a mental expansionary security zone builder of the mind administration of low doses of LSD under supervision and proper comfortable non-threatening settings. If bad results are at first displayed then one should continue use under different settings and doses with therpeutics until relaxed open ego releasing results occur. Suppose I promoted this civil disobedient use as a prophylactic against alcoholism and drug abuse dangers as well as an proper mental stabilization, a sort of readying of mind to face adolescence with greater confidence and personal security. You must say of the few experiments the government has ever carried out and allowed for public scrutiny, most showed extraordinary value in elimination of alcoholism with a success rate much higher and with much less work intensive therapy than AA. There are others but I would stray from my question and suggest just how damaging or objectionable such propositions could be in light of the abnormal treatment of these curiously valuable drugs by the government. Why .... If they chose to do such a thing ... Would there be rational to suppressing of such knowledge and why hide it and ban it from almost all research except research specifically aimed at damaging the reputation of the drug. What do we find is so desperately dangerous about these Category 1. (ONE. Dangerous and having no medical value of any sort) would tend to make Adam and Eve both a little curious about biting that apple .....no?? Curiously some of the more exotic, and least tried, and woefully unexplored, and certainly, astonishingly powerful, psychoactive substances investigated by the infamous and harassed, Alexander Shulgin were indeed given the names Adam and Eve for reasons I'm sure only the sythesizers know for sure. I do believe that Adam may have been the first name hoped to be given to MDMA or Ecstacy. Ecstacy  by it's very name killed the birth of Adam in an area of therapeutics ( psychiatry ). This drug  had such potential. Why does the FDA only want us to have mediocre drugs for any kind of therapy. If it really betters our lives transforms our outlook on life ........KILL IT!!! Then it travels into the black market to be abused adulterated and released into uncontrolled insane and often dangerous senarios and to youth with poor judgement. Wasn't there a better way to have controlled this drug through special laws protecting the use of certain substances not by prescription but by use in the doctors office only. Study it's ins and outs its dangers its all that stuff the trials test for. Make it a schedule 2 with special dispensing restrictions and only available to the phychiatric arm of medicine. well enough of that meandering tirade.... Dissipating in an (even I am not sure) direction and point "directional point" (that would be a vector) wouldn't it? Well then aimless but etymologically vectorial nonetheless... OH the specter of the Vector PRO pa Gan DAR Re,  propaga,   Dar Dare,  Fed dar  fe dar al...... Specious speculation on linguistic origins .... verbal  memes viral memes like wise. MEE thinkes my Government be in bed with the EGO our Economy ECOS of HOUSE hold and NOMOS ... The numerical, the linear, and the time line bind, that exist as the status quo only as EGO in each and every individual,.... As proposed historically by ADAM Smiths INvisible Hand of the capitalism.  This dogma will not be encroached upon.  It is law unwritten be legislation easily found except in the illegalization of LSD and various other phenylethelamines and tryptamines that remain locked away in the vault to guard against any change to the positive in the conciousness of humans outside the thought constructs of the VanGuard the Status Quo.  No one must attack the validity of the ego or capitalism dies and so does the wealth machines  run upon the unconscious ego coding of consumerism.

      Well,  it has now come to my attention that it may cost me 888.00 to get all the bells and whistles that will go with getting a new crown for a tooth that has fallen out and needs replacing.   How does one live long enough to distill properly and with the least mental breakdown possible to match the two ( long life and good memory there of) to have some real wisdom?  Are we more reluctant to pass it along as we get older?  I know that I certainly don't have the drive I once did for pushing out ideas in a euphoria of intellectual selfcontentedness and bliss that I once did.   Hmmmmm.... could that be a clue that what I have to say is not so earthshaking as I had once thought?  I have been delaying the copying off of about 4 to 5 hand written pages of what I think,  when reread,  are absolutely still true today and are well written adulation of the fantastical miracle of existence,.....life, just being.   wonderful and exhilerating.  But I just can't get up the Umph.. to do it all in one whack.  I always wait until I am to tired like now.    Well I have a plan.   Tomorrow when I am at the top of my energy game in the morning, and on a morning where I have to accomplish a lot of other things afterwords, and would feel real good about having written it up,  I will do it and feel better about it and also feel like I am on the way to getting more done for the rest of the day since I have work I need to accomplish anyway.... Sound like a good plan?    yeah me too! well see you on the morrow and will be checking to see if any of you are as inspired as Iupon reading it.....  YA YA ...

      Another day of hypersomnalesence.   Stupor.  Uselessness ...plus.   I hate this feeling of powerlessness and ineffectiveness.  It makes me ill.   Well,  I know I am ill.   I am so sloppy when I am sleepy.  I tried to pick the space bar off they typewriter of my computer.  I woke up more when It hurt my finger on the plastic.  Luckily I didn't succeed.    I did get up some and made an effort to awaken myself more but I couldnn't stay awake but for a short time until I'd be overcome by sleepiness again.  At least tomorrow I know I can start work and I will have my medication.

      Depression?... Yeah feel it. Yuck, I fell asleep today. I couldn't wake up more. I couldn't really do anything to make it stop. Even getting up and walking around the room... The whole house. I just stumbled around and bumped into walls in a kind of stupor I couldn't come out of it. It depresses me after any of these incidents happen. I am not sure why I feel so depressed except that I guess it makes me feel out of control. As I may have mentioned in neurological perturbations and such in another post, I, when I don't take my provigil, often times fall asleep. Fall asleep rather quickly without much warning or ability to resist. I have gotten to where now I can catch my self feeling a little like I'm getting sleepy. But it is different from just feeling drowsy and yawning and such. And it is something that you also can not shake by just getting up and staying up and moving around. Initially the sensation is like just a kind of slightly less awareness, and thickening, like I am weaker, yet it's something I have had to teach myself to begin to notice. It is abnormal and I will be having a sleep study and sleep latency test on the 1st and 2nd of Sept. I hope they find the cause because even half a provigil is not enough to stop the sleep onslaught.

         what if the link you need to click on below were predicting a reality?? Perhaps in a way it is already done. Can we trust one another here at BLOGSPOT? since we already share so much and what we do mention about ourselves on other blogs and as other people comment about us on other REAL URL's we do become a bit more known and a bit more noticeable we become,... Shall we say if not particularly well semantically linked.....iterated a bit more and each sub -iteration and transactional iteration makes us more Knowable if only because of our ever burgeoning ubiquity. I pop up on Google in places I don't remember being before and I am listed in a "people with interests in:......along with about 15 other people with pictures that are interested in the same thing. My picture is missing... How did that happen? Hell, how did I even get on this, quite complementary, little listette? I am getting more popular without people have had to have read my writings or even link to my pages simply because what I have linked to my page has been linked back to me as me....Actually I like it. The Dumb IRS thinks I owe them 63,000 dollars in taxes for 2003 and I never made that much money that year... That's like 200% taxation rate. They theorize I did it all in sneaky stock trades....on which I actually lost money. But after losing the money I have lost and analyzing the trends I followed and the stocks I selected. I found out how to make money. Failure was a friend this time. I mean,.. I discovered that had I left alone almost any ( 9 our of 10 ) stocks I chose at any time in any combination and simply left them there, randomly chosen (which it appears I was a fantastic picker!!) I would have made about 500% gains!!

      Talked to my friend, My stepson, and all around cool guy, father of Seven kids........... Sometimes more. Otherwise known as the guy who holds the family together. Definitely someone I should have listened to few years back. But enough of that,,,,,,, He has helped me place this little video of myself in here, and we are helping one another on a site concerning his mother. She was a mother of 6, he one of them,. One of fraternal twins. The site he is making has portions with each his own section about their memories about Mom, Barbara,.... Who died on Dec. 5th 1997. My role in all of this... Well you will find out if you follow the blog over time. My story, and so will their's, be told over time. And some day, if we keep adding material and going through it all; And there is a lot; Letters, Cards, Video tapes ( must be 40 video tapes in total including the ones I am no longer hoarding to myself).... We intend to make, with a page he has already started in memory of his mother, a bigger more enhanced page with a place for every family member to add their thoughts. It is a long and, and very odd story about the the intersection of our lives. But it happened, and almost none of us regret any of it. I know I don't and neither does Kevin.
