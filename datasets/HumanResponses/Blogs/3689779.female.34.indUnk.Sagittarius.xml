      Thousands of readers across Mississippi are expected to read The Girl in Hyacinth Blue as part of the One State, One Book program, sponsored by the Mississippi Library Commission Center for the Book. The program was designed to encourage Mississippians to read and discuss the same book during 2004.    "Girl in Hyacinth Blue," the story of a fictitious painting by the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, was chosen as a tie-in with The Glory of Baroque Dresden international exhibition in Jackson through Sept. 6.   The exhibit consists of more than 400 works from the State Art Collections in Dresden, Germany, and reflects Baroque art including paintings by Rembrandt van Rijn, Vermeer and Peter Paul Rubens.   "Girl in Hyacinth Blue" begins in modern times and traces the painting's ownership back to its creation in the 1600s.

      Greenwood mayor Harry L. Smith recently presented Greenwood native and blues guitar legend Hubert Sumlin the city's first Heart of the Blues Award.  The presentation took place June 10, the first day of the 21st annual Chicago Blues Festival, and honored Sumlin for his lifetime contributions to the blues.  Sumlin, best known for his tenure playing guitar for Howlin' Wolf, has also shared the stage with such artists as Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones and Muddy Waters.  He was even listed at No. 65 in Rolling Stone's Sept. 18, 2003, special edition, "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time," which claimed his work on Wolf's classics "inspired Keith Richards and an entire generation of British bluesman."  Wesley Smith, son of Mayor Smith and membership chairman for The Blues Foundation in Memphis, came up with the idea of honoring Sumlin.  "It's overdue," Wesley Smith said. "A lot of these guys are recognized around the world, so it's important for their hometowns to embrace them."  At Smith's suggestion, and with the help of his father, the Greenwood City Council passed a resolution on June 1 that honored Sumlin with the Heart of the Blues Award.  "I think anytime we have a recognized blues star who has roots here, it's a good idea for us to honor them," Mayor Smith said.  Wesley Smith, who was already scheduled to be in Chicago for the festival, planned the presentation after learning his father also would be in Chicago that weekend for a conference.  "When that opportunity came, I suggested that it might be a good idea for the mayor of Greenwood to present Hubert with this honor," Wesley Smith said. "Hubert belongs to us. He's one of our guys."  Wesley Smith said Sumlin "smiled ear to ear" when he realized he was being recognized by the city of Greenwood.  "He seemed really touched," Wesley Smith added.  Mayor Smith said Sumlin almost got teary-eyed during the presentation.  "He was just totally surprised," Mayor Smith said.   Sumlin was born in Greenwood in 1931, and was raised in Arkansas. He moved to Chicago during his childhood, but his love of the blues he heard down South sparked a creative fire that would ultimately turn him into one of the most influential blues guitarists of all time.  "He has really signature licks that he created," Wesley Smith, also a musician, said. "His playing is really distinctive and creative. You can see how he's influenced today's music.  "The translation of that is that you can hear how many of today's musicians have stolen Hubert's licks and claimed them as their own."  Although Sumlin never reached the level of commercial fame so often associated with success in the music business, the praise he has received from other musicians is evidence of his influence.  Guitar virtuoso Jimi Hendrix was once quoted as calling Sumlin his "favorite guitarist."  Wesley Smith said his first meeting with Sumlin in 2002 revealed an artist proud of his heritage and "wistful about his hometown."  "In music circles, Hubert's a legend," Wesley Smith said. "I think it meant a lot to him to be honored by the place where he was born."

      Jacqueline Gooch, a 12-year old Delta resident with a Janis-Joplin voice, is positioned to sign a record contract later this summer. She has received extensive attention, playing in festivals across the Delta and in several other states. She began playing the guitar at age 7 and credits lessons at the Delta Blues Museum as the beginning of her interest in the blues.   State and local officials are using education programs like the one Gooch attended to extend the state's musical tradition, and they are encouraging all residents to see the benefit of working together to reclaim the state's blues heritage.   "Memphis and Chicago regularly advertise that they are the birthplace of the blues. It is important for Mississippi to reclaim that status," said Luther Brown, director of the Delta Center for Culture and Learning at Delta State University and member of the state Blues Commission.   The challenge is that unlike those major cities, Mississippi is a vast area filled with blues history and music in nearly every nook and cranny.   However, many of those communities have been competing against one another instead of working as a whole, said Brett Bonner, editor of Living Blues, an Oxford-based publication that has covered the national blues scene for 35 years.   The buzz of activity surrounding the blues was the focus of a recent Living Blues issues that revolved around blues sites in Mississippi.   The Blues Highway organization, an ad hoc group of people interested in state blues heritage, meet six times a year to discuss the state of the blues.   The group grew out of research the state conducted four years ago and includes business owners, organizations and professors.    What's being done?    The organization joins a number of state and local groups that recognize the need for local involvement as they attempt to attract more tourists.   In January, Gov. Haley Barbour approved a state Blues Commission to develop a marketing plan for blues sites across the state.   The commission, made up of blues experts and business owners, has not officially met but has talked of improving infrastructure and markers for historic sites as some possible goals.   The goal of all of these movements is to ensure that the blues culture and music is carried on, and education programs, such as the one run by the Howlin' Wolf Blues Society in West Point, play a major role.   Charles Regan Wilson, director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, said the education programs offer children the unique opportunity of experience and art firsthand.   "We have programs in the schools and mentoring programs at community centers in the state that are having older performers teach the blues to younger ones, passing on the tradition, just as we have school programs that teach students to approach Faulkner and Welty and help them understand that being from Mississippi means we have a great cultural tradition that needs to be extended," he said.   The hope is that, by increasing education about the blues and the evolution of blues music, Mississippi children will carry on the keep the music alive.   About a dozen of the 35 children involved in the Delta Blues Museum education program recently traveled to Mount Vernon, Ill., to play in the Blues and Barbecue Festival, said Shelley Ritter, museum director.   Past students have visited the White House to perform, and local blues musicians drop in frequently to give expert tips.   "A lot of the local musicians even drop in to cherry pick, trying to recruit some of the better musicians," she said. "So, it is not unusual for the students to sit in on performances at Sarah's Kitchen and Ground Zero."

      All tires are different but they are rated on a common scale, so you can do some comparison shopping. Aside from size, one of the most essential codings is the speed rating, contained in the basic description code of the tire. For example, in P275/45R18 95V, the last letter is the speed rating, "V," which means the tire is good for up to 149 mph. You'll also notice a treadwear rating--a long-life, all-season tire would have a treadwear rating of 450 and 170 would be at the low end would only last about a year.

      Renovations have begun on the Westbrook House in  urlLink Mynelle Gardens  with hopes of making the Jackson park a larger tourist attraction.  The city will spend $311,000 to improve the interior of the historic house located at 4736 Clinton Blvd. Eventually, supporters hope wedding receptions, meetings and horticulture shows could be held inside the house.  Built in 1921, the Westbrook House has been closed to the public for more than a decade. The gardens are named after Mynelle Westbrook Haywood, who was an expert in flower arranging and gardening and lived in the home.  The city bought the house for $150,000 in 1973. Mynelle sold the property to preserve the gardens and house. The property was last occupied in the 1960s. About 6,000 people visit the park each year but have not been able to tour the house.  The house was designed by Noah Webster Overstreet and is considered a landmark. It was listed as one of the state's most endangered historic sites by the Mississippi Heritage Trust in 2000. The improvements will make the building eligible for listing on the National Registry of Historic Places, a designation which opens the door to federal grant monies.  The Mynelle Gardens Botanical Society begins a campaign this summer to raise $300,000 to complete renovations of the house. Tax-deductible gifts may be sent to P.O. Box 12308, Jackson, MS 39236.

      A gorilla sex video is getting regular play at the New Orleans Zoo. Casey, 21, came to New Orleans two years ago on permanent loan from the  Como Zoo  in St. Paul, Minn. The hope was that he might impregnate one or all of the  Audobon Zoo's  three female land gorillas. But he's not cooperating.  The zoo curator, Dan Maloney, said how animals choose each other is still poorly understood but they are hoping Casey gets the hang of it. He sees part of the problem as Casey coming from an all-bachelor group.  To give him some sex education, Maloney got a tape of copulating gorillas from a camera used to monitor another zoo's gorilla area. It's played in the indoor cage where Casey spends his nights. He's watching it but has not seemed very interested yet.  Chinese veterinarians used a similar strategy to teach a panda born in captivity in the United States what she might expect from suitors. The Beijing Post reported recently that Hua Mei, whose name means "China-America," is pregnant by natural means and is due in September.

       urlLink The Mississippi Girlchoir , composed of 27 young women, are Hawaii-bound for the Pacific Rim Children's Chorus Festival in Oahu. And they're learning songs in Hawaiian, Korean, Taiwanese, Samoan, Japanese, Filipino, Tearawan (New Zealand) and Tahitian for the trip.  The choir auditioned and was accepted for the July 6-14 festival. There, three mornings on the village grounds of the Polynesian Cultural Center will introduce the young singers to ethnic dances, Polynesian musical and dance instruments, the language and chants. They will sing in two major mass choir concerts in Honolulu, and also perform their own concert repertoire. They'll rehearse under the director of Indianapolis Children's Choir conductor Henry Leck, a prolific choral music composer/arranger.  Mississippi Girlchoir is an audition-only choir. Try-outs for the 2004-2005 season will be held through the end of September for the beginner and middle choirs. The older choir will probably be filled mid-July. Tuition costs are: $200 a semester ($400 a year) for the Bel Canto; $300 a year for Jibilate and $250 a year for Apprentice, with a $50 registration fee for each. To make an appointment for an audition or more information, call 601-362-9337 or 601-981-9863.

      National recognition recently bestowed on Jackson cost taxpayers thousands of dollars. But Mayor Johnson, however, says the price is well worth it.  In April, Jackson was named one of the most livable U.S. cities by the Washington D.C.-based  urlLink Partners for Livable Communities  and paid $10,000 to be included on the organization's Web site.  Awards that require such payments have caused a stir in some newspapers around the country. Critics say payments attached to the awards diminish the significance. City leaders defend the awards as worth their weight in publicity.  Jackson's payment was a requirement to be listed on the Partners for Livable Communities' Web site. Projects planned throughout town and special events are outlined on the site until a new crop of livable cities is named in four years.  Winning cities were listed in USA Today and awards were given at the National Press Club in Washington, he said. The fee was not a condition of receiving the award, Robert H. McNulty, president and CEO of Partners for Livable Communities, said in a statement on the Web site. The money funds the maintenance of the Web page, and it was the first time the organization had a fee.

      Keith Barton, a magician in Hueytown, Ala. with Mississippi ties, received national attention after Matilda, a 14-year-old chicken featured in his magic act, was officially named the "World's Oldest Living Chicken" by Guinness World Records.  Barton was born at Keesler Air Force Base, grew up in Gulfport and graduated from Harrison Central. His father, James Barton of Orange Grove, still lives in South Mississippi.  During the "Mort the Mystifying" magic show, Matilda's role is to appear in a pan that contained only an egg yolk and some hot sauce moments earlier. Barton's wife, Donna, is also in the act as the magician's assistant.  Matilda has practically doubled the lifespan of a normal chicken, which is 7 or 8 years. Matilda has never laid eggs and is very pampered, and Donna Barton said she believes both contribute to Matilda's long life.  The Bartons began performing their magic show in 1989 for children at libraries and churches. In July 1991, Matilda made her magic show debut.  Barton is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians, International Brotherhood Of Magicians and Ring 35 (Judge Arnold Drennen Ring) of Birmingham. He has extensive training in magic, including completion of the home-study course offered by Chavez College Of Magic in Los Angeles. He also spent a year mastering the Chinese Linking Rings, which are one of his signature routines.

      The last will of Jefferson Davis has found a resting place after years of questions about the appropriate place for it. The  urlLink state Department of Archives and History  in Jackson will be the home of the three-page handwritten will that has been in the possession of the Harrison County Chancery Court for more than 100 years.   urlLink Beauvoir , the Biloxi beachfront home and library of the only president of the Confederacy, has wanted the document for a display for several years. Beauvoir may still get the chance to display the will temporarily. The department's recommendation is to loan the document to Beauvoir for a short period of time in the summer or fall.  A legal provision allows the state to loan documents to Beauvoir. But the board of trustees for the department has ultimate say on whether the will can be loaned.

      Gulfport and South Mississippi have reeled in some impressive publicity this week, thanks to Sports Illustrated, which hits newsstands today. The magazine highlights Mississippi in a six-page feature as the 49th state to be profiled in its 50th anniversary state-by-state coverage series.  As part of the profile, the Mississippi Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo in Gulfport is featured on in-state covers as a sporting event unique to the state. Also, Mississippi native and Pulitzer Prize-winner Richard Ford is a guest essayist.  In addition, there is the popular poll measuring the state's favorite teams, from college and the NFL to the NBA and NHL. Former Ole Miss football coach and current Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville is listed as "the enemy of the state" while LSU is the state's most hated opponent.  The profile contains tons of facts, figures and photographs highlighting the most memorable moments and personalities that have been a part of the state's sports landscape.  The "50 Years, 50 States, 50 Sports" is part of the magazine's 50th anniversary celebration. It began in July 2003 and continues through July 2004.  SI's actual 50th anniversary date is Aug. 16.

      Wal-Mart shoppers in Mississippi won't have to ask where the blueberries come from this year. For the first time, the blueberries on sale at as many as 142 Wal-Mart Supercenters across the South are coming exclusively from Mississippi growers. And a lot of those berries are coming from South Mississippi farms.  The stickers on each blueberry basket in Wal-Mart's produce section proudly proclaims, "Make Mine Mississippi," the slogan of the state agriculture department.  State Agriculture Commissioner Lester Spell kicked off Wal-Mart's two-week promotion of the arrangement in Madison on Monday. The crop has a statewide economic impact of $20 million, Spell said.  Blueberries can reach 90 degrees under the southern sun. They must be cooled quickly at a processing plant before hitting store shelves.

      While watching Harry Potter at the movie for Father's Day, for some reason it hit me why I was so intrigued by a scene in the book I'm reading, The Master Butcher's Singing Club (very good, so far). A young woman finds her lover in the park with another man--she's shocked and relieved, because now she understands why he acts more like a brother than a lover. It hit me right in the middle of Harry Potter that the set-up is very similar to Blanche discovering the sexuality of her husband in Streetcar Named Desire--the beginning of the end for poor Blanche. It got me to wondering how many other stories had similar situations...if you know of any let me know. I would be interested in investigating the thread.  Harry Potter was good (a B or B-, I would say) but a bit long, especially when viewing with a four-year-old. I found myself groaning when they had to go back in time though, because I knew I would too. I don't know if it's because I just saw Mystic River at home or not, but it seemed like both hinged on the idea that changing one small thing in your life could make huge changes in other ways. In Mystic River, the philosophical ones are always wondering "What would have happened in my life if I got in that car?" And Harry Potter's life changed for the better when they went back in time and saved the bird (whose name sounds like Hypocrite but I have no idea how to spell!). What a difference 5 minutes can make, I guess!

      Happy Father's Day to all of you dads out there. All of the gifts that dads bring to their children are overlooked too often, so enjoy your day. I visited my Dad in Waveland a little early and made him his favorite bread pudding with whiskey sauce so Quentin and I could spend Father's Day with his father. We're off to Father's Day lunch and to check out the new Harry Potter movie (which will hopefully be much better than Garfield was!).  Wit and wisdom from my father...  * It's better to be pissed off than pissed on. * Life's not fair...get over it. * I don't care who's right or who's wrong. She's my wife and I have to live with her long after you are gone. * Your ass is grass and I'm a lawnmower.(reserved for special occasions, of course) * Some friends come, some friends go  * You can buy them books and send them to school but that doesn't mean that they will be successful. * Life's too short for cheap whiskey. * Cheap isn't always the best deal. * If you fall, get up, dust yourself off and try again.  * No one ever learned to ride a bike in a day (and Rome wasn't built in a day either). * Buying a tutu doesn't make you a ballerina. But who the hell wants to be a ballerina anyway? * No matter where you may wander (and you need to wander a lot to find this out), there's no place like home. * If you don't have anything else to talk about, there's always the weather and the job. Always. * Just showing up is 90 percent of success. * Growing old is hell. Until you get old, then it sure as hell beats the alternative. * Hot, humid summers beats shoveling your way out of winter any day. * He's your brother and you need to watch out for him--even if he doesn't want you to. * There's no explaining the human heart--it wants what it wants. * Take care of the things that mean a lot to you. * Failure in business does not equate to personal failure. You just got to find the right gig. * We're all still trying to figure out what we want to be when we grow up. Just keep looking...   And, in honor of my father, here is the recipe of the bread pudding I always make for him, one of his favorites:  Bread pudding with Whiskey Sauce  1 qt. half and half 2 cups sugar 1 large loaf Frech bread 3 eggs 2 tbsp vanilla 1 c. raisins 1 stick butter  Tear bread into bits and place in greaded 13x9 pan. In separate container, mix milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla and raisins. Pour over bread and mash bread down till soaked. Top with one stick of butter cut into slices. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  Whiskey Sauce  1/2 cup butter 1 small can evaporated milk 1 cup sugar 1 egg yolk, beaten 1 jigger bourbon  Combine butter, milk, sugar and egg yolk in top of double boiler. Cook, stirring over simmering water till thickened. Stir in bourbon. Serve warm on bread pudding or plain cake. (Or, if you're like my family, just eat it straight out of the bowl with a spoon!)

      This is my first blog. One minute I'm reading an ad about blogs in Time magazine, the next minute I'm an official blogger! Welcome me to the Wide Wild Web. I looked at quite a few blogs before deciding to be a blogger myself, so I didn't take the step lightly.   What struck me most about this medium is people tend to be too specialized for my taste. As I was mowing the yard today (and watching the neighbor's yard boy do theirs), it struck me just how damn specialized everything is now. We can't even mow our own yards anymore, much less clean our own houses or cook our own damn dinners. Thus, my title, Everything And/But Nothing. (Which originally started out as Everything and Nothing, which was taken, and then EverythingNothing, which was taken. Which also got me wondering if this wasn't like the old days on the Web. People were buying all the best blog names and trying to sell them later.)  To make a long blog entry (is that the correct term?) short, my blog will be about everything and/but (sometimes, probably, honestly) nothing...what I'm reading, listening to, doing, dreading, avoiding by blogging, etc. Wish me luck!

      "The pyramid has crumbled," said a food industry consultant.

Food is a $500 billion industry, so "everybody and their dog" is interested, said the Wheat Foods Council president. Concerned groups include the U.S. Potato Board, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Atkins Nutritionals and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The USDA will pay Porter Novelli at least $1.6 million over the next year, for the redesign, slogan, Internet work and educational materials, reports Adweek.

Jolt's Caffeine Energy Gum is $1.49 at convenience stores or online. And you can still buy the Cola there too!

       urlLink Link  - What's phishing? According to Privacy, Inc., "any email communication that looks legitimate, but its sole purpose is to defraud you of your account information and the money in your account." Usually it's an e-mail, purportedly from your bank, your Internet provider or eBay. A problem with your account requires you to confirm your Social Security number, bank account number, credit card information or passwords. You're asked to click on a link, but instead of the actual site you're delivered to a cleverly disguised mock site. The data you enter is captured by scammers who want to steal your identity, drain your accounts or both.  Fifty-seven million people in the United States have been on the receiving end of a phish-ing attempt within the past year. Spend a few minutes at this site to check up on the latest "line" from the phishers. And Internet provider Earthlink offers a  urlLink downloadable toolbar  available to all Internet users. It can alert you before you enter a known scammer's Web site.

      &nbsp;I was impressed with The Station Agent. I was even more impressed when I read that it was McCarthy's first screenplay. He definitely gets the award for the most well-rounded dwarf character in moviedom. But the best part of the movie is that it's really not about being too short--it's about trains. And movement. And freedom. Escape...wanting to go somewhere else (anywhere else!) and finding out that once you get there, it's very similar to the place you were running from. &nbsp; But everyone knows that trains (like blimps) are intrinsically cool. Your first flattened penny after the train rushes by. The sound of&nbsp;a train in the distance. Waving to the conductor. My grandparents had a flea market-type shop in Mobile called The Whistle Stop, because it was right next to the train tracks. I rented a house right across train tracks for years in Gulfport. This movie made me want to go walk the tracks at night again. &nbsp; But I think I've been watching too much Trading Spaces because every time I looked at the train station I kept thinking, "Hey, that would be a cool place if he'd just fix it up a little." And I kept imagining Olivia's paintings in my living room.

There are plenty of blue cities in red states, red enclaves in blue states, red-leaning governors of blue states, people who vote Republican but are of a blue state of mind, and so on. It's not as simple as liberal vs. conservative, elite vs. populist, urban vs. rural, religious vs. nonreligious, educated vs. uneducated, rich vs. poor—if it were, the terms "red" and "blue" wouldn't have taken off as the best shorthand for a divided America.

       urlLink Link  - In an election year when Middle East turmoil has boosted gasoline prices and highlighted America's dependence on foreign oil, a brouhaha has erupted over mileage stickers. The debate boils down to this: Would consumers buy more fuel-efficient cars if they knew the real guzzling potential of America's new-car fleet?

       urlLink Link  - Why is the media now obsessed with gay marriage? The bigger scoop is the heterosexual men who have no interest in marriage, family and children. The Rutgers study in the article profiles the "marrying kind"--pretty funny stuff though it's supposed to be serious.   Last week, I also ran across this  urlLink NoMarriage.com  site--books, quotes, etc. from a lot of upset men encouraging single men NOT to get married. It's funny...and sad.

      Kid Rock wrote the following lyrics about Jackson, MS:  And when the sunshine showed Her face i felt like i was ready to die Went lookin for a place to hide A hole i could crawl inside Long lines Whiskey bottles And the same old song I smell death in the air And i know it wont be long  And i could say im trying to change But thats just another lie Its been a day and a half And im still high  And i feel like jackson mississippi A river runnin Like jackson mississippi A river runnin Like jackson mississippi A river runnin thru my viens  And when the daylight dissapeared I took a good look inside Behind my pride I sat down and cried I know im not a fool But i dont know whats wrong Mabe its time to pack And just move on  And i could say im trying to change But that would just be a lie Im lookin for some one to tell me why   The Kid will now be in Jackson on July 21 at 7:30 p.m. at the Mississippi Coliseum. Tickets are $34. For more info, call (601) 353-0603.  Why Jackson, MS, in the lyrics? Rumor has it that Rock spent time in Jackson when he was writing his first album. (And the Pearl River does run right through the heart of Jackson!)

      New Orleans, home of the oldest continuously operating streetcar line in the world, had done away with everything but the St. Charles line, which runs through the Garden District. But now a third streetcar line just reopened and perhaps a dozen others--including the famous Desire Street line--are on the planning board.  In New Orleans, which once had 225 miles of streetcar lines, the old cars began disappearing in the 1930s. The St. Charles remained because ridership remained strong over the years.  And here's Blanche's famous line from my favorite play, A Streetcar Named Desire:  “They told me to take a street-car named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at–-Elysian Fields.”

I'm just saying before you can eat the whole pie, there's got to be a whole pie there. You just can't eat more pie than there is. If the owner bakes one pie, you can't eat two.

      For the next four to six weeks, patrons of the Kate Skipwith Teaching Museum at the University of Mississippi will be privy to the  urlLink paintings  and writings of one of Ole Miss' own, the late  urlLink Theora Hamblett .  Hamblett, who grew up in a small town called Paris near Oxford, didn't receive any formal training in painting and artistry until she was in her mid-50s in 1955.  Born and raised on her father’s farm in Lafayette County, Miss Hamblett attended a small school in Paris only a mile from home. A teacher following high school, she dropped that vocation to care for her mother who was ill. The year 1939 found her renting rooms to University of Mississippi students in Oxford.  In 1950, the Art Department at Ole Miss began offering adult night classes in painting, and Miss Hamblett realized a long held dream, to paint the vivid colors she had grown to love over the years. She looked on painting as a way to record her religious visions and "the joys and sorrows of a vanished way of life."  Upon her death in 1977, she left her artwork to the University of Mississippi museums.  Other information from:  urlLink The Ogden Museum

      The public housing apartment where Elvis Presley spent his teenage years may soon be a hotel suite like no other. Uptown Memphis now owns the old Lauderdale Courts housing project and has undertaken a major renovation to create 347 apartments renting from $515 to $1,430 a month.  The work includes restoration of the 689-square-foot apartment that was home to Presley and his parents, Vernon and Gladys, from 1949 to 1953. It opened for the first time to public tours for the 27th anniversary of Presley's death at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977.  Uptown Memphis plans to offer the apartment tours on the anniversary of his death each year and on his birthday in January. For the rest of the year, the apartment will be available for private, short-term rentals. Prices have not yet been set.  The complex, built in 1938, is on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of public housing provided by the Works Progress Administration. Closed in 2000, Lauderdale Courts faced demolition.

      I've tried two new recipes in the last few weeks that were worth sharing...  Simple Chicken Mozzarella  Makes 8 servings, 20 min. prep time, 25 min. cooking time. (I got home at 6 p.m. and we has supper at 7 p.m.--and it tastes great too!)  6 (1 1/2 lb) skinless and boneless chicken breast halves (I used the Italian-seasoned,  pre-marinated chicken breasts) 2 eggs, beaten 1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs 2 tbsp olive oil 28-oz can crushed tomatoes in thick puree 1 cup chopped green bell pepper 1 cup sliced mushrooms 1 1/2 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Dip the chicken breast in egg and coat with breadcrumbs. Heat oil in a large skiillet on medium high heat. Brown chicken on both sides and then drain.  In a bowl combine crushed tomatoes, bell pepper and mushrooms. In a large 11x17 inch baking dish, evenly spread 1/2 of the tomato mixture. Arrange chicken on sauce and top with remaining tomato mixture. Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake the chicken for 25 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. (I served it with vermicelli, but the recipe didn't call for any so it is not included in the nutritional info below.)  Nutrition facts per serving: Calories 290, Fat 11 g (cholesterol 110 mg), Carbohydrate 19 g, Fiber 1 g, Protein 28 g.   Source:  urlLink Redpack Crushed Tomatoes in Puree   AND  Lasagna with tomatoes and cheese  1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 egg white Freshly ground pepper, to taste 9 lasagna noodles 2 cups tomato sauce (recipe follows) 3/4 c. shredded skim-milk mozzarella cheese  Combine the ricotta, Parmesan, egg white and pepper.  Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and place noodles in a single layer on sheets of foil or wax paper. (I didn't do this and the noodles were fine. I just drained and ran water over.)  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce over the bottom of the baking dish. Top with three lasagna noodles, then spread with one-third of the cheese mixture. Drizzle with another 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce then sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the mozzarella. Top with three more lasagna noodles and repeat the layers, ending with the mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake 25 minutes; uncover and bake until bubbling and slightly crisp on top, about 10 min. longer. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.  Tomato sauce:  4 tsp olive oil 35 oz can tomatoes, drained and chopped 1 garlic clove minced 1/4 tsp salt Freshly ground pepper, to taste  Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan, then add the tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until reduced to about 2 cups, about 15 min. (I added more spices...oregano, basil and parsley, to taste.)  Source: Weight Watchers' Simply the Best Italian  Suggestions: This basic recipe is very good. I think it would have been too bland for my family's taste without adding more spices, however. And the next time I cook it I am going to add mushrooms and a few veggies to the tomato sauce. And the book says if you use no-boil lasagna noodles you can omit the instructions about the noodles.
