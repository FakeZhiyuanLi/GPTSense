      Suprisingly, i am having my own blog. How strange is it that i would always make critical comments of those with blogs because they are just following the fad, putting their thoughts(real??) just to fill up the blog and present it on the world wide web and proclaming it as their diary. Next, they write rubbish on it justifying their opinions of others also known as bitching or gossiping and consider it unlucky, the victim of their verbal whipping reads about it and takes revenge. They would either leave expletives in the doodleboard or "hail" to the ones that have it out in person or the more gentlemanly way of complaining to higher authorities to rid that evil commentator *laughs diabolically*. Of course, the latter one is a smarter move because you do not risk an injury or charge when having it out in person as temper leads to violence. Moreover, you are also protected by the higher authorities by being annonymous and that leaves the evil commentator bemused figuring who betrayed him/her as he/she must have offended too many that he/she can't remember who.    That is just the first case. Now its reversal of the roles, the blogger becomes the victim of his/her own thoughts. He/she writes hastily anything he/she has in mind and submits it to the www. The readers draw conclusions of what characteristics the bloggger possesses and then as saying  goes gossips spread faster than fire. Then, comes the time when the whole world that revolves around you come to know of your that embarrassing character trait, hobby or what ever that befits people for sniggering/gossiping behind your back. Next, the victim would investigate the case of mischief fire(gossip) and the ending would just be the same like the previous case or maybe better(up to your own imagination)...    ISN'T THAT ENTERTAINING AS A BYSTANDER? to those that are reading, i can see this chain reaction in your mind, the lighting up of neuro-signals, rolling out the scenes in those cases into a dramatic film. Haha, ever considered making it into an oscar winning movie?  Now that we have pointed out such cases let's analyse it. Point 1, you keep a diary such that you can pen out your thoughts or maybe be understood but in most cases its misunderstood. Everybody has a mind of their own to think,say,do or whatever shit(pardon this sudden vulgarity) they want. The world wide web is a free medium for all to use and view, so do not take offences when somebody who is reading your blog makes a comment you dislike and in case 1 too. All humans are the same they only like to hear the good side of things. If you're eveer gonna take offences quintessential to incidents of blogging, make it private then actually you should have seen it coming and done that on day 1. I don't know but it seems to infuriate me when i see people behaving this way i mean where has your sensibility, rationality gone to? Otherwise, you are such a disappointment to the human race. Such behaviour are deemeed to be childish and immature.  Our lives are designed in a balanced equation too much of good or bad will not be healthy. On the other hand, take the bad sides of you that others have pinpointed and turn them into good then you will be balanced and whole. After that, thank those people who have discovered those negative sides of you because they have indirectly paved your road to human betterment. This is a better approach then flaring up or building up all that angst which is unhealthy.  I'm not trying to say i am perfect,a self-proclaimed sage or preach about morality. There are flaws in me too that i am trying to change to achieve that balance equation. I also feel i'm quite shallow, stereotypical, never near intellect ane whole lot more. That leaves me today with this quote.  In the pursuit of an argument there is hardly room to digress into a particular definition as often as a man varies the signification of any term. --Locke.

      Haha, i think those descriptions of my blog sounds rather cheesy or lame. Anyway, school is starting in less than 3 weeks, not sure whether am i fretting or rejoicing. It is a new environment with many unprecedented events and surprises coming my way. In an awkward way, i am looking forward in learning new things, knowing new friends yet prefering stagnantion.3 months have passed with little progress in my life. Everyday is a repeating cycle, sleep late wake up late. Then, look for something to eat or wait for someone to buy it for me otherwise i'll try to cook up anything from the kitchen. Its either junk or not eating anything followed by random surfing of the net then relieving some joy from my xbox games till my mom comes home. I would chat,watch tv, dine with her and sometimes with bro. Getting back some deprivation of fun in my life by staring at my dog or playing with it. Dilly-dallying till i fall asleep. What's worse is that i thought since i am not going to get a job for 3 months i would self-upgrade myself. I promised myself that i would read many books,newspapers that are related to politics,philosphies,business or issues that increases my general knowledge. On top of that, i would learn a lot of vocabulary, write complex sentences. As you can see how i am writing, i had made little or near no progress. i guess even if i want to turn back time i'll still not carry out my promises. Its funny how i would have all that drive and energy to deliver my promises but lose it all in a while. I think i am sad excuse for being human. I have no proud successes in life to inspire others. I shall stop all this self-procrastination.  LET'S LOOK FORWARD TO THIS NEW SCHOOL TERM WITH HOPE OF MAKING LITTLE SUCCESSES IN MY LIFE AND RUB IT THEIR FACES.   here's a little quote i read from newsweek during nature's call:  "The test of a first-class mind is the ability to hold two opposing views...at the same time and still retain the ability to function, "F.Scott Fitzgerald
