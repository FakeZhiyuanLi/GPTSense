      There was a question posed on http://www.lasisters.org recently. Someone asked why did people become a "Sister".   For those who don't know who I am talking about, I am referring to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.   Here is my answer.   Too often people only look at the messenger and not hear the message. (yeah..I know there are some pretty hot looking messengers!) Anyways, I feel as though being a Sister you lose a bit of your individual identity. In as much, you are able to carry the message to others as more of a part of a larger entity than as an individual. You are no longer “Bob, 35, gay, computer tech”.   In face you become “Sister Rhoda Rooter” and are able to carry on the mission of the Sisters.   I have often stated that I don’t feel as though I don’t quite fit in totally anywhere. To be in one group it sometimes feel as though I must deny another part of who I am. Watching the Sisters and getting to know them, it feels as though who they are (labels) isn’t important to the greater good of the group. It seems as though it is about a collective of good souls coming together for common goals.   How I choose to intimately love (or lust) on my own time isn’t a factor here. It is how I choose to care for others in general, seems to be a determining factor in becoming a Sister.   Perceived value is a theory that I subscribe to very much. I see the effort and dedication that it takes to become a Sister and that really draws me in even more. I admire those who have become FPMs. Those who are in the process of becoming FPMs have my respect as well. They give me something to reach for. There is a definite push for each member to better themselves as a person. There is a push for each person to give of themselves without asking for anything in return. There doesn’t seem to be much time to stagnate. Ever pushing, ever testing, ever so gently (or not so gently..lol) expanding each person to reach just a bit deeper into their being to grow inside.   This makes me want to dig deeper into myself and grow as a person as well. It takes the fear out of introspection and enables me to have the courage to face my own character defects. It shows me that there ARE others who give of themselves and understands the fulfillment that it brings all of its own.   I don’t want to be only bisexual, heterosexual, female, switch, mother, daughter, or any of the labels that society has given me. I want to recreate my being to allow all those parts of me to come out as one whole spirit.  WnW

      How much you know.....until I know how much you care.   This is me posting.. as a submissive...stripping my dominant side away totally.    You can correct me if i am wrong..   if i know in my heart it is to teach me i will listen. Because i know you only have my best interest in mind.   But, if i feel it is only to make me feel 'stupid' or prove you are smarter than me, i won't hear a word you say.   You can guide me in the right direction..   if i know in my heart it is for MY best interest i will follow.   But if i feel that it is being done only to serve your needs and you are disregarding what the BEST course for me to follow might be... i will go the other way.   You can tell me of your experiences...  if you listen to mine as well and respect how i feel i will faithfully recall each of your fears, joys and everything in between and be mindful of them in everything i say and do.   But if i feel that you wantonly have disregarded my feelings and not taken them into consideration when you speak and act.. i will close myself off to you and be only concerned with protecting myself.   I need to know you care before i care what you know. Love me and i am yours... i will follow you to the ends of the world and give you my undying devotion.   Try and take the stance of being the Master of my world instead of first becoming the Master of my heart... and i will rebel and neither of us will be content..nor will we survive.   Conquer my heart and I won't even put up a battle for my world.. it will be gift wrapped and handed over freely.    WnW

      I experienced something this weekend that has set me free in so many ways.   I am normal. How can I explain that? For so long I have thought I was damaged or doing something wrong in my submission. I tried to understand and dig deep into myself and find out why I felt like I did while I was in a scene. Why did I cry? Why did I find anger welling up inside of me? Why did I find that I began to hate, only to process it into the deepest love and admiration I have ever felt for anyone in my life?  Why did each scene feel as though I was fighting every step of the way? In essence, fighting for my very life?   I have listened to people say that ‘breaking’ a sub is wrong. I believed that was what happened to me each time. I felt like I was being broken down. I felt as though I needed to have the power, real or perceived, taken away from me. Any illusion of control needed to be removed by whatever means necessary. I submitted myself to have that control removed. The process was never nice. Not in the context of any romance novel or erotic fiction.   For so long I listened to the fantasies of others and their concept of beautiful submission and erotic rituals. I felt less than because that is not the life I live. I don’t understand the draw to the sweet touch of hands to flesh. Tender kisses never did much for me. I was bombarded with people saying I was “topping from the bottom” or “bad submissive”. On occasion I have been told that I should be handing over my control with complete abandon or I shouldn’t be in this lifestyle at all. I felt that somehow I was damaged goods and could never be the “good submissive” I wanted so desperately to be.   I understand raw unbridled passion. Deep animalistic urges that are unleashed by the predator to wreak havoc on the prey.   Ever watch a predator take down its prey? It is brutal and calculated. The prey fights for its life. There is a struggle. The prey screams out for salvation from this fate. But, in the end the prey understands its fate and submits to it. The basic instinct to survive is replaced by a peaceful resolution to let nature take its course.   I am his prey. I see his actions and know in my heart that my predator stalks me. He calculates his every movement and will strike when the time is right. If he is meticulous in his planning, I will be defenseless.   He will take me down. He will break me. It will be nature taking its course with or without my permission. Does the lion ask the gazelle to stand still? My consent was given from the day we met and the dynamics were set in place. It is our life, not anyone else’s.    I watched a predator take down his prey. I listened to him explain his technique to a crowd, yet he was talking to my soul. I heard him talk about a journey he takes with his prey. He spoke about the breaking point. He spoke about the tears that come with that moment of surrender. He spoke about taking that journey with his prey and the profound bonding experience that he shared with his prey. He spoke about the primal desire he felt for the one who took that journey with him.   I sat on the sidelines and cried as I took the journey with his prey. I was watching my kindred spirit being broken and I wept with understanding. I broke down and felt that for once in my life I understood something so deeply that it would forever change my life. I understood the beautiful brutality. I craved it more than I have ever craved it before.   Michael sat by my side and held my hand while I cried. He cried with me. We experienced this moment together and walked away new people.   In the past, I allowed others to instill in me some type of shame for living this way.   I experienced anger towards all those who I allowed make me feel less than. I was angry at myself for listening to all the ones who will never understand the dynamics of my world, yet were determined to change them.   Today, I am not angry anymore. I actually feel sorry for those who are stuck in a world where they are allowing others to dictate their rights and wrongs.   I no longer want to live by SSC, RACK, or other credos force fed to me.   I am seeking out my own definitions, my own spirituality. I am finding those who live as I do that are willing to teach me along the way. I am accepting the dynamics of my life and embracing the beautiful freedom I have found, to live as I do. I am not alone.   When I cried and shared with the presenter the impact he had on my life, he actually had a lot to say. He did say it was natural to break. He spoke with Michael in depth as I spoke with his partner. Others came up to me and inquired as to the nature of my tears. Others overheard the conversations I had and told me they were the same way. Again I cried.   I found the world that I have been searching for. It isn’t in the dungeons or monthly socials. It is in the privacy of small gatherings and intimate friends. It is in the community that reaches out beyond their own needs and contributes to society as a whole. It is in understanding the history and learning the traditions that bind us as a culture. It is respecting that it doesn’t have to be everyone’s culture, but it can be mine.  I now understand that in accepting it as my culture that I have an obligation to respect the work of those before me, and do my part in being a productive member of this community.   I understood the meaning of things that I couldn’t grasp before. I understood the meaning of Trust, Honor and Respect. Those words weren’t new to me, but the meaning became so very clear that day. I understood, better than I have ever hoped to, the meaning of Leather.   I am new all over again. I know nothing but implanted bad information that needs to be expelled out of my head. Misconceptions and falsehoods of who I am or what I should be need to be erased.  Enlightenment is profound. I feel reborn. The canvas that is my mind is fresh and ready for a new picture to be painted. The first strokes have been made… it already looks beautiful.   I am excited all over again.

      ...the world's most horrid person right now.  &nbsp; 10:30pm last night Michael and I were driving down a residential street. I was on the cell with my landlord trying to settle out a fight that her husband and Michael were having. (we are moving..they are selling the house..things are getting hostile with the testosterone makers). &nbsp; &nbsp;I was driving about 20mph in my Suzuki Sidekick (which makes a difference because it is a bit higher than a normal car). It is summer and I am usually pretty damn concious about the fact that there are kids in the neighborhood. Yes, even that late at night people are out and about. It is the desert and the night time is about the only time people CAN come out. &nbsp; &nbsp;I was not paying attention to the road as I should have been. Or was I? I don't know. Everything happened so damn fast.  &nbsp; I didn't see it. I or was I looking and missed it? Did it run out in the road or was it standing there? God I don't remember.  &nbsp; I hit a lil dog with my car.  &nbsp; I felt the impact and heard the yelp. I started crying "oh my god!" over and over.. dropped the cell phone...stopped the car.  &nbsp; Terrified I looked back in my rear view and seen this little shadow flailing in the darkness. (the streets are not well lit). Come to find out it was a shzitu (sp?) type dog, or at least as small as one, if not smaller.  &nbsp; Michael took the phone and told the landlord that I would have to call them back. Then he got out of the car and ran back to the dog. I was frozen. I couldn't move. I was bawling and freaking out. I turned the car around and went back to the place where Michael was standing. The dog had gone to the curb and was laying there. I didnt' know if it was dead or alive. Then the dog moved.  &nbsp; Michael started going from house to house trying to find the owner of the dog. I couldn't get out of the car at first. I sat there bawling. People started coming out of their homes. I felt like an utter fucking piece of shit at that moment.  &nbsp; I finally got out of the car and walked over to the dog. I knelt down and started petting him. He was breathing but it was labored. I cried even harder. I know this sounds so damn corny but I told the dog I was so sorry. He was suffering so bad. There wasn't any blood, but well.. I don't think getting hit by a car feels good. Michael called the police to try and find out how to get this poor dog some help.  &nbsp; Michael finally located the house of the owner. The actual owner wasn't around, but the roommate was home. I apologized profusely. God how fucking horrible can one person really feel? I got a damn good idea last night.  &nbsp; I grabbed the blanket out of the car, we all wrapped up the lil dog in the blanket and walked to the house. The roommate person didn't want the police to come. Her brother works at the shelter and she was going to call him over asap. The house is right around the corner from mine. I gave her my phone number and info on where we live. I told her that if there was ANYTHING we could do to please let me know. She assured me that she would let me know.  &nbsp; ***********************************************  I am too scared to go over there to find out how the dog is doing. Or to see if he made it through the night. Michael is going after he gets off of work.  *************************************  &nbsp; [rant] WTF is with the cops? Do you know what they kept telling Michael? They kept saying "do you want to press charges?" "Is there any damage to your car?" and bullshit like that. HUH? I just hit a fucking dog! I most likely just killed a living being and you want me to not only live with THAT guilt, but compound it by going after the fucking owner of the dog? Don't they think I have cause enough fucking pain in the life of the dog owner already? I was physically ill at the way the cops kept pushing the issue. There ARE some people in this world who know what the hell compassion means. I don't care if I had major vehicular damage.. there is a life involved here and *I* am responsible for cause him and his family pain. If it was a child, would they ask if I wanted to press charges? No.. my ass would have gotten a ticket and my life would be in shambles behind a major lawsuit. [/rant]  &nbsp; I DO equate MY pets as being a member of my family. They are not disposable. I came home and cried even more. I find out in a little bit how the dog is doing. I don't know what I will do if I find out he didn't make it. I feel lower than shit. I am SO not looking for sympathy. I fucked up. I know it.
