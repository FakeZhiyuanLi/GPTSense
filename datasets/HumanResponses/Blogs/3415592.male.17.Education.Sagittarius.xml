      Just to say that I haven´t forgot this blog , but lately I´ve been much busy both with the studies and the "social" life , so I don´t have much to tell ( my life is so boring ;P) so will try to talk about interesting things when they happen ;).

      Yesterday I was given my grades , and surprisingly they were much better than expected. Really the teachers were very generous in some cases.So I got an average of 7.7 over 10 which isn´t very bad ;).So I´m happy for the good results but also a bit sad because some of my friends didn´t pass and have to do this course again =(.  Well that´s all for today, will try to keep this as much updated as possible!

      Today watching the Formula 1 race , I´ve realiced a thing that occurs in our everyday life aswell as in these races. It´s surprisingly frequent to find that many things that we desire and we are going to archive nearly certainly ,end abruptly vanishing right infront of our faces leaving us with a really odd feeling...  Really I don´t really know how I really came to this by only watching a F1 race ;)  Well on the few next days this blog will be filled with everyday stories about school , and life in general.And on Wednesday , , Teh Grades!! ;)

      Well I thoought I should talk a bit about myself..  I´m a 17 year old guy that lives in Santiago the Compostela ( beautiful place) on Spain. I´m currently studying the last course of school before university and I´m hoping to enter Medicine next year.  On my hobbies and likes , well one thing that I love is to travel and  visit foreign countries and meet new people. Other thing that I like is playing with the computer to MMORPGs, that is masssive multiplayer online role-playing games, in the last few years I´ve played to La Prisión( Little spanish jewel of game),Ultima Online, Everquest, Anarchy Online, and finally the one that really got me the most: Dark Age of Camelot ( aka DAoC). In this last game I´ve found the nicest , funniest, best bunch of people that you could ever find in the world, it was the guild Utopia, that had people from all over Europe and made it worth to play the game really. Sadly somehow the guild ended disbanding due to many people leaving ( including myself but thats other point). So that year that I spend with them was the best one in my life. I think I´m going to make my little memory to Utopia by putting all the names of them here: Moth,Gai,Linnet,Liste,Ziera,Dorac,Dez,Zaitenko,Ryath,Mionda,Tzara,Helmer,Fishi,Artful, Mince,Roalith,Vincible,Zelion,Adelle,Nim,Moried,Katri,Amity,Asori,Decard,Aleron,...and of course that little chap that made my life better "Zarilus".  As you can observe that game ment really a lot for me , was a shame I had to leave it but thats another story I´ll tell later.  Other hobbies, hm...., well in music I like Heavy Metal, yeah I know that if you see me I´m not the kind of guy you would expect that like heavy.. So bands like Blind Guardian , Iced Earth, Nightwish ,Hammerfall...  Well, I think that you know me better now ;)  Have a nice day!

      Yay! Well finally I found my time to get myself a blog!  Well I don´t know really why do I create this but I think it´s like doing the diary that I never made ;) Well talking about the present time , not much really , we are having the local festivity here, ironically is a christian one and I´m kinda agnostic ;P . So is much party and stuff right now . On the other side our prince and future king is getting married today in a couple of hours  and I´m feeling like I´m developping an republican feeling ;)  On a more personal note, I really need to start studying for the university access exam  Well that pretty much everything for today( and nothing bad for being the first one)

      Recently I was thinking about certain aspects of the modern society which I can´t really understand.The ideal of a life nowadays is to grow up , study to have a good job and earn lots of money , get married , have children and die...You should be the happiest man on the world if you can archieve this.But it is a prooven fact that this is a very wrong point of view, I mean ,from my perspective I´ve archieved what it´s supposed to be a great goal in my life , enter the university and probably study what I want (Medicine) , but I´m not happy or anything near it since I can´t really archieve what I really want and what would make me real happy.  In conclussion,the goals that the society mark us are not the ones that will make us happy they will only make us survive in this civilization...  PS:I hope this makes any sense , I´m not really used to write this kind of speeches in english ;)

      I´ve not forgotten to post! ;)  Seriously , I´ve realiced that I really miss the good old DAoC , the one that I was playing a year ago.And what I rreally miss is the company ,the "mighty" Utopians .So many good times that I had with them that now I miss them a lot =( . I hope that we can get together again in another game... Or maybe organize a RL meeting ( I shouldn´have missed the last year one =/). Well, that´s everything for today!

      After this brief lack of news ( I was too busy , I promise! ;)) Here is a summary of the last events that have occured in my life untill now : &nbsp; In first place , I´ve entered university as a medicine student \o/ , so maybe in a few years I could be a doctor or something like that ;) &nbsp; Secondly , I´m studying to get my driving license ( ahh!! panic on the roads ;)) If I´m lucky , I´ll get it by the end of september . &nbsp; Thirdly, I´ve been able to put some order in certain aspects of my life&nbsp; that were giving me trouble in this last months.I hope that I´ll continue and fix them finally. &nbsp; I went to a celt festival on the last weekend in a town near here ,and it was an absolut blast! Good music , good company(tho it could be better),drinking   &nbsp; So, well this is a brief summary of the last month or so. In the future ,I´ll continue with my studies on the driving thinguie ,and have some fun with my friends.Also I´m planning a little trip to a foreing contry , I would like to go to some European contry like the UK but also would be interesting to visit a place like Sweden or so . &nbsp; Cya till I remember to post something! ( I´m lazy , I know ;P)
