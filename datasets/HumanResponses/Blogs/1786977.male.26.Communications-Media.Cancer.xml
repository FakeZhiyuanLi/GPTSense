        Car problem???  "gleg gleg gleg ... " hmm... it sounded while taking left turns... What could it be? My absorber on my front right tyre? I think so as i have done some practise on wearing off my tyres on a slippery surface after my gym session while nagging my fren to go back home from his stupid never-ending sicko work. I better get it fixed next month.

        Jig? Gig? Nerd?  I wonder how "JIG" is spelled. I tried searching from  urlLink www.dictionary.com  to get the meaning of it. I din quite get what i want. Maybe i really do not understand the meaning of a JIG, or a GIG, u name it, as long as it has similar meanings to a "Nerd"... OOhh.... I was called a "Jig", how surprising? :P No one actually called me that... perhaps it comes from the way i work... After a 30 minutes group discussion meeting with my boss, i do not know if the "JIG" he ment was refering to a "Technical Expert" :P or just a pure loser. :)... keke... i am always optimistic. hahaha  This event took place 2 weeks ago. I let my mind out to leave some stain on this site. :)

Surprisingly, I have been selected for this game, Ragnarok Online in Bahasa. Yaaahoooooooo!!!... i can play a game of my dreams...

        My First Blog  It's been a blur day to start off with, since I've been up all nite long surfing cum online-gaming cum coding. I should be getting a cup of  Double-Shot Cappuccino  from  Coffee Bean , but all I get is  Double-Tea spoon of Nes'cafe Gold Blend  coz office tadak any super expensive coffee maker/cappuccino maker, which could cost > RM1200. Hey, i need cappuccino to survive, not only coffee!!!.  This is the first blog of my life... since iam beginning to enjoy blogging n reading bloggers' blogs. May as well blog myself for others to dig. :P  Hmm... iam thinking of adding a  urlLink RSS blogfeed  to this site. Still wondering, technically. :)  urlLink http://kalsey.com/tools/blogfeed/

        DON'T FUCK WITH ME, LADY  After adding some extra holes to my wallet for filling petrol, i head from IOI Mall's Mobil petrol station to Bukit Jalil. The jam is terrible, while listening to Shazman and Richard talk kok... it should be a good start of the day... The traffic to Bukit Jalil is piling up, i have no choice but to cut queue, there izzn't much distance left for me the turn heading to work from Puchong.  I noticed the  MAROON UNSER  with the dog tag,  WDN 5888 . It was right next to me when i was 'queueing' from the wrong side of the queue, hoping my ang kong would popi popi me a little, by making the lady in the UNSER give way abit. She challenged me instead. WTF... i don wanna start my day like this... i fought back. After much while fighting, she won by making me stop by the road side with 1cm away from my side mirror... I WAS REALLY PISSED OFF man... i tell you... my head was aching, my heart was pounding... my blood pressure was at peak... I WENT MAD...  Full speed ahead, i chased her to the right turn to Bukit Jalil, surprised her abit by cutting into her way from rear... ahah... that was not good enough. i don think i have done anything by that... i wan my REVENGE!!! i waited her to get closer to me so i can scare her abit... i cut into her lane, not expecting any honkie pankie... she honked me... "THEN DIE YOU MOTHER FUCKER!!!"... i made an sudden brake, sounding my tyres abit, while making others from behind my car to sound louder than mine... nyek nyek  Hmp!!! that should be it... i had my revenge a little, setting my ego high yet by doing some stupid thing again... guess what... she fuckin chased me... just to make me notice her shaking middle finger at her window... hahahahaha... i din c that... Ah boy told me... Ah boy replied a double.

        BRING THEM ON!!!  I am ready for more challenges. While waiting for the source codes to arrive, iam preparing myself for it. I am getting another project from my boss... yahoo!!!... It seemed really lucky for me to get all these nice things, which i have longed. Dunno how true is it, it really turned out as it is from the piece of red paper i got from the 天后宫 TEMPLE. It says that my career will start to BOOST by the end of last year. I partially believed, since it's a good thing to believe in, y not? ^___^  Hohoho... i got my previous job on November 2002, and now i got my current job at the beginning of the year!!! Holy shit... it really happened, din they? Thank you so much. Must be him... he's always been blessing my family... he's inreplaceable... :~(   i missed him so much...

        Yes yes yes yes yes  Last sunday, i finally did it. I got myself a gift that i lasted for years. Chaching!!!... PS2!!!... YAHOOO!!!... deng... i still wish i can have my old PS2 back. For RM850, what can i expect? A modded ps2 with a low yah fake sony joypad loh. I felt a lil happy though, from the bottom of my heart. But it was not what me and my brother felt like 1.5 years back.  So, i got Ragnarok Online, i got PS2, i got a normal job, and i got  PROMOTED !!! ^_______^ It is really something i wanted, although the promotion does not include increment in salary, but i think it's good enough for myself. This is my first promotion, and i've achieved it. Thanks Nils. He's been a great boss and a good fren to me. I am not going to fail him, neither do myself.   Iam in APIIT now, had nothing in my stomach. I wish i can have some nice cool icey chocolaty ice-cream right now. After blogging, i felt a little relieved, somehow. Dunno y... o_O  anyway, i still feel emptiness within myself. >________  My mood today is, GOOD.  ^_________________^  I will have a dinner with my grandma tomolo with yih khai. Oh yarh... no wonder my brother couldn't reply to him, he ran out of HotLink credits. Eff... when am i going to remember to get a new topup card for him???   Out.

        4 months being IDLE has made my life some changes  Today... still striving hard to make a living... but my frens has brought me into something good, something that will make a change in my life rather than sitting in front of my computer, and go back home at 6pm every weekday.  I have join this thing for about 2 months n 2 weeks now. No news yet as i just started 1 month + 2 weeks ago. No pay cheques yet. No surprises. But i do notice some spark in some frens' eyes. They seemed to be searching something what iam searching for, too.   I have made myself a promise that by my age of 30, i will be a changed man. Some one with some influence and somebody in the community. Although iam a "geng" programmer among my frens, but what i seek is far beyond just a "geng" programmer. I wan FREEDOM, financially, and in every other aspects. How do i achieve this status??? Hmm...   Aha... I have a solution... !!!

        For the very first time, i paint my sorrow here... i want a way out... working hard is a very good hypnostic way to numb my heart...   I feel... really really depressed... i have not have these feelings for some time... though it all started during this recent 20 months... I want some time off alone again... even outstation trips can't really help to clear d disorder of my mind... Blasting music i love at least helped a little to ease myself... i still haven't got the cure for this although i know how to cure... iam working my way to get cured...   I reserved today for something for some reason... At this time, 1pm+, i want to get out of the house or so-called my KL home... Yells... shouts... furious anger... created indirect impact on my emotion... I don't feel i want to belong here anymore... HATRED generates within me... furious little devilish me said "i hate these yells... i hate these shouts... Why The F*cK am i still here? To see myself in the mirror of a toilet at Tanjung LamBuDan Hospital?"   I have been accused of being stupid and pathetic for going on thru a hell like this... It's just that these people do not understand... all they see is only the 1 side of the situation... so i rather ignore them and carry on with my plans...   This is a very nice sentense of enlightenment to me that i've learnt from The Matrix : "Knowing the path and walking the path..." Now i know to differentiate these 2 already. Trust me... i've got an evil plan... >:)   I gotto go out now... ciao

       farther away an inch and a half every year receding into the cold infinity of space like the tides or the slow ellipse of orbit  three years old now and still beautiful blue moon comes so rare but no one stays forever  music sometimes wakes things put to sleep put to sleep and laid to rest but we will discover each other again and so begin anew  three years old now and still blue moon comes so rare but no one stays forever
