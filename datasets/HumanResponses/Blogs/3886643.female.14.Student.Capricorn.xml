      Well today i had 3 less hours in driver's ed than the past 2 days (So happy)...well today started off the same as EVERY other. Woke Up did my hair, went to driver's ed. (woo hoo)...then after that me n taylor went down to the dairy center.  I had an ice tea and a corn dog.  Well I got my corn dog, pulled all the stuff around the outside off (as usual) and took a bit out of my dog part.  Well i bit into it and it tasted funny.  So i took another bite...And it was FREEZING COLD....YuCk.  So i told the lady and she said, "O our microwave must be messed up, let me go get another one."  So she went to cook another one and i ate my corn part.  So i got another one.  Well i took  my corn part off, then i took a bite of my hot dog.  the first bite wasn't too bad...but just to be sure i pulled that lil' sucky apart right in the middle.  Sure enough it was FROZEN...Still (yuck!)...So i ate the corn part again.  Then Tree n Tori came in.  Then i went w/ them.  The lady brought an extra order of Fries.  Well Tori told the lady, "mamn, we didn't order these"  So the lady said, oh well, eat up!....So my whole lunch was FREE....I love the Dairy Center (but not their corndogs).   After that i came home and sat here all alone all day with my dog, Bax.  In the whole time i was here i started thinking....and i decided it sux when ur single, and ur not @ the beach....Cameron (from the real world) said it all..." I Need A BOY! I Need Some LuViN!" haha...Well I watched Walker Texas Ranger for 2 hours (gotta luv it).. Then came n got on the computer...i have been so gosh dern bored!...Gah I Gotta Talk To Somebody Bad, i wish he'd hurry up n get home...*Im Out*

      Wow today i did almost nothing....at least it seems like that, haha.  I went to our "new church" in the mornin....It was weird...almost nobody was in the traditional "church dress"....Everyone had on jeans and sweatshirts.....really weird...what happened to respect...but w/e....  Anyways it was regular church beyond that.  I saw lotsa people my age there, didn't talk to them, but i did see them...  Then we came home and i played some motorcycle racing game on the Xbox...it was boring.  Then we went to the YMCA to go swimming.  We went into the indoor pool.  the one thing that bugs me about indoor pools is that they are so freakin chloriney....When we came home i had to put the little droppeys in my eyes about 3 freakin times, cus they burned like heck.  Then we came home and i played this sniper game on the xbox, i think it was the scariest video game i've ever played.  It was in this insane asylum and there were all these insane people walking around and then in rooms some were cutting up people!....i thought they were gunna get me!...how scary...anyways then i had ribs fer dinner then i played more xbox and thats about it..........how fun, my day was really boring..........oh well...Im Out

      Today was perdy Boring....but i did go shoppin'...haha. Today i went to look @ apartments and condo's with my mom's new husbands mom....wow how fun. The lady had a freakish obsession with yellow....i have no clue why because her yellow shirt did nothing for her complexion and made her look fat.......but anyways we walked through this model apartment and everything was yellow ...the walls, the furniture, the bedspread, and almost every linen, and her shirt.  Psycho Yellow Freak ....anyways...after that we came home, then later we went to hanes to get me the shoes i wanted fer school. We went to Pacsun for the second time in a month and they didn't have my size in the awesome black and pink Etnies i wanted....Stupid Losers...so then we strutted next door to Finish Line where they always have my size. And we showed them the shoes i wanted and those stupid losers didn't have my second choice in my size. So Then we went to Lady Footlocker (Whata Great Store)...and THEY had my size in the awesomely kool dark grey and pink New Balances....So i got them, and this neat-o duffel bag, perfect for soccer (Yip-ee).............Thats about it, except i just saw this stupid add for windows.......*Buy 2 Windows, Get One Free!*....What The heck, if u buy two windows more than likely won't u need quite a few more, for instance if ur building a house.... i mean who needs 3 windows? That should be like cursed or something...Gah people these days...I'm So glad i made it through Friday The 13th Safe N Sound...haha...Actually somethin good did happen...i talked to the guy i like....but it's hard to guess who he is...seeing as i talked to about 25 peolpe last night.....about 15 being guys...haha...thats about it fer real.....right now im listenin to Get Tangled Up In Me, Whata Great Song...I recommend it go to launch.com and listen to it,it's great. Oh Yea..I Wanna See The Exorcist, The Beginning, Looks Scary!!!................Well Im Out

      I Have Not Written in what seems like eternity....but who cares, nothin good goes on in this stupid town anyways...worst of all i know nobody here...well cept one person. I Just Can't wait till school starts so i have SOMETHING to do!....I've only heard from a very select few of the friends who "couldn't believe i was leaving" and would "miss me so much"....Figures. It seems as if some people don't even seem to care enough to even pick up a freakin phone and call...and i know it sounds like im relying on others to try to communicate with me but i have called house phones and left messages...so i give up, if they ever wanna come over or get together they can arrange everything themselves, cus i give up. Anyways on a semi brighter note, i am really crushin on somebody, too bad nobody knows who he is!....haha, at least i think no one does...haha. And no, it's not one of the grocery store check out guys, though i must say Lowes Foods has had a fine selection of guys to pick from in the past few weeks. Anyways my mom was telling me about one of my step dad's friends critisizing Bishop Mcguinness as being where all the "wild rich kids" go....I guess people under that category can't be too bad.....5 days till' school....and counting. ...Oh yea...Taylor And Nat , Ya'll are the bomb, thanks for fillin me in on everything and actually talkin to me...haha
