      So It's my birthday tomorrow and like Christmas there is like nothing I really want.  I mean I was able to think up some DVD's and CD's I'd like but for like 20 years of my life whenever a occasion came around where I got gifts I always asked for games or toys.  But with my damn job I play all the games I want as soon as I come out.  Damn that job of mine.  So I'm gone down to bako tomorrow night.  And I'm not sure if Christine told ya'll wrong or what but Friday night I was gonna have dinner with me madre (we can still do magic later though)  But no bbq or draft Friday.  Saturday however is another thing.  We can draft or just get together and play and hang out.  Thing about drafting is that its like $10 a person so I dunno if ya'll are down to spend money or not, other thing is it will take like 3-4 hours at least me thinks.  Damn fun though.  I'll be down for either Not sure what alfred's plans are but I guess he bought a couple of decks himself and he is itching to play also so I'll have to talk to him about drafting.  Anyways So since jac left me a blog I assume your gonna be in town.  Anyhow if all ya'll can get back to me by the end of the night I can pick up all the packs on my way into town so that we don't have drive cross town, then ya'll can just gimmie $10 anyhnow I'm done time to play some Ground Control 2 and eat some dinna.

      Well its been a while since my last post.  Well Magic is like the best game ever had a total blast playin with everyone back in bako.  Cant wait to play again now that i have my crazy deck all ready to go.  Saw Chronicles of riddick Best action movie i've seen in a long time.  Next it spider man 2 cant wait to see that.  Ugh i watched master and commander last night very unimpressive.  I think it succeded in being a good naval movie but damn did that movie drag along.  I need a new CD to listen to for driving to work. I think i have listened to my current CD like 8 million times.  I would ask for sugestions but i think i know what they will be, johnny cash, umm.... some indie band i've never heard of, and well no freakin idea what jac would suggest.  So do u all still play SC?  Havent talked to rock in a bit so not sure.  we should get together and try some WC3  We could all team up and get schooled by the cpu.  Anyhow christine is getting out of the shower so i think its time I take her to go shopping (yay!) intereseting side note.  I love when new games come out with random names b/c I get to hear my customers give their interesting take on it.  So Psi-ops came out yesterday and sure enough someone called and asked for "fizz"ops  which jordan responded with no but we do have psiops,  the customers response "you know when ya'll gonna get fizzops in?"  Ahh some times i love retail.

      So I just finished Chronicles of Riddick: escape from butcher bay and I must say damn was that a good game!  Very rarely will I finish a game all the way through.  Games tend to lose steam towards the end, But this game I thought I beat the game a couple of times only to be foiled at the last second.  So I practially beat this game like 3 times, and never slowed down.  Cant wait to see the movie now.  So if any of ya'll are interested I'll;l be seein it Friday night 8^> now I know rock is a hater, but Brandon and jac if your interested lemme know maybe we can work somethin out.  So now I guess I'll get started on Full Spectrum warrior, which I hear is equally awesome.  Hey rock lemme know if you wanna play tonight, or manana.  Oh and all you guys who actually play magic with me 8^P I had a sick ass idea for a nasty ass deck that I'll hopefully get runin b4 next time we meet. Adios all

      Ok so after like 2 days of watching smallville i have to say its actually pretty damn good.  I dont know if its up there with Buffy and angel but still pretty good.  But nothing can touch those freaking japanese anime's as far as tv shows.  Ah well, So Rocky you need to cave and play magic with us all its pretty fun, and we could have some crazy 5 player free for all action.  Dude Lex Luthor is the man, he is the best person in this freaking show.  (sorry the wife is watching as we speak)  Anyways, we should all figure out a time and place to get together, be it SB or Bako.  I would say we could all meet here but um kinda lackin on the space aspect :( but we should all but the diff's behind and just hang out be it rocky comin to bako or brandon and jac goin to SB I'm down for either so me and rock should see if we can schedule a day off toghether on the weekend or see if b-dog can get a weekday off.  Whateva though, anyhow I loveded you guys, I loveded you ;)    p.s.  Invader Zim is the shizey for nihzey

      So it seems Blogging, has be come less frequent for us all, i'm not sure if the mystique has worn off or what, maybe we just dont have as much to say, maybe we just dont feel like spending time to write it down (prolly the last one for me at least).  So lets see what has been goin on, Saw Spiderman 2 damn fine movie, Now i'm just crossing my fingers that the symbiote will show up in three, dont think venom will but i think spidey vs. himself would be cool, and it would set up venom for the 4th.  Oh just finished the game today that game is so freaking awesome just the sense of coolness you get while swinging through NY and running along a skyscraper to jump off grab a light pole jump from that then go back to swinging, never gets old.  well maybe eventually.  but not yet.  Oh found pictures of a sic ass GBA i want.  lets see if i can post them... http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3133239&did=28 Any ways that looks awesome.  What else  Oh started watching a sweet ass new anime called wolfs rain, done by the people who did cowboy bebop i think its actually on adult swim on saturdays.   But me lacking cable bought it at the store with my b-day money, its pretty cool though, maybe we'll watch it next time i come down.  Which brings me to my real reason for posting.  So me and christine are prolly comin to bako this weekend i should have sat and friday off, so rock or jac if ya'll could come down that'd be awesome, I think i am gonna bring my naurto game this weekend and we can get some 4 player GC action goin.  Next thing me and christine were thinkin ya'll should come down one weekend b/c we found this real sweet netcafe place where its like $8 for 4 hours on the system, and they have a group discount as well.  And there is a sweet arcade across the street thats open till like 4 am.  Anyways though it would be fun to get together and just play games like we used to at tournament software.  anyhow i'm off things to do citizens to save.
