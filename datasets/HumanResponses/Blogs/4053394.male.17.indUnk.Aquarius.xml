       Francis is my name, and i am a beginner bassist. Trying my best to practise for my one a biggest dream! That is to form a band with my friends. We&nbsp;target english rock, though&nbsp;i myself prefer chinese and jap rock.&nbsp;But through my friends'&nbsp;persuation, I decided to try it out. It's hard to enter the&nbsp;english rock market, cos nevertheless, white skins hate&nbsp;the yellow skinned, thus therefore they will definitely not support. Without the white skinned market, it's hard, god damn hard.     Ok,&nbsp;enough of my dreams, now to introduce myself further. I am a 17 year old&nbsp;chinese&nbsp;boy,&nbsp;sporting black short hair, little funky hairstyle, i'll try and post my pictures later. I'm not studying, cos i need to work for money to fuel my dreams. I'm around 1.7 to 1.74 metres tall, about&nbsp;55 kg. I like to sing, play soccer, snooker,&nbsp;use the computer, slack, smoke, do nothing but dream all day long.&nbsp;I play the bass and&nbsp;I like to go shopping around with my friends.     I'm new to the blog stuff, so if anyone can help out, please do so by mailing me at  urlLink dreamz@pure-fm.net . Thnx alot.&nbsp;    About today, its my off day&nbsp;at work, so i've been slacking at home, and also practising my bass. Doesn't get anywhere better. Met up with my friend to discuss about our songs.&nbsp;currently, we've produced 4 songs of our own.&nbsp;Not too bad for a start. Got really excited and we discussed our plans to get more attention from the public.&nbsp;How we intend to let the public know us. Haven't found a name for our group, and we only&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of 3 people. A guitarist, a bassist and a perfect drummer. He's the best!&nbsp;Haha. Basically, thats all we've got. We're looking for a good male vocalist, or even a second&nbsp;guitarist. Anyone with music talent and wanna be in a rock band, willing to share expenses, ups and downs and experiences &nbsp;can mail me too. I'll arrange a meet up. No harm trying&nbsp;ryte? Ok, Thats about it. I'll update more later. Bye!&nbsp;
