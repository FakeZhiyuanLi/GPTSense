      ok...for the record...it might suck major. I dunno, only had one rehearsal so far. It's not looking good considering we have about 70 ppl in the cast. It's gonna suck...I love my one line too...Master, Master! Blessed are the poor in spirit... n that's it...I'm ashamed man...but I guess I can't help it. And it's not my fault I was in the very back of everyone and Loren couldn't see my freakin hand raised for the dumbass better lines. GRRRRRR So yea...I'm done bitchin about it for now. If you wanna come for moral support or w/e, it's August 5-7...7:30...bla bla bla...I don't have a life anymore btw...

      I'm scared to show my emotions. Don't wanna get hurt again. I think I made another wrong decision. But that's the story of my life.  Too many wrong turns, not enough back roads. No wonder I have little strength. But I'm guessing I have no choice, Can't have my own voice.  Why am I so torn? I try to be happy, but inside I'm sad. I let on I'm fine, but I want a better life, A better home, that I'll gladly claim. Take me in, comfort the sin of wanting to leave. Am I alone?  ............Yea..so, I can't remember the rest of it off the top of my head...but next time we're hangin out n there's a piano in our presense, I'll play it for ya...I'm still havin difficulties w/ "Why do I Bother" n it's tickin me off...grr! lol...so yea...on w/ the show...g'night

      I am officially a lobster. There was a choir car wash today. I was @ Herr funeral home from 9-1:30. I don't know the last time I've been this burnt. AND my left side is worse than the right because the sun was beaming down on that side more. So I can move my hands and my neck, but it's just too complicated to do anything else. Never go outside for multiple hours wearing cheap sun block. It doesn't work man...It doesn't. And I went to sleep around 4 am...I was extremely crabby when I woke up...not cool. O yea, get this. There's gonna be a new movie comin and it's Alien vs. Predator or w/e...I thought they made a mistake w/ Freddy vs. Jason and I thought the industry would learn from that. But no. They have to go and ruin two more classics. I just thought I should mention the injustice. AND I have to see Anchorman..We'll make a party out of it lol! *JULY 9*

      Dudes...I was just sittin around doing nothing and then out of nowhere, Brad called and asked me to the movies. Being annoying as they are, the rents wouldn't let me hitch a ride w/ him since he's only had his license for exactly a month. And I had to argue that it wasn't a date and that if it was somebody else, I would have been able to hitch a ride and go in peace. But I was desperate to get out of the house and I wanted to see Dodgeball and Brad can be a nice kid so I agreed that my mom would take me. It was a lot of fun. I thought it would b weird, but we just hung out. I didn't even hafta pay for my ticket lol. I'm $6 richer than I thought I would b at the end of today. So yea, for now, Brad is like a savior in a way. I haven't laughed that hard or that much in a long time. I know that I mentioned this, but hey, it's the truth. For almost 2 hours I was back in a place that I had missed so much. I was happy. For 2 hours I didn't have to worry about anything. It was nice. In other words, see that damn movie! It's so dumb in parts, it's great. I have to disagree w/ Brad and say that Spaceballs IS the better movie and is not equally funny. But we all know that Holy Grail is the god of all funny movies. I should see funny movies more often which reminds me...I need to call a friend. So yea...I'm never gonna go to sleep so I'm gonna try to convince my mama that I'm sick and I shouldn't have to go to the carwash for choir. I don't like morning shifts...that's all...

      Wow...curfew was a bitch. Nuff said. We stole some pamplets from the hotel and stuck em in our room. We went to the church on Irving Park. They gave us donuts. The kids of the Interfaith Choir were as upset to b there that early as us. We had to have nametags and since ppl thought that me, Katie, and Megan were sisters, we came up w/ the Smaxter Triplets by combining our last names and we put that on our nametags. We sang w/ Dr. Rollo Dilworth (s.c.) who actually believed that we were sisters, but when we took a pic w/ him we explained. He had a good laugh. But yea, he was amazing. We were so surprised he was young lol. He's composed like over 50 pieces of work and he's an awesome pianist. Boy's got soul! lol So we sang w/ this other choir. I thought their director was wicked creepy. We ended up singin ALL FREAKIN DAY. We took a break for lunch n after a while, Rollo had to go. The director of Interfaith arranged for recreation. There were three options: 1)Go outside, pray it doesn't rain n have a "good time", 2)Go outside, play in the rain, 3)Go to the gymnasium. Well, we, the Smaxters, didn't like those options so I mentioned we should ask about Secret Option Numba 4: shopping. We convinced Joel n Jeanene to let us go shopping. So a few of us escaped to participate in the infamous SON4 and we rode the "L". It was rainy and 50 something degrees outside. So we're walkin down State St. I think, and these little black boys, about 10 years old were riding their bikes and the one kid was like "You have a nice ass" And I was like excuse me? and he repeated it. And the kid on his bike behind us was like I think you have the nice ass, refering to Katie. So I learned my lesson in wearing shorts in Chicago: just don't. After that oddness, we shopped for about 20 minutes then had to go back to the L. We were caught in the rush hour traffic of it all and you really get to know people well after being smashed and stepped on a few times. Especially since we had to transfer trains. So we sang and sang and I had the worst headaches. The kids in Interfaith liked my shirt *ORLANDO!* and my nails *black n pink checkered!* After the concert, we hid in our little stairwell away from the littler kids like we had been. Then we left. We talked to Paul to let us ditch the museum the next day and continue son4 and he told us he'd think about it. They made our curfew 10 instead of 10:15 n we couldn't go into guys' rooms n they couldn't go into ours n it was kidna goofy. While I was startin to pack up along w/ Katie, I called my mom n filled her in n w/e. I got a part in Godspell Jr! I'm gonna b one of the soloists, but I think Loren overcast it...but there will prolly b a lot of kiddies dropping out like flies in weeks lol. Megan n me went to the computer while Katie talked to Al her bf *awww* I informed a few ppl and Brad's gonna get the Thezzies to come...I hope lol. I'll call Mitch, he'll get it done. So then Megan and me got back to our room after talkin to ppl online right before curfew lol. We then just talked and packed and looked at my pics of my goofy friends from school. So continues our adventures of the Smaxter sisters and others...btw, Paul denied son4 for the next day.

      How can a man who has a nice kitchen table need another one? How can a man who has a nice TV need another one? How can a man who has a twin bed, a futon, and bunks need another bed? How can a man who has a cd player need another one? How can a man who has a nice truck living in our garage need to trade both the red truck I was hopin to get and his car so he can lease another truck to get more money? (There's nothing wrong w/ the nice Harley Davidson truck!) How can a man who has no yard need a riding lawn mower? How can a man with most of the niceties and accessories of life need more? I dunno, but I'm still stumped with the lawn mower...

      Ok, the trip started out quite well. Once I got on the bus there were like zero little kids n it was like just me, Tim, Clark, n Michelle so I broke out the chorus part to "Get Low" n that was the theme song for the weekend I think...well, the theme song that wasn't one that we sang as a choir. So we're on the road for a while...Aaron raided my seat when I went to the very back to visit Clark n Tim. I made an Out of Order sign and on the opposite side it said NO NUMBA 2! And a little girl was like what's number 2? So Clark put the 'ghetto' version of number 2 which is puping *don't ask* and yo cuse! was the phrase of the day...he has spelling issues. We stopped at one of those places n it said no smoking so I was kinda upset for no given reason and some of them thought I smoked and I was like if I smoked, would I be here? So yea...madness w/ smokin. After our long 5 hours on a bus, we got to the hotel and Katie ended up w/ the wrong duffle bag. It was Tim's. We found these orange swimming trunks. We went to his room and waited for like 15 minutes to give him these trunks and we thought we'd surprise em on the elevator so whenever the doors opened, Katie jumped in front of em and was like "Do these shorts look good on me?" But we scared this one lady and a few guys. Joel ended up getting us. We caused them to b 10 minutes late from leaving to go get pizza @ Giordano's. So we ate, went back to the hotel. Got crappy news that our curfew was 10:15 so we *me Katie n Megan* unpacked and started watching The Others. After a while, we went to the pool but we were kinda freaked w/ the movie. We were on the tenth floor n the elevator stopped on the 6th and there was like NOBODY there. We just looked @ each other like OMG and then this dude walked around the corner and got on. And we busted out laughing and explained to this confused man that we just got done watchin The Others. n he offered us pizza...Weirdness lol So nobody was at the pool and we needed towels for our rooms. We went to the front desk and asked for towels and we found the sacred computer. So we talked and just got off b4 curfew lol. So we went up to our room, bounced on the beds and went to sleep.

      I thought that I would be able to go to Chicago and just blow off some steam, but once again, I'm reminded of my padre. He left a card for me in the mailbox cuz he didn't think I'd want to talk to him. It's a kitty pawing at something and it's just...I didn't need that right now. It's like I'm haunted by old memories of him. And it just hurts so bad. I'm back to crying constantly and I...I...I just shouldn't have opened it. It's the little things that always get to me and that will never change. I just don't want to hurt anymore. I just want to be free to live 'normally'. Or as normal as I can. I just feel so guilty cuz I still love him but I still hate him. I'm just so confused. And I can't stop crying and I need someone to talk to but since it's 8:30, I don't think my chances of finding someone awake are that good. I just need something and I don't know what...So I'm leaving today. I'm livin it, I'm leavin it to change And somehow I miss it. I think I really miss it...yea, stole from a song...I need to find love again because it's lost and I don't remember what it feels like to have love. Or compassion. Or happy memories. I need help...I just want for one minute to feel that way again. But it's not comin....I talked to Ben S. last nite *thezzy* and we just talked for a while and I need to start talkin to him more often man. He made me realize that I'm loved no matter what. But the thing is, I can't love back. And if I can't even do that, how can I feel that strong of an emotion? I'm trying to find God in all this, but I can't see the light and it scares me. I don't wanna lose God. I don't want to lose everything that I might slightly care about. It's just so much bad has happened I can't be positive. So I leave you with my tears of sadness, not joy. I miss everyone already. I don't know if I really want to go anymore. All I really want is to just be HAPPY

      The thezzy party was fun...mandy n me were throwing a plastic cup then ben n mike were tryin to get it away from us n then mandy threw it back to me, then ben pinned me down n i eventually bit him and he loosened grasp. we just kept goin n goin n now i have the worst rug burn...i was bloodyish. then at another time, he like held my arms behind my back, i got loose, so he grabbed me by the waiste, picked me up, n then plopped me onto the couch. n then mandy threw the cup over their heads n landed on me on the couch so i stuffed the cup down my shirt n ben was like oic...n then he was like should i try? or sumthin to that effect, but then he gave up. Cup fights are FUN especially when there's only like 4 ppl there at the time. We then played outburst and watched Secret Window. That's when ppl started showin up. Kyle n I had a poking match...I swear I won lol. N then I played air hockey. It's a tradition, what can I say? n I ended up talkin bout my father, the bastard n kate the bitch. so yea, interesting. i almost died too...i choked on a pepperoni n they turned off the lights n the basement while they were playin video games n i was like chokin out i need sumthin to drink! n then i started flailing my arms n kyle was like omg here! n i couldn't open the can n then he's like omg! thats the last orange, so weebles tried to give me pepsi but the orange came thru even tho weebles held the pepsi like an inch by my face. so i thanked kyle for savin my life even tho he's convinced that was part of my secret plot to take the last orange, n i told him he has a small place in my cold heart n he was like i could thaw ur heart n i was like u kno u wanna. O good times. But good times don't last for me...O no...Mom got me 15 minutes early and I was kinda mad that I didn't get to stay longer even tho I'm goin to Chicago tomorrow n hafta get up early. Not that I care. But I realized that I don't care anymore. It doesn't matter to me if I get in trouble, if I just get up and leave. I don't have anything to live for anymore because it's all been robbed from me. My only family are my friends. I'm absolutely depressed and I don't want to live like this. I want to go away and start over. I don't want this family. I don't have a father, and my mom isn't necessarily happy w/ me. So I warned her that I was gonna just start sneakin out n stayin @ other ppl's houses. I don't care if I get caught by cops. I DON'T CARE. Supposedly, I'm all my mom has and she can't go on w/o me, blah, blah blah...it's out of my hands. I wish I could care. I wish I had love. I wish I had happiness. I don't want to be depressed anymore. WHERE'S MY GOOD? There's always bad and it keeps following me like a sick puppy that wants a home. Just...help me escape. Please...

      One hell of a day yesterday. I'm still stressin n crampin man...it sucks. I can't go swimming cuz that's jut not cool. I refuse. Well, now I have a reason to be bitchy at people on the bus. *YES!* And I need to call Brian or Cindy...my people...my other Highland people lol. along w/ their chilluns, my stoopud freshman n my mini me. Hopefully they can give me a ride on Wednesday. If my dad shows up to take me, I'm just not leavin the house I guess. I'm trying to find the good shit n life n it's hard. All I can remember is bad stuff. That's all I can recall clearest. I must seek guidance from Mitch my "shoulder" n the exceptional one cuz I miss that dude. I shouldn't have to give up on guys but I'm forced to. No flings for now. No using certain beings although since I'm extremely vulnerable it's possible. Who knows anymore. Can my life get any worse? Yes...it surprisingly can. It's really sad. I'm not even happy bout shoes or painting my nails man. I thought that maybe if I inhaled enough nail polish fumes, I would feel better, but then I was like dude, don't try to get high cuz that's lame. So I didn't but since I had to paint my nails, not much of a choice. *shrugs* I just wish this pain would go away. I wish I wasn't so bitter. I wish I cared about things I once cared for. But it's like...too late. I have no emotions...no true emotions. If I cry, it's for no reason or for the littlest thing. Nothing big anymore. I can be good at phoniness. I must get that from my dad. The only difference is that I'm better. Since I don't remember what else I was gonna bitch about due to the fact that it's 8:45 AM and I haven't had slept since noon yesterday because my loving padre came over, I'll be back later. But for now, I must eat...I'm thinkin cheeseburgers...n macncheese...HOTTNESS!

      Well now. Earlier I had to leave because my dear father was comin into my presense n I was REALLY tryin to be nice to him while he was around. Once again, he had an excuse to leave. "Jeremy" was takin him out to dinner. I was like w/e...I don't give a crap. So he left. My mom was gonna do some investigation n go check @ kate's n then dad's apartment. i was tryin to have some faith in him but ya kno, laziness too took over n i'm pissed that it did. she found them @ my dad's. just last week he mentioned he wanted to work on coming home once again. that's a p.o.s. remark. my mom had words w/ them n she threw a pic of the two of em @ the wall, smashed it, n the wall's dented. I'M SO F-IN PROUD! cuz if I was there, more damage would have been done. My mom told Kate that I hate her n Kate got offended. GOD FORBID Kate gets offended. She can kiss my white gurl ass. God I'm so mad that I wasn't there. But yea, mom came home, told me everything that happened. Here I am regretting not going. THEN Dad calls over here. I was like kno what, I can be phony too. N then he was all worried that mom was gonna ruin his things that he's gonna 'move out of here' *cough lie* And I was like you'll be lucky that I don't destroy your precious possessions because I'm more likely to than her. So yea. Kate always has this thing with telling people she'll pray for them. So I shoved that into his face. I was like "Dad, I'm gonna pray for you" like all sincere n shit. My mom was clapping for me cuz Kate's a prissy bitch who's oh-so-religious and wants to pray for the world! It felt good. Then my mom left to talk to my uncle bout more insurance stuff cuz my dad was bein an ass earlier. And then...about 10-15 minutes ago. He had NERVE to call back! I was like listen, we're gonna make arrangements for somebody else to take me to the bus for chicago. Then he asked for my mom, I told him she wasn't here. He was like yea...right. And I was like boo...like I would lie. If I did, I would do a better job than him. And then he was like this isn't between me n you, this is between me n your mother. I was like dad, this IS between me n u. It's your fault too. You insist on hangin onto Kate who I despise more than I can say. And it's really hard to hold back cussin cuz my parents don't know that I do. It's gettin harder n harder everyday. O yea, back to my story. I explained that all these times that he's been wanting to come over or go to my honors stuff, they've been out of sympathy. I didn't want him at any of those things and the reason why I didn't wanna go out to eat for lunch today was because I didn't wanna b seen in public with him. So now, I'll limiting him to an optional telephone call everyday. All I know is, I'm NOT callin him while I'm gone. I told him that he depresses me and that if he returned, I would become insanely depressed. But since there was never hope, my mom is gonna try to get a lawyer I think *finally* *sighs* He still hasn't listened to the tape I gave him. I wouldn't be surprised if he chucked it. O well, it'll haunt him and I'll make sure he listens to it. So at the end of our convo I said in a phony cheery voice, imitating Kate whether he knows it or not, HAPPY FATHER'S DAY DAD! BYE! slam. Ahh...it's so nice to yell at him....I'm gonna put an ad in the papers for a new father. If any of your parents would be willing to partially 'adopt' me, TELL ME. I'll gladly be your sister *n that would kick*. So my love to all fathers...you can all kiss my ass.

      Okay...yea...Happy Fathers Day to you dads out there that might read this. You'll prolly appreciate my wishes more than my dad appreciates em. There is a lack of communication when he comes over, hence my blogging at this minute. My mother n him are talkin bout insurance. Sorry, but that's just stupid. Can't they do this some other time? Well, no...he's never around any other time. Go figure. So now I'm wasting my time doing nothing. It's a pointless celebration. I deserve two days dedicated to me more than he does, that's for sure. But I don't necessarily want to discuss his doings to turn my life into a living hell right now. It gets rather dull after a while. As much as we would all like it, he'll never change. Even Patti's fiance Eric *my "bro" in Iraq* has purdy much disowned my father even though he doesn't know him well. That's just pathetic. But of course my dad knows nothing of this. He doesn't know much of anything. He still thinks my mom is makin up everything I tell her that she relays to him..bbl

      Dude...last night I went w/ Betsy to St. Louis Mills shopping mall thing. It was hella fun! We stopped by the dollar store and bought these huge peacock feathers 3 for $1 lol. And I swear the guy that works there was hittin on us. Then we went to Hot Topic. Those people were the coolest. We talked about Harry Potter and crap, and the cashier lady was like dissin' all the other Hot Topics and then we talked about Harry Potter some more hehe. And they weren't like the creepy ones at our Hot Topic. They didn't have the oddness to them which was awesome. They were like normaler lol. We went through the whole mall like 2 or 3 times. Raided a piano store and played "Bohemian Rhapsody" but then one of the workers was coming towards us so we ran away. Then we went to this Unique Boutique store and there was nobody in there. All of a sudden we're lookin at shirts and the guy that works there was like MR. BUBBLES! *refering to my shirt* He scared us sooo bad. And he was like the weirdest person just watching us as if we're gonna steal somethin. And he kept asking us questions. People can be too nice...fo sho. Then we traveled to Journeys and I was like OMG! Look at the socks! And one of the guys was like so THAT'S why you came in huh? And I was like excuse me, the shoes. They were awesome converse btw. Then we were talkin bout the guy's shirt...Homer Old School. And the chick workin there was reinacting the shot lol. And they complimented our peacock feathers. They were like OMG! Those are sooooo cool! They were so geeky but they were the greatest. So yeah. If you ever go to the STL Mills, go to Hot Topic and Journeys! Tasha, I bought a hott Sirius Black shirt and I thought of you. :) Then I bought a Rocky Horror shirt and my mom was like you've got to be kidding. lol good times good times. When are we goin shoppin again??

      Ok...yea...I got to see those lovely spiders of Iraq again. They're like 2-3 feet long and wicked creepy. The picks are courtesy of my 'brother' Eric who's been stationed there since...hmm...March? *shrugs* He's a fun kid. But yea, if you thought our spiders were disgusting, you should see these, so be thankful! I think I'm scarred...I'm like Ron...YOU TELL THOSE SPIDERS RON! hehe...come back soon Eric! Kick some Iraqi butt! *I wonder what his job is over there lol...who knows*  Dude...I remember what I wanted to BLOG about earlier. I had a dream yesterday and there were Amish ppl in it. I thought it was quite amusing. Figured I should share that info w/ ya. Also, fun fact. Smicksburg, Pennsylvania, said to be named after my lovely ancestors *not sure if it's true, I have no proof* is an Amish town. Ok, since we're already goin to Disney World, Bryan's house for a riot, and California while singing that song for our road trip next year *YAY!*, we should stop by Smicksburg or at least one Amish town. Then we can pretend that our cell phones are posessed by the devil and tell ppl that if they anger the phones, there will be a plague, and just simply drive the town to madness. It'll be fun...Waddaya say? What a wild imagination, I must say...lol CRACKERS UNITE!

      I had a concert earlier. It was hella boring. I was proud of myself. I actually invited my dad...erm...last minute and he couldn't come which made me slightly content. It was decided that I am a very bitter person that doesn't like the world...or at least most of it. All I have to say is HAPPY PILLS dude...HAPPY PILLS for those who want to be FREAKISHLY HAPPY...n not high lol. That won't cut it. Amber, thanx for the gross-out story of the week w/ ur cousins n their bike crashes. Much needed info there. lol So...My Godspell song is gonna b hott. lol...Well now...I'm at a loss for words...what a sad, sad day...hour...w/e

      My mother decided to bring up Fathers Day, like, what I was plannin on doin w/ him. And truthfully, I don't know my father anymore. Just a stranger or more like a friend who calls on the phone every night. And not even a best friend at that. Get this. He even accused my mom of using me. She's just been peacemaker between me n my father. If it was my choice, he wouldn't have been at my honors convocation. He wouldn't have been at my choir banquet. But now my mom has told me she won't interfere and try to get me to do things with him *yay*. But still, if anyone is using me, it's him. I'm the comeback for him. It sucks. When I mentioned my Fathers Day gift @ the party, ppl were like that's just harsh. All I had to say was if you only knew. If they only knew the hells I've been through because I come from a broken home and I have a father who is an ass. So that's why "Emotionless" by Good Charlotte is fitting. Not to mention that my emotions ARE whacked. I'm better off with just my mom even though that's kinda hard sometimes. We argue constantly, but everyone pretty much knows that. We do have our good times though. Example: My mom and me raided Garden Ridge yesterday and we had a hell of a time with this red fuzzy lamp shade that made an excellent hat. She was freakishly *gulp* like a goofy friend. But the next second we were arguing about something...go figure lol. I gave both my parents warning that once I start driving, I'm not gonna b around much to listen to their crap. Not that my dad would know or care. He's at his apartment or at the homewrecker's even though the homewrecker is really Jeremy or Walgreens. *lame excuses papa. even i could do better.* And I also warned them that after high school, I'm gonna move out ASAP for "college purposes." I can only hope it's somewhere at least 5 hours away. I'm tired of bitchin to the world...I'm out for now...

      So yea, I'm officially obsessed with Godspell. Good music there. O YEA! lol I can't believe I forgot what I was gonna post here...grrr...this isn't fair. O yea. My family is crazy. My mom and my aunt had an argument over baskets that are being made for a raffle/fundraiser. Get this...it's in OCTOBER. And they're already fussing bout it. We were @ Casa G for my satanic cousin's b-day. *If he passes 8th grade, he'll be a stupid freshman when I'm a junior! HAHAHA!!!! He's so goin down* I laughed so hard when the ppl came singin to him. good times good times. O yes. HAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW! HHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW! don't ask me, ask Betsy or Maddy. h/o... ok. I had to get up and do the old dude dance from the Six Flags commercial. It's like mine n Betsy's tradition now. It's good exercise too. SO GET UP N F-IN DANCE ALREADY! GRRRRRRRRRR! hehe. jk y'allz. Dude...I found out that after I left the party, they played team air hockey again n played hide-n-go-seek. I was kinda disappointed I wasn't included. Then again, only a few ppl were left in the end. *obviously* I'm gonna have my own party on the only possible weekend I can! SECOND WEEKEND IN JULY! *I still have to get approval from the mama* Well, since I've had nothing to eat like almost all day n since I'm tryin to finish this song I wrote *it's hott*, I'll c y'allz tomorrow.

      Ok yea...my blog REALLY doesn't like me. I just noticed that it posted the same thing three times and when I tried to post a second ago, it like spazzed so I had to log out. *sighs* I got some lovely news from Bobby the other day. Supposedly, Tim is now a DAD. Ya kno, Tim who was like ObSeSsEd n StAlKeRy after the talent show. But yea, a chick that he was with ended up pregnant n she just had the kid n they don't kno if the kid is his. Sorry, but that's just way too young and sooooo disgusting. Thank God I turned him down even though it was for Brad. But at least I wouldn't have to worry about being used for sex. Not that it would have happened...he would've gotten b**** slapped. FO SHO! lol. Not that I WASN'T used, but hey, maybe it wasn't B's intent. Who knows anymore. Guys can be so stupid. Anywho, I need to call Loren later *the director for Godspell*. He called earlier just out of nowhere to give me audition information, and I was going to answer but my phone doesn't like me either and died. I have decided I am loved by Loren and the rest of the Curtains Up group *like duh...jk, jk* I mean, I was freakin MARY in their Christmas show for Christ's sake...no pun intended lol. I'm out.

      so yea...the party... I didn't have to crash it! I went w/ Betsy, Maddy, n Leslie. When we got there I was like dude...this house is niiiiiice. I like avoided eye contact and any possible contact w/ Brad when we first got there. But the four of us made Brad's gift. It was hott. I took a pic. Newho, we made a t-shirt that said: Happy Birthday, Mighty Lord of the Dinos, Princess Brad. We made him a crown *my head was used to model it lol* that said Princess Brad and it had dinosaurs in the background *hence lord of the dinos* and we made a 'magical' sceptor, a cape, and a necklace. Our gift was the greatest, that's all there is to it. So yea, we explained that I was Betsy's date, he gave us one of those 'OMG, ur f-in CRAZY' looks and it was all good after that. Cept for when we were attacked by water guns and water balloons. Maddy, Betsy, n I wore white shirts...go figure something like that would happen. The party continued. We stole a bowl of chips, ate cake *it was delicious*We played air hockey w/ teams. Brad volunteered to be on my team and then he scratched my hand so I have a one-two inch gash on my hand that really stings. He gave me a hug after that, and he gave me a hug for another reason but I don't remember what it was. It was weird. *shrugs* Then me n Trevor played air hockey, went for the puck at the same time, it flew up, hit the ceiling, and a piece of the ceiling chipped. I was like silent and in shock at first. Then we spazzed and I was like dude, that was the greatest thing EVER. We embraced for our deed of the day and literally left a mark. We then all played cards...I kicked for a while, but then I did TERRIBLE at speed mainly because Brad cheated *scoffs* he is such a girl...all whiny n crap...he's always pms-in bout something...lol jk, jk. that's me. And no cheating, my A.D.D. kicked in and I was talkin to about 5 other people while playing. O yea, and we watched The Exorcist...I laughed so hard. I couldn't help it. I think that movie's funny. I guess it was more fun than I thought it would be. It was boring in the beginning, and people were confused as to why I wasn't invited but proud of me for rebelling against the system and showing up anyway. It was decided that I was supposed to be invited but Brad was kind of in denial. I guess that was the whole party...I'm prolly missing some more hilarious stuff but I'm like dead. The moral of today *or yesterday, since it's 12 somethin*: People should sneak into other people's parties more often!  ps. Tasha, when's the riot? Or is it cancelled again?

      I think I've officially become an insomniac. I was so wired last nite. Anywho! Chicago trip in 12 days!! YAY! I can't wait! It's gonna b wicked boring but Aaron's makin his triumphant return so it won't b as crappy as I thought it would b. Maybe crappier...but I doubt that lol. I have decided to make another "Out of Order" sign to put on the bathroom door even though a little kid will think we're serious, complain to their mommy or a person in charge and I will be corrected in front of my peers. But it will end in a good laugh. It'll be the adult's fault if the bus smells in the back. That's all I have to say about that. And Matt's not gonna be there so NO NOOSES! *score* I just found out that my "Messenger" Tim is gonna be a stupid Freshman. Good luck buddy. It's gonna be hell...jk, jk! He'll be my favorite freshie even though he's goin to Mater Dei *s/c* and I guess his parents think he's too good for Highland High even though that place KICKS! Cuz Tasha goes there. So does Dave, but yet again, another story. Well I'm still getting ready soo i'll bbl!

Well...not really, but I didn't wanna go to it lol. I'm tannerish lol. So that gets cool points. Yesterday, Karen was like super evil n my mom was like why do you put up with that? I said I don't know anymore...go figure...h/o, must fetch my taquitos!...AH yummy.  Amber, what time are you goin to registration? Cuz I don't want to go alone n I'm tryin to figure out what time Mandy's goin too...Get back to me on that...  Lessons learned today: Jamie Cullum is the GREATEST.

      eh...I had to get up at 4 so I could go to Today in St. Louis. It's like&nbsp;8 AM...I must&nbsp;be lonely. Anywho, it was fun for a while. I did my&nbsp;Tour Guide Barbie thing, and I did it well. So yea, that Art dude&nbsp;on channel 5 is freakin tall. I was like&nbsp;wow.&nbsp;And the Scott dude was cool. He was talkin to us bout&nbsp;how he slept through his alarm that morning and that he gets up at 2 AM.&nbsp;I was like I admire you're...earliness. And he talked to us bout how he was in drama n chorus or maybe it was just drama in&nbsp;hs.&nbsp;He's a cool kid. Anywho, leaving,&nbsp;there were these&nbsp;little girls in the van on our way back from STL who WOULDN'T SHUT UP. I swear...they must be morning ppl cuz they were wired. If their mom wasn't the one driving I was gonna yell "Shut the F up or else I'm gonna tape your mouths shut w/ duct tape that I don't have! GRRR!" Knowing them, they'd keep goin n I would have to go to some extremity...*sigh* I'm goin back to bed...

      Yea...I never died.&nbsp;Then again,&nbsp;normal sleeping habits + rehearsal - social life = The DEATH of the once known AMYNESS. So maybe in a way I did die. Whatever. I decided that my dad can be an ok guy. He's just incapable of being a family man. I don't see him as a father anymore, just as like that goofy uncle. That's slightly depressing, but I've never really had a goofy uncle, so I'd like to think that the good sides of my dad would be that kind of figure. Anyway. Show Me St. Louis kicked ass. On our way over there,&nbsp;Mike followed the whole way. It was me, Alicia, and Abbye in the car *FYI, Did you know that Alicia is Mrs. Laswell's daughter? DUN DUN DUN! We all actually get along. I've seen the good side of Sharon. Scarrrrry?? lol* Anywho, we were waving to him on the highway and whatnot. And we were like, Let's give him the loser sign! So we did and he gave us the finger. That was kinda funny since he's Jesus. So we keep truckin, he tries to pass us, but my dad sped up. He gave us a look of anger/despair. We also caught him jammin to whatever was on the radio. He pulled up next to us in STL. I tried to blast Bohemian Rhapsody, but we were too late *damn the luck* We found an ice cream stand thing so the 4 of us waltzed over to the window w/ our melting ice cream at hand, jealousy written all over the others' faces. Even the little Wizard of Oz kids who stole the show from us. So it was fun. When the WOO ppl sang, we started a chorus of Day by Day to drown them out. It worked wonderfully...temporarily lol. During commercial breaks we jammed and made fun of the WOO ppl. I felt like Tour Guide Barbie. I might have looked perky on TV but once the cameras were off, I looked like I was pissed off at someone/something. So the show was over, and we went off on our merry way. We followed Mike and his partner in crime Chase to the crosswalk and I told Mike that he was going to hell for giving us an obscene finger gesture. Across from his truck he yelled O NO! They better not have given me a ticket! Sho nuff, there on his windshield was a ticket for not parking right or something even though he was parked the same as the surrounding vehicles. That was freakin hilarious! Loren told him to take it up w/ his Father. Haha, get it? He's Jesus? God? hehe...soooo. Other than that, nmh. Just rehearsal after rehearsal after rehearsal. If you wanna, get up at about...eh, 6 AM ish and turn on Channel 5 for Today in St. Louis and you can see either "I Just Woke Up, So&nbsp;Get&nbsp;the Hell Away From Me&nbsp;Amy" or "Insomniac Amy" not sure which one is gonna make an appearance. Either way, it'll be kinda funny to see me awake in the AM...btw...It's 9 something AM...I must be lonely...Later

      No more pictures to remind me What you did was wrong. You stole her heart and ran away. She thought it wouldn't be long.  But now the halls and walls are bare Reeking your memory. Lone nails stick out in place. Hoping to never be lonely.  I feel like the nails, sitting there so. No worries to fill my brain. I burrow into my hole of hardness, Stuck in a rut again.  Your pleas don't make me flinch I stopped listening long ago. For when you left the last time, You left without your soul.

      So yea...Rehearsal was freakin hilarious...Emily sings "Turn Back O Man" and she gets to "sex up" Jesus *aka Jeez-ass* While she was singing her song, NKLP walked right in front of her n she just about died. The rest of us on stage just looked at each other like OMG what is she gonna do? So while he was setting up, Emily went behind him during her little improv part and was like HELLLOOOO! And we all just about died. Even the Bitch on Wheels was dying. Ryan had no clue that Emily made a move on him. He still doesn't know. Anyway, we had like a tiny convo w/ him. He has pretty eyes n he smells pretty...He even has a pretty voice lol. So yea...good times. Emily and I also snuck on stage for several scenes that we weren't supposed to be in. They didn't notice *yayness*. So we're movin on up. And I'm in like all of the second act. *major yayness* While singing backstage, Mike was talkin to us n he was like "U just got served!" n he started to do some dance moves so we we were like Break it down Jesus! Back that Jeez-ass up. Shake that Jeez-ass, Jeez-ass! So Emily is making Jeez-ass buttons for us. It's gonna have Mike's pic on it and we're gonna wear em on our asses...MAJOR good times....w/ Jeez-ass...hehe SEE! This is why everyone should be involved in theater!

      Seriously, you need to freakin get off your butt and listen to this song!  We don’t even talk anymore And we don’t even know what we argue about Don’t even say I love you no more ’cause saying how we feel is no longer allowed Some people will work things out And some just don’t know how to change  Chorus:Let’s don’t wait till the water runs dry We might watch our whole lives pass us by Let’s don’t wait till the water runs dry We’ll make the biggest mistake of our lives Don’t do it baby  Now they can see the tears in our eyes But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts Well maybe that’s a pain we can’t hide ’cause everybody knows that we’re both torn apart Why do we hurt each other Why do we push love away  Chorus  Some people will work things out And some just don’t know how to change  Chorus

      This is my comment towards Jdawg's post on cheating, divorce, etc. I'm just too lazy to put it on his blog...  Ditto to Tasha's comment *YAY! *golf clap**, but coming from the broken family point of view, I would have to disagree with certain things. I know it's wrong to cheat, blah blah blah, but I'm talking about the "If you're considering a divorce, reconsider. Think of your children, think of your families' lives after divorce." comment. Sometimes a divorce can be a good thing. Maybe not in the eyes of God or your peers. That just sounded terrible and is not helping my point...Maybe, just maybe, a divorce might be the answer to make one happy. I speak as the child affected. I am happier since my parents' separation. It may not seem like it, but I am. And that might make me a selfish, hypocritical brat, but I have feelings and opinions too. Why live in misery? So maybe I can't help society right now, but in the future, I'll consider it...  Okay, I know that I might have had a slight change in heart, but you know, coming back home for my dad would almost be like offering a robber everything you own. I can't think of a better analogy, so that'll do for now. All I have to say is my dad ruins everything eventually. I can't trust. I know he's trying to change for the better, but there's that part of me that doubts.  My mother asked me, "So, if your husband cheated on you, you would say it's over? Just like that?" and I responded, "Yes. Because no human being deserves to be treated like that. Letting him back would be something that he wants once again, and you're handing it over on a silver platter." I don't remember if I said it exactly like that, but that was what I was aiming for at the time.  There, I was redundant, but I don't really care. I got my point across...

We've never done that much damn work. I hate Karen! I think Kathy *costume coordinator* was pissed at her earlier. They were going to have a talk after rehearsal...BUUUURN! lol. Anywho, I just thought the world should know that I'm close to death. Come to my funeral. It'll be hott.

      Soooo yea. At rehearsal, the NKLP aka Hottie Hott made an appearance. Most of us looked like crap and were constantly looking down the hallway for him. He showed up every once in a while. Emily and I weren't drawing attention to ourselves by twirling like our goofy selves. He was just drawn to our presense lol. Wow he's hott. And then Abbye told me that he hates Karen, our choreographer/assistant director who wishes she ruled the world cuz EVERYTHING'S ABOUT HER!!! ick. Ryan referred to Karen as the Bitch on Wheels. It was HILARIOUS! And it made him even hotter lol. So we made up our own code for when she's pissin us off w/ the help of Hottie Hott. SoOoOoOo...he's gonna b there on FRIDAY. Not THURSDAY. Until then, u should check out Betsy's car, Chingada Suave. It's awesome lol.

      I forgot that Godspell is based on the book of Matthew. So yea, here's my song...  You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it give light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Matthew 5: 13-16  I thought that was freakin wicked awesome lol.

      Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. Matthew 18: 21-22  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admoniting one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. Colossians 3:15-17

      Friday night was interesting. I borrowed a Blockbuster video from my dad. It was 1776, a musical. I thought it was weird that he would rent a musical, but I didn't really care. Well, the fam's been talkin bout him coming home again. I think it's crap...w/e. And then I finally decide to watch the movie b4 we gotta take it back. I open it and TADA! A receipt. But my father's name isn't on the receipt. Oh no, it's Kate's. So I woke my mom up and told her. I reminded her that I'm always right, that Dad won't change. So I called him at like midnight and we had a onesided conversation. I did all the talking. So we decided to have a talk Saturday afternoon. I ended up not getting sleep because my schedule's screwed up. So my mom and I went out to Belleville...it was madness...we ended up going to a flea market thing. It was hella nifty, but my left leg like died on me so I couldn't walk that well. I decided to call myself Gimpy. I got some old records to decorate my room w/. Got some KC and the Sunshine Band, Commodores, and like 3 more. It's nifty. I need to go to those things more often. Then we went to this antique store because they were having a sale on old movie posters. They were all crap. We wasted a good five minutes looking at those damn things. So since I was literally dying from hunger, lack of sleep, and a leg that didn't work, we went home. Padre came over at like noon. I don't remember a lot of the conversation because I was pretty much out of it. I do remember telling him that when I look at him I see a stranger. I see a godless man. And I know that I told him that he doesn't have faith and that it shows. If he was a man of God, he wouldn't do half the things he does. And I told him that I want to sit down and have a talk with Kate. I tried to find a nicer word than "homewrecker", but it wasn't coming in my fatigue. The stories ended up getting repeated and that pissed me off so I yelled at them that I was going upstairs because I didn't care. And during my yelling, Dad was like AMY! And I retorted an annoyed WHAT?! And he stood up and came over to me, hugged me and said I just wanted to say I love you. I was in like semi-shock. I didn't know what to say so I marched upstairs, went to my bed, and cried out of confusion. I then looked at some pictures and that cheered me up. I fell asleep to I Love the 90s repeats. Go figure. And I slept from about 2 something til 1 something. Be proud. I caught up on some sleep, but I'm like still blah. Modest Mouse was on VH1 AND MTV at the same time. That was wacky. And now Badly Drawn Boy's Year of the Rat is on MTV. I don't get that song...w/e..I'm gonna go because I think my mom stirred...

      Yes, I am a hypocrite. It is sad, I know. But I admitted that everyone needs forgiveness. I'm trying to find that Bible passage that talks bout it...O well, the search continues. Anywho, I believe everyone needs to be forgiven to an extent. Lines must be drawn though. Emotional abuse isn't necessarily forgive and forget. It lingers. Which is why I think my mother needs a wake-up call. It's not gonna work between her and my father. She has everything written up, ready to go to the lawyer, but she's all talk. Kinda like me. I have corrupted my parents. Not the other way around. I became my own person, and ruined my parents' goodness. Maybe it WAS for the better *shrugs*.  I Love the 90s 1998 made me realize there's no love for the furby because they don't shut up. I guess it's a good thing I didn't have one or else I mighta been more evil and abusive because I would've tried to kill the furby.  At my party, as we all know, we danced in the rain. Since me n Tasha are only happy when it rains *w/a song btw*, we shoulda made a rain dance n if everyone at the party would go outside at the same time n do the rain dance, it'll magically rain. And that would kick ass.

      I decided to come up w/ another title for my future album. It's nicknamed Secret option number three because I like to have secret options since the Chicago trip. And because I can lol.  Secret option number three is... Random Thoughts of the Idle Mind.  I don't know if that rings a bell w/ neone out there, but it was the title of my young authors thing in 8th grade. I didn't get a prize or anything. Maybe I was too truthful. Hell, my dad even made me censor some things because he didn't believe ppl should know what happens behind the scenes of our family...so much for the censorship now... ................................................................. Dudes...Ginger, my dog, kicks ass. She like follows me everywhere when my mom leaves for work. It's like you can tell her to go away *why would you want her to leave you?!* and she won't. Maybe it's out of stoopudity, but I'd like to think it's because of love.

      I've been wanting to post this for a while. I finally remembered..YAY  "All my life I had been looking for something, and everywhere I turned someone tired to tell me what it was. I accepted their answers too, though they were often in contradiction and even self-contradictory. I was naïve. I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself."  --Ralph Ellison's  Invisible Man

      Maybe there is, but people don't like to post a comment. It's ok. Thank you Tasha for trying to get people interested in my sometimes idiotic thoughts. Usually they're heartfelt, but I don't think a lot of people notice the sincerity. It's ok. I don't think people are meant to understand me. Maybe it's because of the fact that I don't want them to understand me. If everyone understood me, I would be dead. I would no longer bring madness, surprise, excitement, mystery to life, because it would just be suspected. I wouldn't be able to rebel because I wouldn't be taken seriously or people would be like it's about time. I would be Jane Doe. Miss Average. Just like the rest of the world. The rest of Pop Culture which should burn in hell. So until next time, don't try to figure me totally out. Don't take me seriously all the time, but you gotta recognize the times you need to.

      I wrote the entire song, music included, in like two hours. And it's not too crappy lol...w/e. You can judge that...I'm also trying to decide which should be my album title.  WISH YOU WERE -OR- ANTI-VALENTINE  post opinions...  "Positive Thinking"  --Intro thingy:-- Something inside/Is holding you back. You just can't shine,/But I care. I'll be there all the way.  --Chorus-- Try to have strength./Try to have faith. Try to carry on./It'll be okay in the end. Don't be afraid./Don't hide your face. Don't want you to cry anymore. Just hold your breath./Take it in. Someday you'll win./Never fade away.  --We'll just call this a verse-- Just say a prayer./Call His name. It's there for the taking./Be welcoming. It's hard, I know/To have positive thinking. But it's okay./We can dare to dream. We will succeed./Never worry. Thank my Lord.  --Chorus x2--  Try to have strength./Try to have faith. Try to carry on./It'll be okay in the end.

       "Ordinary" - Train *kick ass song, man*   Whose eyes am I behind I don’t recognize anything that I see Whose skin is this design I don’t want this to be the way that you see me  I don’t understand anything anymore In this world that I’m tired of Is taking me right up these walls That I climb up  To get to your story It’s anything but ordinary  And when the world is on its knees with me its fine And when I come to the rescue I get nothing but left behind Everybody seems to be getting what they need, where's mine ‘Cause your what I need so very but im anything but ordinary  Can you save me from this world of mine Before I get myself arrested with this expectation You are the one look what you’ve done What have you done?  This is not some kind of joke You’re just a kid You weren’t ready for what you did  And when the world is on its knees with me its fine And when I come to the rescue I do it for you time after time Everybody seems to be getting what they need, where's mine ‘Cause you what I need so very but im anything but ordinary  I think im trying to save the world for you You’ve been saving me too We could just stay in and save each other  Im anything but ordinary  (ordinary) Im anything but ordinary  (ordinary)   "Vindicated" - Dashboard Confessional *for Tasha*   Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  (Chorus) I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  (Chorus)  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current and let me slip away  (Chorus)  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...   And of course, it wouldn't be complete without the theme...   Can he swing from a thread Take a look over head Hey there There goes the Spider-man  In the chill of night At the scene of a crime Like a stream of light He arrives just in time  Spider-man, Spider-man Friendly neighborhood Spider-man Welcome him, he's ignored Action is his reward To him, life is a great big bang-up Wherever there's a hang-up You'll find the Spider-man

      I can't sing about love I can't find, I can't write you a happy tune. For all we know, you may be blind Since you can't notice I'm hiding from you.  I wish my skies could be bluer, But all I see is gray. My lasting days become fewer, Though my dreams want me to stay.  I wish I didn't have to struggle To make you understand. You don't listen when I'm in trouble, When I need a helping hand.  They think I'm real with this "happiness." They refuse to see me bitter. I'm morphed, molded, and helpless. They don't see that I am a quitter.  I just wish that everyone didn't judge By the smile forced on my face. The emptiness won't seem to budge. I'm unraveling like ripped lace.  Since people can't change me for better, And my words are set in stone. I'm teaching the world the word "never" Because I'm always alone.

      I found out through Bobby that Mitch's sister was in the car accident on Saturday that was on Interstate 55-70 or w/e...there was a wake for her earlier today and the funeral is tomorrow. So if you have time, pray for the affected families and for Sarah. Now, it's weird because he wasn't mentioned in the obituary, but his other sister Samantha is...so I'm confused man...but oh well. I guess that's all I have to say about that. I am at a loss for words and just in shock since we're like tight...like margerine. Note to self: Call on Thursday. GIVE IT A FEW DAYS

So why don't you be my Anti-Valentine?  And then there was darkness  Because you swang or swung. And your parents disowned you 'Cause you were on that VH1 shoooooow About swingas.  You stupid swinga, I should hit ya  'Cause there's no looooooove, No looooooove, No loooooooove. So why don't you be my Anti-Valentine?

This is for my parents and to piss Amber off because she doesn't like Maroon 5...I still love u, cracker!   "Not Coming Home"  When you refuse me You confuse me What makes you think I'll let you in again Think again my friend Go on misuse me and abuse me I'll come out stronger in the end  And does it make you sad To find yourself alone And does it make you mad To find that I have grown I'll bet it hurts so bad To see the strength that I have shown  When you answer the door pick up the phone You wont find me cause I'm not coming home  You do not know how much this hurts me To say these things that I don't want to say But have to say them anyway I would do anything to end your suffering But you would rather walk away  And does it make you sad To find yourself alone And does it make you mad To find that I have grown I'll bet it hurts so bad To see the strength that I have shown  When you answer the door pick up the phone You wont find me cause I'M NOT COMING HOME

      She says it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat  She's always worried about things like that  She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault  And she only sleeps when it's raining  And she screams and her voice is straining   [chorus]  She says baby  It's 3 am I must be lonely  When she says baby  Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes  Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it   She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing  And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all  She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to  And she only sleeps when it's raining  And she screams and her voice is straining   [chorus]  She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to  And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days  She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway  But outside it's stopped raining   [chorus]

      So yea, Saturday started out all...crazy. I had three hours of sleep and then had to work a three hour shift @ the exec. board's car wash. It was HELL. Once I got home I like crashed...literally. Then 4:30 rolled around, I chased my dad away from here so it wouldn't b all awkwardy...He liked my pictures hehe...And then ppl started coming...Tasha was like the first one...Playing in the rain was soooo much fun dudes...wow...I have a bruise on my knee and I got blisters bcuz of our walk to Dairy Queen *my mom was like grr for about 2 minutes lol*...those flip flops don't like me man...But I think I had too much sugar and other junk. I felt like I was gonna get sick...Zero sleep didn't help either. I was quite content w/ the CHIPPER-ness. And the watermelon story. Tasha, did you hug Jdawg for me? Maybe I should check your blog lol...w/e. Since y'allz know what all happened, all I have to say is: nailpolish highness=scorage, and it's 12 AM...I must be lonely now...

      So yea...Maddy *my other half in drama* n me were just talkin bout drama n the plays this year. They were so much fun! I-Man was so hella boring though. And I think it was worse for the cast because we had to sit there while our asses became numb. Red House was funner. I even got to be part of the crew. That was exciting lol. AND Maddy's gonna protest to Loren *director of Godspell* tellin him that I deserved a better role lol. And we also decided that I should sign up for student director for the fall play FO SHO. Cuz then I can b like Brad! I can't hear a damn word your saying and give stage! lol her words, not mine. But I like the direction in which she's going. O! And I need an opinion. What would be the better musical for CHS to perform? West Side Story or Grease? I prefer Grease mainly because it's more popular and seems like more fun, and I've never seen a blonde Maria. And another thing, me n Brad are the only drama singers, so we'll purdy much get the leads in w/e musical they do. I guess that's a plus. Leads are hella fun. Little parts aren't as fun, but I was just reminded of the number one rule/law thing in community theater: There are no small roles, only small people. I hafta continue to remind myself bout that...It's hard since I can b a ham. ARG.  I thought of something fun...I'm gonna try to sing the National Anthem for the football games. I'm gonna find out where I can sign up or w/e. Well, our football sucks, but i don't really care. It would get me outta the house. And then I can freeze my ass off in 40 or 50 degree weather like at homecoming. We only scored 7 points compared to the other team's 40 something score. Maybe soccer would b a better route...HmMmMmMmM...

      Hey all...we're having technical difficulties w/ Godspell...Tasha, some of this will b a repeat for ya...We lost soloists, Judas, and our pianist. The positions have been refilled by other cast members and Judas is our assistant director, Cole *yay*. All except for the pianist. If you know of anyone that would be interested in the position, TELL ME!! We can hang out lol..You won't be alone!  Yeah...I've been inspired by the title...it's also inspired by the thezzy *drama* boyz...i also heard it on the radio earlier...anyway here goes lol  "Piano Man"  It's nine o'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin  He says, "Son can you play me a memory I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad and it's sweet And I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes"  Sing us a song you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke But there's someplace that he'd rather be  He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me" As a smile ran away from his face "Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place"  Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy And probably will be for life  And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinking alone  Sing us a song you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile 'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see To forget about life for a while  And the piano sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say "Man what are you doing here?"  Sing us a song you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright

      Oh yea, I don't think I blogged about my Independence Day adventures. Betsy, Stephanie, n me became UBER PYROS. Brittany was there too bcuz of Max. She didn't join in our pyroness surprisingly...Betsy's n Max's neice Samantha was trying to beat Max up. It was the funniest thing ever. He held her legs and arms and she tried to head-butt him. lol. I shoulda gotten a picture of it. Wow, she was hyper as hell...I think those were the only highlights of the night really. But Friday, I might be going to Betsy's to shoot off more fireworks w/ her n Steph.  So yea..I'm gonna b busy for the next week if I can get everything together...I have rehearsals tonight and next Tuesday-Thursday, the party on Saturday-Sunday, and I MIGHT be going over to Betsy's Friday, Tasha's on Sunday-Monday, n Mandy's Tuesday-Wednesday...OMG...how the hell am I going to do this?! HELP ME PLZ! I need to stop planning a kabillion things at once...But I can't really help it dudes...  I'm gonna put Jdawg's comment thing on my blog cuz I thought it was freakin hilarious: I'm going to make a point now, and comically at that: It's not important about whether or not people's lives are worse than yours, its about how your problem effects you. Say some kid loses a watermelon. Lets say this kid was very attached to his pet watermelon. He is soooo sad that he's lost his best friend. Then, he discovers his dad ATE HIS WATERMELON! HE ATE HIS BEST FRIEND!!! This character, whom we will call timmy, is absolutely traumatized by this turn of events. He cant sleep etc.  Now while timmy is probably the age of 5 or something, the important thing is that this is a big deal to him. I could be affecting him just as much emotionally as somebody that just lost a dog or a friend. Please be aware I am NOT saying you're 5 or anything. Anyway, I hope that helped. Now, lets have a moment of silence for timmy's watermelon...  it was supposed to make a point...o well lol

It starts like this...ahem...Once upon a time there was a fish named squishy and he swam and swam, well, he just kept swimming...the end. *silence* ok, so that's crap...I don't care.  I'm thinkin of taking up directing. For the fall play, I'm gonna sign up for student director. That way, I can have a say in everything. And if I were student director for Our Town, that would majorly be an honor cuz that's his last play and I would be his last student director. Wow. lol. But for now, I'm quite content. GO THESPIS! Speaking of directing, one day I would love to make a non-crappy version of Lord of the Flies. Of course, I haven't seen the original so I might rent it...hm...But yea, the ending is gonna be hott. The last images you see are a tear rolling down Ralph's cheek and then falling. The camera "follows" the tear that is reflecting the flames of the burning forest...and then there's an uber close up of the flames and it goes to darkness...it's my vision, and I'll stick w/ it lol. It's dramatic, it's moving, the public will love it. I could even write the script. That would be fun. Anyone wanna help? We will make Lord of the Flies loved by EVERYONE. Cuz not everyone likes the thought of kids going crazy and the darkness of man's soul. The loss of innocence. Piggy, you rock my socks dude. I don't wanna give anything away to those who read this Blog which is like 2 ppl...but I dunno if you *Tasha* have read it. If not, I'll get it for you for your birthday in a month and 8 days. *YAY!* You can pick me up and then we'll go partying! lol I doubt that this is about 800 characters long and that kinda upsets me...  I have this song stuck in my head, I'm kindly sharing it w/ ya!  "We Beseech Thee"  Father, hear thy children's call  Humbly at thy feet we fall  Prodigals confessing all  We beseech thee, hear us!   We thy call have disobeyed  Into paths of sin have strayed  And repentence have delayed  We beseech thee, hear us!   Come sing about Love!  That made us first to be  Come sing about Love!  That made the stone and tree  Come sing about Love!  That draws us lovingly  We beseech thee, hear us!   -Sick!-We come come to thee for cure  -Guilty!-We seek thy mercy sure  -Evil!-We long to be made pure  We beseech thee, hear us!   -Blind!-We pray that we may see  -Bound!-We pray to be made free  -Stained!-We pray for sanctity  We beseech thee, hear us!   Come sing about Love!-Love!- That made us first to be  Come sing about Love!-Love!- That made the stone and tree  Come sing about Love!  Love! Love! Love! That draws us lovingly We beseech thee, hear us!  By the gracious saving call  Spoken tenderly to all  Who have shared man's guilt and fall  We beseech thee, hear us!   By the love that longs to bless  Pitying our sore distress  Leading us to holiness  We beseech thee, hear us!   Grant us all from earth to rise  And to strain with eager eyes  Towards the promised Heavenly prize  We beseech thee, hear us!   Come sing about Love!-Love!-  That made us first to be  Come sing about Love!-Love!-  That made the stone and tree  Come sing about Love! Love! Love! Love! Love!  That draws us lovingly  We beseech thee, hear us!  it's so catchy...dontcha think?

      The voices in my head are telling me to eat ice cream...they're quite nice actually. One is Bob and the other is Aloicious *Al-owe-ish-us*...Aloicious is awesome...he's the dumb one...we're tight like margerine. One day the world will meet him and he will be loved. His nickname is Squishy, btw. Enough about that...I'm gonna discuss the convo Am-beer n I are having. Jesus DID have half-brothers and sisters because it's like impossible for Mary to have been a virgin all her life. *sigh* yea...that was the highlight of the convo..i don't need to go into detail... Godspell isn't as bad...there's 55 in the cast now...and I think they're continually dropping. Our Judas *Tony* might drop out. He's not happy w/ the Curtain's Up ppl and he didn't really wanna b in it...he's in a Muny show so that's more important than crappy community theater...I don't blame him. O yea, Tasha, I asked if he knew u n he was like 'the last name doesn't ring a bell' SoOoOoO...lol. I tried. He stepped on me when we were working on "Day by Day". I almost lost a flip flop. Some of the scariest two seconds of my life. I'm still stuck w/ one line. There's this one kid who has like a billion and I'm slightly offended. Okay, so it's more like ten. But that's nine more than most of us. GRRRR. I can't drop out because I feel obligated now. And a couple more ppl I know finally showed up to rehearsals, so maybe it won't b that bad. Maybe it's all for the best...someone has to be opressed...YES! it's all for the best! lol...if you've never seen Godspell or it's kinda foggy, you wouldn't understand that. OMG! I watched Meet the Parents the other day and when they ask Ben Stiller to say grace, he recites the lyrics to Day by Day..I never realized it...That is like the most brilliant thing in the world. Since I'm now obsessed w/ this show, and I dunno if anyone truly relates w/ me, I'll shut up about it now... :)

      okay...yea...insomnia's kicking in again...I have like a billion trivial things going through my head at once and It's sad that right now, I'm watching the Brady Bunch. I HATE the Brady Bunch. But of course I hafta b extremely lazy and not change the channel. So I'm stuck watching this lame 70's show that I haven't watched since I was like ten...*changes channel* YAY for MTV's All Things Rock...Switchfoot's on and my mom is yelling at me to get off the computer...*sighs* I'm definitely out this time...

      Dudes...I went to Mills earlier like when it wasn't raining. I got the awesome-est clothes...It's just hard to believe I got a shirt from American Eagle and an awesome outfit from Aeropostale. WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO?! I have a good excuse tho...the AE shirt was all about the rock and I paid 5.25 for it lol. And the Aero outfit was like fate...my mom and I actually agreed on the awesomeness of it. Since that never happens, I had to get it. *sighs* I also got books. Lord of the Flies and The Once and Future King...I hafta read that during the school year. It's about King Arthur n Merlin n all that good stuff, and since I like that shit, I'm kinda lookin forward to it. NOW to read my required summer books...that's a toughy. And my mom rudely reminded me I have less than 2 months to finish them and write the hella long report on them. Thanx mom *salutes*   SOOOO the sirens went off...I was thinkin that I'm only happy when it rains and then when I checked out Tasha's hott blog, that song was there...Our great minds must always be at work or something lol.  Continuing with the summer madness, I'm having a party @ the crib yo. If you are Amber, Tasha, Angie, Nifer, Sarah, Mandy, or Brittany, you are invited. If you wanna come crash it, go ahead. If you think you shoulda been invited, e-mail me or gimme a call, I'll sneak you in. Depending on who you are, you get a wink wink. lol So yeah..Saturday @ 7 to Sunday @ noon. Then you gotta get your ass out and move on with your life. We will have pizza AND ice cream. We can even work on our pyro skills lol...  Dudes...I'm tired...it's still thundering and raining and w/e...I'm gonna go...much luv

      "I Will Carry You"  Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason The thought of breathing only takes my breath away I’ve spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling Do I have the strength to make it through the day But I was never meant To walk this road alone I can always trust you When you say  I will carry you Be your strength And pull you through Reach for me And take my hand We will pray And we will stand In a world Crying out for peace Let your heart be strong For when I am weak You will carry me  Sometimes you wonder if the road you’re on has a reason It’s hard to go on when you just don’t know We can shoulder all the weight of life between us Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone ’cause we were never meant To walk this road alone We are bound together When we say...  I will carry you Be your strength And pull you through Reach for me And take my hand We will pray And we will stand In a world Crying out for peace Let your heart be strong For when I am weak You will carry me   "Friends"  Packing up the dreams God planted In the fertile soil of you Can’t believe the hopes he’s granted Means a chapter in your life is through But we’ll keep you close as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone ’cause our hearts in big and small ways Will keep the love that keeps us strong  Chorus: And friends are friends forever If the lord’s the lord of them And a friend will not say never ’cause the welcome will not end Though it’s hard to let you go In the father’s hands we know That a lifetime’s not too long to live as friends.  With the faith and love god’s given Springing from the hope we know We will pray the joy you’ll live in Is the strength that now you show But we’ll keep you close as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone ’cause our hearts in big and small ways Will keep the love that keeps us strong  Chorus   "I Will Be Here"  When you feel the sunlight Fade into the cold night Don’t know where to turn I don’t know where to turn And all the dreams you’re dreaming Seem to lose their meaning Let me in your world Baby, let me in your world All you need is someone you can hold Don’t be sad, you’re not alone  Chorus: I will be here for you Somewhere in the night Somewhere in the night I’ll shine a light for you Somewhere in the night I’ll be standing by I will be here for you  In this world of strangers Of cold unfriendly faces Someone you can trust Oh there’s someone you can trust I will be your shelter I’ll give you my shoulder Just reach out for my love Reach out for my love Call my name and my heart will hear I will be there, there’s nothing to fear  Chorus

      As I was reading your blog, I thought of something...I should make a dedication post for ya!  Once upon a time I transfered to SSPP for 7th grade. I met people who I thought were my friends...unfortunately I went for over a year being the only non-bitch *I hope*. I remember being sneered at if I talked to certain ppl so I thought um k. I talked to them anywayz. I swear, they're communists. But then 8th grade rolled around. I was separated from all of my "good friends" w/ some 8A exceptions. I think that was fate...I was supposed to be separated from them. And that led to more things. Soon I was being emotionally abused more than anyone can ever possibly know...not even you. But I was able to be open w/you. We ended up talking everyday about our usual nonsense and other shit. Sharing our depressedness. Then IT all happened and I switched groups. Bitchy popularity to comfy popularity. It was a blessing in disguise. I became closer to you n the rest of our ppl...I think the connection was made when you told the few of us @ Angie's Halloween party what you were really going through the previous years, I felt that I was meant to be there. Did I turn tables? Because I feel like I did, as conceited as that sounds, in at least a small way. It was because of God's will that I was supposed to meet some really awesome ppl. And I'm glad that I could talk to you at a certain level. I couldn't even tell my 'sister' Heather, who I've known since I was 5, any of that stuff. Then when we were pretty much at the core of our awesomeness, you moved to Highland and now the only way we communicate is through the internet. But I think we've gotten closer. We tell each other everything, well, I tell you everything. So you're there in spirit cause you hear about it eventually lol. I don't even talk to my dad this much. Hell, I don't talk to anyone this much. Maybe it's a good thing that we're obsessed w/ our computers and don't really have lives anymore. Maybe I was born on August 15 and I'm your twin and we were separated at birth and they changed my birthday so we wouldn't figure it out or something lol...Even though we've only known each other for um...erm...3 years, I feel that we've known each other for a lifetime. Promise me that we'll always be friends and each other's half!!!!!!! Forever and ever and ever! *get's girly* like omagosh. You're in my wedding...fo sho...I HEART U DUDE! And since I don't want you to get a big head and all gushy, I'm finished.  ps. seriously, we should alter all the sspp yearbooks and put me in em lol...

      Ok...insomnia is slowly kicking in. Since I bitched earlier, I feel quite better. Hope everyone has a fun and safe Independence Day! I'm goin over to Betsy's. Brittany and I are gonna convince Max that Britt had an experience w/ Hal *Sarah's dog* but lead him on to think that Hal's an actual person. It'll be great...must remember lol. So yea, I like died earlier. I was so tired. I forgot to call Britt to tell her I couldn't go to Cole's party but I think she figured it out after a while lol. O well. One day, the two of us will party, get wasted, and spend the night @ the SSPP playground. *sighs* Not anytime soon though. I have a lot going for me in the acting/singing community...it's not worth it just yet. Maybe if I get pissed at my dad again, that'll be a different story. I swear, someday, I'm gonna just drink my problems away. Tasha, you can then kick my ass. :) I'm hungry...gonna eat more peanut butter sandwiches...I'm just obsessed...

       independent- adj. free from the influence or control of others (i.e. self-governing, self-reliant, not adhering to any political party, not connected with others).................................................   Yeah...w/e. Supposedly we're 'independent' but I, for one, don't think we're free. Left and right we're being told what to do and what not to do. In the magazines we are told ways that we can become healthy and then if you turn the page a couple times, there's an anorexic looking model. I mean right there in front of our faces: look like this and you've got it made. Well, too bad not all of us are size 0. Proud to be 9! In some schools, towns, churches, etc. at one time or another, you couldn't read certain books (Fahrenheit 451, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harry Potter series...). Our music is being labeled as something bad and has a lovely PARENTAL ADVISORY warning on it. What happened to freedom of speech? If someone feels the need to say fuck in every sentence, give them the damn free right. And they obviously want to be heard by an audience, just let em! But hopefully parents are wise w/ the littluns...Even our movies are going downhill. I don't necessarily agree w/ everything in the Michael Moore movie according to what I've heard, but I'm not gonna bash the guy because of it. Did you ever notice that at lunch time at school, there are tons of groups or cliques? The bad thing is, I've seen the future and it's not looking good. I don't like labeling kids, but when choir went to North, you could tell who the next whores were, who the wannabe thugs were, the computer geeks, the outcasts, the cheerleaders. Everyone had a label. Then CHS had an open house for incoming Freshmen. The same thing was displayed again. These kids are going to learn the hard way. To them, it's like God forbid you talk to someone not in the group. I am just sick of the stereotyping, hypocrisy *although I can fall victim to that sometimes*, and vanity of others. Think about it...are we REALLY independent? Maybe we're just limiting ourselves to being free. Maybe something's programmed in our minds telling us that we can't be rebellious, that we can't be spontaneous, we can't be ourselves without being ridiculed. I guess I just don't understand   Final remarks: FREEDOM MY ASS

      "Light of the World"  You are the light of the world!  You are the light of the world!  But if that light is under a bushel,  Brrr, it's lost something kind of crucial  You got to stay bright to be the light of the world   You are the salt of the earth  You are the salt of the earth  But if that salt has lost its flavor  It ain't got much in its favor  You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth!   So let your light so shine before men  Let your light so shine  So that they might know some kindness again  We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!)   You are the city of God  You are the city of God  But if that city's on a hill  It's kinda hard to hide it well  You've got to stay pretty in the city of God   So let your light so shine before men  Let your light so shine  So that they might know some kindness again  We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!)   You are the light of the world  You are the light of the world  But the tallest candlestick  Ain't much good without a wick  You've got to live right to be the light of the world

      Yea...Earlier on VH1 or w/e, they had the new Creed. And they're called Alter Bridge. OMG, I watched the video and they whole thing, lyrics n all, are UBER cheezy. I'm sorry but ugh...it was so sad.  Looking back I clearly see What it is that's killing me Through the eyes of one I know I see a vision once let go I had it all  Constantly it burdens me Hard to trust and can't believe Lost the faith and lost the love When the day is done  Will they open their eyes And realize we are one On and on we stand alone Until our day has come When they open their eyes And realize we are one  I love the way I feel today But how I know the sun will fade Darker days seem to be What will always live in me But still I run  It's hard to walk this path alone Hard to know which way to go Will I ever save this day Will it ever change  Will they open their eyes And realize we are one Still today we carry on I know our day will come When they open their eyes And realize we are one  Will they open their eyes And realize we are one (its hard to walk this path alone hard to know which way to go) Will they open their eyes and realize we are one (lost the faith and lost the love when the day is done) Will they open their eyes And realize we are one  Seriously..if you heard the song, you might understand where I'm coming from...just maybe...So now I must go because I have to continue my summer reading *THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BOO!*, and I must go eat some ice cream because I had pizza earlier and it's a given.  ps. My wheatiness is really nice...I'm not like super red anymore..I don't even hurt! *YAY!*

      So yea...we went to an auction earlier for Applebee's...I got tons of stuff for my room and what not. I'm especially fond of my collage poster. In the word "ROLL" there's a whole bunch of singers/rock star pplz. It's amazing! There's Sir Elton John, Freddie Mercury, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, George Michael, Bono, Aretha Franklin, Jimi Hendrix, Axl Rose, Steven Tyler, among others lol. I'm thinkin one might be Madonna and Janis Joplin. I got some other pics n a movie poster or two. Some we spent like 50 cents on. The Roll collage is a good example of the 50 cent buys. Auctions rock my world. The only bad thing is I was out in the sun for another few hours. I'm an overly toasted wheat cracker...it's the shoulders. And now I have about 4 different tan lines and they overlap. It looks pretty funny for a while lol. So yea...I'm gonna take a nap. I think the heat got to me. Later all
