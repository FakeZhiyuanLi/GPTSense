      Medical research shows that high levels of cholesterol are associated with heart disease, the nation's number one killer. Statistics say that more than half of all Americans have cholesterol levels that exceed the recommended total. This  urlLink How Stuff Works  sites helps you determine if you're at risk and, if you are, what you can do about it.  And a little food trivia, compliments of Roy:   DID YOU KNOW?   Grapefruit juice can have a major effect on the potency of various medications, and can even cause an overdose when taking prescribed doses. Grapefruit juice decreases the production of a certain enzyme in the intestines that is involved in the metabolizing of about 1/3 of all drugs. Drinking grapefruit juice can increase the concentration of many drugs in the bloodstream to 3 or 4 times the normal concentration.    OK, I have been using the exercise bike more at the gym than usual. It hurts my bad knee a wee bit but it is because it is making it better. Cardio is good for everyone and no matter what you do at the gym, always remember the cardio. And I was reminded of, make sure you see your Doctor as well. Regular check ups always lets you know what is going on with your body, maybe even before you are aware of it.  So get up and do something, anything...Just do it!! Maddie :)

      My mom died of Ovarian Cancer. Did you know that it is the #1 hereditary cancer among women? Symptoms could take years to make themselves known and can spread throughout the liver and colon rapidly. Why am I telling you all of this you ask, well there are many ways of fighting of this disease and this post is dedicated to one of them, veggies!!   Cabbage - Key to Long Life?  Cabbage - and other cruciferous vegetables - are renowned for their cancer-fighting properties. In particular, cabbage provides significant amounts of fiber, vitamin C and an important class of nutrients called indoles. Research on indoles is focusing on their ability to reduce the risk of both prostate and breast cancer, but they appear to offer protection against other forms of cancer as well. Results of an Australian study published in the Aug. 20, 2003, issue of the International Journal of Cancer suggested that women whose diets were high in vegetables before they developed ovarian cancer lived longer after treatment than those whose diets didn't contain as many vegetables. Most importantly, women who ate cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower survived longer than those who did not. Try adding cabbage to salads and soups, laying leaves of cabbage on sandwiches or - especially tasty - shredding cabbage onto traditional Mexican foods like tostadas and tacos. Visit the Recipe section of  urlLink DrWeil.com  for recipes that use cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables.    So as you can see with good eating habits and exercise, this deadly disease can be curbed or even elimated.   And now on a lighter note, since laughter is the best cure all, I have a funny for you and hope it makes you smile as it did me :)   After starting a new diet, I altered my drive to town to avoid passing  my favorite bakery. I accidentally drove by the bakery this morning  and there in the window was a host of goodies. I felt this was no  accident, so I prayed, "Lord, it's up to you.... if you want me to  have any of those delicious goodies, create a parking place for me  directly in front of the bakery." And sure enough, my prayer was  answered. On the eighth time round the block, there it was!    OK everyone, get up off of that thing and take a walk, ride a bike, go play with the kids or even finish the house cleaning...Just Get Up and Do Something! Your body will thank you for it :)  Keep smiling, Maddie :)

      Well, I decided to start this blog as inspiration to myself and hopefully others as well. I will have a feature recipe each week and maybe some helpful links too. If anyone has any suggestions or favorite topics, please just give me a holler :)  So just for starters, since this blog will be about fitness, good health, and how to achieve it, I am going to start with a recipe that I have found to be very delicious.    INGREDIENTS: 12 large eggs 1 bag of frozen pepper strips (red, yellow and green) 1 med. onion 1 can unsalted mushrooms 3 roma tomatoes, diced 1 cup shredded cheese (whatever your favorite)  In a bowl mix together eggs, peppers, onion, tomatoes and mushrooms. Grease a 9x12 baking pan. I like to use Pam cooking spray. Pour egg mixture into pan and top with shredded cheese. Pepper to taste. Bake uncovered in a preheated 350* oven for about 45 minutes. Cut into 10 squares. Each square may be frozen in a freezer bag and microwaved when ready.   Substitutions: Egg Beaters may be used although I have found the regular eggs bake better. Options: I have also added bacon and sausage to this recipe. My favorite add in is chicken pieces.  Carbs: each square equals 4 net carbs but will vary if meat is added but only by a trace.  Have a favorite recipe? Please do not hesitate to let me know and I will post it or research it for you and post it.   Have a wonderful day, go for a walk and keep smiling :) Maddie :)
