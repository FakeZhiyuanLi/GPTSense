Nothing special to talk about here.  ------RP------  Maria looked over at the girl, raising an eyebrow. She walks over so she was standing next to her. "You're gonna get washed out to sea if you don't move." she says loudly, while looking out at the ocean.

Feeling :tired  Wearing :black  Thinking :pockey pockey pockey  Idolizing :casey stratton STILL  Listening to :casey stratton STILL ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ well.. i dont have much to write.  pretty much nothing happenned, except drivers ed, then seth comming over for the day.  blah.  -----------------RP------------------------  The girl layed on her picnic blanket, her long red hair laid out on the blanket around her,some on her, the blanket close to the shore line, soon to rise to it.  her feet were already wet from it, but it did not wake her, who had been sleeping for awhile now.  the sound of the waves crashing always worked as a lullabuy for herwhen she was tired.. and always put her into a peaceful slumber.  she always looked so beautiful when she slept.

       Currently   Wanting : to be home, still  Watching : Ed, Edd, and Eddy  Feeling : disturbed  Wearing : same thing as last time, seeing as I've been to lazy to change  Thinking : hmmm....*yawns*  Idolizing : no one  Listening to : nothing ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  hmmm, nothing special to talk about today. Just a plain old boring day. Talked to my mom on the phone. other then that, nothing...   ------RP------  Maria finished drying off and started to dry off her board cause she didn't want it to soak the interior of her car. After she was done with that she sat back in her beach chair and watched the waves crest against the shore. The tide was coming in, it was only a little while until the water would reach where she was. When that happened she'd leave.

       Currently writing this blog, and talking to my cutie ^_^  Wanting :STRAWBERRY POCKEY, DAMNIT!!! (lol)  Watching :the screen  Feeling :hmmm... "how do you FEEL about that?"  Wearing :boxers and a tight, conforming black baby-doll T  Thinking :wow... nyan!  Idolizing :Casey Stratton still  Listening to :Casey stratton still ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  wow.  okay.  the topic for one works for both REAL life, and the RP.  IRL, yesterday, i went rafting with my dads GF, her kids, and my brother, iun a rubber boat.  first, we got lost.  (we started out at about 3 pm BTW!)  then, a chamber of the boat got popped, and couldnt really hold EVERYONE anymore.  that happenned at about 5 pm.  i was the first to choose to get out, and i started swimming/ walking through the DISGUSTING river.  black stone river.  more muck, swamp, buggy then river.  (even the officer said it was not safe to swim in)  and what was grocer.. there was not a SINGLE LIVING fish in there.  though i saw a dead fish floating on the top... ewww....  ok.  back onto the story.  ok, at about 10, a search and rescue team found us.  my dad, who had stayed behind, had called them.  boy am i glad.  when i was getting out of the river, i sunk into muck up to my THIGHS.  lol.  safe to say, some SERIOUS laundry was done.  lol.  and SERIOUS showering.  grossness.  though my toenails are still green from it, and i got tonsa blisters n stuff.  but all is fine ^_^.  lol.  well.  how was YOUR saturday??  onto RP!!  -----------------------------RP-------------------------------  The girl saw her wave and smiled, but did not wave back.  She then watched her approach the shore, and dry off.  she smiled quietly, and curled up a little, feeling the chill of the night comming.  she wasnt ready to head home yet though.  she wanted to just sit there.. and watch the waves, and other pretty sights.

       Currently   Wanting : to go home  Watching : ....I was watching "Spider 2" but now it's *shudders* a golf game *shudders*  Feeling : Upset and abused  Wearing : black short-shorts and a black, red, and white ankle length confitting shirt.  Thinking : god, I so hate them right now...  Idolizing : no one  Listening to : nothing... ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Hello everyone. I swear, I want to get out of here so badly. My grandparents are driving me crazy. My grandfather is a racists, homophobic asshole who has no respect for anyone. He changes the channel on the TV without even asking if someone is watching something and you have to repeat things to him a million times. My grandmother complains about everything and it's starting to get really annoying. My aunt Bridgette keeps coming in and trying to boss me around as if she's my mother. I'm sorry, but unless you're my parents, you have to ASK me to do things, you don't ORDER me around and TELL me to do them, because I WON'T. I'm not very happy with my Aunt Judy either. How dare she try and block the bridge so the hippies who live up the mountains by us coulding get past. THAT IS SO FUCKING MEAN! I can't stand this family. All the older people are a bunch of rednecks who are racist in all ways and it's really pissing me off. Only thing good about being here is hanging out with Rachel. At least she's not crazy, a redneck, or whatnot. I feel comfortable around her. She's a cool cousin, I'm glad to know her. Anyway, enough bickering for me. Onto the RP^^  -----RP-----  Maria found a good wave and started to ride it, slowly rising on her board until she was standing. She had caught it perfectly and rode it until it crested and fell back into the ocean. She caught a couple more before she started back into shore. She could feel someone watching her and turned and then saw the girl on the picnic blanket. She smiles and waves a little as she stepped out of the water onto the slowly cooling sand. Her towel was a little ways up and she went over to it, drying herself off some, having fallen off her board once while surfing and completely soaking herself.

       Currently   Wanting : not sure  Watching : Danny Phantom  Feeling : zonky  Wearing : Blue capri pants and a blue spagetti strap tank top.  Thinking : Chuckie cheeses...hmmm, I wanna go there xp  Idolizing : someone  Listening to : nothing ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  hmmm, hello everyone. I really don't have much to say today. Nothing really happened. So I'll just go right to the RP. Love ya mel.  ------RP-------  Maria nibbles on her hotdog while she walks down the boardwalk. She goes back down to the beach after she was done eating. There was still a few more hours of sunlight, which meant she had plenty of time to catch a few more waves before she got going. She starts out for the water and when she gets out far enough she lays down on her stomache on her board and starts to paddle out, waiting her time till go got ready to catch a wave.

       Currently RPing  Wanting :strawberry pocky  Watching :the  mentor in my head.  hes telling me to destroy the world.  Feeling :yay  Wearing :sexy blue jeans, and a black sweater thats just sext, and crazy considering its in the 90's F.  Thinking :lalalala  Idolizing :Casey Stratton  Listening to :Casey Stratton ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ There was a young girl of about 16 wandering the beach.  she had long red hair that curled at the ends, and slightly tanned skin.  She had deep green eyes, and was wearing a black bikini bathing suit, with a black sheer tie around skirt around her waste, and a silver metal anklet.  She was slender and pretty with a young innocent, yet intelligent.  her gaze seemed to explore more than just what was on the outside, but far below, where most could not see.    She had always loved the ocean.  she lived in a house near the side of the beach.  she was often seen out there collecting shells, or reading, sometimes even going in the water.  sometimes she would just sit on the rocks in the ocean, and just think for hours.  she was about 5'5 and 120 lbs.    Currently, she was out collecting seashells, walking along the beach barefoot, and smiling softly, her feet in the water whenever a wave would come.

       Currently    Wanting : to see my lovely Melody  Watching : Totally Spies  Feeling : Giddy in a sad way  Wearing : green pants and my grey tanktop with purple roses on it.  Thinking : rave rave rave! (don't ask...)  Idolizing : techno music  Listening to : some techno/rave music on the show I'm watching, haha ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Hello everyone. I trust you are all doing well? That's good. I'm doing pretty well myself. Other then the initial shock of that email from Kelsey yesterday, I have had anymore problems. I'm not gonna let Chris or her bother me anymore. I'm past that. I'm going to dissapear if I can. Anyway, my grandparents waterline broke and my grandparents bedroom's carpet was SOAKED...it was quite amusing. And then my satelite in my room stopped working...hopefully they'll get it working. I can't miss my shows man! I need them, they are life to me! Oh well. I tell ya, my gramps get the cheap bateries that only last a little while. I so need to teach him to spend just a little more for the brand names, cause they last so much longer...oh well, just gotta make sure I save often. Anyway, that's about all the excitement for today. Just been laying around playing Lufia: the legend returns.   And with further ado, Melody and I have decided to hold our own little two-person Roleplay here on our blog. So enjoy^.^ (info: yuri, beach, romance)  --------------- ROLEPLAY ------------------ Maria Maloy stood, the hot sand under her wet feet. She brushed a few strands of long raven black hair from her cerulean blue eyes before looking out at the ocean. She could see some dolphins in the distance and smiled lightly. She picked up her surf board and started up towards the boardwalk, all that surfing had gotten her hungry.

       Currently  sitting here  Wanting : to be home as usual  Watching : nothing  Feeling : amused  Wearing : shorts and tank top  Thinking : hmmmm.....what am I thinking?  Idolizing : Adam Sessler  Listening to : nothing ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Hello everyone. Sorry haven't posted in a couple days. Been so boring that I really didn't feel like posting. But today was fun. Most of the family is here now. I did face painting most of the day for the little kids, man they love that. I started getting bored and started painting all over my arms and legs and then got a mirror and painted all over my face. I had stripes like a tiger and flowers and stars and hearts and all kinds of other things all over my body. It was really neat just walking around and having people laugh and go "what happened to you?" At least people can't say I'm unique^.^ Anyway...I went riding on my cousin Floyd's four-wheeler and man, I LOVE that thing. It's an automatic. You don't know how great one of those things are until you try it. No having to shift every two minutes to go up and down and such. Shifting is such a pain, but with Floyd's,  no need to shift it shifts for you. It's really nice. Anyway, from all the paint on me and the mudd and water from riding around I was pretty grimey. So I went back to the trailer and took a quick shower and cleaned off. I felt very clean then, although I kinda miss my tiger stripes *pouts* oh well^.^  And another thing, I've realized what I truly want to be when I grow up. Like, I just realized it yesterday. I want to become a game designer. I don't know why or how I realized this (may have something to do with I was watching g4tech tv all day, haha) but I know it to be true. I really truly want to become a game designer. Programming or making character or storyboards or anything. I just want to be a part of the game designing experience. It would be the best thing in the world if you ask me. My mom says she thinks I can do it and Melody says she's 100% behind me, so nothing can stop me. Next year I'm going to a technical school for computer programming and networking and such, and then after that I'll go to a school like ITT tech or something for the game design course. And after that, who knows what will happen! It's all very exciting to think about. That when I grow up that any or all of you may play games that I was part of creating. It's just really cool to think about, isn't it?   Furthermore, I have put together a short list of things I REALLY want to do when I grow up. Just silly things, some a bit perverted I guess, but hey, they are things I just want to do, you know?  1. Have one of those artists who paint on people's bodies use me as a model. 2. Go to a nudist colony (I always wondered how they live, it would be interesting, eh?) 3. Visit Europe 4. Visit Japan 5. Go to G-phoria and e3 (gaming conventions)  6. Skydive 7. When I'm older (over 19 probably) I want to be on that girls gone wild video series. Why? Just because. But that could change by the time I get older, you never know *laughs* (I'm such a perv, bad me *whacks hand*) 8. Be a model for some famous clothing line...(why? Because I love dressing up, haha)  There are so many other things I want to do. I'll have a full list up on my website whenever I get it^.^ I'll let you all know when that's up. May be a month or two or even more. Anyway, that's about all for today. I'll do a quick entry in the RP now.  ------------RP-------------  Maria smiles and looks out at the water. "Yea, I love to surf. My father taught me how when I was very young. He died when I was 10, his boat crashed when there was a huge storm out on sea. 3 of his friend's died with him." her voice held no remorse, but her eyes softened a bit. "But I'm sure you don't want to hear stuff like that." she smiles and looks down at the girl. "The names Maria, you? Oh, and you should move, the water is getting pretty close. You're stuff is gonna float away."
