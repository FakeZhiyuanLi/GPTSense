      The weekend that passed has got to be without a doubt, one of the longest one ever, thanks to the olympic games. Although volunteering is extremely tiring, its fulfilling. I'm in the VIP transport section, and have seen tons of people, presidents of countries, royalty, and just yesterday Blair and his wife which i think is pretty cool, didnt say hi or anything there was quite a lot of security, but still kinda cool. i bet ill see everyone on the closing ceremony though.  ok i also rented out butterfly effect this weekend, and it blew my mind. i've been getting into all this time travel business. it was amazing in the sense that he kept on going back and changing something small(his childhood was actually extrmely traumatic by the way!) and seeing how much of a difference it made. see i think in in a way everybody would like to do that right? but i dont know, a while back i said to myself that i wont regret anything, because who knows where the other path might take me, and so far my life is fine. but theres just one thing, I wish i studied harder and got a better degree,  I am thinking this way now because the job hunt isnt going too well, its stressing me out to the maximum, and i know it will all get better one day or another i just wish that day comes soon.But i dont know, if i travel back in time and do well in my exams lets say, will i be in the same state of happiness as i am in now, thats a risk i dont think i am willing to make(even if i got the chance). So is this regret? i dont really wish it happened, it would have been nice if it had had happened, and my life lead me to the exact same place as i am in now(i am fucking up with the tenses here) but i dont think that would have been possible  Has anyone else realised that all these time travel movies happen to fucked up kids(i am thinking of donnie darko as well), so these modern day movie heros are actually kids who were either raised wrongly or just really fucking unfortunate, and figured things out? i dont know i was just racking my mind for other time travel movies and came up with back to the future. was michael J.fox twisted as well, i dont remember the movie too well but he wasnt was he? as in he never really had to see a shrink, he had women issues i remember, but so does eveybody, hang on i figured it out. ITS ALWAYS THE WOMEN!!!!! ok major breakthrough here, i am sure married guys have figure this part out already, but men never go out of there way for anything other than for women.In the butterfly effect, he kept on changing things because he wanted the girl, in donnie darko he was haunted by the rabbit dude who was the one who killed his girlfirend(I know they are only movies and dont necessarily reflect real life but there is definalty a pattern here). I see it in myself as well i do believe most of my actions are because i want to be with my girlfriend or want to attract as many women as possible. men would move mountains for a woman if they had it in there hands. Final note: ok so i know women are the key(i had a feeling they were important but not to everything EVERYTHING!), and we try everything we can to get the girl, but when we do why oh why are they so complex.

      ok so i was in bed last night completely exhausted (ive been a volunteer for the olympics for the last 3 days running like an idiot) and couldnt get to sleep. i figured out why i cant stick to one thing, i always say ok i want to do this, or start up on this new hobby, or study for some course, or what ever, it just never works out, not really, it works for maybe 3 weeks if its something educational, 6 months if its a hobby that i can see my self get into and even then, when the hobby is going well after 2-3 years, and spent a fortune, i move on to something different. And i thought about it, its because i want to do everything, i really want to try to see as much and know as much as possible before what ever destiny has in store for me. and truthfully i dont know how much of a good thing this is, it sounds more like a bad one, actually it is a bad one. And i am really trying to change it, thats the main reason I quit smoking, just to say that fuck that, I am going to try really hard because this is what i want, dont know how long that will last,  i have a feeling that one day I'll be reading this blog and either will be either feeling stupid and guilty, or proud that i figured it out then.

      Ok so this is supposed to be like a virtual cyberspace diary right? i can post anything that i like and the chances of anyone i know ever reading it is probably minimal, sounds nice. I was recomended this site as a theropeutic way of getting stuff off my chest, as things in my life right now seem to be a bit too overwhelming and the just keep piling up, i know i am only 25 and shouldnt be complaining and there are tons of ppl out there with millions of more problems but hey i figure we wouldnt be humans if we didnt complain. Or is it that after a while we stop complaining because there is no point? hell i am still young so i am going to complain, i really believe i can make a difference. by the way the main reason for my frustration is me not being able to find work in the UK, seriously, actually any country in the world other than greece or in the middle-east will be fine. so if anybody has a company or a company idea and just happened to stumble across this blog i do have some good qualifications (i really believe i do!) just email me. (ok, the voice in the back of my head is laughing at the possibility of that actually happening). i cant think of anything else right now, i guess i can always come back and blog later. later
