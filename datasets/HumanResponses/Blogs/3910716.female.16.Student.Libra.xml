      i feel like i havent talked to the normal people i talk to in like YEARS!!! welp like weeks or months im not sure...   i cant wait for school to start and everything to get back to normal... i wont have to work ALL FREAKIN DAY!!!  why why why do i replay that cd you gave me just to relive the happy memories... im so over you i dont wan tanythign to do with you but for some reason that cd is so comforting maybe tis because when you gave it to me it meant something i never knew before... but now i dont know i was so happy for that short time before... well before you became something i never knew... i didnt expect it out of you of all the boys ive dated not you... but i guess ive come to learn no matter how great a guy can be you never can picture his worse.. and i wish it would have ended better maybe i wouldnt have this void like as if i left something unsaid and left without a goodbye... but more than me missing you i miss your sister i miss your mom i miss the way i felt when your family treated me like i was one of them... but now i have this feeling that what i learned form you will shape and form how i feel about this someone **NEW**   mr new your Awseum i cant belive we talk everynite for 4 hours about... well what do we tla about... tell me aht you thinkin even if it scares you to death its only a taste of how i feel
