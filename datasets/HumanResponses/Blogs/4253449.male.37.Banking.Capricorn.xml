      Thought I would try a make a list (more for me) on the many places I have been. Starting in college with a study abroad trip to Spain for a month, I have been on the go ever since. This probably is a result of growing up in the military on always being on the move. Born in Myrtle Beach and living in Panama, North Dakota, North Carlolina and Virginia, all before the sixth grade. Variety is the spice of life, and this can be accomplished through travel. I hope I never stop going places. Most the places listed below are on my webpage, captured through the eyes of a camera, and most recently a digital Nikon.  Travels Abroad: -College - Study abroad program in the summer of 1988. One month at the University of Madrid. -College Graduation - May of 1989 - a two week tour back to Spain and Portugal -A third trip to Spain in 1999 with my brother Greg, and college friend who was on the first Spain trip and her boyfriend. We took three weeks and a rented car and went all around Spain, Portugal and Morrocco. -Ireland in October of 2001 (one month after 9/11) very weird traveling then - we left Ireland the day the US started bombing Afghanistan -A Carribean cruise in Nov 2000 to many islands in the Southern Carribean -Dominican Republic - A vacation where I got SCUBA Certified. July 2003 -A 6 day whirlwind tour of London and Paris with Greg, Robin and Debbie - Nov 2003  Cities here in the US through vacations and work based seminars: Charleston New Orleans - 3 times Long Beach Los Angeles San Diego El Centro Ca and a quick day trip to Mexico Key West twice New York City several time including a three day trip in High School And, of course I live in the Washington DC area  Wish List: Chicago Seattle San Fran Anywhere new and different

      Got an email from a high school friend, who asked "what's new?". Thought this response summed it up.   Marriage!! good lord no. I am keeping busy with work, travel, and all that jazz. You know Greg is remarried, and the wife is now pregnant. Roy has two sons and one is like 17 now, and no one evers hears from Peter. Roy and Peter still live inthe staunton area, Greg lives up here in NOVA near me. We hang out all the time. Next month I will have been at chevy chase bank for 15 years. Ugh. I told myself that when I finished my Master (MBA - May of 2001) that I would get a better job, but I have been too busy to look. I actually like my job, and get to do all kinds of fun things. Don't we have a reunion next year. I doubt I would go since I dont even remember who the hell I graduated with (except you of course). My passion is digital photography and web design, so you can see all about that on my webpage (link below). I dont know what else is going on. Oh, I bought my townhouse 9 years ago for about $130,000 which I thought was outrageous. The one next door (and mine is better) just listed for $390,000. Real Estate in Fairfax is crazy. I need to cash in and retire. Can you believe we have been out of high school for 19 years, college for 15 years, and I have been a home owner for 9 years. How did we get so old so fast? Well, good hearning from you. Ill try and email more often.
