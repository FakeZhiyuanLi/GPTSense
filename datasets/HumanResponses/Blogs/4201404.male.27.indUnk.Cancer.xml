                                                    Behind The Scenes Of The Iraq War   The plan for the Iraq war, which has erupted in the face of opposition from the entire world, was drawn up at least decades ago, by Israeli strategists   In its attempt to realize its strategy of destabilizing or dividing the Middle Eastern Arab states, Israel has Egypt, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia on its list of subsequent targets.   As these lines are being written, the United States of America has begun striking at Iraq. Despite the fact that most countries of the world, and even the majority of the USA's allies, opposed it, the US administration was determined for the strike to go ahead. When we look behind the scenes of this insistence, it seems that Israel and its powerful lobby in the US, have the greatest share in the make-up.   In fact, Israel's policy aimed at the fragmentation of Iraq has lengthy historical roots-   The Age-Old Israeli Plan to Divide Iraq   An ambitious report entitled "A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s," which appeared in the World Zionist Organization's periodical Kivunim in February 1982 disclosed a strategy aimed at making the whole of the Middle East a kind of "living space" for Israel. The report, drawn up by Oded Yinon, an Israeli journalist and formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of Israel, set out the scenario of the "division of Iraq" in these terms:   Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria- Iraq is, once again, no different in essence from its neighbors, although its majority is Shi'ite and the ruling minority Sunni. Sixty-five percent of the population has no say in politics, in which an elite of 20 percent holds the power. In addition there is a large Kurdish minority in the north, and if it weren't for the strength of the ruling regime, the army and the oil revenues, Iraq's future state would be no different than that of Lebanon in the past- In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. 1)   This was not the only announcement of the Israeli plan to atomize Middle East, including Iraq. As Israel Shahak, the notable Israeli scholar known for his dedication to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, explained that Yinon was just echoing the views of Israeli hawks:   The idea that all the Arab states should be broken down, by Israel, into small units, occurs again and again in Israeli strategic thinking. For example, Ze'ev Schiff, the military correspondent of Ha'aretz (and probably the most knowledgeable in Israel, on this topic) writes about the "best" that can happen for Israeli interests in Iraq: "The dissolution of Iraq into a Shi'ite state, a Sunni state and the separation of the Kurdish part" (Ha'aretz 6/2/1982). Actually, this aspect of the plan is very old. 2)   Thus, the plan was a serious one and this has been confirmed by the age-old Israeli support to non-Arab or non-Muslim minorities in the Muslim Arab states. The rebellious Kurds of northern Iraq was one of these strategic allies of Israel. During their revolt against the Baghdad regime, 1961-75, they have been financially and militarily supported by Israel. Israelis would love to see them carve up the northern part of Iraq, no matter how bloody and devastating such a civil war would be. However, the revolt failed in 1975, after loosing the support of its major patron, the Shah.   Fifteen years later, a new opportunity arose for Israel, an opportunity from the ambitions of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.   Israel's Role in the Gulf War   Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, after his bloody war against Iran in the 80's, invaded Kuwait in a sudden attack on August 1, 1990, giving rise to an international crisis. Israel headed the list of those forces that encouraged that crisis. Israel was the fiercest supporter of the attitude adopted by the United States in the wake of the invasion of Kuwait. The Israelis even regarded the United States as moderate, and wanted a harsher policy. To such an extent in fact that the President of Israel Chaim Herzog recommended that the American use nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the Israeli lobby in the United States was working to bring about a wide-ranging attack on Iraq.   This whole situation encouraged the idea in the United States that the attack against Iraq under consideration was actually planned in Israel's interests. Pat Buchanan summarized this idea in the words "There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States."   Israelis had also initiated a serious propaganda campaign on the issue. Since this campaign was largely waged in secret, Mossad also entered the equation. Rogue Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky provides important information on this subject. According to Ostrovsky, Israel had wanted to wage war with the United States against Saddam long before the Gulf crisis. So much so in fact, that Israel began to implement the plan immediately after the Iran-Iraq war. Ostrovsky reports that Mossad's Psychological Warfare department (LAP - LohAma Psychologist) set about an effective pro-war campaign using misinformation techniques. 3)   A Mossad Agent Describes the Gulf War   Ostrovsky describes how Mossad used agents or sympathizers in various parts of the world in this campaign. Among the tools employed in the campaign were the horrible massacres done by missiles launched against civilian targets in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. As Ostrovsky makes clear, Mossad's later use of these missiles as a propaganda tool was quite peculiar, since those missiles had actually been directed towards their targets by Mossad, with the help of information from US satellites. Having supported Saddam throughout his war with Iran, Israel was now disclosing his crimes. Ostrovsky writes:   The Mossad leaders know that if they could make Saddam appear bad enough and a threat to the Gulf oil supply, of which he'd been the protector up to that point, then the United States and its allies would not let him get away with anything, but would take measures that would all but eliminate his army and his weapons potential, especially if they were led to believe that this might just be their last chance before he went nuclear. 4)   The Israelis were so determined on this matter, and with regard to the United States, that on August 4, 1990, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy issued a diplomatically worded threat to William Brown, the American ambassador to Israel, stating that Israel "expects the U.S. will fulfill all of the goals it set for itself at the beginning of the gulf crisis," in other words that it attack Iraq. According to Levy, if the United States failed to do so, Israel would act unilaterally. 5)   It would be of enormous benefit to Israel to have the United States engage in the war and for Israel to remain entirely uninvolved: and that is indeed what happened.   Israel Forces the USA to War   However, the Israelis were actively involved in the United States' war plans. Some US staff officers involved in planning Operation Desert Storm received fine tactical advice from the Israelis that "the best way of wounding Saddam was to strike at his family."   The Mossad-inspired propaganda campaign reported by Ostrovsky set up the necessary public backing for the Gulf War. It was again Mossad local assistants who lit the touchpaper for the war. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm, run by Tom Lantos of the Israeli lobby, prepared a dramatic scenario to convince members of Congress on the subject of war against Saddam. Turan Yavuz, a noted Turkish journalist, describes the incident:   October 9, 1990. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm organizes a sitting in Congress on the subject of "Iraq's Barbarities." A number of "eye witnesses" brought to the session by the lobbying firm maintain that Iraqi troops killed new-born babies in the hospital wards. One "eye witness" describes the savagery in enormous detail, saying that Iraqi soldiers killed 300 new-born babies in one hospital alone. This information deeply disturbs the members of Congress. This works to President Bush's advantage. However, it later emerges that the eye witness brought by Hill and Knowlton to Congress is in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington. Nevertheless, the daughter's account is sufficient for members of Congress to give Saddam the nickname "Hitler". 6)   This leads to just one conclusion: that Israel played an important role in the United States' to wage its first war on Iraq. The second one is not much different.   The Pretext of "War Against Terrorism"   Contrary to popular belief, the plan to attack Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime by force was prepared and placed on Washington's agenda long before the genesis of the "war against terrorism," which emerged in the wake of September 11. The first indication of this plan emerged in 1997. A group of pro-Israeli hawkish strategists in Washington D.C. began to put forward the scenario of the invasion of Iraq by manipulating the "neo-con" think-tank, called PNAC (Project for The New American Century). The most notable names in the PNAC were those of Donald Rumsfeld and ###### Cheney, who as defense secretary and vice-president would be the most influential figures in the George W. Bush administration.   An article titled "Invading Iraq Not a New Idea for Bush Clique: 4 Years Before 9/11 Plan Was Set" written by William Brunch and published in the Philadelphia Daily News, sets out the following facts:   But in reality, Rumsfeld, Vice President ###### Cheney, and a small band of conservative ideologues had begun making the case for an American invasion of Iraq as early as 1997 - nearly four years before the Sept. 11 attacks and three years before President Bush took office.   An obscure, ominous-sounding right-wing policy group called Project for the New American Century, or PNAC - affiliated with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rumsfeld's top deputy Paul Wolfowitz and Bush's brother Jeb - even urged then-President Clinton to invade Iraq back in January 1998. 7)   Is Oil the Real Objective?   Why were the PNAC members so determined to attack Iraq? The same article continues:  While oil is a backdrop to PNAC's policy pronouncements on Iraq, it doesn't seem to be the driving force. [Ian] Lustick, [a University of Pennsylvania political science professor and Middle East expert,] while a critic of the Bush policy, says oil is viewed by the war's proponents primarily as a way to pay for the costly military operation.   "I'm from Texas, and every oil man that I know is against military action in Iraq," said PNAC's Schmitt. "The oil market doesn't need disruption."   Lustick believes that a more powerful hidden motivator may be Israel. He said Bush administration hawks believe that a show of force in Iraq would somehow convince Palestinians to accept a peace plan on terms favorable to Israel- 8)   This, therefore, is the principal motivation behind the plan to attack Iraq: to serve Israel's Middle East strategy.   This fact has also been identified by other Middle East experts. Cengiz ?andar, a Turkish Middle East expert, for instance, describes the real power behind the plan to attack Iraq thus:   ... Who is directing the attack on Iraq? Vice-President ###### Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice. These are the "senior level" backers of the attack. Yet the rest of the iceberg is even richer and more interesting. There are a number of "lobbies."  Heading these lobbies are the Jewish Institute for Security Affairs team, pro-Likud and Israeli-right and known for their close relations with US arms manufacturers. These have close relations with the "arms lobby," Lockheed, Northrop, General Dynamics and Israeli military industries ... JINSA's fundamental principle is this: America's and Israel's security are inseparable. In other words, they are the same thing.   JINSA's objective is not solely the overthrow of the Saddam regime in Iraq: it also supports the overthrow of the Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Egyptian and Iranian regimes with a logic of "total war," and the subsequent importation of "democracy." ... In other words, a number of American Jews on the same wavelength as the most extreme factions in Israel at the moment comprise the hawks in Washington. 9)   The Israeli Strategy for The Muslim Middle East   In short, there are those in Washington who are encouraging a war aimed first at Iraq and then at Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran and Egypt. The most distinguishing feature of these is that they are lined up alongside, and even equivalent to, the "Israeli lobby."   No matter how much they speak of "American interests," these people are actually supporting Israeli interests. A strategy of waging war against the whole of the Middle East and turning all the peoples of the region against it cannot be to the United States' advantage. The adoption of such a strategy can only be possible if the United States is bound to Israel, by means of the Israeli lobby, which is profoundly influential in this country's foreign policy.   It is for these reasons that behind the strategy which began to be set in motion after September 11 and is aimed at re-arranging the entire Islamic world, lies Israel's strategy for dominating the Middle East. Ever since its foundation, Israel has aimed at restructuring the Middle East, making it manageable and secure to itself. The search for security is of course a legitimate one, but the way that Israel chose to achieve this end is wrong: From the beginning, Israel decided to establish security behind an "iron wall" that would separate itself from the Arabs, and most important of all, protect the lands that Israel occupied through methods of invasion, colonization and depopulation. This strategy of reaping the wind had its consequence as a century of constant clash between Israelis and Arabs. Had Israel chosen a peaceful path to secure its existence, by building good relations with its Arab neighbors and refraining from aggression, Jews and Muslims could peacefully co-exist in the Middle East, as they have done before for centuries.   However, the radical Zionist ideology still denies any chance to peace and relentlessly tries to transform the whole Middle East to create a "living space" for Israel. It has been using its influence in the United States for that purpose in recent years, and to a large extent directs Washington's Middle East policy. The post-September 11 climate gave Israel the opportunity it had been seeking. Pro-Israeli ideologues who for years had been propounding the falsehood that Islam itself - not some militant radicals who use Islam as a shelter - posed a threat to the West and the United States, and who encouraged the mistaken concept of a "clash of civilizations," have been trying to incite the United States against the Islamic world in the wake of September 11. As early as 1995, Israel Shahak of the Jerusalem Hebrew University wrote former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's obsession with "the idea of an Israeli-led anti-Islamic crusade". Nahum Barnea, a commentator from the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, stated that same year that Israel was making progress "[to] become the Western vanguard in the war against the Islamic enemy." 10)   All that has happened in the years which have followed is that Israeli hawks have made their intentions even clearer. The political climate in the wake of September 11 prepared the ground for this intention to be made a reality.   The Only Way to World Peace: An Islamic Union   The situation may be summarized as follows: Israel's aim is to reshape the Middle East in line with its own strategic interests. In order to do this, it needs a "world power." That power is the United States; and Israeli hawks, thanks to their influence there, are trying to wage a militant American strategy against the Islamic world. Although Israel is a small state with a population of only 4.5 million, the plans drawn up by Israeli strategists and their counterparts in the West are directing the world affairs.   What needs to be done in the face of this?   1) "Counter lobby activities" need to be adopted in the face of the Israeli lobby's influence in the United States in order to develop dialogue between the United States and the Islamic world and to invite it to seek peaceful solutions to Iraq and similar problems. A wide section of the United States wishes to see their country adopt a fairer Middle East policy. Many statesmen, strategists, journalists and intellectuals have expressed this, and a "peace of civilizations" movement must be carried forward in cooperation with them. The approach inviting the US administration to peaceful solutions must be carried forward at governmental and civil society organization level.   2) A reconciliation between Israel and the Muslim Middle East must be sought. There are many "peaceniks", i.e. pro-peace Israelis, too. Many Israeli statesmen, religious leader, opinion leaders and many Jews from all around the world are urging the Israeli state to refrain from its brutal occupation and accept a just peace to live along with their Arab neighbors. Cooperation with them, especially on the inter-faith level, should be initiated and encouraged. One thing should never be forgotten: The rise of radicalism, enmity and violence is bad for all parties.   3) Alongside all this, a deeper rooted solution lies in a project which can resolve all the problems between the Islamic world and the West and deal with the fragmentation, suffering and poverty in the Islamic world and totally alter it: An Islamic Union. Recent developments have shown that the whole world, not just Islamic regions, stands in need of an "Islamic Union." This Union should heal the radical elements in the Islamic World, and establish good relations between Muslim countries and the West, especially the United States.   This Union, can find a solution to the mother of all problems: The Arab-Israeli conflict. With Israel retreating to its pre-67 borders and Arabs recognizing its right to exist, there can be real peace in the Middle East. And Jews and Muslims - both Children of Abraham and believers in one true God - may peacefully co-exist in the Holy Land, as they have done during the past centuries. Then, Israel would need no strategy to destabilize or divide the Arab States. And it will not have to face the results of occupation in forms of terrorism and constant fear of annihilation. Then, both the Israeli and Iraqi (and Palestinian) children may grow up in peace and security. That is a Middle East that any sane person should work to see.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------   1- (ed.)

      The Untold StoryBackgroundChechens are one of the few peoples indigenous to the Caucasus Mountains. Chechens are one of the few peoples who are indigenous to the Caucasus Mountains. They are ethnically very different from the Slavic Russians. Even linguistically the Chechen language is in the class of languages called Ibro-Caucasian, making English, German, and French a lot closer to Russian than Chechen. More importantly, all Chechens are Muslims who have throughout their history resisted Russian occupation. Basically there are no historical or legal reasons for Russia to claim Chechnya part of the Russian federation. The barbaric ethnic cleansing that is going on today in Chechnyais the latest episode of a war that has lasted for over 300 hundredyears. Chechens have never in their history joined any type of union or signed any piece of paper entitling Russia the right torule their land. Going as far back as the 16th century, Russia has repeatedly practice ethnic cleansing against the Chechens and therest of the north Caucasian Muslim nations. In the first Chechen war of 1994-1996, 12% of the Chechen population perished, that is about 120 thousand lives, almost all civilians. And that is no accident. It is typical of the way the Russia wages war. In 1944, the entire Chechen nation was exiled from its land along with the majority of the Muslim nations of the north Caucasus.During this forced migration 60% of people perished from cold, hunger and diseases. The idea was to dissolve the Chechen identity altogether. Simply put, for as long as there is a Chechen living in the north Caucasus, Russian politicians will not be free to rule the region. During this close to 400 hundred years of war, the Russians have never fought a clean war. They have repeatedly targeted the Chechen civilians, only because they have never won face-to-face combat against the Chechen freedom fighters, by Allah's grace that will never happen. On the other hand the Chechens have always been very humane to their captives. In the last war scores of POWs caught by the Chechens embraced Islam. Many more young conscripts were returned to their mothers. However, no mercy was ever shown to the mercenaries or military pilots that killed civilians. At the end of the 20-month-old war the Russian army pulled out of Chechnya dragging its tail between its legs.The last war has left Chechnya and its people crippled. What little industry was there is totally destroyed. Utility services are nonexistent. Hospitals lack everything from medication to equipment. Water is contaminated. A great percentage of the survivors are handicapped. Infant mortality rate is probably one of the highest in the world. In other words Chechnya and its population are in no state to wage war against so called a super power. The Russian FSB has been busy waging a propaganda war against the Chechen people. The kidnappings were started in order to make sure the outside world would stay far away from Chechnya. Members of humanitarian organizations that dared enter Chechnya were brutally dismembered by orders of the Russian FSB.Russian government blew up apartments in Moscow killing about 300 Russian civilians, then turned around and blamed it on the Chechens. All this was done to justify invading Chechnya. The way the apartment bombings were carried out required a high expertise in the matter of bringing down buildings. This is a rare expertise, which the Chechens never had. Had the Chechens had that expertise they would have demonstrated it against the Russian army by now.The Kremlin needs this war as a tool to make sure a president sympathetic to the current regime would win the next elections. Mr. Putin seems to fit that bill. More than likely he has promised that Yeltsin and his gang would not be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars. Many, including some in the Russian media itself, have theorized that the Russian government is behind the apartment bombings. This is the enemy the Chechen people are facing. An enemy that does not even have mercy on its own civilians let alone the Chechen civilians.Our brothers and sisters in Chechnya and many decent freedom loving citizens of the world are wondered why no one is forcing the Russians to stop the bombing campaigns. All they see is destruction and mass murder. They do not see "rebels" hiding out or careful efforts by the Russians to avoid civilian targets. They watch as village after village is decimated indiscriminately. Most do not understand how this can be happening to them again. Only this time, worse. We urge you to respond to their cries.THE DESTRUCTIVE INVASION OF WAR IN CHECHNYA WHAT TO DO ?We ask all readers of this booklet to please follow this stepwise approach to face this very sad and disturbing human tragedy1. Pray· Pray to Allah that He will help the Chechen innocent citizens to overcome their miseries, that He almighty will give them victory, and that He shows the mislead young members of the Russian army the truth in order to change their hearts to Islam.· Please ask the Imam of your masjid to include the Unfair Destructive War in Chechnya as the main issue of the Jumaa Prayers Ceremony (Khutba). · Hold a special "prayer of need" (Salatul Hajah) that is recommended in times of distress and great needs.· Remember the Chechens in your du'as. Supplicate for their well being. Ask Allah (SWT) to grant them strength, ease their difficulties and bring them out of this trial successfully. · Pray that the oppressor be punished. 2. DonateWe urge you to donate generously. Your donations will help us provide necessary humanitarian relief to the affected needy families and refugees through the services of accredited and experienced international Muslim relief agencies. 3. Educate & communicate Spread the word to and discuss the problem with Muslims and non-Muslims. Discuss the Chechen point of view and the right of the Chechen people to live in peace. Share the atrocities committed by the invading forces of the Russian army.Statement of Mujahideen Leadership from Grozny All Praise is to Allah. Prayers and blessings are upon His Messenger.Firstly: We thank all of our Muslim brethren everywhere who are with us in heart and spirit. The ones who provide us with supplications and support which undoubtedly affect the course of fighting.Secondly: We want to assure all the brethren that our current military situation is good and there is nothing to worry about. We are happy to inform them that the Mujahideen have stood up to many fierce Russian Army attacks. The current state of the Russian military is that of desperation and confusion. Care about civilian life is all but gone. The Russian Army forces started using ultra heavy artillery (1+ Tons) in the bombardment. The indiscriminate bombardment caused major losses among the unarmed civilians and huge destruction to the capital. Regarding the statement that the "Mujahideen should not sacrifice all for the sake of non-strategic towns for life is more valuable that land". As we previously stated, yes, we completely support this statement. We did not declare Jihad except to comply with the orders of Allah. We travel the path that pleases Allah. However, the reason we continue to defend the capital, which is of no strategic value to the Mujahideen, is that we wanted to prove to the world and the Russian Political and Military establishment that despite the size, power, or technology of an enemy, there is no way that they could defeat the people of belief, principle, and land. By protecting the capital for this long, we have broken the arrogance of the Russian Army and politicians. We caused them tremendous damage and broken the spirits of their soldiers and officers. This alone is considered a victory. We also repeatedly humiliated the Russian military leadership, who on many occasions, promised dates of entering the capital. The last of which was the first of January. Yet, to this date, they have not succeeded. Putin promised the world that the Russian flag would be waiving in Grozny by the beginning of the year. So, where are those flags of yours, Mr. Putin? Due to this failure, his credibility has plummeted among the Russian leadership. The ones who are anxiously waiting for something to happen so that they can save face in front of the world. By maintaining the capital we've obviously embarrassed them. This has resulted in the politicians loosing faith in their own military. The military whose defeats date back to Afghanistan, where they left humiliated.Thirdly: As we convey these points to our brethren, we have to bring their attention to an extremely important matter; When we made the decision to protect the capital, the ultimate goal of protecting the Religion, civilian life, and the Mujahideen did not escape our minds. When we contemplate a decision, we do our very best to base the final decision by weighing the pros and cons. Everyday, we continue to judge the benefits and prices resulting in maintaining the decision. We will ultimately continue what we believe pleases Allah and has benefits to the religion and Muslims regardless of the cost. If this results in leaving the capital, we will. We are not better than the companions fighting in the battle of Badr when they left Mu`tah. When Khalid led the Muslims in their departure, the messenger, prayers and blessings be upon him, was happy and considered it a victory. On the other hand, if we need to stay and protect the capital, then our best example is the Messenger of Allah, prayers and blessings are upon him. He believed in the victory and the promise of Allah where he -peace and blessings be upon him- led 300 men in fighting 1000 who also exceeded them in weaponry. As a result, regardless whether we go with the first or second option, our Religion is kind and merciful. Praise is to Allah who did not make our Religion difficult. This leaves us with the remaining variables, which are monetary, military, and political. The leaders in charge of defending the capital know the most about the variables and therefore are best to evaluate the situation. Thus, we want to ensure our brethren that we will not stop supporting what we believe is best for religion, life, and the Muslims. We continuously ask Allah and request that our brothers ask Allah to guide us to what is best for our religion and life. Finally: We request and urge all Muslims to stop listening to and ignore all Russian Political establishment’s propaganda and the western media who try to strengthen the spirits of the Russian Army with lies and fabrications of victories that never took place. If we decide to leave the capital, we will announce it via our own official sources. We ask Allah to raise his religion, grant victory to his supporters, and bestow defeat upon his enemy. Allah knows best and prayers and blessings are upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and all of his companions. Six Points Action Plan Recommended to the Muslims Worldwide1. Follow the authentic news of the Jihad in Chechnya from authentic sources. 2. Spread authentic news about what is happening in Chechnya to Muslims all over the world, through word-of-mouth, Friday sermons, leaflets, posters, friends in the Muslim and non-Muslim media, radio, TV, e-mail and the Internet. Media is an important part of this war.3. Boycott Russian companies and goods. Enforce all types of sanctions against Russia. 4. For the one who is able, to travel to Chechnya to give physical and financial assistance to their suffering Muslim brothers and sisters. One should NOT travel to Chechnya until he has definite contacts with Chechen groups, organizations, and centers or Islamic charitable organizations, which can confirm 100% that a safe route exists into Chechnya. All visas must be obtained prior to travel. Once inside Chechnya, one must join one of the many existing groups helping the afflicted Muslims in the area. 5. Lobby relatives, friends and contacts in Muslim governments to break off diplomatic relations with Russia, expel their ambassadors and shutdown their embassies, unless Russian unilaterally withdraws from Chechen soil. 6. At the very least, supplicate to Allah to give Victory to the believers and destroy the oppressors.THE CHRONOLOGY OF CHECHNYA-RUSSIA CONFLICT1. In 1864, Chechens, after a long and bloody struggle for freedom, surrendered to Tsarist Russia. 2. In 1877, Chechens rose up in arms against Russia but were subdued. 3. In 1901, about 700 families migrated from Chechenya to Turkey. Of this group, about 200 families returned to Chechenya, while 300 families settled in Turkey and 200 families settled in Jordan. 4. After WWI, the political and nationalist activists of the Republic of the North Caucasus Federation moved to Poland to escape Communist oppression. Upon signing the agreement, by Hitler and Stalin, to divide Poland between Nazi Germany and Russia these activists moved to France where their descendents live today. 5. After WWII, Chechen members of the Red Army who were prisoners of war in Nazi Germany refused to return to Chechenya since the Chechen nation had already been exiled in 1944 to Siberia by Stalin. These Chechens settled in Germany, Turkey and the U.S.A. 6. On May 11, 1918, the North Caucasus nations declared the formation of the Republic of the North Caucasus Federation. Germany, Ottoman Turkey, Austria, and Bulgaria in addition to Bolshevik Russia recognized this republic. 7. In 1922, in a reversal of its recognition, Bolshevik Russia invaded and occupied the Republic of the North Caucasus Federation. 8. Chechens rebelled against Russia in 1929 and again in 1940. Both times they were subdued in a bloody manner by the communist regime. 9. On Feb 23, 1944, the whole Chechen nation was exiled to Siberia by orders from Stalin. 10. After thirteen years of exile, the remaining Chechens were allowed to return to their ancestral homeland by Khrutchev in 1957. 11. Through the 70's, Soviet Russia treated Grozny (capital of Chechenya) as enemy territory, where nighttime curfews were imposed routinely. 12. On Nov 23 - 25 1990, a national Chechen conference convened in Grozny. The conference included delegates representing all ethnic groups of Chechenya, including Russians and Cossacks. 13. On Nov 25, 1990, the delegates to the conference declared the independence and sovereignty of Chechenya and its cessation from the former Soviet Union. 14. On Nov 27, 1990, the declaration of independence and sovereignty was unanimously ratified by the Soviet Parliament of the Chechen-Ingush Republic. 15. On Oct 27, 1991, in fulfillment of constitutional requirements, a national Chechen referendum was held. The Chechen nation approved the declaration of independence and elected General Dzhokar Dudayev as the first elected president of the independent Chechen Republic by a margin of 84% from among three contenders for presidency. 16. The former Soviet Union was dissolved at midnight Dec 31, 1992. 17. The former Russian Soviet Socialist Republic was dissolved and replaced by the Republic of the Russian Federation upon signing the federation treaty on Mar 13, 1992. 18. By the free will of the Chechen nation, Chechenya did not sign the treaty or join the federation. 19. Dec. 11 1994: Russian troops invade Chechnya with two tank units; the Chechen-war begins without Russia ever declaring war. 20. Aug 1996: Aslan Maskhadov, a former Soviet army officer who led Chechen rebel forces in the war, negotiates a peace agreement with Moscow's Alexander Lebed that provides for the pullout of the Russian troops and postpones an agreement on Chechnya's constitutional status until 2001. 21. Jan. 27, 1997: Aslan Maskhadov clearly wins elections and becomes Prime Minister in Chechnya's separatist government.22. Feb. 12, 1997: Chechnya's new president Aslan Maskhadov takes the oath of office under heavy security, pledging to strengthen the self-proclaimed independence of his Muslim republic. 23. May 12, 1997: Boris Yeltsin and Aslan Maskhadov sign a peace treaty which leaves open the question of independence, but confirms that Russia will acknowledge the norms of international law and not use force to settle disputes. Chechnya keeps the Russian ruble as currency. The treaty also clears the way for commissioned use of Chechyan oil pipelines by Russia.Council of Europe Must Act on Chechnya(Strasbourg, January 25, 2000)--Human Rights Watch today called on European parliamentarians meeting in Strasbourg to take a tough stand on Russia's war in Chechnya. "The Council of Europe's top priority must be getting a sustained international monitoring presence in Ingushetia," said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's representative in the northern Caucasus, who traveled to Strasbourg to press his case with members of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly holding their quarterly meeting this week. "Having people from the international community on the ground to bear witness to what is happening is the best means of getting some immediate relief. If the Russian Federation is serious about living up to its commitments to the Council of Europe, it must agree to such scrutiny."Rape Allegations Surface in Chechnya(Nazran, January 20, 2000)--Russian soldiers have been raping Chechen women in areas of Russian-controlled Chechnya, Human Rights Watch charged today. A team of Human Rights Watch investigators in Ingushetia has spoken to a number of Chechen refugees who saw the bodies of victims, or had conversations with women who had been raped."Rape is a war crime, and these allegations about rape in Chechnya are very serious," said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. She stressed that according to international law, any single rape could be a war crime.Human Rights Watch researchers in southern Russia have learned that thousands of elderly, poor, and infirm civilians remained trapped in Chechen combat zones. Civilians who have managed to flee the region report that bus drivers, border guards, and corrupt officials are charging exorbitant prices for persons seeking to flee the fighting, forcing the most underprivileged persons to remain behind. They are trapped between Chechen fighters and advancing Russian troops, are unable to escape, and have no access to running water, electricity, heating, or food supply. Most essential services in Grozny and other large towns have ceased functioning."This kind of predatory extortion for compliance with residence permits is bad enough in peacetime as a violation of freedom of movement," commented Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. "But these are helpless civilians fleeing armed conflict. The Russian government has a legal obligation to protect them."A Reminder from Al-Qur'an and SunnahOur beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of discomforts on the day of resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection.” (Sahih Bukhari)“Whatever you spend in the way of Allah, it is for your own good, when you spend not for anybody’s pleasure except that of Allah. Thus whatever you spend for any good work you will get full benefit of it and you will not be wronged to the slightest extent.” (Al-Qur’an 2:272)“And in their wealth have due share of those who ask for help and those who are deprived.” (Al-Qur’an 51:19) him.“Those who spend their property by night and by day, secretly and openly, they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.” (Al-Qur’an 2:274)Brothers and Sisters, both Al-Quran and As-Sunnah have urged us to spend in the cause of Allah (SWT).
