      I have just about had it with this wireless internet bullshit that I got. I spent around $200 to get the router and PC card for my laptop, only to find out that the signal is really only good in the next room away from the router (because of the materials used to build the house I am told). Not to mention when I am lucky enough to get a signal that stays with me for more than 20 minutes, my neighbors have a wireless system in their house, which interferes with mine. Theirs must be better than mine because it keeps booting me off mine somehow. So now that I have spent all that money to get the wireless, I gotta drop around another $100 to get the wired internet and I am stuck with the wireless equipment. Any buyers?

      Ok so I started my new job today and it looks like it's gonna be tough work. I am definitely looking forward to it though, instead of a mindless office job where I sit behind a computer and watch my ass get fatter than it already is. I went out and saw a movie today cuz I just wanted to get out of the house (away from my visiting parents. I needed some alone time I guess you can say). I saw Alien Vs. Predator again. Its a cool movie, but if you saw Freddy Vs. Jason, you will see the ending from a mile away. Don't worry I won't ruin it for anyone. It is still a cool movie though. Hopefully I will get to go see more movies soon with the new job paying much better than the other one. Anyways I kinda tired so I am out for the night.

      These are just a few of the many, many songs that run thru my head on a daily basis:  "I am extraordinary if you ever get to know me. I am extraordinary. I am just your ordinary average everyday sane psycho" -- Liz Phair,  Extraordinary   "When I grow up I'll be stable. When I grow up I'll turn the tables." -- Garbage,  When I Grow Up   "If you still care at all, please don't tell me now. If you love me at all, don't call." Jimmy Eat World,  Your House    to be continued...

      Things are finally falling into place and looking up for me. I finally have friends that are not out to get something outta me (i.e. expensive presents, a reason to talk to someone else, etc.). I have a good paying job and a second job that I really enjoy. I'm finally able to pay my bills on time and in full. Looks like I am going to have some sort of social life. This is the happiest I have been in a very  very  long time. All in all, looking back, I am glad I took the chances I took when I decided to move out here. I'm glad the things that have happened did happen. I look forward to the future now (instead of dreading it, which I used to do). What's the line from Terminator 2? Something like "The future is not set. It is what we make it." Please correct me if I am wrong (which I prolly am). Anyways, I'm headin outtie for now.

      Ok I'm kinda tired right now from lack of sleep, so this is gonna be short. I talked to my brother yesterday and he doesn't sound too good. We only talked for about 10 minutes and he was out of breath. He was released from the hospital and is going back to work tomorrow (crazy workaholic isn't he? Must run in the family because I'm the same way). He, his wife, and their daughter are all coming down in October. I can't wait to see them. Finally someone to drink with! LOL. Anyways, we had the birthday party for Lizzie yesterday. Everyone loved the cake that Amanda (my bestest buddy in the whole world) made. I ended up getting home late from that so I didn't sleep much. Damn telemarketers don't get enough of calling my house phone. They are callin my cell phone now too. Ain't that a bugger. I better get to sleep now so I can get up and be at least functional tomorrow at work.

      Why are there not so many people running around named "Enid" or "Eunice" or "Herbert" anymore?  Why is it that most females (and some males) are afraid of a teenie tiny little spider that isn't even poisonous? C'mon... you are at least 1 million times the size of them. Squish it... and move on.  Does anyone else not have a microwave, but rather have a clock that occasionally cooks shit?  Does anyone else have amnesia and deja vu at the same time?  Has anyone else bought batteries, but they weren't included so they had to buy them again?   And these are the thoughts that keep me up at night.

      Ok so bear with me as I start this up. I talked to my mom yesterday and found out that my brother is in the hospital. He has fluid around his heart and a viral infection, both of which are making it extremely hard and paiful for him to breathe. He'll be alright I know it because he is the kind of guy that does not accept defeat easily. He was training to run in a marathon next month... looks like that plan is finished. My parents are coming out to see the new house tomorrow and they will be here all week. I am enjoying the "desert life" as opposed to Chicago life. Sure it may be hot, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I already have someone out here that I consider a really good friend. I have only known her about a month and a half or so, but she has already shown herself to be a better person and friend than any of my previous friends. I think other people are seeing how well we get along and they are jealous, so they are coming up with crazy ideas, like telling her that I "might be stalking her" and shit like that. How second grade! LOL. Anyways, I hope the friendship lasts for a while.
