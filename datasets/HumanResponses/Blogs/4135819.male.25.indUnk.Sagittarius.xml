      I have decided that I really need to have a Cult of Personality formed around me. Ideally, without the whole megalomaniacal narcissistic psychosis...maybe with just a slightly inflated ego. I mean, I don't need to go renaming the months of the year after myself or having school kids sing songs about me every morning...I'd settle for a poster of me on every corner and people always saying my name with a kind of awed hush.  To be honest its just that I really always like those equine statues from the middle ages and renaissance and its my impression that pretty much everyone that has a cult of personality gets a statues and I'm pretty sure I can ask them to make it a statue of me on a horse. I guess I could also maybe do a Colossus of Rhodes kind of thing, you know, a200 foot tall bronze me looking all imposing and straddling some waterway. The thing is I'm not really sure what waterway I should go on. I live in Manhattan now , so you think Hudson, maybe the east river, but there are alot of really tall buildings in New York so a 200 foot tall me might just kind of blend in and if I was on the Hudson, then me and the statue of Liberty might just look like some weird, oversized wedding cake decoration...so Equine it is.  I also don't even really need to be in charge of a country or anything. Quite frankly I think running a nation, even a small nation and even with an iron fist, requires quite a bit more paper work than I am really ready to deal with. Not to mention the fact that I'd then probably have to be able to remember everyone in the offices name, something I have enough trouble doing anyway, but now there would be the added pressure of some woman coming up to me and saying "Hey how is our Great Lord and Leader Today?" and I'd be like "I'm great Sue, How are you?" but it turns out her name is actually Samantha and then she'd go home and cry all night and come into the office the next day looking all puffy and tired and I'd be like "what's wrong Sue?" and then she'd start crying again, then one of my minions would tell me that her name isn't Sue and then I'd feel all guilty and stuff and probably have to get her flowers or something to make it up to her, but then she'd misinterpret the flowers as some kind of expression of romantic interest and ask me out and I'd have to come up with some lame excuse why I can't go like "Sorry Samantha, I'd love to go out with you tonight, but I need to remoisten all my toads" and then all our interactions in the office would be really awkward for like a month until she finally gets over me, but ends up with some dweeb from ,like, accounting or human resources and then I feel really guilty for making her run to that putz Lawrence.  I'm also thinking that I am going to stay away from any kind of religious overtones or claims that I am a god. As God asked Todd Flanders in the Simpsons "Do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?" I may have my own personality cult, but that doesn't mean that lightning doesn't hurt.  Not to mention the fact that every once in awhile I'd totally have to do the whole vengeful God thing myself and I've actually been having the damnest time causing any plagues lately...the best I've been able to do it give a few people the flu and I once left this guy's window open by mistake and a couple of flies got into his car...But let's face it, if Kim Jong Il publicly insults me on North Korean TV, my peps are gonna be like "He can't do that to you, you should smite him or send some plagues his way" and then all I can do is like cough without covering my mouth or drinking out of the same glass as him...its not really going to work.  All this being said, over the next 3-6 weeks I will be founding a personality cult based on the sheer grandeur that is me. As I have never done this before, outside of that one time in grammar school that really didn't turn out so well, I would appreciate any advice.

       A question:  Who?   But seriously folks, I seem to remember either yourself or Joe Bob (or senior taco as I like to call him) mentioning that you have a blog of some sort. If this is true I was wondering how one goes about getting one, as I have a propensity for writing ludicrous, but occasionally insightful things and feel that I could possibly influence some nerd into buying the widescreen edition of braveheart instead of buying the fullscreen version and not getting the whole picture (I'm not sure if that was a pun, but if it was it was intended)...Incidentally I would likely call any such Blog felonious penguin....also, I think it would be cool if some one in a nunnery who really likes bebop music to start a website called Thelonious Nun

      1. Seeing Mr. Rogers being led out of an apartment building in handcuffs, a jacket hastily throw over his head to try to conceal his identity, after the grizzly discovery of 24 dismembered bodies in The Land Of Make-Believe.  2. Hearing that Panthra from Thunder Cats was recently indited for war crimes under Belgium's controversial law.  3. Seeing Wembley and Boober from Fraggle Rock stumbling drunk down 10th Avenue at 3:00 in the morning with a pair of hookers.  4. Seeing any Smurf naked.  5. Meeting Cookie Monster for a drink one evening and having him tell me that he has had a crush on me for the last 19 years but was never brave enough to tell me aboutnhis true feelings.  6. Seeing a video from a 7-Eleven security camera that shows Mickey Mouse brutally beating the store clerk with the butt end of a shotgun  7. Being told that the tasty burger I had just eaten was not in fact made from beef, but rather from mogwai.  8. Finding out that Snake Eyes was a communist sympathizer.  9. Watching the news as thousands of Bolivians fire guns into the air and cheer the rise of their new dictator, George Jetson.  10. Having a gummy bear gain its super bouncing ability right before I ate it.

      Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get BLOGGED!!!!  Wahoo, a new blog!  Penguins in New York will feature the the rants, raves and assorted rambling of yours truly.  I suppose I will spend most of my time writing on political topics, but I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up commenting a good bit on movies, music, sports and the like.  In case you were wondering, the first blog I really read was Frank J's IMAO. Even though I don't agree with him on everything, its the one blog I am sure to visit everyday (actually usually several times a day) to get some funny, and its my inspiration for starting my own blog. As I understand it is good etiquette, polite, friendly, cordial and a wonderful way of sucking up in the hopes of one day getting a link on someone else's blog, I give you my first link ever:   urlLink  http://www.imao.us    Anywho, I suppose I should get the rock out of here for now and get back to that whole work thing I am supposed to do during the day. In the immortal word of C. Everett Koop: Peace! I'm outta here.
