      I found out yestrday that I have a D+ in math.. I went down. It said in the D range on the interm report, but it stayed there i guess. I told my mom today, and it was hard. I've never gotten below a C in this school.. in the middle school the lowest grade was a C-.. but thats gonna change. Cuz as of next year i'm studying REALLY hard n do my best. I think i've dont real well in trying hard, but that doesnt mean it gets me ne where. my grandfather has pneumonia. I think he gave me a sore throat, cuz before he was sick and it turned into pneumonia. instead of leaving tommorow they're leaving saturday morning.. cuz he's got oxygen n everything. ne way, g2g. ttyl.

      Hey people. I know it's been a lil while since the last time I wrote. Like an hour or two I got back from Karen and Heather's house. I slept over last night after the piano recital. It was surprisingly small, I thought that I was going to be playing infront of like 100's of people, but there was maybe fifty people there. At Karen's house we chilled n Dan and Wally came over. That left me on Heather's bed to sleep. I hope I find someone some day.. soon damnit. lol. I do have someone in mind, but i dont know if it's gonna happen. Oh, and no its not Phil, Luke or Randy or anyone you may know of... they live out of this town. I hate this town. So anyway.  Tuesday night my grandparents came. So far we havent really done much except "chilled". Well they have seen some people whom they are related to that live up here. Tommorow we're suppose to have a barbeque but I dont know who is coming. My brother came over today to see them, but they went to see some family and they wont be back until about eight.   Oh, at Karen and Heather's house I bought a soft "Angel" pink purse, a  Playboy  necklace and a LAZER... omg.. those things are so much fun.. lol. I love blinding people with it... muah hah hah! Did that sound saitanic? lol. I'm just messin. Anyway, I got to go. Talk to you later.

      Hey ppl. Today is Monday.. meaning there was school. I hate it... lol. When I first got home I had to feed my rabbit, and than I had a snack... lol. Right after that I began doing homework. I have a history test tommorow, a french ditto due tommorow, english make-up to do and I have to fix my child development conclusion because it's not long enough. Thats a lot. Also I worked on the midterm review sheet madame brodie (for french) made us do... we each have 2 different from everyone else's. I got one of them done.. so that I dont have to do all this homework while my grandparents are here...  they're coming tommorow night. I really cant wait until school ends because I hate the chaos of the work and the drama that people have to bring into it. Its like a crappy job, but you dont get payed. Anyway, I've kind of stopped using livejournal.. only because I guess I like this one better. Yes.. that one has moods and a better selection of backrounds but I still like this better. It's more "mature" I guess you could say. Anyway, got to get going. I'm going to TRY to excercise tonight because my hip is feeling a lot better.. but now my wrist hurts from typing so much.. lol. ttyl.

      Hey again. Its me... lol. My hip  still  hurts... a lot. Well after the last entry I ended up doing some homework and than going to bed because I was exhausted. For dinner I ate salad... while the rest of my family ate yummy stuff.. my mom is putting me on a diet. So I only had like half of it cuz it was a disguating salade and than I went in my room and watched tv. I saw the whole season of  Road Rules South Pacific . Than I was hungry cuz I hadnt ate much of my salade so I wanted some cereal. My mom friggin put it up high so I couldnt eat any of it so i resorted to crackers with peanut butter and my dad still bitched at me. This morning I got up at 8... cuz my dad likes to wake me up.. idfk why though... it pisses me off. So than I did like 3 loads of laundry and than ate Oatmeal.. which i hate but my dad made me eat cuz of my new dumb diet. Than i took a shower and fell asleep while watching my brothers play video games. So when I got up i could only eat my fuckin salade but i said screw that and had peanut buttered toast... I was friggin having low blood sugar. So thats where I am as of now, but i'll be sure to update you tommorow about tonight and tommorow.. if that makes sense.. lol.

      Hey people. The past two days has been a bitch. Yestrday when I got home from school all was well. I was suppose to stay after for Big Brother Big sister, but I didnt know that last friday was the last day. So at about 3:30 or so I went to let the dog in the house and I suddenly got a sharp pain in my hip... a  bad pain. The pain stayed and worsened. It was to the point that I couldnt walk... n I know this sounds gross but it took me a friggin half an hour to get in and out of the bathroom... it hurt that bad. I couldnt bend or do anything. Sitting down hurt, laying down hurt and walking hurt so basically I always hurt. My mom brought me to the doctors... n all we know now is that it has nothing to do with nerve damage and nothings broken. However I may have an infection from my back surgerys I had a few years ago.. when I had rods put in.. but I'll pray that thats not the case.. even though I'm not that religous...lol. So I got home and ended up falling asleep on my bed while watching tv... and I woke up in pain... again and it made it difficult for me to fall back asleep and than i had to go to the bathroom again.. Damn urine... lol. So I ended up falling back asleep again, and when I got up at about 8... i still fuckin hurt. So I ate breakfast and just tried to relax as much as I could. Anyway, hope my back feels better and that for once i figure out to use this damn thing... lol.

       I have transferred myself from livejournal to blog, though I will use livejournal from time to time.  Today was interesting. I had a pretty good day at school, and than after school I had piano lessons which where a bitch because I have a recital coming up which I hope that you all can come to. I'm really nervous because my grandparents from Arizona are going to see it, they're coming the 8th. After that we picked  up Michelle.. Hayes and she came home with us. We had chinese food at my house... yum and than "studied for a french test" meaning listened to music and chilled out and watched a movie. She left a few minuets ago.. so now I'm here. I'm bored as frig... damn her for leaving... lol.. love ya Michelle... lol. Well, there is not much else to say, and I have to take a shower and chill cuz tonight I'm gonna watch a special episode of  Real World San Diego  because I believe that Frankie is leaving... (thank God), and I want to see the results. So, talk to you all later.

          Hey all. I'm here again. The last days of school had gone alright.. I bombed on some of my finals, and ended up doing ALRIGHT for my final grades. Math was the worst.. obviously. I ended up with a C-... yuch. I'm not going to say that next year I'm going to get honors next year, because I said that last summer and I totally screwed myself over. I'm going to work my hardest. I think one of my main problems was that I procrastinated too much. So next year instead of doing my homework after dinner I'm going to do it soon after I get home from school so it's over and done with. I hope that I'm going to have friends in my classes and during lunch. I dont know what I'd do if I didnt have some of my friends in my lunch wave. Anyway... out of the school subject...           The Saturday after school ended my immediate family and I went up to Milton New Hampshire and rented a cottage along the lake with my cousin Sean, his mom named Gerri and her mom named Rose... confusing enough??? lol. Anyway the first night I guess my aunt and her mom had an argument because supposidly Rose started throwing things at Gerri in fustration because I guess she didnt know that she was going to come up to New Hampshire... she's really old... I mean  REALLY  old. So anyway that next morning they left, still leaving Sean which was good because I no longer had to sleep on a mattress along the dining area. I got their room which was right across from a bathroom but it didnt have a damn shower. So on that trip we went swimming. I got a slight tan, unlike some fat ass people who decide to get a fake tan at a salon instead of getting off their tub of lard... Also we fished and I caught a baby bass, well it was small anyway and a few sun fish and leaves and a branch off a small tree. It is soo gross when you try to get the worm onto the hook because it can bleed and it still moves while it's on the hook. Crawlers are the worst because they bleed and puss everywhere...             So other than that live has been normal. I haven't really done much except I went to Andrea's house to sleep over two days before going to New hampshire.. or the night before that... I dont know... lol.I have basically just chilled out. Oh, and I'm hopefully getting a Samsung flip phone that has a camera built in it or what not. It's like 70$ though, but it's buy one get one free so my mom can get one. So talk to you later.
