      My name is Jane and I live in the UK. I am 42 and i sometimes wonder what i have achieved with my life up to now.   Well I became an accountant, been married twice, had 2 kids and a Jack Russell. Sounds simple at this point but with days like today, I do wonder. Apart from my children, life sometimes does not seem worth living. I bet this sounds like everyone elses musings on these blogs but i have got to a point where if i don't say something, i will drown in my own self-pity.  I have lived in the same city all my life and was born to parents who are still together. My father was a solicitor and my mother was a nurse. they had the sort of marriage that meant my mother gave up working when she was pregnant with me (i'm the eldest) and she never really had to work again.  I have a sister and a brother and you know the saying "two's company and three's a crowd" well that applies to my siblings and I. Always was the odd one out. They even live in the same village in Surrey even though thats not where we come from. Oh well, i suppose you eventually get used to the fact that you will always be the one who is on their own.  Not that I have yet. Oh well another musing soon.

      Typical, saturdaymorning and I am awake earlier than I normally am to get up for work. well at least I have put the time to good use and I must get these cushions made for my mum. They are driving me mad but by the time I get home in the evening, I am just too tired. Too much work, not enough money, oh well on with the sewing!

      So its been ages since I added to the blog, i hoped it would be a sort of daily thing but it has turned out to be anything but that.  I realise that i really need to move on with my life. Looking back in the past all the time really doesn't do me any good at all.  There are various things that I need to sort out in my life  1. My weight - I allow it to run my life and stop me doing stuff or maybe its the reason why i don't lose weight, then I don't have to do anything and life can run along in its own sweet way. there is some comfort in being stuck in the same old rut day afetr day, week after week and month after month. It allows me to continue the myth that being fat means that I am also stupid, which I know I am not but Its a label and it has sorta stuck with me and I have seriously got the point where i nearly believe it.  2. My work - I had to change jobs in January as I was made redundant as the company closed and I should be grateful because I was offered a job, but it was less pay but I have 2 kids to keep so I have to be sensible about it. They come first and it isn't just me that lives in this house. this new job has made me realise though that there are some nice places to work. I only do it part-time but I really would like to work there full-time. I do however have another part-time job which is driving me nuts but due to the fact thatI need the money and that I hate confrontation, I have done nothing about asking, after all the worst they could say is no!
