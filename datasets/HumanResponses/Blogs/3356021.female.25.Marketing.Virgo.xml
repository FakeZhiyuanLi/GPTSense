      Have you ever felt a butterfly flying in your stomach? They said it was the feelings when you’re in love.  Last nite, a friend told me that she felt those butterflies feelings in her stomach again. I was glad, coz that meant she’s falling in love with someone. Although, it might sounds a little bit weird (or not, whatever), I’ve never felt such a thing. Or, I’ve felt it once, but I hardly recognized it, and then forget about it. So, I am now wondering how that things felt like. Is it going to be an addiction? Might be; as long as I’m not gonna feel trapped inside it. It’s the feeling that one must preserve.  So, I am now wondering how that butterfly in my stomach felt like. And therefore I should get in love. But since when falling in love has to be forced away? Well, I guess I’ll feel it someday. Yeah, keep being optimistic, that’s the thing that keep me alive and stand up straight in this fuckin’ celibacy world.

      How many times does good romance come knocking on our door? How many people are lucky enough in life to actually meet other people they can feel comfortable being with? How many of us here have had the luxury of knowing the few people in this universe that can 'click' with us the very minute we sit and talk to them?  I think it all depends on how much you appreciate those who step into your life, therefore making it more meaningful to live it. And when you put romance in the picture, I personally believe that it's something we cannot seek. It just comes, sometimes at the least expected moment, catching us off guard. We might even not be aware of it when we see it right under our very nose, but that is really where the beauty of it lies. Being able to grab the moment and seizing it takes a lot of courage.  I believe that i have to have a big enough heart and perfect clarity of mind to be able to pull off such a thing, 'coz you know what, it might not come again. It's rare, to be able to find someone, that one unique someone, in life. The kind of someone that appreciates you for what you are and not for whom they want you to be. You can control a lot of things in life, that's true, but feelings? Nah, I don't think you can control or stop them from coming. It's one of the things that make us 'human'. And when you do this, contain your feelings, from that certain someone in your life; he/she might not stick around to wait for you. When the moment comes that you think you're ready, he/she might be long gone from your life. Just like good opportunities, that right and perfect someone is also a rare thing. You can't go out into the dark of the night and seek 'good romance'. It always comes uninvited. I wonder whether I'd be able to recognize it when it comes knocking on my door.

      Just yesterday I went into a mall, and stop by at a small shop.  There I looked through some stuff, and the waitress came and gave me assistance. After a bit of a chit chat, she asked me: “Are you come here alone, Miss?” I said “ Yes, I am.” Then she gave me this look, the look of pity and out of her curiosity, she asked me again: “Well, why? It’s a Saturday night, and a girl like you shouldn’t be alone out here walking by yourself.”   For a moment I just stood and looked at her face, trying to say many things that came across my mind once she said that, but in the end I just smiled at her, and say: “Well, I don’t see anything wrong with that, Miss.” I think she’s a bit embarrassed, and put my things altogether in a hurry. I walked out of that shop feeling upset, because no matter how I stand on my opinion that it’s alright to anyone for being single, most people just couldn’t accept that. Even my friends insisted me to find a boyfriend like in a hurry, otherwise I’ll end up alone for the rest of my life (okay, the otherwise part was not what they were really said, but it’s the impressions I got when they started to mention it). Some of them even said that I took care of my heart a little TOO careful. In other words, I didn’t have the guts to even try falling in love. Well, guess what, I’ve been in love for several times, and it was never been any good at the end, so in this period of time, I did ask for a little time to enjoy my life at being single. I know it’s never been always felt good at being single, there’s the time when I feel alone when I couldn’t find my friends or family whom I can talk to. But most of the time, I could always find them beside me. Wasn’t the same thing happened when having a boyfriend? He couldn’t always be there at my side in instance whenever you need him, right? What, are we dating a Superman or something? Well, I have a story, once upon a time a friend of mine got broke up on her 4th year relationship, and she felt liberated. Another friend then asked her a question, which to us was ridiculously funny, “Don’t you worry of being lonely?” To us, that question was surprising because we didn’t think we could ever get lonely in this life as long as we have a family and some very good buddy that could give you accompany and lift you up when you’re feeling down.  So there, you were asked by the question, and you’ve answer that question to her brilliantly, and now why do you have to ask me the same question? You know I would answer the same thing. And in additions, I do enjoy my single life; I’m not rushing to find another boyfriend as soon as possible after breakups.  And speaking of being a little TOO care of my heart, I knew that everything that is too much was never been any good. But was it wrong to have another way of seeking a boyfriend? Maybe I’m not like most of my friends who could easily find a boyfriend in an instant. Well, I just couldn’t do that. I have to get to know him well, before I decided him to be a boyfriend with. Isn’t it a bit freaky when you’re dating someone you absolutely have no idea with?  Sometimes, I was like in the middle of an intersection. Left turn, is the way to a single life, liberating, fun and amusing, but also depressing when knowing how others may think or feel about your single situation, especially your significant others.  Right turn, is the way of what everybody wants, is the happily ever after relationship, with all the efforts and other things you have to sacrifice.  Oh, have I mention that the intersection was jammed? Yes, it was. There are lots of cars behind me, beside me, all over me, that keep blowing their horns and yelled, rushing me to make a turn, any turn at all. And there I was, standing in the middle of that jammed intersection, haven’t decided which turn I will make, and somebody feeling very clever asked me this question: “So, when will you get married?” OMG, haven’t I got enough horns blowing in my ears already? The thing was, when my friends start joking around about why I was so freak out about marriage, I was always fail to make them understand, that it was never the marriage or the commitment I’m afraid of. It’s just, I’m in the middle of that jammed intersection, which I’m sure they will never understand what I’m talking about.  Oh dear, why this thing had become very depressing already? The simple and easy answer is there already, and everybody knows it, have a boyfriend. But that’s not really what I want. What I want is, for everybody that I care and cared for me, to be willing to accept every choice I made, even though it’s to live single happily ever after.
