      i just remembered this and it made me laugh to myself---just like it did the first time... my mom retired this year.  she taught and was in the same school district that i went through school in so at the party i recognized a lot of the teachers.  this was strange for me as i was never that great in school and feared someone might recognize me and tell me some story about something i may have done in class...this didn't happen though.  the party was a big dinner and award ceremony.  the teachers were all to receive a little statuette for their years of service...anyway.  we(my mom, sister and myself) were seated at a table with very uptight people.  the whole night was stiff and uncomfortable.  i needed something to relieve the tension.  that's when desert came out.  the school's colors were orange and black so the restaurant had made individual cakes and frosted them alternately in, of course, orange and black.  i had an orange cake.  my mom and sister had black and so did half of the room of teachers.  we were one of the first tables served and we dug right in.  everyone was complimenting the cake and i looked up--the people with the black frosted cakes had black and blues mouths.  their teeth and lips--all of them were black and blue.  i see all these people all prim and proper with their black teeth and just burst out laughing.  i couldn't contain myself.  this dinner that was all serious and whatever--and everyone had these dyed lips/teeth.  i found it far too funny and had to hold the napkin in front of my face for the longest time so i caould get all the laughing out.  people keep lookin to the person next to them to check if their mouth was dyed.  it was really funny...

      if you live in minnesota and you haven't been to franconia sculpture park yet--you really should go.  jesse and i met a bunch of friends there on saturday before we headed to st. croix falls.  it was the first time going there for most of them and all of us had just a blast. the best is this sculpture of two cars doggie style.  there is this music playing from one of the cars and everything is visible through the windshield... canoeing was great.  the best part is that you can get really lazy about it if you want.  the current takes you down the river, you really just have to steer to stay off the banks.  the st. croix has a lot of little islands and sand bars to pull off on.  we found a nice spot to stop and lit the grills and had one of the best bar-b-ques i have had.  everyone brought great food.  we played frisbee, drank, layed around...it was so relaxing.

      i work at a design/sculpture studio in st. paul,mn.  st. paul was the childhood home of mr. charles m. schulz. so for the past five years we have made sculptures of different peanuts characters to honor him.  snoopy, charlie brown, lucy, linus and this year snoopy on his doghouse with woodstock.  this is my first year here and so i haven't had the full experience of this project before.  my mother was (she just retired this year) a school teacher and loves these sculptures.  she makes posters of all the sculptures for her classroom and the kids, well, they just love them.  there are usually just over one hundred of them made and local artists submit designs and are chosen to paint them.  they really are a big hit.  we have one in fron of our studio that the owners of the company--who are probably the nicest people i have ever met, by the way, designed and had our artists paint.  it has a different season on each side and was all airbrushed.  it is pretty.  we were late putting it on the sidewalk and we had lots of people calling asking where it was.  well, it's finally out there and you wouldn't believe the number of people we have coming to take pictures of it. all day, there are people out there.  it's good people watching.  yesterday there was this couple out there and they had on their matching snoopy t-shirts.  funny.  but the people, they love these things.  they go crazy about them.  they are spread out all over the city--like the cows that chicago made years back.  but it is fun.  having people out looking for them and talking about their favorite peanuts characters and whatever.  peanuts was drawn for fifty years so people have a lot of memories of it.  and it was so simple that everyone could relate.  we even have had tour groups from japan come to look at the sculptures.  it is a cool thing to be a part of.

      jesse and i went out for our date last night but it didn't quite turn out as planned.  his sister works at this great restaurant and she was going to serve us.  she was cut early and decided to join us for dinner and then some of our friends showed up and we eneded up meeting them in the bar after we ate.  so it turned into more of a going out rather than a date.  i was pretty tired though and i found myself straining to make conversation.   i am normally a shy person.  it's strange--for as much as i have been around jesse's sister i am still shy with her.  since jesse is the complete opposite--he could talk to a wall and have the wall laughing within five minutes, he was getting really annoyed with me.  i don't know why i get that way.  i just get really tense and nervous around people sometimes.  i never feel like myself around most people.  if it is someone who i have known for a long time and have had some good conversations with, i am okay.  but if i try to meet new people or even if i am around people i don't know well--i get all stiff and stuffy and tense.  i hate that it happens and i have been thinking about going on medication because of it.  i am just a little scared about that.  but it sure ain't easy being around people...

      work is so boring today and my lack of sleep is catching up with me.  one of those days i wish i could crawl under my desk and take a nap.  or better yet, go to a nice grassy spot, lay down a blanket and fall asleep while trying to decipher what the clouds resemble.  no nap for me today though--i have a hot date with my boyfriend.  we are going to a tapas restaurant that serves great food, great drinks and the best fresh-made-daily ice cream.  last time we were there we had roasted banana, cream cheese and strawberry.  it was delicious.  i am hoping i can muster some energy before we go so i am not a complete bore while we are out.  no one likes a date who yawns the whole time.  when will they finally find a cure for the need to sleep?

      the weather around the counrty reached new highs for spring.  not minnesota.  we have had rain and clouds nearly everyday of spring and it seems that it might carry through to summer as well.  i have come to realize that i am a person who relies on the sun for my mental well-being.  it has been so cloudy and chilly here that the lakes are still far too cold to go swimming in and it's already officially summer.i need sunshine. i want to buy an ice cream cone and have it melt before i can eat it all.  the other day i bought one and sill haven't finished it.  i just set it outside for later. the part that gets me the maddest is that the fourth is coming up soon and that is when we go to our friend sean's cabin.  it has become tradition for jesse and me. it's a great cabin on long lake in wisc. and they have everything you need for the true cabin experience.  boats and fishing poles, jet skies, a floating swimming platform, dogs that run around all over.  the family really gets into fireworks too.  bob (the dad) always buys hundreds and hundreds of dollars on fireworks each year. we all hop in the boats to go see the local display--then head back of rour own.  honestly it is better than the town's.  the point i am trying to make is that there will  be no jet skiing this year, no swimming.  we'll probably all be running aroung in our wool sweaters and long underwear.  it's cold for summer.

      i was looking at a blog today and the author was talking about someone on her life who was very judgemental.&nbsp; i have someone in my life like that also and i only recently realized how deeply it can effect a person.&nbsp;   my mother is that way--judges everything i do.&nbsp; always makes me feel like i am not good enough.&nbsp; that i don't work hard enough.&nbsp; that i am just , and this is a quote, "rotten".&nbsp; i do realize that i have made my misatkes.&nbsp; everyone does.&nbsp; but my mom's love is conditional&nbsp;and that&nbsp;makes making mistakes very hard.&nbsp; recently jesse was diagnosed with diabetes.&nbsp; he has to take insulin and at first he didn't have the correct dosage.&nbsp; he felt tired all the time and flu-like.&nbsp; he was having a hard time dealing with the diagnosis and also feeling somewhat depressed.&nbsp; so he was at home one day (right now we are staying with my mom) and my mom wakes him up and tells him that he needs to get out of bed and get over having diabetes.&nbsp; that he is not the first person to be daignosed and that he just needs to get over it.&nbsp; she is screaming at him... she's done this sort of thing to me too.&nbsp;  jesse tells me about this and i decided it's best we lay low for a little while and let her calm down.&nbsp; after a few days i talk to her about what happened.&nbsp; she starts telling me what all her friends tell her about their diabetes and about their kids' diabetes and what ever, so now my mother is the know-it-all of diabetes.&nbsp;she insists that he needs to be on a routine and that she needs to be in cahrge of the routine and she has decided what would be best for jesse and not his doctors.&nbsp; as i tell her that maybe she could find a different way of helping him--she tells me she will--that she just won't do anything. now this to me doesn't seem very mature for a 59 year old lady.&nbsp; she has this i-will-help-you-if-you-do-everything-my-way-or-i-won't-help-you-at-all attitude.&nbsp; it sucks!  i have realized&nbsp;that she has effected me in this way--i always feel inferior.&nbsp; i am always looking for praise and approval.&nbsp; i never feel fully comfortable around people--i am always nervous they won't think i am_______ enough.&nbsp; and i&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes exhibit the same behavior.&nbsp; i&nbsp;can get judgemental.&nbsp; i get jealous.&nbsp;   what i am having trouble with right now is this...she is going through a huge change.&nbsp; she just retired and is having a hard time adjusting.&nbsp; she doesn't like change.&nbsp; and i am having a hard time being sympathetic and understanding and i am having a hard&nbsp; time being around her in general.&nbsp; so what do i do?&nbsp; part of me wants to tell her to get over it--that she is not the first person to retire and to snap out of it.&nbsp; the other part knows to be gentle and understanding.&nbsp; so how do i approach her?

      i still have an hour to kill at work and i have exhausted all other time wasting activities so i decided to write here.&nbsp; as my weekend was fairly uneventful&nbsp; i don't have too much to write.&nbsp; i have had my same cold for almost two weeks now, but i am finally feeling better.&nbsp; i went to the doctor on friday and was prescribed a cough medicine with codeine in it.&nbsp; it is potent and really knocked me on my ass.&nbsp; the weather here couldn't have been more ideal than it was this weekend and i ended up sleeping through most of it.&nbsp; i had hoped to go raspberry picking even, but again, i was sleeping.&nbsp; the season for them is just getting started so there is still a lot of time to get some.&nbsp; one of my favorite memories is going to my aunt's house in the summer and she would send me out with these baskets to pick her some raspberries and i would sit in front of the bushes and eat about five for everyone i put in the basket.&nbsp; it was so nice.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      i have a bad habit of putting in my opinion where it was never asked for.&nbsp; ususally when i do this i wind up looking like an ass.&nbsp; case in point,today.&nbsp; a friend was telling me about his weekend and about this girl he was hanging out with.&nbsp; i was under the impression that something happened when it didn't and i kindof gave him shit because he has a girlfriend.&nbsp; i was wrong about what happened and now i kind of look like a jerk for stepping in.&nbsp; i wish i would learn to look at all the facts before i open my mouth.&nbsp; that would be an important lesson for me...

      my nose itches and my throat is scratchy today.  i would really like to remove them from my body until i feel better as they are driving me really crazy!    work is pretty slow today...  a woman i work with--this really nice and very talented lady--just did the sweetest thing and gave me this magnetic poetry set for the "gardner".  i thought it was so nice of her.  i love gardening and now while i am bored i can come up with poetry about it.    we sent some employees to kansas city today and we got cheap tickets on america west (i think).  my boss was going on about the cookies they serve on the flight.  anybody ever try them?  i could go for chocolate chip cookies right now.    this is me at my bored-est.  it's boring.    i bought some mint tea to try to relieve my nose/throat.  but i haven't made any of it yet.  i should probably do that.    i was quite excited today when i finally got back around to this blog to see that i had a comment.  it's crazy that i would be so excited.  but this is the first time i think i have ever had anyone read something i have written outside of showing them myself.  it felt kind of cool.   i started a new book a little while ago.."Be Here Now".  so far, i really like it.

      so i finally went on sunday to see napoleon dynamite!  i really liked it.  a lot.  a guy i work with said he thought they were trying too hard.  i got mad that he said that.  i don't know what you wouldn't like about that movie.  the characters are great.  i loved them.  the names, the voices, the facial expressions, all of it.  i am still laughing about it.   napoleon...  the time machine...  the uncle...  it was great. so.

      it has finally warmed up a bit in minnesota.  the annuals that we bought have really started to bloom and there is a good chance that i might actually go swimming on the fourth.  today is muggy even.  i was just on a break and i noticed that the arm that hangs out the window when i drive is getting tan.  i am going to have to have jesse take me for one of our long car rides so i can give my other arm a chance to match.  i couldn't be more excited at the idea of summer--i think it has finally arrived!

      i was going through some old pictures last night and i came across one that i had taken of my bedroom.  it was taken about 15 years ago so i was around twelve at the time--maybe 11.  i was really in to posters and always had a lot of them hanging up everywhere.  in the picture i came across were these posters of alf--you remember alf.  that lovable alien from malmac that liked to eat cats...the best poster was of him behind a podium with all these microphones and along the bottom it read "alf for president".  i wish i still had that poster...

      do you ever look back at your blog and cringe? reread all the things you've written and realize that it has totally taken on a context and voice and tone that you didn't want it to take. the thing is that i don't really know at this point what direction i want this to go, but i sure don't like where it was going. i appreciate blogging because it gives me a chance to speak openly without interruptions and i can get a good look at my thoughts. and for someone like me, this is a very good thing. being a classic introvert, i need a place to let it all hang out. this seems to do the trick but i feel like i am still trying to get used to it. i haven't written anything in so long--i am out of practice. i guess i am feeling a little self-conscious about it... so i don't know where this post is going, but i think i just need to give myself a little more time to find my voice again. and i guess this blog could have more benefits than i originally thought. i am excited again!

      minnesotans are not good at small talk.  i have been at countless parties at which i have been in the same room with a group of people all night and will not have met any of them.  i am a lot at fault for that  because i tend to be very shy, but i have heard it from other, more outgoing people as well.  we just don't mingle well.  so today while i was shoping for some flowers, i was amazed when a woman shopping next to me started a conversation about the star gazer lillies we were both admiring.  we taked about how wonderfully fragrant they were and they way the light up a room.  and about how much we both really like them.  it was sweet.  and i know it sounds silly, such a small conversation like that, but she and i went out of our way, out of our own heads and lives and talked with a stranger.

      i was in line at a fast food restaurant the other day and there was a family in the front of the line.  four little kids, dad and mom. a fifth child was ripening in mom's belly.  the total came up and they counted out their money.  tehy were a little short.  they scrambled inside their pockets for change and couldn't come up with any more.  a gentleman in line behind them handed the mom a dollar.  she took it.  didn't say a word and handed it to the employee.  no thanks said, not even a smile.  the gentleman looked a little baffled but didn't get rude.  some people would have been outraged at the lack of appreciation but he just smiled.  i was proud of him.  people won't always say thank you.

      last night on my drive home by the lake i thought i saw a turtle on the road.  i nearly hit it  and so did the car behind me.  fearful that this turtle wouldn't make it if left on the road i turned around to move him/her.  as i pulled to the shoulder of the road, i noticed another car slowing down to do the same thing i was about to do.  "how nice", i thought.  "these little guys are sure well looked after.  i think it's great that people take the time to slow down and help other's out."  as i looked back to the turtle i realized, it wasn't a turtle.  it was a dead crow that looked like the profile of a turtle.  i pulled back onto the road and finished the rest of my drive home.  we tried.  the compassion and concern was there.  and people do care.  just not about dead crows on a busy road...

      as i was thinking about this blog, i remembered a story i heard about on oprah once that always has stuck with me.&nbsp; the subject of the show was something like "unlikely friends".&nbsp; it is a story about two women from opposite ends of the world and how they met.&nbsp; now i am not a great story teller, as most people who know me will tell you, but bear with me because this is a really amazing story.  &nbsp;  a woman in new mexico was reading the newspaper one day and came across a story about a man in south africa who's was brutally murdered by his boss.&nbsp;&nbsp; the man who was murdered had called his wife to tell her that his boss had invited him out for a drink.&nbsp; the woman thought it seemed odd that his boss would do that, but couldn't really stop him from going.&nbsp; the boss was a white man and the man murdered was black.&nbsp; the murder was racially charged.&nbsp; the man was dragged behind his boss' truck.&nbsp; the same thing happened here in texas.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  the woman in new mexico was so touched by this story and felt so horrible that something like that happened again, that she felt she had to do something.&nbsp; she wrote to the widow in south africa.&nbsp; she didn't even know the woman's address there, she just knew the woman's name and the town she was from.&nbsp; her letter expressed how sorry she was for the family and how much she was affected by this murder.&nbsp; the letter found it's was to the widow, who was so touched that this white woman from america would go out of her way to write to her, that she wrote one back.&nbsp; this went on for quite some time.&nbsp; the two became very close through their letters.&nbsp; but they never had met.&nbsp; the widow explained that she was having to work to support her two sons and had just lost her job.&nbsp; she no longer had any income to support her family.&nbsp; the woman in new mexico, who cleaned houses for a living and had little to spare herself, decided to start sending $100 a month to the family.&nbsp; this was actually equilivent to the wage the widow made at her job.&nbsp; neither of them could believe what an incredible thing had happened between them.&nbsp; two perfect strangers from far away places becoming such close friends and able to help each other out from so far away.&nbsp; it was really touching.&nbsp; the way the world could close in just like that.&nbsp; that two people didn't even have to meet to become friends.&nbsp; i found this story to be one of the most incredible i have ever heard.&nbsp; i think about those two a lot and how much one life can touch another.&nbsp; it was really beautiful.

      i have meant to use this blog as a reminder to me that people aren't the clueless,  shallow, void, arrogant, souless creatures we hear about daily in the news, watch on television,  and even encounter in our day to day lives.&nbsp; what is happening to us?&nbsp; why aren't we more mindful people?&nbsp;  the fact that i don't note things in here daily, though, doesn't mean that i don't witness daily acts that remind me of the better qualities that we human's possess.&nbsp; people can be suprising.&nbsp; i hope that other people can add to this and tell me of things that they see people doing that reminds themn that we are okay beings.&nbsp; that there is still hope that we aren't just concerned with who paris hilton is sleeping with or where the new ikea is opening.&nbsp; that there is more substance to us than that...

      we were invited to a friend's cabin for the 4th.  we have been going there for the past couple of years and it is becoming an eagerly anticipated event for us.  this would be the last year at this cabin though, as our friend is selling it.  not to worry though, the plans are to find a new one.  anyway, this really is one of the funnest weekends of the year for us but this year when the time came we really didn't have enough money and told our friend that we would have to back out.  word of our backing out got back to another friend who was going as well.  he is not one to call us normally so it was strange to see his number popping up on our phone.  we listened to the messages we had and the one from him was one of the kindest messages i have heard and actually made me a little teary eyed...."you guys have to come to the cabin.  you won't need money.  we just went to the store and bought food for everyone and plenty of beer.  we even have fireworks.  we all really want you up there..."   for some reason the fact that he went out of his way to help us out really floored me.  the friends we have are great, but a lot of them wouldn't ever think of helping out or being there for you  when you need it.  a lot of them would just not think of it.    but it felt really good to have someone say--we like you.  we want you around.  just bring yourselves and we'll do the rest.  you won't need anything else.  just you...

      the other day jesse was at a gas station pumping some gas when a guy came up to him, out of nowhere and asks, "so how's your day going?". even jesse, being an outgoing guy himself, was surprised by the man's casualness. he told the man that he was doing well and noticed the man had on a vet's jacket and hat. jesse asked the man if he was a vet and the man said he was. jesse reached out his to shake the man's and told him thank you. the man just kind of nodded his head and walked away, but was obviously touched at jesse's gratitude. i have a couple of friends who serve in the military. uncles who served in vietnam. a neighbor who has just been called to service for up to two years, leaving behind a wife and two kids. and as much as i don't like the military, i have a lot of respect for the people who volunteer themselves to fight for us. and i have a lot of respect for those who had no choice but to fight for us. they have put their lives on the line to ensure certain rights and freedoms for us and others. at this year's 4th of July fireworks, taps was played. the emcee asked us to remember those who have given their lives for this country.  it brought me to tears to think of them... thank you to all you vets and god bless you.
