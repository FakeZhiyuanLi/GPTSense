            The word is "focus"....so said my Sir..."to crack that highly competitive exam called CAT, all u need is a right blend of focus and the will to achieve the end"....the words echoed in my ears long after i left class ...highly motivated , i decided to give myself the start ... & hatched upon the plan to improve my calculation speed immensely( that is a prerequisite to do well in the Quants Section).... "focus and will!!!"....    .... after the tiring day at office , i wasn't tired enough to give up on my plans...my friend offered to drop me back home on his bike....&amp; now for the equipments .... a huge plank of thermocol, a double sided tape and a pack of board pins ... when i hugged that plank as i sat on the bike and he doubled his speed to escape the looks of all the passers-by , i realised that i was the object of all those smiles & a few loud laughters around ....&amp; i also realised that i would never again get the offer of being dropped back home .... for "focus and will"!!!...    ....once home, diligently i set up the plank against the wall with the tape ....wrote down the tables of all possible numbers the plank could support and pinned them all up .... it really looked like the notice board , or rather the huge flash card ...my aid to memory !!!... i congratulated myself!!!.... a glance out there on the notice board every morning ...& i am the master of all calculations .... tomorrow morning is the start ...    .... i woke up from the most wonderful dream of having cracked CAT .... &amp; i stared at the empty notice board on the wall ....the empty "focus" for my eyes!!!... it had rained all night , the wind blew strong , the board pins defied me & the papers refused to stay pinned ...&amp; in their declaration to freedom they had flown out of the window into the puddle of water that had accumulated in my verandah due to improper drainage....i stared.... into that puddle of "focus and will"....

      ...its not that i take to writing only when i am down...and, i am not here to prove my statement...  ...i had recently discovered my inspiration... ...like every sunday morning, i had walked into class with sleepy eyes( u know from my previous posting wat i attend class for!)...& then one look at the guy at the board , all set to flaunt his knowledge to a class all eager to give audience to his flaunting endeavour...that was my new teacher of quantitative ability &amp; he drove my sleep away...waking up on Sunday mornings weren't difficult anymore...& the branded "late kate" was the first to get to class ...how i wished my looks would matter more than my brains... coz my brains defied me exactly at those times when sir gave a difficult problem to solve...i slogged hard , but then everytime someone had the answer before me...  ...but my "focus" stayed ....&amp; one fine day i succeeded in being the first to answer... i was immediately rewarded with an enquiry into my name from the most handsome and the most intelligent guy on earth...that took me to seventh heavens... i worked harder...&amp; it payed .... more enquiries followed...i rose to cloud nine...  ....i worked so hard i fell sick...the fever prevented me from getting up  that Sunday morning... ....that was Sir's  last class !
