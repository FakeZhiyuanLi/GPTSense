       M o o d : d e e p l y  d e p r e s s e d         Sorry that I did not  continue  to Blog yesterday, because after that " talk ",  exXxe  and [ her ] are not friends anymore. No more. We argued and sort of quarreled. She used extremely  harsh words  and ask some very  deadly  questions. Questions that she know will hurt the listener's heart, literally giving me a heart attack...and  in series ...so is like combos...get it? Almost got KO by her. Told [her] she is  very  mean and selfish. A girl who is so ego- centric , so self- centered ... is not like [her] at all. I told her she is like a split.(2 personality). She denys. I was hurt so much that I sort of hate her ...alot. I do not know how to describe, but I kind of hate her and at the same time not. I hate her for what she said yesterday, thats all. But thats enough too, she had gone too far,  too much , absolutely over-board. Even I myself cannot believe what she said to me. I kept wondering"is that [her]?". Yes  Eddie,  wake up! Its her.Take it easy, believe the truth! Thats her alright! Try accepting it!  Daffy 大姐 , if you are there...heres a qusetion for you. "Did she do that on purpose, to make me stop thinking about her?". Anyway, if thats the case, then... she is making a big mistake. Thats not the way to solve problems....then again...if thats from her  heart ...she is not worthy...sorry to use this word...but if only you people heard the conversation...she is like posessed. Not worthy to be my friend. Maybe she is not even worth my time. Hate her so much now...but thats now...my previous wounds are back again. Devastation to me. I think she has given me enough " hints " about me not belonging to the group. I think my time  is up . I have to leave. I will inform the group tomorrow. I must not leave just like that without telling them, or I will regret forever. I will miss the group... alot ...especially  Candy  and  Joanne , who really² treat me like a  brother .Love them so much, I think I am going to  miss  them alot. This time, I need a longer time to heal the wounds. Like I said yesterday...she literally used a shotgun. Shotgun is spread shot, so there are many bullets in me. That will take a while to get it out, all of them. Think I have to stop now, because  Jin Shun  got to go and he wants to read them now. So i got to publish now. Love you  Daffy 大姐  and  Jin Shun  too.Bye²      -reluctant to leave-

       M o o d : v e r y   c o n f u s e d   a n d   s a d       I really don't know what happened that made [her] ask me that question. Is it something  wrong  I did? Or was it something I  said ? She ask me "if one day","i mean if la", "if one day the group reject u joining the group","how will u feel". I then  told  her that I must had done something  very wrong . She shen continused"if it's not becoz if doing something wrong". I then got really  shocked , and almost dumb folded. She then asked"how do u tell someone that they actually dun belong to a group". I almost got what she mean by then. I am  so sad  now. Nobody understands. Nobody. Not even me. What is the cause of it? Is it the question that I answered? Or is it that my  presence  made her feel  awkward . Can anyone tell me? Daffy 大姐, if you are reading this, I hope you can tell me the answer. Why is she like that to me? I already told her, that she could treat me like a brother. (away).(back).Just told her that she could be my sister. I am willing to forget about the sad past... now . But why can't she? She told me that she is avoiding me. I expected that and  felt that too anyway . Apparently, she literally took a shotgun and  blast  it right through my heart. That hurts. Just heard that Daffy 大姐 betrayed me. So sad. I  did not  expect that to happen. The  group  is still very nice to me. Except Daisy and Shu Qing, who both talk very little to me. Even though sometimes the group is  unusually  quiet, but we are still  close . It cannot be true that the group want me  out of the herd . The root of the problem... the girl . I think I will update again later...after the "talk" is over.      -falling deep-

       M o o d : h a p p y  Hey ppl..u all should take this test too...IQ test frm:   urlLink  http://web.tickle.com/tests/uiq/authorize/signin.jsp?url=/tests/uiq/index2.jsp     this is my result... yeah so happi     Eddie, you answered 24 out of 30 questions correctly! Congratulations! Your score is in the percentile("91"); 91st percentile. This means that if one hundred people took the test with you, your score would rank higher than 90 of them on average.When we analyzed your test, we also discovered that when it comes to quantitative ability, you measure in the percentile("83"); 83rd percentile. This score indicates you have unusually strong abilities when it comes to solving numerical problems. If there is a numerical pattern to be found, you'll find it. You've got a knack for noticing when something "isn't right." Whether you're conscious of it or not, you have an ability to simply understand when something doesn't add up. Also, when it comes to splitting the check, doing taxes, or determining the number of fans in a baseball stadium, you're the one people turn to.    P.S anyway hope tt u all not offended by this...caus this is my blog and why can't i post something which i am proud of? Guai² ar everyone bye²    -vanished-

Still cannot forget abt her though accepting that she is not rdy for a relationship. I told her I would wait...anyway she seems so engrossed with her O'Level...wah...then I ask myself:"izzit the time for awakening?" I got a pathetic C5 for my chinese language and my oral is onli a (P) pass ...but of coures chi is my  worst  sub so other sub should be fine ...I mean  better . Aiyo, lucky for Jin Shun or else I would "想不开" I realli wan to use this chance to thank him for all the concern provided that he reads this. He is one kind soul out there to help people...noe when to joke and when not to.... recently ..ha². Kinda respect him more now for all that he contributed...his unlimited jokes...though some realli "yellow"....I remember I cannot accept those jokes in the past but now.....sian already...lol. Jin Shun is rite abt the other time.....I realli is too anxious....sian man. Just hope that after O'Level I will be given the chance lor....provided that I still luv her.   Oh!

He also quite smart leh...chinese get A1 ....but who noes later like tt Karine ...everything bad except chi ...so sad ...still so notorious and haven wake up yet....sry but i think her chances of going to a poly is slim. Hope God guild her lor.Sian i gtg finish ANBA's homework liao. Anyway just hope that this comming FRI can go out with the group lor......再见!  -gone for now-
