      Okay, it's 5:45 PM. At 7:00, Shrek 2 is playing in a theatre near my house. At 6:30, Ross will be picked up in my car, with me and my dad in it. Then, we're gonna go to the theatre, meet a nice girl named Nikki and her friend Amber, and see a movie. YES!!!!!!   So now I'm here, listening to "Smile Lines" by Incubus. This is a damn good CD. I bought it just before going to spring break this year. We went west again in 04. However, in 2003 we went to Flagstaff. In 2004, we stayed in Las Vegas. Which was fun! It really was. It may seem like there's just porn and strip clubs and adult stuff to see there, but there's more for kids than you think. The only part that really ruined it for me was the porn in the streets. If you walk along the sidewalk, you just seen porn, just LYING in the streets, everywhere. More than half the ground is covered by it. It's all passed out by these Mexicans who can't speak a word of Spanish, so you can't tell them to quit handing porn out to these little kids. If you go to Vegas, just watch the kids' eyes. They'll learn more than they should while they're down there.  That's just kind of how the world goes though. We do shit without thinking about. Then when we do think, we decide that some later generation will take care of it. Like global warming. Inflation. War. We just fuck everything up, then let our kids take care of it. It's all Bush's fault....

      August 9, 2003. I lied. Yes, I did. So I got what I deserved. Katie dumped me. Ross cussed me out. Jeff told me he was ashamed of being my friend. I call Kelly, the only person I can run to now, and I'm going fucking crazy, saying some crazy shit about running away to Flagstaff, like that'll fix everything. I said something really dumb about I'll find some fucking answer there. Don't ask me what I was talkin about. That was my only suicidal experience, that night. I got my head phones, played a loud song, walked around for four hours in my neighborhood, burned a Bible. I just had no faith in anything. That night, Kelly talked about me lying as well. So because of my stupid actions, I was out. No body. I had to start from scratch. Clear and complete scratch.  That summer just about killed me, if I didn't have something to hold on to. No, it wasn't Flagstaff, but it was close. I learned a lot of things. About lying...about trying to impress people falsely....about saying and doing things without thinking about the consequences.   For three months after the summer, until the middle of January, I wondered aimlessly around, trying to put my life back together. Didn't talk to Katie much, she still insists on ruining my life. Me and Kelly went out for a bit. Jeff and Sarah did. Then...I met Nicole, and things changed. I had someone who would help me, and piece me back to the person I was. Nicole was my salvation. Nicole made me who I am. Nicole...was my Flagstaff.

       Proof  by Matt Bennett  How do you prove something to someone? That you won't do Say Think something. How do you prove that your actions Will reflect your feelings? That everything will do Will prove That you're loyal? Why does every conversation have to be a struggle? Every meeting a challange. Every social event a test. When the person you that requires the proof Has proved themselves to you. And you To them. You try to match them. You try to show them that what you say Is what you will do And everything you said About being loyal About always loving that person And not the ones that are less close to you Will stay true. Why is proof required for this? I thought my love was enough To show you That they don't matter.

      April 2003. The Bennett family flies to Denver, then to Las Vegas, to drive to Flagstaff, Arizona. Their middle son, Matt, had Meteora by Linkin Park in his CD player and It by Stephen King in his hand over the next six days. Normal days consisted of Matt waking up early to go get a cappucino at Barnes and Noble, then reading for a while, finishing It and listening to the CD a lot. When the week was over, he stared out the rental car window the entire five-hour drive back to Las Vegas. He watched as the grassy lands of Flagstaff, Arizona turned into the desert landscape of Las Vegas, Nevada. For some reason, Matt (I) became attached to Flagstaff. Thought of it as almost a place of salvation, like the ideal life could and would be lived there. Salvation should not be obsession.   July 2003: Katie had a party. Who came? Her boyfriend (that would be me), Ross, and Sarah. We went bowling. Fun? How about no. We get back after that, me and Ross are talkin the whole time, Katie's tryin her best to be all nice and stuff. We had cake or something, her mom was telling me that Katie acts like that around boys occasionally. Personally, I kinda just wanted to go home. No offense to my girlfriend, Katie, but I just wanted to leave THEN because I knew what was gonna happen when I left. Ross was talkin to me about some really cool movie, and I was real into the conversation. Who comes over and takes my hand? Katie. My dad cames (thank you Lord) and Katie kisses me. Thankfully, she didn't hit my lips, but what the hell? I get in the car, my dad asks if I had fun, I look at him and say "it was cool hangin with Ross....can we go get some fast food?"

      Indeed I do. Well...did, considering that school is out. It's about 11 o'clock right now. I just got inside from cleaning my swing set for an hour, clearing out funky woods debris and stuff, ya know. I woke up about 10 at Doty's house. Came upstairs, ate breakfast, realized that my clothes were in his dryer and my video game controllers were downstairs. Then, we got my stuff, I came home, cleaned, and here I am, waiting for Nikki to get online. Her mom's on right now. She's REALLY cool.   I'm runnin on about 4 and half hours of sleep here. I went to bed about 5:30. The four of us watched Grind, then went to bed.   My plans for the day....hmmmm....NOTHING!

      June Twenty-Something.... Me, Katie, Ross, Sarah, Jeff, and Kelly all go to Sarah's to have a good night of fun. It was cool, spent about 4 hours there. Three couples all hangin out, watchin movies. Katie was holding my hand. Jeff and Kelly were sittin together. Ross and Sarah didn't touch each other. We watched Snatch (a really good movie) on Sarah's laptop. Ross, Jeff, Sarah, and Kelly all went outside, Katie and me stayed inside. Katie curled up under me, I put my arm around her. The other two couples came back. Katie still hated Kelly. Kelly still hated Katie. Sarah still loved Katie. Sarah still loved Kelly. I...didn't know who I loved.

      Okay, I'm downstairs in Doty's basement. We've been hangin out all day. Me, Carlton, Doty, Niko. Some fag won the Indy 500, we didn't even watch it. It rained sooo hard earlier, we all went out without our shirts on and chased frisbees and ran around. It was fun.   We'll be up all night. But who really cares? I don't have anything to do until Tuesday night. I gotta get a physical before I go on this big camping trip this summer. We're goin to Isle Royale on Lake Superior for a week with my Boy Scout troop. We're gonna go 60 miles in 6 days with 40 pounds on our backs. Hmmmm....  Well, tomorrow, I'm gonna write a whole bunch of Flagstaff stuff, which would be nice. Actually....later today...

      I'm at Doty's house right now. Carlton is over too, he's freaking awesome too. We were watchin the Indy 500 till they red flagged us, then they're startin again at 5. Doty's older brother and dad are down there in Indianapolis seein it. That's cool!   We were playing WarioWare Inc. It's this game for Gamecube, plays up to four players, and you play these little games called Microgames. But they're all like....less than 5 seconds long. It'll say like "dodge" and you'll be like a motorcycle on a road and you have to dodge cars for 3 seconds. Yes, literally, 3 seconds. It's like the best party game ever. It's FUN! With a capital F...added onto the F....thats already capitalized....shut up, I'm trying my best. HAHA!  Today's a good day because it just...IS! Ya know? I went up to the lake yesterday, which was fun. My grandparents live there in the summer, go to Hawaii in the fall, and live here in Fort Wayne in the winter and spring. They're my mom's parents. My dad's aren't with us anymore.  So Niko is about to come over. Another NICK in my life. Niko Ehlerding, really cool dude, been my friend a while. I help him out with stuff, he's kinda like a lil brother to me. So Doty is here shooting me with his air soft gun. His rat terrier, Jake, is climbin all over us, and I'm over on the couch on the laptop. Well, goin to get some XBOX controllers before Niko comes.

      Okay, second day doing this, except I was doing a bunch last night after midnight, so TECHNICALLY the second day was late last night. And don't tell me about late. I was up until 4:30 last night with Nikki....and it was awesome. We just talked really late, said some stuff we needed to say. Neither of us could sleep, because we were like...so freaking happy. She's just....wow, dude, you have no idea. I'm sure some day I'll find the words to describe her. For now...nope.  Got a couple friend problems going on right now. Lotta people come to me. I don't mind though. If my really good friends come and talk to me, that's not so bad. I'm one of those advice givers. People come to me to tell me problems, vent, all that stuff. It's usually not an exchange though. People TELL me they'll listen to me and talk to me about my problems...but they usually never do. Only one who really does is Nikki. Hence, why I'm so close to her.  I was thinkin about getting my little brother (Nick, we all call him Nicky, it's confusing now with Nikki and Nicky) and my best friend (Steve Doty, but we all call him Doty) and Nikki to go see Shrek 2, cuz that movie looks awesome. Maybe Sarah. She's one of my really good friends. Matt, Nicky, Nikki, Doty, and Sarah.....we'd get arrested....  You see, Nicky kinda takes after me. He's smart, but he's really fun. He just turned 12 this month, and also graduated from 5th grade this month. He went K-5 at Lincoln Elementary. Me and my older brother, Dan, went there too. Now....Nicky just got out of 5th, I just got out of 8th, and Dan just got out of 11th. So NEXT year, Nicky will go to his new school, Shawnee, where I just left. Dan will stay at Northrop, and he'll go in as a senior. I'll be going in as a freshman.  Doty lives right next to me, we've known each other forever. He's a really crazy funny guy, always doin fun stuff. But you can also like talk to him about stuff. We don't talk all SERIOUS that often, but he's a really smart kid. He's just...cool. Everyone should have a friend like Doty.  So will we go see Shrek 2? Or will we not? No...The question is....will any of these broken lives of ours allow us to have a night of fun and relaxation?

      I'm not really that negative, trust me. Right now, my life is almost perfect. My mom lost her job recently, but was even more recently rehired. YAY! I have Nikki, who cheers me up just by lettin me think about her. YAY! I'm writing a book this summer that I hope to publish in the fall. YAY! School is out. YAY! I'm learning how to be a better person and not to lie and say things I don't mean to say. YAY!   You see. Life is all about being positive. EVERYONE has negative stuff in their life. Whether you're black white green orange rich poor Martian or dead...you have negativity in your life. However, everyone also has positive things in their life. It's all about balancing those. And, if you can, making more positive than negative. When you're negative, you have no reason to live. When you're positive, you have no reason to stop smiling. I'm not saying "EVERYBODYYYYY SMILE!". I'm not fucking Barney, okay? But I'm also not gonna be like "You damn Nazi conformists raping the teenage Justin-Timberlake society, perverting your polo shirts and designer pants while stepping on our pitiful hearts with stoletto heels". I'm right in between.   My job in life is to make people happy. Job for who? I dunno! Quit asking hard questions. Here's the big plan though. I plan on writing for the rest of my life. I know its very hard to make a living out of it. So chances are....I won't. But, no matter what occupation I find myself fufilling in the next ten years or so, I see writing somewhere in it. If not, I'll write on the side. Why do I write?  Because people like learning and reading about other people, while still maintaining a piece of themselves. My writing is about real people. It's hard for me to find myself making a big, invincible hero. No body is invincible. So where is the relation? Where is the personal unsaid connection between Reader, Writer, and Character? I have fun writing. People have fun reading. If we're all having fun, we're all happy. Happiness is your key man. Books are just those fake dog poop things that make sure you dont lose your key.

        Kelly: Where the fuck are you gonna go, Matt? Me: Flagstaff... Kelly: Flagstaff? You're gonna fucking go to FLAGSTAFF? How you gonna get there, huh? Me: Plenty of ways to get there. Kelly: And what happens when you get there? Me: I learn what the hell is going on. Kelly: You'll die, Matt. You're not going. Me: Can you stop me? Ross and Katie won't. They fuckin ditched me. Kelly: Katie isn't gonna ditch you. Me: We broke up. Kelly: When did this happen? Me: Yesterday, Ross told me off, too. Kelly: Can't get much worse.    Running away from your problems will not help them. If you try to run from a bear, it will think of you as prey, and kill you.

      Can I stay up all night? The mentality of it seems so foreign. It's like lying awake at four in the morning And not being able to sleep. Or watching TV at six thirty at night And wanting to go to bed and dream. The Mountain Dew can pile gets bigger. Nikki says "you gotta stay up all night, honey". My little brother sleeps twenty-five feet behind me. My family sleeps twenty-five feet above me. I love her... The music says "If you believe in the world I've come in, you'd be strong". Our Lady Peace? I like this band. Who sings this next song? I own this CD! I didn't download this one. Oh, Incubus, I like this band too. I took their CD with me to Las Vegas this year! I also took Nikki's picture And the note she gave me. "I'll miss you, sweetie, I'll think about you." How you know that's what it says, Matt? I still have the note.  It's one in the morning.

      A song I'm listening to right now:    Your words to me just a whisper Your faces so unclear I try to pay attention Your words just disappear  'Cause its always raining in my head Forget all the thing's I should have said  So I speak to you in riddles because My words get in my way. I smoke the whole thing to my head and feel it wash away 'cause i don't take anymore or this, I want to come apart. or dig myself a little hole inside your precious heart  'Cause its always raining in my head Forget all the things I should have said  I am nothing more than a little boy inside That cries out for attention though I always try to hide 'Cause I talk to you like children, Though I don't know how I feel But I know I'll do the right thing If the right thing is revealed  'Cause its always raining in my head Forget all the things I should have said

      Yeah, that's my girlfriend's name. Nikki. Nicole (middle name) (last name). 13 years old, is gonna turn 14 this summer, she'll be going into 8th grade next year. However....I'll be goin into 9th. You know what this means? Different schools.   Oh darn! The kiddie's won't be able to have sex while they're at different schools! Don't seperate them!   Alright, first off, I'm a virgin, proud to be, moving on...Second of all, I'm tired of hearin about people who got all these PHYSICAL relationships. Me and Nikki kiss, yeah, maybe like making out, yeah, maybe a lil more than kissin, yeah, but we're not gonna do anything DUMB! And what sucks is, people think we just fuck! Yeah, look at us, we're fuckin in middle school, and my 13-year-old girlfriend's pregnant! Ain't THAT sumthin to be proud of!  Me and Nikki are really, REALLY,  REALLY  close. The emotional aspect is a lot bigger and lot more important than the physical stuff. It's fun to be hangin out, kissin, all that stuff. It's cool! But what matters most to me, more than anything in my life, is the fact that I'm so close with that girl. I can tell her anything. She cares. I can talk about my writing. She cares. I can talk about books, movies, dogs, lobsters, Godzilla, religion, what's for dinner, why Brad Pitt's cheek bones are so huge...I can talk about anything! (p.s. Brad Pitt is really cool and he's a damn good actor)  So here's my thoughts on Nikki for the night, just some stuff I wanna throw in. I keep thinking about something that happened yesterday. We were together, down at this park near my house, and we were layin there. I was on my back, she was to my right. Her head was layin on my chest, her right arm draped around me, her right leg bent over my legs, and I laid there with my right arm around her. I said "Are you happy?" and she nodded against my chest and said really softly, in that voice I love hearing so much, "Yes..."

      Yes, indeed, it  is  Saturday night. And what is Matt doing on Saturday? Well....writing this. Unless of course I'm having an out-of-body experience. Which would be weird...Don't you just HATE that? Watching those dumb stupid shows on Lifetime about some crazy hick who almost died and "saw a light at the end of a tunnel". That's religion does to ya, man...  No offense to anyone religious. I have nothing against people who choose to make religion a part of their lives. I do, however, have a lot against many religions. Mostly Christians.    Why Christians? Because I know the most about Christianity. How do you know so much? I used to go to this youth group. Isn't that a good thing? Yes, it is a good thing, until they start practically forcing you to pray and read the Bible. Why in the world would they force you!? Because they're Christians.   You catchin my drift here?

      Now...what should I say to start this all off? I'm pretty sure all of the philosophical oh-my-god-that's-so-deep openings have been used already. So I'll begin with me pondering about something to replace those timeless beginnings, such as....  "In the beginning..."  or  "It was a dark and stormy evening..."  Hmmmm....this isn't really the BEGINNING, because I'm 14, gonna be 15 in September, so the beginning was September 24, 1989. It's not the beginning of my relationship with Nicole. Today marks exactly two months. So the beginning of what? Making my life open to random net surfers?  It's also not stormy, nor is it evening. It is dark, yes, because it is night time here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.   So, back to the original question: What should I say to start this all off? Nothing deep will work. Nothing clever and witty will work. Nothing spontaneous and funny will work. Let's just start out with this: My name is Matt...

      It's like 9:15 or so in the morning, I've actually been up since 8:30, which is the earliest I've woken up in a while, if you exclude vacations and such. I'm leaving for my grandparents' house soon, then its off to lunch and to work at the preschool.  This morning, Dan, my older brother, tried to cook an egg sandwich in our George Forman (Foreman?) grill. He got a piece of Texas Toast bread, punched the middle down, put an egg in, and stuck it in the grill. First try was a failure, second try was actually somewhat accomplishing, and he said it tasted really good. Interesting...  The hardest part about leaving is definitly not being around Nicole. I love her so much, and I'm gonna miss her so much. I'm gonna go freakin crazy up at camp not bein with her, I swear. But in the middle of July, she's moving to a house really close to mine, so I'm gonna see her a LOT and I'm REALLY excited. I'll miss my baby this week, but it's only a week.

      Here it be, the last post before I depart on my journey to Ashley, Indiana. I leave early Sunday morning and I'll be getting back Saturday afternoon. June 27 to July 3. Tomorrow I have work to do at my grandparents' house, at a preschool for an Eagle project, then tomorrow night I'm going to a movie with Nicole, so this shall be the last post before I leave.  The thing last night got sorted out. One girl has to pay for their broken front door, but that's it. I really hate the justice and police system, they know nothing about what happened, and convict people on one side of the story, mostly the person being convicted's story. There's four kinds of people who suck in this world. Politicians, judges, lawyers, and cops.  Well I guess it's time for me to go get some grilled cheese and relax for a while. I shall see you all in a week's time to tell of my brave adventures during the next week....slash telling you how scout camp was.....BYE!

      I just got home from violin practice to see Nicole online. She's frantic, telling me how she's home alone with her older sister and there's a bunch of teenagers outside throwing rocks at their house, threatening them, breaking a door open. Her parents pulled up and she had to go. I don't know what the hell's going on.  She JUST got back on, and I asked if she's okay. Her parents are calling the cops, and supposedly there's a girl outside screaming and calling her a bitch. Now she just said this:   FreakoNikki911 (8:32:51 PM): im fine....im gonna go the cops are on their way so im gonna go now...ill be back after they leave...i love you so much matt bye FreakoNikki911 signed off at 8:32:53 PM.    So yeah. She's gone. I don't know what it is about people. Why are they so fucked up? Nicole didn't do anything to deserve that. Nothing more than what any of you have done. It's not about that phrase "Why do bad things happen to good people?" That's just some conceited bull shit. This is about why people need to do things to other people for no reason. What right do some random fucking people have to do that shit to Nicole!? That's so fucked up!   I only have a hate for people who intentionally physically inflict pain upon someone out of hate. I would never in my life just hurt or kill a person out of rage or hate. Revenge is a different story. But see, revenge in my eyes should never be more than the pain that was inflicted. Those people throwin rocks, that's not revenge, that's mother fucking STUPIDITY. The only reason for me to hurt or kill a person would be in self defense or revenge. Now I wouldn't kill someone out of revenge unless, of course, they killed a part of me.

      Well, four days, but who's counting?...Besides me?....  Anyways, you didn't really miss much. I went to the lake cottage on Sunday for most of the day, actually came back a color other than white. Monday night I got my Totin Chip in scouts (it's taken me longer than anyone else in troop history) so this means I'm allowed to use knives and axes and saws without permission from an adult. Also, I'm gonna become First Class at camp next week, which is good, because I've been holding off on that too. But, it's all good now. Yesterday, I didn't do anything besides get online, practice my violin, and watch Joe Schmoe 2 on Spike TV. Which, by the way, is a HILARIOUS show.   Now, it is Wednesday, and here is my schedule: Do. Absolutely. Nothing. YAY! It's fun being lazy! Tomorrow I have violin lessons, Friday I'm going to some stupid birthday party, on Saturday I got a BUNCH of labor work to do, but Saturday night will totally make up for it. I'm goin to see a movie with Nicole. And it's gonna be the coolest fucking night EVER!  Even with everything bad going on, even with my friend count going down by the day, she's always there for me to make me laugh or listen to me or tell me how she feels or just have FUN with me! I'm so happy with her it's insane. Nobody makes me smile or laugh or cheer up like she does. She can just say "cheer up baby" and I'll get this huge smile on my face. She's so awesome. *SIIIIGH* Well, looks I'm gonna go. I'll start writing regularly now, unless I'm gone of course.

       It's Not That Bad  by Matt Bennett  These summer days...they're not just regular days. I look at her and she's says things are just great. It seems like things are wrong, or am I just weird? I try to make it up and say things she wants to hear.  Because this is not the way it should be Where I'm stuck trying to reach reality. When she's happy, why do I think's she sad? Is everything falling apart or is not that bad?  She tells me everything is gonna be fine. She writes in her journal, I write in mine. Am I just paranoid, or are we going downhill? Am I trying to hard, or is there a heart to fill?  I say I love her...and she says it back. Is the base of this whole thing starting to crack? Why do I freak out when she just says "hi"? Why is it I can't let anything by?  Because this is not the way it should be Where I'm stuck trying to reach reality. When she's happy, why do I think's she sad? Is everything falling apart or is not that bad?  It's not that bad....  Why do I lay at bed at night and think about you? Why am I still happy when I can't sleep and it's 2:00? Why do I not care when you make fun of me? Why do we laugh when my jokes aren't that funny?  There's not some guys wearing trench coats after me. I don't think anyone except her can quite see She's always happy, it's not my fault. That I think she's, why does paranoia run it all?  Because this is the way it should be! I'm no longer stuck chasing reality. She's always happy, I know she's not sad. Everything's going fine...it's not that bad.

      Everything goes so well until I fuck it up. It was the best time ever. We were both being sweet and having so much fun because no body could touch us. We were happy.  Then what do I do? Lose my temper. Yell at her. And now she gets off early and I'm stuck here to bask in what I just fuckin did to her.   Why does she still put up with me, honestly? I don't deserve such an awesome girl like her, and she doesn't deserve  a fuck-up like me. She is so fucking awesome. She is just the nicest fucking person you could ever meet in your entire life. She just has the purest heart in the universe, I swear to god. But I get so fuckin carried away sometimes. She doesn't need somebody like me. I just keep bringing her down. I really don't wanna lose her, but I hate bringing her down like this.   Nobody knows how much I love her. NOBODY! She is everything to me and I wish I could be happy with her forever. But I'm always screwing everything up. Something keeps her with me though. There are so many reasons for her to just dump me and get it over with, but she hasn't. I've done so many things to make her want to get rid of me, and she she never has. There's some reason why she doesn't wanna get rid of me.  I mean, I guess everyone's got that something, right? Maybe that's why everyone has a soul mate. Everyone has that ONE thing that SOMEONE else loves about them. You see....if that thing is keeping Nicole with me, then I guess it's the one thing no one else can see.   That's what Nicole has done. Until I met her, I was always the nerd. I was always the guy getting picked on. For everything I said, did, wrote, thought, it was all labeled as nerdy and being a loser. When I met Nicole, she would say these things...that would just make me freeze. Like she thought I was a great person. And how she thought I was attractive. Even today, she still says these things. And every time I hear them, I thank God that I have her. She's the one who saw through me, and liked what she saw. I'm not the nerdy loser to her. She cares about me like no one else ever has. She has feelings for me that no one else has ever had. I am a good person to her! I'm not the ugly outcast anymore! Even if so many other people still think that, I have that one person that doesn't think that.  And there's those things that other people made fun of me about that would just kill me. Words I said, shows I watched, games I played, things I did. I would just get ripped to shreds by people that I used to look at as friends. Obviously today, I don't.  Nicole would make fun of those things too. But she never did it with an evil smile. It was always that normal, happy smile she always had. She always told me she was joking, and I always believed her. I knew she was kidding, and I started to  like  it when she made fun of me. When she made fun of me, I knew she was kidding, and that was so far off from  what I was used to. And it made me feel good. It was fun to laugh at myself, and know someone else was laughing at me, but it wasn't in a mean.  Tonight, for some reason that I don't know of, I yelled at her for it. It was something small. Something so minute, yet I snapped. There were things in my head tonight. Ross. Amber. Kelli. Sarah. Everything they've done to me. Everything they're doing to me. It was all in my head as I was talking to Nicole. Nicole says one thing and BAM! I blow up.  A few seconds later, I was just hit with this gigantic wave of extreme guilt and remorse and sorrow for what I had done. She said some things that I really should take to mind, then she left.  I never want that feeling again. I never, EVER wanna yell at Nicole again. Until about ten minutes ago, I thought that sometimes you had to yell at people, sometimes it was necessary. After doing this tonight, I realized that you can get around anything without yelling. I never want to yell at her again. Not just about this, but about anything. I'm being eaten from the inside by the old me, and it hurts. It hurts more than anyone could ever know. When flashes of what I used to do come up like this, such as snapping at Nicole, it makes me realize how vulnerable I am to the person that lives inside me, waiting to just lash out at everyone again.   That won't happen though. I have a weapon now. I have a reason for staying how I am now. I have a reason for not yelling anymore. I have a reason for laughing at myself, for loving myself, for accepting myself. I have a reason for going through my life and living it to the fullest, just as I've always wanted to do. I have a reason to never, EVER, under any circumstances, snap at or blow up at the one I love again.  My reason....is Nicole.

       FreakoNikki911: i dreamed of someone who would understand me, who wouldnt consider me just as their girlfriend, but their friend, who they wernt afraid to be themselves around, who would talk about their feelings.......thats you matt...when i met you i knew you were different...we got in that seat together after wendys and we instantly just started talking about parents, school, friends..everything.....you said you liked my smile and my eyes but that wasnt the best part....you said you thought i was awesome....you liked the INSIDE..you saw farther than anyone else and i KNEW right then..that you were different, that you were the one for me   Nicole just said that to me a few minutes ago, we were just talking online. I don't think she has any idea how much she means to me. We're both having rough times right now involving friends and such. But we still got each other. That up there is actually an answer to a question of mine.  Every day, I need her more and more. And everyone, I get closer and closer to her. With every time she smiles, she is ten times as beautiful. With every time she laughs, she is ten times as funny. With every time she kisses me, I love her ten times as much. I need her...and I only want her. I will not lose this. I will not just change my mind some day. I will never want a relationship for as long as I live.  My question for Nicole was:  "Why did you choose me? You could have gotten ANY guy...but you chose me. Why? I'm not saying I don't deserve this, or am trying to be hard on myself. I just want to know if I'm the man you've always wanted. Am I just the best you could find, or what you've always dreamed of?"

      I saw a movie with Nicole tonight.  It was perfect.  A lot of people say nothing can be perfect. They say you just can't be absolutely perfect.  Tonight was perfect.  It was our entire relationship packed into 4 hours. We were together, just cuddling and being close. We had the physical things, kissing and such. Some sexual things. We had the serious talking, the "I love you"s....the ones that were real and meaningful. We had fun, making jokes and laughing, smiling. We walked around together, and didn't do anything physical while we walked, but still had a lot of fun. Everything in our relationship was there. It was all just summed up.  I really started to understand tonight. I really started to learn how deep love is, and how it engulfs you complete. But you want it to. You want the love to take you over. Because when you're in love, everything is bright.  I knew this when she put her hand on my face. We were just messing around, scooting away from each other and giving sad puppy faces, and she leans over and kisses me, and we didn't just sit there, we didn't just kiss, we got close. She pulled me closer with one arm. She put her other hand on my face. Not just lightly, she held it there. I don't know what it was about that, but the meaning of all this really just HIT me.   I knew what love was about, and how it felt. But when she did that, it was just like BAM! I knew I wanted it to be this deep. It wasn't about HAVING it, it was about wanting what I already had. I was so happy, thankful, grateful for this love when she did that....and the world is bright now.  She's everything I've always wanted. She's the funniest person in the world, no one makes me smile like her. She listens to me. She cares about me. Now that's a big one. Most people don't give a rat's ass about anything I say, especially my writing. Nicole LOVES it when I talk about my writing, and that's the one subject everyone else hates. I'm not afraid to be around this girl.   You see....I'm what some people would call a "nerd". I don't act all nerdy, but because I am "smart" and have decent grades in school, I'm a "nerd". So to kinda get rid of that label, I don't use big words, and I don't act smart, even thought sometimes I really want to, because it's natural for me sometimes. I like to share things with people, and most of my "friends" just make fun of me. With Nicole...I'm not afraid. I don't hold back on her. Yeah, if I use a big word, she'll joke or something about it. But I know she isn't serious. She appreciates me. And I appreciate her, EVERYTHING about her.   I need her. And I want to be with her forever. Because she just understands me. She knows who I am, and she can see what I'm gonna do before I even do it. I care about her. I think she's the coolest, funniest, most beautiful girl in the world, and she is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me, by a long shot. There are some things in your life that you say and you mean it. Yeah, you mean a lot. But some things, they are just so fucking important, that they just have to be said. These things are the words you say at your most sincere, your most honest, your most serious mood. What are my words?  I will love Nicole forever.

       Unless  by Matt Bennett  I'm sorry I can't always stay up late with you. I'm sorry I don't know the answer. I'm sorry that you hate me. I'm sorry that your love for me feels like cancer.  I'm sorry I've been there to listen. I'm sorry that I care about you. I'm sorry that this night had to end. I'm sorry that one isn't better than two.  I'm sorry I never do what I say I will. I'm sorry for always giving my all. I'm sorry for wanting to be friends. I'm sorry for never standing on the wall.  I'm sorry that I can't always make you smile. I'm sorry I can't always make you laugh. I'm sorry I can't always do favors for you. I'm sorry that you feel like that.  Maybe remorse just isn't for me. Maybe I fuck up sometimes. Maybe I can't be everyone at once. Maybe I'm tired of all your lies.  Maybe I have feelings. Maybe I care about all of you. Maybe I don't appreciate this yelling. Maybe I just don't wanna put up with you.  Maybe I'll try harder next time. Maybe tonight I'll stay up late. Maybe I'll get the answer this time. Maybe tomorrow won't be full of hate.  Maybe I'll keep my promise. Maybe I'll back up this time. Maybe I don't wanna talk tonight. Maybe this opportunity isn't mine.  What if tonight I stayed up, and you slept? What if tonight I laughed, and you cried? What if tonight I did it right, and you were wrong? What if tonight I kept a promise, and you lied?  What if I care about you, and you hate me? What if I need you, and you ditch me? What if I loved you, and let me? What if I drop you, and you lift me?  What if the world ended tonight? What if we'll forever be alone? What if I wasn't with you tomorrow? What if I didn't follow you home?  What if I didn't hold your hand? What if I didn't catch your tears? What if you stood there by yourself? What if it was a waste, all these years?  I will never amount to what you expect. I will always walk along like a drone. I don't want to be alone tonight. I hope I'm not destined to forever be alone.  I want to spread my wings with you. I want to show you how strong this love is. I want to prove the things I never proved. I can't let this go, I just won't let it.  I love you more than anything in my life. I have so much I need to show. I wish the world wasn't so god damn hard. I wish my life wasn't so god damn slow.  I will show you who I really am. I will keep those promises you long for. I will prove to you I'm the man you need. Unless you're with me, I won't knock on heaven's door.

      All of these are serious.  "I don't want Matt on my team, Matt sucks."  "You're not gonna be able to stay up all night, you'll never be able to."  "Matt! Can't you just do it right for once?"  "Hey, I know you're having a great time talking about your writing and all, but I really don't care."  "God...not another speech."  "What, did you hear that one in a fortune cookie?"  "Aw come on! Don't let Matt play!"  "Okay, seriously Matt. Cut your hair, you look like a fucking queer."  "I just don't trust you."  "You're 14, she's 13, why do you need to go to the movies?"  "You'll never change, Matt. You'll always be the same asshole."  "I thought I could trust you and you pull this shit."  "You know....my life would be a lot better if I stopped talking to you."  "Don't ask me! He won't know the answer, he only cares about books and shit."  "Hey Matt! Wow! We haven't talked in like three months. Can you do me a favor?"

      Dear Mom and Dad,  It's really important to me that you guys are 33 years older than me. Why is it important? Because you two don't understand a single thing about me. Neither of you know anything about being 14 or being in love. Neither of you understand anything about me, so stop saying you do. You can't read my emotions, you can not look through me like you say you can. You two just don't know anything. Thanks for the allowance, but that's really all that matters to me concerning you two anymore. I'm so sick and tired of you two. You don't trust me at all. You say you do, but through your actions, I found that you don't. So here's a little letter to you two telling you that I'm done putting up with your shit. I hate you both. Thanks for ruining my life.  -Matt-

       All of the following entries were written in a purple notebook over the past three days on my trip to Williamstown, Massachusetts for my dad's 25th college reunion at Williams:      6/11/04  6:05 am  Fort Wayne, Indiana   SUPPOSEDLY, I was to wake up at 4:00 this morning. I was to take a shower, get ready, get on the road by 4:45, drive the half an hour to the airport, then board the 6:00 am flight to Chicago, O'Hare.  Well....all of that was true except the 6:00 part and the 4:00 part. You see....I didn't go to bed, so I couldn't wake up. I got at 1:30 PM Thursday, it's now early morning Friday, and I have not slept. Also, it's a 6:00 flight and we are taking off RIGHT NOW. Yes, as I write this, we are taxiing and preparing to take off.  I just learned how to use my oxygen mask and seat belt. I'm very glad I was taught to put on my seat belt AFTER--We are now taking off--the seat belt sign was turned on. We are now in the air.  I'm in a window seat, and this is really nice. But I miss Nicole. Yeah, I haven't talked to her in about 2.5 hours.  When you're this high above everyone, what do you think? What do you feel? Are these the feelings of all those who sat in this seat before me?  Last night, I finally realized what I want to do with my life. Instead of spilling my emotions to people, like I thought would help, I've realized I just need people. I don't need to tell them my feelingsat all times just to be happy. I have Nikki, and my journal to tell my feelings to. Everyone else just has to be....well....THERE.  Nikki....oh my girl, Nikki. She'll always be there for me, and I'll love her forever for it. Last night she was like, "You've been so good to me lately and tonight I'm going to make this night special."  And she did. It was perfect! She said like everything I needed to hear....without me ever even telling her. She just READ me and said the most amazing things. She'll be on my mind the entire weekend. I can be sure of that. Our estimated time for arrival back to Fort Wayne on Sunday is 2:30. So that means I should be at home, all set, online waiting for or talking to Nicole at 3:30.  This weekend is really about me thinking, clearing my head, deciding where I want to be in life right now, and figuring out where I am. I'll be seeing the Williamstown Museum of Modern Art ( turns out, that while I was writing this journal, I didn't know that there WAS now WMoMA ) sometime this weekend, so that'll be really cool. It'll let me see how other people let out their feelings, while I try to find mine.  I just want to be happier. I am happy, but I'm tired of letting things get to me, and letting people get to me. I'm gonna make my life better, and work to get my happiness.   Time of arrival in Chicago: 6:48 am.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   2:55 pm - Fort Wayne Time  3:55 pm - Williamstown Time  Williamstown, Massachusetts   Sitting in the dorm. My dad is out doing reunion things. I just called Nikki long distance, but my phone has free weekends. Her phone went dead so I'm gonna call her tonight.  Wanna know somethin weird? I feel like starting over. I just called someone,  from Massachusetts , to apologize for stuff I did to them. And ya know what? It felt really really good.  There's gonna be a bigger difference between friends and girlfriend now. I need Nikki for everything, and I'll have her forever. Friends....I just need around. They may not think it's much, but it really truly is. I don't need to spill my guts to my friends or deal with problems with them. I just want them to be my friends. I'll listen to them and help them, but all I need from them is just to be them. As long as they act themselves around me, it's a trillion times more helpful than any serious talk.  I am going to be happier, because I am going to earn it.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   6/12/04  8:55 pm - Fort Wayne Time  9:55 pm - Williamstown Time  Still Williamstown, Massachusetts   Alright, let's do this. Right here, right now, just you and me. Gloves off, no lies, let's do this.  Who am I? Why am I here? Why do I hurt people? Can I stop? How will I stop? What do my friends mean to me? What do I want to do with my life, starting from this point?  I'm sitting in this dorm room by myself, everyone else is seeing fireworks outside. I'm gonna answer all these questions, and figure out what I gotta do.   Who am I?  I am Matt. I care about people, even though it may not seem like it sometimes. I love Nikki more than anything. I don't know if we're gonna be together forever, but I hope we are. Even if I may not be meant to be with her forever, thought I hope I am, I truly, honestly believe it was my destiny to meet that girl. I feel that I am nice, funny, and positive. If I'm not any of those, I definitly have the motivation, determination, and potential to be those.  Nicole said it best in her diary, though I can not directly quote her right now for I do not have access to her diary, but she said, "I am happy with my life. Yeah, some stuff sucks, but life wouldn't be fun without that kind of stuff to deal with. Just let the good outdo the bad." Thanks, baby.   Why am I here?  I believe I'm here to make people happy. Not just happy, but make them appreciate the good things in your life. Laughter does not repair, but it does heal.   Why do I hurt people?  I hurt people because I blame them. I make them and myself believe that they are the sole reason for me being upset. 75% of the time, I don't have the full story. 10% of the time, I overreact. 10% of the time, I have no reasoning behind my yelling. The final 5%, I yell at people to make myself feel better. Does it make me feel better to yell? Sometimes....yes....that's a really fucked up way to think, huh?   Can I stop?  If I really want it, and try my hardest, I will do it.   How will I stop?  I will stop yelling at people. I will show my friends that they are important to me, as well as further show Nikki how much I love her. I will take my anger out in other ways than yelling.   What do my friends mean to me?  My friends are positive energy. Nikki keeps me going, but my friends are a little bit more speed, caffeine, motivation. My friends mean a lot to me, and I'm gonna show it to them.    What do I want to do with my life, starting at this point?  I want to finish my book,  6:10 , this summer. I want to give Nicole the best early birthday ever, since I'll be at Isle Royale that day. I want to get closer with my parents, and be able to talk to them more. I want to show all of my friends who I really am and how important they really are to me.  Before I crash for the night, I wanna thank Nicole for being my guide, my friend....my lover, my everything. You got me to this point, baby. We can both carry the torch now.  To everoyne else, whether I know you or not, grab life by the horns and ride it all the way. Never be afraid of who you are. Be yourself, be smart, have fun, never look back.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   6/13/04  8:45 am - Williamstown Time  7:45 am - Fort Wayne Time  Albany, New York   You kinda....catch onto things when you travel. When you're in an airport, so close to being home that you don't even think about the ride, you noticed small things you don't usually notice. Me, I noticed my stalker didn't change his shorts.  Stalker? Yes, his name is Bill, and wherever we were this weekend, he was there. EVERYWHERE! He doesn't clap, he doesn't pray, he graduated from Williams in 1984, so I'm guessing he's 42, and he wears a lot of Columbia brand clothes, so I'm guessing he's a camper, or a hiker.   I learned a lot about my dad. Learned where he's been in his life, how he came back to my mom, things like that. Going around Williams and learning about his college and the things he experienced there, it really taught me how he ticks. Really learned who he was....who created half of me.  I read "Please Stop Laughing At Me...." by Jodee Blanco this weekend. Read the whole book cover-to-cover in two days. It's the memoir of a woman who was badly abused and rejected throughout her school years, desperately trying to fit in as the abuse even caused her to nearly commit suicide. Along with showing how parents, doctors, and teachers understand nothing about the situation, it brought a ray of hope and inspiration to show that you  can  overcome pain, as well as use the sorrow for better things, such as writing, dancing, or singing. The book really changed me. It really showed me a great perspective on this issue, and really made me ponder whether I am the predator or the prey.  We are now taxiing along the runway. Taking off and.................................lift off! Woohoo!  I just wanna sleep the flight away, and be back with my baby in a few hours.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   11:16 am - Fort Wayne Time  Chicago, Illinois   In layover right now, we don't depart until 1:15. For those of you who are just a BIT slower than the rest of us, that's 2 hours away.  I got all these ideas in my head for these next three books I'm writing, well actually my first three: 6:10, the untitled one, and Burn the Roses. All 3 books, and hopefully many more books after that, take place in my fictional town of Miserette, Indiana.  6:10  is the story of greed and betrayal; the untitled book, which may go under the title of like Black Truck,  possibly  Black House by the Sea, but that's way too long for me, is about revenge, crime, and the benefits and downsides of crime; the third book,  Burn the Roses , is the story of seven teenagers, and the struggle to fit in and survive high school, while trying to deal with the haunting fact that they are all murderers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  12:16 pm - Fort Wayne Time  Still Chicago, Illinois   Wrote in here, walked around, grabbed a latté, and I get back exactly an hour later. Now what do they call that? Is it irony or coincidence? I don't know. It's too early to discuss such advanced topics.  1.) School it out, and I should not have to think  about anything difficult.  2.) On a normal summer day, I'd be in bed for another 2 hours. Therefore, anything before my normal wake-up time of about 2:00 is EARLY.  Theoretically, we should be getting on the plane in a little less than an hour. But airports are big, scary, and unpredictable, just like Oprah. You just never know what you're gonna get, just like Forrest Gump. And anything can happen, just like Neverland.  Speaking of Neverland, why is everyone so mad at Michael Jackson!? The only reason they continue the trial is because the government has a secret money deal with every media company in the world. As long as MJ is still on trial, everyone will keep making jokes. Jackson jokes sell. Though the jokes do go too far sometimes, most of them ARE funny. He's innocent though! He's just a very misunderstood man, and we're to do this to him because he's different? So what if he got plastic surgery and treats his kids weird, that doesn't make him a criminal. He's just different. In a socierty of troubled teens, designer clothes, drugs, and crime, it's a blessing to be different. So why is it that those who are different are labeled as bad people?  Another similar case is R. Kelly. Though I am a fan of his music, I do know he is a wealthy singer. So why would he do something to lose the career of a lifetime? Again, people just take pride in making fun of people and reading about the personal lives of people who are NOT THEM!  I think that's why "reality" TV came around big. People loved watching other people cry, fight, yell, run, kick, bleed. It makes them feel good to see negative things happen to people on TV. Because they know that they're sitting in the quiet of their own comfortable home.  Now that some of that is off my chest, I'm going to finish my latté and wait to board the plane.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  1:28 pm - Fort Wayne Time  STILL Chicago, Illinois   Finally taxiing, we've been waiting for 13 years--er...minutes. By now, we've been sitting on the runway longer than we'll be flying, which the pilot says will be less than half an hour. Oh well, he's probably drunk.  Getting ready to take off. I keep thinking about Nikki. About how I'm gonna go surprise her. I'll be home, she'll have just woken up, I'll tell her how much I missed her, and she'll swear she missed me more, and that's that.  Taking off....and we're off.  The most important thing I learned on this trip was just to stop worrying. The world is okay, everyone I know is okay, and I'm okay. Just let the good take over! Everyone has bad things in their lives, but everyone has even more important things to be happy about.  All this time I thought I wasn't happy, I really was. I just made the bad outdo the good, and that bummed me out. But I get it now! It's taken me this long, but I finally understand. The world isn't out to get me, I just thought it was.  Life is so great, and even though some things are bad, everything else is good. If you don't take anything for granted, you really appreciate the things, people, and privelages in your life. Just think right now. How many people in the world have a personal computer AND internet access? You're reading this because you do, but a lot of people don't. That means you are privelaged, and should not take that for granted. The world's an ugly place, but  everyone  has  someone  who thinks they're the most beautiful thing in the world.

       I Understood  by Matt Bennett  Your smooth face was so beautiful In the dim theatre lights. And as I held you we forgot all about The heartbreak, the fights.  When I told you I'd love you forever I meant it more than anything. And when you said it back to me I could hardly even think.  Some people just don't get it How two people can be in love. And everything is perfect for them Because they see the world from above.  Though they're still down there bathing In the problems that we all have. They have each to hold onto And for that, anyone should be glad.  We stood there under the street light And you held both of my hands. Then you kissed my lips, yeah you kissed my lips, And I started to understand.  It came to me then that love Isn't just about the lack of bad things. It's all about the great amount Of good things that we see.  The days were experience in love Are unlike any before. Because with love comes happiness, Power, and so much more.  It's not about not being lonely And not being by yourself. It's about being loved and being happy Because a world without love....is Hell.

      You herd right godammit! Just kidding. But seriously, Nicole is coming over, and she'll be here in about two and a half hours. You know her, she's gotta start gettin ready at 2 to get here at 4, because that's how girls are. They gotta take 2 or 3 hours to get ready, whereas boys.....maybe 30 minutes TOPS. She takes a shower, dries her hair, puts on make-up, picks an outfit, whatever the hell girls do for 2 hours. Me getting ready...  Taking a shower - 15 minutes Doing your hair (shaking your head) -  15 seconds.   Putting on deoderant, brushing your teeth, shaving, putting Clearsil on -  5 minutes.  Getting everything done in 25 minutes while you're girlfriend does it in 120 -  Priceless.   So here I'm about to go watch the end of American Graffiti, which I started like forever days ago. When Nikki gets here, we watch a movie, mess around for an hour, then go see The Day After Tomorrow with my little brother. Clock says 1:38, she'll be here at 4, that means she'll be here in....GOTCHA! Thought I was gonna do some math didn't ya? Haha! NOPE! It's summer, baby, I can't think that hard!

      We gotta go find Lindenwood Park, because Dan was doing his Eagle Scout service project there. So we leave at 1:15 or so. My mom's directions say "Go down Cook until you get to Hugenhard. Hugenhard turns into Hillegas. After crossing State Street, turn onto Spring Street, then into Lindenwood Drive off of Spring Street." So we go. After State Street was Bass Road....not Spring Street. So we just kept going. Past Illinois Road. Hey, it's comin up, right? Then Independance Street. Okay...now what? Then Hillegas turns into Sumthinwhatever Avenue. No more Hillegas. Hillegas is done. So we turn around in this neighborhood called Wildwood (complete with matching sign reading "security patrolled") and turned back. We drove 15 minutes back the way we came, and turned onto Bass Road. Turns out...Bass Road  is  Spring Street. Those stupid road-naming fuckers.  I went to Borders today with my mom, listened to Blink 182 the whole way there, and I bought Desperation and Mystic River for her to borrow. I'm gonna let Kelli keep  It  and my other copy of  Mystic River . Maybe she'll read them some day....  On the way to Borders, we saw the aftermath of a car crash. One car had two airbags deployed. The front looked like a fucking crushed pop can. The door had been cut off with an electric saw. A cop had come. A truck was 50 feet in front of it. The back was smashed like the front of the other car. In between were pieces of car...and spilt gas. My mom said that car crashes like that make me sick. What makes me sick is the fact that it had to be someone's fault. Someone was too rushed or whatever to care about the road. Now someone's life is ruined.

       Atop This Mountain  by Matt Bennett  Look out there, baby... We own this world. As long as we stand here together We'll never need anything more.  Can you feel that rush of adrenaline When we look into each other's eyes? Can you feel my hand against your cheek As you begin to cry?  My hand can rest here forever Against this soft, smooth skin. Invisible to the negativity And the pain and sorrow within.  I hold you now like I held you then. And how I always will. Your head on my chest, I'm pulling you close, I'd die for you, but never kill.  So come away with me, to a place out there, Where no one else will go. I'll kiss your lips, I'll take your hand, And no one will ever know.  They'll never know the way we look At each other on those bright summer days. And they'll never know the way I  Looked at you among the theatre haze.  They'll never know what it was like to stand out there Holding each other, the rain coming down. They'll never understand the way you smiled And if I looked in your eyes I'd drown.  They'll never know why we kissed there under the tree The rain snapping, the world...gone. They'll never know the way I held you close And begged to stay with you till dawn.  Don't ride away from me yet, It's just not quite our time. I want to be with you forever Above everyone, feeling divine.  I want to stand right here, as we are now And show everyone it's true. I want to show them that we're more than that That I will forever love you.

      Okay. People are yelling at me for my big post about letting shit go. Here's a lil tidbit for all of you:  I am who I am and I'm not a ball of clay. You all can quit criticizing me for how I feel. You all do the same exact things, but I get all the negativity on my shoulders. Let me be happy you fuckers!

      Happy Day, Happy Day, Happy Day. Why's it a happy day? I dunno. Just is.   Me and Nikki, since we read so much, have decided to get three of our own books to get the other person to read. Like  we're gonna pick 3 books that really changed us or made us think, and have the other person read them. I'm having her read "The Regulators" and "Desperation" by Stephen King, and "Mystic River" by Dennis Lehane. She's having me read "Please Stop Laughing at Me", "A Child Called It" and something else, she hasn't decided on the third book yet.  Right now, I have a bottle of water and Baby Cheddar Goldfish. These. Are. The.    BEST!!!!!!!!! FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    For my birthday, I want fifty bags of these. I could eat these for the rest of my freaking life, I swear. These are my favorite food in the whole world. If I have it my way, I would live off of Mountain Dew and BCG's forever.  And it's a good day because my life is better now. I let go of all that negativity last night, and now my life doesn't revolve around the bad stuff, it's all about the good. I'm in my awesome, care-free, in-love mood again. 'Cause you know why? I'm in love with Nicole! I LOVE YOU NIKKI!!!!!!!!!

      I've been thinking about what I just said in my previous post, and I really don't know whats going on. At 1:30, Nikki said she'd be back in half an hour. It's 3:45 and she's not back. She probably went to the store or something. And right before she got off, we talked about Kelli. So I'm  guessing  she's gonna be really pissed off when she gets back.   I mean I'm trying my best here. But there's no way I would ever do anything with any other girls. Even hugging them, it feels like its so fucked up! I'm not just sayin this for Nikki, but whenever other girls like hug me and stuff, because some of my friends are kinda like that, I feel like shit, because it just feels so wrong to me. Whenever I do it, it's so foreign and so wrong. They'll be like "Matt, I need a hug." And I feel bad saying no, but I feel a million times worse actually doing it. It's like "Yeah, I'll hug you girls when you need it. Oh, yeah, and I got some other girlfriend or something." I just can't do it.  It's the same with saying "I love you". I can't say it to anyone except Nikki, because it's like I'm lying. I  don't  love those other people like I love Nikki, so why would I say it? I have these friends that are all like "it's just a hug" or "it's just three words". No....it's not  just  a hug, and it's not  just  three words. When I tell someone other than Nikki that I love them, I am lying to a lot of people. I'm lying to them, because I tell Nikki I love her, and I do not love them like I love Nikki. There is only one kind of love. There is no FRIENDLY love. I am lying to Nikki because I have promised her she is the only girl I will ever love. I am lying to myself because I know that I only care about Nikki like that...I'm not in love with anyone else. And when I hug girls, it's not just a hug. When I hug Nikki, I'm holding her, protecting her, showing her that I will not leave her, and I will not lie to her, and when I hug Nikki I'm showing her that I love her and that I will always be there for her to protect her. When I hug someone else...what am I showing? Am I doing it to make them happy? Am I doing it because I think Nikki won't know? Or am I doing because I am showing them what I show to Nikki? I have my answer....when I hug someone other than Nikki, I am just doing it for them. All I get out of a foreign hug is just pain. I don't know if I'll ever be able to find myself doing it again.  Now...why is it that I only have problems with my friends that are girls? Ross Jeff Andrew Doty Niko, no problems with them! It's always the girls. Sad part is I've gone out with half the girls that I fight with. Maybe Nicole thinks I want them back.  But I don't. I only want Nicole. I never wanna do anything else with anyone except her. I never wanna tell anyone I love them except her. I will always and forever love Nicole, and that is the only girl I ever want to say that to. I will always and forever hold Nicole, because I mean, and it's true, and I never want to hold another girl in my arms.

      I know in a previous post I protected parents, almost even taking their side, well here's my little change of mind. Parents don't know anything. They think they know you soooo well, maybe even to the point where they can read emotions off your face. They can't. Parents know nothing about us. And when I go upstairs after arguing with Nicole about Kelli, like I just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you shut the fuck up!? I don't have to tell you what's wrong  all  the time.  Here's the situation with Nicole and Kelli. Kelli and Nicole don't like each other. At all. Well Kelli is with Jeff, who's a good friend of mine, and Kelli asked Nicole if she wanted to do something sometime. Like all four of us, not just the two girls. And Nicole was like yeah, sure, and was willing to like....drop their arguement and maybe even talk. Kelli didn't! She just said how much she still hat- OOPS! "dislikes" Nicole. So this morning, Kelli is yelling at me for the usual stuff: me never talking to her, me not knowing her anymore, blah blah blah blah blah. Kelli just ASSUMES something. She gets an idea and she just fuckin runs. Whether the idea is right or wrong, she is sticking to it. I don't know if I'll be talking to her much for a while. She's just so STRESSFUL and such a huge burden to me, yet she still calls me her "best friend", which puts her under that category of "Don't me on a LEVEL of friends".  Me and Nicole have been fighting about her way too much lately. Back in January/February, the first time me and Nicole went out, we broke up because of an arguement aobut Kelli. It was a bad break-up. A really really bad one.  But it's not gonna happen again. I've made a promise to Nicole, and a promise to myself, not to let anything--or anyone--break us up like that again. Nicole and Kelli settled it. They both decided they don't wanna be friends, and they don't wanna talk. There is no more reason for me and Nikki to fight about it anymore.  You see...some of my good friends, quote me here: SOME, not all, are girls. This doesn't go over too well with Nikki. I mean, it's reasonable, right? Like some of my friends that are girls are friends with her. And we got this agreement that I can't hang out alone with certain girls and stuff like that. But whenever other girls come up in the conversation with Nikki, she gets so...different. She just completely changes, and I feel like I don't know her anymore. Like she'll be in the best mood, and if I tell her someone wants to hang out with me, she'll be like "oh, ill let you go so you can be with your PRECIOUS kelli" or something like that, even before I can tell Nikki I don't wanna hang out with whoever asked me.  Don't get me wrong. This doesn't mean me and Nikki are gonna break up or anything. There's no way in Hell I'd ever get rid of her, unless she cheated on me....I love her so much. I love her more than anything in the world. If I lost her, it would honestly kill me. I know she trusts me, she tells me she does, and she wouldn't lie to me. I just wish I could prove to her that I'll be faithful...and loyal...forever....

It's a movie about a big storm And knowing Nicole, she'll find it kinky.  I have a blue shirt on. And my gee-tar's on the floor. This song's gettin kinda stupid. So I won't write no more.

      Alright, now it's my fucking turn. Now, it's time for ME to lay stuff down. HOLY SHIT, MATT HAS FEELINGS TOO!? WHY DIDN'T HE TELL US!? Well yeah, it's time. I listened to shit from everybody I know. The only person I  truly , honestly  put my very all into helping is Nikki, because she's the only one who has accepted me. Now, I know this may be a shocker to a lot of you, but I TOO have things that I need to let out sometimes. Yeah, I'm not your pile of shit anymore. I have things just built and built and built on me, and I never get to let any of my feelings out. Well it's about fucking time for me.  First off. I changed. BIG FUCKING DEAL!!! To all of the people who yelled at me for changing, SUCK MY COCK! Because I'm not fucking changing because of Nicole, like all of you assholes said I did. Nicole made me want to change. She made me want to get away from living my life completely circled around personal shit and always hating the world. I decided to be POSITIVE! But all I get from you fuckers is SHIT! Just more shit to add to my pile. I am my own person, so quit trying to fucking change me!   Second...I can do whatever the fuck I want! I can say, do, think, show whatever the fuck I want! If I wanna give a 10-minute speech on how much I love Nicole in my profile, I don't care if it annoys you, DON'T FUCKING READ IT! If I wanna give a 10-minute speech about my fucking prick, don't yell at me, YOU'RE THE FUCKHEAD WHO READ IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! I'm not your fucking slave. I'm not a fucking ball of clay. You are NOT a mother fucking sculptor. Do NOT shape me how you want me, because what you'll get in return, is some shit from me.  Third...Don't MAKE me do favors for you, if you won't fucking return them. All I ever do is listen to people. That's all I ever do. People come to me, and they lay every fucking problem in their life on me, big or small. I try my best to give advice. And it was good. Then I started getting the same problems. So my advice got weaker. They didn't KNOW they were the same fucking problems, but no body ever thought about their problems. They just dumped their shit on me and made me turn it to gold and give it back. Eventually, all I could do was listen. Even then, everyone took advantage of me. They just laid EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM IN THE BOOK on me. And tonight, at least three times, I tried to talk to someone and let stuff out. But no! Some TV show was on, or some fucking mom was calling, or they "just didn't feel like it". Do you think  I  always wanted to listen to you!? Honestly, most of the time, I did. It made me feel good to listen and help people. But then they just laid everything, even little fucking problems they could work out by themselves in SECONDS! Those tiny tiny problems, they dropped on me. Word of mouth says, "Hey, go to Matt Bennett, he's a great advice giver!" Random people saying "hey, my dad blah blah blah school blah blah blah my boyfriend blah blah blah".  Fourth...Quit being so fucking fake! Half of you fucking sluts and your stupid jackass boyfriends don't even fucking know what love is. But you gotta throw the word around like it's a god damn baseball. YOU DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER, QUIT FUCKING SAYING IT! You go out for a week, fuck the whole time, break up, then pretend to be sad and love each other, when actually you just miss your bucktoothed boyfriend or your fake-boobed girlfriend.  Fifth...NICOLE IS NOT RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE! Okay, here's the truth about Nicole for all you FUCKERS who seem to not get it. I love her. Yeah, I love her. WHOA! HE SAID LOVE! No  SHIT  I said love, because I mean it. I care about her. She cares about me. I trust her. She trusts me. I have fun with her. She has fun with me. She loves me. No other person on the planet Earth can truly say they love me like she can. It's either that fake "I love you matt" from random people, or sometimes its the one you get from 'friends' and they're like "i love you matt, for real". Really? You really love me!? Yaaa- FUCK YOU! Nicole has made my life a million times better than it ever was with half of you fucking assholes. Why is she excluded from this pile of shit thing? Because I like helping her with her problems. Because she helps me. She doesn't turn me away. Or say her "computer is broken". Or tell me she doesn't want to. Yes, I've heard all three of these excuses MANY times, more than you could ever think anyone could hear them. Nicole is excluded from all of these things getting laid down....because she is the one person I can name and truthfully said that I love, and that I care about, and that I would do anything for.  Sixth...Quit always looking for someone to blame stuff on. Every once in a while, you guys just have to accept that YOU fucked up, and YOU have to take responsibility. Hmmm...responsibility. The one sign of maturity. A lot of you need to learn about responsibility.  Seventh...Quit fucking each other. For real, it gets old, hearing about the same 4 girls screwing every guy in school. It truly honestly gets annoying. You're gonna get pregnant, and half of you already are. Hmmm....thought I wasn't gonna say names, did ya? Well #7 goes out to Katie Clark, Jackie Sproat, Ashley Johnson, and Leticia. Merry Christmas you fucking whores!  Eight...My profile is my profile. To KC, quit fucking stealing it. To RB, I can put whatever the fuck I want into it. To RB, NE, and AP, I can put whatever the fuck I want in my away message, too.   Nine...Yes, I'm a writer. Quit fucking asking. No, I won't show you my stuff, because I only trust two people to read my new stuff, that would be my dad and Nikki. Quit fucking asking.  Ten...Please stop saying I'm your best friend. You say that to five other people, don't put me on a LEVEL of friendship. I'm either your boyfriend, or you're friend. I hate competing for someone's Ultra Friend and Super Friend and Best Friend and Almost Best Friend and Second Best Friend and Mega Friend. OKAY!? You have a fucking boyfriend or girlfriend, then you have friends. These two groups are SEPERATED! Do not fall in love with me while you're on the fucking phone with you're fucking boyfriend. Boyfriends and girlfriends come FIRST! Friends come second. Not eighth, but definitly not first. They come second.  Eleven...Yes, I used to lie, I don't anymore.  Twelve...Quit bringing up the fucking past. All it will do is make you cry. Then what? Oh, yeah, just go to Matt and dump all of your shit on him.  Thirteen...I beat Aaron Taylor in a rap contest once. So all of you niggers that keep asking me to rap for you, SHUT THE FUCK UP!  Fourteen...I don't give a fucking rat's ass how much people liked her...FUCK MRS.CARBONI! And also...FUCK MR.WINGER! And yeah, this too...FUCK MRS.STEDGE! All three of you fucking pricks are out of my life forever. Have a good life. Don't die too soon.  Fifteen...I hate Elizah from my scout troop. If murder were legal, he'd be at the top of my list. Right under Katie Clark. And Eminem.  Sixteen...Band fag? Haha! I'm a BAND FAG!? YEAH! Well you're either a fucking jock or you couldn't make it on the fucking team OR blow into a piece of metal OR move a piece of a tree and some horse ass across another piece of tree.  Seventeen...Don't fucking lie to impress people. Even stupid little shit, like saying you saw a movie and you didn't. Please, just quit fucking lying to me. I know if you're lying IMMEDIATELY! And right now, this is mostly for one person who is a particularly BAD liar! QUIT FUCKING LYING!  Eighteen...If you say you're gonna do something, DO IT! Don't fuck me over! Don't think I'll forget!  Nineteen...Some jokes go too far. Calling me Matthew? It's just fucking old. Don't be a fucking obnoxious prick and call me that. Also, shit like pouring ketchup in people's hair, talking about stuff I said in orchestra, or making fun of my hair, IT'S FUCKING OLD! The Gaytown shit is REAL FUCKING old! You wanna make fun of someone? Go make fun of Katie, she's fucking used to it. Stay the FUCK off of me!  Twenty...Black people, especially one in particular, if you call me a honky ONE more fucking time! Just fucking watch me! We don't go around call you niggers, so quit fucking thinking we're the fucking bad guys. We fucking let you guys go, quit yellin at us, at least we didn't send you back to fucking Africa. We're not the racist ones, so quit thinking we're the evil ones here.  Twenty-one...Quit being so fucking conceited! Yeah, that's you fucking whores! Ashlee, Edna, Brittany the Fat-Ass, Amber, Kim, Lindsey M, Natalie, Mandy, it's fucking bull shit how much you sluts care about looks and boys and hickies and all that useless BULL SHIT! You're all gonna get raped before ya hit sophomore year. And the sad part is....most of you deserve it.  Twenty-two...All you fucking preppies. Listen, we know what the fuck is wrong with you guys. You pretend to be nice to everyone, and when you talk to us, you treat us awesome, then another Preppy comes and you fucking push us away, even if one of us is in the middle of a sentence. So pay attention to 23 you Preppy assholes...  Twenty-three...Never judge a man or woman until you have walked a mile in his or her shoes.  I won't say names. Because all of you know that if you apply, you apply. However, most of you will deny. Hmmm....and if you deny, you're under number 17, for lying. Don't be a fucking jackass.  One more thing before I go...All of you say I can come to you with shit. I can vent. I can let stuff go. I can spill my guts. There's only one person who I can do that too. And she can do it to me. That's fucking it! All of you other people just fucking let me down. So if you say you're gonna do something, DO IT! Quit being a fucking bitch!  Finally, a shout outs lists, to some REALLY FUCKED UP PEOPLE: Katie Clark, Amber Thwaites, Ashlee Hartsock, Brittany the Fat-Ass, Edna the Ethipian Oreo, Lindsey Ingold, Lindsey Morrical, Kim Furman, all you dumb whores....shut the fuck up, please? Seriously. We got enough slutty bitches at our school. Quit encouraging them. Also, Lindsey I, you're fucking fat, quit wearing such fucking tight clothes, it makes us all wanna puke.  As a final thought....I wish to say....that I feel a lot better now that I let shit go. Because this journal won't say, "My computer is uh....broken! Yeah, that's it! It's BROKEN!". This journal will not say, "Um...sorry, Matt....I don't have TIME." This journal will not say, "I don't really feel like listening to you right now." This journal, my new friend, listens to me and doesn't care. It's a lot better than venting to all of you fuckers.

      Now, let us discuss the Road Theory and the River Theory. Now, both of these were thought up by me. The Road Theory around last...August. Then after breaking up with Katie, the River Theory popped in my head as I sat down at the creek contemplating whether to keep going or just give up on life.  The Road Theory was my little way of telling myself that we all had control over our lives, and that we all had the power to make ourselves happy. The theory was that we're all on a road, and this road signified life. We all had a car. We could choose when to go back, forward, stop, what kind of car, etc. etc. The thinking behind is was that we're all goin to the same place. So take your time, pick a good car, and go. Can't go wrong, right?  Wrong.  Katie dumps me. People yell. I hate Katie. I hate everyone. This was back in August.  I realized that I wasn't on a road. I didn't have any control over my life. I just had to....let shit happen to me, ya know? Shit happens, and ya gotta take it and be happy. So here we go...Life ain't a fuckin road, it's a river. You just gotta go with the flow. Whatever happens, happens. Quit bitchin though, because everyone else is going down the same exact river. Maybe they take breaks at different times. And yeah, sometimes you will crash and you gotta get back in the boat. But either way, we all end up at the end. And if we were smart enough along the way, we'll be okay when we get there. If we hurt ourselves, or even  purposely  did something to hurt ourselves (e.g. drugs, alcohol, smoking) then we're gonna be fucked up when we get to the end of the river. But if you're smart, you'll get there, and it'll be good. Meet your friends that are already there, and wait for the ones that aren't. Just don't be the jackass that purposely tips the boat.

      Teenagers just wanna be accepted. We all...want to be important, to someone. When you get to be this age, you just feel this PRESSURE! You don't know what the pressure is from, or what it's for, it's just you feel like you should be doing something important with your life, when you know you cant. Just the teenage mind makes us think we're working for something, like we something to someone. There's a lot of "some"s in that sentence....mostly because we really don't know WHAT we're supposed to do, for WHOM, or WHY.  Just some thoughts, ya know? Different from worries though. Worrying means you're hoping something will not happening. Thoughts are you imagining what  could  happen. I'm trying to put this into my life. I'm gonna stop worrying about things so much, especially little things not worth. Just think more, instead of worrying bout every god damn thing.

      Oh my god! How can one person be so AWESOME!? Alright, Nikki gets online, we talk for two hours, and in the middle we had this big serious talk about apologizing and worrying and stuff like that. Then it was resolved and it just kinda...disappeared, and we got all happy and hyper and stuff and had this big "goodbye" it was so fucking COOL! I love her soooooooo much, no body has any idea. I'm always just in this awesome, care-free mood all the time because I got her! Nothing can TOUCH me, man! I'm fucking invincible and it feels awesome! Man, I still got some stuff goin on in my life, but it all seems so...secondary, because I got Nikki. It's just indescribable! I feel like I can...run a thousand miles just SCREAMING out my love for her, or jump over a building and lift something really heavy, perhaps the building I jumped over.  Urgh, I can hardly write, she's on my mind, and I can't get her out. And if I could...I wouldn't want to.

      I get home early, YAY, take a shower, YAY, get a pop, YAY, hear that some person who thinks I'm her friend called my girlfriend a bitch, Y- WHAAAT!? Yeah, exactly what I said. She comes up and is like "Next time I see your fucking girlfriend, I'm gonna kick her ass" I'm like "Why?" she goes "Well...I called her a bitch and she got mad". Well, you know, people can work stuff out. I had a rough weekend.  I fell asleep Saturday with Nicole's picture in my hand. Had a dream about her Friday and Saturday night. Thought about her all day. I actually talked to people about her. She was just....totally on my mind. I know it was only a few days but I missed her so much, and I can't wait until she gets online here and I get to talk to her. I wish I had her with me this weekend....I needed her so bad.  Okay. In our scout troop, I'm a patrol leader, so I'm pretty high up authority-wise. This weekend, I was the oldest guy there, besides the adults, because Josh (age 17) left in the middle of Saturday. So it was me, the adults, and 7 kids that I had to look out for. Most didn't have problems. There was Nicky (my little brother), Kevin, Adam, Justin, and Isaih. They were really well-behaved. So in turn, I had a lotta fun with those guys, and they like hangin with me because I treat them well for behaving. Then there's little Matt. His mom was on the campout, so obviously he didn't act up as much as usually, but we still had some problems.  Then there's Elizah. Alright, he's Isaih's older brother. OLDER brother. Isaih is going into 6th grade, Elizah is going into 7th. DO NOT FORGET THESE FACTS! Okay, now, about Elizah. He's a small kid with glasses who can't say his "R"s. Oh well, right? I'm just a "fuckel" to him anyway. So Saturday night/early this morning, he wakes me up and goes "Matt I can't breathe" and I go "Well, you look healthy to me". And he goes "no, I'm too stuffy and I can't sleep."  I say, "Elizah, it's 4:30, I know you slept some."  I know he's lying, but he keeps going, "Nope, I didn't sleep at all, because I can't breathe through my nose."  I'm pissed. "Breathe through your mouth, Elizah."  "Then I can't sleep."  I'm more pissed. "What do you want me to do then!?"  "I need a decongestion."  Fine, sounds good, okay, um... "Do you have any with you?"  "No."  "Does anybody have any?"  "No."  "Want me to go buy some for you?" I was sarcastic.  Well, the kid's not too bright...at all. "If you can."  "I was kidding!!! Go to bed!"  I roll up my sleeping bag over my head. Annoying little prick....So the next morning (this morning), we pack up everything and we're ready to go. Before we leave, we always "police" the area. In this, we line the kids up side-by-side and walk SLOWLY SLOWLY and pick up trash on our way. I was the Leader, so that meant...if they walk past me, that person has to go back to the beginning and start over. The first time through, no problems. So I brought the guys back over a second time, the other way, to make sure we didn't miss anything.  Elizah, Justin, and Nicky pass me.   I say, "Justin and Nicky and Elizah...start over."  Nicky and Justin go back laughing. No big deal! We get to go again, yay! For real, they didn't care. Elizah didn't move.  "Go back to the beginning, Elizah."  "No." Stubborn twit!  "Don't test me, Elizah, go back."  Pause.  He says quietly, "You don't test me."  WHOOOOA! Better call the fire truck, Matt, because you just got BURNED! Just kidding, this kid's fucking had it with me.  I get in his face. "Go back and start over."  "If I start over, I'm skipping over all my trash."  "GO! BACK! AND! START! OVER!"  "No."  I look around and say, "Fine, everybody starts over."  Moans and groans from everyone, various "Elizah, why'd you do that!?" kinda stuff. So we're about to start over. I say, "Nobody pass m-"  "I'm leaving," says Elizah.  And indeed. He leaves. He WALKS away. I yell, "Elizah! Elizah!!! ELIZAH!"  Then I start going after him, and I look back and say, "Star policing, don't pass Kevin." Kevin's my assisstant patrol leader.  Blah blah blah Elizah, stop doing this blah blah blah He cries blah blah blah Somebody shoot this kid, please. If not, I'll do it, cuz I really want to.  So there's my weekend for you...YAY!  "Beware! Criminal!" by Incubus just started playing on my playlist and I'm outta here, baby!

      I regret going out with Katie as much as anyone can ever regret anything they do. I don't know why she kept pulling me back, but for some reason I was with her for a long time. She's really the only person in my life right now that I dislike to the point that I can just cuss her out and tell her.  She's really manipulative. People are all figuring her out and ditching her lately, because she controls you. I should start callin her Adolf, just to see what she does....  I'm just really mad right now about her copying my writing crap. That's fucking bull shit, man. Makes me real mad. I'm sure if Katie tried really hard, she could be a good person, and not be such a fucking BITCH to EVERYONE! But...she doesn't try...at all....

      Before I continue trashing the report card manufacturers from Hell, I wish to point out that after today, we have 79 days of summer left. That's a big jump. Last year, on June 4, there were only 74 days left. Now if you had five extra days, what would you do?.....  ......  ......  ......  You're supposed to be thinking with us. Come on. Hand on your chin, elbow on your knee, eyes squinted, and looook up!  ......  ......  ......  Wow, five days really isn't that long is it? DAMN YOU SCHOOL FUCKERS! Why can't school start like September 23th, the day before my birthday. Or October 9nd. Or November 5rd.   Now, I wish to discuss absent days. It says here.... YEAR TO DATE          Enrolled  180.000  days          Absent  6.000  days          Attended  174.000  days  Now....why are they all ".000"? I do not know! Let's say I miss.....thirty seven thousandths of a day. That would be fifty-three minutes and seventeen seconds. So if I missed 6.037 days, I would not be missing the forty hours it said I missed. (We attend six hours, forty minutes a day). I would be missing forty hours, fifty-three minutes, and seventeen seconds. Now....what if I missed six-hundred-seventy-two thousandths of a day? That means I missed nine-hundred-sixty-five and sixty-eight hundredths of a minute that day. Which is 16.128 hours. That's 16 hours, 7 minutes, and 41 seconds. How many school days are in that? About 2.4. So TECHNICALLY!!!! If I missed 6.672 days, I really missed 8.4 school days.   Confused yet?....Me too.

      It's noon. I've been up since about 11:30. I leave tonight about 5:30 or quarter to 6:00 to leave for the camping trip. We have to be at the scout lodge at 6:00. I don't get to talk to Nicole until Sunday afternoon!  We were up until 4:30 last night. I would have stayed up later, but she was getting tired, and I wanted to get a reasonable amount of sleep due to the fact that we go to be between 10 and 11:30 on campouts. But our conversation was  so  fun last night, it was awesome. It was just....really really cool, everyone should deserve to have a night like that with the one they love. Where everything is perfect, nothing is bad, and you just have fun for 8 hours.  We made plans for Wednesday. Obviously, we haven't talked to our parents yet, but the plan--if it goes through--would be for her to come over some time in the afternoon. We'd watch Ocean's 11, because she hasn't seen it, and because I haven't seen it in a few years, and because that's just an awesome fucking movie. After that, we were gonna take my little brother to go see The Day After Tomorrow.  PLUSSSSS! Kelly and Niko (they're going out) are asking me and Nicole to go see Spiderman 2. First....Spiderman 2 don't come out till June 30, dudes. It's only like June Four. Yeah, not June Thirty. I can't make plans that far in advanced, because then I keep THINKING about it and ANTICIPATING it and I get JITTERY and stuff! But that  does  sound really cool. Niko's like my little brother, he's an awesome guy, and Kelly and Nicole just started hanging out recently and they're getting really close. That'd be fun to get us four together for a night, but if there's enough Mountain Dew around, you know  some  random building will get burned down or  some  catastrophic illegal event put in place by four crazy teenagers will happen. We all get CRAZY when we're hyper, and I'm thinking after we see that movie, which sounds cool, we're gonna do something REALLY stupid and  probably  get arrested.......This sounds awesome!  I got my report card today with my final grades for schooooooool. Allow me to list them. Instrumental Music - Strings : A+ Family and Consumer Sciences : A (Don't ask, I had to take it) Science 8                    : A+ Social Studies 8             : A Integrated Math 1&2          : A Language 8                   : A+  And along with  that , I got comments from teachers reading "EXHIBITS GOOD STUDY HABITS, CONSCIENTIOUS WORKER" and "DISPLAYS COURTESY, GOOD MANNERS & A POSITIVE ATT." I'm guessing they were just too lazy to write "and" instead of an ampersand (is that how you spell "&"?). I'm also guessing that "att." means attitude. I sure hope I didn't display a positive attack.  SCHOOL BEGINS AUGUST 23TH!? Yes!!!! And indeed, that is exactly what it says: SCHOOL BEGINS AUGUST 23TH. Yes, I realize these grade report manufacturers have ignored the fact that they just said "twenty therth", thus creating a new number and lowering all of our IQ's.  But in the school year starting on the 23th, that's 5 days later than last year's starting day, which was the the 18th. And the "-th" suffix  does  belong with the number 18.  HELLO EVERYBODY AND WELCOME TO MATT BENNETT'S ENGLISH LANGUAGE CLASS!  IN TODAY'S LESSON, WE WILL DISCUSS PROPER WAYS TO WRITE NUMBERS. TAKE THE NUMBER "FIVE" FOR EXAMPLE. IT CAN BE WRITTEN AS:  5 - THE ARABIC NUMERAL FOR "FIVE"  FIVE - THE ENGLISH SPELLING OF THE NUMERAL "FIVE"  V - THE HIGH ROMAN NUMBERAL FOR "FIVE"  AH, YES, FIVE IS A GREAT NUMBER. NOW LET US USE FIVE IN ANOTHER WAY. PERHAPS YOU ARE IN A RACE, AND YOU COME IN FIFTH PLACE. YES, THAT  DOES  MEAN YOU REALLY SUCK AT RACING, BUT LET'S JUST USE THE NUMBER "FIVE" FOR THIS.  "FIFTH PLACE" MEANS THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE IN FRONT OF YOU. (FOUR IS THE NUMBER BEFORE FIVE) YOU CAN WRITE THIS AS "FIFTH" OR "5TH".  LET US DISCUSS INCORRECT WAYS TO WRITE NUMBERS.  23TH 5RD 9ND 7ST  DO NOT MAKE THESE MISTAKES, AND YOU WILL BE ON THE ROAD TO GOOD...UH...NUMBER WRITING HABITS?  Class dismissed!

      It took me a long time to realize who Katie was. Too long. Way...too...long. I went out with her  god  knows how many times. To me, though, it never meant much. I didn't tell her this, obviously, because I kinda wanted to be with her. I didn't want it to MEAN anything, I just...wanted a girlfriend, ya know? I know that sounds really shitty, but she  did  help me out with some problems.  However, she created a lot more than she helped with. Let's take a little idea of hers called Operation Mayhem, meant to mock something from Fight Club. She could have been a LITTLE bit less of a dumbass, and earned a LITTLE more respect, if she would have just NAMED IT CORRECTLY! It's  PROJECT  Mayhem, not OPERATION Mayhem. As you can see, she's not very smart....  Anyways, Operation Mayhem was her plan to break up Kelly and Jeff. This was last August. Well, it worked. She did it. And felt damn proud of it too. Don't ask me, I had gotten rid of her before the main part of Operation Mayhem ever commenced and spilled into my so-called "relationship" with her. So Kelly and Jeff were split, all because Katie wanted to feel better about herself.  Well....about a month ago, in the beginning of May, I heard a little diddy about the bitch wanting to do Operation Mayhem 2. Her targets? Nicole and Matt. Did it work? FUCK NO!  The setting is an elementary school carnvival. The school that Katie and Nicole attended, but Nicole was a grade lower than Katie. Nicole is there with her friend, Storm. Katie is there with Sarah, and Katie's gothic boyfriend Cory, who is a MAJOR asshole. Nicole had NOTHING against Katie that night. In fact, she thought Katie was her friend. Well, Katie's giving dirty looks to Nicole, calling her a bitch and stuff. So Nicole asks Sarah whats goin on. Sarah tells Nicole about how Katie wants to "bust Nicole's jaw" and shit like that. Nicole walks by later, comments, "Bust my jaw, bitch!", and goes on with her life.  That was about two months ago. Since then, I've probably told her off....ten times. It helps a lot, because I know how much she deserves it. She's got this little....third grade treehouse club. Whenever she doesn't like someone, she'll make sure that EVERYONE she knows doesn't like that person either. It gets damn annoying.  And now, she copies everything I do. Everything I do for attention, she does too. I'm writing a book called 6:10, coming out Fall 2004. She's writing some shit about names thats comin out in the winter, and she has to announce it to everyone. BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Wanted to get this little post in before I head off to my violin lesson. When I get home, I get to write in my book, work on the big novel comin this fall,  6:10 . It's based on the Bible verse, 1 Timothy 6:10, that says "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." It's told through 8 different perspectives, switching around each chapter, and it tells the story of these 8 people all after this suitcase with a million dollars cash in it. It's really really fun to write and I'm showing Nikki as I go, she's gonna be the only one who's gonna be able to read it.  And see...I write because that's my life, that's what I wanna do for the rest of my life. Now, here comes Katie, who everyone hates now, including me. I'll give you more details tonight. And  she  is writing a book, just to like...you know...copy me and get attention. So I'm just gonna let her. In fact, I'll read it. Paper burns FAST, but it burns hot. See ya tonight!

      It's like 10 til 1:00, I just got up. Last night, I was up til about 5:15 with Nikki. We talked about EVERYTHING! It was really cool. Whenever we stay up that light, we usually just have this big deep conversation, and it was really awesome last night, because now I feel so fucking happy!  She told me I never seem happy anymore. And I noticed that, too. I don't even know WHY, I was just...down all the time. But now, because of the conversation with her last night, I feel almost motivated. It's an awesome feeling. There was just all these...questions I had in my head, as to what was gonna happen with me and her, and if we're gonna make it. And I flat out said, "Are we gonna be okay, Nicole?" She kind of paused and she said, "Yes."  She has no idea how much I care about her, seriously. She's like...my reason for everything I do. And she knows this. It's not justa bout her needing me, even though I talked about that on an earlier post. I NEED HER! My happiness and my entire life...rely on her. She just makes me feel invincible, like I can take on the world. I love her so much, and I'm not afraid to say that at all. I LOVE NICOLE!!!!!!! Get used to it, because I'll be saying that for a  long, long  time.  Today, about four o'clock, I'm doing a shakedown with my little brother. This weekend, we are going up to Salomonie Reservoir with the Scout Troop. We leave Friday night about 6:00 and get back Sunday aBOUT noon. The Thursday before a shakedown, from 7:00 to 8:00, we meet at the lodge and go through all of our gear to make sure everything is ready for the campout.  Well, on Thursdays, I have violin lessons from 7:00 to 7:30. My little brother has viola lessons with the same teacher from 7:30 to 8:00. We only have this schedule in the summer, our lessons move back to Tuesday in the fall. But that means that this entire summer, we aren't goin to any shakedowns. So at 4, we're having one in our living room, just to go through what goes into our packs.   So that's really about it. I'll post later tonight, most likely after I watch "28 Days Later". So....I'll see ya'll!

      Okay. Let's talk about life. There's three theories I'd like to present to you. The River Theory, the Road Theory, and the Learning Theory. All of these have been compiled through many,  many  hours of deep thinking. Tonight, I'll be talking about the Learning Theory. Tomorrow, or possibly later tonight, I'll discuss the River and Road Theories, because they're opposites, and it would be appropriate to discuss them at the same time.  The Learning Theory was developed just yesterday, when I was talking to Kelly....  Yes, I know that I'm not really religious, but that does not mean I deny the existance of God. I believe that the point of our lives...is to figure out why we are here. The meaning of our life is to learn our individual meaning. A part of this was expressed in a book called "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" by Mitch Albom. In this book, it describes a Heaven in which you enter upon dying, and meet five people. They can be relatives or complete strangers, but all of these people share one thing: you were of great significance in their lives.  I believe every person wants to know their purpose. We all have one, its expressed in many different religions, including Christian religions. Part of the Learning Theory is something I thought of called the Dream Effect. In it, though incomplete and easily proven false, a person lives their entire life....in a dream. You live out everything, then wake up on some random day when you're like....eight years old or something. Now for the first part...what happens when you wake up? Secondly...what would you do if you  did  wake up? Well, I believe that some people have woken up. These people have lived their lives, and have died. When they died, they woke up.  They died because they learned all they needed to learn. They learned that life was really about, and why they needed to be there. They learned what importance they served in people's lives and in the world. For this, God had to take them away, because this knowledge could not spread. However, God can not stop one from waking up. You wake from this dream, and the memory fades as quickly as a dream does, and you forget everything.  But what if you remember long enough? What if you realize what your life is about, or if you realize taht something bad will happen, because this dream just told you everything about your life? I believe that this is a cause for mental disorders...or suicide. People with mental disorders aren't LESS intelligent or capable of anything, they are MORE capable. It's almost like a form of post traumatic stress disorder. You wake up from this dream, and you know everything that will happen in your life and you know why you are there. You know all of this, and you really have no reason to live, because you....have already lived. So these people who remember their dream kill themselves, or (literally) go crazy.   Now I believe we all have this dream many times throughout our life. Sometimes in pieces, just like a regular dream. Also, some people will remember a piece, and live it, and think that they "saw the future in their dreams", and....they really did.  So we have this dream many times in our life, I don't know how many times, and we slowly remember more and more. The reason it seems like we have a dream about our day, is because events from that day stand out in this dream of our entire lives. We remember them better, because they happened recently. So when we wake up, we remember! Once you get to a certain age, you start remembering everything. You have memorized this dream through repetition. (Another piece of advice from my band teacher was "Repetition is the key to memory")  Now here you are, at your old age. In your real life, and not your dream, and you have memorized this dream because you have had it so many times. So part of this dream is the time between the current time and when you die. In this time, you learn of your significance and importance in this world. So before you die, you know what you learn, which is the reason for your death.  Here's how it goes. Say you're 98, and it's Monday. You're going to die on Thursday. You know this, because of the dream. Sometime between Monday and Thursday, you realize what life is all about. You learn why you are here. So on Thursday, God brings you up to Heaven, because if everyone knows the meaning of life, there is no purpose to life itself, and everyone would be living in vain. God takes you, and you die. You have seen this in your dream, but you memorized the dream, so you know your meaning in real life, and not just in a dream. When you realize your meaning in real life, God takes you, and you live eternally in Heaven, with all of those who share the same knowledge as you.  Once again, this is just a theory. It got me thinking, and I really hope it helps you.

      I had this band teacher throughout all three of my years in middle school. He gave me some great advice, I'll talk about it a lot in here. However, a really good one he said to me was "Practice makes permanent." His thinking behind it was that practice doesn't make perfect. If you practice something wrong, it stays wrong. If you practice it PERFECT, it will be perfect. However...it is absolutely impossible to do something PERFECT. Therefore, you can not be perfect from practicing.   I just got off the phone with Kelly, after an hour-long conversation about how parents don't know anything about their kids. Kelly, being an only daughter, under two older brothers, was talking about how her parents think she's a slutty whore and she just sleeps around and does all this shit to disobey her parents. It's nothing like this at all. She's never even kissed a boy...Now I asked her how many daughters her parents have had? Besides her, none. So they had no practice? Correct. So, pretty much, everything they do with Kelly is new. Yeah...that's pretty much how it is. So you can't blame them if they fuck up, right? But they don't understand Kelly! Well, kinda hard to understand her if they don't talk, huh? She can't talk to them, they don't care about her, she'll never be perfect like her brothers. Her brothers aren't perfect, they just didn't have it rough like her.  There's no book, no class, no video on how to parent. You just...do it. You learn from your parents, what to and what not to do. So why the hell do the kids hate us!? Because the kids, us, have other things in our lives besides our parents. None of us are sleeping around, or doing drugs. Well, not the kids I hang out with. So why I'm still not able to hang out with Nicole alone? Why am I still not able to go to people's houses without a parent there? Because they don't trust me. Even though I have done  nothing  to break that trust, their childhood and the "all teenagers fuck each other, drink, and have sex" media make them feel like we're just gonna fuck each other til our tits sprout and our balls drop, then go get high til the house fills with smoke, then we'll all go get drunk and fuck some more.  Here's a little bit to some parents out there: Talk to your kids. Get to know them. Communication is the basis of trust. Your kids trust you, so why can't you trust them?

      I'm a real...deep thinking mood right now. I'll have to write about it later. As for right now, I'm getting ready to go to the hair cut place. My dad and little brother are gettin one. Then we're all goin to Blockbuster to get some movies with this movie pass that lets us get like unlimited movies for 25 bucks a month.   I'm reading "Rum Punch" by Elmore Leonard. I just "The Switch" by the same guy last week. The books have the same characters, but take place (I think) 13 years apart. "Rum Punch" was made into "Jackie Brown" by Quentin Tarantino, the same guy who directed some awesome movies like "Pulp Fiction", "Kill Bill", and "Reservoir Dogs".  This summer, I'm hoping to read a book a week, at least. I'm gonna try to read a lot of Elmore Leonard, because I really really like how he writes. Last summer was Stephen King, I can't tell you how many of his books I've read. And I can't wait for the last two Dark Tower books!

      Okay, so let's get this show on the road.  Name's Matt. Yep, that's me. 14, gonna be 15 in September. You guys already know this. You know about what happened with me last summer. What you may  not  know, is that I am a writer. Okay, no I don't have a career out of it or anything. But I write, a lot, therefore...I'm a writer.  Some poetry. Little bit of journals (as you can see). But my love for writing is in fiction. I am currently writing a book, it'll be the first novel I've ever written. I'm used to writing short stories. Just this spring, the end of April, I read a short story called Dirty Gold. It was about 70 pages, and told this story of a boy named Chris who was with a girl named Heather, but felt really empty and unfulfilled. Then he met this girl named Keira, and she's everything he's always wanted, physically and emotionally, until he starts drifting away from his old group of friends.   It was cool writing it, considering how personal it was. A lot was based off actual events, all the names were changed though. I really should do that here, but oh well, huh? Everything here stays on a first name basis. As long as that's settled, privacy won't be an issue here.  I guess what I'm looking for right now is time. I'm happy with where my life is. It's just...I feel like it's just starting. I wanna finish my book, and start school, I want my life to BEGIN again. But for now, I'm happy with three months of boredom. Sure as hell beats homework.

       I'm over the anger. I'm not really mad anymore. I'm just.....hurt. Some trust is gone, and will have to be gained back. For anyone reading who has no idea what the hell im talking about, im talking about matt and my relationship with him.   Its a really long story and i really dont feel like talking about it, but i just feel really hurt right now.....   But i love him so much, and i NEED him so bad, and leaving him would KILL me. I would kill myself if i was away from him. We worked things out, we talked, and we both know some trust is gone...not a lot, but some, and it will take some time for it to come back. I would still trust Matt with my life....i seriously do. I can honestly say that i would do anything for him, and i can honestly say i trust him with my life.    That is what was in Nikki's diary entry last night around midnight. She's mad. She's told me she still is. But we're not gonna break up. And I'm gonna show her that I can be trusted. I mean, stuff like this happens, right?  Well, if you're me, it's not new. I had a big problem with lying, or covering up stuff, or not keeping my promises. But Nicole makes me wanna change. She makes me want to...be a better person, and do better things with my life. She makes me want to BE somebody.  I'm now ready to move onto the next stage of this journal, and it's going to be keeping an actual log of my actions, as well as my thoughts. This summer, I'm writing a book that I hope to get published. This fall, I start high school. I hope to keep this journal throughout this time period, because not only will I want to look back on these memories, but I want others to share them with me.

      Finally talked to Nicole. Still got trust issues, but we're gonna stay together. Because I'm gonna prove to her that I love her, and that she can trust me. So now, I have a new word, that I want everyone to read and think about.    Main Entry: hope  Pronunciation: 'hOp Function: verb Inflected Form(s): hoped; hop·ing Etymology: Middle English, from Old English hopian; akin to Middle High German hoffen to hope intransitive senses 1 : to cherish a desire with anticipation   2 archaic : TRUST transitive senses 1 : to desire with expectation of obtainment 2 : to expect with confidence : TRUST

      That was stupid of you, Matt. That was so fucking STUPID! A couple weeks ago, you tell her you're gonna tell her every time you go hang out with other girls. And what did you do? You go hang with one today without telling Nikki!   Actually, it was three girls.   Well, that doesn't make it too much better, does it, dumbass!?   I'm trying my best!   And so is she! But she feels like the controlling bitch now! You didn't tell her because you thought she'd be mad!? That's fucking bull shit! You can't just assume shit! Assuming is bad, you've fucking said it yourself.   She's not the bitch! I am! I'm the dumbass who didn't tell her.   And why didn't you tell her?   Because I thought she'd be mad.   She told you she wouldn't be. You two talked about that. She swore she wouldn't be mad. And now what? You fuck her over and you're here talking to yourself trying to deal with this shit.   At least I didn't do anything with the girls! I didn't even TOUCH them!   You fucking lied, Matt! That's the worst thing you can EVER do! You fucked her over big, Matt. Good luck earning that trust back.   I don't think I ever had that trust.   You ALWAYS had that trust! You were just too fucking paranoid to realize it! She fucking loves you, man!   Then if she does, and she doesn't dump me for this, then what? What the fuck do I do after that?   You show her that she can trust you.   How the fuck do I do that!?   Keep your promises.

      Today's piece of advice is....  If you say you're gonna do something, do it. Don't back out on your promises and guarantees. It just makes everything worse.

      I sit awaiting Nikki's arrival on AOL Instant Messager. Saw some friends today. Cheered me up, but really just rubbed the fact that I'm drifting from my friends into my face. I still care about them. I still care just as much as I did before I was with Nicole. But for some reason...I can't prove it anymore...  Wow, I sure do discuss proof a lot. But let's just not listen to me, and read these lyrics from "Say Anything" by Good Charlotte.    Here I am on the phone again and... Awkward silence is on the other end I used to know the sound of a smile in your voice But right now (right now) all I feel (all I feel) is the pain of the fighting starting up again  All the things you talk about you know they stay on my mind, on my mind All the things we laugh about they'll bring us through it every time after time, after time  Don't say a word, I know you feel the same Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything  Some say that time changes, best friends can become strangers But I don't want that, no not for you If you just stay with me we can make it through  So here we are again Same old arguement Now I'm wondering if things'll ever change you When will you laugh again, laugh like you did back when We'd make noise til 3:00 A.M. When the neighbors would complain  All the things you talk about you know they stay on my mind, on my mind All the things we laugh about will bring us through it every time, after time, after time  Don't say a word, I know you feel the same Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything  I'm fallin, I'm fallin, I'm fallin down I'm fallin, I'm fallin, I'm fallin down Down...down...down  Don't say a word, I know you feel the same Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything  (Please don't leave) Don't say a word, I know you feel the same Just give me a sign, say anything, say anything (Please don't leave) Please don't walk away, I know you wanna stay If you just give me a sign, say anything, say anything

      You gotta hold onto something. You gotta have one thing, one unbreakable linear line that runs through your life. For me, that's Nikki and my writing. Besides that...it's hard, man.  You go through life hearing problems from people, giving advice to people, helping people with their broken lives. My life runs on that gold bar, and I'm trying to help people find their's. How often have I been able to spill everything? How often have I gotten to just tell people how I feel?  I feel better helping people. It makes me feel good. But sometimes...you just gotta let everything out.

      We were walking from the Coldwater Crossing movie theatre to the Wal-Mart. In front of me and Nikki was Ross, stumbling to get out of the rain, stumbling because he was on some strong medicine for his tonsilitis. I put my arms around Nikki and immediately she pushed her head into my chest, under my neck. And she told me to warm her up.  A lotta stuff hit me right then. I just started thinking about this this morning, last night it didn't QUITE sink in. Nicole needs me. She seriously does. Without me, she'd be lost. If I hadn't been there to put my arms around her last night, she would have been walking alone. In the rain. She wouldn't have been able to lay her head on my chest, feel me kiss her forehead, or tell me she loved me. She relies on me not just physically, but emotionally. Coming to me with problems. Nicole needs me...and, even though it may not seem like it to her sometimes....I need her....

      I have no clue why she made me watch it. But yes, I watched Degrassi on The-N with Nicole tonight. It was....well.....interesting. No, I'm kidding, it was cool hangin with her. Besides the fact that Degrassi is just a Canadian 7th Heaven, it's  decent . We also watched some of Riding in Cars with Boys, which was just...WEIRD! We were over there tonight just hangin out, drinkin Sunkist and Mountain Dew, eatin Doritos and cookies. Her house is awesome. She has so much  food ! It's so cool.  She came over today, and she got to read the newest entries in here (her DSL still isn't up) and we watched Nicky play Morrowind, and I played some too. Then we went down to the bridge after dinner, had a good time there (how could I  not  have a good time with her?), then went back to her house.  And right now I'm listening to the Lostprophets CD, "Start Something". I'm just about to finish the second track, but so far it's....it's fucking awesome. It is an awesome CD. I recommend it to anyone. I had heard "Last Train Home" and "Make A Move" before getting the CD, and now I'm enjoying the other songs just as much. Aren't these guys like Irish or something? I dunno, don't ask me!  Another song I'm into right now is "Memory" by Sugarcult. ( Get back, back, back to the disaster, my heart's beating faster ) I just can't get enough of it. It's one of those songs where you're just like, "I feel you, man." You know exactly what the singer is feeling and thinking, and it just makes you go, "Wow....I'm not the only one."  That's what I love about music. It brings so many people together. So many different kinds of people, it just pulls you in and you just close your eyes and just feel it. When you're sitting there nodding your head, eyes closed, mouthing the lyrics, then you know it's a good song, then you know that you've made a connection with the singer.  This is officially the post of many-short-paragraphs. Whoa, schnykeez! It's almost midnight, man!  It's almost August ! AHHHHHHHHH! Time's flyin, man. It's goin fast. Looks like Blades of Sorrow better finish up, school's startin soon. Oh yeah, don't know if I said this yet or not, but I'm aiming to finish Blades of Sorrow by the time school starts. At least the first draft. I'm excited about it, but I'm also excited about my other projects. I can't choose a novel that I'm going to enjoy more. That's what's great about this. All these books are just a part of me, it's like choosing favorites from your kids. You just can't.  Let's just see how this goes. Maybe I'll be huge someday. Maybe I won't. All I know is that I'm gonna be remembered. When I'm gone, people are gonna remember who I was. For good reasons. Those are two things that I live by now. "Maybe" and "I don't know". What will I do with my life? I don't know. Will I achieve my dreams? Maybe.  -Matt-

      Dear Kelly and Kelli,  You better read this whole fucking note. And you better cherish it, because this is the last shit I will ever say to you two directly. You are both mother fucking whores. Let me lay this down for you two.  You both have boyfriends. Nick and Jeff are  awesome  guys. You two are fucking sluts, throwing yourself at every fucking guy in the world. Nick and Jeff deserve WAAAAY better than you fucking bitches! They don't need someone who's gonna be all over that Corey faggot, and invite him to fucking softball games and just totally ignore the fact that you both of boyfriends. I'm not gonna see Nick and Jeff get hurt. So here's my little  proposition  for you two. Oh shit, one of you is a cheerleader and the other is a blonde. Um....here's my little DEAL for you two.  You two better fucking buck up. You better fucking check yourself. Pull those napkins out of your bras, scrape all that fucking make-up off, put on some longer shorts PLEASE, and go be with Nick and Jeff, not every other guy in the world. It was very flattering to me when you two called me crying every fucking night. That's why I got rid of you. How you gonna feel when Jeff and Nick get rid of you?  Well, that's what I'm thinking about. I don't even think you two will care. I don't even think you two will give a shit. I just think you two will be like "hey, we didn't even have to do it ourselves" and go have a threesome with Corey. You two either need to quit being such fucking slutty WHORES! Or go realize who the FUCK is in your life, you fucking sluts!  I'm not the only one who's thinking like this. There are so many people who back me up in this. If you want some names, I'll give them to you.  So before I go, let me say this. I'm glad you two are gone. I'm happy without you guys. Hopefully Nick and Jeff will be happy without you two, because they deserve a girl who is gonna love them and care about them and not cheat on them and only have them around to vent on. I fucking hate you both.  Fuck you,  Matt

      Exactly four months ago, I stood in the band room at school, looked Nicole square in the eye and asked, "Will you go out with me?" She smiled, nodded, and said, "Yeah." Four months later, Nicole lives a quarter of a mile away, and her internet is broken and her phone runs out of batteries every few minutes. We have plans made for tomorrow to celebrate...well....today, but it'll still be awesome. I can't wait.  I can't get her out of my head. But I really don't want to. It's really cool just....you know....thinking about someone so much....I wouldn't have anyone else stuck in my head. It's just so awesome saying, and knowing, that she's mine. Whenever I say something like that, I'm reminded of our future together. We always talk about how long we wanna be together and how happy we are now. It's kind of scary thinking ahead, you know? High school is in less than a month, and I'm scared to death. But I'm also ready to start getting on with my life. And throughout all of this, I want Nicole at my side. I think I've been a kid long enough. I always used to say, and have even recently said, that if I had my way I would be a kid forever. But I'm kind of changing that now. I've been a kid forever. Now that I'm so much more mature (at least physically), I think it's just time to get....older, ya know? I'm already seperating myself from stressful, childish lifestyles (e.g. Kelly and Kelli). But this doesn't mean I'm gonna be all serious and stuff. I think it's just like "you're older now, get used to it." Young and fun are not synonymous. Just because I'm gonna be 15 at the end of September, doesn't mean I can't have fun. It's just time to stop with the childish shit I did for so long. Rumors, problems, lies, that's all just so.... dumb !  I don't know if anyone else noticed, but  magically  I'm 10 times happier now that Kelly and Kelli are gone. I broke their chains, and it's awesome! Kelly and Kelli were this....dark black blanket covering me and stopping me from going anywhere or doing anything. They always felt like an obstacle between me and Nicole. It seemed like they were saying, "hey, don't worry about your girlfriend, I already forgot about my boyfriend, but I'm gonna rely on you for everything anyway." I'm so glad they're gone. That obstacle between me and the girl I love is gone,  gone ,    GONE!      I feel like I can fly, I swear to God. (Speaking of God, thanks for helpin me get rid of those two, I owe ya, man.) I'm just so  happy , it's so amazing. Wow.... Onto that God subject. I still really don't know what's going on right now. I'm not going back to Christianity, I'm not gonna put  BIBLE QUOTES  all over my profile. I just...I don't know. I really  don't know  what my religious situation is right now. But that's okay, right? I got 100 years ahead of me to figure it out. We'll see.  That's why I love my writing. All of my characters have a piece of me.  Burn the Roses  is a novel that tells the story of seven teenagers, frequently telling their stories individually, and trying to get through life, and trying to keep each other. From watching their lifes go from rags to riches, and down to the Hell they were once in, the kids strive to do what  they  want in their lives, and escape the imprisonment of childhood. They all want to run free. They all want to do big things in their lives. Yet they all wanna stay together. One of the characters, Kyle, who is sort of the leader of the group, lives his life after being told that his life is only great because of a God-like entity called Chiman, and he's torn between accepting Chiman, accepting the "stronger" God, or living his life on his own, with no help. It's an extremely powerful book, and I'm really excited to write it. Until then, there's  Blades of Sorrow ,  Ms. Marks , and  Autumn Jazz .  You all know about Blades of Sorrow. Autumn Jazz is a book about a man who lost everything, and is seeking revenge against his former co-workers in Francis's crime syndicate. But after he takes everything from the people who took everything from him, what is he left with?  Ms. Marks is one I'm really excited, and was just recently thought up at Isle Royale. It's the story of Shaun Asher, an 18-year-old senior at high school only a few weeks from graduation, and planning out his next 4 years at college with his girlfriend, Holly. When one day, he meets Kellie Marks. Simple girl, nothing really special about her. Until the night Shaun went to the party. The same party that Holly missed because she was out of town. The same party Kellie Marks attended. The next morning when Shaun woke up in a shed and swore never to drink again, he realizes he's been kidnapped and is being held captive in a shed by Kellie Marks, who says she will not let him go until he agrees to marry her. So long story short, Kellie is with John, Shaun is with Holly, Kellie is obsessed with Shaun, and will not let him out of her shed until he agrees to marry her. Now the characters in this book are based off of real people, but to protect the innocent, we won't say who.  So I'm about to go eat dinner, then go to violin practice, then call Nicole, then sleep, then wake up and hang out with Nicole tomorrow in my new life of being free, happy, and alive. I have no clue what I'm doing on Saturday or beyond. Meh...who cares?

      I am writing from my computer at Doty's house. We took it over there and hooked it up to his network to play Quake 3. Then we played Legend of Zelda: Four Swords on Gamecube and watched some home videos.   Was supposed to call Nicole at 9:00....didn't. Thinkin bout her though, always am. It's not like I didn't  want  to call her, it would just really bother the guys if I did from Doty's. It's cool though. I mean, she'd understand if I didn't call for  one night . It's all good!  Tomorrow's our 4-month. I dunno how to think about it though. I'm happier than you could ever imagine, but I don't know whether these 4 months have gone by fast....or slow. It's hard, ya know? Thinking about how if stuff is gonna work, or how the hell it's gonna end up. I don't have any worries about me and her though. We'll be fine.  this is nck, i like to eat pop sicles  That was Nick (Niko). That's Kelly's boyfriend....He's not readin this now, he's shootin Doty's air-soft gun. I feel pretty torn about that couple though. Nick is a really tyte dude, he's like a brother to me. Kelly....well you all know about Kelly. Like Nick was downstairs talkin to Kelly, but we were all playin Zelda. Afterwards, he seemed kinda out of it, like the conversation didn't go too well. It probably got to the subject of her hanging out with Kelli  all  the time, or her talking to Cory a whole bunch. For those of you who don't know who Cory is, he's this freaky gothic guy the grade above us who is like fucking obsessed with Kelly. Maybe she needs someone like that....two people both obsessing over each other? She'd love that. I mean....since she's gone, stuff is better, but I don't wanna make Nick feel bad. It's nuthin against him at all, I mean you all know how cool he is and stuff, but I just....can't have her in my life.  Jeff's over at Doty's, too. Jeff is with Kelli. Again, same situation. Me and Jeff have known each other for 9 years. Jeff's  awesome , he's so cool. But he's with Kelli. I don't know anything about him and Kelli (though she did acuse me of being in their business). I just hope both of those guys do really good in life....they don't deserve girls like them. They're awesome dudes, they should get better than that. They need girls who are gonna feel the same way to them. Maybe Kelly and Kelli should just go lesbian and go with each other, nothing wrong with that.  Oh, something I haven't talked about yet. Homosexuality. I got nothin against homosexuals, absolutely nothing. That's not my thing, but I'm totally fine with people like that. You'll never see me at a gay bar, but you'll also never see me laughin at people like that.  So here I go, off to listen to some CKY, play some Quake 3 (especially the TrueCombat modification), and think of what I say to tomorrow. "I couldn't&nbsp;call because I didn't wanna bother the guys." I meant to, Nicole. I still love you!

       Scribble&nbsp;My Name &nbsp;by Matt Bennett  &nbsp; Can you please tell me now before I go? Let me stay and save this show. You have the most beautiful eyes. They took me away from their lies. I hate how they all said they cared. I hate how they all said they'd be there. I hate how none of them accepted you. I love how my friends list is down to two.  So grab your pen of fear, You never were sincere. Scribble my name off your list. Get your list of friends, I know I'm at the end. Scribble my name from your list.  We'd always get pissed when my friends bothered us, But now they're all bleeding in a pool of broken trust. I always saw it coming but could never quite know How great I would feel once they're cast out in the snow. Can you look at me now, and ignore them forever? Because they're gone now, and they're not coming back ever. We're finally alone, Nicole, they won't touch us anymore, Kelly, Kelli, you're bull shit...you are&nbsp;both fucking whores!

      This is awesome, I got my new computer and I'm super excited and happy about it. It's fucking awesome! I haven't been able to write the past few days because my old computer really just shitted out on me. I guess it knew we were gettin the new computer.  Bad news for me though....Nicole will not have internet for 8 days. We'll be able to hang out a whole bunch, she's all moved in now. I just won't be able to read her online diary or anything like that. It'll be really cool hanging out with her though.  I got scouts tonight, and I just got done cleaning a tent that we took to Isle Royale. I'll take that back and then tonight we're doing lashings. Last week we reviewed the High Adventure trip and had the guys do some lashings. But tonight, we're gonna go through and teach them the lashings really well, and have some sort of competition where you gotta build stuff.  I've reached a new level in scouting and it's really cool where I am right now. You see the troop is split into patrols. There's 4 patrols with an average of 5 guys in a patrol. For every patrol, there is a patrol leader, that's what I am. The patrol leader is someone experienced in scouting and able to help the younger scouts out as well as showing leadership skills. Every patrol leader has an assisstant patrol leader as well. Along with the patrols, there is the leadership patrol, which is all of the older guys who are not 18 yet. When you're 18, you can not be a scout anymore. The leadership patrol is the senior patrol leader (my older brother Dan), the assisstant senior patrol leader, and like the quartermaster and stuff. However, there are three guys in the leadership patrol, and two of them will be turning 18 before December, and the last turns 18 next year. This means that some scouts who are patrol leaders right now will be moved up to leadership positions. The patrol leaders are Jeremy, Joel, Bill, and I. (I've given up on the "initials only" thing) Jeremy, Joel, and Bill are all sophomores and I am at least 4 months younger than all of them. This means that they may be put into the leadership patrol before I am.   But we'll just have to wait and see. All I'm really focused on right now is going up to make dinner when I finish this post, going to scouts from 7:00 to 8:30, then calling Nicole at 9:30. After that, my schedule is free and unknown. It's pretty cool not knowing what's ahead, even if it is only a few hours. Then things happen as surprises, and new things happen, too. I guess Forrest Gump was right.....you never know what you're gonna get.

      Just got back from Nicole's house about....10 or 15 minutes ago. And I must say....um....wow. That's really about it.....wow. It was very....wow. We were in the basement, and all the lights were off and it was dark and just....I still can't even find the words for it.   I just can't think of what my life would be like without her. How BORING would it be? How LONESOME and DEPRESSED would I be? She just puts so much  life  and  energy  into my life. Without her I would just be like a drone with nothing to do and no motivation to be funny or happy. She put importance and meaning into my life, and that's something that can just never be repaid.   She always tells me my eyes look so dark and sad. She should have seen me 8 months ago when i didnt know her. She should have seen my dark eyes when I had no one to wake up to. No one to rely on. No one to love. No one to love me. Under those dark, sad eyes is the happiest man in the entire world. Looks can be very deceiving, and apparently, they are in my case. I am so happy with her. Even though I'm not always smiling and laughing, on the inside, I couldn't be happier. My eyes are dark and sad because they've seen too much. They're the boundary between my sometimes terrible life, and my incredibly happy mind. They have been witness to terrible things and amazing things. They're just worn out, exhausted. But they are no summary of my happiness. No man is happier than I am. No one ever will be. I love her.

      So it's Friday. I was supposed to hang out with Nicole today, but it turns out our plans got scooted over to TOMORROW. So that's where I'll be tomorrow night. We'll probably go down to the creek again. It was really nice last time, just hangin out down there. It's so awesome just sitting there and being able to talk to her about anything, there's no feeling like it.  I was talking to her this morning about my writing and stuff. It's so awesome how she is like.... interested ! It feels so awesome being rid of KY and KI because whenever I'd talk to them about my writing, they wouldn't give a rat's ass. No one else really cares either, just Nicole.   Just recently, I've really got a new sense of motivation for my writing, and I'm really into it and I really wanna do it now. Nicole's a big part of that. Few days ago, I was thinkin about if it wasn't gonna work, and she just laid it down and it really hit me. Now I'm back and I'm excited about it again. I mean, sometimes people just get in little worrying moods like that, ya?  I'm gonna try to get a lot done on Blades of Sorrow tonight. I currently have Anchorman downloading on a Torrent, it should be done in time to watch about 8:00 tonight. I watched Starsky &amp; Hutch and Old School the past few days, just checkin out some Will Ferrell movies. He's so fucking hilarious. 17 days until Kill Bill Volume 2 comes out on DVD!!!

      I just talked to KY online. She's done for. I am completely 100% done with her. It feels really good, but I don't think it's gonna really set in well until I talk to KI, who won't answer her phone, or just can't afford the phone bill anymore. I'm not doing this because of Nicole. I told KY everything and the first thing she said was that I was doing it because of Nicole, and I'm not. I'm doing it for myself.  I live my life for no other person. For this reason, I have decided that after KY and KI are out of my life, I'm just gonna start living. I'm not gonna impress people anymore. When I get to Northrop, I'll be myself. But even though I'll be in high school, I won't lose track of Nicole. I don't care if I meet 500 hot girls and all of them wanna go out with me, I won't forget Nicole for a  second . High school is all about meeting new people, and experiencing life. And yes, I will meet new people. Yes, I will experience life. But Nicole will be right there behind me. And that is never, ever going to change.

      All I'm trying to do is reach two freaking people, is it  that  hard!? I'm trying to get a hold of KY and KI, because they both need to hear the same thing. They both need to hear the same "hey, you both have boyfriends, quit being so caught up in my life". I don't even get how I could call them friends at one time. They never gave a shit about me, it was all about having someone to drop their problems on. I wasn't someone they  cared  about, I was just some guy they went to when they had problems. Pretty soon, they were MAKING problems, just so they could live their life inside of them. They were lying, getting into other people's business, spreading rumors, and I just lost it. I never want to talk to either of them ever again, I seriously don't. Nicole says I say that every time, and I'll just be friends with them again in two weeks, but I mean it this time. I don't want those two in my life anymore. And once I get to high school, it'll be really easy to erase them from my life.   But here's the dilemma. I definitly don't want to call them. I've never really liked calling them, and I'm not gonna start now. One of them can't afford a computer, so she will never be online to talk to. I'm  contemplating  just calling them and just doing it. It'd hit them harder and the "fuck you" effect would be deeper. Yeah, I'm kinda thinkin about it. I got more important things to do today though. Like...uh....eat....talk to Nicole....watch TV. You know,  imporant  things.   So just about.....2 minutes ago, this girl named&nbsp;LM&nbsp;(I have decided to put initials in here for people other than my family and closest friends, just to protect the innocent...well....sometimes guilty)&nbsp;sends me an instant message with all this sappy bull shit like "why did you call me a slut so long ago and why did you put me on your slut list and blah blah blah?" and I just told her "I don't judge people until I know them. I know you, and I passed judgement." This is coming from the same girl who called me a fucking bastard a few months ago for telling her to quit smoking. Hmmm...."ehhhhhh! why did you call me a fucking bastard LM!? EHHHHH!"  In my life right now, I'm in my stage of "In with the good, out with the bad." I know what I want in my life, as well as knowing what I don't want in my life. Things I  want  in my life are Nicole, my writing, people like&nbsp;Steve and Jeremy. Things I  don't  want in my life are KI, KY, all those slutty little friends that Nicole used to have, including that LM.  I think everyone has the right to their own destiny. Quoting a good TV show, "The ticket to the future is open." If something is wrong in your life, you have to power to change it. This idea of control is explained in books of mine like Dirty Gold and Burn the Roses. Do we have control of our lives? Is some higher entitiy watching over us and helping us?  I really don't know. And that's what's awesome about life. Ya just don't know anything until you live a little. All I do know is that I want Nicole in my life forever, my writing in my life forever. Besides that, the rest is pretty much a clean slate after I get rid of these bad things in my life. And you know what you do with a clean slate: put  whatever  you want on it.

      I'm sorry for not posting yesterday, and I don't know if I did the day before or not. But my computer is being really screwy right now. I've run ScanDisk, Spybot, and defragmented it, and it seems to be performing SOMEWHAT more efficient, but it's still pissing me off. So we have decided to replace the ole klinker. Yes, that's right ladies and gentlemen, Matt is purchasing a new computer. Along with his younger brother, he's buying a Dell, with a SWEET video card that'll be able to take us through all the new games coming out. (Half-Life 2, Doom 3, etc. etc.) It's gonna have an 80 gig hard-drive, and it's got a Pentium 4&nbsp; 3.0 Ghz processor. For those of you non-nerds out there, just disregard all the "technical" terms being used here. Long story short, it is a NICE computer. It's gonna be pretty phat and I'm really excited about it.  Tonight, I went to a softball game with Nicole, then went back to her house for a while and hung out with Ashley (Nicole's little sister), Heather (Nicole's older sister), Tyler (Heather's boyfriend/ex-boyfriend, no one really knows), and Miranda (god I hope that was her name, I'm bad with remembering names, but she's Heather and Tyler's friend). We all hung out at the Griffetts Household and played uncomfortably childish games such as Duck-Duck-Goose and Uno. It was a really cool night, but me and Nicole didn't do anything physical besides hold hands in the car on the way back from the softball game. But that was part of why tonight was so awesome. We didn't  have  to do physical stuff to have fun tonight. We just....had fun! It's so great being up to like sit on the bridge with her or go see a movie with her, but it was just as awesome doing stupid crap like Duck-Duck-Goose and running around in a storm. Just being around her, being with her, it's so amazing. Just sitting there in the basement, my back against the wall, Tyler Heather Ashley and Miranda playing Uno, Nicole laying down with her eyes closed in front of me, and me just staring at Nicole and not being able to stop....I couldn't help myself. I was just thinking about how lucky I am to have a girl like her. So beautiful, so fucking gorgeous. And also so lucky to have such an  awesome  girl as mine. My look on this was that if she has the personality of an angel, and the body of an angel, what's she doin down here on Earth?  That's a new thing I've been thinking about. I was on the phone with Nicole tonight and I just kinda froze when this idea hit me and I didn't say anything for a minute or two. I think everyone on Earth feels the work of an angel at  some  time. Whether it's as personal as having them as their life partner, or just having someone--maybe even a complete stranger--do something great for you. And maybe...everyone is an angel. I really just don't know. We're all God's children, right? Aren't we  all  angels at  some  time? Think about it. Everyone has that ONE person that  totally  changes their life and shows them what they have to do, and shows them who they really are. Whether it's something small or big, everyone has that person. That person is like an angel, a messanger of God, delivering the message from the big man sayin something like "hey, I still know you're there, I'm watchin over you still".   My depiction of God is just a normal guy. Someone who you can just be like "hey" to. My God isn't this all-powerful, all-mighty omniscient being...he's just...well....God. A lot of this is told in one of my books, but there's a line in there where the main character is talking to God, and he says "Do I have to follow you? Why do you force so many people to?" and God replies, "I do not force people to follow me. The people who follow me...force people to follow me."   I'm slipping back into something. God seems closer than he used to be. But I feel like I'm less in my "I don't like God" stage to getting closer to him. Not like being a Christian, I don't think I'll ever be able to find myself in that stage again, but more like...accepting him. I don't know if I'm ready to start praying again...but for now, I'm alright with him bein there. He's a cool guy. And I hope in the future me and him can get closer. Not to the point where I can convert, but at least to where I'll be able to start praying again. You hear that, big guy? You're not such a bad dude after all.

      Just kinda hangin around the house for a little bit. I'm waiting for my e-mail address to be verified on the Gunbound servers, which I just started playing yesterday. I must say, it's a very fun game. It plays just like Worms, but it's cooler....and free. &nbsp; Went over to see Nicole's new house today. I feel kind of bad, because I wasn't expecting much, but it was an AWESOME house! Holy crap, seriously, it is the coolest place. It's got this....simple classy style to it and it's so cool. But I saw the new house today, and me and Nicole went down to the bridge by the creek again today, just like we did yesterday. We were doing stuff, like physical stuff, which was totally awesome because it's been a while. But most of the time was just sitting there with our feet over the bridge. I had my arm around her and she was all snuggled up underneathe and we were just talking.  &nbsp; It's not just about the physical things we do. I love doing them, but it's not the entire relationship. Sitting there today was so cool because I was just with her and we were just talking normally. I can talk about anything with her and it's so freaking awesome. With other people, I avoid talking about certain subjects because I don't wanna sound "soft" or like a "nerd". Around Nicole, everything I talk about....she cares about and is interested in and talks with me too. Sometimes it's cool just to sit there and listen to her. I'm a better listener than a talker, and she's got a  beautiful  voice. But I like the fact that I don't have to hold back on her. &nbsp; When we first met, I told her not to cut me any slack. She took this and kept it for so long. Even today, she doesn't hold back on me, and she doesn't feel the need to glorify me as a weak person or anything. She just does what she does, and I love  everything  about her and  everything  she does. She's  NICOLE  around me. She's herself and she's not different or trying to impress me. She did enough impressing me on the day we met. If I hadn't seen that (impressive)&nbsp;smile that made me want to keep talking to her on the bus that day we met, would I be with her today?

      Yes, she is moving into the new house this week. Today, the family is over there doing stuff so I'm gonna go over there and hang out with Nicole and maybe help the family if they need it. Her parents are really really cool, seriously. They're not like the strict parents I got. &nbsp; At Isle Royale I was talking to the other guys about my parents, and they would tell me about theirs. I even talked to the adults. This took place Saturday on the Rock Harbor docks. In everything, my parents were more strict, yelled me, had more rules, but gave more money. That's really the only thing that is keeping me from going "Mom, Dad, you guys suck"&nbsp; is the fact that I get a lot of money from them, 16 dollars a week. I mean, I'm sure they care about me, but it just seems like they're kinda eager to get rid of us. In the car, Jeremy was reading The Stand by Stephen King and his book mark was a note from his mom that said like "Have a great trip, Love Mommy". As dumb as that sounds, I thought that was really cool. And it meant something to him. She was trying to be over the top with it, but it was important to him. My mom wouldn't do that for me in a million years. &nbsp; I'm not saying I'm ungrateful for the things I have. I have a great house, and I have pretty much everything I'd ever want. My guitars, computer, video games, my  huge  book collection. I mean....people in other countries couldn't even dream about having these things. It's a struggle to  survive  in some places, and for me it's just about hanging out in the house. I am extremely thankful for everything I have and own and for all of the privelages I have because a lot of people  don't  have what I have. I'm not gonna rub that fact in their faces and I'm not going to parade my belongings around just to provoke jealously. I just have more things than other people, but that doesn't change me as a person. There are many things in my life that are more important than  any  of these things. But my life is lived through these things. My guitars (as dumb as this sound) are like friends to me. I can let out anger and frustration when I play, or just relax and play something more mellow. My computer lets me write and talk to people. &nbsp; It's not about what  things  you have, it's about who you are. The things you have are just....things. I am so grateful for everything I have, and I will never take them for granted. Especially after going to Isle Royale and learning that 9 days without all these things can be the most fun thing you will ever do in your life. The priceless things in my life, like Nicole and my ambition to write, are no match to my material possessions. If I had the choice of living in the greatest house ever without Nicole or my writing, or living in poverty  with  Nicole and my writing....I would choose the second one before you even finished asking me the question.

      (This was all written on Sunday, July 18, not while I was on the island)    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    Day 1 (Saturday, July 10,  Drive Day ): Drove 12 hours from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Copper Harbor, Michigan.&nbsp;I&nbsp;rode in&nbsp;Mr.Lennart's car. Mr.Lennart is in his 50's (I think) and he's about 5'8" with a short beard and short hair. He's a stocky guy, but you know it's all muscle. He's a really campy, outdoorsy guy. He's really funny when he's in a good mood, and he has some great pointers for people. He drove the entire 12-hour trip. In the shotgun seat was his son, Josh Lennart. Josh is ALMOST 21 years old, and he'll be a junior at Purdue this fall. He's an Eagle scout, but also a typical college kid. Getting drunk, listening to music, seeing movies, but he's actually a really cool guy to talk to. In the backseat with me was Jeremy and Bill. Jeremy has been a good friend of mine for a few years now. We have the same interests and he's just a really fun guy to hang out with. He's the kind of guy that you can just like kick back and talk with. He's an awesome HANG-OUT kind of friend. Bill is a skinny kid with bushy blonde hair and gets really hyper sometimes. Funny kid, really optimistic and positive about everything. He's a really REGULAR guy, which I like. I don't like people who are all confusing and difficult. So throughout the drive, we three kids switch places in the backseat. Along the way, I had the Blink 182 CD, the Kill Bill Vol. 2 Soundtrack, and the Incubus CD. The Lennarts were playing Rush the entire way up on the car stereo. In the other car were the other two adults, Mr.Spears and Mr.Kirlin, and the other kids, Dan (my brother), Steve, and Josh K (not to be confused with Josh L). So we ate a sack lunch just after passing the Macinac Bridge (And a sign before then that said "C'mon over and bring the kids - God" which we just thought was  hilarious ). During lunch, we'd run after seagulls and throw food at them and run at them after throwing the food then sneaking up on them and running at them. It was pretty monotnous, but entertaining. We drove the rest of the day up to Copper Harbor pretty quietly, and checked into Lake Fanny Hooe Campground. Don't worry, we couldn't pronounce it either. After we set up tents, we went and had dinner at this nice dinner restaurant and I had the shrimp, which was really good. After dinner, we drove back to camp and hit the hay. Obviously, the entire day, images and thoughts of Nicole were roaming through my mind. I dreamed about her that night. I don't remember what the dream was about though. It's hard to remember dreams.      &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Day 2 (Sunday, July 11, Nicole's 14th Birthday,  Spoon Day ): We got up about 6:00 am Michigan Time (You have to remember that I live in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and we do not have Daylight Savings Time, so our clocks never change. Michigan, as well as Isle Royale National Park, were an hour ahead of our time in Fort Wayne, but I'm sticking to Michigan/Isle Royale Time) and went down to the docks. We loaded the packs and stuff onto the boat and boarded the Isle Royale Queen III. The ferry ride was about 4.5 hours and was jam-packed action-filled with a lot of sitting and...sleeping...and uh....sitting? Did I already say that? (Yeah Matt, you did.) Well who asked you Voice In My Head? (You did.) Shut up. ( You  shut up.) ANYWAYS! On the island, we listened to Ranger Randy (His name was Randy, and he was a Ranger, we thought that was f*cking hilarious.) talk to us about park tips, hints, rules, and regulations. It would have been boring as HELL if it hadn't been for that Canadian accent of his. Man...you don't know funny until you see an authority figure pronounce "flowers"--with the "ow" pronounced like it is pronounced in "cow"--incorrectly, and he says "flowers"--with the "ow" pronounced like the "ow" is pronounced in "flow". We laughed about that until it was time to do what pretty much everyone does on this island:   HIKE  ! We left Rock Harbor and quickly hiked three miles to the conveniently-named Threemile Campsite. The terrain is  very  rugged and  very  rocky, so it's not recommended for people who suck. At Threemile, we realized Josh L was gone, so Mr.L and Mr.K went back to go find him, and we chilled out on a dock at the campsite, until Josh walks in. Mr.L and Mr.K came back later and gave Josh a piece of their mind (with some words that aren't quite Boy Scout appropriate). After Threemile was the 4.2 mile trek to Daisy Farm Campsite, where we would be staying that night. We got there, set up camp, and realized that Dan had lost the troop spoon, the only cooking utensil that would be used this week. For dinner (just as we did everyone night on Isle Royale) we had Richmoor dehydrated just-add-water dinners. It tastes like horse sh*t, but it fills you up. However, everything during the week had to be cooked with a spoon. Fantastic. I went to bed thinking about Nicole. About how happy she must be that it's her birthday and that me and her will be the same age for a few weeks. About how sad she must be that I wasn't there for her birthday. Before I fell asleep, I whispered to her, apologizing and wishing her a happy birthday. I don't know if she heard me.    Daily Mileage: 7 miles    Total Mileage: 7 miles     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Day 3 (Monday, July 12,  Moose Day ): What a way to start the day than to see a 1000-pound female (cow) moose eating and grazing through your campsite at Daisy Farm. "Hello Mrs.Moose" "F*ck you, I'm eating!" After the moose left, we all got up and had breakfast. Breakfast all week consisted of Nutrigrain bars and cereal bars (like Chex, Cocoa Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Cheerios, all conveniently starting with  C ). We began our hike to Moskey Basin, where we stopped for a water break and sat on the dock and picnic table for a while. While on the dock, me, JoshK, and Mr.K saw this  huge  trout, had to have been....30 inches, no lies. We got some water from Lake Superior, which is not completely clean (or we just cannot trust its cleanliness) and we had to add iodine (Polar Pure) droplets. 25 minutes after those were put in, the water was good as new. I took two Nalgenes with me on the trip. Nalgenes are 1-quart water containers with a large drinking spot and lid, and are made of tough plastic called lexan. I had two green-tinted Nalgenes. One had a blue lid, the other a white. The blue-lidded Nalgene was named Chester, the white named Shaniqua. You go&nbsp; a little crazy on this island after a while, sorry....Best part about the week was our helpers that we all had. We were all required to have a helper with us, and they'd help us carry our stuff, and they had to be with us at ALL times. My helper's name was Elektra. She  always  wore green. It was really cool being with her all day. And we had a lot of fun together. Like she would ride on my bike and we'd have a ton of fun, and once she even stayed in mine and Bill's tent for a night! Okay, I named my pack Elektra, because it says "Elektra" on the pack. **Shrug** I don't know why. Anyways. After Moskey Basin, we went to Lake Richie and ate lunch. There, we saw this big bull moose in the middle of the lake. It kept swimming now and coming back up. Down, then up, down, then up. We figured it found some good weed down there. Seaweed that is. Moose eat plants. While we ate and watched him, a cow moose came and began eating some plants in the shallower water. In the distance, some canoers came and ultimately scared the cow moose onto land, where it walked through the woods and back into the island behind us. It was less than 20 feet away at one point. After lunch, we finished the last leg of our journey at Chippewa Harbor Campsite. At Chippewa, we went swimming. However, Lake Superior is about...40 degrees. To imagine this, fill your sink with cold water. Then put some ice cubes in. A lot of ice cubes. Let that sit for a few minutes. Then go stick your hand in. Then imagine jumping into water that temperature, getting your whole body under water. Between Lake Richie and Chippewa, I thought about me and Nicole as older people. Not old&nbsp;in age, but older than we are right now. Like in our thirties, two young kids, living in a normal house, still sharing the same young love we've had since we were in middle school. I always dreamed about being with a girl just like Nicole. Now that I dream about being with her forever, I hope that people are right when they say dreams really do come true.    Daily Mileage: 10 miles    Total Mileage: 17 miles     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Day 4 (Tuesday, July 13,  Rain Day ): Oh, and did it rain. Man, it poured. We hiked out of Chippewa and back-tracked about 4 miles before ending up at Lake Richie (again) for lunch. By then, all was dry and well, and we sat around drying our clothes and such. In Lake Richie was a&nbsp;cow moose. I thought it was a bull so I offered to name him Buster. But it was revealed to me politely by Steve that it is a cow. ("Do you see some antlers and a dick on it?") So we named her Bustelina. We continued hiking until we got to West Chickenbone Campsite. The decent into West Chickenbone was a 1/3 of a mile trail that decends about 500 feet, and is made entirely of rocky switchbacks. If you don't know what switchbacks are....it is  extremely  difficult to climb up or walk down a mountain on a straight trail. So instead of going straight up or down a mountain, which would be a very short but very steep trail, there are switchbacks, which are trails that zig-zag back and forth, slowly taking you up or down, but the trails are almost level so it is much easier to hike. This hike down to West Chickenbone sucked though because the switchbacks were steep because of such a sharp decent, so that was pretty crappy. It was worse in the morning...when we had to climb back up. That day, I got the idea for a new novel, finished the idea for an old one, and realized that I was gonna be with Nicole forever. It was about "I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope" anymore. I  know  now that this is right. She's as perfect as anyone can get. Hm....I slept well that night.    Daily Mileage: 9 miles    Total Mileage: 26 miles     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Day 5 (Wednesday, July 14,  Canada Day ): We woke up really early Wednesday morning, we had the longest day of the trip ahead of us. It was a 12-mile day, and we would be reaching the highest point on our trek: 1206 feet. We left early so we wouldn't be on the ridge in the hot afternoon. On this ridge though....it was amazing. We looked out to Lake Superior. To the south, all water, and the island we had hiked around. To the north, Canada, which we all flipped the bird to and began talking about the South Park movie, which has a Canada-based theme to it. It was a tough day, it really was, but I liked how the group began to spread and leave space between each other, and I almost felt like I was hiking alone. I had a lot of time to think about stuff. It was really really cool. We stopped for lunch for about two hours (our longest lunch break) and Steve and JoshL went ahead to get a good spot at the campsite we were heading to for that night, Todd Harbor. At Hatchet Lake, where we stopped, it was .2 miles to the bathroom. Obviously, we all walked the .4 total miles to get there and back. Ah....nothin like hikin with empty bowels. Also at lunch, I replaced the duct tape on my feet. Duct tape? Okay, here's the situation. When you hike, if your socks get wet or sweaty, it increases your chance of getting a blister, which are fluid-filled things on your skin caused by friction. Before you get a blister, you get what's called a "hot spot". The skin will be read and will feel hot. This is when you should treat it, not after you get the blister. My treatment: duct tape. I put a strip of duct tape on each heel, put my socks and boots on, and went on the rest of the week without any blisters. I picked the duct tape trick up from Mr.L. At Todd Harbor, we got the good campsite we wanted. A sunny, breezy campsite next to the water. The beach had this big black rocks that everyone hung out on and washed their clothes at. That's the day I took my shirt off for six hours and eventually got TAN. Yes, not pale, not white, TAN! Some people swam, I didn't because I did at Chippewa. I slept very well that night. Why? I had a dream about me and Nicole....you can fill in the rest.   Daily Mileage: 12 miles   Total Mileage: 38 miles    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Day 6 (Thursday, July 15,  Sh*tty Campsite Day ): Todd Harbor to East Chickenbone was the worst of the hikes. It was boring. It was slow. No animals. No good scenery. Thursday was really a crappy day. What made it even crappier was that it rained when we got to East Chickenbone 9 miles later. But it doesn't earn the title of sh*tty until we realize that the East Chickenbone campsite just f*cking sucks! It's dry, no tables, all rocky, out in the open. It's everything you don't want from a campsite aside from screaming babies or superwolves who eat you when you sleep. (Superwolves are not real.) It rained that night as I slept on a slope and heard my pack get soaked and I drifted off to sleep imagining Nicole coming and somehow getting me off this island.   Daily Mileage: 9 miles   Total Mileage: 47    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Day 7 (Friday, July 16,  Last Full Day ): On Friday, we climbed on top of this ridge and saw Thunder Bay, Canada. Thunder Bay was 50 miles north of us. So people in Fort Wayne, imagine standing on your roof and seeing Gas City from there. 50 miles is a HUGE, HUGE distance to see. It was truly an amazing site, and one of the many things that made this trip worthwhile. We stopped at Mount Ojibway on the last day, a 12-mile day, and climbed this observation tower, which also gave us a very cool view of the island. We could even see Rock Harbor from the tower, it was cool seeing  some  sort of civilization. We ate lunch at Daisy Farm, where we stayed the first night on the island, then finished the day by staying at Threemile. On the dock, JoshL bet me two dollars I wouldn't cannonball into the the 40-degree water right off the dock. I made two dollars that day. We slept very soundly that night, and I thought about Nicole again. And once again, it was all good thoughts. I was happy.   Daily Mileage: 12 miles   Totale Mileage: 59 miles    &nbsp;  Day 8 (Saturday, July 17,  Polish Hamburgers Day ): We hiked the final three miles in one hour and three minutes. That's twenty-one minutes per mile. For a group of people fatigued from a week of hiking, that's really good. At Rock Harbor, we bought shower tokens and we all go to take showers and change into clean clothes, which was nice. Not nice for ourselves, but nice to others. We didn't smell anymore. We all went to get lunch at this restaurant where some Polish people worked, it was very awkward. But the hamburgers and french fries were the best I've ever had....or maybe that's because I had eaten horse sh*t all week. The boat ride home was actually really cool. I played a game of Euchre. Then a game of Hearts. Then I sat in the back with JoshL and Steve. Now you see....Steve is gonna be a senior in high school, Josh is gonna be a junior in college, I'm gonna be a freshman in high school. Josh was about to start the career he would follow the rest of his life. Steve had just chosen his career. I have no clue what I'm gonna do. We talked about everything, and for 4.5 hours, we weren't 3 or 6 years apart, we were all equal, even if we were at dramatically different stages in our lives. I don't know what I'm going to be, but there's no pressure. I have time. I'm still young, and I'm able to take some more time to figure out what I want to do with my life. One of those guys just chose. One is putting his decision into action. My decision hasn't even been made yet. But us three guys weren't very different. We all had similar interests and we had a great time talking. It was nice hearing the same thing from both of those guys: "You have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do with your life". Back at Copper Harbor, we went to a prime rib buffet dinner, which was  delicious  and then went back to the campground. I think all the weight I lost at Isle Royale, I gained at that restaurant. At camp, we went to bed, and I whispered to Nicole: "I'm coming home tomorrow, baby."   Daily Mileage: 3 miles   Total Mileage for Entire Trip: 62 miles    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Day 9 (Sunday, July 18,  Today ): We got up at 6:00 am Michigan time and began driving. The day consisted of listening to the same CD's as the way up, eating breakfast at Hardee's, eating lunch (and  totally  pigging out) at Taco Bell, and getting back to the scout lodge about 4:45 Fort Wayne time, 5:45 Michigan time.    &nbsp;  Tonight, I went over to Nicole's new house and went down to the creek with her for a few hours. It was so awesome being with her, it was so amazing topping my week off with seeing her. She says I'll be coming over tomorrow too. But for now, I'm adding the final touch to the completion of my trip to Isle Royale.    &nbsp;  I came back from this trip tanner, happier, and smarter. I'm tan because I actually went outside instead of staying on the computer, and I truly enjoyed being in the outdoors, more than I thought I would. I'm happy because I got to really really clear my head on this trip, and I feel like someone ran my thoughts through a sifter and I feel so refreshed and excited about being back, but also having this experience. I'm smarter both in outdoor skills and in life skills because of this trip. The boat ride on the way home really completed it for me. 6 years of difference between us three guys, yet we're all scouts, we're all out on this trip, this  adventure . Scouting, along with teaching you handy skills that you'll use forever, also teaches you those indirect lessons about life and living. It brought all of us together, sharing something as simple as walking with a backpack on. I'm smarter not only because I learned some scouting skills, but because I learned life skills from these people. I think I have more patience after this trip, more tolerance for other people, more optimism in my head, more eagerness to go out and see the world and grab the bull by the horns and  live . In the next few years, I need to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Might as well spend those years doing incredible things...like going to Isle Royale.

      This will be my last post before I leave for Isle Royale. When I come back, hopefully I'll have a lot of stuff to tell you guys. For now, all I know is that there are nineteen wolves on Isle Royale and about 900 moose. The island is about 45 by 5 miles. We'll be going about 60 miles during the 6 days that we're there. However, it won't just be 10 miles per day, it'll be different distances throughout the week.  Thankfully, I have some pictures to accompany me on this trip. I have these two polaroids of Nicole at my house. Hopefully sometime the rest of this summer, I can use the rest of my 5 shots in that polaroid camera to get some others of her. No, not the gross pictures you're thinking of. Just pictures. The more pictures you get of someone, the better you'll be able to think of them. A picture never looks like the real person, but a lot of them will give you a good idea.  I'm excited about the trip, I really really am. I've never been on such a long trip like this before. But I  will  miss Nicole, you can't change that. Earlier today, I was thinking about what if Nicole like lost interest in me this week, or started talking to some other guy? But after talking to her a bit, I realized that me and her have the same fears. We both have like the same thoughts and actions, and it's like we can read each other's minds. Being scared that she's gonna lose interest would be useless. Because if I thought that, I know that she would be thinking I would lose interest. Therefore, since we're both thinking about each other, even if it may be worrying, we won't have time to lose interest, because the other person will always be in our mind. There's no point in worrying, since there is no way that either of us can ever lose this.  That picture is still in my head from last night. The way the light shone, the exact way that we did what we did, and I can't get this image from my head. But I don't want to. I wanna think about this, this moment is what I want to take on the trip with me. I want to think about what she said while we were doing it, and how her voice sounded. The way I sat there in Wendy's afterwards and just stared at her, and she didn't even see me doing it. The way she always looks so beautiful, no matter how you look at her.  I'm leaving this week not in sorrow, or in loss of missing Nicole, but in a good mood. I know Nicole will be thinking about me. And I will  definitly  think about her, too. I'm gonna lay there in my tent during the nights and know that she's in her bed at home, with the teddy bear I got her for her birthday on Sunday, and she'll be happy too. We won't be sad because our bodies are apart, we'll be happy because our minds will always be together.  I have a 12-hour drive ahead of me tomorrow. I am taking the CD's "Crow Left of the Murder" by Incubus, the Kill Bill Volume 2 soundtrack, and hopefully the "blink-182" by Blink 182 and Kill Bill Volume 1 soundtrack CD's if I can get them out of my older brother's car. So I have four CD's, a pocket full of pictures, and a night full of memories to last me 8 days. Considering that they all have to do with Nicole....I think I'm gonna be okay at Isle Royale.

      Why didn't I post since I got back from camp?  That's the question right now. Well....I really don't know. I guess I kinda felt like this journal was useless, and that recording my life had no point. But Nicole just changed my mind a few seconds ago, and now I realize that this is important to me, and I should keep doing this.  Yeah, things between me and her are going really really good. Though I was at camp, our 3-month was celebrated last Tuesday (the 29th of June), and I eagerly await our 4-month on July 29th, which I will be home to share with her. She'll be livin just down the road, so we can spend that whole day together if we wanted. It's gonna be really cool seeing her so much, I'm really really excited.  Last night, we went to go see a movie. What movie? Doesn't matter, we hardly watched it. The thing about last night was....not once in my mind did I feel like we were just two horny kids. The entire time I honestly felt that I was sharing my love with Nicole, and the things we did (including one new especially) seemed so passionate and amazing to me, and it was just incredible being there with her. Afterwards, we went to a Wendy's nearby and had a cool talk about the difference between our families. After that I got to get some stuff off of my chest that I've been thinking about for a while. Stuff concerning me and her I just never bothered to tell her...or was it because I could never find the words?  We were at one of the biggest screens in the theatre, and we were in this far corner. And because this theatre was so big, no light touched this corner. Our two seats and a few seats around it were englufed in PITCH BLACKNESS. There was this moment, about an hour into the movie, where she did something she had never done before, and I did something I had never done before, and this feeling just hovered around us. It wasn't about just doing something new, it was about her trusting me enough to do what we did, it was about me showing her that I was worth trusting. And god....what a great feeling it is to look back on what happened. I have this image of my mind, just this still frame, where I just  knew  that I wanted what we were doing, and that she wanted it too.  Onto another happy subject, Kill Bill Volume 2 comes out on DVD on August 10th. And I'm gonna buy it and me and Nicole are gonna watch it. And she's all like "it's gonna be so dumb" but deep down I think she kinda wants to see it, who knows? It's one of those things that  looks  dumb, but turns out to be one of your favorite things ever.  I will write again tonight, but before I go, I want to summarize my next trip: I leave tomorrow morning at 6:00 am to go to Isle Royale, it's a 12-hour drive up, we're gonna be on the island for 6 days, then a 12-hour drive back. I'll be back in the evening of July 18th. Nicole's pretty upset I'm leaving, which is totally understandable. She's not like mad at me or anything, she's just gonna miss me. She's going on and on about how much she's gonna miss me. What I don't think she's realized yet is...I'm going to miss her even more.

      Ah yes, I do so belive I forgot to tell you I was going to Cedar Point today (well, its tomorrow now, I went yesterday, the 11th). Well, I went to Cedar Point! Steve invited me and I went with his older brother and his girlfriend. It was really cool. Especially after finishing Mean Streak and hearing me say "thumbs up for that one!" and starting a fad for the day of the four of us giving "thumbs up" to everything. The day ended with us on Power Tower, screaming "thumbs up!" down to the crowd waiting in line. When a few people showed us the thumbs up, we screamed "thumbs up! DO IT!" and about half the line returned the thumbs up. After we got off, people were still giving us the thumbs up. I felt very special.  I didn't get to talk to Nicole all day until about an hour and 15 minutes ago, and we just got off the phone. I'm supposed to call her again at 2:00, but it was really cool just callin and hearin her voice and havin that comfortable feeling of being around her again. We're gonna see each other tomorrow, hang out till about 5-ish (dinner time) then I'll eat dinner, practice my violin for an hour and a half or so, then go to violin practice.  Saturday morning from 9 to 12, I have a service project at the scout lodge. We're going to be moving logs and lumber and blah blah blah. Yeah, it's really gonna suck, but oh well. After that, it's one more week until school. AHHHHHHH! This year is gonna be really crazy, but I'm excited.  You see, in other years, I was very social. But this year, I'm really really going to crack down on my academics. Instead of talking to every last person at lunch, I'll get some homework done. Instead of talking to people during class, I'll pay attention and do my work. Last year, I slacked off a bit. Not enough to ruin my GPA, but enough for me to say "hey, I really gotta buck up." So this year I am going to focus on academics more. I mean...I don't wanna go to high school to meet new people. I don't wanna go there to have all these new friends and learn about other people. I'm gonna go to high school to get an education. I got Nicole and Doty, and I really really don't need anyone else but them. It's not like I'm just gonna keep them at the top of my list, I  desperately  do not want to talk to new people at my school. High school isn't going to be social for me, and I'm very proud to say that I'm okay with that.  It looks like I won't be finishing the first draft of  Blades of Sorrow  before school starts, but I really don't have a problem with that. I'll slow down with it. I'll finish it when I finish it, and I'm okay with whenever that is. Another character just died (buh nuh nuhhhh!) and I'm gonna have Nicole read that chapter to see how well it turned out before I continue, just to make sure I wrote it well. Best critic in the world, she seriously is. I love how she's so honest with me. If she thinks something is shit, she will  tell  me its shit. I love that about her. I always told her not to cut me any slack. She never has. And I love her for it.  August 29th will mark exactly 5 months being with Nicole. I'm thinking about this here. First, I've been gone for the past 24 hours with Steve. Already, that's longer than most of the relationships here at my high school. Also, we passed the dreaded ONE-MONTH. Right away, me and Nicole knew this wasn't fake shit. Most of the relationships at our school are fake, and it's annoying, it really is. I think its hilarious, but it gets really annoying. I mean....its not like I'm not excited when me and Nicole celebrate another month, its not as big of a deal any more. And I don't mean that in a bad way. In fact, I mean that in a very good way. 4 months would be a big deal for some people, but it really wasn't for us. We're so comfortable with this, and we're so into it, it's like 4 months is nothing. Now, I've told people how long me and Nicole have been together, and they go "WHOA! That's a long time!" and I just wanna reply with something like, "Yeah, because you're a fucking whore and you can't keep a boyfriend for more than a week." Me and Nicole were down at the creek one day last week, talking about our 5-month, and I said, "You know it's pretty bad when 5 months is nothin for us, and there's couples at our school throwing a party of their 12-hour anniversary."  That is my rant and rave for theeeee day. I'll post tomorrow, and will hopefully start getting back into my daily schedule, which will actually be a lot easier once school rolls around. So, here's Matt, signing out, but I must first name my combined "Copyrighted (wink wink) Matt Bennett quote": Thumbs up, Bingoyo! DO IT! I'm outta here!

      Wow, I think I'm actually like....gettin better, ya know? I've had problems lately with me worrying too much and/or being too serious. But the past few days, I've been doing pretty good. Surprising as it may sound, I'm actually not being an asshole these past few days.  As every day passes, I get more and more relaxed with...well....life. With every day, I get more into the groove of being laid back and relaxed and  comfortable  with how my life is. I really don't know how to explain it, life is just so much less stressful and harmful to me. Harmful, that is my new adjective for life. It's harmful. But it's not like you can deny that. Too much or not enough of anything is harmful. So how do you know when you have too much or not enough of life?  Well, for me, it wasn't enough life. I was just so  slow  and  dull  about everything I did, and today I was down at the creek with Nicole, and I just had this epiphany and it hit me like a million fucking bricks, seriously. I'm excited about life now. I know it's only been a few hours, but I can't get it out of my head.  I just got the new Avril Lavigne CD from Nicole, and uploaded it onto my computer, and I plan on giving it back to her tomorrow. This is the 3rd CD I've listened to in the past few days. And this is  definitly  the best. Lostprophets was good. Maroon 5 was better. The new Avril Lavigne, "Under My Skin", is absolutely awesome. All you people that say "what a fag, why's this dude listenin to some chick?" This "chick" has some awesome lyrics. And this "chick" has some good fucking music. Props to you, Avril.  Along with the CD, Nicole is letting me borrow "A Child Called It" and "The Lost Boy", both by Dave Pelzer. I'm excited about reading them, I really am. After reading "Please Stop Laughing At Me..." by Jodee Blanco while I was in Williamstown, Massachusetts, I'm especially excited about reading books that Nicole lends me, because that ("Please Stop Laughing At Me...") book I read that weekend was awesome.  Well, I'm gonna go upstairs and read for a while, then call Nicole and stuff. Bingo, yo! (My new saying) I'm outta here!

       At    9:13 PM   , Anonymous said… you are bein a real asshole! you know that KI is not poor like that! that's bullshit! and KY never said this was about Nicole! so w/e dude, think what you want, but i know what is true and what's not!   I just read this comment, written about 25 minutes before i started writing this post here, and it is commenting on my July 22 post titled "Halfway there." Now...let's try to figure this out.  I am trying my very best to forget about those two.  I wonder who wrote that comment! God, that's a stumper!  Well all know it was either Kelly....or Kelli....so I'll try to figure out who by evaluating the comment.  1.) First point....none of the sentences begin with a capital letter. It was taught to us many years ago, Kelly and Kelli, that every sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation point.  2.) Why is it that they did not begin sentences with a capital letter (which would be grammatically correct), and yet, they capitalized such words as KY and KI. However, I do appreciate them capitalizing Nicole's name. That was very sweet of them.  3.) "w/e" is not in the English language, I apologize. In fact, no word in the English language contains a backslash "/". For those of you who are not up on the "Internet Lingo"..."w/e" is an abbreviation for the word "whatever", commonly used by slutty little girls in the place of such comments as "I have nothing intelligent to say" or "I do not know how to answer your question" or the ever-entertaining "hehe, I'm a fuckin ditz!"  4.) The fourth sentence in the paragraph begins with the article "and", and this is incorrect. Just as you saw in the previous sentence, when the article "and" is used in lists or in connecting two sentences. However, this was used incorrectly by just smacking it at the front of the sentence. This problem could be fixed by eliminationg the word "and" at the beginning of that sentence, replacing the exclamation mark at the end of the third sentence with a comma, or replacing the exclamation mark with a semi-colon.        I'll finish this post later, I'm going to go talk to Nicole, I'll be back lllllllllater!

      Yes, Nicole got a new phone. Her old one's battery conked out after a few minutes (we found the average to be 18 minutes), but now she has a new phone with a battery that's  super awesome . We've talked 3 times today, all were more than 45 minutes, one of them even twice that length.  One thing I noticed tonight was that I worry so damn  much ! God dammit, I am fucking paranoid about  everything . Whether its small or big, everything freaks me out and I'm always worrying about her and everything. There's a big difference between caring about someone, and annoying them by caring too much.

      Alright, this journal isn't like some weird form of shameless self-promotion, I promise. The reason I'm talking about my books so much is because everything I believe is put into those books. Everything I feel strongly about, you will find in there. I was just thinking about this in the shower this morning, and I wanted to clear it up to you. I'm not promoting myself.  I mean....what would promotion do? I don't  sell  my books. I don't have a publisher or anything. My point is that I talk about a lot of deep stuff in here. Probably 90% of that stuff somehow finds its way into my writing. Get the point here?  Man, I haven't been writing in here that much, I really should start catching up. I've been doing a lot of Morrowind, lot of Warcraft III: Frozen Throne, lot of Nicole, lot of writing. Last night Nicole came over and we were going to rent Fight Club (one of my favorite movies) and A Walk to Remember (one of her favorite movies). So we get to Blockbuster, and  GOD FUCKING DAMMIT , they don't have Fight Club. So we rented A Walk to Remember and Carrie, which we thought was the Sissy Spacack (how you spell dat?) version, instead it was some 2002 made-for-tv movie, and it was really gay. So we watched A Walk to Remember, and SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, it wasn't that bad. I saw a lot of reasons for why she wanted me to see it, but it was cool watching it with her right there. I'll hand it to her, it wasn't bad, wasn't bad at all.  This won't be my last post today, I promise, but I need to go call Nicole and finish letting this Maroon 5 CD download. I  will  be back tonight, I promise! Keep your head up and the sun outta your eyes!
