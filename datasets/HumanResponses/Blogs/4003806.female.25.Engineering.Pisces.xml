      Ok so i've discovered putting the photos onto the blog - watch for more to come. Turns out I haven't got any recent ones on my computer - well atleast recent ones of TN... But the one below is exciting - just check out the engagement rings for both of them! This picture is my personal favorite - just wish it was from a better angle. Tony and Patty look really happy!   On a side note, if you tried to check out the car selling - that won't be up till next Wed. Apparently there is some sort of weekly deadline and the website was not all that informative...   The camaro is coming home today - with working windshield wipers!   Now if I could add sound and you could hear a song from my guitar...&nbsp; ;)

      Check out the adventure story on Iulia's blog!  Turns out I'm not the only one thinking of getting a new car - Rebs was somehow persuaded to get a new car! Had to be a guy ;) somewhere in the reasons... That spontaneity is what's needed and I just don't have it! I went to the dealership, drove a car - couldn't pick a color, saw another car I liked and they stressed me out! One dealership - the man didn't even try to sell me a car - I thought he could have been more pressuring, this time I thought they were overboard. What I'm looking for is a dealer to assure me its the best buy! And I need to pick a stupid car... ah!  What I need is my camaro to morph into something great that I just didn't know I wanted....

       urlLink    Its me and Vinay goofing around before the rafting. We were slightly early and had a lot of time for some goofy behavior - inspired by Iulia. She convinced us all to send postcards to each other - we randomly drew names, wrote the cards and they should come any day... I just need to make it out to check my mail!

      Iulia and Kristi ventured down into the south this past weekend and stayed with me for a few days. We had a tentative plan - and hit most everything on the list - and always with a bit more adventure than you'd expect. We headed out to the Biltmore House on Friday ( urlLink www.biltmore.com ) and then made it back in time for a great indian dinner ala Vinay... There was chicken curry, paratha, paneer with spinach and a daal...I wish Kristi and Iulia came for dinner more often - Vinay is a great cook!  Sat we went rafting - overall it was fun. The Pigeon River is supposed to be a mild river with mostly 3's and a few 4's. Our theory of hot rafting guides and hooking up Iulia didn't quite pan out...  Our guide, Alison, was a little late on a call (or something) and led us into a rock. The rock sent half our boat - Vinay, a poor woman, and Kristi - all overboard in the middle of a rapid. It was terrifying! Exciting after they make it back into the boat - but very scary watching them float towards rocks and not being able to pull them back in. But everyone did make it into the boat and one day the rafting folks will send us a picture and then we can pass it on... It made it easy to understand the instinct to jump in and pull people out - at the same time it was very clearly a really bad idea...  Sunday we road on the Creeper Trail. There is a great program called Rails to Trails - check out  urlLink www.railstotrails.org . They create bike trails out of old railroad paths - so the grade is limited to 5% or less. This trail has a shuttle to the top and is 17 miles down! Mostly without pedaling. The next thing to try is their night rides. Hopefully we won't encounter any animals. This time there were 2 deer. Beautiful deer...  And tomorrow I get back to the tn regular life... Or atleast to work... The calculations are coming, the deadline is fast approaching, but supposedly there is help in sight.  I was working last Thursday - but specifically on what,  I've completely forgotten. Definitely a good weekend!

       urlLink    This is the apartment pool - only now its empty! Its only been open for one week this summer -a very nice pool during that week. Hopefully it will be open again soon. The nice thing about TN is this summer weather lasts into October -started around the middle to end of April... .

      Alright, turns out that while i can post a jpeg - no idea on the bmp files. Vinay sent a cute picture of himself - eventually i'll get him to post it...  Today a man at SIEMENS informed me that you cannot use the word "accuracy" when talking about pressure controls valves. Odd that the catalog on his product claims "outstanding accuracy"... Also was no help at trying to convert a gas flow into liquid. Although I think i'm off on trying to do that. If anyone has any suggestions on SCFM to flow of water - my plan is to calculate it based on maximum flow through an orifice.... When I was looking for help at work, they told me to talk to the people most recently out of school (that is me!). And the same SIEMENS man does not think i should be putting water through the pressure controller - regardless of how i try and explain that its just safety - not really ever to be used that way...  And i'm working on Anna Karenina - I saw oprah's commercial on it and am again excited. I'm up to Levin and Kitty living in the country... Its a good book, but not the fastest read at all... I'm surprised to find that Tolstoy is actually funny sometimes...

       urlLink    Here is a picture from my first hike! Its a little dark, but see if you can notice how wet we are! We did not check the weather channel, and according to another woman we met on the hike it was supposed to rain at 3pm and it did! That was about 45 minutes into our 3 hour hike to Laurel Falls (in Hampton TN)... Not too far from where I live. The hike was exhausting and cold - but a blast!
