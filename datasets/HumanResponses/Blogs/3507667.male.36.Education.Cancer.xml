      And so it begins, my first slice at the Blog phenomenon.  The day is quiet, and the sun is warm, so naturally I find myself indoors at my computer.  So let's start off with a little bit of information about myself.  I'm a single dad, of two very beautiful and comical little girls named Jecynda-Lynn, and Marrissa ages 9 and 6 respectively.  I work full time for SkillSoft as a Mentor to a Global online learning community focusing on IT certifications. I'm considering a change of venue hopefully in the near future so that I can find myself in another part of our great country.  The farther west, the better in my opinion.  I enjoy writing, reading, walking, and spending time with my children and my black lab puppy named appropriately for a black lab, Winter.  This being my first posting and attempt at such a task, I will keep this short and to the point.  So, hopefully those who visit will enjoy themselves, and drop me a line to chat when they get a chance.  RLB.

      Well, today my daughter decided to tell me she has a boyfriend. My first reaction was to get out a shotgun, plenty of shells, and take the dog hunting for little boy.  Then I remembered I don't have a shotgun, and my dog's a big coward. So I scrapped that idea to bake chocolate cupcakes and discuss some birds and the bee's with my 9 year old, Jecynda.  Well the cupcakes turned out very well, and the conversation was much easier than I had first anticipated. We talked about how babies were made and the different anatomies of girls and boys. I told her how much responsibility babies were and gave her an example of how much time, money, and energy it takes. The discussion ranged between different topics, and luckily I was prepared with some good books and articles that included images and diagrams. By this time we passed cupcakes and started making a pie.  :o)  After all of that I was reading up on some articles preparing myself for the inevitable follow up questions, when I came across an article on the popularity of oral sex starting at the age of.....wait for it....9 YEARS OLD. Apparently, there is an epidemic of  urlLink STD's  of the mouth and throat of children averaging ages 12-15, they even have sex games called the Rainbow Kiss (I'm not about to explain this one).  I will wait to discuss this with her in a few years, but it made my stomach turn reading about some of these things. I hope that my daughters have learned enough from me and others in the family to know that this type of behaviour is something they need to hold off of until they are older.  It makes my stomach turn.  As a parent I know that it is certainly very important to talk to my children about sex, to be open and honest and answer their questions truthfully and help them understand. It's my duty to teach them my moral values but to remember what it was that I went through as a kid, and look at the reality of the situation, and be sure to give them some ammunition to deal with these issues. My daughters aren't quite yet in the teens, and let me tell you I am not looking forward to it all.  I hope they forgive me when they bring their first boyfriend home, because it is my intention to make such an example of the little (censored) that no other little boys will come within 50 yards of my daughters.  I've also comtemplated just chaining them in the attic until they are 30, or trying to find an alarmed, trapped, chastity belt made out of titanium alloy equipped with rocket launcher, eletro-shock, and knockout darts.   Oh well...I'm holding out that I'll be a lucky parent who's discussions with their children took hold and actually sunk in, so that I'm not the grandfather wayyy to early.

      Well, I have missed too much time from my blog, I was going through withdrawals.  So much to say.  First, during my trip to Ottawa I dropped off a few resumes, and when I returned home, I had 3 emails from different companies wanting to set up phone interviews with me. The very first phone interview I had, I got the job. The salary is very sweet, 65k/year plus stock options, and bonuses.  I'll wait until I have the other interviews but this is definately sweet.  My only problem is trying to get everything here wrapped up, finding how I will deal with daycare and babysitting, I need to find an apartment or house, etc.  This is a huge deal, and something I really wasn't expecting.  Hopefully it will all work out.  Second, my parents reaction to the whole thing. I've been staying here now for two years, and have been helping to support the household, as well, they have grown to feel like sudo-parents to my daughters.  So needless to say things aren't going over very well at the moment with the whole moving out of province thing.  My mother is furious that I didn't give them more notice, and my father is pissed off that I am taking the girls so far away. Of course, my mom is feeling the same and using the notice as an excuse. Unfortunately, I can't make the kind of money in N.B. that I can outside of the province. Those who have known me, know that I have never been comfortable here in N.B. Although it's a beautiful province and very peaceful and safe, it's just far too mundane and boring for me with very little real opportunity. My parents recognize the fact that I'm not happy here and that I am very independant and that living with them is killing my spirit. I hope they can understand later that moving is the right thing to do.  Perhaps I may wait until next year, but we'll have to see.  Now, on to something a little more comical. This morning I woke up, and headed straight to the bathroom as per my norm.  My daughter Marrissa (5) needed to go and was waiting for me. After I finished and washed my hands I started to walk out of the bathroom when I hear a splashing sound.  Missy had decided to try and pee like her daddy, and it went everywhere, and I mean everywhere. I was laughing so hard that I was trying to tell her to stop between breaths to no avail.  Well, she now understands why girls sit and boys can stand, especially after having to clean it all up.  It's moments like these that make me glad I'm a parent.  I'll keep my situation updated.

      The trip went fantastic; I will have some photos up at some point. The girls met their great grandmother/grandfather and all their aunts, uncles, and cousins that they have yet to meet. Needless to say they were spoiled rotten by it all.  The trip was long though, coming back was very tough. After my arrival in Ottawa it took a heck of allot of willpower to try and leave after 4 days. I so miss that city and the people there.  Well, I also managed to get a few interviews in and passed off quite a few resumes to different companies.  I have 3 phone interviews lined up, and a Job offer to consider. I will weigh all of my options before I decide what I will be doing, but leaving NB is definitely a priority for me.  More later.  RLB

      Well one more work day and then I'm off for 5 days. I'm travelling to Ottawa for my Grandparents 75th wedding anniversary. During my trip up I have scheduled several interviews with companies that I'm interested in working with. I will be taking up several resumes and storming the HR offices of potential employers.  I'm very excited about this because I've been wanting to move back to Ottawa for some time now and this might be a chance for me to at the very least test the employment waters and get an appraisal of my corporate worth.  As well I will be visiting some of my friends that have moved or currently live in Ottawa and surrounding areas. Should be allot of fun and many of them haven't seen the girls since they were babies.  All in all i'm very excited about the trip, and can certainly use the break.  On a crappier note, I was assigned another exam track that I have to study for on top of the exams I currently have to write. This one is Exchange 2003: 70-285 - Designing and Planning an Exchange 2003 Deployment. No reference material out for this yet, so I will have to wing it. Not looking forward to it, haha.  Have a great day all.  RLB

         Well it's official the Calgary flames lost the cup. As much as I was hoping they would somehow pull off a miracle and bring the cup back to Canada, you had to agree that Tampa was the better team. Faster and much more talented, they didn't rely on only one person (Iginla) to create all of their scoring chances.   I really do love Hockey, I think of all the sports it incorporates everything, fighting, speed, excitement, and has the hardest trophy in professional sports to win. I'm a bit disappointed though that the sport is becoming so Americanized and the changes that are reflected to the game are purely so that it is more marketable in the good ole U.S. of A.   So, as a follow up to my Blog yesterday, the drug of choice is Paxil, apparently it won't affect my sex life.&nbsp; Had a good laugh at that, I think the doc thought I was crazy, meanwhile I just kept chuckling every time he said Paxil after that. So we'll see how it goes, I'm always open to new things. In my opinion this is all just another great opportunity to learn something. He also mentioned I needed to lose some weight, almost punched him in the kisser there, but then he said Paxil again, and I chuckled. The good news is I have lost 10 pounds since last week, of course it's mostly water weight, but I'll take the cudo's for it in any respect.   My darling daughter Jecynda received a 94% (A) on her end of the year project on the American Bald Eagle (a species with a hair style I can certainly agree with) and I'm extremely proud of her.&nbsp; She spent a very long time researching, reading, and learning about the ABE and then a considerable amount of time putting it all together using paints, articles, pictures, and a whole heck of allot of writing and reading.    Which brings up another point, school is almost out, another two weeks and the girls will be home 24/7. Yayyyyyyy!! (Extreme Sarcasm!!) Well at least their is Horse Camp that I will be shipping them off to later in July.&nbsp; :o) I so love my daughters, and I can't wait to do allot this summer as far as camping and some traveling but on the downside, peace and quiet will have left the stage for the next two months, haha.

      Well, today is the official anniversary of the day I quit smoking.  It has been 4 years to this day.  Let me tell you it was no easy ride, and I am still suffering from the consequences as a result of my quitting that nasty disgusting habit.  I put on 40 pounds over a period of 8 months. I still have cravings every now and then.  I have become one of the worst anti-smoking advocates. I suffer from insecurites from the weight I put on.  One other thought of note, I'm actually finding it harder to lose the weight than I did quitting smoking.  The main reason is that I work 12 hours sitting in front of a computer, and then come home and sleep. The sedantary lifestyle that I'm forced to live now is very tough to try and alter. After working the shifts I'm so tired that I have very little energy to work out at all, let alone spend the required time I need to with my daughters. I'm trying though.  I've bought a gym (universal) and a Elyptical/Stepper combo that I use.  I joined a gym for the times after work I have enough energy to actually go.  Now having said that, it's only come to my attention recently that I may be suffering from depression as well. I'm having trouble sleeping, I find myself a bit moody, and my appetite is skewed. I spoke with my doctor and he wants to try me out on some new anti-depressants, he believes that this all has to do with my inevitable break up with my ex and is just starting to manifest itself now that things seem to be going my way.  I'm a relatively intelligent guy and I thought I would know if I was feeling depressed.  I'm naturally a comical sort, and thought that because I laugh alot and goof around that I couldn't possibly be depressed, until the doc said that it's possible that it's a reflex action when I'm nervous or anxious. Lord knows I've been anxious the last year or so, but I chalked that up to being tired so much, which I chalked up to working so hard and being a single parent.  So, let's see: 1) self-concious 2) Possibly Depressed 3) Leads a Sedantary life 4) Has a thing for sheep (oops, forget I mentioned that) haha. 4) Doesn't believe a word the doctor is telling me.  Damn I'm one messed up little cookie.  Best do the obvious, Hide in my room until the world goes away!!!  Hmmm..wonder if it's just me...or is it them...me? or Them?  Oh crap, add paranoid to the list now.  RLB   A sense of humor can be a dangerous thing in the wrong hands

      Well this is one of those days that I'm just exhausted. The girls were up at 6am, and I didn't get much sleep the night before. Ran around all day doing laundry and cleaning, then got the bright idea to do some baking, so I made brownies.   The girls must have found some speed pills lying about, because they were going nuts all day, nonstop, until they went to a birthday party for a neighbour that I totally forgot about and had to race down to the mall and pick up presents and a card.    My loving dog, decided she didn't like the fact that I left with out here and chewed up the loveseat, down to the wood.  So she's, excuse the pun, in the dog house. No treats for her today.  The girls are in the bath now, and then shortly to bed, so to give myself a bit of a break, I've decided to vent here on my blog.  All you parents out there no what type of day I'm talking about, we all have them.  Single parents of course are doubley exposed to the strees.  What I need is one of those coin dispensers of Valium and Ativan...ohhh yeah!!  RLB   A Moments Peace should last more than a Moments Peace!

      Well work is almost over and then 4 days off. I think I'm going take the girls to see Shrek 2 tonight. I've heard some good things about it and apparently the cat played by Antonio Banderas is just hilarious.  I'd like to take a second and again thank urlLink Lisa  for the help with my Blog on the  urlLink new site . It needs quite a bit of work and hopefully I can get the comments section up and running.   Oh, the Ninja Chipmunk hasn't shown on the trail again yet so Winter is safe so far. Hope it appears though, I can always use a good laugh.   -RLB

            So I was watching  urlLink CNN  last night for a minute while taking a break from studying and there was a report on global warming and the rise of American's buying urlLink SUV's  as there preferred method of transportation. The reporter interviewed several Americans who seemed to be well educated and well spoken. Each of them when asked why buy an SUV knowing that they are adding to the already growing problem of environmental global warming gave pretty much the same answer: &quot;I'm an American, and this is our lifestyle.&nbsp; urlLink Bigger is better .&quot; This is an actual quote from one of the interviewees and resembled quotes by the others.  Well my jaw dropped. To this point I knew that Americans were for the most part self-absorbed and ignorant of the world around them, but I had not realized to what extent.   I know that Americans are very urlLink proud  and patriotic folks. They believe in  urlLink freedom , they believe in urlLink justice , and they have an overwhelming belief that they are urlLink superior  to all other urlLink countries . They have decided that they should destroy the planet because, &quot;Bigger is Better&quot;, well who's going to stop them. Obviously they don't have the ability to urlLink  police  themselves let alone other countries, yet, there they are doing so in spades. They have the highest urlLink murder rate  per capita then any other country, they have the highest rate of urlLink domestic violence  than any other country, they have the urlLink highest incarceration rate  of any other country (the majority of those incarcerated being of non-Caucasian background).&nbsp; The list goes on and on and on.  Another thing that boggles the mind, think of how many shows there are like urlLink Jerry Springer  on television, now consider that they do a show a day for a season of approx 8 months, and have an average of 6 guests per show. Do the math. That is a significant representation of the population of the USA. Pretty scary when you consider the manner of these folks on these shows.  I have a very great respect for urlLink Michael Moore , because I think he has the ability to look outside the box and view the problems that America is facing right now and that the focus of the urlLink current government  is skewed from where it should be targeted. Others like urlLink  Bill Maher  are trying there best to try and reveal the hypocrisy that is the USA's foreign policy and political state. Then at the very other end of the spectrum you get complete idiots like  urlLink Rush Limbaugh  spouting off his urlLink sexist , prejudicial views to a welcoming below normal IQ listening audience doing his best to keep the norm.  Let's hope that the Americans, who are the core are good people that have  just lost themselves, wake up and realize they live on a planet with others and those others are getting a little tired of the bully on the block. urlLink We all know what happens to bullies, history is full of them, and they've all fallen........hard!!

      Well election time is looming closer and closer and I am in terrible straits as to whom I will be voting for. This is the first time of any election in my voting past that I am sorely tempted to spoil my ballot and not to choose any of the current candidates.  Here is a breakdown of the parties and my problems with  them:     Well for a political party that has made so many promises to bring down the deficit and help the poor, they are doing a pretty lame job of it.&nbsp; What with the  urlLink Sponsorship Scandal  and the urlLink Gun Registry  muck up, they don't give me the impression they are fiscally responsible at all. As a matter of fact it seems just down right poor money management and I dare say criminal in scope. Since the reign of the Liberal part, wages have remained relatively fixed but taxes, service costs such as electricity have risen by 300%, insurance has risen as much as 600%, Gas has risen to unprecedented levels, the cost of living has sky rocketed, and in general the middle class has been supporting these rises. We have more poverty and child poverty in Canada then any other time in our History and we have lost our coveted status of being the #1 Country in the world to live, we are currently 7th now.  urlLink Paul Martin  was the number two man and finance minister and he carries allot of the responsibilities for the deep cuts to transfer payments and the devastating cuts to health care and social services.    Two words to explain why this party will not receive my  vote:  urlLink Stephen Harper . Stephen Harper is now the leader of the federal Conservative party. Harper was a founding member of the Reform party, the predecessor of the Canadian Alliance, and went on to become leader of the Alliance. He was a key policy maker in the earlier years of the Reform party, but left the party after a rift with leader Preston Manning. He is as radical as they come with his policies and I have no doubt that he will put us further in debt with his agenda. Then of course there was the fact that he made the comment about Atlantic Canada residents as having a  urlLink &quot;Can't Do Attitude -&nbsp; that's the product of too many years of federal transfer payments and industry handouts&quot; .&nbsp; He also made the comment that we as Canadians have a &quot;defeatist&quot; attitude. So it's my contention that this man will never get my vote, I am a very proud Canadian and I certainly have anything but a defeatist attitude.      I think the  urlLink NDP  have some great ideas and I like their platform, however, if you visit their site or listen to their speeches they do not have any ideas on paying down the deficit or balancing the budget. I believe the reason for this is simply that they can't do it as it stands and offer all of their great ideas. Their just isn't any money in the books for them. If they could come up with some good in-depth answers to these questions. I would strongly consider supporting them, even though they don't stand a chance in hell of actually being elected, they may take away the Majority Government that the Liberals have been rewarded with over the past 20 or so years.     So there we have it, these are some of the more important reasons for my current state of, "Who the heck do I vote for?" mentality.  "Politicians resemble dogs, and I'm sure they'd lick themselves if they could."  -anonymous  RLB

       8 months ago, I bought a Black Lab puppy, and the girls named her Winter. I know, Black Lab and the first name that pops into their strange little minds is the season of white. This puppy is the most gentle, timid, and playful dog I've ever had the pleasure of owning. She has rapidly become a welcomed part of our family.  Now being the good owner that I am I enjoy taking my puppy out for walks on the nature trail, I let her go and she tears around the woods and sometimes even jumps into the river for a swim. She listens well for a hyper-active dog and very gentle when strangers approach to pet her or introduce there own dogs to her.      Soooo. Yesterday night after getting home from work and very tired I took  Winter out for our walk. We were halfway down the trail when a little chipmunk darted onto the trail. Being the brave doggy that she is, she tore off after it into the woods. Thinking poor chipmunk probably scared half to death I started to call the dog back, when I hear something running like hell through the woods towards me. Winter comes bursting out of the woods with this tiny chipmunk close on her heels. She looked at me as she streaked past with pleading eyes as if to say, &quot;Oh crap, it's the bionic chipmunk&quot;, and then she was off again. It took a good 5 minutes before she came back onto the trail, out of breath and full of branches and leaves. I know that she's upset with me now because I laughed at her for a goodly period of time before being able to continue our little walk. I can't wait to take her back out later tonight to see if that possessed chipmunk is waiting for her.

Thanks for introducing me into the world o'blog Lisa.  While I'm at it, I wanted to endorse a couple of websites:  For those of you that like computer gaming there is no funnier comic than  urlLink Ctrl-Alt-Del , I strongly recommend reading the first in his archive to the last. Tim Buckley is a very talented artist and his humor is infectious. I used his site and some of his art for my homepage at  urlLink www.geocities.com/spiritmonger2004 .  Another Web Comic that tends to crack me up and is part of my daily routine  is  urlLink Dog Complex , for those of you who  enjoy comics.  Well that's it for today.&nbsp; For those of you who drop in to read up on my  adventures, please feel free to drop me a note and say hi. I enjoy meeting new people.

      I'm going to take up this Blog with some personal observations on being a single father to two little girls.  I want to rant today because of a comment that was made to me while I was out, and needed to get it off my chest.  :o)  Firstly, I was surprised at the amount of prejudice that surrounds the fact that I have custody of the girls. Many people that I've talked to openly believe that children should be cared for by the Mother and not the Father. When asked why, the usual reply is, that Mothers offer more affection and patience. The fathers are generally and typically placed back in the role of the food gatherer/hunter. Work to support the family but doesn't add any emotional support.  I think this generalization is far off the mark in today’s society. Men are far more in touch with themselves, and women have taken a far more prominent role in the work place, and there are many more single parent families where the men have taken custody of the children.  Although men tend to be less emotional and more logical in the way they approach problem solving, this doesn't necessitate the fact that they can't show love and support to their children.  Dating is another problem. You would think that at the very least being a single parent should earn a modicum of respect for taking up the role and responsibility of caring for the children. It has been my misfortune to have met some pretty shallow individuals who don’t want a man with children.  Generally, they have their own and aren’t looking for more.  This leads back to the fact that more women have custody of their children, due to this most of the single woman I have met have children, and do not want more children. So, this limits the field dramatically for someone like me. Those that are open to the fact of embracing children into their lives sometimes become resentful of the fact that the children generally are the priority in my life. A jealousy builds and soon the relationship ends.  I’m not interested in dating much anymore, now I’m looking for some companionship and the start of a modest social life.  One in which I can be comfortable with friends and enjoy a good conversation and laughter.  Dating is the most dehumanizing, embarrassing, humiliating experience I’ve had the misfortune of having.  I now prefer the online dating scene, where I can first screen those that interest me, and choose to speak only to those I believe are mature, good natured, caring, and intelligent.  Although, I don’t intend to date much at this time, I do wish to meet some new friends and this is the best way in my opinion.  Well, that’s my rant for today as far as being a single parent and the experiences I’ve had so far.  Tomorrow, I will be more positive with my post.  I wanted to rant today because of a comment that was made to me while I was out, and needed to get it off my chest.  :o)  Remember, Life starts the moment you start to enjoy it.

      So, after a 14 hour shift I'm ready to go home, tired, eyes hurting from staring at a monitor forever, and not in a very good mood. I get into my nice comfy 2002 Ford Taurus and begin to pull out of the parking lot when there's a loud bang, a grinding sound, and an acrid odour coming from the front of the car. I pull over to the side and get out, and sure enough the car body is resting on the left front tire.  Having spent my last 10 dollars on my lunch that night I had none for towing luckily for me they billed Wood Motors where I had the car towed. I had to ask one of my fellow co-workers to give me a drive home, she lives on the Royal Road, and I in Oromocto, so extremely out of her way, but being the great gal she is she drove me home.  After a few hours I called Wood Motors to get the low down on the car, and was told that the strut spring had broken and had destroyed the break line, a monitoring line, and the tie rod. The parts will cost 200 and the labor another 200, but luckily for me, apparently, there is a recall on both of the springs.  Now here is the kicker...I have not received my letter stating the recall, so I have to pay for the repairs up front, as well, they aren't going to use original Ford Parts, they are going to use after market parts, and the repairs will take up to 4 days.  So, needless to say i'm pretty pissed off over the whole thing, I have to borrow my fathers car, and the hassle of having to try and come up with the repair money for parts that have been recalled is wearing my patience very thin. I have called the head office, and will be going down to Wood Motors tommorrow to try and get some satisfaction.  At the very least they should cover the damage 100%, I should be given a rental, and some type of reimbursement for the hassle this has caused me.  Ohhhhhh....they say things come in three's...so two more to go!  :o)   RLB

      I had a discussion today with some lady friends of mine about the changing definition of what a man is. Where we fit into todays society as opposed to say 50 years ago. This inevitably led into the discussion of where a woman fits into today's society.  Throughout the discussion I was struck by a profound negative image of what a man is and what a man does.  Gender stereotyping is not what I'm trying to discuss here in today's blog, but how there is a polarization of how a man needs to act in today's society. Male sterotyping has begun to impose both negative and positive change in today's male, as well as resentment and confusion.  Are males supposed to hold the door open, is that chivalry, is it polite, or is it a slap in the face to today's progressive women who may think they are being patronized. Are males still protectors, if a thief breaks into a house do we ask first if the wife feels she should have the option of confronting the criminal, or is it the man's responsibility. Do men have to show emotion the same way a female does, are we required to know how to communicate and listen and to that end understand the opposite sex. What is confusing is what is expected of us today. We must be strong, yet vulnerable. We must be chivalrous yet aware not to offend. We must be emotional, yet rock steady. We must be allowed to cry, yet not show weakness in times of stress. We must be romantic yet masculine. We must be in touch with ourselves, yet not show our feminine side lest we be labled.  Well, I quickly became confused and a bit frustrated. I consider myself to be a modern man. I have read several books on woman/men and how to communicate. Yet, according to the ladies wishlist, I can't think of a single man that would fit their long list of requirements.  And, the second I stated my wish list for a woman, I was labled a chauvinist. I chuckled at the time, but the more I thought about it, the more I started thinking these ladies were dillusional.   To me it boils down to understanding and communication on both sides. Woman as well as men need to be able to understand each other. Men do need to come out of the caveman days, but woman need to understand that we are not woman and that we have different ways of thinking and dealing with matters.  Ok...glad I got that off my chest.  Chauvinist signing out now.   RLB

      Well I finally watched Fahrenheit 9/11 last night. I think it was over-hyped but it was an excellent documentary. I think the part that caught my attention more than anything was the contracts that  urlLink  Halliburton  were awarded for oil production, pipelines and such. It's unbelieveable the amount of money they will make off of this.  I'm not going to go on too much about the movie other than I highly recommend it to people, so that they can start to ask the questions that need to be asked. I am not a big fan of the U.S. but Mr. Moore is someone I respect, even though he's extremely biased in his opinions he backs them up and starts the debate.   I have also recently read the  urlLink  Al Franken  Al Frankin book,  urlLink  Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them . This is one of the funnier books I have read in a long time and I highly recommend it. If you liked that one you'll really like,  urlLink  Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot  another very funny book.  Well I have been procrastinating in my work out schedule for the last few weeks, and I really need to get back into it. Oh, do I need some will power. I've stopped drinking coffee, ordering out for food, and I now make lunches for work. Let's hope I can get off my bum to start working out more, hehe.  The girls are having a great summer, they've had freinds over almost every day, or have been out at friends houses. They are in the pool whether it rains or pours and have loved it. So it makes me happy.  WHERE IS THE SUN!!!! The rain and overcast skies are just depressing.  RLB

      I have to admit it, I'm a computer geek. I guess in my trade as an IT Teacher I almost have to be, but I go far beyond the realms of normal geekdom into the geek atmosphere.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't look geeky or really act all that geeky (in public), but I definitely am a geek.  What brought this on? I  urlLink read  today that  urlLink DELL  the worlds largest OEM of computer/accessories has begun to sell Desktops with  urlLink LinSpire  (a Linux distribution) to the mass market in Europe.   So what? Well, for those of us that have had virus scares, hacker nightmares, bugs, crashes, blue screens of death, software not working, slow unresponsivecomputing, and the inability to use open source software it's a huge deal. It means that finally Linux is starting to gain more acceptance in the main stream. Currently they hold a 25% marketshare in the Server OS, however, only geeks like myself and the brave and adventurous choose to run a Linux distribution duel or single booted on their home systems. (ie:  urlLink Mandrake ,  urlLink Suse ,  urlLink RedHat ) If you haven't tried Linux, then it's definitely worth the effort to give it a try. It's much more customizable and secure, not to mention the open source software and applications available are much better than anything Microsoft could offer. Now with LinSpire the ease of installation has come full circle, and it's painless. Installing software on LinSpire is easier than even Windows with their patented CNR technology. You can even run the entire OS off of a single CD-Rom by downloading and burning the Live CD from urlLink  here .  I'm one very excited cookie. It's about time that Microsoft had some serious  competition, and it's now only a matter of time before other large OEM manufacturers start selling Linux boxes outright without fear of the repercussions from Microsoft.  Viva la Linux Revolution  RLB

      I was recently sitting at my computer, bored stiff, trying to think of something to do.  I was listening to an internet radio station when a song came on that quite literally dragged me back into the past.  You know how sometimes when you're sad there is a song that you listen to, one that you can feel in your bones and it feels like the words were meant just for you.  Well that song played on the station for me.  The song is called Solitude, and I can remember listening to it when I was going through my split with the ex. I thought it would be fun write the lyrics here, because the song affected me quite a bit, so here it is.  Solitude - Black Sabbath - Master of Reality  My name it means nothing My fortune less My future is shrouded in the dark wilderness Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on Everything I possessed - now they are gone  O where can I go to and what can I do? Nothing can please me onlyy thoughts are of you You just laughed when I begged you to stay I've not stopped crying since you went away  The world is a lonely place - you're on your own Guess I will go home - sit down and moan Crying and thinking is all that I do Memories I have remind me of you  And I'll leave it at that for today.   Sometimes the hardest of memories come back at the best of times and create memories of their own.

      I had to make a decision today. It was a very tough decision and it's something that I'm probably going to regret.  Let me first say that I got the job I wanted in Ottawa. They were extremely impressed with me and my experience and they were very eager for me to begin with the company. The catch was they needed me to start tommorrow, or Monday the 12th/2004.  Now, I could probably have swung this, I have friends in Ottawa and family there as well, so getting set up this quickly would have been difficult but possible.  However, the problem arises that my daughters are tremedously upset by the move. I handled the situation wrong by not giving them time to adjust to the change. Having had their mother leave them and not communicate too much with them has polarized them with the belief that if we move, they will no longer have contact with their aunt, grandparents, cousins, and 2nd cousins. Even though I did my best to try and explain things, it was all happening far to fast for them to adjust to.  So here is the decision. Do I take a job in a place that I have been wanting to move back to for several years now with a pay increase of 20+k per year and have the ability to socialize with friends that I dearly miss or do I spend another year in N.B. and prepare my children for the move, thus giving up this opportunity in hopes for another when the time comes. On the plus side of this, I can save alot more money that what I have and make the transition easier.  I chose to stay.  I'm terribly saddened by it all but I have to think of the girls first, and of their needs. As selfish as I would like to be and say, "they'll get used to it", I don't think this would be true. They have suffered quite a bit of loss and pain in their little lives, and I'd as soon spare them any further hardship if I can.  One more year.  (sigh)  RLB

      It's the time of year when we can all dress up in red and white, wave our flags, forget the worries of the country, and with one strong voice, yell:  Happy Canada Day!!!!.  I'm a very proud Canadian, and have been lucky enough to have travelled the world over. I've been to many other countries, and I've always been glad to be back home in Canada. Every province and territory is unique. The people are caring, unselfish, passionate, diverse, friendly, and above all maintaining the ability to laugh and smile at ourselves and others. We welcome all to our country, we leave our doors unlocked and without fear, we wander, we wonder, and we explore. Our culture is a combination of all other cultures and diverse ethnic backgrounds. I am proud to be a Canadian and I am proud of the Country we all live in.  Even though the elections are over and their was a great amount of disappointment in the way our government is running, we are still largely considered the best country in the world to live. (I voted for the Green Party). I hope that our politicians have learned that we are watching them, and if they screw up again, we'll take action. We are a forgiving people, but hopefully we are not all that gullable that we believe what they are trying to feed us.  A minority government is a good start, and a strong statement.  I hope you all have a great year, and good lives.  RLB   Freedom is precious...just ask those that do not have it

      So after a hard days work, I decide to hit the sack a little early last night. I'm fast asleep when I hear a scream, some heavy crashing sounds, then a door slam, and laughter.  So, being inquisitive, and now fully wide awake and freaked out, I decided to investigate. Apparently, my daughter Jecynda "look daddy a birdy" Bartholomew, was lying down and saw a bird hanging in the corner of my mom's room. She pointed this out to my mom and that's when all hell broke loose. The, terrified bat, freaked out and started to fly around the room. The girls lost it and ran like hell out of the room closiing the door leaving my mom in the closed room with a flying bat. So naturally she grabs a broom that was handily in there and started whacking crazily. *note: The girls were watching tv in there until bed time.  So..here cometh the groggy, freaked-out, savior, Robert. Not knowing any better I opened the door to be confronted with a quite dishevelled mother and a a very pissed off bat. My mom took that opportunity to make her escape nearly bowling me over in her haste.  So I grabbed the broom, and closed the door, and waited for the bat to settle down and land again. I then tried to herd it out the open window, but it was having none of that. Finally, I got a bit peeved and used the broom as a baseball bat and sent the bat flying out the window with a single mighty swing.  Unfortunately, I found out this morning that I ended up hitting it too hard and killed it. So now I'm feeling a tremendous amount of guilt and a bit like a wimp for not just grabbing a towel and getting it that way.  Suffice as to say, everyone finally got to bed, except for me, I was now fully wide awake. So now I'm at work, tired, guilt ridden, and self indited as a bat murderer.  Ahhhhh...what a day!    :o)  The moral of this story...Don't panic, it's just a flying mouse.  RLB

      August 4th, 10:01am I'm standing impatiently in front of the EB World in the Regent Mall, my grubbly little hands wringing each other, the drool coursing down my chin to puddle around my tapping feet. The evil sales clerk eyeing his watch and finally deciding that he has tortured me enough opens the door...the world goes into slow motion...the clerk realizes he's on the floor with open faced sandle prints running up along his back and head...ok, back to reality, I casually strolled in...err...sorry reality, I not so casually speed wobbled into the store and passed the clerk my pre-order receipt and he passed me my copy of Doom III. The box vibrated powerfully in....damn it..ok, reality, I put it in my backpack and waited for my 12 hour work shift to end, of course it took an eternity. I'm pretty sure in my race to get home, I ran over a family of midgets, a crow, and possibly a motorcyler, but hell, who pays attention to little things like that when you have Doom III burning a hole in your backpack.  So after I get home and greeting my wonderfully talkative children who had the misfortune of wanting to give me hugs and kisses when I got home. Both standing arms outstretched clearly in the path between myself and my computer, the tragic accident will be reported in a seperate blog entitled, "Why my girls have sandleprints on their foreheads.". I thought I felt two little bumps in my race to my computer, but again, urgency nullified any type of attention to these matters.  I quickly installed the game, turned off all lights, set up my surround sound speakers, and adjusted my monitor screen. I then donned my extra padded Depends undergarments, hooked up my coffee IV straight into my jugular, order a series of "works" pizzas with instructions to slide them under the doorway and collect the money from the two girls lying on the floor with sandal marks on their foreheads and a terrified somewhat suprised look on their faces.  And the game began.....  *Tune in tommorrow for the continuing report of how Doom III made me fill my Depends Undergarments within the first 15 minutes of play.*  RLB  P.s. I reallllllllly need to get a life.

      Well, I've been neglecting my blog for the last couple of weeks, mainly because it's summer and I've had other things to occupy my time. I will be updating more often over the next few weeks.  Well Friday I went to write my 70-285 exam, having had worked the 12 hour shift the night before, i was pretty wiped. And just my luck halfway through the exam the computer crashed and messed up the exam. Soooo, now I have to reschedule and write it again. Not good.  I went on a date last week, I don't usually talk about my dating and such, but this was alot of fun. I met her through LavaLife and she lives in Maine. She drove up on a whim and we met in Fredericton for a coffee, which led to a dinner, which led to pool at Dooley's, which led to her staying the night, and going out again the next day. I showed her around our capital city and it was alot of fun. She will be coming up again next week, I must say I'm looking forward to it.   Winter is enjoying the summer quite a bit, she's loving the water and the walks on the trails, plus I've been taking her other places to walk to give her some different perspectives. She's starting to mellow a bit more now, not much, but a bit. I've been told it takes roughly two years for Labs to mellow enough that you don't have to worry about them taking off every few minutes.  The girls are doing great, they have had a fantastic summer so far and have done quite a bit. Unfortunately, i won't be able to follow through with the horse camp this year, I just don't have the funds available.  Well, DOOM III is released tommorrow, and I can't wait. Apparently, according to the news, it is the most pirated software in the history of computer gaming, the software hasn't even been released and already over the weekend there has been over 2.5 million downloaded copies over the net. Although, I'm not anti-piracy by any stretch of the imagination, it's worth it to me to purchase it for the box alone. I strongly believe that the cost of games is far too high and the method of distribution and copywrite laws need to be changes, but that's another blog for another day. Suffice as to say, I'm stoked about the release.  Power to the Gamers!!!  RLB
