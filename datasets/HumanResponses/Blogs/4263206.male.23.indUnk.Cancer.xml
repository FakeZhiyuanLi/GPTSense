                    Well it is funny how people can change the way that they act toward you when they are around other people....you think that everything is okay between you and then you see that it is not. Some people are just insecure and don't know how to act, some people need to learn that if they are gonna say something that they need to think it through before it is said. People have been known to say that they don't want anything to do with me.....but why is it you are saying that now after about a month ago you were at my house DRUNK AS FUCK and all up on a brotha sayin shit like "you miss me huh?" but when you are told that you are not missed you say "You're lying." when in reality I could give a fuck less you just pop what I like to call the "fuck up" without calling and asking if it was okay to come over. That shit is disrespectful and uncalled for. You should stick to what you say...if you don't want anything to do with a person don't ever call their home or try to come over and see them, don't spread rumors you know are not true and do not ever threaten someone if you cannot back it up.........the person this is about knows who they are and they need to get their shit straight and grow the fuck up and stop being immatureand childish take responability for your actions and your words don't be two faced and hippocritical. that is all I have to say about that.There are girls on this earth that believe that it revolves around them and noone else matters.......I had this conversation with someone last week about the percentages that women fall under;  85% of women are gold-diggers they care about the possesions that a man has and how much money is in the bank and not about what a man has inside such as love,generosity,compassion,respect. These are the women that feel that a man should pay for everything thay want to do and everything that they want....thes ones don't understand that by being like this they are being prostitutes.  10% of women are looking for "quality not quanity" these are the girls that want a nice guy but insist that they can never find one....these girls are kidding themselves they know a nice guy they just don't wanna deal with what their friends are gonna say or what their parents are gonna say they are to insecure to show how they really feel they hide behind the guise that they can't find someone that will like them for who they are. These girls are the ones that worry me the most.  5% which make up the girls that just don't fucking get it about how shit really is these girls don't know what the fuck it is that they want in a guy or in life for that matter. They sit around and all they wanna do is go out and get drunk and say shit like "oh I wnat a boyfriend but I don't," "I need to be single but I want someone in my life." These girls need to get their shit together and find out what they really want and not lead people on and then turn around and say oh lets be friends and then tell everyone that they made a mistake and that they want to be with that person. I am really angry at women this weekend they think that these little games they play are cute but I don't think so "THAT SHIT IS NOT CUTE" as a friend of mine would say.....get your heads right and be real with yourselves if you like someone tell them and see what could happen. Be open to new things and new people...ladies if a guy is showing interest give him a chance its the best way to see what is in the world for you.I AM OUT THIS BITCH HOLLA BACK!!!!

             Hey everyone how are you all doing? I am okay I got off work early today and went home and relaxed I hope that I can sleep well tonight.WHY ARE GIRLS SOOOOO STUPID..............when you tell them one thing like hey I am busy right now I will call you later they get like who are you with what are you doing, but they forget they are not your girlfriend so its not their business. There are girls out there that I know and I talk to that i usually hang out with on certain days with the whole gang.....one of them tripped on me last week when she asked me on Monday night.. "Are we going bowling tonight?" I said "No I am gonna stay home." she was like "Why who are you with? Whats her name?" I said "Look you are not my girlfriend you had your chance you passed it up and now you are jealous of someone who isn't even at my house......" WTF is up with that? I wish that if a girl was interested in me that they would tell me and not keep it a secret for so long that they get it stuck in their head that nothing could ever work between us.Look....if I like a girl she will know and the actions that she puts forward better be that of her true intentions if she doesn't like me then she should never put her hands on me in a sexual way AT ALL!!!!! that is on everything don't touch me like that unles you wanna do something, don't be a FUCKING TEASE noone likes that no matter what you think.Look ladies be true in what you do and always portray what is true on the outside not just in your mind.

      50 things we wish girls knew….   1. We aren’t mind readers! 2. We are not to be used as pawns in trying to make your girlfriends jealous. 3. When you sleep over never boss me around in bed unless it is during sex. 4. Smoking is the biggest turn off. 5. It never hurts to work out. 6. If you don’t want to hear the truth, don’t ask the question. 7. “Fine” or “whatever” is not an appropriate ending to a conversation. 8. If you want sex, just ask. (In case you didn’t already know.) 9. Don’t expect guys to say as many sweet things as they do in the movies. (It takes a lot of guys and their wives to come up with those scripts). 10. Only models are able to wear most of the stuff you see in fashion magazines. 11. No guy will complain if he comes home and sees you in one of the following outfits: French Maid, School girl, bunny, or just plain naked. 12. You don’t need lingerie to look sexy before bed, short cotton shorts and a tank top are fine by us. 13. Girls look good naked so stop worrying. 14. Sharing your deepest feelings in no way guarantees reciprocity. 15. We are all kinky and willing to try anything that you may enjoy, just let us know. 16. Every so often no matter whether it is true or not remind us that we have the biggest penis you’ve ever dealt with. 17. If were not getting love we’ll start looking…(haha…just kidding…psych…I’m dead serious) 18. The greatest thing ever is to watch a girl touch herself. 19. Most of the time when I fantasize it is about another person. 20. If you, the girl, make out with another girl we won’t consider it cheating. Actually we strongly promote this behavior. 21. Your hair is like 14 inches long, how are we supposed to notice a quarter inch missing. 22. You shouldn’t be flattered or grossed out if we get an erection when dancing with you. All we need is Friction. 23. Porn…hmmm…Porn. Watching porn is like breathing it would just be wrong to ask us to stop. 24. We masturbate, usually more when we are in a relationship, can’t explain it but it is just fact. 25. Blue balls are not sporting equipment. Didn’t your parents teach you not to quit. 26. Giving head is never a bad idea. 27. We are conservationists at heart, water is our biggest love, so shower with us. 28. There are three acceptable ways to wake up: (1) You on top of us. (2) Getting head. (3) Some sort of breakfast. 29. We don’t mind going to gay movies with you but don’t tell our friends. 30. You can’t hold it against us if we cry after sports movies or “Old yeller.” 31. “The game is on” is an acceptable excuse to avoid any serious conversation. 32. Any harsh contact with the testicles should be assumed a serious injury but soft caresses are strongly encouraged. 33. You’re probably not as funny as you think. 34. Brad Pitt is probably a cool guy but if I hear one more girl say “he’s so hot” he may have to die. 35. Your period should be referred to as Blowjob week. (Influenced by a Maxim article) 36. Cooking makes a girl that much more attractive especially if she can use a grill. 37. You can’t get mad if we refuse to hook up your “ugly friend” with one of our friends. 38. For every fart that slips out when you are around we successfully hold in about 15, enduring excruciating pain to do this. 39. If we want to take naked pictures of you it is because we are proud and want to show you off to our friends. 40. The red light means the video camera is off. 41. A guy should be considered sensitive if he asks whether you want to do it with the lights on or off. 42. Whip cream and chocolate syrup are not just condiments for ice cream also Altoids just don’t make your breath fresher. 43. Nothing you will ever do will entitle you to operate the remote control. (Unless operating means handing it to us.) 44. The only thing left to be said after sex is “goodnight.” 45. Video games have helped us develop such finger skills that should only encourage us to play more often. 46. Critiquing our driving is only second to critiquing our love making. 47. Guys nights out are sacred events. If we answer questions we could be castrated. 48. If you ask us to go shopping you have to at least entertain the idea of having sex in a changing room. 49. The jeans don’t make your ass look fat. Your fat ass makes your ass look fat. 50. 99.5% of the time we didn’t mean to hurt you.  I may have offended some people but I am sorry.

      Look alot of you ladies wonder why we do certain things and why we are either mean/rude/or in-sensitive...bottom line is we are guys and we can do wht we want when we want you ladies have shown us that in your own actions...Some ask why we are so complicated, but what you need to understand is that we are who we are for the most part some guys are dispicable and need to be beaten, we always wanty the truth no matter what it helps to be completely honest when dealing with us if you have an opinion state it and leave it at that and don't get mad when we don't respond to it with a "yes dear!" or a "yes I am listening to you." You need to understand that under no circumstance is it okay to be rude to our friends; (we are not mean to yours in front of you out of respect for you.)Some of you wonder why we like you in the first place well its simple either you are extremely hot or we like to be around you and spend time with you on a regular basis. You wonder why we never say anything about us liking you but in reality girls are the most guilty of this.....time after time girls have always told friends and friends of friends and friends of the guy that they like that they think he is cute but they never tell the guy that is where you lode alot of respect from guys and from others at the same time. If you can take the time and sit back and look at everything and assess the situation and your actions and what it is you want to say to whomever then maybe you will understand what we do and why we do it......you need to remember that you (girls) are more complicated than us (guys) you have more little things about you that bother us and we want to know why it is ou insist on doing them. I hope this sheds some light on the subject for certain people who have been wondering about this.
