Hmmm.. then after midzi send my "kakak" home..den he did the same thing to me too..hmm..durin the journey..i have been thinkin much of my own personal prob whereby serius speakin.. i happen to have crush on this girl (until now..alredi at least three mths..} .. anw i knoe this gal ard more than six mths..N wad realli worries me much is dat our communication nowadays is not really at the good terms unlike the last time ard  ..

      Hmm..its alredi 1 am ...to be exact..1.30 by the time i started to write another blog..Friday was certainly meant to be free time since i onli have two to three hour practical onli.. Den met syahidah to discuss the IAW thingy again..serius speakin felt guilty..cos on the thurs meeting..she's the one hu spoke a lot compared to me hu have a quiet outing there..N guess wad? she told me that the way she talk happened to hurt one of the comm members.. I dun realli realise dat but since i'm very quiet at dat time i failed to interfere in that matter.. If i were to interfere dat.. maybe the problem may not occur..anw..syahidah's the latest to discover one of my natural characteristics..being too quiet.. Anw thanx for assisting me very much so far in IAW committee.. Insya allah u will be the in the next coming mss exco..Gee..  Hmm very funny dat i wear baju kurung on the friday but didn go to friday prayers..Why? coz need to report at pizza hut at 2pm..for job training.. Juz have a taste of wearing the new kit..n meet my old members..the world is damn small.. Anw all thankz to saddiq, my sidekick, for helpin me get the job.. even he taught me evrything during the training..   then went back to sch for mcc rehearsal.. Another funny thing happened.. i didnt realise dat but midzi later on remind me dat nite.. let me begin.. I happened to meet riyan juz near the canteen one stairs.. den midzi shout my name..of coz i dun realli aware of dat.. den midzi told me that he pressed his car horn few times dat most ppl in the canteen one looked at wad he's doin but obviously again i didn hear at all.. Poor midzi.. again i'm the one hu caused another person to be at fault.. first..syahidah..den midzi..haha.. so funny n guilty if i were to recall these situations n the blurness of me.. but anw so sorry..to hu have been victimised by my weakness..

      here go the next blog again.. Hmmm u guys may wondering wen is my next blog? hmm..seems that my stress has been building up from time to time.. i hav to admit dat i get easily stressed up..mixed up wen handling too much things.. wen i stressed too much .. i can easily forgot on few things...seriusly gave up doin my CEL practical report as my fren told me the answers were all wrong..no linkage to the question.. but seriusly i cant really understand wad the teacher has been teaching. which shud i blame? my hectic stressful schedule? too much stress? obviously I can't blame wad i'm created on this earth...I realised i'm a slow person as i find it slow to grasp some things... i knoe ppl may not understand wad i'm facin in my life.. If i were to tell them..would they afford to hear n believe? Obviously NOPE!! Even now i feel like an all time loser in life....Why? I've been letting ppl down most of the time..no doubt being such a failure at most occasions in front of ppl..seems like wen ppl had alredi enough of this thing..surely they will tink negative of me.. Oh..shud i blame the fate? Obviously not.. coz God has the right to test us so dat we will be patient wen we r hit by these tests.. but lookin back again..seems like i alredi have enuff.. enuff of holding the "scapegoat" tag in life.. Oh God..Please give me strength to venture the obstacles in life on this small earth..I'm juz onli Your servant who is weak.. Hmm..anw gotta rest now..i juz realli hope that i have peace in mind.. gtg...cya ard..

Special thanks to my IAW comm members for the efforts put into this thing..really nice workin wif u ppl..certainly we have overcome obstacles here n there..u ppl are great..n not to forget ..those manpower hu help to make this event a success..anw now is time to give more focus on studies as common test is gettin nearer n nearer..  gtg now..damn tired..update next time..kk..
