      I had an opportunity to reflect on the direction of my life and my choice of careers.  For the past 4 years I had decided to go into Computer Graphic Design and so had been taking the courses necessary for that industry.  So as I was contemplating I realized that I had one key issue with the majority of the jobs that I had accepted to do.  The ones that required me to be onsite and under the direction of some sort of management were not enjoyable.  Now I don't mean that the projects were not fun but that I did not enjoy the direction management was trying to form me.  Well to make a long boring story short I have decided to change my career path.  I am finishing my last two classes to get an A.A.  in Computer Graphic Design and then I am off to ITT Technical School to become and receive a B.A. in Computer Systems Networking Administration.  Not only do I feel that this is a much better field of work for me but it will also provide and support the kind of life style that I desire to have.  Well I hope that wasn't to boring or confusing for you if it was drop me an email and I'll explain it better for you.

      Yes, I am a complete slacker.  I apologize to all of you who have found my blog and have been reading it.  Fortunately, some of my experiences can be found at  urlLink MercuryFrog.com .  But as of late I have been extremely busy with many projects.  I have been repairing my friend Merc's bike.  I have been trying to find stone tiling that is stone shaped to put in our kitchen. I have also been making connections with a guy at SEMA  and at PriMedia.  Both working on publications for magazines.  I am really hopeful that PriMedia works out.  Especially since where I am at now is moving their graphics to Taiwan because that's where they do their printing.  Which kind of sucks because I just started to get into the groove here.

      Every day when I come home from work.  I see my baby girl and she smiles right at me.  She brings such a warm joyful feeling to my heart.  I get so excited when I see her, and as I look into her face I see how much she really resembles her mommy.  Then I am immediately reminded of my love and adoration for my wife and how I truly do love her and why I married her. Life brings so many challenges, hardships and frustrations but it also brings the most joys,  exhilarations and fun.  My two most precious and most valuable things in life are my Baby Girls, Heather and E.V. I love them deeply

      A few things are frustrating me at this point in my life.  Some important and some not so important. First the "Not So" I now have two web sites one for my business and one for my family and I (Heather, my wife and E.V.(Emily Victoria), my 5 month old little girl).  I have a splash page on  urlLink Clear Graphics Studios   that has already been changed just not posted and this site, mountaintoad.com.  This site is already progressing faster than the other and I have had Clear Graphics for about four years.  But I do have to mention my friend Christopher DeCaro  who has  assisted me in getting my crap together and getting these site up and semi running.  But at this time I unfortunately have to go and I cannot release my frustrations of the other sort at this time. So till next time when ever that maybe, hopefully sooner than later.  Peace to all.

      Hey,  I'm back from nowhere.  I have either been to lazy or have had absolutely no time  to do any of my crap.  I'll let you decide which one.  Well my little girl E.V.  is eight months old going on 20 years.  I knew that the first year of a child's growth and development was the fastest,  but you never fully understand or comprehend how fast until you have your own.  By the end of this week I will have a link to my photo album, there you will see what I mean.  Thoughs of you who know me and have seen E.V. pretty much know what I mean.  I miss my little baby girl.   I really can't complain too much though.  Life has been pretty good to us when I step back and look.  We own a condo and  we are looking into buying another.  We will rent out the other if all goes well.  I start my path towards my new career on Dec,  I am really excited about htis.  I must admit and that I would not be where I am today if were not for my wife.  Through my wife and her connection of people and friends,  I have been able to do so much and receive so much.   The experiences and training that I have gained and achieved have been made possible by my wife and our friends.   Thank you to all of you.  Sincerely,  MT

      Well,  I went boarding again and it was a mistake.  I was doing pretty good,  taken it slow and being careful.  Then I started going pretty good and then (WHAM!)..... must beath but can't  weeeze! gasp!   ooooooohhhhhh!.  A few minutes later I got up.  I landed pretty hard with my left elbow in my left side of my rib cage and nocked the wind out of me.  Well I either have a cracked or a bruised rib or a couple of ribs.  Hope to be better by Saturday,  which is when we go home.  ;]  MT

      Well,  We made it to Arizona and then to Utah.  Arizona we had one of my friends install some aftermarket Power door locks.  Which by the way if you have a Pontiac vehicle (we have a VIBE),  then you're going to have some issues getting them installed.  Pontiac has decided to change the door lock mechanisms.  Normally they are Rod driven which is why slim jimms are used to pop locks.  Pontiac has now changed them to Cable driven mechanisms.  So instead of it taking us 2hrs it took about 6hrs because we had rig it so it would work.  Don't worry it still looks and works as if the manufacturer installed them. ;]    So now we are in Utah at Park City.  My wife's parents have time shares and traded theirs for this one, It's pretty Swank.  Tonight we're going to Brighton and tomorrow we're going to The Canyons.  It's going to be pretty interesting because I haven't Boarded since I was 15 so that was 10 years ago SHEESH.  Well gotta go I'll update later this week I promise.    Happy Holidays,  MT

      Well,  I now finally employed as a graphic designer with the company that I have been temping at for 7 months.  I am pretty grateful about it.  Of course there still are some things I need to negotiate with them.  I also find out around the first of the year if I have an Internship with my wife's company in their IT Department.  School is still kick'en 'A'  and tomorrow I start my Christmas Vacation.  WOO HOO!  All in all life is good and we might even get a DBA and Business license for wife. Do to the fact that she will be quitting her job in about two to three months.  So as you can see our lives are becoming pretty eventful and challenging.  Happy Holidays to all whether I know you or not, ;]  MT

      Well I am in my second week of school at ITT,  I am really enjoying it.  They don't mess around with crap they just get right into it.  I even find the readying enjoyable and get this, I am even taking notes and highlighting key areas in my books.  I have never done that in my life, atleast not that I can remember. ;]    Be back soon.  MT

      Well the Doctor said I Probsbly cracked it.  But it would no good to Xray it becuase Wheather I Bruised, Cracked or Brocke it there was nothing he could do.  so I am wearing a brace and taking pain killers at night so I can sleep.  it seems to be doing much better now but it's probably just the pain killers.    MT

      I had this brilliant idea that once I got my school schedule that I would come into work an hour early  So I would be able to see my wife and little girl before school.  Well I today is my first time on this schedule.....I can't even think straight,  I can barely type this blog.  But it's worth it for just the reason I'm doing it for.  I also plan to go to the gym in the mornings that I don't have class (4am) I know it should be worth it but I'm going to have to ease that schedule in after I get use to this one.  But then again If I do it all at once it won't be so drawn out. Right?   CRAP!  You know Merc commented about the movie "28 days later".  Well I agreed with him that it sucked but the sad thing is, after watch it with him I can't get the movie out of my head.  I keep replaying it again and again in my head.  It's driving me nuts!  DON'T SEE IT!  MT

      Well for those of you who check my sight out again I have to apologize for slacking off.  Thus my title.  I hope I haven't made any one mad.  You would think for as much time as I spend with a computer I would be pretty consistent with updating this site.  SORRY!  Well it's the middle of March and I just started my second quarter at ITT.  Hey did you guys here they shut down 8 ITT schools last quarter about 4-5 weeks ago.  All it really is, is just a big corporation and with any large corporation you're going to run into some problems big and small.  Now I'm not saying that ITT sucks by any means.  I have really enjoyed it so far but I will say that in my area the schools are more of a way to get it done.  You really just get what ever you put into it.  Which is a lot like most schools.  The instructors will help you but you do lose some free access such as the computer labs.  You have access when you have the class.  If you don't have a computer at home your kind of screwed.  I guess I would have to say that If you're in the industry and you want to refresh or upgrade your knowledge base and certifications or you need flexibility with work and school then ITT is great.  Other wise I would say go to Devry or Phoenix or some other school like them.  I have learned a lot and I've established my own home network and server (W2K Advanced Server and Red Hat Linux).    On a side note.  I did have to set up one computer just for my wife and general use because She was getting pretty frustrated with me dinking with the computer and she would never be able to get on it when she wanted to.  So I now have three PC's and a MAC (2 PC's and the MAC for me and 1 PC for my wife).  Now we're a happy family.  Well I gotta go.  Just remember that School really is all about what you put into it.  MT

      Well,  The company that I am now working for, is turning out to be a pretty good company.  School is going well despite their ridiculous online course.  My baby girl is fourteen months and continues to amaze me with all that she learns.  I will soon have a site up called todderybarn.com where family photos and stuff will be posted.  All in all I can say life is pretty good I shouldn't have reason to complain, I have much to be grateful for.
