      Hmmm, anyone else think that this new Iraqi gov't is oversteppin the boundaries?  Axin, nay DEMANDIN to get bedhead Saddam back!!!!  WTF?  We spent so much time trackin him down n diggin him up out of his lil hole, why do they get to just take him away?  "Geneva Convention", my Aunt Fanny!    I think they should hold the next peace convention in Vegas... and let the big dogs show their peace keeping merchandise.  Caterpillar's house bulldozers, Patriot Missiles, Abrams, etc.  I would pay to goto that peace convention.  And plus they could have hot models showing off all the new toys.  Just picture some Rice Queen rubbin up against a shiny new 2005 Kofi Annan V8 turbo on a rotating platform.  Or perhaps a big booth to show off Nelson Madela's new "Apartheid-n-sleep."  There could be a divider in the tent so that white kids wouldn't have to sleep in the same part as the black kids! But don't worry, it would still make bedtime FUNtime, with novel scenes from Transformers embroidered into the tent.  And then they could have Neville Chamberlain toilet tissue.  "In my hand, I hold a piece of paper... as soft and absorbent as it comes.  When it comes to my ass, I make no compromises."  On a related note, "Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain" is an anagram of " Lame Premier: Hitler's invincible, man! "  Awesome.    Anyways, I totally smell another war.  Let's bomb the crap outta this interim gov't, George.  Let's find you a place at the new improved Geneva-brand convention.  Just to show how multicultural you are, we can hold it at the Aladdin casino next year.  Seriously, George, you aint gunna let Ayad Allawi walk all over ya, are ya?  Let's show him what peace-loving is all about.

      Now, this may make me sound like a very unreasonable man, but it really gets me when THE MAN comes in and takes my mug.  If (t/s(he)y) wanna clean mug, they should bring in one of (their/his/her) own and keep it clean (themselves/him-/her-self).  This also goes for permanent markers.... you KLEPTO(s)!!!  Now, you may accuse me of throwing my toys... which I have been known to do on occasion... but this is really quite different.  On another note, today officially marks the first day of mourning for my triops.  Alas, they have passed (down the drain).

      Looks like my media lab account is back up.  Booyah.  Also, Jason X is on tv.  Does life get any better than this.  By the way, I never realized how close India is to Israel. On another note, Tony and I went to this Indian restaurant today.  All you can eat buffetm 7.95.  GBP of course.  Watered down pepsi, 1.50 a pop.  Every table around us complained about their bill, sayin that crap had been added to it, or that they were offered stuff in a complimentary manner, and then charged for it.  Well, with us, the worst we got was a 10% cover charge.  but, what the hell... wtf is a cover charge on a buffet????  It's funny that they charged us that cuz service was not included in the bill.  nor was it included in the money we gave to those scheisters.  I got cowboy bebop the movie on dvd this morning.  awesome awesome awesome.  cant wait to watch it.  the series was incredible.  FINALLY, I'd like to annouce that I am finally happy with my edit of "Corollary."  It has a new soundtrack to it, drums n crap.  Sounds good.  Gets noisy.  like me.      On another note, I met a girl from UMass amherst today who had been at a virginia woolf convention.  She was supercool!  Kinda wish that she lived in London, cuz when me, Mat, Tony and her were all drinking coffee together on high street ken, we had a super fun time.  Maybe Im finally grown up enuf to read V. Woolf.  Actually, scratch that.  Still haven't taken off my chainmail of maturity+1.  plus, I seem to be enjoying Jason X far too much.  I hate everyone in space, and hope they all die.

      Man, o man.  Do you ever REALLY wanna talk about something in public, but it's just not appropriate due to the proximity old older people or youngsters, or perhaps the person who you are makin fun of???  Well, when I have dinner with Tony... that happens alot.  Today, just feet away from this lil 8 year old girl sharing a pizza with her werther's original grandpa, our conversations ran over topics from young teenage sex, to violent filmmaking, to pyromaniac sexaholics.... i think i wanna make a film about the 3rd one.  We had to talk really quietly so that people around us only thought we were gay lovers and not total weirdos who were talking about the pleasure of eating blood and making throw-up noises.  Does anyone else here love to make throw-up noises?  I think the whole throw-up package is kinda fun.  Kinda like you're breathing fire, except it's goopey and filled with carrots.  But that reminds me of one of life's little conundrums.  If you copulate with someone's ashes... is that still necrophilia?  Another thing..... it is TOTALLY fine to swallor your gum... so quit tellin me otherwise.  Seriously.  I have done my research.   urlLink check here   Next up... I showed the sir mixalot baby got back video to a buncha english fellers today. Can u believe they had never seen it b4?????  or even heard the song!  I've said it b4 and i will say it again...

      So, back in September 03, I bought a new Dell D800.  September: Worked for 5 mins, then it died.  Needed a new Mobo.  A guy came by n replaced it pretty quickly.  October: Dude forgot to put my Bluetooth module back in.  What a winner.  Dell sent me a new one.  December: CPU had been crashing randomly for a couple months. Turned out I had a bad stick of RAM.  Dell replaced it.  March 04: Zipper #1 breaks on my Dell DELUXE Nylon carrying case.  not too big a deal since it is on a compartment that I rarely use.  The case now looks like crap from that side... like the mouth of the boogie man from the nightmare b4 xmas.  (x is the first letter of the name for Christ in greek.  They often abbreviate christ as x, hence xmas.)  Deluxe?  is that like FANCY cut carrots?  May 04: Thought my power brick had gone bad.  Had to jiggle the plug alot to get the cpu to charge up.  Dell sent me a new one.  No luck.  Still acted up. Got so bad that it couldnt even charge up anymore.  [Never had to send back the power brick.]  Took a couple more days e-mailing Dell to work out the motherboard had gone bad, again. Dude came by to replace it at school one day.  He was wearing a suit.  Did a nice job, I thought....  A lil later:  Is it just me, or is my LCD not as bright as it used to be???  Next day: Upgradin my BIOS, what do I see? Hey, this aint the right mobo.  They gave me one for the M60 workstation.  Compatible and works the same, except I cant use the same page I used to to update all my drivers n crap... now have to use 2 different one on the dell website.  inconvenient.  A lil later:  Whats this under my left wrist?  A crack propogating on the wrist rest area of the case... slowly gets worse.  Embarrassing as hell, thinking I had bought a quality laptop with good build.  I was wrong.  Tolerable, but annoying.  June 04:  I go home to see my folks.  On the train, I try to unzip my case, and the zip pull breaks off in my hand.  On the main compartment: frustration meter goes from lower cheek level to mid eye level.  lower half of eyes bloodshot as if yogi bear just stole my picanic basket.  Later:  I get home from my folks' house and write to dell.  They tell me Im writing to the wrong people and they cant find my service account.  What?  Send em back my last service email only to receive the metaphorical slap in the forehead email accompanied by "our computers were broken."  go figure. Turns out laptop case falls under wear n tear, my ass.  Lame, patronizing instructions given to fix my monitor brightness problem.  "Tighten the screws".  JFC!!!!  Or should that be JFX!!!  They request pictures of my crack.  On the case.  This is not bearpics.com, thank you very much.  How's it all gunna end, Truman?  Dude, you're getting a Dell.  "Fuck"

      I went to one of the films that was part of the NFT Lesbian Film season. A swedish film called "Show Me Love"  high school lesbian love story.  REAAAAAALLLY AWESOME.  I think I am actually a self-conscious 13 year old swedish lesbian on the inside.  Lets look at the criteria: You feel like every teenage girl thinks u r an ugly loser.  Check.  You draw lots of hearts and stars in your notebook.  Check.  You have an endless supply of chewing gum representative of your unending sexual frustration.  Check. You think that you and John Goodman could easily be more than friends.  Check.  hold on... how did that get in there.  Do you ever feel like that too?  Tony aptly noticed that in every lesbian themed movie we've seen to date, the women always make out to 80s power ballads.  "Show me Love" had one courtesy of foreigner.  Can you guess the song????  Gosh, there are so many great candidates.  So in case u were wondering where I went... I was back in hereforshire with my folks, the cats and the dog.  great food, great folks, and i got lots of crap work done.  My dissertation is gunna suck so hard, which is a shame, cuz I think it is about an interesting topic.  but really, I'd rather put my thoughts into practice rather than compare them with Paul Wells' mis-spelt theories of animation.  I find it quite the joke that we are discouraged from using internet resources due to their reliability, while heavily encouraged to consult a book like Paul Wells' "Understanding Animation" which hasnt even gone thru a spellchecker.    My blog does not go thru a spellchecker.  It is one-hundert persent pure Ian speling.  You can be impressed now.  Shut up.  Im dyslexic or something.  You dont know how many stupid things I say because of my disability.  Well, since Im in a commie country like Europe, I think I deserve something from the government to compensate for my suffraging.  How about a computer.  Go on tony, send us one.  but if u send me a frickin gandhi color imac, i will be so pissed... you know, the brown translucent imac where you can see the bones on the inside.... :-P  You cant call me a racist.  that was my dyslexia talkign.  aight, i am gunna get back to work.  Cowboy Bebop roolz.  I wanna see the movie.  Fieldmarshal lesbIAN

      Ok, so I finally finished the video for the Beta Band's song "She's So Wonderful."  It will be up on my site soon. I have been working as an animator for an RCA Communications student, Nina Chakrabarti.  Really super duper experience.  We did 5 mins of animation in about a week!  (Thanks very much to after effects.  No thanks to apple quicktime.)  It has lots of floating kittens and all sorts of kitsch (sp?) cutout animation, flowers, horsies, hearts stars, etc.  looks like it has been sponsored by Lucky Charms.  Anyways, as a thank you, Nina bought me the most AMAZING cake from Patisserie Valerie.  I will take a picture of it before I munch it, cuz jeezy creezy is it rad.  So if any of y'all ever get a chance to work with Nina, you should jump at the chance.  Great director and supercool.

      "First, the european union came for the hate speech.  And I was silent. Then, they came for the biased publications.  And I was quiet. Then, they came for animation blogs, and I had no mouth left to scream."  Or something.  Anyways, kudos to the Europeans for this conference.  If you ever feel at a loss for words, it won't matter, cuz you probably weren't allowed to ssy them anyway.  Sure, hate speech is a problem... but what good will  urlLink banning  it do????

      Yes, Euro 2004 is upon us... kick kick head kick trap whistle kick goal. We're already starting to see how Britain takes losing...  Goddamn... can u imagine what woulda happened if they'd lost WWII?  I mean if Uncle Sam didn't come in to save the day. There'd be all sorts of riots!  Total chaos in the streets.  Police beaten up!  Buildings burned down!  And the Germans would be all like "WTF mein fuhrer?  They are trashing all their own hauses unt throwing all their toys."  Anyways, today I went to go see an animation studio in the middle of Soho.  Some nice people working there, but it was actually pretty dead.  No energy in the studio, no interesting decoration, nothing inspirational whatsoever, just a few computers and no AC.  Wonder what it would be like workin there... I mean, I got into animation cuz it is fun and energetic and constantly pushin ya... this place was sorta the antithesis.  TIme to start my own studio???  And it wouldnt have to be in Central London, either where you pay millions of pounds for a broom closet of an office.  Anyone wanna work with me?  'Tranimation?'

      Welcome to the western world.  My MPIO headphones crapped out on me last nite... the wire bust on the inside, so I gotta replace em.  Went to 5 shops in Notting Hill this morning looking for them... couldnt find ANY.  Went to all the shops that were open tonight at 6:30 on high Street Ken.  Found one total crap pair in Virgin--looked like they would give em away to economy passengers on Rwanda Air.  For 10 squids at that.  jeezy creezy.  Anyways, it is gettin nice n warm in London now.  I can wear shorts.  hoorah.  This evening, Tony and I weren't gettin much work done in the studio, so it was clear that it was time to spin.  Hold your arms out, spin around as fast as you can, jump up in the air a couple times, and spin some more.  Drink a couple cups of coffee.  Repeat until vomit.  It was fun.  Today, I got the job of organizing the animation year end trip.  Gunna try to get 2 boats to take up the thames nr Windsor.  What do ya do with 24 drunken sailors?  "Roger the Cabin Boy."  My gym still has no warm water.   Been like that since Friday. I can tell you it is a real pleasure to shower there after a workout.  Once again, go England.  By the way, England lost to France yesterday.  Could it be because France has such good  strikers ???  Socialism sucks.  Actually, it's a bummer about all that.  I dont care about 'football' all that much... but losing to France... c'mon.  COME ON!  Last night, I saw the new Italian movie "I am not scared."  Melodramatic, uninspiringly shot, poorly characterized.... blugh.  Some pretty wheatfields.  And Mat jumped out of his seat like a lil girl at one point with a very audible "eek!"  Hahahahahaha.  At least I didnt see that Toni Colette flick "Japanese Story" or whatever.  Heard it was Johnny Wilkinson kick you in the goolies awful.  Tony and I had a discussion today.  We need to make mindlessly controversial films next year.  No, they're not big or clever or shut the hell up.  But for some reason, I feel like stirrin stuff up a bit.  Art school should be a bit more open-minded.  Finally, why do I have to hand in my dissertation draft on Friday afternoon?  NOONE will read it until Tuesday at the very earliest.  So what the hell is the point?  Should I hand it in on Monday out of protest???  Now THAT is controversial.  It's 11 O'clock PM and I have about 2 mins of this animation done.  Out of like 5.  Argh.  Some of it looks pretty good tho.   And the motion sketch feature in After Effects 6 is neat.  Go Adobe.  Solid program boys n girls.  Just in case u were wondering, Flash still bones my meatgrinder.

      So I went to the RCA end of year fashion show today...  and it was rad as hell.  It gave me all sorts of ideas about designing clothes n stuff.  When I have my first fashion show, the supermodels are gunna throw candy out into the audience.  And I think women need faux chesthair.  K, here are a couple new 'IN' things I noticed for all you fashion-oriented people out there:  - Islam is IN!  That's right, choose your favorite arabic garb and combine it with something totally western to be in the height of fashion on Britain's high streets.  Shall we call it pret a deportee?  - Unrolling your turtleneck and covering the lower half of your head no longer means that you are hiding skin problems.  - Musique rap francais.  - Calling yourself Butch.  - Clamshell's on your head.  - The greengrocer's apostrophe.  - Alternatives to the European Union. (Down with EU mediocrity!)  The rest of the day I worked on my moooosic veeeeedeeeeooooooo, and watched Ronnie Reagan's ceremonies on the box for a bit.  Ronnie, on behalf of the Notting Hill Log Cabin Republicans, we salute you.

      Ok, so for those of you who don't know, when one "drops the H-BOMB", one tells ones peers that one has been educated at Harvard University.  Clap clap clap. So, some group of students from the aforementioned University got together to make a "lit and arts" mag.  Hoo-bloody-ray.  But here is a twist; it's 'sexy.' Check it out  urlLink here .  Obviously google finds H-bomb very sexy, considering the  urlLink ads  they've put on the page.  "Body armour UK"... sexy, but I don't think I share that riot police pepper spray fantasy with most people.  "Bomb blast security film"... I can't think of why this is appropriate, but I'm sure it has nothing to do with Caterpillar Armored Bulldozers.

         I saw the queen of england today.  She was being dashed thru notting hill in her jag.  She had a motorcade of bike cops usherin her carriage thru the city.  She zipped by and had a pretty anxious look on her face.  Though she is not rumoured to be the most generous person in the world, I think she was busting to spend a penny.  She was wearing her hunter's glasses too.  Growl.  The Queen | Me | Mrs Doubtfire  That sounds like one HELL of a sandwich.  I went to a poetry reading tonight.  There was an american dude and an english dude.  America won, naturally.  YES, you can have competitive poetry reading.  The English feller was actually pretty good, but I liked the american guy cuz he was funny and spoke about math and babies.  Also went to a competition briefing.  Visa wants us to redesign the credit card.  booyah.  I reckon if I get my act together, I can make a soopah doopah proposal.  So far, though, all I can think of is replacing the dove hologram with a 3d image of a family having their car repossessed.  one of the kids is in a wheelchair... which is also being repossessed.

        I think Max would be better at grooming than Kyan, cuz he doesnt say "work it in from the back" all the time. We all know what you are thinking there, Kyan.

      First off, KUDOS to British rail.  They are ALWAYS on time and get you there without a hassle and with the greatest possible customer courtesy.  Clap frickin clap clap, guys.  A'ight, so it was ok once I was out of that pit named Swindon... let's not even go there.  I got on the train PRAYIN that the crazy on the platform wasn't gunna come be crazy next to me.  He was your typical type of trainstation loon; shouting at the pigeons, or perhaps the air between him and the pigeons, and then random people on the platform.  I think we kinda bonded once he saw that I was readin "Experimental Cinema" by David Curtis on the trainstation platform.  That book it so serious, it dont even get a cover.  Only gold embossed lettering.  It has been in the RCA library since about 1978 when it was published and it has been taken out.... thrice... three lucky people got to read endless lists of obscure german film directors followed by "were quite important."  So far, my experience in film theory leads me to believe that film academia is all about listing off names of films and people, people n films and then saying how frickin amazing they were without any justification or explanation except for self-coined terms such as "Richter-Reifenstahal-esquian absurditized kinetic harmonization" or some equivalent bullshit.  Can you tell Im enjoying researching my dissertation?  I read a chapter in a film aesthetics book today all about why I need to take hallucinogenics.  My left brain, allegedly, is dominating my life.  I need to find my personal manadala in my dreamstate and transpose it into my filmmaking.  I wonder if you can have ascii mandalas.  Stare at this for a while and tell me what you think....   :-P*  Have you transcended?  Or perhaps just grossed out?  I have that effect on people.  I got a lil sunburn today, so i know Im gunna have scary dreams all about spiders and fire ants crawling all over my body.  Contrary to popular belief, this will not give me a wet dream.  If it were Mrs Doubtfire, though, HELLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOO!  mmmm yeah.  Speaking of which, can anyone tell me what happened at the end of the Bodyguard?  I know that Farmer and Rachel smooched, but in the next shot he is like defending the pope?  Do they have milano babies?  Or is he totally Bobby Brownnin her?  I think that movie is really good.  Kevin Costner has a funny haircut in it.  Looks like his mom did it or something.  Better than the hair that he sported in Robin Hood: Prince of thieves, tho...  And now as a diversion from that totally emasculating comment, Im going to bitch about the remark my friend tony left on this blog.  he said "You're so GAAAY. your site is GAAAAY GAY GAY GAY GAY. From Tony (who's not gay)"  Clearly, tony is gay.  i mean, who else knows the correct spelling of "You're" besides homos, speak and spell, and Nick.  No, nick went to Harvard or something.  Yeah, I know, it's not like it's that amazing.  Why does he got to be so in your face about it?  I mean, HELLLOOOO, affirmative action for hermaphrodites.  Nick got good grades cuz he could sleep with all of his professors....  Anyways, back to Tony.  Tony wears vertical stripes, has a moustache, owns an apple, and likes art.  And pronounces it "Ahhhht".  Clearly as gay as Elijah Wood.  Plus, I find him looking at my signed picture of John Goodman alot.  ALOT.  Let's not touch the fact that I own a picture of John Goodman though, k?  So now Im back in London, land of the friendly bus drivers, clean air, heaps of people who speak english competently, and low low prices.  but it's all good, cuz tomorrow I get to start working on my video for the Beta Band.  booyah.  I know one of their songs, and Im only doin some after effects work for the video... but what the heck, it'll be much way funner than writing my dissertation.  I cant believe you made it this far.  Go to bed. Seriously dude, have u seen my USB cable for my camera?

        I think this paper is gunna be a real winner...  No, I  swear  I'm not asleep in this photo.  Went to an antiques fair today.  What a load of crap.  Does 'antique' really mean £200 faux-turkmenistanian testicle shapers?  I thought egg shaped was optimal for sperm production... but if you force each of your nuts into growing into long curly shapes, I hear it does ya real good.  They kinda look like crazy straws, but not the sort that you wear as a pair of glasses and you watch the grape soda goes fizzing around your eyes, slowly dislodging the chunks of milk that you never could manage to clean out of there... kinda reminds me of those ladies that lactate club sandwiches.  I hear they put the toothpicks through them after they come out.  Forgot to mention I was with my folks.  We ate Lobster sashimi for lunch.  Well, it was actually cooked, but chilled.  My mom made it.  Yum.  Tasted like Octopus.  I  am  special.

      This mornin, I got up waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay early so that I could catch an early train from Paddington to Gloucester.  Pricey as nuts, but s'worth it to come home.  We spent the day grooming the dog n cats... gave Max a shampoo!  Now he is so shiny and clean that he loves to lick his coat.  I spent most of the late afternoon in the gardern: reading, taking pictures, workin on my dissertation, playin with the cats... soo nice to be out of London--one of the most oppressive atmospheres in the world.   Plus, when I come home, my diet changes significantly.  It is no longer a choice between hummous and a tube of mustard, but a whole smorgasbord of awesome home made food.    Cant wait for breakfast, tomorrow.  Mama made a sunflower seed loaf of bread.... drool.  Donnington raspberry jam on top.  Booyah.  I ate prunes for dinner yesterday... they were good, until my stomach felt like it encapsulated the frickin west bank.  Do you ever get the impression that my life as a single feller in London is mostly sad and retarded?  Dont forget that I do art...

      Today I went to the RCA End of Year Show part I.  Best thing in there were these big woodblock prints by a guy called  Richard Galloway.  Showed off the seedy side of brit pub culture.  Pretty rad stuff.    A jeweller named Jin-Kyu Jeong also put on a good show with some natural office supplies... like a note holder that is also a lil fishtank or a pencilcase that had a lil grass and gravel garden in it.  Good stuff.  As for painting, a fella names James Connoly (sp?) did some pretty decent paintings about goofy subjects like "a garden gnome stealing another garden gnome" and "pork pies from space".    If anyone is reading this, and actually gets a chance to go see the show, you definitely should.  Some of the stuff is pretty damn incredible, and the presentation gets an A+.  Art sucks less becuase of this show.  Hurrah.

      Queer Eye's Thom sits astride a horse as king arthur.     OMG, this movie KING ARTHUR was soooo fuckin horrible... first off, the story is total utter like the homeless guy with elephantiasis awful...  some crap about freedom for the english people... what garbage.  This dude arthur is a freakin europhile... comin over from rome makin sure that britain is an integral part of the EU in 300 AD, also known as the roman empire, but that is just semantics.   THe round table looks seriously like the eurpoean assembly, and all these frickin knights are total blind buffoons that want a common currency throughout dark ages europe.  The Saxons, the funny barbarian fellas with yankee accents, just want freedom to do what they want and burn shit up.  Im sure that Arthur just wants to get a bunch of Polish immigrants into england so that he can appease his franco-germanic masters burdened with this erm, borderline, problem.  What a sellout.  And what the fuck?  All the knights of the round table come from some bullshit place in Eastern Europe... fuckin Brussels or something.  "We are the knights of the round table... and we have come to liberate you from the toils of your self-established meritocracy... LONG LIVE THE BUREAUCRATIC WELFARE STATE!"  Then the knights all rip off their armor to reveal their Job Centre uniforms so they can dispense the medieval dole to the now unmotivated peasant population...  This movie felt like it was directed by a piss-poor european director who was tryin his best to copy an american hollywood director, but missed the mark just enuf to make it worse than a "Beneath a killing moon" cutscene.  It is soooo badly done.  The Europeans (surely there is a more fun way of describing the Europeans collectively...) can make REALLY awesome films, and they DO!  So why bother copyin the tired american format... jeezy creezy europe.  Grow a pair... curretly your nuts are the size of Luxembourg and Lichtenstein... but it could be a tactic.  As they say "small potatoes make the meat look bigger".  As these 2 testicular countries are either side of france, that would make France one giant wang, no? Portugal is a foreskin. Maybe we can call them (the europeans) the incontinentals, since we are on such a mature theme right now.  Anyway, so concludes my movie review.  Kiera Knightly dresses up like Voldo from Soul Calibur and fights like a retard with a new set of crayons.  All in all one big rotten pile of Nigerian handshake victims with missing genitalia.  King Arthur was a commie.  M Night Shyalaman still sucks nuts even if his trailer did make me jump.  Edward Hopper exhibition tomorrow, and work sstill rocks.

      I was talking about how KFC sucks here.  That does not mean it don't suck in the states, too, bur at least there it is Kentucky Fried Chicken.  A little too loudly, I said it was Kuwaiti Fried Chicken here... and alighted immediately at the next stop.  Tony and I have set ourselves a new challenge, pretending that we're back in high school.  When the tube is so loud that you cant hear anything but the squeel of wheel on rail friction, you have to see how loud you can shout something before you get a funny look from someone who hears what you're actually talking about...  i will let yer minds wander on the sort of stuff we might be saying.  but what the hell, london deserves it.  Hmmmm... today was a really good day at work.  I got a lot of lipsynching done and had some good chats with my boss, Mat.  He reminds me of Eddie Izzard cuz he is so cleverly funny... not just idiotically perverted like yours truly.  Anyways, I really like working there right now.  Let's hope things stay that way!  Finally, who really wants to vote democrat and not just vote anti-repulican right now?  Kerry is such a wet mess dork.  WHERE'S WESLEY CLARK???? STEP UP GENERAL HOTSTUFF!!!!!  BTW, i am nearly done with  urlLink "The Butcher Boy" .  Great book.  Kinda like Clockwork orange in Ireland with a young kid who grows up in a crappy household... FUCK OFF FISH!!!!  I also wanna tell this marble mouthed Londoner jerkweed outside my window to shut the Eff up.  Seriously, talking real loud on yer cellphone in the street at midnight is so eurotrashy.  SOOOOOOO Eurotrashy.

      TOny and I decided TODAY was an ORANGE Wednesday. For those of u who dont know what that is... it's a promotion by Orange (the cell phone company) where you get 2 movie tix for the price of 1 on wednesdays.  Good deal.  Me n tony paid 2.25 each to see a flick tonight...  BUT JESUS CHRIST I WANT MY 225 pennies BACK!  And those 2 hours... we were going to see shrek 2-which i didnt totally WANNA see, but it would be educational from an animator's viewpoint- but OF COURSE TOny had already seen it.  The sod.  So there was ONE movie that we had not seen... ONE FLIPPING movie...  by a fella called Richard Linklater... titled "Before Sunset" aka "Before Sunrise 2"  OMFG, wasnt the title a warning?!??!??  Anyways, in short, this lame couple consisting of the sensitive male author who ponders about love and crap but is now an unhappily married family man and a female feminist activist frenchie with stupid things to say about relationships and writes garbage songs about the guy who thinks they're really sweet, but in fact they dont compare to anything by right said fred ("You're my mate" anyone?) or Xanadu by olivia newton john...  where was I... yeah, the film was garbage.  And it takes place in paris and is snobbish about the yanks... but i dont care about that so much... cuz paris is this decaying old city which mandates the presence of coffeeshops every 3 inches to cover up the stench of rotting socialism.  And you can't sell Nazi memorobilia there... not even at costume stores.  I bet u cant even grow that tiny hitler moustache without being arrested.  Or if you happen to Sig Heil a cab... off you go into the slammer with Robespiere...   Today was a good day tho.  had fun at work.  Awesome lunch with MAT at a really good BBQ restaurant in soho.  Proper vinegar BBQ pulled pork sandwich... and really good freedom fries.  Mat loaned me a dvd with some cool animation on it... Koji Yamamura's Mt Head, Don Hertzfeldt stuff and a couple other things i aint watched yet.  But christ, "Rejected" by Don Hertzfeldt is so funny...  i like his style of non-pc and hilariously tragic violence juxtaposed with the saccharine moments in life. For example:   Baby stands up and starts walking around clumsily  Off stage: Look Honey.... our baby's first steps! Audience: Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...  Baby walks around some more Baby falls down massive staircase Audience hoots and cheers!   That skit, I believe, was a proposed ad for a Johnson and Johnson product... or something.  It is funny.  Go find his stuff.  Aight, it is midnight, and time for me to goto sleep.  Vote UK Independence.  England deserves a new paintjob!!!!

      Dear Diary,  Today I met a fella who doesn't think same sex couples should have kids.  His argument was that a proton and a proton don't react.  A lion pees and roars at other males.  In nature, you don't have gay animals.  Something about smashing a glass table with your fist.  Also, he didn't have a dad when he was growing up.  Since the guy aint a native english speaker (IN LONDON?!!??!), it was hard to follow him at times, but I took in what he was saying.  Also, paedophiles are limited by the government in the name of protecting kids.  In conclusion, gay marriage is wrong. And don't punch tables unless you can think of advantages and disadvantages.  U see???  This was a very one-sided discussion, cuz i was being beaten around the head with total nonsense arguments.  Any time you try to look at things objectively, "I DIDNT HAVE A DAD" pops up.  ANy time you talk about love between two people... "PROTONS AND PROTONS."  Eventually, I had to go cuz my chicken was getting cold and I realized that homo love it totally wrong and yes, Bush should be president because he protects our unborn children.  We are leavin them one hell of a world.  I see gay bears all the time.  Growl.

      SERIOUSLY, u think I would ditch you with that garbage?  ESEPCIALLY after leaving both of you hanging for all these days???  DO YOU HAVE ANY FINGERNAILS LEFT??!?!?!?!?!?!?  I am a new type of closet case...  when ya meet new people, and they're all talking about 'funny' things like the size of Lord Jizztrap's ego in comparison with his stockholdings (HOOT, i tell ya!), or about witty political satires that imply that George Bush is actually a Saudi Prince (Michael Moore is just in it for the money, tho he does make some valid points... did I mention he is going to spend all that money on Concorde Grape Flavored Wet to pump thru his slip-n-slide), do you ever feel like you have nothing appropriate to say???  Is it at THAT MOMENT the thing that you find funniest in the world is the cesaerian section??? just because???  Or perhaps the lyrics to your favorite AC song... "I just saw the gayest guy on earth", "You look divorced!", "I snuck a retard into a sperm bank"... etc.  Well, that is the way that I feel around new people.    Or maybe I want to talk about my newest idea for a film that tastefully mixes misdirected paedophilia with self-mutilation?  NO THIS IS NOT BIOGRAPHICAL.  Anyways, as you might have guessed, I was uncharacterstically quiet today: my first day at my new job.  I am animating for a video games company, doin lipsync and facial animation in Maya.  S'good.  I wont give you any details tho, cuz who the hell really cares about my pro life anyways.  I made it halfway into the ladies' toilet before I was stopped... no i was not looking for film inspiration.   I was just lookin for someone to talk to, i swear.  Anyways, it is a great way to start off at yer new job, no?  It really breaks the ice with so many of your colleagues.  With the fellas i get to field questions like "So, what color are the tiles in there? Do they match the porcelain?"  And with the girls, they ask "Do you know that if I stand just the right way it kinda looks like Indonesia?"  Yeah, kudos to me.  Let's hope tomorrow goes better.  I belted out some songs about transexuals in the park on the way home.  Fuck London. Oxford st is packed at 6:30 on a weekday.  makes you very klrosstruhfowbick (sp?).  I find myself saying especially evil things about moving "your goddamn satan spawn before i find a tablesaw sale" or "deportation" or "watch yerself, blindie"... i have little patience for the Londonian visually impaired anymore.  I was ripped off by a blind guy while I was doing him a favor...  Freakin SOB hooked on my arm, and said "Onwards to notting hill NatWest Bank", and i was all like "ok, im a good person, i can do this..."  Along the way, screwy-eyes makes his best effort to look my way and hold out a hand with 2 50pence pieces.  "I got 2 50 Ps.  Can I get a pound coin from you?"  Most magnanimously, I reply, "Of course, my squinty unwashed friend, here you are!" And I place my shiniest 1 pound coin in his hand.  For a brief moment, the queen's head glinted in the sunshine... I thought I saw her blow a kiss at me and my heart melted like an ice sculpture at a cricketmatch betweeen two of the browner parts of the empire... ever so briefly...before that troll of a cripple closed his filthy-nailed fist around my recently departed regal tender and its paired septagonal  silver counterpart.  JESUS FUCKIN CHRIST I WAS PISSED.  Instead of leading him to the bank, I took him to the Grail Cave at Alexandretta.  I'd like to see him spell Jahova in Latin...  Anyways... all in all, London bites the big one on occasion.  HOWEVER, SOMETIMES it is good. I enjoy spending time with my friends Tony n Mat n Martin.  Tony and I played video games this evening at a real arcade.  Was in the Muslim part of town.  It can be totally weird seeing a woman in her  urlLink "emperor's royal guard"  uniform (what is the real name for those???) serving out bowling shoes to a customer...  [visual analogy credit to tony]  Mat, his sister, and I saw Harry Potter and the Prizner of khazahkhshthan at the IMAX yesterday.  Pretty enjoyable movie methinks... not a standalone classic, but a good chapter in the HP series.  My conclusion about the IMAX is this: it is cool to go once.... but it's just the same as sitting in the front row at the movie theater... except it is cheaper... and you dont have to wait an extra 4 months for the movie to come out....  I love the movies.  I think i would enjoy hiring out a cinema for a day and just sitting in the total darkness... sensory deprivation rules.  Lucky fuckin blind bastard.  On a final note, I handed in my dissertation on Friday.  That is why I hadnt written in my blog for so long.  lame excuse I know... but i was workin pretty hard on it.  Still turned out like crap though, as one would expect.  At one point, I liken a direct animator to a rodeo cowboy... "Can I have an R please Pat?" "There are 8 R's"  "I'd Like to solve the puzzle!"  "Go ahead"  "RETARRRRRRRD?"  On that note, I have to retire to bed.  more tomorrow, methinks.  My thanx to all who read my garbage and write back!  *SUCKER PUNCH*

      I am Jesus. I'm standing in the middle of route 66, nothing around me, except for some road signs here and there, some fields, somedirt, wind kinda blowin gently....totally peaceful.  Then, I put on some goggles that help me to fulfill the prophecy of the black sun. Immediately, my world changes to a whole universe made out of fire. Everything around me is burning, and there are skulls and all laughing at me and dancing around shooting AOLIM smileys at me. But it's ok, cuz I'm Jesus, and I can wake up anytime that I like.  Or so i thought, but everytime I woke up I was still a burning Jesus, surrounded by skulls laughing at me.... and so the story goes.

      OMG, my brother Jim has the pox.  Watch out for him!  He has been sleeping on the streets and getting cold.  He bought himself a Saddam Hussein "Masters of the Universe" comforter from somewhere, prolly some other hobo.  He slowly withered away, living on the streets of this Boston-Lonon Hybrid, where Imperial College had a cafeteria merged with a basketball court, and every student was foreign. They were also half way through the renovation of one of their student residences.  It was taking forever, and students were getting impatient.  Anyway, as Jim got skinnier and skinnier, I spent more time with him, cuz I had to look after him.  I was getting really cold one day, so he gave me his Saddam Hussein comforter. I was getting sicker and sicker, got skinnier and skinnier, and lost all my strength.  One day, Jim let me in on his secret; he had rubella and now I had it too!  That Saddam Hussein blanket gave it to the both of us.  He laughed and laughed and laughed.... I like to think that his laughter turned into coughing which eventually caused him to a baby calf erupting from his throat, encased in that big gooey amniotic sack.  He should really have that looked at.  Poor sod, maybe we'll both die in the sequel, and we can watch our own funeral as ghosts in the newly finished Imperial College student residence.  If we were buried in pet sematary, would we come back to life with rubella?

      I went to the Saaaaaaaaaaatchi gallery yesterday.  OMG, it was cool. Sooooooooooo much better than the Tate modern... except it aint free.  And the gallery is a lot smaller.  But nothing is corded off, it ain't super crowded, and the art in it is just thought provoking and interesting for people across the whole spectrum.  If you don't mind a bit of nudity, you can totally take yer folks or yer (maturish) kids and see lots of amazin stuff--dead dad is cool.  a 1/3 size replica of yer dead dad lying on the floor. About as real lookin as they come, but he's portable!  Kinda like being xfromed into ashes... but not.  Anyways, go see 'im.  Damien hirst is a hit for everyone.  Sharks, sheep in formaldehyde. Gynecological fishtanks.  Wholesome fun.  Tracy Emmins is kinda dull, though.  A bit too conceptual for my tastes. You have to know what she is trying to say before you look at her work, and then you can get it.  but since it doesn't speak to you outside of a given context, I dont really see the point.  Anyways, tony and I went together and had a super time.  We even made some friends along the way... 4 fellas that we saw on Old Compton St a lil later on!  I had NO IDEA they were homos. wink wink.  And I had no idea that Tony and I were following 20 paces behind them for about 30 mins after we left the gallery.  No idea.  Really.  one of them did look like Steve Hurley tho.... AKA T_tp__. ;-)  AND OMFG, there was one room in th gallery that was jhust SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cool, i couldnt believe it.  You walk in the door and there is a waist high steel wall on 3 sides of you (and the door opening is behind you).  When you look closely over the side of the wall, you realize that u aint seein the floor, but a reflection of the ceiling.  And upon closer inspection, u realize that the room is half filled up with OIL!  (Can you have a room half-emptied of oil?  Maybe if there were a precedent to fill rooms with oil.... hmmm)  It's a big black reflection pool... and the oil goes right up to the very brim of this wall.  if u touch it, it will definitely spill.  So go see it... but be careful.  Right, well, I am back in the countryside now with my folks.  GUnna do some work on my dissertation while IM here, like u all care.  I made some wrapping paper for mama's b-day present which I thought was cool.  Not sure if my aesthtic is shared by my folks, tho.  :-P  Pics will be available soon.  Oh, I got her a copy of "Me talk pretty one day" which all three of you should read.  It's by David Sedaris, a catty homo fella with a great sense of humor.  Kinda reminds me of Adam Boulter, the RCA Animation admin, but in a yankee way.  Adam is more international--have a look at his site,  urlLink  here  .  Max, the dog, and I spent some quality time together today.  We chased Harriet, the barn cat with a saggy belly, up a tree where it meowed for ages and i felt bad until snake and bert the cool cats came to congratulate me.  Max and I caught a moth in the field, and let it loose after it tickled my hands too much.  I was quite jealous.  I would love to be picked up by a giant fella and contained by his fascination with me. THey dont realize how lucky they are.  But my old cat, Kit Kat, used to eat moths.... and I dont think I'd be into that.  And now that Im home, Heike Kagero and I have some unfinished business.  6 feet over and out

         Though many of us think of  urlLink Dwight D. Eisenhower  as the supreme commander of the Allied Forces during Dubya Dubya Too, he was actually even more fabulous than that!  He was ALSO the most influential caterer of all time!  As the head party planner for the Log Cabin Republicans, he invented the famous "Caterer's Sashay" and the "Hands on Hips disapproval code" (pictured above).  It is a little known fact that the codename "D-Day" was initially his codename for the LCR spring fling.  So when the Germans decoded all these message about the beach party happening in France, they got all excited! Imagine the looks on their faces when they found out that it was NOT the super beach party that they had been expecting!

      Jeezy Creezy, i been beezy.  Saturday, big gay parade as you know.  No pics here.  Went by myself. Sunday, dissertation crap.  Backing up stuff on DVD.  Fun all round.  Made 7 peanut butter sandwiches for... MONDAY!  Rocked.  awesome.  BOAT TRIP sans Cuba.  Animation dept went up the thames nr Windsor.  2 boats. 11 people. 100% nautarific!  Wend thru a buncha locks (even one named Boulter's lock), ate some chicken, got to captain the boat, hung with my pals, had a drink or two, and you know what... it was raaaaaad.  Thanks to the animation dept for paying for it!  And double thanks to the tutors and staff for all the beverages!  Pics will be available soon me hopes.  OHHHHHH, And I played the supermarket game with Ruth and Belle: Avocadoes, Beans, Cherries, Damsons, Eggs, Fried Corn Chips, Green bananas, Ham, Iguana Seeds, Jello, Kelp, Lemsip, Minotaur Steaks, Nicotine, Ovarian Coupons, Potato Pudding, Quahog Clams, Rescue Remedy, a Sleigh, Toothpaste, Ultimate Fighting Championship on DVD, Venereal Disease, Wrinkle Cream, Xylophone, Yasser Arafat, and Zebedee from the Magic Roundabout. Belle died round about P.  Ruth And I tied.  but kudos for her for believing that Igunana seeds and ovarian coupons existed.  Ok, on Tuesday, I went to Soho to meet the Sony team working on the getaway 2: the ps2 london gangster game.  looks like it might be real good... esp if they gimme this summer animation job.  Fingers crossed.  looks pretty cool there.  lotsa neat toys, a young crowd, and dedication to the project.  Let's hope it all turns out great.  On another note, I went to the  urlLink Formula One Protest  on regent street today.  Ecclestone is saying a london grand prix would not be too disturbing as some people claim.  Well, 500,003 people showed up, including me, Tony and Luis.  And we had to watch a tv monitor of the event from about 100 yeards away cuz the place was THAT crowded.  Also, they started an hour late and went for only 30 mins instead of 2 hours cuz London was just too crowded.  There was nooooo planning for this event excepot for some dumb ferarri tent with a line 2 blocks long.  HOWEVER, what we did see was cool.  F1 cars shooting down regent street, doing donuts and then goin back.  Cool.  Anyways, pics coming soon.  I took about 10 pictures of the back of some guys head while we were waiting for the thing to start.  Afterwards, we went to the ICA (Institute of Contemp Arts) on the mall for a drink.  There is a greasy, stargate ruler lookin scumbag bartender who works there.  If you are reading this you jerkwad, I hope you get deported back to your jerry-curl-pony-tail-punch-me-in-the-face-please side of the galaxy.  Strike 2 for the ICA.  We's hates the ICA, mastuh.

      Was gay.  And wet.  Picture drag queen with running mascara.  Fun was had by all.  Wore my kurt angle 'submit' t-shirt. Some lady came up to me and said 'ok... go on and do it then. What have i submitted to?'  I told her 'the angle lock.' confusion abounded.  Spent a lot of the day reading Lev Manovich's "The Language of New Media."  If you ever wanna read a book about how cpus and art play together without the regular claptrap of incessant sycophancy towards overrated artists, then this one is good.  So far, my only complaint is that he spends a lot of time on the easy bits, and less time on the hard bits.  makes me wanna see "Man with a movie camera" again.  Again?  not sure if i ever really saw it all the way thru.  Tonight, I went to peckham.  I took the 343 bus from london bridge.  Who's a big boy taking buses all by himself, then?  Took quite a while, but once I got to mat's house, I was all good.  Nice bit of town, too.  he has, wait for it..... a garden!  Seriously.  And I could stretch out my arms without touching the walls of the apt.  Quite amazing.  We watched 2 movies in his comfy den.  I realize that his armchair was the only comfy chair i've ever sat in in all of london, besides those at furniture stores.  i need to goto more of those.... And since it was one of those, erm, chilly July nights, we had the fire on!  It was, as tony would say, gorgeous. Or he might even go so far as to say aromatic. Seriously, that boy has like synaesthesia of the vocabulary...  I wish english people could talk as good as amerikaaans.  Mat and I watched 2 movies.  hedwig and the angry inch, and barbarian invasions.  Enjoyed both of em... but they both had their strengths and weaknesses, of course.  Just so you know, Richard Carnes, I would have a sex change for you so that we could get married and move out of East germany.  Ruff ruff ruff.  i think i would also do that for Blanka.  but I dont wanna move to brazil.  Barbarian invasion was in french... old people talked about blow jobs in subtitles.  kinda reminds me of my RCA tutorials.  Some dying guy had heroin.  There was a hot junkie chick.  And they went to america at one point to do something with like hospitals.  Dont get sick in Canada.  On another note, even though Im sending this Sunday early morning, Happy Birthday Mama!

Ok maybe that is off color.  Sorry, I fell down the stairs.  I walked into a door.  Something like that.  Happy Birthday Juan.  Weird dream last nite.  Woke up screaming. Wes tried to kill me.  I hope to have a super scary dream tonight... but i hope i wake up after i die... just to see how my dreams render death.  It;s prolly like when julie andrews ends that song "Doe a dear"  Seriously, i hope for a freaky dream tonight.  Maybe some torture and stuff.  it was a nice change waking up screaming this morning.

      No, that don't mean I love the Queen--I just use her for sex.  Seriously, though, this new dude, Reggie, who is headin Nintendo of America, is quite the dude.  I read  urlLink this speech , and immediately fell in love with this Goomba-lookin exec.  I wonder how Sony and Nintendo will fare in the next gen of handhelds...  I kinda hope there is plenty of room for em both.  But I kinda want a DS... I gotta admit... I think it's cuz Nintendo gives me the warm fuzzies (in a way that Jack Radcliffe can't... growl).    however, bein a total tech loser, the PlayStation portable does look pretty rad and seemingly pushes the boundaries in gfx n crap... but as Reggie says... didn't game gear do that too?  Yankees can expect to see this new nintendo DS this Turkeyday.  europeans can expect to see it when they go on vacation to the states or Japan.  Africa... I think you got bigger things to worry about that freakin handheld gaming.

      Or should I say Infernal Affairs 0?  Cuz it is a prequel to Infernal Affairs 1.  What the fuck, Hong Kong.  Ok, so I will first off dismiss your stupid notion that I watch too many movies.  so here goes:  *frenchman's wave* *stink of pate*  ANYWAYS, now that we got that over and done with, I will get on with my review. Infernal affairs is all about Hong Kong in its transitional period (1997 or whatever) when the Limeys had to give the place back to the Chinopolies.  There are a bunch of people who all look very similar from my standpoint cuz they're all pretty similar gangsterish people with dark eyes, dark hair, asian skin, speakin Chinese, and sittin in front of a camera that seems to be held by a guy having an epileptic fit.  having said that, I could make out 2 guys... a fat cop with bad skin who looks like one of those mexican porn stars made up to look like she's an asian porn star, and a fat gangster called sam... he looks like a fat version of the aforementioned gansters.  Oooh, there is one other guy i could consistently discern... the HEAD gangster of the Ngai family who looked like this guy Tae Hong that I knew at Harvard--he was pretty average, looking, friendly in that cocaine habit kinda way, and one time he took off his clothes in the quincy dining hall.  Everyone saw his wang (pronounced with a long A, even tho we are speakin in an asian context here)... well, the people that were close to him did.  Apparently, the guy was kinda developmentally challenged.  This is an interesting juxtaposition with your humble narrator, who has genitals that rival the Iberian Peninsula.  Yeah.    ANYWYAYS, this Ngai guy was like the old-skool hong kong crimelord even though he was a young guy... had a bit of honor n crap goin on... and this fat sam guy--you really wanted to like him but u couldnt--represented the new wave of heartless crime in a modern world.  How very topical.    Umm... so all in all, the movie was entertaining at the end when people were being killed and one guy had a big butcher's knife stickin out of his chest for some reason that i dunno.  There were a couple moles in the movie too... a cop undercover in the gangsters, and a gangster playin copper... but you didnt really know who these guys were or that they even existed until they were shot and someone said "he was a mole."    seriously... it was that well set-up.  I think the writers of the movie took as long as I do on my blog entries... and I am sure you can tell that I am soo organized when I write these things.  The 2 fat guys, cop n traid, had dinner together, too... and it made me wanna eat chinese food.  On that note... Im off to find a copy of Cheerleader Autopsy and hit the sack.  Gimme an S.  Gimme an N. Gimme a U.  Gimme 2 Fs.  What does that Spell??? SNUFF FILM!!!  No, it is not tobacconist propaganda.  Why do you read my blog?  R U in Pervatory?   OOOOOOOOOH.  One thing.  All the bears at the King's arms were singing "That's amore" when I was walkin home... hahahahaha.  Homos. :-D

      That aren't Steve Hurley and Jack Radcliffe.  First off, a computer that has 8 Opterons on the motherboard... I could prolly use the damn thing to heat the house.  This  urlLink article  suggests that maybe, just maybe, this may be, maybe, a way that AMD overtakes Apple as the leader in digital artistry.  Maybe.  The other thing is this  urlLink awesome graphics tablet .  It would be so great to able to just draw directly on the screen at a super duper high resolution.  See, tablet PCs are an interesting solution to this... BUT, when it comes to upgrading, you're gunna end up spending so much money...  I'd rather just have that sexy Wacom tablet.  Would you mind if I added a third thing in here?  Would you?  I'd like a pony.

      Ok, just to set the record straight, series 10 of Friends sucks so hard except for the episode where Ross is Fine.  I have spent the last few months watching every Friends episode in order.. even though I don't like the show THAT much.  Anyways, in series 10, they spent the whole time reminiscing, tying things up, and ending the series in a totally boring way.  In conclusion, Ross is actually kind of funny, and Rachel is ok.  The last episode should have been called "The one where Phoebe should have never been a part of the show".  Alternatively, it could have been called "The one where they all lived too close to the powerlines for 10 years..."  Anyways, ROSS AND RACHEL ARE TOGETHER NOW!  OMFG!  SOOO COOL!  IT IS SUCH A RELIEF.  THEY ARE TOTALLY MFEO.  BUT PHOEVE IS STILL RELATED TO PHYLLIS, who is an old, annoying *ahem*.  Anyways, now that I'm warmed up, I can give u my review of I, **bot.  Im sure you're thinking, OMFG Butch, what's up with the asterdicks?  Well, I can't give you a review of the whole movie cuz I fell asleep in the middle when NOTHING WAS HAPPENING.  There was a black guy called Will Smith in the movie.  He apparently is some kind of star, cuz otherwise he doesn't really do much for the movie except for show his ass in a shower scene that is totally incogruous.  Like so:  "OMFG, ROBOTS ALL AROUND US!!!!  OMFG, THEY R GOING TO KILL THAT KEWL BLACK GUY!  BANG!  SMACK! BANG!!! BANG!!! BOOM! ROBOT ROBOT!!! ROBOT GOT A GUN TO BLACK GUY'S HEAD!!!!!  WHAT WILL HAPPEN..."  *will smith's ass in the shower* or *that chick's nekkid body behind a pane of frosted glass*  VERY POSTMODERN.  There was something about 3 laws in this movie... but I really got kind of confused.  I think there was something about the constitution and how Puerto Rico is not really the 51st state.... but as I aaid, Im not sure.  There was a robot called Sunny, who was the first gay robot too.  The inventor even gave him an orifice in the back of his head filled with luminescent jelly perfect for ... well, the same as a pot-noodle, allegedly.  ALLEGEDLY!  Your humble narrator is not that much of a pervert.  Anyways, I think Sunny is gay because he has jungle fever for Will Smith...  So in this movie, a bunch of stuff doesn't happen, and then some stuff does happen, just like the trailer promises.  The camera gets flung around a bit and you get kinda dizzy.  You are entertained for a bit while people are all fighting, but the plot is pretty xparent when it comes to twists and whatnot.  The director kinda knows that you are an idiot.  Anyways, in conclusion, I kind of enjoyed the end bit.  THe robots were done quite well, and will smith really wasnt that annoying.  the futuristic vision was quite, erm, incomplete methinks.  And King Arthur was still the biggest shit sandwich ever.  FUCK THE EU!

First of all, the subject is from TEXAS not effin New England high society.  Secondly, he has realized the american dream, and is not looking for it thru yet another frickin window.  Good God Hopper.  Talk about one hit wonder....
