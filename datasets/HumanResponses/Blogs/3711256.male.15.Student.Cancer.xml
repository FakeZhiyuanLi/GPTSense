      As Sam stepped out of the oven, he felt searing pain on his back. He went to the bathroom to look in the mirror--twenty or so horizonatl lines going down his back. He thought to himself,  "I KNEW I should have taken the oven racks out first!"  Well, at least he had a healthy tan now, without UV radiation  or  having to put on sunscreen.  He made his way upstairs to watch some TV, but when he came to his destination, something  was different. Something was wrong. There was no familiar humming of his computer, and that meant only one thing-- NO POWER . He rushed over to the TV remote and pressed the power button. Nothing happened. He hit the remote as if trying to backhand tome sense into it, and tried again. Still, nothing happened.  "Okay,"  he thought.  "Don't panic, the batteries must be     ."  He took the long journey--five feet--over to the TV. Slowly, with much anticipation, he pressed the power button. Nothing. He checked the power cord. It was plugged in. He tried again, and as he expected, nothing happened. He cried to the heavens, "Dear Lord, say it isn't so!" As what he had just spoken echoed through his brain, the world around him faded into dark. He knew he should have taken his pills this morning...

      Author's note: I realize that in the last chapter I wrote in the thrid person, but I wanted to write in the first person for this chapter. You don't like it? Then LEAVE! So, I'll probably be switching perspectives throughout the writing of this "book" I've got going here.        Skin cancer: It's supposedly one of the top killers in the Pacific Northwest, but I'm not so sure. You always see these commercials about people dying from sitting out in the sun for too long, and it got me thinking...   1. What's so big about getting a tan in the sun? Couldn't I just sit in the oven for a while? It's certainly a lot safer than going out with all the UV rays and stuff. 2. Can sun-dried tomatoes get skin cancer? 3. If sun-dried tomatoes  can  get skin cancer, shouldn't we put sunscreen on them? 4. Wait, forget number 3, sun-dried tomatoes are gross, so why worry about them anyway?  As I was thinking these things, I was also laying out on the lawn in full sun. I heard the familiar creak of the screen door, and turned to see who was coming to "chat." Before I saw the person, I saw what they were carrying in their hand... BANANA BOAT!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!  It's all gooey and sticky and gross and stuff! I then looked up, horrified, into the face that greeted me. "Fred Meyer's had a sale on sunscreen, and look! It's 33% more free!" I got up and started walking towards the house. "Where are you going?"  I responded, "I'm just gonna sit in the oven for a while."

      He heard steps coming up the stairs. Loud steps. They were steps that sounded as if they didn't care what insanely early hour it was.   He looked at his clock. It was noon already?! No... He glanced at his wristwatch instead. 6:00. Early. Too early. However, it was more fitting than noon to the severe     ged feeling he had, induced by a rude awakening in the still unholy hours.   And so Sam laid in bed, waiting for sleep to return. And if sleep wasn't an option, perhaps he was just waiting for a decent hour to present himself to the world outside of his bedroom.   They say that time flies when you're having fun, so the reverse must be true for boredom. Each minute felt like at  least  15. So as Sam stared at the ceiling,  then became uncomfortable, shifted position, and stared at other various object in his room, he thought of friends, of the summer, and how it was already going by so quickly. Then he thought of how his thoughts sounded a lot like something in a bad movie... or a soap opera... or a bad movie based on a soap opera...   He glanced at his watch again. 6:01. My God, this was going to be a long morning. He closed his eyes and drifted into a restless sleep that lasted until he woke up again--at 6:05. What a way to wake up.

      Her offbeat dance makes me fantasize, (Her curves...) she's    Y! Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride, (Her ass...) she's    Y!   Alright, I was just listening to that song and thinking about that last line there. Pretty cheesy line if you ask me. I mean, a SPACESHIP? Whatever, I still practically worship Pharrell Williams and his musical skills.   So today it was just more of the usual, same stuff all over again. I think that instead of just saying what I did each day, I'm going to start writing "chapters" of a story based loosely on my life daily. This will start tomorrow. So by saying that, I guess it's no longer an idea, but a requirement. And if your name is mentioned in my story and it says you did something you didn't actually do, don't worry, it's only  LOOOSELY  based on my life. CHAPTER 1 STARTS TOMORROW!

      Sooo, I just got back from the orthodontist and got this thing on my mouth tightened, so all the teeth on the right side of my mouth are being pulled together. That's the only big thing going on right now, but enough whining!   Okay, so I was actually starting to get a pretty good tan going, but for those of you who know me, I'm very white and lose tans quickly. So for these first few days of summer, I was spending my whole day outside. Then it goes and gets cloudy, and I lose 2 weeks of sunburns in 2 days. Great.   Okay, sorry, that was more whining. So my whole thing today was just whining. Aw geez, I'm still whining! Alrighty, I'd better leave while I still have some self esteem. As before, expect more tomorrow.

      AIGHT! So it's Tuesday night, and I'm watching Last Comic Standing. My favorite guy's already been eliminated, so I guess I'm just watching it because there's nothing better to do.  If you didn't already notice, I changed my user name from Wee Laddie to Sammy Smalls. Wee Laddie (according to a source that would wish to remain anonymous) sounds possibly perverted. That thought had not yet crossed my mind, so thankyou, random person with dirty mind.  Anyways, not much has gone on today that needs talking about, so I'd best get going. Expect more tomorrow.

      Hey hey hey, this is my first post, exciting, ain't it? Yeah, I thought so. So today was okay, I had to take care of my neighbor's yard, which sucks, but the pay is great: $75 for a month of watering his grass! Amazing. So anyways, after that was all done I had Ryan over to swim, and that was fun I guess. Then I watched Bridget Jones's Diary (pretty good movie) and came up here. It's 11:30 pm and I'm tired so I'm gonna go to be now. Expect more tomorrow!
