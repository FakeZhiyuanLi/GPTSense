      Movies..... i had no idea when did i hav this passion of watching movies. i m one who would like chinese and english movies as long as they r great... not like one person who i knew..... i always hav a thing abt romantic movie.... with the lady lead always filled with the loving look on her face with all the happiness and content in her.. i like that and i feel that i always hope that i can produce that.. or i should say make my gal hav the loving look on her.. that will make me very happy and contented... thats my vision in luv. and so i will put my all in giving my luv one the best luv that i can show... to my first one...  u know, my first really real luv exp was a long one.. 3 yrs plus coming to 4...... it was a long time for a guy to commit.or i should say long for a relationship... all these days i would hav said that i really luv her and its true to the deepest of my heart... she really mattered to me.. not like those gal whom i met in my early days.... it was a coincidence that we met... we were in the same class during our 3 mths course in NYJC.... i didnt really know her much then. or i should say i dun even speak much to her.. juz that i knew her and she also abt me. results came and hers was not as expected in the language area.. and so she opted out of the JC and chose the poly life... me ... hehe stuck in there trying to get into the place i wanted to.. not until my form teacer in the 3 mth then sold me out.. without helping when he promised.. i really hate that.  but then... i got into poly after i few wks in JC.. i even bought my school U already..... my bro yeo was with me... and i opt out..  and so by coincident.... we met again in the poly... same poly and also same course ME...... thats fate.. i should say.. i didnt meet her till my final yr.. coz we were on different sides of the syllabus.. i knew she was ard and seen her a few times... her too.. but we seldom speak... she was sort of attractive then in the poly days and my frens as again speculated that i should chase her as we were really fated to be together...i resisted.. telling myself that i would not chase her and be in luv with her... in the end...... i was wrong...  we were put together in the same final year project by a mutual fren and we work out together for a yr... doing our projects... i did not hav any ideas on her then.. juz proj mates and nothing more. as time goes by.... and when it was almost time for me to graduate and go to army.. which is a daunting event in my life... i actually was very scared abt this new life.... i realise that i need someone to be there woth me and share with me my feelings... im always afraid of being lonely... and so i chased her during the study wk of my final exams. usually i studied at home for my exams... it was not until she asked me to join her and some mutual frens to the SIM library and our school too.. then we really got the chance to get together.. all our mutual frens would leave early and i would be the one staying with her and study with her till quite late.. as my hse was a long 45 min ride back which i dread the most.... long time travelling. i would hav left very early... and came back to rest... but i stayed with her at her request sometimes..  this idea of chasing her then filled my thoughts as i was studying with her. looking at her and thinking... she was quite attractive at that time.. or i should say very... i dun hav the confidence that i can do it but i still did... usually when we leave the library after our late night study.. i would wait for her bus and alight at the next few bus stop and take my bus home.... but one night... it was a memorable night for me...... i decided to give myself a try... i tried to send her back.. on her bus. we chatted for long and i purposely miss my stop and she realised it quite late and then i mention that i wanted to send her back.. i think she freak out.... she knew that i leave in yishun and dunno which bus can go back to my hse as her hse was not near MRT... luckily she got 853.. near her place and i could take it back home.. iot was a lucky shot by me... as i would not even hav the money to take a cab home. we alighted at her bus stop and she wanted to see me leave which i told her that i dun want as i wanted to send her to her doorstep... she resisted the idea and insisted of see me board my bus back home.. think she is not prepared for it then.. and so i left... watching her leave while boarding my bus.. i hope i had made my impression on her.. which i did...  and so the courting juz goes on after my exams...i was calling her and talking to her.. accompanying her ard....i knew she was adjusting.. she did not like me at all in teh first place.. she told me that.. she felt that i was ungentlement and she would not accept me as we were on a different sides in our character.... i rejected the idea thinking i can work that out.. as i was ready to change anything for her.. to change my ways.... my thinking.... and so after a few wks ..... thinking that i would not get much chance, i pop the question to her.... asking her whether i would hav a chance to be with her... she was stunned and dont know how to answer me... she wanted more time to consider and so i gave her that.. and so for a few days i pestered her on giving me an answer and finally after a few days.. she gave me an answer... on a date together.... she asked me wat no. i like.. and i answered 17... not knowing wat was going on...... actually i wanted to say 7 or 8.. but then that day was over liao.. so i chose 17.... and so she said we could start on the 17....... i was overjoyed.... and so on the 17 may 2000...... our long relationship started.... on a wrong foot thou..... 0237... late liao time to hit the bed.. will continue soon.. hope i can finish them fast..

      Well the more i think of this blog.... the more i feel that this is the only place where i can get to speak to all of u out there including myself on wat i had been thinking.. and how stupid i m in the past. and so undecisive.... it was not after recently... when i went thru..... wat i felt is the most tramatic experience for me as a person.... my failure in love life then i suddenly wake up.... all i had been doing is a dream.. which nothing had been achieved... maybe except for a few.... but then i came to a point where i was reflecting.. wat hav i learnt significantly in my past 24 yrs of life.. nothing particular.....  well the first i hope to be focusing here is abt my failures in luv that i had during my younger days..... it was so innocent, i can say...., or i should say.. i dun noe wat i m doing actually.... well u noe... i dun even noe wats luv is anyway then. juz that i wanted to experience it..... hmmm... i dun noe whether anyone of u had this feeling..... i used to hav a feeling that i might fall in luv very easily with any gal in my class and so i m very careful abt me communicating to any of them.. thats make me very distant to them.. esp gals in my class.... only a few i m quite close to.. the rest... i dun even dare to talk to them...haha sounds so childish rite... thats how sec days should be wat... full of innocence and childish.  well the first record of puppy luv.. that i can think of is quite amusing one.... it all started with rumours..... think its the eng*** who started it all... he first started the rumour that i like a gal in my class... which i dun even hav an idea of who she really is.. coz i dun talk much to her.... ya i must admit i find her quite attractive at that time... peeping on her at some times.. with the corner of my eye.. haha thats wat i know later is sie yan... quite devilish... well i dun hav any feeling for her and this eng*** juz wanted to start something and i juz dun fall for it.. i juz ignore him and i think he slowly realise that he is getting nowhere and then he shifted his target to another one.... its ..... i should say its wf. actually i also dun hav any feelings of her one.. but she and jas is sitting in front of me at that time and so i m quite clsoe to her in some ways .... always having some fun ard.. teasing each other.... anyway its all juz ordinary frenship... but then the eng*** guy did it again.... i juz ignore him again and carry on with my ordinary stuff of going to school and my eca. but the rumour juz got too intense and i think .... not confirm.. wf starting to hav some feelings for me i suppose... coz we did get along more often after the rumour started by eng.... well at that age i dun even noe wat luv all abt... i dun even hav any feelings for her... maybe i hav not 'wake up' from my childhood yet... well this goes on for quite a while but i did not warm up to her and i suppose to anyone coz i was really shy in the early sec days not outspoken enuff..(i guess thats how i develop my listening tools) and so wf was also not warmed up enuff to me and she send me a b'day card.... quite a big one.. the biggest i hav received so far.. and its still in my personal drawer.. i cant remember the details in it as i hav not looked at it for quite a while.. but then it is some well wishes and also some other stuff.... the most dramatic one i can remember is the letter she gave me... it was a letter that she was asking me to open up to her more and let her know abt me more.. think i guess she reallys hav a thing for me then.... i can see the appeal in it.... but then as always i dun noe how to react to it.. i was beginning to hav some feeling for her.. but its not really those 'deep' feelings but can be said quite superficial.... she mattered to me quite a bit.... i guess.. even now i dun really know also.... i guess she was disappointed in me afterwards.. and so i think she gave up on me... and while i thought we r in it together... i mean relationship..... she was deflected to someone else... which was juz happened to be my...... big bro in RE.. haha how ironic... he didnt know that i had a thing for her then and he was chasing her and so she was moved.. i suppose.. he did wat i could not and so she fell for him... when i knew it.... it was not really devastating.. juz that i got the feeling of being cheated.... i reacted in a childish manner... and after a day or two.. it was all over and i was back to my normal routine.... so i guess i was not prepared for this relationship thing at that time.... and all the exp was none... i did not know how to please her and how to talk to her and how to communicate to her... i do not know a lot of stuff.... i m a block.. a dumb block.... i dun know wat a gentlement is and how a gentlement behaves... so i guess thats how i lost my first, so called, 'luv'.....  i dun noe whether its right i should put it here for u all to see abt  myu own stuff.. i juz wanna record wat i can abt my past feelings to let me read it thru when i m old.. hope it is still there.... its my life exp.. my own thoughts... i m sorry if i offended anyone in this blog who i mentioned here... but then who cares.. its mine exp and i still want to leave it here.. i have tried to make it not very obvious.. only those who r in the same sec as me hav the faintest idea of wat i m mentioning abt here. its late now... gonna catch my euro last quarterfinal against czech and denmark later... hope my czech gpes thru.. see ya soon.. it will.. coz this is not the end...

      My FIRST BLOG..... hahaha very excited. after i have read kenny's blog, i realise that this is really a very good place to place my thoughts and also comunicate with my inner self. I have always not been very vocal in gatherings even with frens... coz i dun really have that much to talk and most of the time i felt that i listen more to others than talking to them. and so my thoughts r much more faster than wat i really had to interpret in speech. call it a speech barrier or some other illness... but i think i reflect more in this way and this had helped me to look at things in a more open manner and see the bigger picture in things that i felt not everyone can do. rash decisions r not my cup of tea as i do really put it into lots of thoughts before doing something or saying something important.Alrite enuff of all these crap.... now for my first really event to record here is my end of attachment after 6 long mths in my company.  Well as those who really know me, i m currently studying in the uni and doing my attachment now or over liao. today was the last day and it is suppose to be a very good and happy day. but then something dreadful had to happen in the last moment. it was abt the last 2 hrs before we r suppose to knock off and i got a call from my colleague telling me to go to the board room 2 to see boss.... my deparment manager- sup. i was surprised by that call.... i thought the company had prepared something for me in recognising my efforts to the company... FYI my suo is very impressed with my work performance in the company and he thinks very highly on me.... i was a bit happy as the com is recognising my efforts instead of my prof who promised me something but in the end nothing materialise. so i make my way to the room and there was this lady call her mdm A and the other malay guy juhari..... with my boss siting there. then this mdm A started to introduce herself and then  began to explain the situation..... in the end i was there not for wat i thought i would be getting and for a matter that had happened somewhere along this week.....   u see, my com practises this punch card system and we had to punch in and out whenever we come and leave the office. and unfortunately i was late for monday and so i called up my fren to help me punch my card and he did. this happens quite a few times as we often look after each other's back and help each other whenever anyone of us is going to be late. and so unfortunately it was discovered on the last day and they had to call me and my fren in for questioning. both of us hav to confess as the truth r there on the cards itself... anyway when i was late on mon.... my boss saw me rushing to the office with my bag...oops so obvious.... he knew abt it but then we knew he would not go to the extent of tallying our cards with our attendance.. this is supposed to be done be mdm A... so all the warnings and treatening came in and wat was funny was the malay guy actually faked himself in front of me that he was also from NTU and he was treatening me that i could fail the course in this way , which i feel is very ricdiculous... mdm A was very strict also repremanding me telling me wats wrong and wats right and trying to act friendly and wanting to understand y i did it. all i know was my boss is very disappointed in me which i felt guilty to him.. the wordings by mdm A and juhari were juz all crap to me as i dun think they really analyse the situation properly. condeming a person as he faults the first time in the comapny with a good working performance. they were saying that they would make a official complaint to the school and ask me to be prepared to face the school dean for questioning. she was asking abt my integrity and my religion ... asking me whether i m a christian.... which i think she is.... when i said no.. she gave those bemused look and thought that i dun hav one which i replied buddhism.... huh some arrogant christian here who thinks taht she is so much more superior to others. she had this really condem u look on her face which i dreads when i hav to face her and talk to her. she was telling me abt her working experience and also the ppl that she met..... and so she thinks this is a very serious matter and for me being late for 30 min and ask my fren to punch card for me..... she says this is cheating the com.... come on... this is only the 2nd time in 6 mths that i was actually late... and u know wat she does not even knows me and there she is judging me with the things i have done as if i purposely wanted to.... u know i really wanted to tell her off there asking her " ya u may hav met a lot of ppl and hav u ever met a drug sniffer.... hav u spoken heart to heart to a gangster... not ur factory worker here.. i m talking abt those youngster out there who r really drug addicts.. do u juz condem them and think they r wasted juz with one foolish act of drug sniffing." ..." Yes they might be wrong in their doings but do u hav to condem those ppl.... tell me r u a saint and who never do anything wrong.. hav u ever cheated in ur class or lie to ur parents??" .. come to the talk of this really pissed me off.. this frking bitch here trying to tell me off when wat she had seen is nothing compared to the army.... even my CO can talk to me properly before doing the punishment. she actually asking abt my integrity here... hahaha which i think do u hav one too.... who does not hav integrity... dun u ever cheat in anyway... i dun believe it.... sign... no matter wat she is juz trying to condem me and also complain to the school requesting the schooll to do some disciplinary action on me... fail me .... haha thats wat she expects... frk that bitch..  and the juhari trying to threaten me abt me failing the course and saying that he is ashamed of him being a fellow NTU grad himself when he is none. he actually say that he cannot believe wat this coming batch of NTU students will be when they grad.. citing us as the batch wwho represent the rest..... say it for himself...NUS FRKer.... i hav seen lots of more fake NUS ppl there trying to act here and there doing a lot of underhand stuff trying to be friendly to ppl when they had been scheming at the back... so does that reflects on all the NUS grds coming out... wat a childish remark from a 30 plus yr old man here... trying to act fierce and wanting to condemn me also with mdm A... i say frk that guy man... u anit seen enuff.... juz a typical simngaporean who juz work here and trying to do ur job to  impress someone hoping to climb up in ithers expense.  actually how they managed to find out abt our small tricks here is because of my other fren weihan... this is really a stupid and spoil brat which i get to know here.... he is a frker who never know his limits. he got chicken box and got mc for 2 wks..... then from then onwards.. he is like having mc now and then and sometimes not even handling up his mc to the sup.so while he is on mc... he used to ask us to punch his card for him.. this has gone on for a few mths liao and he thinks he is untouchables and keep doing this. my boss already aim him for a long time and he still dun wake up his idea.... i used to help him once but the as i see that he keeps doing this i told my fren that i m not going to do it for him liao as this is going to be out of hand and sooner or later this will be found out and indeed it happen... for this wk he was mc for 2 days... which means he work for 3 days... and u know wat.. i saw his mc and he is supposed to hav a day mc by the doc and he manipulated the mc on the spot when my boss ask it from him personally. on mon when he is on mc... my boss already knew abt it.. then on tues he do his stunt again.... thats when my boss ask my fren to give him his hp no. and i think he cannot get him.. coz the next day when he came back... my boss was asking him y he keeps getting sick. the thing is he never hands in his mc until my boss ask for it today... and thats how i saw he manipulate the mc. then i think my boss went to pass it to the admin and thats how they found out abt the discrepancies.. and mine too when he check it.. coz the timing is too nice liao.. all came in at the same time.. my fren and i Kanna big time here all becoz of one stupid guy and he is an officer mind u..... i was ashamed..... he tried to be apologetic after his questioning by the ppl there in the board rm. by then he had already  made me very disgust but i m still diplomatic to him dicussing abt the stuff with him.all i can say from the 6 mths with him i can see he is a spoil brat in one way and also fillial in another. he has this ability trying to use ppl to achieve his goal when he does not even want to do it himself.. he tried that on me but i showed him my direct disgust and my other fren was again a too nice person saying that y should i be so calculating with him... being too nice is a matter but then to those ppl like theis WH.. i dun think i should be nice to him.  in conclusion..... this IA was supposed to end in a happy note but then this event made me even more disgust abt it. i may hav to redo my IA which i dun think is a big matter to me.. i hav err and i should be brave enuff to face the consequences.. if this happens to me a few yrs ago.. i may be scared or even intimated by the juhari.. but then now i think he is not going to scare me a bit.. i m not a small kid here. so i guess this is enuff for my first entry.. very long but unfortunately this had to be my starting.. lots more coming up.. when i get the time... i will penned dwn or i should say type dwn all the thought i hav in my last 6 mths including the most controversial breakup with my 3 yr ex... which i felt i need to record it dwn somewhere... look out for it here... 0004 now logging out.........

      The last blog…. Lonely was done quite a few wks ago… I delayed it for a while….. coz I lost my interest to write then….. I had to finish them quickly as I need to post this in… which I felt in my heart is the most strongest feeling that I hav in me now….  The feeling of being down was back again… firstly, It was the email… and the letter… abt the committee of inquiry…. It was formed by the sch itself to inquire wat I had done during my IA… the lady did sent the letter to the school. I dun know how did she phrase it. But I guess I hav to answer for wat I did back then…. I was worried.. the last few wks of a mth I hav been worrying abt my IA result… I was worried that I could fail it…. Or I  would not get a gd result… this inquiry really will settle it…. I do not know whether I should pray for a pass in the subject or a gd grade in the end… firstly I should say I should pray for a pass…. But if I get a C or D for the IA, it really will not reflect the work I hav done in the com which I put in a lot of effort in the last 6 mths trying to get an A grade… I m confused… sad and worried abt it.. this will carry on till the day when the committee decides on the result…. I m also worried whether it will affect my honours also. Although I agree it was my fault in doing it and I should not be scared to face the consequences….. but……. I dun noe wat to say.. the dilemma is everywhere in my head… and heart…frens had been telling me that It should be alrite and the inquiry is juz a place for me to state my case… I dun hav any there…. Frens were consoling me but it still does not get to me.. I m still in the deep shit that I dug myself. I should say…  Juz ytd night or this early morning in the wee hrs …. I was looking at the photos that we took I mean we here is my past ex….. I was looking at them… trying to map out the things that I need to do…. I chose the songs for it.. deciding it to be a 10 min thing unless I m able to find better songs for it.. then it will be longer…. I immersed myself in it… feeling the sadness that I will feel…. When I see the photos and the music….. it tinges my mind and heart…. It makes me feel sad again…. I dun know y I keep doing this… maybe I like it or maybe I like the feeling of it…. Anyway I juz dun know…. The lost of a goal empties my heart and mind….. and sadness seeps in very quickly..  I seems to keep putting myself in it… I juz dun know why…  My state of mind is drugged… I m in a high state.. or wishing myself to be in one… I lived everyday trying to find something to do…. Even when I go out…. I m in one.. a high state… I do not want to see anyone  out there.. or talk to anyone out there…. On my route to the place where I intend to go.. I m in a high state.. immersing myself in the loud music.. bursting my ears… I m trying to keep myself in it… trying not to look at the ppl that walk pass me. I pay no attention to them. Maybe I m afraid of meeting her….. I do actually… coz I hav nothing to day to her and I juz dun wish to see her in any way.. not in my whole life I guess…. Again… I m afraid. But I still will get to meet her again tomolo where I will go to the meeting of the exchange program.. this time as seniors to help those going again.. maybe she will appear.. I dun noe. Each time I stepped out of my hse.. I would put my ipod im my ears… putting myself in a high state… not putting any notice to anyone talking to me or trying to talk to me.. I juz dun wish to…I want to go to my destination and go back….home… I will not respond to anyone… unless they touch me… or something.. grap my attention.. coz I m drugged… in a different world….. I m losing myself… losing my sanity…. I even had the idea of death…. Which I m not afraid.. even if I were to go to a war now or being held as a hostage by the terrorist.. I will not be afraid of death.. coz I had nothing.. nothing to feel for.. maybe my bros and parents will but they r not in it by then…I even had the mindset of signing on which I dreaded the most in the past… she did ask me to when I m dwn in cash.. I told her abt it but she juz dun understand..now I m considering it seriously…. Given the sanity I had now.. I would put all my energy in it and devote myself 100% in it and die in it.. not bothering abt other stuff.. even with all the ppl in there and the environment… I will fight with all I hav…. Putting myself into more misery…. I even wanted to migrate…. Leaving this country to another place where no one knows abt me…. I will work there and live myself there.. in lonely.. in sadness… I really will….. juz like the movie brotherhood…. Where jin tae lost his mind when he knew the SK commander had killed his bro jin yeok…. And he joined the communist..and fight the ppl who ordered the death of his bro… he is mad.. his sanity is gone juz like me now…. Me lost… I juz hoped I would die.. in a battle fighting for my country….. haha so funny.. u ppl might think I m siao liao…. Think it’s a deep place that I m venturing.. deeper into the darkness….. I m getting wat our defence secretary might be feeling at that time when it happen to him also… I might do wat he did………  Regards  Griffondour

      I cried........ I know that a guy would not let his tears show.... but then my eyes swell up with the little tears i hav left.,... i used to be a cry baby last time... according to my parents... and i cry a lot in my younger days.. it was a terrible childhood that i dun think any of u wanna hav... It has been  a long time ever since i cried... it was 1 or 2 yrs ago that i cried at night and could not sleep.. this is different.... it the thought of my own self that made me cried.... lonliness.... i juz realised that being me as a person will not allow me to hav a person to luv... to luv as deeply as i could... i juz realise that i will never hav the opportunity to get the person that i luv to be with me. all these thoughts really made me very very sad.... and i hav to admit that it could be a possibility to me in the near future. i m thinking in this direction now for the moment.. preparing myself for the  lonely journey of my life... i still hav my bro ard.. but they cant be ard with me for long as they hav their own gf to accompany... for me i juz gonna think of something else.  I would say the initial stages of my new relationship is very gd... i m very happy to be with her again.. to hav the opportunity to luv her again.... we went to the Sentosa in our initial stages of our luv life.. it was a very dull one... i dun hav the feeling of luv from her in her eyes. although we were bf/gf then but it was a trip that i think i would want to forget.... we took a pic then with a parrot on her head.. it was the only one that i stil hav on my small folder. i can still sense the feeling that i hav from the photo... she like to take photographs... and we took quite a lot of photos together. this is the only part of my life where i took the most photographs. soon after it was our grduation day in NP... everyone knew abt our replationship by then.. we were very happy to be together.. i can really say that i m very in luv with her.. she is the only person who can make my day juz by meeting her and talking to her. listening to her speak. i think maybe it is this luv that i hav that makes her luv me back although we had a lot of differences in our character.  Up to this point, I could not carry on wat I wanted to write in the first place… it’s the feeling that I get… I juz dun hav the inspiration to carry on wat I intended to write… I shall end it here. Waiting for my thoughts to gather again….i hav been intending to finish this thing as soon as possible but it is not easy…. Everytime I gather all my thoughts on it makes me feel very sad once I finished.. but I wanted to carry on writing…. Writing for myself.. my memories… for my shrt 3-4 yrs of my life.. I wanted to write.. but there is someone who made me stop writing… there is someone who make me leave those thoughts behind… this is someone who made me think again whether I should carry on…. But then I hate to disappoint… sorry… I need to finish this first…. I hav to put all my thoughts here… to finish wat I need to do. Thank you here for helping out of this… I appreciate that…. But I need to do this.. this is impt. To me………  Regards  Griffondour

      The topic today really struck a chord in me in a lot of ways.... i m a person who do not watch tv a lot.. even serials... i do not like to watch them, coz they took up a lot of my time and i need to chase each and every episode to get the whole picture.... i only catch a few.... as i read a phrase from a paper... "I need the newspapers because I dun watch television. I find it a waste of time - you need to turn it on a certain time to get the news, and sit through all that they want to show." This applies to serials too..  "With TV, you believe you have a choice, but in fact you don't. You structured your life around the TV rather than the other way round. Eventually, you are wasting your time because there is nothing else to do." I find this phrase rather interesting and it really describes how i feel currently abt TV program. I m not the type to chase a show juz for the sake of watching it. Maybe this is nurtured ever since young. I can be said has no childhood life at all... i juz need to know i hav to study and memorise all my time tables and many other academic stuff... if i hav nothing to do... even my mum would ask me to read the dictionary.. which i never do... Thats y i miss all those HK shows which is so popular during those times... and so i dunno know the stories of Jin Yong very well.... i did tried to catch up now.. by watching some of the recent remake of the production.... The only entertainment then for me is my comics... it is only there where i hav my childhood.. my "tong zhen" it was there where i came to know the first Jin Yong story in my life.... Tian Long Ba Bu.. it was drawn by Huang Yu Lang.. which is very popular.... i even get to watch the serial of this show acted by Huang Ri Hua as Xiao Feng.. it was the best show from wat i know for this story... and very accurate too... thks to my Sino-Singapore Undergraduate Exchange Program fren... Junkang where i to watch it.. i never forget it.... thks buddy. But sometimes i would chase some of the serial coz they r interesting and intelligent in a way the story is written... most of the shows i catch i HK production... Singapore production... its not that i do not watch them but then i feel that the way they hav been doing the shows is always revolving ard ppl to ppl relationship.. which i agree is interesting but then there is no twist to it always hanging ard the plot of rivary and revenge... whereas some hk shows not all reflect a lot on social values.... teaching moral values to ppl.. which i like a lot.... one show in particular which is having its rerun now in SCV is "Zheng Ban Qiao". its a very gd show abt this person who is a great painter of bamboos.... he is a very straight person and has great character and moral values in him... he is a person who would not bend to anything.. he live by his own morals and principles... caring for others. he is a person who will confront the government when they r abusing the folks and when he realise that he could not do that as there will always be other ppl who will be hurt from his actions, he is very sad and hated that he could not do anything to help.... i somehow feel that i have some qualities that were same as his.. but then i m not that straight as him... i m more flexible like his bamboos.... but i also do not bend to wherever the wind is blowing.. i do hav my own values.. which is the same as his and will not bend to those pressure.  Alrite... enuff of this back to the main topic..... i hav been reading this book "Pour Your Heart into it". it is a book written by the CEO of starbucks... i m not going to narrate the whole of the story but i would like to highlight the way he does his business by being ppl oriented... he is the first person which i knew.... spare my ignorance, who treats his staff very well and listen to their needs.... the way i grew up last time is more of a subordinate type... we do not ask questions, we juz follow wat is there for us... even with grievances we do not speak up as we knew nothing could be done as the top management will juz dismiss watever u said and tell u to juz do ur stuff.. they do not want comments... coz we r not in a position to know abt their priorities... Starbucks is a company who does not put a lot of emphasis on the profits... it is a company who treats their employees as the first person who will bring in the cash for the company.. they knew that these employees r the person who will shape the company, who will make the company grow... loyalty is the word.. they want all their employees to feel that the company is theirs and that makes all of them really WORK for the company.this CEO Howard Schultz, is the first person in the 90s which really acknowledge this importance and do all his best to provide the best benefits to their emplyees even the part timers. Feedback were sort of in every stores that he opened... he has a mission statement which has all his employees recognise this mission statement and will feedback to the top management whenever there is a decision made by the top management which does not reflect this mission statement... (I will write the mission statement later) sugesstions were sort of and were implemented whenever the top management feels that it is workable.he did a lot of work to convince the board abt this idea... this Starbucks is not built for profits... it is built for the passion in the coffee and the service that they wanted to provide... they hav values that govern it.... and the CEO knows that this is the best way to run the company.... the turnover rates were less than half of the industry average.. this does not stop Starbucks from being successful.. from opening shops all over the world bring the best quality coffee to the consumers. givin them the best coffee experience... All the staff in US recognise the CEO efforts and realise that the top management is willing to listen to them.. they realise that they r not working for a company.. they feel that they r working for a family.. a family of ppl who provides the best quality coffee to the ppl.... it has even made the staff to go to the union organisation in US then to state that they do not need the union to represent them as they knew that the managment is willing to listen to them and provide for them.. this is a great achievement for the company which i think is a reflection of how the employees trust the management...   The type of ppl oriented management has influence some organisation to reliase the long term benefits that it will reap. it has started to influence singapore in the recent years..... the govenment has realise this and knew that this is the way to go.. listening to the ppl. their needs.. we were governed in a very restrictive rules that do not allow speeches to be made... reflections of the government policies,,,, now they r opening up.. listening to the ppl more.... the singapore model is a different model as the starbucks one.... i believe that the public is not ready for this type of management in the early years.. it would cause a lot of problems if this type of management is not handled properly.. the new age generation of singaporeans may be ready.. but then this type of management is not having the results predicted.. it needs time.. This management style is not accepted immediately by the staff of starbucks.. it takes a lot of time to let them hav the family feel... its the same as singapore.... wat it need is time.  well this type of management is not easily applied when the top management do not realise it early. even if the dept managers realise that this is the way.. even if they wanted to apply it.... there will always be repercussion in the top management. they will put u off and think u r not following the company's mission.. which is more profits.. and more profits.... to let a company survive.. to let ppl keep their jobs is not a easy task... the management sometimes hav to make the tough decisions.. this has to be understood by the ppl itself.. this is the toughest part... to let the ppl understand the big picture.. to let them know wat all those decisions mean to them.... not easy... but Starbucks did it.... the ppl trust the management. the employees r happy with the person in charge.. the company gains the loyalty of the employees itself... this problems does not seems to appear in them... maybe they r not written in the book..... i dun noe.. this still remain a big problem for me... to let the ppl under u understand the big picture and let them know that the management is not selfish... sometimes its not the management who is selfish.. it is the ppl who is selfish.. coz the company is taking something away from them... they feel cheated.... a lot of ppl falls into this category.. they do not understand the decision.. they think the top management is no gd... they r only trying to make ur life even worse... like our government haha... the meaning behind all these decisions were not explained to them... the trust is not there... that makes me feel even more that gaining trust of ur ppl is the most impt thing in a leadership... gaining trust from ur own ppl... i tried to implement this.... i managed to gain their trust... but then the management do not recognise this.. they think u r too easily swayed by ur ppl... they think this is not the correct leadership that u r practising. sometimes its very demoralising to hear this when u hear wat u believe is not recognise by other ppl.. u know this is the way but not everyone think in the same way as u do. that is life... no matter wat i think looking at things in a broader way wil make u see more things and cover more area.. maybe not wide enuff.. but at least u r not a frog looking out from a well.... u hav tried to jump up trying to see more from the well u r binded in... u tried ways to see the vast sky... and not juz sitting at the bottom of the well looking the sky... thats wat i m trying to do... to jump up.. and jump higher...   Alrite... think this blog of mine is really too long.. i shall end all ur suffering by stating the mission statement of the Starbucks Company  STARBUCKS MISSION STATEMENT  Establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world while maintaining our uncompromising principles as we grow.The following six guiding principles will help is measure the appropriateness of our decision:  Provide a great work environment and treat each other with respect and dignity.  Embrace diversity as an essential component in the way we do business.  Apply the highest standards of excellence to teh purchasing, roasting, and fresh delivery of our coffee.  Develop enthusiatically satisfied customer all of the time.  Contribute positively to our communities and our environment.  Recognise that profitability is essential to our future success.  __________________________________________________  With that i shall leave u all for now...   Regards  GriffonDour

      i do not know how to start my blog today... as i write this i still hav a tinge of sadness in me.. i.... there is this song that i like very much..  It is amazed... by lone star... surprisingly its an english song.... there is one part....   Every little thing that you do I'm so in love with you It just keeps getting better I wanna spend the rest of my life With you by my side Forever and ever Every little thing that you do Oh, every little thing that you do Baby I'm amazed by you  i like it very much as the tune is very smoothing to me or i hav a feeling for the song.. coz it tugs a string in me and i could recall the way i felt in the beginning. the luv that was too overwhelming for me... i was really in luv... sometimes songs connect to me the most as the tune and lyrics describes the way i feel at times.. although not totally the same but at least something.... i think it do for some of u.. there is a theme song in all of us that we can relate the most. Amazed is juz one of the many...  the begining was a terrible experience for me. i hav to deal with a lot of heartbroken times and also the temperments of a lady.. of her... she told me that the first few mths will be a very testing time for us as we r trying to adjust to each other.. i m the blockheaded one who is trying to know the ways ard a women.. trying to secure the first lady in my life... i remember the first time that we went out was to a movie at plaza singapura... i forget the title liao but then.. there was the place where i m struggling very hard whether to hold her hands after the movie... it was after the movie and we were on teh escalator down... we didnt talk much and i juz hold her hand juz like every couples.... she didnt reject me.. but from her eyes i could tell that she was confused.. there was no luv in her for me in her eyes.. i could see that... but then she juz allowed me to hold her hands... i dunno y this moment is still very vivid in my mind... it is somehow encripted in it....  its was the first life to the working world after our poly... she was trying to source for scholarship for her studies and there was one company that asked her for and interview ont he scholarhip... it was a hot afternoon... and i remember that we were wondering ard the serangoon area trying to look for the comapny ASA..we almost headed the wrong direction not until she wanted to go another way and we found the company eventually... she went in for her interview and i was juz hanging ard the area waiting for her... after an hr or two she was out and the company didnt state much abt the scholarship but wanted her to work inthe company first to gain experience before they decide whether to give her the scholarship.. she agreed and soon she was working in the area for a yr and for me... i found a job with advantech after some help from agency.... she was my everything then... i wanted to meet her everyday and the feeling was very great even i can still recall it now.i would request to meet up at night and sometimes i would go all the way to her hse and meet up with her juz to hav a short chat b4 i head my way home always taking the last bus back... her hse was a long ride from my hse... i still make it... i can still recall the days we were wondering ard her housing area and strolling beside the drain.. those were the days.... as we started work..   it was not long after a mth.... i was surprised by her when she asked me whether we would be celebrating our first mth together.. and she prepared a gift for me.. which i think is my first perfume.... i was taken by surprised at first.. i didnt know that we would hav to celebrate the first mth together.. that was teh first time that she was very sad and upset.... i didnt prepare anything for her... no dinner and no gift and no flowers too.. i was there panicking and dunno wat to do.. trying to console her but then me at that time dunno noe how to.. maybe even now i also dunno how.... i tried to be there for her saying all the things i could but to no avail.. she was upset and we didnt talk that day.. she went back on her own didnt want my accompany... all those while i was afraid.. scared and sad too.. coz i dunno wat will happen next.. i dunno whether we would juz break up like that.. all those uncertainities were driving me crazy.. i tried calling her and we do talk..... after some explainings and also some request from her.. i then knew wat she wanted or should be her minimal reuest from her bf.... flowers.. nice dinner.. not those coffeshop stuff or food courts coz she is sick of that liao as she is eating that everyday... i tried to accomodate that and once in a while eat in somewhere not very expensive but then different..   not long after.. it was her b'day.... i was preparing all the stuff that she require.. a dinner and flowers and all those stuff.... me being the most stupid guy.... was actually late for her first b'day.... she was very angry then... throwing her temperment all ard.. she wanted to go back home and didnt wanted to go celebrate it with me.. nothing i could do to console her and nothing i could do to explain myself... i was late and that was it.. i was out of the way and she cannot take it. she was angry and when i wanted to give her the present she rejected it. it was a soft toy, it was a small bear.. she said that she does not like things that were not useful and soft toys were not some of the things that she like. when we alighted on her bus stop(her hse) she was crying and saying that we juz cannot be together.. i was very sad then and trying to salvage the situation but to no avail.... she went back and i was left to go back home on a sad note... we had a long silence.. i tried to call her but she does not want to listen to my calls.i was very sad.. the gal of my life.. or can be said my dreams .... my lovely and beautiful wife.. as i call her..... is going to be lost... and truly it came.. the first seperation of us came a big blow to me.... i was working and things could not be worse for me... it was stale.... everything was dull and i m juz passing each day as it comes..... i was also preparing to go to army then.. afraid of the regime in it...i talked to a lot of ppl abt it.... there was a time where dav, elaine and i were talking abt it on the badminton court.... we used to play badminton then... elaine asked me abt this matter... and she knew wat happen.. she told me that my ex... or my first.. during my sec days... is still in luv with me and waiting for me.. asking me to go for her again.... she was also willing to help me in it... i thought for a while and i told her no... i know wat i m going for and it was for my gal who i m really in luv with...  almost a wk had passed... and i was working ard her working area.... i received her sms asking me to meet up.. stating wanted to hav a chat with me... i was already heartbroken.... and she wanted to meet me to se ehow m i doing.. i agreed..... but i was thinking i juz could not change my heart and seeing her as my fren again... i met her up and we had a small chat... she was wearing the JPG perfume which i liked very much.... i really wanted to go up and hugged her there telling her how much i luv her.. but i didnt... controlling my sadness.. we had a smal chat.. she could see the sadness in me... it was a short one as my eyes were red by then with all my tears welling up .. i tried to fought back but to no avail.. she help me clean up my tears.. and i accompanied her to her bus stop.. watching her leave on her bus before going back home.... that night.. she called me and we had a chat... abt our current situation... she was confused then.... she knew we had a difference in our character and she was afraid.. i juz explained to her abt the whole situation.. and telling her that i m willing to give it a try y not she..... i sense that she does hav some feeling for me by then.. we chatted for quite a while.. all these time my father came in to hav a look and i was trying to pretend that i m talking to another gd fren,,, not showing my sadness... she broke dwn eventually... i was thinking she does have some feelings for me..... she was considering my thoughts.. and after a while we hang up... she said wanting some time to think abt it... a ray of hope for me... but then i didnt rejoice much as i knew there might be a possibility of me being rejected... so to keep my hopes low and hoping for the best.another wk has passed... and i received a call from her.... she had thought abt it and she realised that she can do it...... i was very happy then... happy that i got my wife back.. my gal who i can relate to .. my only luv in my life then.. she was too.. happy that we r together again...recalling all the temperments that i had to endure b4.. she was apologetic abt it... it was scary for me... the uncertaintity.. the fear that i had everyday... i told her abt it.. and she said that she would not do that again... she does not want me to speak of it again.. she knew that she was bad those days... i told her to juz say wat she is unhappy abt me and i would change for her.. everything.. she is my everything then... i was thinknig finally i m leaving those scary days and towards a very happy experience.. and it is....... thats the real start of our relationship... a happy and memorable one for me....

      This blog was started to keep all the things that I wanted to record….. my life.. my experiences. All the thoughts that I hav and all the things that I wanted to say in my heart….. be it those happy moments or sad…… I need inspiration…. The mood to be able to record it dwn… tonight the mood is right for it….  I dun noe y izzit that I will always record all those things that made me very sad… the mood that I seek Is saddening…. Maybe its self torturing…. I dun hav any idea… Rage… sad…. Unhappinessness…. Is all I could manage currently… some times there r stuffs that made me sad…. Lots of it…. I can say my times of happiness is only the days when I hav no blog in.like tonight I went out with a fren…. And when I came back, I hav this sad or xian feeling in me and I would more often than not  think of the rage in me.. reminding myself of the bad times that I m in.. the worse situation that I had.. like now..  I m reading this forum lately… and the topic that makes me look up to it a lot is titled Gers are still gers… inside it states all the stuff that all guys had to endure and all the troubles that they had which in a r/s or married life.. I can relate to quite a lot of them.. I do not realize that it is not only me who is facing the problem….. but a lot of guys r facing it… without realizing it…… sometimes I ask myself whether I should continue reading them coz it made me lose a lot of confidence in sing gals. The manly side of me will never allow me to be in such a weak position giving in all the times… that will make me lonely for a very long time… maybe it’s the aftermath of losing a person which I hold very dearly and learning the hard cold truth abt it. That I was never luved for the past few yrs….  That gave me a lot of motivation to do a lot of stuff… like pumping weights… running(which I dread)… a lot more to tire myself in order not to think abt them…. Frens who read my blog do gave their concerns when they see it.. I appreciate their help but then I had to say everything is fine… there r dwn days and gd days.. juz for me dwn days r a lot for the past 4 mths…. Maybe it will go on longer or it will end soon… maybe… I m not optimistic… call me a pessimist..  coz I think I m…. I think a lot.. of the long term effects… the future based on wat I m now… and I dun see the light ard… not in the distant future….   As I reflect abt how I m feeling when I broke up with my first…. I realize I m doing the same thing as before…. I develop a hatred feelings with the gals ard.. I dun want to befriend any gals for the moment… I m indulged in my music… (disc-man)…. Not until I met my recent one…. And when all things ended I m doing abt the same… the last time I took abt a yr to be able to start a new one…. I dunno how this will take me to start another.. but I guess it could be longer or never…. Coz I m not ready…. But ironically I can say that the only way I can get out of this dreaded place is for me to find a love that I can put my thoughts in…. haha so ironic…. I will not pursue any gal for a very long time.. I dun think I will… unless something really make me believe….. believe in luv again… it will be hard.. very.. but I think can be done.. I should say I m “right here waiting”, waiting for my ticket train to get outta here.. I had this song in my hp for abt a yr liao… whenever I change my hp this ring tone still remains.. I m right here waiting…. Waiting for something to get me out of this dreaded place…. Its late…. 2 plus going 3.. I guess u hav to hit the bed… and I m listening to byran adams “When you love Someone”…….. signing off….  Regards  Griffondour
