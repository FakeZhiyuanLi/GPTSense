      So, I had a meeting earlier this morning, 8 am to be exact, with the pricipal of my daughters school, the assistant principal (who will be named devil-lady from  here on), the parent-teacher coordinator, my husband Andrew (who will be named angel-fella from here on), and myself. This was all due to a complaint I made to  urlLink The board of Education in New York State . See, devil-lady humiliated angel-fella in front of my daughter, the rest of the office staff, and a few other parents. My daughter had been on the news earlier that day because she is a superstar and she was being featured doing yoga on the news, anyway, she was late getting to school and when angel-fella went in to check her in, devil-lady chewed him out and brought up everything he has ever done wrong, such as previous tardies, a forgotten permission slip, etc.. She said the my daughter was not getting her education because of angel-fella and that he should be ashamed and she was YELLING! Can you believe this. So I saw the whole thing from the street, it was like watching a play, the front doors to the school were the proscenium arch and I watched angel-fella's shoulders slump into a heap of embarrassment, while I also saw my daughters safety structure become threatened while devil-lady's flames of "I haven't been with a man in a long time and I'm just plain angry at everyone" engulf everyone around her. So, being the fiery redhead I am I stormed inside afterwards and told her I thought her behavior was completely inappropriate and that it was never acceptable to humiliate a parent in front of their child (does anyone remember that part in  urlLink AMELIE ? ok@y!) so then she gave me attitude and basically refused to apologize and said it was "policy". So I said I was going to talk to some one above her to which she replied, "who will you tell?" and I said what's your position and she said assistant principal, and I said well I'll tell the pricipal and she said, "go ahead, here's my name" now I know in a blog you can't hear how she said this but it was mean and threatening, kinda like, go ahead, I rule this place. So instead of telling the pricipal, I called the BOARD OF FREAKIN' EDUCATION! Boo-ya! And it worked, can you believe it. She had to apologize to us now and an investigation of said, "policy" is being done. And the district supervisor called me to apologize and to let angel-fella and I know that we did the right thing and that what she did WAS out of line.  thank God for the BOE! I love them  red
