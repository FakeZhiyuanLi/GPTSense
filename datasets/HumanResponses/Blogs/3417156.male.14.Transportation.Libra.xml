       I actually went last night to the Pengrowth Saddledome to watch the away game on the Jumbotron and all that. It was a total debacle. We called another staff that was there (he wasn't working) and he said it was "Sold Out". So we went down near the Anvsion Young Club and some lady told us to try a entrance above. So we went there and there was 2 Saddledome staff and they were telling everyone that the doors were locked and no one would get in. We noticed that the neglected to lock the doors to the entrance a few meters to the left and so we all bolted to the doors and got in. We ended up in the nosebleeds which were NOT sold out!!!! We almost tripped over some French TV reporter from CANAL+. Anyway it sucked cause we didn't win and while I was there we didn't score the one goal. Oh well at least I was part of the "C of Red". Anyway... Seacrest OUT!!! (Man I gotta stop using that)

       I really hope we win the Stanley Cup! I like it how when you like go to Southcentre there is like 50 Flames Flags everywhere! The huge flag at Advantage Ford is amazing. Must need a lot of wind though! I saw Shrek 2 yesterday and it was really funny. It was also really crazy too! The Coliseum was packed and the parking lot as well. Compared to last week when I went to see New York Minute with Mary-Kate & Ashley (which was a complete bomb,Don't go see it) it was like Tower Of Terror on the opening day! Anyway feel free to leave comments the three people reading this! Tiff if you read this Hope you are having a blast!

       Well my Survivor buff came! Yeah! It's around my neck right now :-). I went to Calaway Park twice this weekend! Thank goodness for season passes! I went on Saturday night for a hour (in the rain) and Sunday morning for a few hours. Let me tell you even though it was raining and a hour before park close it was still a blast! The lines were so empty! I got to go on the new ride "Chaos" 2 times in a row. Me and Jamie.M went on the log ride 2 times in a row and the rollercoaster 2 times in a row in the front seat. The rain was crazy on the turn after the drop. It was pounding into your face. I don't think I would do that again. We got drenched on the log ride. The next day we went again and Dawn, Jodie and some of the other kids went on the ferris wheel and the kid who picked it got scared and they took him off the ride but me,Dawn,and another kid were stuck on it for a long time (not due to anything). We went on the bumper boats and I was in one boat and the rest were in another one. We got pretty wet. We also went on the rollercoaster and "Chaos" again. Dawn liked it so that was better then Jaime almost throwing up :-P. We wanted to go on the log ride but the line was crazy. I am disappointed we lost the Stanley Cup but then there is next season. GREAT JOB CALGARY FLAMES WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU!!!  So I played NHL 2004 and got my revenge! We won against Tampa Bay (of all the teams that made it). The virtual one will have to do for now!

       I went to watch Game 5 at the Dome after "certain incidents" occurred during and after the last time. Me and Ryan went and we sat in the 3rd row in the LOWER BOWL!! It was so darn cool! I was on the "Live" shot of the Pengrowth Saddledome on CBC. It was a heck of a lot easier than last time because they sold tickets this time which reduced some of the headache at the doors. We got there like maybe 5 mins after doors opened and it was a breeze. The lines were crazy for snacks though. I also went to the Stamps Pre-season game on Saturday. My little cousin and me were on the Jumbotron before the game. Amanda couldn't believe it though. We were eating popcorn and cheering. :-D. It was so cute. Afterwards I went and watched the hockey game at my house and then later on we went over to our neighbours house and man we had a good time (although we lost). On Sunday I went and saw Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azakban at Paramount Chinook. It was really crazy cause of the rain and everyone wanted to stay indoors and maybe check this movie out. Dad and me got tickets to the 1:45 show (I think) and the guy said there was 138 seats left. Well... they were mostly in the front row! It was awesome though! Great movie, the director change is noticable. My cousin Victoria saw the IMAX version. I wonder what that was like? Pepsi Taste Challenge was there too. Anyway It's all or nothing tonight so GO FLAMES GO!!! Oliwa forever!!! Oh, I am now in the offical "Delivery Period" for my Survivor Buff. So I hope it comes soon. One sad note... Zip is going to be absorbed into Air Canada. No more funky coloured planes at Calgary International. I wanted to see the Zip A319 though!!! Darn... Goodbye Zip...   "Zipper 3623 You are cleared to land on Runway 36" "Zipper 3623 Cleared to land, Runway 36. Goodbye Calgary Tower"  Miss ya those big bright planes!!!!!!  PEACE! Matthew
