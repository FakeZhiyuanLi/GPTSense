      Yesterday was such an exciting day. I had bought the File of Justice V and Burning Flame II VCD sets. Currently watching Disc 5 of FOJ and I just think that Flora's acting was really good for a newcomer(at that time) and her perfomance kept improving ever since. Actually, I had watched Burning Flame II before, but at that time, I disliked Flora's character for I think she snatched someone's husband. However, I just need to have everything with Flora in it, so I bought it as a keepsake and for appreciating how beautiful Flora is in that show  .  I had also bought Flora's second album   again because the packaging is different and I can put one at my workplace and one at home.   Now, Flora totally replaces Sammi from my heart   , mind and soul. Just a mention of Flora's name or knowing that someone also likes her or acknowledges how beautiful and talented she is, is enough to make my day!!!

      I finally found Flora's 3rd album   that was released in 2002 in HMV and bought it immediately. The songs are really nice. :) I like almost all of the songs in the album.  Especially Track No.9   which is one of the themesongs in The Family Man series. A very good song.   Yesterday night, I had watched the last episode of Hard Fate. Luckily, there is a happy ending, though it can be a lot happier if Ceci did not die. Definitely not one of my favourite shows. Current favourite is The Family Man.  Three more days to Flora's birthday which is on May 30th. I wonder how she will be spending it. Any idea?

      What a big satisfaction it is to finish watching all of the Untraceable Evidence II yesterday night! :)   I will get to watch the last episode of Hard Fate tonight. Though, I had already known the ending, I just can't wait to finish watching it.   Flora had returned to Hong Kong after wrapping up the filming of 黄飞鸿与十三姨. She will take a rest before coming over to Singapore. I hope that I get to meet her when she is here!! :)

      Couldn't think of a good title at the moment. :P Too tired I guess. Had been writing my report for the whole night with only an hour of sleep before coming to *** and continue doing it. Finally finished the first draft of the report. Although tired, just don't feel like sleeping. Felt like rushing home the minute the clock turns 6 pm. :) What's the rush for? Go home and watch Untraceable Evidence II (Disc 5)!!! Hahahahahaa...   The reason why I had to stay up whole night to do the report was because I had spent the whole weekend watching Untraceable Evidence (Part I) and Flora's video clips!   Oh yes, I had taken down Sammi's poster which had previously adorned the wall in front of my desk! And guess what? I had replaced it with a photo of Flora. Flora looks really gorgeous in the photo but too bad, the photo is not as large as a poster and the wall looks kind of blank. And this means, I need to get a poster of Flora as soon as possible. Anyone who sees any shops selling Flora's poster in Singapore, please leave me a message at "Comments" or "Guessbook". I would really appreciate it. :) Thanks in advance!!

      Family Man is a great series. It is heart-warming and also funny in each and every episodes. Not to be missed for anyone who likes to watch TV. :P  And Flora is just perfect in the series; from head to toe! The hairstyle suits her really well. :D

      I am getting very addicted to Flora's TVB series. Had watched 13 episodes of Side Beat, and Disc 1-6 of Untraceable Evidence since yesterday night. Now, I feel so guilty for not writing my report. Still have only 7 pages. I need to buck up and write it quickly now. Hope everything goes smoothly. This is the time, I need to pray and get the blessings from God. And, I have faith that God will help me each and everytime. :)

      Just bought the Untraceable Evidence and Untraceable Evidence II VCD sets. Really excited about it, although I had already watched both of these shows before. Maybe when I have more free time, I will watch them again. So currently, I just keep the VCDs in a safe place.   From the free VCD interview with Flora, I got to know a little more about her. I think she is not only great in her shows but she is also a great person in real life.

      Just watched the first three episodes of the Side Beat series. It was one of Flora's old series that I had only managed to watch part of last time. This is a good series. Flora is a reporter/part-time policewoman in the show. Nice hairstyle too. :)

      Managed to buy Flora's album that was released in 2001. The songs are OK, as I think she is a better actress than a singer. However, her voice is just as nice and sexy as when she talks. In fact, I prefer her voice than Sammi's. Sammi's voice is sort of cute but Flora's is very womanly. :) Agree?

      What a day.. Still didn't manage to watch Hard Fate today. Had stopped till episode 20 since last week. But, I had read about the storyline from the TVB homepage till episode 25. Can't help feeling a bit dissapointed with how Yin Gor had turned so bad. I was hoping that this show will have a happy ending.  Time to go to sleep.. Good night..

      First noticed Flora in Untraceable Evidence. But, didn't really became a fan till now, after watching Hard Fate. Just couldn't get enough of Flora each day. Such a remarkable actress. Finally found the long awaited the polyphonic ringtone of Hard Fate themesong. Ringtone can be found in "http://loveflorachan.com", the best site dedicated to Flora Chan.   Hope all is well with Flora who is at Heng Dian filming her new series. Can't wait to watch it.. :)  Still many more of Flora's series that I haven't watch. Like the Family Man and A Case of Misadventure. Will watch them as soon as I have some free time!

         Besides watching TGUIT, I had also watched the first three episodes of  urlLink A TASTE OF LOVE . The show (especially, Flora) is so nice that I have to watch all immediately so I went to rent all of the DVD. Tonight, after watching Spider-Man 2, I will go home quickly to watch ATOL. :P  Hehe.. I went to Popular bookstore to buy something just now and it so happened that I saw some inspirational bookmarks there. Hehehe.. So I bought two; one for myself and the other for my roommate.

      This time I guessed correctly.    Sze Ching (Kou Shan's cousin sister) is actually her stepsister. Hehehe...   I hope KS will be with MS soon. They had already developed feelings for each other. It will be nice to see them go dating again because the "first date" they had was extremely funny!!!   After watching episode 9, I have decided to get a pair of shoes with shoelaces. Why? I know if I tell the reason, all of you may think I am crazy. So, I had better not tell why. But, there are two person who knows the reason (my boyfriend and my roommate). If you want to know why, you have got to watch episode 9 of TGUIT.  Again, I have got to wait till this Friday to watch episode 10-12. Seemed like these days, all I can do is wait and wait. Couldn't really concentrate on studying my GRE or doing my research work.    And I plan to watch Spiderman 2 with my boyfriend tomorrow night. I liked the first movie a lot and I thought maybe the second one will be equally good. Let's see how it is...

      I am so upset   with having to wait and wait for the next episode of TGUIT that I totally forgot to mention this here! Hahahaha..  Anyway, I had already told some friends about this.   Guess what? I had managed to collect all three of Flora's album!!!   Hehehe.. All thanks to having a great and lucky roommate!!! She found the CD in a shop near Sim Lim. I was so happy and excited when she gave it to me.        Picture is taken by Sony Ericsson T610 phone camera   To think of it, I think I was the lucky one! Why? It's because when she got home (on the night she had bought the CD), I was busy watching Flora's series (A Taste Of Love) and I didn't care much about her, even when she asked me questions regarding Flora's first album. Then, all of a sudden, she gave me the CD and said that it is my early birthday present!!   Luckily, she wasn't angry with me for not paying attention to her.

      Hehe.. I got it wrong. The rich husband did not kill his wife (the prostitute). She committed suicide. :P  Sigh, after the long wait for episode 5 & 6, I have to wait for episode 7 & 8.   The story is getting better. The preview (shown in K-100) shows that Kou Shan's mother had an affair with Hui Man Piu. And Kou Shan was crying, suspecting herself as the lovechild of her mother and HMP. But, I think this scene is just to mislead us. I think probably, Sze Ching (KS's cousin sister) is the lovechild. Hehehe... I wonder whether I had guessed correctly this time.  Kou Shan -- Flora Chan Morning Sir -- Roger Kwok

      Sigh... The videoshop told me that the 5th and 6th episode will only be here on Saturday. Had to wait again. This series so full of suspense that keeps me wanting to watch more of it! My cousin in UK is also watching it and she enjoyed the show as much as I did! :P   I really want to know the story behind that picture with the prostitute. Could it be that   is actually trying to investigate about prostitution ring? And, I think the prostitute probably snatched the bracelet from him when the photo was taken. I also suspect that the rich man (prostitute's husband) probably killed the prostitute. Hehehe.. all these are just speculation. Will have to watch the 5th episode to find out. :P

      Hehehe... I was really excited and lucky enough to find a TVB rental shop nearby. And, even luckier, they had the TGUIT series there. I immediately rented the first two episodes and went home to watch it with my roommate.   This show is really good. Flora is really cute in it, but, the only setback is her hairstyle. Although I am a crazy fan of hers, I have to tell what I really feel even though it may not be something nice about her. I don't think she looks good with short fringe. I am waiting for the later episodes, where her hair is tied up. She looks so cool with her hair tied up (from trailers and themesong).  I think this series is a lot better than Hard Fate. But we will have to see how the story goes now. :)   And just now, I had watched again the first episode with my boyfriend. Hehehee.. It is so nice that I don't think I will ever feel bored watching it. Tomorrow, I will watch the second episode again.  Now waiting excitedly for Ep. 3 & 4 which is due to arrive on Wednesday!!! :P

        This is Flora's latest series in TVB, which will be shown tonight in Hong Kong. Heard that the videos for rental will be available in Singapore and Malaysia this week too. But, I have not found any TVB video rental shops around Bukit Batok or Bukit Gombak area yet. Does anyone know? Please tell me by leaving the address at "Comments". Thanks.   Based on the trailer found in  urlLink TVBI COMPANY LIMITED , it should be an exciting and interesting series. And best of all, Flora is starring in it.   Hehehehe...

      My bf and I went to watch Around the World in 80 Days yesterday night. Quite a good movie and very funny too. I know that not everyone can tolerate Jackie Chan's movie, but it is still a good one (IMHO). :) I don't want to mention here what is funny in the movie as it would spoil all your fun watching it later. ;)  Currently, I have to prepare for GRE. I had been planning to start reading those books since last week, but I had not managed to do that because of a very obvious distraction. Hahahaa.. It is difficult to update my blog without mentioning Flora's name! :P   Without doubt, I am sure all of you guessed it correctly what the distraction is! Hehehe...

      This is a fiction written by my new friend, PH. I had read it and I think it is a great story. I will recommend it to anyone who has some spare time.       urlLink * WHO DO YOU LOVE? *   Forewords of the story: “Who Do You Love?” is a story of a girl named Flora Chan. She is a very beautiful girl, came from a rich family. Her mother died when giving birth to her and her father married another woman. She has a sister from this new mother. Her stepmother will love her and concerned over her only in front of her father but behind him, she was left unconcerned. But her father loved her dearly more than her younger sister, which make her stepmother and sister jealous over her. She is not only having beauty from the outside but also have inner beauty. She is humble and kind, which makes ALL the guys, attracted to her. With so many guys interested in her, so Who Do You Love, Flora ?

         Just finished watching Triumph in the Skies. Too bad, Vincent is not with Belle in the end. Sigh.. I don't like the ending of this show, but overall, it is a nice show.   The show just made me feel that I have to really appreciate my boyfriend even more than I do now.  All that I can ask for is that he is as romantic as Vincent **hint**

      Have been really busy for the past few days. Had watched "Triumph In The Skies" till episode 12. Flora is very beautiful in this series acting as Isabelle (Belle) and I love Belle to bits.  . I wouldn't know who to choose either if I were like Belle. But of course, my love life is not as exciting. No "love triangle". Although I should be thankful that such thing does not happen to me, I just think that it would be so much more exciting to have a love life like Belle. Hmmm.. By the way, I already knew the story and ending of this series, and I surely don't want to end up like Belle.      Two days ago, I had bought the VCD set of "A Case of Misadventure" and also Flora's first movie, "Love Au Zen". Had finished watching all these. ACOM is quite nice, very funny at certain parts. But the movie was a bit like after watching you will ask, "Huh??? Is that all?"

Too bad, I talk so loud as though I am selling something at the "pasar malam" or wet market! :D hhahaha..  Love Flora's singing more than Sammi's currently. Anyway, I was a fan of Sammi from her acting in the Journey of Love TVB series and not really someone who admire her singing skills. But, currently, I think Flora's singing is quite good.    Do vote for whomever you think is a better singer at my poll.            Who is a better singer?

      Hmmm.. Want to know what I did for the whole weekend? I stayed at home and watch Healing Hands series. To tell the truth, I think Flora's hairstyle in this series does not suit her at all. I think among all, her hairstyle in The Family Man is the best. :)   Actually, I didn't plan to watch VCD for the whole weekend. I wanted to restart studying for my GRE but just too lazy to read those books. They are not as "interesting" as watching Flora's series for the second time. Hahaha..  So I just ate, slept and watched VCD for the whole weekend. Good life, huh?

      Flora arrived yesterday morning but I didn't get to see her. Too bad that I didn't know which flight she would take. Anyway, from what I knew, her flight arrived around 11am morning. That would mean that even if I were to know which flight she took, I would not be able to be in Changi Airport to welcome her. This is because I had to be in *** to correct my report draft. :)    Anyway, as long as Flora is still in Singapore, I might just have another chance to see her. :P  Hahahaa.. My roommate and I watched "Life In Balance" (the TVB telemovie that Flora starred in) and we just criticised the movie for more than half of it! Hahahahahah.. The storyline is so predictable. And I don't think I like the character than Flora acted as.

       I am so happy today!!!!       I finally get to see Flora!!! So lucky, right?   Saw her real close at the Changi airport. Can even touch her but I dared not to.     Flora is extremely pretty!!! Prettier than any photos you can ever find because the real Flora looks a lot better. She is quite small in size, although she looked tall in the TVB series. Slightly shorter than I am. Her chin is so adorable. Sharp and cute. Nose also very pretty. Can't comment about the eyes as she had her sunglasses on. Hands are small and delicate too! (without nail polish). Very very pretty. Love her so much.

       Sigh.. I had decided not to move to the new blog in   urlLink  www.motime.com   . Because I don't find the color scheme appealing enough. I still prefer the color found here. So hope you all will continue to come and visit my blog here. ;)  &nbsp;  Yesterday, I had done quite a lot of things.  &nbsp;  First, at 1.00pm, I went to Jurong East to buy one Sammi's Singapore concert ticket from a girl, for SGD 150 for a fifth row seat. Ok, why did I buy Sammi's concert ticket? Didn't I&nbsp;abandoned her and became Flora's fan, which is the main reason why I set up this blog??? Hehe.. A few days ago, I had seen Sammi's interview and special from the net. The shows are mainly a recapitulation of her singing and acting career. I suddenly realized that Sammi had achieved so much throughout all these years and this year she is going to be 32 years old. I am worried that this might be Sammi's last concert before she retires. And, I am very sure that I will regret for the whole of my life if I didn't go and attend her last concert.  &nbsp;  I also bought the book   urlLink  Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown   . I read last week from the Straits Times, that this book is a bestseller for the past few months in Singapore and the story is quite interesting about the Catholic religion and crytology.  &nbsp;  Then after that, I went to Causeway Point to buy Flora's second album to send to a friend in Malaysia.     &nbsp;   Later, I went to Bugis to check out the place where I will be taking my GRE exam next week.     &nbsp;   When I came home in the evening, I went to have a swim.     &nbsp;   At night, I chatted on ICQ and watched the first episodes of two new TVB series;&nbsp; urlLink To Catch The Uncatchable － 棟篤神探  &nbsp;and  urlLink Twin Of Brothers － 大唐雙龍傳 . I think TCTU is very&nbsp;asinine and funny, so, I will continue to watch it. But, the TOB is abominable. I&nbsp;dislike watching&nbsp;shows where the characters have this special kungfu powers and can fly here and there. :P     &nbsp;   After that, I went to read DVC. I think the book is good. Keeps me in suspense and will want to know why such and such did this and why this happened.     &nbsp;   Sigh.. :( about the GRE. It is so boring. Till now,&nbsp;I am still stuck at word list 3. I really wonder how I could finish memorizing all 50 lists in one week!!!

      For the past two months, I had been really crazy about Flora, close to the extreme side!   A few days ago, I had a discussion with PH, who is one of the friendliest Flora fans I had known. Being a Christian, PH, had enlightened me about what are the most important things in life. Her words (through ICQ), that said, "Flora is for entertainment and God is the most important" absolutely woke me up . YES!!! That's right. Flora is  ONLY  entertainment. It is time for me to return to God.   I know that I need to have a balance in life. I had already neglected my work and studies for the past two months because of being too addicted to Flora's shows. I think it is now time for me to evaluate what is more important to me in my life.   God  definitely has to come first because without His blessings, I wouldn't be here today. In the second place, are my  family and friends , who had been here with me, supporting me throughout all these years . Needless to say,  Flora  is only at the third place.  So, am I still a fan of Flora? Yes, I am. Still a 100% fan who does not have any other favourite singers, actors, or actresses. And, I will continue to give support to all her work. ;)

      Have to study for GRE these days. I am very worried I have to retake the exam again.  Watched the TGUIT recently. I think Nicole is too evil! I don't like Nicole at all, even though Flora is acting as Nicole. Flora's acting skills are too convincing that it actually makes me hate Nicole so much!!      Flora as Nicole in TGUIT   Seeing Nicole makes me miss Kou Shan so much. Sometimes, things are better when leave unchanged...

      I was discussing with another Flora fan what gift we should get for Flora if we are able to meet her one day. At first, she suggested flowers, but we both think that flowers are not unique and it is useless. Then, I suggested that she draw a portrait for Flora. Too bad, both of us are bad in drawing. So, I said that we can explain to Flora that the portrait imitating Picasso's cubism style of art! Below is a picture of Picasso's work that I think is very FUNNY when you try to imagine Flora looking like that!!!!  Heheehehe... looks as though it is a portait of Flora picking her nose! Hahahahaa...     Dora Maar by Picasso (copied from the Internet)   Yeah, I don't know how to appreciate how "beautiful" this painting is! I really wonder why people would pay millions for such a portrait.  :P   **Please feel free to make any comments

      The story is definitely improving!     When MS was accused of stealing the stone, I really thought Hugo was the culprit! Haha.. And I was wrong. It turned out to be someone else, though I had always suspected that something is wrong with the rich widow.  Next week, MS will ask his father to prevent the accident that caused KS's disability. This means, I will get to see a super-cool Flora soon! hahaha...

      The Spider-Man 2 is really good. Everyone must go and watch it! But, of course, I think it is still not as good as TGUIT.   Ooops..  I had digressed. Hehehehee.. Maybe I should change the title of this posting! Oh, but who cares? :P  Flora's series TGUIT episode 10-12 is due to be here this afternoon. I will call the videoshop in a while to reserve a copy for me after posting this.   Really cannot wait any longer to see how the story develops into now!!! Hehehe... I will go and get it and watch it as soon as possible.

       Finished reading  Digital Fortress  yesterday night. The book is about a new encyrption algorithm, which is to be released; and with this algorithm, it will be impossible for the National Security Agency to snoop on people's email messages. The book is good but not as great as  Da Vinci Code , as there aren't enough riddles for the reader to think about. I want to read the  Angels &amp; Demons  next.  Also finished watching Family Man for the second time. Moses is so cute and funny   when he is in this show. Moses and Flora make such a good couple. I hope the rumors about them are true.          My two birthday cakes... yummy!!!    Birthday had passed long ago, but only remembered to post something here today. Better late than never.

      Had been watching Family Man again for the past few days. I just love Flora with Moses so much!!! hahahaa...Going to put this picture as the wallpaper on all of my computers.       I had made a new resolution. Today onwards until end of September, I will try not to read Flora's news or surf any of her websites so that I can concentrate on my work first. I had even cleaned the bedroom this morning (need to have a new start to everything).   Hope I will be able to keep this resolution.    Oh yes, I managed to find the  DIGITAL FORTRESS  by Dan Brown today. Going to read it soon. Hahahahaa.. I think I will like this book as much as Da Vinci Code too.

      I was chatting on ICQ with a good friend and happened to talk about my secondary school days. I recalled those funny moments that I had in school with my best friends. Till today, I had not forgotten how much fun we had in school. Going to school was the best thing for me (last time).  Thinking of how we had to "correct" the teachers when they taught us something wrong and how they couldn't answer our questions just makes me excited. Remember Cikgu Saniyah and her high heels? Hahaha..   We even had our  *secret*   rituals. I think no one other than our gang knows about this ritual that we had every week when we were in Form One. Hahhahahaha....  Such good natured fun, that we had during those days, can hardly be found now. Everyone grew up and had to learn to be mature. (Although, I still am very much the same as I was, just that I can't find other *crazy* friends who are willing to so these things with me anymore.)  And, thinking about Form One, it made me think about how I met J****a. Good news, J****a had given birth to a cute baby boy   on 26th July, 2004.      How I wish to have a time machine right now to go back   to year 1991-1996. Definitely the GOOD OL' DAYS!!!

       Ever since I finished reading   urlLink  Da Vinci Code   , I am so fascinated with Dan Brown's work that I had decided on reading all his other three novels;   urlLink  Angels & Demons   ,   urlLink  Deception Point   , and   urlLink  Digital Fortress   . Da Vinci Code is so intriguing that is just aroused my sense of curiosity in cryptology. This is such an interesting field, where words and symbols represent more than one can see with the eye.  Exploring Dan Brown's official website, I found  ambigram . Ambi means both, and gram means word. An ambigram is a word written in such a way that it is legible both rightside-up and upside-down. If you are interested in learning more about ambigrams you may visit   urlLink  John Langdon's website   . He is the man who designed the "Angels &amp; Demons" ambigram for Dan Brown.

        This is probably the first time since this year that I had every experienced life without internet for two days in a row. I felt as though I am missing out something. Luckily, I had some other interesting things to do. Yesterday, I finally bought the Family Man VCD set, which I had been eye-ing long ago. Only managed to watch till episode 6 yesterday night as we spent two hours watching the new Channel U series Witness to Prosecution II. Watching FM again, just rekindled the feeling I have for Flora.
