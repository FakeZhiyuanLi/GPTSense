      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the whole Blaine thing is over! I'm not upset because I decided not to like him anymore. He never called, never returned my calls..so I decided to stop waiting and find somone new..and that is EXACTLY what I did! I went to the rodeo on Monday night and I met the sweetest cowboy ever! His name is Jeff Alan McGlaughin. He is 19 years old and lives in Edmond...which is only about an hour away from Shawnee! We talk EVERDAY!! He is so easy to talk to! I feel more comfortable around him then I did Blaine! At the rodeo dance Jeff kissed me while we were dancing! It was great! We talked about it last night. We are probably going to end up having a relationship. I thought Blaine was a great guy and stuff and now I realize that all he wanted was a playmate..and that doesn't work for me. My mom doesn't really like the fact the Jeff is so much older then I am but she said that she would "allow" me to date him, but I cant go with him anywhere for awhile..he can come over here. lol...I dont think thats gonna happen. I'll see him when I want : ) I'm afraid to tell my dad, but I will have to soon! I dont have much else to say....  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the lake this past weekend again. I brought Ashley and Hannah with me...again. lol We had a good time! It was fun. My Aunt and cousin came down there to see us! I love them! My cousins name is Keagan....he is sooo hyper! I think he has ADHD..lol. Well, I guess I am gonna get on outta here! I will write more soon!  Love,  Kelby

           I haven't been able to post this weekend because I was gone to my lake house. I brought 2 of my very best friends, Hannah and Ashley. Michael (Ashleys boyfriend) and Blaine weren't down there this weekend so it was pretty much a girls weekend, which was awesome! We had a lot of fun! We rode in the boat a lot and we skiied..and kneeboarded. I'm tired and sore though...but it's okay! We got hit on by a few other guys but we just kinda ignore it. We missed Blaine and Mike too much. lol. Oh gosh...the day we left for the lake I was taking a shower and waiting for Ashley and Hannah to get here. Well, I left the door open so if they came they could come and tell me they were here. Well, I had the music on really loud and I couldn't hear a thing! So I got out of the shower to dry off and right as I did that Ashley walked around the corner. It was so funny! I put a towel on and Hannah took a picture of me. It was awesome! LOL      Ah, well, I'm about to ask Blaine where "we" stand. We aren't going out but we act like it. I am going to ask him what he wants out of this, where this is going to go, if he wants a relationship and other stuff like that. I dont want to scare him (lol) by being too straightforward, but I think its the only way. I really like him and he says he likes me...so we are gonna see. I dont want to just be "playmates" because I want something a little more serious..commitment. I dont want to get hurt though, so I am a little skeptical about bringing it up..but then again..I have to know. I am a very emotional person and so I will be crushed if it doesn't go well!      The IFYR starts tomorrow...well, today rather since it is 1 AM! lol . The IFYR and the International Finals Youth Rodeo! It is the biggest youth rodeo in the US...and it comes to the small city of Shawnee every year and I always go to see the hot cowboys! lol. My friend Whitnei from Tennessee is coming with me to see it this week. She came down just for that. lol. How awesome!?! I'm excited! I'm going with a lot of my friends! I go every year! Hmm, well, I dont know what else to write, so I will write more after I get back from the rodeo tonight and hopefully after I talk to Blaine!  Love, Kelby

           Well, this past weekend was 4th of July. Ah..it was great. Major party time. We went to my lake house and I brought a couple friends and my sister also brought a couple of her friends! (My sis is almost 21) She let my friends go with her and her friends to a beach party. It was great. Everyone was pretty much wasted..not that that is good..lol. I was dancing and some drunk person and accidently pushed me and I hit the prop of the boat. It hurt like hell! Ihave a little cut now. Oh, and I was dancing again and these two guys came up behind me and untied my bathing suit top! Oh..and you know what else is really weird? Coach Bennet, a Wrestling Coach (22), (I was a Mat Maid..a cheerleader for wrestling..so I know all the coaches pretty well) was there! We talked for awhile..then we both went for the same ice chest and both pulled out beers..and he laughed at me. I was like "Wow..this is really weird drinkin' around you" and he said "Ah, I'm just another guy." yeah..it was crazy!            Ah, well, there is this guy named Blaine! ~*Blaine Heath Vickman*~. 8D I love his personality...and I really like him. He has "shaggy" blonde hair and is about 5'9". I met him at the lake. We have lake house close together! We are always hanging out together every night that we are down there! I'm so happy I met him! Now, about our *first* kiss with each other. It was great. We were on my 4wheeler and Mike, Ash, and Lynz were on the golf cart and we were all going down this trail but Mike, Ash, and Lynz got scared so the drove off. Blaine and I were just sitting there and we saw that they were coming back a little later so he and I got off and went behing a huge..thing. We started throwing rocks at trees and they got scared again so they left. He and I were laughing so hard...then all of sudden..it got serious..and we were there in each others arms...and I looked in his eyes and said "Are you scared?" (because of a previous comment he made) and he said "No" and we kissed!!! 8D Ever since then it has been so awesome! That was the first *real* kiss I've ever had. I mean..I've kissed a lot of other guys...but that was only while I was intoxicated or some other stupid reason. I really felt something with this one. That all happend Memorial weekend. We've seen each other every weekend..well..except two weekends...lol. And, of course, there have been many more kisses and stuff 8D. Okay, enough about Blaine...lol 8D           I got a new bathing suit...and I was tryin to get those tan lines yesterday, so I laid out for almost 3 hours yesterday in my pool. I am sooo sunburned! It hurts! I can barely move! My tummy is the worst! WHOO!            I woke up earlier then usual today..about 10 AM. lol I'm the typical teenager! 8D I dont know what I am going to do today. Probably not much! Maybe get a tan on my back. lol..the sun...*sigh* Ah, well, I guess I better get outta here and do something constructive!  xoxo, Kelby (my nickname)
