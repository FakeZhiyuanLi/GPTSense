       I have become obsessed with this tattoo.  I have always said that I would get a tattoo when I was 25 but have never really found one that I liked so much as I like this one. I've shown it to a few friends who all think it is pretty cool, so I think I am going to take the plunge (when I get some money) and get it done.   &nbsp;  Bought the book with the picture in it as well. Can't wait till that arrives (Amazon purchase). Difficult to purchase as well as I had to do it all in french. So now I get updates on its shipment in french. But easy to translate on the net. Although it doesn't make a whole heap of sense.   Performance review at work on Monday! shitting myself. Any suggestions of how to get more money?

       I am freaken hungry. Luckily Penny is going down to get me some tucker right now. What a full on day. And looking as though it might go long into the night (working for Sharon tonight). Not really sure I have much to say on my first entry. I think I am going to have to read a couple more of other peoples blogs to know what to write in them. Or I could just go with it. Think I may just go with it.  So yeah, that's all

       Back now after my work trip away. Was pretty interesting.  Check this guy out. Hot as.  urlLink http://www.fred-deltour.com/   I just got the book of the nude french rugby team and they are fantastic. I want a rugbiers body.  Anyway not really in the tellingest of moods today. I just want to be at home and cuddle up in bed under all my doonas and blankets.

       Why is it that some people can be so nice to you and be a really good friend and then a year later they totally ignore you? I really don't get it. Like if they have a problem, just fucken tell me and don't pretend we are friends and invite me to things and then ignore me. So not cool. Anyway, it was just something that has been on my mind since this morning. Felt like I acted like a bit of a drunken fool on Saturday night, but I think I was fine and it was the other two N&N that were being the losers of the night. I did have a good night though, had a good chat to heaps of other people who are friendly and don't even know me that well. Monday morning bitch. Not a good way to start a week.  Off to Melbourne on Thursday! Not really looking forward to it though. My first ever business trip.
