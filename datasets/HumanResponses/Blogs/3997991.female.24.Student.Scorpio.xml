      Today the baby has been kicking quite a bit. I am sitting here working on the computer and I have felt SEVERAL kicks. This is the most I have ever felt. He or She is quite active in there. I wonder if it was the jelly beans I just ate!?!? It's good to feel the baby move. It's always very reassuring.   Caden is at Grandma Patty's this evening. Mommy needed a few hours to herself to get some stuff up on eBay (starting that again) and to rest a little bit. He's so active as well lately.

      Well, sleeping has officially become a pain in the...er...back...and legs. I can hardly get rest at night. It's horrible! Finally 18 weeks. Almost halfway there! I think Chris and I decided we cannot stand not knowing what sex the baby is so we will probably find out sometime after my next appointment--Aug. 16th. My doc should make me an appt. then as long as everything was okay with the AFP blood test I just took today. I have already started looking at announcements that I like and making my hospital bag checklist. It's getting exciting already!   We took Caden to get his 6 month pictures on Sunday. That was fun! He is too cute. We'll get those back Aug. 10th so everyone can enjoy them. They are really adorable. He's been pretty funny lately. He runs all around in his walker and bangs himdelf into everything! He likes to pull the kitchen towel down from the fridge or cabinet and soothe his poor gums by sticking it in his mouth. Well, what doesn't go in his mouth?!?! Everywhere we go people are enamored with him but no one as much as Mommy and Daddy!

      Hi all! We decided to do a Baby Blog to keep all updated on the new baby and Mama as well as all the awesome adventures we're having with Caden. We still do not know if we're having a baby boy or girl. We might choose to be surprised (MERRY CHRISTMAS!) but if we do find the sex out it probably won't be for a month or so. Still due New Years' Eve. I am starting to feel slight flutters...especially when I go to sleep. I've been having slight backaches and leg cramps at night, but other than that I am pretty good. Already in maternity clothes. Started showing much faster with this one! Well, check back. We'll keep you updated on all the news!  &nbsp;

      Well, had an appt. with my doctor today. Everything is going well. I gained three pounds :( but other than that I am great. Baby's heartbeat was good and I am growing just fine (a little too fine) so we are on the path towards childbirth (AGAIN! Yikes!). I FINALLY made my ultrasound appt. It's for the 26th of August at 10:30! That baby better be in the right position to tell the sex! I am so excited!  Good news: Caden's hair is already coming back. The only remnant of the horrible event left is now a slight buzzer mark above an ear (think Vanilla Ice's cool hair!). He is being a little cranky right now so I think he might be popping another tooth. He ate a few Gerber finger foods Fruit Puffs today. It wasn't the first time he had one, but the first time he put a few in his mouth and actually chomped it up rather than just sucking it and spitting it out. He's on his way!!!  I just started my Stampin Up business and am really excited about that! Email me at  urlLink Stampinupmama@msn.com  if you want to host a party and if you don't know what it is look up  urlLink www.stampinup.com . It's a lot of fun and I have so many ideas for Caden's and Our Wedding's scrapbooks. You can all be expecting to get all SU! cards and gifts from now on.  Michele--Sorry! I don't have any pictures! Can you believe that???? I was too much in shock to get the camera out, but I did remember to save some hair for his baby book. Oh well...next time. I am sure it will be just a fun filled! ;)

      Well, Caden got his first haircut yesterday, but it didn't turn out to be the joyous, memorable event we'll want to remember for years. Poor little man. I asked Chris to give him a haircut because his hair was really getting long over the ears and in the back and, of course, I didn't want my baby to have a mullet! So, Chris buzzed it! It was shorter than I had imagined (shorter than Chris had imagined, too, I think). I was so upset that I made myself sick with tears! He didn't even look like my baby! But, with time I have gotten used to it. Grandma Patty says he looks cute and it's not so bad. He is quite a baldy, though. Thank goodness hair grows back! The worst part was that he was deathly afraid of the buzzer the whole time. He cried through most of it so the haircut/buzz didn't exactly turn out perfect. I couldn't help much because I was too traumatized! I am fine now, though.  My backaches seem to be getting slightly better since I have been using more pillows and a few Tylenol every night. The baby is still kicking, but not all days are active. Sometime S/He just likes to rest. Can't wait to schedule an ultrasound on the 16th of Aug. I really want to know what this baby growing inside me is going to be!

      The past few days have been very eventful as far as feeling the baby goes. S/He has been a little soccer star in there. Once again, this baby seems to be up at night kicking away. Looks like we've got another Caden who will be up all night in the beginning. I really feel the baby when I lie down right before bed. The kicks are getting stronger everyday. So much so that I think Chris will be able to feel the baby soon. The funny thing is that the baby likes to kick when I am feeding Caden. He must feel the warmth or something. Or, they have already started fighting...Next appointment is Aug. 16th. Getting antsy to hear the sex!!! My back seems to be doing better as long as I take a warm bath and Tylenol every night.  Caden has the appetite of a bear. He eats 3 Stage 2 Gerber Jars each day and I've upped his bottle to 5 or 6 oz. along with the meal. I might need to give more when he takes just the bottle alone. He is really enjoying Peek-a-Boo and laughing. Courtney stayed with us for a few days and once she tripped as she walked by us. Caden cracked up. He's such a happy boy! He still goes EVERYWHERE in his walker. I've had to plug all outlets with safety plugs and remove several things from our cedar chest and what-not. He now gets on all fours and rocks back and forth several times. He'll be crawling in a few weeks. I think I will need to give him his first haircut soon...it's growing like crazy! I'll have to enlist daddy's help in that department.  Chris is doing well in his new job. He seems to be enjoying it. He still works nights, but we have learned to really enjoy the days together by swimming and spending time with Caden. Chris will  be 28 soon! Don't forget!!!  Well, talk to you soon! Love, us!
