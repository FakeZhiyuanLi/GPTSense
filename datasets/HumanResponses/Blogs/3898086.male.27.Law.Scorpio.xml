      I don't belive what I'm seeing.  At the top of this very blog....MY blog...in the blogspot banner ad at the top of  this  page...there's actually an ad for  a Bush/Cheney '04 merchandise site.  Can you believe this crap?!  I think he is the biggest tool on the planet...the scariest & most dangerous thing ever to hold office...and the biggest poopy-head I've ever seen.  I thought that seemed pretty clear from some of my earlier content...So how in the name of all that's holy, did a Bush ad get there?  I think I may have to boycott my own blog!  I'm sorry, I'm really upset right now and I'm thinking irrationally.  I have to go max out all my credit cards until I'm so far in debt that my grandchildren will still be paying it off, and then maybe I'll beat somebody up who didn't do anything to me yet.  See, it sounds crazy when  I  say it.

      A friend of mine has been in "a band with no name" for way too long now...and yes, that's exactly what the botards have been calling themselves (actually, "the botards" would've been a better name!).  Anyway, they're a ska band, and as anyone familiar with ska knows, the bands that perform said musical style have an affinity for adapting words to contain "ska"; An example would be "the skatalites".  Well, this is what they're going for, and they've asked me to tap into my enormous audience for some input.  Some ideas we've had:      1) The Skatologists     2) Skandalous     3) Skallywag (or The Skallywags)     4) Skatterbrain     5) The Botards (a last minute entry guys-consider it a fee for using my space.) So those are your choices.  If you've read this far, please comment and help us out.  Also, my friends and I, as a group, are a bunch of drunken idiots...so if you have a better name for a ska band, throw it at me.  I'd love to hear it.  I promise that anything anyone else comes up with will not be used by my friends or myself without the creators explicit consent.  Thank you for your help.

           I don't have a new link to connect you to right now, (which I know has been the norm, so if that's what you're looking for, sorry this time, and better luck next) but I really just wanted to spew some words of wisdom from a smart man.  (And thanks for thinking it, but alas, I am not actually all that bright.)  Anyway, here are some things to think about during this glorious time of year when our candidates act like big babies and call each other names.  1) "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them."   2) "Peace cannot be kept by force; It can only be achieved by understanding."   3) "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."   4) "Only 2 things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."        Each of these statements was originally spoken by Albert Einstein.  (Except this one, which happens to be my favorite quote ever to demonstrate quote #4. -And feel free to use your best valley-girl voice for this one.) "He's that smart guy, with the hair? that did that relative thing? and I think he did some other stuff too."  (Yes, it's a real quote...Scary.)      So please, ponder these musings and let me know what you think about any or all of them.  They sure as hell interest me because I think they each apply to the here & now.  Any interesting quotes anyone else has would also be appreciated.  OK, I gotta go kick my monkey butler now.  This damn beer he poured me has way too much foam.

      Here's the link to the greatest hair/life style that ever was.  For someone to still be sporting a mullet today takes guts.  We're talking the kind of intestinal fortitude that comes only from not giving a flying fuck what others think.  Whether you like it or not, todays mullets are heroes.  Well, not a hero like a fireman or anything, but still.... Anyway, I  enjoy  seeing a mullet; It brings a little sunshine into my otherwise dreary Albany day.   If like me, you really appreciate a finely tuned mullet, please feel free to hunt one on your own and post it in a response here.  (Can we do that? I really don't know.)   Or, just enjoy my pic & this link~~~>  urlLink MulletJunky.com   urlLink    ~~~My own mullet-hunt trophy.  If anyone knows this guy, thank him and tell him to keep fighting the good fight~~~

      The damn "blog this" button on my GoogeToolbar won't work!  Every time I click on it my whole screen just freezes and I have to use the dreaded Ctrl+Alt+Del.  Any ideas on why this is or how to fix it?  It's really putting a damper on my ability to place large numbers of useless yet highly entertaining links on my blog.  In fact, there would've been a link to my favorite mullet site here (along with an example of my own daring, mullet-hunt trophy), however, thanks to my computers inability to keep from becoming blatheringly stupid while drunk (a few too many white russians with roofie chasers I suppose), I get to rant in this space instead.  So here goes. ~Why do people feel the need to bombard my innocent machine with worms, trojans, spyware, spam, and other such tripe???  What has it ever done to you?  I mean, unless you're the RIAA, or maybe even the MPAA, you have no legitimate beef with my computer...it's never harmed you...EVER...I swear.  So on behalf of all the regular Joe 12-packs out there, I beg you: C'mon...c'moooooooon...pleeeeeease...with cherries on top?  There, now that that's been irrefutably settled, I'll return you to your regularly scheduled program already in progress.

      This is something that someone else put together, and probably something that everyone has already seen, but I still get a chuckle every time I see it.&nbsp; I still&nbsp;don't understand how&nbsp;this&nbsp;boob became our president.  urlLink    I'm frightened by the resemblance. Science should compare their brains...I'll bet there's an uncanny similarity there too.

      George W. Bush and Dick Cheney walk into a diner and grab a seat.   After the initial shock of seeing the president at the local dive wears off, the waitress composes herself and asks for their order.   George W. smiles, leans in close, and asks "honey, can I have a quickie?" Completely appalled, the waitress starts screaming about sexual harrassment, throws a glass of water in Dubya's face, and storms off. At this point, Cheney leans over and whispers, "George, it's pronounced  quiche ."

      Heh...I'm a poet and I wasn't even aware. Sorry, I'm retarded. Back to the issue at hand. This is a great place to spend some time and waste some money. If you're near Seattle, go to the actual store. Otherwise, where else can you get a Pig Catapult, an Albino Bowler Oil Painting, and a Bacon Air Freshener all in one place?!

      This is the foulest thing I've ever seen!  The wacky world of Japanese ice cream is sick & twisted!  Fried eggplant, chicken wing, and  raw horse flesh  are just a few of the presumably delectable flavors of ice cream available in Japan.  How long could it be before this stuff makes an appearance on Fear Factor?  Don't enter these sites unless you have a fairly strong stomach....Seriously.

      Why does everyone still listen to the radio (same songs 25 times a day) and buy cd's of artists who are forced upon us by the recording industry (utter crap)?  C'mon people, fight the power!

      I can't believe how unbelievably shitty today has been.  First I get woken up in the middle of the night by a drippy ceiling in my apartment.  It sucks a lot, but I think to myself, "Thank dog i'm getting my out of here and getting my own place."  Nice thought, however, I've now developed insomnia and am awake for an hour and a half when i only had the opportunity to get 4.5 hours of sleep to begin with.  So, I wake up at 6 and manage to make it through a shower without slipping & breaking my hip and I even figure out a way to brush my teeth whilst avoiding amputating my uvula with my toothbrush.  These would not normally be considered extraordinary accomplishments, but for how the rest of my day went.  Drive to work sucked...I'm driving down the street when I see 2 people  on opposite sides of the street , having what I can only assume is a very intelligent discussion about the sad state of our public schools in Albany.  That's when the one on the left throws a sneaker across the street at the one on the right.  Now, I understand that this is an acceptable, and fairly common gambit while debating an unusually formidable opponent, but why did it have to be at the exact moment I was driving by?  So short story long, the shoe hits my car, and I have strike 2 to my day.  Yeah!  It's not even 7:30 yet.  So I get to work without careening off any bridges and amazingly, without further incident.  Whew.  So I have to get into costume now that I'm at work, and I quickly realize that my requisite black shoes are still at home.  I now have three options.  1)Wear the black pumas I have on (out of the question due to ridicule & the very real threat of losing my job).  2)Use my "steel-toe-punk-show combat boots" which have been through hell & back and look every bit of it.  Or 3)Drive back home while dodging the volkswagon sized asteroids that will inevitably be falling on me if I even  think  of driving back home.  So with much ado, I choose #2.  Watch me paint the black back onto my severely battered boots with a thick magic marker!  Arts & crafts are a neato.  Next, I call my real estate agent (I'm trying to buy a house...hence the comment earlier about getting out of this dump).  Somehow, everything goes fine.  Now I'm scared.  I make an offer on a house that I  really  like a lot.  It's as much as I can afford, but I offer $5000 more than list price, which along with my pre-qualification letter from the bank, makes me feel as if I'm in a very strong position.  more on this later.  So lunch is over and work is in full swing, and it continues to swing for 2 & a half hours past when I was supposed to go home.  I think that may be like strike 37 at this point.  Basically a zero star day for me.  Do horoscopes go into "negative stars"?  Anyway, pretty much as soon as I get to leave work, my phone rings...it's my agent telling me that I got out-bid on the house.  Ugh...crushing blow...wind knocked out of me...too much crap for one day.  Then she says, "But they said you came in second."  Knock out punch.  I'm down. I'm out.  I drive home in a daze.  Don't really know how I get here, but somehow....here I am.  I'm going to go curl up fetal style and hope a tsunami doesn't strike.  It'll be midnight soon enough, and a whole new day will be upon me.  Hopefully I won't wake to find rabid monkeys somehow crashed through my windows and drank all my beer, cuz  that  would be a bad day.

      First off, I gotta say I love the whole AtomFilms site, so be sure to browse around...There's hours of fun to be had.  However, I must say that the little film/song parody this link will take you to is  particularly  hilarious beacause it jives so perfectly with my disillusionment of late.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.~~~> urlLink Atomfilms~This Land  Peace out y'all.
