      Things are looking good so far. Jason sent me the request an I've added myself to the list. This is really just a test message to see if I can actually post an update and it seems to be working.  Johnny, If I can figure it out, man i know you can! :)  As for the rest of you, get signed up! This actually looks like an interesting way of keeping updated on GPL work that everyone is doing outside the forum.  I feel like some teen girl on AOL... - "L1k3, C1ndy, OMG 1m BL0GG1ng!!!1111oneone"

      After a superb first crack at making a GPL movie, Johnny X has applied everything he learned during movie #1 to his new movie. Currently untitled, almost 2 mins is complete and looks sensational. Very much like GXTrackers style of movie making but with that Johnny X flair. Lots of fast paced action and supreme synching of the clips to the music will make this movie a 'must watch'. Now we sit and wait :)

      Steve 'GXTracker' Wilton has once again made another master piece. Here's what he had to say when he released it.      The movie is based on my "learning process" of the Isle of Man Track by Jim Pearson. Consider this my tribute to such a wonderful track - one that shows off how far GPL can really go in terms of image quality.  The movie is filled with mainly AI driving, but there are online clips as well. One reason I stay away from online clips is that the warp effect really distracts from the goal of my projects IMHO.  Don't expect any fancy special effects, or engaging storyline - you can look at the other movie gurus for that kind of inspiration.   Enjoy, and like always - questions/comments/thoughts/opinions are always welcome.     Get the movie here http://jason.speedgeezers.com/btsgpl.zip

      I seem to have broken GPL. Either XP SP2 or the new ATI 4.7 drivers won't allow GPL to run anymore. Maybe with the knowledge here and at RSC (when the forums are fixed) I can get it running again. What is happening is I see the splash screen for a split second and then nothing, back to the desktop. Until I get this worked out, Blue Harvest is on hold.   Comet

      Hi all. It's me Biek ;-) I thought it was appropriate to give you guys a heads-up on who I am and what I'm doing here as I don't suspect anyone knows me or my alter ego Otto Verstear.  I'm a fellow Blogger & GPL driver and came across this GPL Movie Blogger. Now my first impression was 'wow cool, great idea' the one that followed was 'man, they can use a bit of spice on this Blogger'.  So I contacted Jason, explained to him that I'm one of the biggest fans of all GPL movies around and offered my help in making this Blogger look a bit more GPL-ish. He gladly accepted so here I am. As I will only be messing with the way things look, all data will at any time be available to everyone. It may just look a little different from time to time when I try things out.  Please feel free to send me any comments or suggestions you might have at  urlLink Overstear@gmail.com . Together we'll make it a nice one I'm sure.

      Hi guys...  So...I have 2 small problems. I've mentioned them already in rsc, but if this is a GPL Movie Blog I think I should make use of it. So the first problem concerns my movie.   Some scenes are extremely stuttering, especially during some slow cam movements. I don't know whether this is normal or not.  Here are my Settings:  Direct Capture 36 fps  Avi Compression: XviD MPEG-4 Codec Encoding Mode: 1 Pass - CBR Bitrate: 8000 kbps  Transcode Settings: Max Kbps: 2693 Frame Rate: 30 fps Encoding Passes: ONE Bitrate Mode: Constant  Gfx Card: Geforce 4 MX 460 P4 2000 Mhz 256 DDR RAM   Next problem deals with my www server. Since the release more than 100 people downloaded my movie. If the traffic rate will rise above 10 gb the server will stop the traffic completely. I won't have any email access til the next month. I will wait and watch cause right now I can't calculate the total downloads. If neccessary I will have to put the movie offline if no one can put it on it's server temporary.  Thx for your help in advance and sorry because of my weak english...I'm an 18 year old school englisch s**** :)  greets arek
