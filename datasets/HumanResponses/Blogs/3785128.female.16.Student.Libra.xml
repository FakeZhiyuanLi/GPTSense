						   he plays with my heart. he knows how i feel about him and exactly what to do to mess with my emotions. i used to think he just didnt know my name but how could he not. ive never heard him say it. then he would have to aknowledge my existance which would sent massive amounts of joy shooting through my body. making me happy is just not something he can do. he does look at me but only because he knows my eyes lock on him the second he enters the room. like a sixth sence he feels my eyes on him and looks back at me as if to say "i know you like me and just cant take your eyes off me." there was one time he smiled at me. i remember it because it is the only time he ever looked at me like i was a person not just a waste of him time. he was laughing at himselft and i was laughing right with him. our eyes met and for the first time ever i didnt look away. i gazed into his eyes loveing the expression filled with happiness on both our faces. i was jolted out of what now feels like a dream by somone yelling my name across the gym. i remember looking back at him longing for his eyes to still be there waiting for me, but they werent. the moment had passed and i was once again invisible. he knows what to do to make me thinkg he likes me and counters it with actions leaving me with doubt. i seriously think its all in my head. hejust lives his life day to day just how i should. for that breif moment though i felt like i was a part of his life. maybe it was his way of telling me his feelings or just another game. he always keeps me guessing. its so hard not to love him.

						   never give up if you still wanna try  never wipe your tears if you still wanna cry  never settle for an answer if you still wanna know  never say you dont love him if you cant let him go  &nbsp;  why cant i let you go. i dont know you like i think i do. you dont know me at all. i want you to be perfect. i&nbsp;put you on a pedestal where in my eyes you can do no wrong. im not falling in love with you. im falling in love with who i want you to be. i want the instant satisfaction. i dont want to keep looking for the rest of my life. i want my soulmate to be you, my search to me over so i can finally be happy. why cant you just be that person? its a lot easier to dream about someone when they have a face and anme not just a presence.&nbsp;you have the power to make all my dreams reality. but to do that you would have to change who you really are to make me happy. it would be selfish of me to ask that of you when somewhere out there you havea&nbsp; soulmate too. but maybe i can use your face and name for the man in my dreams just until i find someone new to take your place.ill claim he is your invisible twin in a secret dimencions and never get the real you confused with who i wish you were. unless of coarse someday down the road you show me i was never wrong about you. if that day comes i want you to know i love you, now and forever.

						   ive tried to move on. i really have. found other guys to take your place. i tell everyone ive finally moved on and you are no longer a part of my life but its a lie. i can claim its your new haircut or a shirt you just got that pulled me back to you but its not. likin gyou has just always felt so right. i can honestly say ive never felt this way about anyone before. everyone else has just seemed perfect but for me to look at you,&nbsp;see all your flaws and still feel so stronglyis a strange ne experience for me. i feel&nbsp;like we would be good for each other. in the areas that i lack you make up for it. you always make me laugh. youre always doing stupid little things that many see as dumb and immature but i just see as hillarious. i hate how you try so hard to impres everyoen and mold yourself to fit in. i think it would be different with me. i already like you for who you are, youd dont have to impress me. you dont have to change yourself to make me happy. i like you just the way you are. &nbsp; i have this dream of curling up on a couch with you, watching movies, and falling asleep in your arms. its hard for me to picture anyone else but you with me . me with you just feels right. there is no other way to explain it. you are the one ive been waiting for, the one that makes me complete. i just really wish you knew.

						   im scared, really really scared. another day, another year completely over. my pst is full of regrets, things i wish i would have done. im afraid to look ahead, afraid to keep moving forward. i dont know what the future holds for me, what choices lie ahead. there is no garentee that given the opprotunity i will act, do waht my heart desires. with all of society staring upon me waiting for me to choose, waiting for me to make a mistake. i can not avoid the inevitable. given the choice to stand out, be in the spotlight, all eyes on me, i will run for cover in the safety of the crowd. i can not be an individual standing among the crowd, can not be who i want to be if i fear what others think and the intence heat of the spotlight. looking back and seeing my mistakes is the esy part. i must not only see but learn. at this moment i picture myself standing in a path deep in the unknown of a forest. in the same situation robert frost knows so well. in my case there appears to be only one choice, follow the path ahead, for you can never go back. i stop for awhile. others pass me by seeing only the obvious. i look down the path my peers have just walked down to see them conforming to society, being molded into the stereotype everybody wants them to be. for me to move forward would be suicide for my heart. it takes sacrafice to be part of the crowd. you give up your heart, opinions, free will and ideas and in return you get the security and companionship of the people who made the same choices as you did. there is saftey in numbers and everybody knows it.  &nbsp; taking a break from life i sit down and study the footprints that are not only my own but millions of others. they have no distinct unusual markings that would lead you to think they belonged to one specific person. the path ahead is worn with the same lifeless prints. i know what i want to do, finally hearing waht my heart is saying. i take a deep breath realizing just waht this choice means. i leave behind my past now seeing it is just that, my past. it is no longer important in any way. i walk into the deep dark unknown of the forest. i am alone now and will be forever. sure there will be other individuals wander their own unique paths&nbsp;that will cross paths with me and have a path that follows along side mine. but they will not walk on path path, clutter it with their footprints.  &nbsp; you always have the opprotunity to choose even when there seems to be only one path. when give the choice to follow the crowds, keep moving forward on the only path ive ever known, i choose a path all my own. i can not go back and change my past but as i move forward my head is filled with anxiety. i do not know what is in my future and nobody can tell me, for this path is all my own. i smile looking down and seeing footprints, footprints that could not be mistaken for anyone else's but mine.

						   i want someone to write a&nbsp;love song&nbsp;to&nbsp;me. something that i can just listen to and feel their presence. it would be like he was confessing his love for me to the world but only we would know it. anytime someone would say they liked thta song it would be like them recongnizing the intense love he has for me. just to have a guy who will take the time to put his feelings into words and then write beautiful music to go along with it. i just want to hear the words and have the whole world dissappear leaving only me and him to enjoy the product of our love. i will know he is perfect if he writes me a love song.

						   something is missing in my life. i dont know what it is or where to find it but i know i wont be happy until i do. its like walking around and only hearing a flip. i need my flop to feel complete. or like going to mcdonalds and only ordering a chocolate milkeshake without french fries to dip in it. i want the saltiness that is in prefect contrast to my sweet. life just doesnt fel right without it. i always worry what will happen if i die before i complete my task. will i get another chance or does God just say tough luck move on? i really dont want to find out. i want to find that special somone who is out there just for me. the kind of person who wishes on stars and honestly believes in love at first sight. to find that one person&nbsp;who makes me complete. the guy that loves to play in the rain and watch lightning in the sky. the guy out there just for me&nbsp;doesnt care how cold it gets he just love to see the snow falling from the sky. hell be the one that falls in love with every little quirk i have and have a unique quirkiness of his own. hell be the one who reads this and laughs&nbsp;because he knows exactly what im talking about. a true dreamer to make my dreams come true.

						   you are perfect for me, because you are who ever i want you to be. the interviews gave me your general personality and i molded it into who i wanted you to be. the ultimate romantic with a love for every kind of music there is. you are not here to bring me out my fantasy where we live happily ever after. with just a look in your eyes&nbsp;or a glimce of your face reality is gone. i love to dream about how our life together will be, how complete i will fell being in your arms. my heart is telling me youre the one and when my heart is telling me something i so desperately want to believe there is no rational thinking anywhere inside me. in my dreams you are perfect for me because i need someone to play that role. i need someone, someone who cant tell me im wrong. you are perfect, perfect for my dreams. real life is another thing entirely.

						   i just want to run, run away from it all. leave behind my pain and problems and just start over. i want to run never having to stop. i want the strength to run until when i look back i dont see my past. i want to start my life over. i want a second chance where i can be the person ive always wanted to be but have always cared to much about what other people think to actually do . for so many years my whole life has been an act. it is just another role, not who i really am, not who i want to be. i want to leave behind everybody in this improvised play i call my life. i want to run. i dont know where im going but i have to go. i want to sweat away all my problems and leave them behind as drips on the sidewalk. start over in a new place where people dont know me or my past. i cant change the way my life was but i can change how the rest of my life will be. &nbsp;

						   i miss him, miss the relationship we never had. i dont fell anything. you dont know how badly i want it all just to go back to normal. im lost without him. everything was so simple. i knew where my life was going. ive moved on and now everything is new, confusing, complex. i regret so much. i regret never talking to him, never telling him how i felt. i took those fellings for granted. i mess them, i need them. they fueled my heart and soul. ive depended on them for so long i forget how to live without them. when i see him again ill look into his eyes and see a different person. ill search for those fellings, digging deep in his eyes to find the same sparkle that sent chills through my body, only to be left empty handed. i can not go back. he is a part of my past. ive stuggled many times to pt him there but was never able to leave him. now, now when i want to see his face everytime i close my eyes there is nothing. i long for that part of my life back. the naive part of me that got lost in his eyes, hypnotized by his voice, and stunned by his presence. that part of me that knew without a doubt he was perfect and someday he would sweep me of my feet and we would live happily ever after. life is not a fairytale. i was immature to think it ever could be. but i want just a little bit of that naive immaturity back. so i can have hope. hope that i didnt ruin my only chance at love. i want to have hope that there is another person that will make me feel the way he did.

						   starlight starbright, first star i see tonight, i wish i may, i wish i might, have this wish i wish tonight.  i wish i could be in love. i wnat my soulmate to be lying next to me as i wake up for the rest of my life. i dont want to cry myself to sleep every night because it hurts so bad not to have someone to share my life with. i dont care what he looks like, if hes rich or stuggling to get by. i know our love for each other will get us through any problems we have. so now as i lie here staring up at the midnight sky, im wondering how im going to do this by myself. how am i going to gather the strength of two people so i can handle the day to day reminder that i am alone, that there may not even be somoene out there for me. i can drownd myself with optomistic thoughts and drems of my soulmate but at the end of the day im still alone with no real proof true love even exists. i love to think we are both looking up at the same stars wishing for each other. i love to think hes real,that guy that occupies so much of my time because i cant stop thinking about him, i cant stop dreaming.  you only get one wish every night. one chance to pleed your case and convice the stars just how badly you need whatever it is you are wishing for. i change my wish. im not going to wish for him. i wish....i wish ifor the stength to live without him.......just incase he isnt real. i want to prove to myself i am a strong independent person. when that is true than i want to be rewarded with my love that i know is out ther wishing he could hold me in his arms and start each day with a look in my eyes.

						   the tears burn. usually i feel liberated but now it just hurts. i wipe them away only for them to return instants later. i am not as strong as i appear to be, not as strong as i wish i were. im reminded of the past. the painful past that has left me scarred. its hard to go a day without being reminded. little things push me back to that wreched april morning. april will never be the same. my life will never be the same. its scary to think one person can affect someones life so negitively. i try to think im not the only one, i know im not the only one. it is supposed to help when you talk about it. how can i talk if the very thought sends me back there. the tears clog my throat. i cry so hard i cant talk. no matter how much i want it, my life can never go back to the way it was before that horrid morning on april 28 2002.

      what if somebody read all the things i write down, all the feelings im too afraid to share? it would be like opening a book of my soul for anyone to read. my life would shatter with over exposure. thats why i write stuff down in the first place. its my way of expressing my emotions without actually talking to someone. ive been avoiding emotional contact with people since the great depression of my seventh grade life. it seemed like talking to people who could not handle the complexity of my existence only made things worse. nobody my age was going throught what i was so they didnt understand. soon it felt like no one cared and i was left alone in the dark with more emotional baggage than any one person can carry. instead of continuing the meaningless search for understanding i picked up a pencil and started writing. i poured my life, heart and sould on to that paper until it began to drip with emotion. the words seemed to flow like they had been sitting in my head waiting for their turn to meet the world. the product was more dark and depressing than i ever could have imagined yet the process was liberating. with a new found veiw of life i could not bear to red the passage i had just slaved over for fear of it consuming me once again. i tore my masterpeice into peices so tiny you could not make out the word any more. little did i know i would continue the process of writing down my emotions realizing i was the only one always willing to listen. i unpacked my baggage one bag at a time drenching my pages never ment to be seen by anone else's eyes. i dont konw when i stopped destroying them and stared storing them in one of the shoe boxes in my collection. when i read some of my early works, finally being strong enough that they dont affect me any more, they are filled with hatred and sorrow. comparing them to the many pages i have recently filled i can tell how much ive grown and how much they have helped me. i didnt need anyone to help me back on me feet, i could do it all on my own. there are no dates or times writen on my pages, few names used. those things arent important. it doesnt matter when it was written or who about, all that matters is that i wrote it, and those emotions are not longer swimming around in my head ready to explode. i have a lifetime of events and emotions writen out so i can remember every moment. that is a lot better than any picture, even if they are worth a thousand words.

      i love my tea. everything about it is perfect. the quirky joy that comes over just by hearing the light wistle of the kettle. the sweet aroma that fills the air and surrounds my body as i fill the cup. i close my eyes and just absorbe the sounds and smells of that moment in order to preserve it for all time knowing very well that the memory can never compare to the actual experience. i lift the spoon out of the cup to see the steam it is giving off ripple out into nothingness. the spoon feels the same warmth as i feel throughout my whole body before i even take my first sip. even the pain is wonderful. the pain of that first sip that you can feel burn all the way down doing the worst damage on its first victim, my unsuspecting tounge. it leaves my tounge feeling raw and scarred that is present even hours after the cup is gone. it stays as a reminder, a reminder that i was happy. a reminder that it is capable for me to experience joy that is not faked or forced out but occurs naturally.  if only i could find someone that could make me as happy as a simple cup of tea. true love is like my beloved tea. you know it is true love when even the pain fills you with joy. im currently sixteen years old and am suffering from discovering love at an early age. i am a self proclaimed hopeless romantic and have known it for as long as i can remember. i wish on the stars every night to find that one person i know is out there somewhere just for me. my daydreams are filled with thought of him, whoever he maybe. i fill in the blank image with the current object of my affection and just give him the personality i know my soulmate will have. he may look like elijah wood, clay aiken, justin timberlake, or even mike but he is the same person on the inside. the same person i made up in my head that wishes on stars for love and cries during romantic movies praying desperately for the love the characters on screen seem to have already found. when im lying awake at night staring up into the twinkling sky i try to imagine him doing the exact same. both of us drifting off into a dream land where we are together and forever longing for the warmth of each others bodies to be there as we depart from reality. its hard to dream of falling asleep with someone you love being there, arms wrapped around you, holding you close without someone actually being there. dreaming doesnt give you the same feeling. love is all about the little things. falling asleep next to each other, hands that just seem to fit together, being by their side never wanting to leave, knowing what ever problems you face your love for one another will be strong enough to get through anything. it is hard to have faith in things like that. hard to tell if your love can actually get you through the problems or if the problems are there to tell you your just kidding yourself, there is no love in this relationship. that has to be the hardest part. knowing if it is real or just something you've wanted so long so badly that your making it all up because you fear having to still search for that someone that you thought you have already found. in relationships the most important thing is faith. it is also the most difficult. i need love so bad i fall for so many people and convince myself that they are my soulmate. i just want to stop searching. i want to know he is out there and not just a figment of my imagination. even for a dreamer the pain of being alone can be so unbearable. i begin to doubt my whole way of life. i am not a patient person when it comes to my own emotions. i have found no evidence that true love even exists. with the divorce rate increasing and every relationship around me falling apart the only thing that keeps me believing is the fact that my heart controls my whole body. my heart tells me there is someone so i believe there is someone. i cant wait to experience the simple joys of being in love with someone and knowing they feel the same way about me as i feel about them. believe it or not love is not about sex. i have made the decision to wait until after marriage to have sex. nobody seems to have faith in me but i know i can do it. i want to save a part of me for just that person. like a prize they are rewarded with for finding me. i want him to be the one and only. sex is about love and the passion of the moment. if you dont know you truely love that person sex isnt the same. sex is the ultimate expression of love. you cant have sex without love. thats just the way it is. love is undeniable the greatest thing in the world. i cant wait to experience everything about it. even if my heart is torn out and broken into microscopic peices a billion times. if that is what it takes to find my one true love then i will do it. i will do what ever it takes to find him where ever he may be.

      im a dreamer. since everyone is so ready to put each and every person they meet into some catagory i thought i would  make it easy for you and just go out and say it.that is the only word that can completely describe me. sometimes i dont care what im doing i just want to stop and stare off into space so i can just day dream. i just start thinking about how i wish my life was and that sorta sets me off into this world where everything ive ever wanted to happen does. not being connected to reality constantly really doesnt make you a dreamer. you have to believe that those dreams are actually going to happen. that wishing on the stars is going to solve all your problems. i use the word think too much. i just think to much. i live my life in my head. i could spend hours just lying in my bed with my eyes closed completely out of touch with reality. if i had the choice that would be my whole life. i could just skip around to the good parts and run them over and over again in my head changing little details to make it absolutely perfect. i get into these moods where thats all i want to do. im not depressed. atleast i think im not depressed. i think i was born too late. i should be older. i want to be older. i want to meet people like me and not be stuck in a school where i have to pretend to be someone else because if i was who i wanted to be i would be alone and then i would definetly be depressed. so i dream. thats my thing. everyone has a thing. it might be art or music or some other crap that you think your good at even if it is exactly your fortay. its not a matter of being good at it. its a passion. you are just born with it. you have to discover it for yourself. something you love to do wether your good at it or fail miserably. you do it not because your good at it but because of the passion and happiness you get from just the thought of pursuing the act of whatever your passion is. to the world my passion is music. i love music, everything about it. singing, dancing, or just listening to the beat of the bass and feeling the vibrations of the sound against my body. my true passion. well my true passion it is not. i wish oh how i wish it was. it is so easy just to say music is my thing because it is something so easy to learn and so widely accepted. most passions you have to be born with the talent. with music you can learn. sure you are born with the passion for it but you learn to do it. i know what my true passion is. in a way i am one of the lucky ones. i know what i should be doing for the rest of my life but i dont know if i want to be doing it. it doesnt make sence but it does all at the same time. in my head it is crystal clear. when i say it, write it, it isnt so clear. when its in my head i dont feel like i have to explain it, it just is. when it is out there for anyone with in earshot to know it is a completely different thought. nobody seems to understand. they dont just know, i just know. why cant everyone else just know. i dont want to have to explain myself to everybody that thinks they want to be a part of my life until it gets too hard or complicated then bails out. they dont understand how my mind works. they want logic and long explanations about things i just cant explain. somethings just are the way they are. this whole modern day life is all about technology that in some way shape or form can explain ever thing simple enough for even the most primitive species to comprehend. somethings just are. there is no why or how it just is. if you can believe that you can be my friend, a part of my life that just is. if you cant, then just keep walking. forget i said anything.

      im a dreamer. that is the only word that can completely describe me. sometimes i dont care what im doing i just want to stop and stare off into space so i can just day dream. i just start thinking about how i wish my life was and that sorta sets me off into this world where everything ive ever wanted to happen does. not being connected to reality constantly really doesnt make you a dreamer. you have to believe that those dreams are actually going to happen. that wishing on the stars is going to solve all your problems. it is so far fetched that sometimes i feel like a complete moron. i swear daydream believer was writen about me. there are so many days that im just not happy with where my life is taking me so i want to lay in bed all day and just act out my perfect day in my head. as soon as i close my eyes i just start to drift and there is no possible way to pull me back. i have to do it on my own. sometimes thats the hardest part, the most depressing part. its like the perfect place to be and i have to leave. the one place where i can be myself and all my insecurities fade away and i have to walk out that door back into reality. i think thats why i love to sleep. sleeping is my favorite past time. if i could just lie in bed and sleep all day it would be perfect. but of coarse that is impossible. my mom worries about my sister being depressed enough i dont want her to add me to her list of things to deal with.   john mayer is the best person to daydream to. when im listening to his voice it is impossible not to. even when i was watching one of his concerts on vh1 tonight i could just feel myself losing touch with the world. suddenly i just felt like i was right there in front of him passionately listening to every word. he is a musical guinius. i wish someday i could be as great as him. he just has this power with words. he knows exactly what to say just to put me in aww, make me completely speechless. he never says too much or too little and you always understand exactly what he's saying. i want to be like that. i want to be a great writer.   my current daydream is of me sitting on stage giving a completely sold out concert. it is the time for my very last song and i bring out a guest to play for me. it is a beautiful song that i wrote myself that noone except me and my guest have heard before. it will be the first time we perform it in front of anyone other than each other. i tell all this to my adoring fans in the audience and bring out "a great friend of mine" elijah wood. now i really dont know if elijah can even play any instruments but in daydreams anything can happen. so i sit there next to a guy i will only admit is just a friend singing a love song about wanting someone who doesnt even notice you that i wrote about him. by the time im half way through many people are already in tears and i am fighting quite hard to keep them back. i look over at him, smile, and let one lone tear escape and roll down my cheek. i know he sees it but i act like it never happened.  and thats just where it stops. i havent found an end for it yet. i dont know exactly what i want to happen but i have plenty of time to figure it out. in real life you cant just sit back and think about how you want things to happen and how you want people to react. it all just happens so fast you have to keep moving or get left behind. if this was really i would end the suspence and just tell you what happens but the script isnt finished yet. i have a lot of thinking to do before i even decided i want to continue this lame excuse for a relationship that takes up my time so i can avoid real ones. i think ill be a great writer someday. ill just write fiction.

      ive been feeling really alone the last couple days. maybe my daily ritual of watching dawson's creek is getting to me. their whole lives revolve around sex and relationships and thats just something that is really laking in my life right now. it's been almost 3 years since i had my last boyfriend, three long lonely years. it seems longer when i say it.  when the drought of my so called love life began i just wanted someone to fill that empty space. i didnt care how long it lasted i wanted the instant satisfaction of having someone that cared about you. i dont want that kinda relationship anymore. i dont want just some guy that isnt going to last. i dont want to be in a relationship witha guy that isnt the one for me. last nighted i wished on the stars just as i do every night like the true dreamer i am and i did wish for a specific guy like i usually do. i looked up into the sky and just said i feel like im walking around in my usual flip flops and only hearing the flip. i need my flop to feel complete. i dont care if its not clay aiken or jason mraz or elijah wood and i dont even care if its not mike*. i just want that one guy that is out there for me. i want him now so i can stop looking for him and wondering just who he is. i want him so i can feel complete, so i can be happy. thats what i wished for and i know now that that is the only thing that is going to change the subject of my wishes. if i have to wish for it everyday for the rest of my life i will. if thats what its gunna take for me to find him then ill do it. whatever it takes ill do it. untill that fateful day when i do find him and im truely complete i know what i have to do. i have to learn to be happy without a man in my life. sure it will get hard on those paticular days when everyone on dawsons creek seems so happy and in love but i know i have friends that will pull me up from the deep depression i get from seeing fictional people in fictional love with other fictional people that are fictionally their soulmates.  adults seem to think that kids cant possibly understand the concept of love let alone experience it or the pain caused by its absence. i think if anyone could just read some of my writings they would see that i know what it is like to be in love even though ive never experienced it. i know what its is like to be so alone you want to cry.  i could never show anybody my writings. they are too personal. i care way too much about what other people think. if someone read even just one and totally hated it and said it was completely ammature i would be crushed. the little confidence i do have is because of the great abilitly i think i have in expressing my emotions through words, whether it is just writen down or put to music. that is my confidence. that is the one thing i think i do with the most skill. you are just gunna have to take my word for it. i know love, experience or not.    mike* - mike is.....well he is this guy i have fallen head over heals for with only a few brief conversations. ive never liked a guy as much as i like him. its been almost two years with me only liking him. so many of my writings are directed around  him because i just have these intencelly strong feelings for him that i cant express in any other way than the privecy of my own thoughts. when i met him he was sitting at a table after school in the commons reading a book. not a book that everyone was reading because they had to but actually volunteerilly taking his time to pick out a book that suits his interests and reading it. call me a loser, nerd, geek, whatever but guys that read are a total turn on to me. i also know he is a virgin. in this day and age finding a guy in high school that is still a virgin is a hard task to complete. im not saying i only date virgins but i know i dont want to have sex until im married and dating someone who has the same veiws on that issue or atleast has not experienced sex yet is a plus. he also is a friggen guinius. if he was here right now he would be correcting every one of my spelling mistakes. i happen to love my spelling mistakes but in my writings i really would like someone there to tell me how to spell things correctly. it just looks more mature and intellectual if you spell all the words right. he knows like every thing in the world and loves history as much as i do. one of the best things about him is he makes me laugh. what most people see as immature i just see as hilarious. there is one thing i have to say though, a lot of people think he is gay. he dresses really nice most of the time and has incredible hair complete with highlights. i dont think it's his look that makes people think he is gay, its the fact that he has only had one girlfriend his entire life and that was in 8th grade. she treated him like crap, or so ive heard, very controlling and cheating on him every chance she got. i actually realized another thing that is quite odd. my last relationship was also in 8th grade and i ended it because he cheated on me. he was the first guy i ever liked that liked me back. both mine and mike's first and only relationships ended so badly that we havent dated since. i may not act like it or ever actually admit it but im scared. i dont want another guy to hurt me like that. just the thought that he wasnt happy with me and had to go else where. i dont want to feel that pain again. and mike, mike knows what that pain feels like to. he knows how bad it hurts and wouldnt do that to me. he just seems so right for me. with just the sight of him my whole body gets weak and my heart beats faster than i ever thought it could. my throat just locks up and i couldnt get a word out to save my life. im so scared im going to say something wrong to destroy any chance we ever had of having a successful relationship that i dont say anything at all. i try to imagine him feeling the same way about me that i feel about him. i want to think that he likes me so i dont feel like im wasting my time. i deny he knows how i feel about him. people tell me its obveous and how could he not know but i have no proof saying he knows. nobody has come up to me saying they have told him or saying they know someone who has told him so until that happens im assuming he doesnt know. on the days when im feeling paticualarlly depressed about my whole situation i cant help but think im not pretty enough for him. lets just face it he's popular, he is in with all the so called "cool" kids and im well im not. i dont wear the right clothes and i dont look a certain way. i dont wear make up and my idea of dressing up is khakis and a nice shirt. i dont fit in with those kids. why would he want to be with a girl like me. i could talk about him and how he makes me feel until hell freezes over and that wouldnt do anything. when comes down to it i just dont know. i dont know if he likes me and if he doesnt i dont know why. i dont know if the rumors about him being gay are true or not. i dont even know if im ready for a relationship. the only thing i am truely positive about is that these feelings i have for him dont seem to be going anywhere and thats quite alright with me. maybe things will change over the summer and i will change into the gorgous person i want to be for him and maybe he will finally see in me what i have always seen in him and maybe he wont. maybe nothing will change and ten years from now ill be looking back thinking i should have done something. thats my choice i will either move on or do something but i refuse to look back and still be wondering what could have been. i refuse to regret the decisions i have made. he makes me happy and thats what i want right now i want to be happy. if he isnt the one that will make me happy i want to move on and find the person that will. i say these things all the time but the probability of me actually acting on these thoughts is quite slim.

      ahh yesterday was a long long long day. after my dear nephew kyle who is but one and a half years old fell asleep at 6 oclock and woke up at 9:30 i took it upon myself to contiue his care untill his mother returned home. we watched aladdin and the second one then we watched 101 dalmations. he thought it was the funniest thing in the world to bark everytime one of the dogs on tv barked. so by now it is like midnight and im really started to wonder where in the hell my sister is. im not the type who just gets really mad that they are not home. i worry. if someone is not back when they say they are i go into parent mode. not having any children you may thing of this is odd i just think i am prepared for the future. it is like if someone is a few minutes late but when it is going on a couple hours late something bad had to have happened. of coarse nothing bad does every happen it was just raining and she had to walk home from where ever she was and didnt want to walk with kyle thus getting him wet too. i did not know this untill about 8:30 this morning. let me tell you right now it is not easy to sleep with a little boy in your bed. he fell asleep staring out the window which i thought was the cutest thing in the world considering that is exactly how i fall asleep every night. little did i know throughtout the night he would move himself to the middle of the bed. now keep in mind my bed is just for me it is just enough room for me but i managed to squeeze in a baby. so picture this, my itty bitty bed with a baby night in the middle sleeping and me holding on for dear life. i didnt want to move him for fear i would wake him up and then i would be able to say i watched the whole aladdin trilogy in one night. many people dont know that aladdin is a trilogy but it is. in the third one you meet aladdin's dad and aladdin and jasmine finally get married. any way back to my story. i was up atleast a dozen times during the night because kyle couldnt deside if he wanted to hog my little cloud blanket all to himself or have nothing to do with it. he finally awoke at 8 which is way to early for me given the conditions of the night before. atleast i got to watch dawson's creek. i watch it every weekday at 9 till 11 (two episodes). sometimes i find myself wishing it were still on so i could be a part of it. when it first came out i think i was in 6th grade. i being almost into my 3rd year of high school now see how unrealistic it really is. people in high school dont use big words all the time like they do. they dont analyze their evey action. they also dont look like they are in their mid twenties. that is the huge thing i hate about tv. they get 20 year olds to play high school kids. so since everyone is so influenced by the tv they watch they get these images of high schoolers looking a lot older than we actually look. i will never look my age and i blame tv.   after watching my daily 2 hours of unrealistic television. i head of to bed. needless to say i am totally not staying awake the rest of the day without atleast a nap. so i take a nap and figure ill eat some lunch after i wake up not thinking i would sleep as long as i didnt. it was a quarter after two when i woke up. it is now ten to 3 in the thirty five minutes i have been awake ive managed to change clothes, read through yesterdays entry, and type this emotionless piece of work that now after reading yesterdays entry again should be deleted forever because it does not stand up to the other master pieces i write. but deleting this would be like me admitting im a failure and wasted my time completely and then i would have to write a whole entire new entry for today all over again and i am just too lazy to do that. so with 7 minutes before the approximate time my parents should return from work i say ta ta and head off to seise the cries of my empty stomach.

      here i sit, hands sticky with gel that doesnt seem to wash away (believe me my hands pain for constant scrubing) , trying to recreate someone else's idea into a way that is all my own. after reading so many of jasonmraz's journals i realize i want something like that of my own. just something where i can write down all the things that happen even on days that seem boring and endless. i know i will never be as great a writer as he is considering he has a couple years doing this and i just started. i guess everyones gotta start somewhere. jason (wow does it feel weird to only say your first name, its like im close with you but im not so im lying) if by some chance you read this you are my inspiration, my inspiration to copy your idea just filling in the blanks with my own thoughts instead of yours.  as i said before my hands are sticky from the new gel ive been using in my hair. my sister is always capable to do anything she wants with her hair and it looks fantabulous. i on the other hand can barely manage of half way decent ponytail which i recently read in my ym magazine is totally bad for your hair. so i guess it isnt even fair to say i can even accomplish the simplest of tasks a ponytail. my father having curly hair and my mother having incredibly staight hair i am stuck with something inbetween which i have dubbed "wavy".  my sister has about the same type of hair but it works for her. she can change it from straight to curly in 10 min tops. so i decided once again to copy the ideas of the people who i must say am totally jealous of. i use her curling iron that looks really firmilar as if it used to be owned by me to straighten my hair everyday. but now that school is out and i have nothing to do all summer than write my boring day by day actions down in my computer for anyone in my family to easily access. well accept my dad. not to my suprise but he doesnt even know how to turn a computer on let alone opperate one. so i had my mom buy me some gel to begin mastering the "curly" look that comes so easily to her. it accually works! it doesnt hold all day like hers and is a lot more frizzy but i have all summer to perfect it.  my sister be granted with the beauty, tan skin, excellent artistic ability and art of hair and make up in the family it leaves me to wonder what i got when the genes were passed out. o of coarse i got the intellegence. or atleast thats what my parents say. im the smart one. the smart one with after 2 years of high school has a 2.73 gpa. nothing to be proud of. back in middle school i was a 4.0 without even trying. they try to tell you that middle school specifically 8th grade prepares you for high school. ya right! why was there such a dramatic drop in my gpa if i was considered ready for high school after my 8th grade year? probably is my lack of effort and over all boredom with the subjects being taught. when seeing my math grade my mother was especially disappointed. math is the easiest thing in the world for me. i am evidence alone that intellegence is not heireditary. my dad, well lets just say in a box of crayons he is a gray. and well my mom she has the art stuff and always loved english. nobody in my entire and complete family history has ever prospered in mathematics.and i do. once again leaving me to believe im adopted. my math class at the moment bores me out of my mind. i hate it when teachers sit and lecture the whole class about things i already understand. why cant they just let us work and trust us to ask for help if we need it. i know why because there are those people afraid of looking stupid who never ask for help when they are struggling. it is because of these people i am constantly falling asleep through lectures, not hearing the homework assignments, thus not completing the homework assignments, and still geting a's on all my tests. this leaves my grades at c's. so as you can see it is not my fault it is everyone elses.  now clearly seeing that i recieved nothing from my so called parents in the heireditary genes area i wonder how i got into this family. i know i am not adopted. my sister and i are only 14 months apart and we arent exactly wealthy. we get by but barely. so other than the people that claim my mother and i look alike and my horribly bad vision there is no connection between me and any member of my extended family. so if your reading this and looking for a long lost sister im right here. i must have been left on the door step or something. maybe they just found me because there is no way i belong here.

      there it goes. all my hopes, dreams, out the window all because i have to depend on other people. everything is going against me. everyone around me, even my own body is working against me. when all i want to do is to fight for what i have dreamed of all my life i have to face the facts that there is little to be done that will even slightly impact my current situation. fate has screwed me over once again. it sets me up just so i can fall. i fill my head with positive thought, everyone always tells you to think positively, i tell myself i can do it, practices for hours everyday just so fate can pull everything out of my grasp. what am i left to do but rant and rave? i avoid using the classic "life isnt fair" line because i am the poster child of the statement. but just when i think ive found my way out everything blurs and im stuck again. i cant wait. i cant wait for another chance just for it to be pulled out from under my feet again leaving me wondering why i even bother. this is my life. this is the only thing that has ever felt right for me. do people like to see me tortued, build up my hopes to watch me fall? im not going to just sit back and watch everything ive worked for crumble in my hands. i will fight till the end. im not giving up no matter how impossible it may seem.

      sometimes you have to do what you want to do. you have to ignore everyone else and do what makes you happy. thats what i have to do. i have to do whatever it takes, put my heart out on the line. i have to work hard and push myself to go farther than i ever have before. this could be my big break, the moment i have been waiting for my entire life. im not going to regret anymore. i cant be haunted with thoughts of what if. i have to go for it. it is not a question any more. i will practice. i will get people to listen, anyone to listen. i will except their comments and improve. i will make it to that audition even if i have to walk. im thinking of this as my only opprotunity. i cant blow it.

      considering i will be trying out for american idol on august 4th if everything goes according to plans i got bored and decided to answer all the questions they asked clay aiken. wish me luck!  Age: 16   From: Beaver Dam, Wi   Favorite Song: o i have so many   Idol: i dont really have an idol. there are many people who inspire me but an idol is someone you look up to and want to be like. i strive to be my own person.   Do you have a job?  i am currently jobless. it sucks! &nbsp; Do you have any formal singing training?  unless you count choir lessons once a week in school, no &nbsp; Where have you performed before?  for my very last choir concert i had a deut. i was so proud of myself. my choir teacher was getting cut, i loved her. and the other choir teacher, who taught the two "better" choirs hated me. i didnt want to sing without Mrs. Metz. &nbsp; When did you first start to sing?  umm wow. i really dont remember. i would love to say all my life but that would be a lie. ive always loved music but to pinpoint the exact moment i started singing or even give an educated guess would be impossible. &nbsp; What is your favorite song to sing? the beatles. i love the beatles.  &nbsp; What is the first concert you went to?  it was just last summer maroon 5 and john mayer, some people who truely inspire me. it was amazing. adam, the lead singer of maroon 5 (really hot, if your reading this call me when i turn 18), was sharp for half the show. that caused me to sing along sharp. it bothered me. from my seat they were only like 4inches tall but it was still so amazing. &nbsp; What is the last concert you went to?  that was actually my only concert. so ill use this space to talk about it more. it was at summerfest july 2nd 2004. im still wearing the wristband. the wristband used to say july 1st, its a little hard to read now, but they must have ran out of them that day and had to use some from the day before. i refuse to take it off. i want to see how long it lasts.  &nbsp; What other talents do you have?  like weird talents, i have the talent of exageration. i love this talent. for other talents i write. i love to write. kara wants me to be a writer. she read my online journal and all the stuff i write and she tell me all the time how good i am. &nbsp; If you don't make it on AMERICAN IDOL, what will you do?  i actually want to do so many things i wouldnt know where to begin. ive lived in the same small town my whole life only traveling to ohio and chicago twice. i want to see the world. &nbsp; What are your goals in life?  now dont laugh her im being honest. i want to start a charity. it wouldnt be designed just to help a certain group of people but to help anyone that needs it. i want to have an orphange and a homeless shelter. i really want to help the homeless. i would give them a place to stay, a phone number to put on job applications. i would give the clothes, showers, haircuts. anything they needed to get themselves back on their feet. knowing there are people in the world with no place to live, thinking nobody cares about them is enough to make me cry. i would also help people get out of bad situations, abusive situations. i just really want to help people. everyone should be happy with the life they are living.  &nbsp; What album would your friends be surprised you own? i love music, just music in general. my friends see that in me. they would only be suprised if i through away a cd. &nbsp; What is the first CD you ever bought? i wish it was some classic album but it was nsync. everyone goes through their boy band stage. &nbsp; What is in your CD player right now?i really dont know. it changes with my mood. if i feel like standing infront of my mirror singing and dancing ill throw in pop, clay aiken most likely. if i feel happy and want to stay in that mood which is most of the time i pick some oldies, beatles most likely, maybe the monkees or some motown. im sometimes in a punk mood, fefe dobson, josie and the pussycats, new found glory, yellowcard, this list goes on forever. and sometimes i listen for the words, i want something deep. jason mraz, john mayer, the beatles, coldplay, john lennon, all truely great songwriters. it all depends on me.  &nbsp; Who is your AMERICAN IDOL? i dont really have an idol. there are tons of people who have qualities i love. my mother is the easiest person to talk to. people come to her and open up. i love that about her. clay aiken is the purest, most genuine person i know of. everything about him just screams sincerity. john mayer, he's a writer. i want to write like him. jason mraz. i could go on about him forever. i read his road journals. he is a funny guy. also a great writer. he is so real. celebrities in my eyes sometimes seem too good to be true, just like i made them up. but not him his is real to me. the beatles, john lennon especially. writers, the best writers. they are music. they dont play music, they are the music. possibly the greatest band to walk the earth, i know in my eyes they are. i remember my mom saying something would be the greatest thing in the world and i said no, the greatest thing in the world would be if john lennon was still alive. she said i bet his wife and son would agree with you. whenever im asked if you could go back in time and meet one person who would it be. i always say ghandi or john lennon. if i could change one thing i would make sure that john lennon was never shot that night on december 8th 1980. little trivia for you, that was also my mothers 16th birthday. i dont consider anyone my idol. there are qualities i love about everyone but im not going to imitate them. im going to be me. &nbsp; What is your favorite type of music?i love everything. im literally obsessed with music. &nbsp; What is your favorite song?i have way to many. &nbsp; Favorite male pop artist?and the list goes on. the beatles, john lennon, george harrison, john mayer, jason mraz, maroon 5, coldplay, there is more but ill stop now. Favorite female pop artist?i dont really like female singers much. maybe it is just me but i havent found a female who is able to write the deep type of lyrics that i have recently grown to worship. i love fefe dobson though. the strong beats and rock like style. josie and the pussycats. i realize it was just a movie but i love the songs. &nbsp; Favorite album?once again i have too many. &nbsp; Who in the music world do you think your style is most like?i really dont know. i try not to compare people. everyone is there own individual. to quote elijah wood "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self." im sure i have similarities to many musicians, especailly those who inspire me, but i would appriciate it if you didnt compare me to people with so much more experience than me.  &nbsp; Most embarrassing moment?o goodness. there are many. i dont want to talk about it. &nbsp; If you couldn't sing, which talent would you most like to have? i wish i could play the piano or drums. im learning the guitar, well trying to learn. but i love the piano. there is something just so classic and romantic about it. you dont really see girls playing the drums that often. i dont have the corrdenation for it but it would be something i am willing to work hard for. &nbsp; What has been your proudest moment in life so far? well im not really sure. &nbsp; What is your definition of an AMERICAN IDOL? and idol is someone you look up to. someone you strive to be like.  &nbsp; Why do you want to be an AMERICAN IDOL? honestly? i want to be a singer because music is my passion. the only thing ive ever done that has felt like i was doing the right thing. im not going to stand here and say i want to be a singer for the money so i can be rich. sure the money is a part of it but it has always bothered me to watch cribs or hear about these celebrities with 3 houses, 10 cars, or something like that. its outragous. there are people in this would who dont know if they will be able to eat the next day and celebrities who only seem to care about how many diamonds they are wearing. i want the money for my charity. im not going to lie and say i dont want a house. i want a huge house but im not going to have more than one. im not going to get a car. i dont even have my licence for goodness sakes. im still going to shop and kohls and head straight to the clearance rack. thats how i was raised, it instict. i could not go out and spend even $50 dollars on a pair of jeans and not feel guilty. i think celebrities miss that point. they think ive worked hard to get this far i should reward myself. sure if i get a recording contract i will have worked my butt off but the recording contract is my reward not some $500 dollar pair of shoes im only going to wear once. i dont see how people can do that. im going to work hard so i can be better off, so my mother can have a good life, and im going to work even harder so nobody has to live a life that is horrid. &nbsp; Do you think the audition process was fair? well let me just say i have a few concerns about the first audition. it says in the rules producers are allowed to pick people out of line. so do you mean to tell me i may sit there for over a full 24 hour period just to get over looked because some girl is wearing a short skirt or looks more attractive than me?! now that i have a problem with. &nbsp; Who is your favorite judge and why? i like simon. sure he is harsh and gets off topic. it pisses me off when he makes comments about appearance other than musical talent but in the end he is real. he tells you what you need to hear good or bad. &nbsp; Who is your least favorite judge and why? honestly, randy. sometimes i dont understand i word he says. &nbsp; What advice do you have for other hopefuls? just be yourself. practice and think that this is your only shot. give it your all. &nbsp; What would people be surprised to learn about you? lets not get into this now. lets just say i have a past, a past i dont plan to make public anytime soon. &nbsp; Who did you think was going to win last season?ok i got this one. its the curse of american idol. season 1- tamyra grey left when it came down to final 4, season 2- clay aiken was the runner up, season 3- la toya when it came down to final four she left now where have we heard that before. in my opinion american idol contiues because we have yet to crown the person with the most talent in that season american idol. &nbsp; If you could be a performer from any era, which would you choose and why?the 60's minus the drugs. i would love to meet the beatles. to sing with the beatles. i would die a very happy person. also in the 60's i would have loved to do anti-war songs. i am strongly against war, vietnam being the biggest mistake america has ever made. im a very political person. im educated about what is going on. in the 60's with civil rights and the war i would have loved to be a part of it and make an impact.

      a lot of stuff has been going on lately. i started a fight with someone. wow that was hilarious. it wasnt like a serious fight. i turned their words around to make them insults towards me. then they had to go a bring this other friend of ours into it. this other friend said some choice words that i can not forgive him for. lets just get this straight no one calls me a bitch, slut, whore, stuck-up, selfish or anything along those lines. i am not any of those things and just the fact that he said one of those words to me makes me hate him. sure maybe someday in the future ill forgive him but that sorta thing stays with me forever. i have a great memory.  see i was just having a little fun it was a joke. i was just about to clue him in on it when he said it. ive told him so many things that i havent told anyone else and then he goes and does that. he is an asshole. he is the hugest jerk in the world. i seriously hate him. if he says that to my face just imagine what he says behind my back. if youre reading this i cant talk to you knowing what you truely think of me. see im not the kinda of person you can just joke around with and call a bitch or a whore. i am not a whore, im not a slut, and im not a bitch. dont call me them. i take stuff like that personally. i dont know how people can let words like that mean nothing. i really dont like people swearing but you know that is their personality, im not going to change them. but i cant stand someone swearing about a person. that is the rudest thing in the world. i dont get sad or cry or anything. they dont hurt like that. it makes me so angry i dont know what to do. im against violence but sometimes its hard to controll it. so i play solitaire. im extememly addictied to solitaire. makes all your problems drift away and the only thing that matters is where to place the next card.

      people tell me i should write. do you think i should write? but write what. see this is easy for me. i just write what is going on in my life and how i feel about it. im not a writer. im a singer. or actor. maybe a music writer but thats even far fetched in my mind at the moment. sure i love to write, about love mostly. but with no love of my life at the moment besides my daydreams of elijah wood its hard. i havent seen mike for a month. its hard going from seeing him everyday to without him for 3 months. sure im over him, or atleast it feels like i am, but he is my inspiration. just about everything ive writen can be connected to him. taking away my inspiration is like taking away my heart. i cant write without inspiration just like i cant live without my heart. inspiration is not something you can puchase at your local supermarket. its incredibly difficult to find. i was so lucky to find a never ending sorce that i could just look at and make the words flow.  it was just came so easy. now i have this weird form of writersblock, which i cant have cause im not a writer. i dont even have a picture or anything, just memories. what do i do if i go back to school and i dont feel anything. really feel nothing. i realize that that would be a personal breakthrough as this crush will have been going on for 3 years the end of october. but what do i do. i love to write. but what am i to do with nothing to write about. i write about the pain and longing in my heart and soul but what can i write about in the absence of that? it honestly scares me. i cant fake having feelings for him just as i couldnt ignore them when they were there. i tried everything, finding someone else, reading my old stuff. nobody ive found is as real as him or makes me feel the same way just looking into his eyes made me feel. he was so great for me. so amazingly perfect. i remember how he made me feel, but i dont feel it. its a hard feeling to describe. just everytime i heard his voice or looked into his eyes i felt complete, like i could stop looking. ive never felt that before, didnt think i would for a long time. but now its gone. can that happen? can everything ive ever felt for him vanish just as quickly as it conquered my soul? ever since the dream everything has just been so weird. that was the last great entry i wrote. i told myself it was over, convinced myself there was nothing a long time ago. why did it stay so long before leaving my head dry. i have nothing to write about, no inspiration. you cant replace an inspiration like that. or find another. i morn my lose. i morn him not being in my thoughts. i dont think i'll ever write again.   to read what i write about him go to - http://thethingsiwrite.blogspot.com i will be posting on it soon if it is blank now.

      im shopping once again. for a girl who basically only wears jeans, tshirts, flip flops, and sneakers i sure shop a  lot. ive actually been trying, not very hard but im trying. its a paradox though. no one will hire me because i dont have experience but then how am i supposed to get experience?i handed in one application and i plan on calling on wednesday to see if they looked at it. im currently looking for orange shoes. sooooo hard to find. there was this kid at school with by far the coolest orange shoes but like im gunna talk to the guy i had a crush on for a year and a half. im over him now. well i havent seen him for about a month so that helps. any way i have a feeling i will be up all night. everything is white these days. its so hard to find a nice red, orange, or geen pair of shoes. so i guess ill just keep looking. ya i now this journal sucks but im a little preoccupied at the moment. promise the next will be better.

      im going to be british. so if anybody has any tips for me, my friend michelle and i would love to be british. we are both part english as it is so we sorta are. we watched the beatles a hard days night and we love the accents. well i love the accents. i dont know if she does. but how can you not? how long do you think i would have to live there to get the accent? scottish accents are cool too. billy boyd. oh my he is hot. i dont care if he is old enough to be my father, he is sexy. he wears a kilt too. kilts are hot. well not for everyone, but on him wow its great. anyway we are trying to get to know all the british slang. i found a site that is the american's guide to being british.   i had a rather exciting weekend. went to beske's birthday party. fun. jessica invited over this guy that was just walking down the street. he was going door to door getting donations for john kerry. loved him just for that. since we were in the back yard we seen him walk by. he ate some pizza and drank some soda, talked with us about basically nothing importants. he was hot. 19, very hot. also had a girlfriend. o well its not like i want a boyfriend anyway. they tried to get his number though, failed. then yesterday aly, michelle, brandie, and i went to the fireworks for lakedays. that was awsome. except for brandie talking about my friend nick driving without his licence, doing drugs, smoking, and drinking with my mum right in the room. that sucked. we went to the fireworks and had a blast just lying there talking about stuff. stuff on a stick. beersicles. dont ask. brandie had to leave right after. michelle and i carried on the tradition of breaking into the churches playground with aly there this time. we dont really have to break in but the first time we wanted to go in we thought we did. we felt like rebels. we were swingers that night. i love to swing. just looking up at the stars and feeling so disconnected from the world. we talk about a lot of stuff on those swings, just to be invited on a swinging trip is a rare event. michelle and i talk about a lot. we tend not to envolve other people. then we felt like little kids and went on this like futuristic teter toter. we went down this like twisty slide. first regular then we went down face first on our stomachs, then on our backs head first. we got stuck around the turns. it was great fun. then we took the blankets we used at the fireworks and used them as capes, we flew home. there were these guys standing in the middle of the road that we walked past and they asked us if we had clothes on underneath our capes. thats just sick. anyway we got to my house around 12, well before that cuz that was aly's curfew. she went home and michelle slept over. we then watched the beatles hard days night movie. GREAT MOVIE. we tried to watch west side story but we were tired and it was too easy to make fun of. we got up around 10 and went to the craft fair. there is a lot of junk there. we spent like a half hour maybe just wandering. then we walked over to her house and played harry potter. yes harry potter. it was fun. i liked it. we went to scoops to get ice cream then she took me home. my mom took me to kohls later. i got a sweet new pair of jeans that came with a belt and then i got another belt. the belt i bought is a hologram belt. like its all these pictures of public places like street signs and buildings then you move it and the picture changes to all this graffitie. it was 6.99 down from 16.00. i was pleased with my great deal. then when i got back i went on ebay. im bidding on this sweet beatles jacket. its silver and blue. i love it. im finding all this stuff i love. ties, belt buckle, tshirts. i dont understand the belt buckle thing. can you buy a belt that you can put the buckle on? my mum said i could but where do i find such belts? o well this is getting long. ill talk about the beatles another day.

      jason mraz. what can i say about the man. never met him but would love to, already feel like i did. i want to meet him. my idol. he just is so real. so incredibly real. thats my dream. i want to meet the man behind the thoughts ive been constantly reading for days. he is, in a way, responsible for you wasting your time reading this. there is no sexual attraction, no crush on him in anyway. just aww. how could i even speak to him. my words are meaningless to him. he is amazing. i read his journal all the time. i feel like i know him, like i always have. the way he writes, i want to write like him. every word just perfect, never saying to much or not enough. i just feel like ive experienced every moment he has writen about with him, like as it happened i was standing right there watching. he is hilarious. he puts me in a great mood even when i feel like shit. i usually dont swear but it felt appropriate there. i encourage everyone to buy his cd. he writes all his own music and lyrics. well my 2 favorite songs were poems he put to music but still he is incredible. great musician. just the best. besides the beatles that is. i suggest everyone one go to www.jasonmraz.com right away. read the journal, look at the pictures, listen to the music. he has potential to be great, potential to be big. he is just such a happy person. always looking on the bright side, loving life and every aspect of it. but then again if i had the career he has i would feel the same. he is a strong person, stronger than i could ever imagine being. he is wise too, wise about life. he knows what he is doing, he's loving life and sharing it with the world. ive said enough, dont take my word for it. go find out yourself. my idol, my man, my favorite stranger, jason mraz.

      being this is my journal i feel there are certain things you should know about me. well actually just one. i hate my body. i know most of you are thinking well who doesnt. im not over weight in any way. but i dont know there is just something about it. i know anerexia and belimia is wrong. i would never thing of doing that. i exercise. i exercise everyday. i love it. the sweat, the tense feelings you get in your muscles. the best part is actually seeing the results. being able to see that all your hard work has paid off. i dont hate my whole body. i love my hair, my eyes, my lips, and my calves. but mostly my hair. i used to hate how dark it was. i tried to change it many times, blonde, red, even tried adding highlights. now i love it, after trying everything i love what i have. its wasnt a matter of realizing everything else looks bad it was a matter of experimenting. i hate my stomach, thighs, chest, feet, butt and skin. my skin is too pale. it doesnt have that nice bronze look everyone else seems to love. i refuse to fake tan and in the sun i just burn. ive given up. someday i will be happy with it but right now, in high school where body matters most, im not. the other parts are just not in shape. i know they could be worse but i want to be in shape. i want to be fit. i dont own a swimsuit or even a pair of shorts. i dont own a dress or any low cut shirts. not even a tank top. they make me feel uncomfortable. i love my jeans, tshirts, and flip flops. thats who i am. im not going to change that. even with exercise. if i get in shape and look amazing im not going to show off my body. i love the clothes i wear and im not going to wear certain clothes because i have the figure for it. i also dont wear make-up. i dont like it. i dont want someone to love me when im hiding behind layers of make-up. i dont need to hide. ive always believed that you dont need plastic surgery and make-up to look beautiful. if a guy wants me to change who i am, wear skimpy clothes and put on make up, i will dump his ass right then and there. i am beautiful the way i am. sure there are certain parts of me that in my own opinion need work. but any guy who is going to tell me that doesnt deserve me. i work out for me, not to please the rest of the world. that is my message to the world. it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks. if your happy with yourself and who you are than thats the only thing that matters. if your happy who cares what anyone else thinks.

      ok this has been bothering me since after it happened. ok so this was on july 2nd the day i went to summerfest and went to the concert. well this was obviously my parents first time driving in milwakee. we were looking for my cousins house so we could drop off some stuff for him. we were LOST. my dad pulled over to look at the map because i guess it was all my moms fault with her poor navigating skills. anyway while driving i love to look at the beautiful houses that are around. so i took this opprotunity to check them out. there was a guy holding a ladder for this other guy. from what i could see sitting behind tinted windows, being about 15 feet away from him, and not having the cleanest glasses in the world he looked pretty cute. then i guess he seen me looking in his direction and he waved. shocked, i smiled and looked away. i looked back a minute later to see he was still staring at me. he once again waved and i ignored. as we drove away i tried to devore myself into my beatles music and excellent courtroom book. i couldnt do it. i couldnt get it off my mind how rude i was. he waved at me not once but TWICE and i ingored him not once but TWICE! now usually i am the one waving to strangers and pondering why they dont wave back but when put in the same situation of a strange person waving at me i do the same thing i hate people doing to me. so if this story sounds firmiliar to you and you were that person waving at me. IM SORRY. ok im really really sorry. ive never been that rude to someone in my whole life. this is my special "wave" to him. i doubt he will ever read this but just in case.

      i had the dream again. all day ive been having this dream. everytime i close my eyes it runs through my head nonstop. it shouldnt be bothering me as much as it is. ive had dreams about him before. mike. he used to be in all my dreams. him and i together, dating. i have barely even thought of him all summer and i stopped have dreams about him months ago. why now. just when im looking forward to starting school. this summer has been great so far for me. im getting in shape, have this incredible confidence i never knew exsisted, and soon to have a new wardrobe that fits my new optimistic look on life. why now. i thought it would be great go back to school and be over him. not feel like i have to be someone else, watch what i say and do for fear he will see and dislike me even more than i already think he does. in the dream im at school with my friend kara. she is waiting for cheer practice to start and im sitting with her and all the other cheerleaders. mike and his best friend chris, who has always acted especially wierd around me, are sitting at a different table. kara is the only one that knows im not going to be in cheerleading this year. realizing this i feel akward sitting in the group. i ask kara if she wants to walk around with me. i walk over to the pay phone to call my mom and ask if she can come pick me up. nobody answers. i slam the reciever down saying a few choice words out of anger. we walk back over to the table where we left i back packs. i pull on my coat because for some reason it is snowing outside, being it is the first day of practice during the school year i guess the time to be around mid september so there being snow is really strange. kara walks with me over to the door that leads out to the parking lot, the exit farthest from my house which is also weird. as i opening the door and saying goodbye to kara making her promise she will call me after practice, chris runs up to us. he asks me if i would like to be mike's girlfriend. that was it. he didnt say anything about mike liking me for a long time or even explain why he is asking me and not mike. i respond are you only asking me because you both know i really like him. he nods his head. this makes me mad. i dont know why but it does. maybe im thinking that they are playing some kind of joke on me. asking me out to her me say yes then laugh in my face because i actually thought a guy like him would go for a girl like me. i push open the door and storm off into what looks like a blizzard. chris is still standing at the door watching me leave. and then my sister woke me up or something always wakes me up right there. i dont know what to think of it. maybe its telling me im not over him or maybe that he really does like me. maybe its predicting the future. its happened before. in sixth grade. i liked this guy a lot. he called me and asked me out. i thought it was a joke and said no.  i never did find out if it was or not. then again maybe the dream is telling me i am over him. so over him if he asked me out id say no. i dont know. maybe this maybe that. i can come up with all the theroys in the world but ill never know. im gunna tell kara about it. considering she was in it i believe that gives her the right to know what happened, even if she didnt have a major role. maybe she has some insight and can help shed a little light on to this event.

      i love road journals. what a great concept, for an artist to open up about everything that is happening to loyal fans that read every single one. i read jason mraz's a lot more lately. i dont know what it is about it that just attracts me to it the second i turn on the computer. i copy and pasted them all onto a wordpad so i dont have to be online to read them. play a few games a solitaire and sing along to whatever songs seem to float my boat that day. if i come across a song that i either dont know the words to, HA me not know the words to a song what am i thinking! lets rephrase that. if i come across a song i either dont feel like singing to or just want to hear the voice of the person who makes a living with the song then i bust open the journal i have entitled "journal" for lack of creativity. i went online to buy a john mayer tshirt after i went to his concert with maroon 5 opening for him. me the critic: maroon 5- adam needs hair, he just looks to old for little high school me to like with out it, ryan (sooooo hot, drummer) wasnt even there cause of a shoulder injury (damn!),  adam was off pitch during the first half causing me to sing along just as sharp as he was, john mayer- only looked 4 inches tall but wow was he good, nothing bad to say about the man. i didnt buy a tshirt there thinking i could find better ones online which i did. while i was online i found he also takes the time to speak to his fans via road journal. his is nothing compared to jason mraz. its all facts and crap. i only read the first one but wow did it suck, started tour, blah blah, song list, blah blah. it was just dumb. no emotion or anything personal in the whole thing. what a waste of 3 seconds, ya im exagerating but it was extremely short. i read road journals to fulfill my fantasy of actually knowing these people. i start to feel a connection with them as if we could be friends some day despite the 10 year, 3 month, and 3 day age difference jason mraz and i have. i starts to feel like they are writing it so you can read it. i know youre thinking well duh they write it so people can read it. im dont mean people in general but just me. its like a letter or something. only ment for me to read. its a way of getting to know someone and feeling some sort of connections wether it really be there or just formed in your imagination. lets face it, logically i will never meet these people i admire as singer/songwriters. road journals are my connection to them, my only connection to them.

      my first concert. possibly the greatest night of my life. sure i didnt have the greatest seats in the world.......but wow. i was dead center perfect view for the big screen that they show for the people so far back they cant even see the stage. i..i could see the stage. technically it was not my very first concert. at my school they do this thing called beaverstock every year in the school auditorium where local bands play. this was nothing my beaverstock. it was purely incredible. even if from my seat they were only 4 inches tall i still couldnt look at the big screen. maybe its just me but celebrities just seem fake to me. so great that they cant possibly be real. i just made them up in my head. looking at the big screen just increased the feeling that it was all my imagination. i had to look at their four inch bodies and keep telling my self that there they are, right in front of me, only a couple hundred feet away. it was just amazing. i sang along to every word not being able to hear my own voice that was being drowned out by the intesity of the music. i love the feeling of the vibrations of sounds. their voice and words filling my whole body, taking over me as if nothing else in the world was worth living for. seas of screaming people that at times just disappeared and it was just me. just me and the people i finally now see are real. the energy of the music, musicians, and crowd consumes my entire soul and i feel like ive been lifted off the ground and reached heaven. for once in my life nothing seemed to matter. the great feeling of being out of touch with the whole world. i wasnt worring about my life and all the problems that come along with it. i wasnt thinking about anything. even the imence pain in my legs from standing and dancing from 8 till midnight didnt cross my mind. my whole body was numb. if anybody around me would have tried to address me i wouldnt hear them. they werent there to me. i looked right through everyone infront of me in the completely sold out amplitheater. nothing else matter but what was going on on stage. i loved it when you could hear everyone around singing along even if it felt like it was only my voice. a lighter song is a must at every concert. the lighter in my pocket was a constant reminder of this. i urged to take it out during every song. i resisted waiting for the perfect moment. of coarse the time came. i pulled it out and tried desperately to keep it lit. the wind was against me leaving my flame burning only a few seconds. i could see everyone around me having the same problem. i eventually got it to stay a little longer lasting half a minute if i was lucky. amongst the enless darkness i imagined the crowd looked like from the stage there was a light. a flickering light in the middle of the darkness and noice. that was my light. i prayed that maybe just maybe his eyes would drift to my light and he would see my light and smile. if this happened i was too far away to tell. as he left the stage everyone still cheered him on. we could still see him standing off stage and i was determinded to scream and cheer until he was completely gone and i was forced to return to my complicated life. he returned and did two more songs. as he left the stage everyone now knowing he was coming back my soul floated back to my body. i was being pushed out of heaven by the people around me eager to leave. i just wanted to sit and play the whole night over again in my head. i wanted it to start over and keep going until i had fully appriciated it. maybe even wander down to the coveted front row seat and just stare up at the stage. i knew i couldnt do that. my night was over. i couldnt go back. it was already early morning the next day. my happiness is just a memory. i have no suvenieres except my ticket, lighter, and nyc tshirt to add to my collection. all but the shirt will be stored away in my kswiss shoe box with all the other reminders of times when i was happy. the box is nearly empty.

      im so confused at the moment. people can be so dissappointing. i love the beatles. i want to be as big as them, as talented as them. so today while lounging between the last 2 shevles of books at the library while my mother searched for ideas to remodel our deck i began to browse after discovering deck remodeling and music were right across from each other. i dont really see the logic in that but it worked to my advantage. i pulled out huge volumns of music encyclopedias looking to see how long the entry for the beatles was. i stumbled upon a book completely about the beatles. this perked my interest. by the time my mom had to literally drag me away from my newly found favorite sections, besides the cd and movie section that is, i had found 7 books dedicated to the band i instantly loved. my mother would not allow me to get all seven so i replaced the 3 i couldnt get with another 3 i found in the true crime section. so i stared reading my books immediatly realizing i have only a month to read 7 quite thick books. beyond his musical talent and spiritual veiw of life john lennon has nothing to be admired for. he contributed to the massive drug use of the 60's, his first wife filed for divorce because he was living with yoko ono, and he and yoko posed nude for the back cover of one of his solo albums. personally i never understood what he saw in yoko but love is love. i always believed he loved her and that was all the was important. now seeing more facts into his relationship history i feel he handled the situation all wrong. if he would have just filed for divorce himself and explained to cynthia that he was in love with another woman i probably would think more highly of him. this did not happen though. cynthia found out herself that he was not only being unfaithful but was infact living with another woman. after reading about the relationship john and cynthia had they seemed very much like the idealistic happy couple. so it is perplexing why everything happened the way it did. was he just going with the senereo of having a happy married life to avoid even more public exposure? were there marital problems that everyone refuses to talk about? did he really love yoko ono? enough to leave behind his wife and son to start over? the term midlife crisis comes to mind.
