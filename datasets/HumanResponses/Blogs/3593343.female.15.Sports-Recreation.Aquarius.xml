      I have never been so exhausted in my life. I worked my tail off this weekend. Friday I worked from 4pm-11:45 came home and got 3hours of sleep. Saturday I worked from 7am-11:00 came home and got 9 hours of sleep. Sunday, worked from 9am-5:30. So lastnight I slept like a baby. I went over to Justin's after he got off at 8:30 and spent some time with him. I came home around 11:30 or so b/c he has school tomorrow. But he doesnt have to go Tuesday b/c he has senior pictures. *YAY*  I had so much fun this weekend...only problem was I didnt see Justin as much as I intended. =S But he did come and see me and he called me. It was so hot in there though...especially Friday it was Me,Kiki,Dexter,Josh,Daniel,Kim,Cody,and some other woman Felisha (my boss) knew. But it was still fun..goofin off with everybody. and gahh Spencer is crazy...LoL...actin like he was snorting that Line Lime...LoL...or "abuda buda buda". And all the crazy times we tried to put Cody outside b/c we didnt want him around us b/c he gets on our nerves so bad. *grr* **HAHA** anywho...today's just another day I reckon... I think me and Justin might go out tonight...who knows. BUT anyway...I'm out...I may blog later.

      There are stars  In the Southern sky  Southward as you go  There is moonlight  And moss in the trees  Down the Seven Bridges Road   Now I have loved you like a baby  Like some lonesome child  And I have loved you in a tame way  And I have loved you wild   Sometimes there's a part of me Has to turn form here and go  Running like a child from these warm stars  Down the Seven Bridges Road   There are stars in the Southern sky  And if ever you decide  You should go  There is a taste of time sweetened honey  Down the Seven Bridges Road     ----that is the BESTEST song...the Eagles ROCK!!----

      Well today was very.... HOT !!!!  It got up to a wopping  95  degrees. And to make matters worse, I had to work...in that filthy hot concession stand. It was hotter in there than it was outside. I PROMISE! I decided to drive home, well we had to go by Veterans and get time cards to take to the Rec*Com, so I got to where I could see the fields and mom said turn right here in front of this cop...well the whole turning in front of the cop thing scared me b/c one: I didn't use my blinker and two: I was speeding. Well I pulled up to the gate and the cop come up behind me, I was like "OH CRAP-OLA" then I thought,hmm...mom was on the phone with Tracy a little bit ago and she called me while I was cleaning and I bet shes working. Well come to find out it was her and she was on her break so she could eat so she talked to us and ate and then she got called to some something on the mountain or something. Anywho,Justin's gotta work tomorrow. =( He has to work from 6am-3pm...but I have a family reunion to go to tomorrow at like noon in Skyline, then we're gonna leave there and come back by here and get our stuff and go over to my aunts and swim and Justin's gonna try to come by and swim or atleast hang out. I doubt I'll swim...UNLESS its as hot tomorrow as it was today...but I think I'm gonna lay out all day.  ~I Love Justin Hastings!!!!~

      well today was an experience...i got to help deliver chocolate labs. Hershey the mom went into labor i guess about 1 today and had two pups by 3 well she didnt hav anymore...so we called the vet and we met him at the office with her and the two puppies well he gave her a shot and said she should start having contractions when the 2 pups are nursing and she should start having more puppies. well no sooner than we got back to the house and around back she had another puppie by the pool. and so we took her and put her in the guest room/house and let her stay in there b/c the vet said to keep her somewhere cool and keep her laying down and let her nurse. wellby the time we got her in the room she had another puppie. by that time she had had 2 boys and 2 girls. well we left at about 6 and stopped by the grocery store and my aunt called and said they were on their 7th puppie. so we're gonna go over there later and look at em and help her prolly deliver more the dr said she would have about 12 puppies!!! and so far their all chocolate.

      well i got up this morning around 11 i guess and got my shower. then we went to Thomas Signs and bought *FiRwOrKs* then we came back here and watched tv for a couple of hours then we went out to my grandmothers at 2 and grilled out. i ended up leaving around 3:30 b/c justin got off work at 2:30 and called my cell and asked me if i wanted to go with him to his family 4th of july thing-a-ma-bob.so, i came back here and waited for justin to get here and then we left...he got to meet my uncle daren today.*haha*  i swear him and my dad are like dumb and dumber.LMAO. then after he came got me we had to stop by the BK and drop off a key he forgot he had in his pocket when he left work earlier. then we went over to county park to meet his parents and nita's side of the family. that was fun! me,justin,chad, and james all went out in hal's boat and rode it around. i love that boat its a 19ft bumbble bee with a 200 mercury. NICE BOAT! and jeremy's is nice too his is a 17ft bumbble bee with a johnson 175 on it. he took nita out in it and had it practically walking on the water...it was awesome. then we sat around and ate homeade ice cream and talked for a while. then we left around 8 and came to my house and as soon as we got here we left again. dad and mom went ahead and went to the boat ramp and i let justin drive my car b/c i needed to go get gas in it anyway. so after we get gas i told him to see what it would do,so he did and it surprised him. LoL..*lets race now buddy!!* and then we had to stop by my aunts real quick and when we we're comming down bob jones rd. we passed a cop and we thought he was gonna turn around so we took a little detour it was funny as hell. then we met mom and dad over at the boat ramp and shot fireworks. dad almost shot me and justin with a bottle rocket. we shot roman candles bottle rockets and m 90's and...some kind of rocket thing. then we came back here around 10 and me and justin layed in my room and talked and watched tv. then he left at 11 b/che has to work in the morning. but i'm gonna go to bed...its been a long day.   {{*}}thank you so much for giving me the best 4th of july i've ever had...i love you so much sweetie!!*kiss* =D {{*}}  ~I Love Justin E. Hastings!!!~

      today was great. I woke up around 11 or so and got my shower and went to the grocery store with mom. When we got back we ate lunch and we had to fix a cake to take to my aunts to cook out since my dad has to go to Pennsylvania tomorrow. well we fixed the cake and while it was cooling we went to the peoples house who we're buying my puppy from and i got to pick her out. I'm gonna either name her Libby or Corona. She's SO precious!!! only 2 more weeks till she get to come home with me!!**YAY** then after we came home justin called again around 4:30 and said he'd be at my aunts around 6. then we went to my aunts and when we got there daddy shattered the back glass of his bronco...how in the world...i dunno...i guess it was just too hot or somethin, who knows?! then we swam for about 2 hours i guess and Trey and Cole and Brandon we're all over there with Mason...so they swam with us. i got out and changed and go ready before justin got there then when he got there we ate and talked for a little while. Then Justin,me, and Tyler all rode over to Goospond Ampatheater and met up with his mom and dad and talked to them before the fireworks started. then we watched fireworks and the last couple of minutes we left to try to beat the traffic well we did pretty good i reckon... i think i counted only 4 people that walked/ran by that i didnt too much half any respect for...justin counted like 20...lol..nahh but there was a lot of em'.LoL. then we stopped by sonic. and he brought me home. but all in all today was great...i got to see my baby and i got to be with him to watch the fireworks. oh yeah i left out 2 things...LoL...*i believe they we're "togedda" for real!! dont you?* and ☼i forgot to tell you this but somebody asked me today when our wedding is gonna be, to let them know. i was like...hehe☼  welp i'm out...i have another long day ahead of me.        ~☼*I Love Justin E. Hastings!!!*☼~
