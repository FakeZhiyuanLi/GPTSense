       Well there has been a lot on my mind sence i seen Kyle the other day. I just don't know...but I think I'm really falling for him. I love everything about him, the way he smiles when he is happy, how sweet he is when he talks to me. I get so happy when i see him online. And i kinda got sad when he told me he can't comeover tomarrow, but It will all work out cuz we will see eachothe some other time...and i did just see him for a little bit at my sisters game. But it seems that everytime i see him i fall more and more.  I love the felling of this. I don't think I have ever felt this strong for someone before. My stomic hurts and my mind is in a million differnt placese...but it don't bother me cuz it is all over Kyle. Someone will tell me to do something and i'll have to ask what it is cuz i wasn't really listening why, because he is on my mind.  Thank you so much. My life has been the greatest the past week, or so. And it is all because of you. If you wern't in my life it would be boring like it used to be. But you make me so happy and I love it. I love everything about you.  You make me smile when i'm sad. You make me laugh so much that i could cry. You make me want to spend all my time with you. And when i open my heart to people it usually gets broken, but you promised not to. And i trust you.  You might get of line, but i still feel like i'm talking to you. You bitghten my world. And I love that...i love everything about you, you have a really big heart and you care for people, and the way they feel. You rock my world...and i don't ever want things to change.  I never new that you could fall this heard for someone this fast. But i love it. I love everything. It is so hard to be upset because, when i am all i have to do is think of you. You are the best...And i need to think about everything that has gone on this week. Because, you make my world complete.   I have my firnds, Brookie and Aly...and everyone else.....Brookie your there when i need to talk and i'm thinking we will...I think there wil be something going down with you and***...LOL...Thanks for everything girl...yout the best...I love you....Thanks for everything....;)...LOL   Ok well I have to go....

Your The best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me...I don't know how it happened or why, but when i met you you were so sweet to me and then at Aly's party I got upset because, i seen Kayle all over you, but you said I don't have to worrie. And I won't. I feel we met because some one up there ^ wanted us to. And that always makes it special. And if this all don't work out, which i really wish it would...i would still have a great friend...(but i really hope it is more)...But i will wait as long as&nbsp;i have to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are worth the wait. &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Brookie your the bestest...thanks for filling me in on everything. I don't know what i eould do without you. You are there when i need you , and i hope you know I'm there when you need me. I love you babydurl...Thanks for all the great times...And don't worrie she could never have him...not even if she would do anything...He likes you way to much for that. And i know you like him way to much too...So your just right for eachother....And he will only and always be in her dreams...lol.     &nbsp;  Well I must be going now...    &nbsp;

      If Kyle would ever ask me out I know my answer would be yes, I feel we ahve gotten so close over the past week, and i know I could never live if he hurt me in any way. But he promises that he would never hurt me like that. And I know i would never do anything to hurt him either. I know I would never want anyone to do anything like that to me again, so I know I would never do anything like that. And He is SOOOOO sweet. And I love to be with and around him. All I can do all day is think of him. And I just wish my birthday would be sooner....Well g2g...talking to Kyle.

       Today has been great, and i have had one person on my mind all day...well there are more, like brooke but Kyle has me thinking bout him, mainly because of this...    &nbsp;  Well this has been a very eventful past few days finding out that yet another girl likes me but this one is different shes not like alot of em she alot sweeter and is a true follower of the man upstairs and i aint talkin about the bumb in you attic either. Brandi you may want to know this you have a chance someday alot more than alot of the girls ever have. i might not be able to say this to you in person or even on the net but if you read this you'll know. Im not one to have secrets but sometimes its just hard for me to say what on my heart.    &nbsp;  He is so sweet...He is the perfect, or at leased as close as anyone can get to be perfect for me. I'm so happy, like i told Brookie, I just can't stop smiling. well let me know what all of you think about him...Beacuse I really like him...

       I'm very happy because, I found out that Kyle thinks we have a future. So I'm more than happy. I can't stop smiling...The only problem, and I know you all know this is that I'm not 16...And it sucks but only 4 months and 22 days to go. I can't wait...:) But till then we can get to be great friends, and we can get to know eachother more. And I know I'll love it because I love being with him, and talking to him. It will really suck when school starts...But everything will work out i just know it.

       Just hanging out here waiting on people to get home...And call or get online or something. Brookie got her tooth drilled...And filled. And she can't&nbsp;talk or she couldn't when I called her. But her mommy said that she would call me when she can talk again. So I hope she calls soon...And Kyle was at work and now is at a bowling place....I think he said holiday bowl. But I have no clue when he is getting home...And I would love for him to be home so I can talk to him...But he has his own life...And I understand that. But it is still nice to talk to him. But for now I get to be here in the house all by my self...Well my sisters are here, but they are no fun...LOL...But for now it is me and myself....Well I am really board...But I'm going to go for now...

        Well yesterday was a weird post...But I'm working on it....LOL...And right now I am ok, but I still like Kyle...And talking to him last night made me realize how much I really like him. I knew I had a crush on him, but I never really new that I really liked him...Till last night. And every time I talk to him I wish I were 16, and it really sucks that I ain't. But I just have to wait and hope that maybe when I am 16, he might come my way. I really like him...and i hope eerything works out...but for now, i guess we are friends...and that is cool.&nbsp;well i'm going to go...i can't really think of anything else for now.

        Embarrassed...I'm talking to Kyle...And now he know I like him...And I wish I were older but there ain't anything I can do anout that.&nbsp;My aunt was 16 when she met my uncle...And she said he was in his 20's. So I don't know. And I love that he beliefs in god so strongly. And...The age don't bother me but it is more or less cues I'm not the one who could get in trouble. But I know I would never do anything that would ever hurt him...Well I feel better...I'll talk to him more now...

          Well Today is so much fun...Only because I'm talking to Brooke . I can't wait till Tuesday...We are to be hanging out and watching&nbsp; My life as a teenage drama queen...Can't wait. And maybe we will hang out with Kenny and Kyle latter....Or on Wednesday or something...Maybe we can go somewhere...Who knows...Well we while all figure it out later...And I still hate her...And someone said to push her in traffic...Even though I got a good&nbsp;kick out of it I can't kill her...because Brookie likes her...LOL...So for now I let her with this thought...If you even hurt him the slightest bit I will hunt you down...He may not be my best friend any more but I like to think he is...And I will always be there for him...I still care for him so much...(friend like.) and I will not let her hurt him. He has always been there for me and I will be there for him. And Joey...I know you like Becky but I'm jealous...I don't like you like that....But&nbsp;I don't like you liking her...And Kyle...Your such a flirt...And I would love to get to know you more...Cues from what I know already I like....And I think me you Kenny, Brooke, and Kevin should go to the driven movies. Well for now I must be going...All in all this was a good day.

       dear Brandi - -   life is sooooo confuseing nemore...there is this guy that i really like..but there are things about him that i wish i could change but i don't wanna change him..cause i love him to death...but then there is his one good friend that liked confessed his love for me pretty much and i was like wow...ok when did this happen.....?......   and now its like i told the "him" the guy i like that i didn't like him...but i lied cause i'm afraid of getting hurt and also i'm afraid of letting someone else back into my heart because my heart was broken extremely bad by this prick named john..but we won't go there...   and "him" the guy i do like is wayy more experienced then i am and i'm not sure if i'm ready for that or not..if you know what i mean...so i think that is why i'm holding back from going out with him... i don't want to be pressured into something..or be tempted cause i know with him i would..and i don't want to break my strong morals that i have....and his pyscho one ex wants to kill me ...but thats just GAY!!! its like you know girl you have a freaking boyfriend so don't you think you should worry about him cheating on you instead on my love life...god your ex HATES you...he never wanted you..you were just some freaking whore ...god....   i hate this life of mine...  just cause i say something doesn't mean i really mean it..  if i like a guy i tell him that i don't like him so i won't get hurt..its easier then putting your heart on the line.... i just hate heartbreak...   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       It is like 11:00 and brooke is here...and we were at the park thingy, (fair) and kyle and his brother were there...(Kevin.) We were hanging out and having fun...but my Brookie goted upset cuz kenny didn't pay attention to her...but it is all good cuz i&nbsp;love her....and so does kyle...(sniker - sniker) I think Kenny is just a big ass-hole. But i can't say to&nbsp;much cuz i don't really know him. I thought i likes kyle and i do but i know nothing will happen...i think that is weird but that is how i am...and Kevin seems really sweet...man i wish i was 16...:(&nbsp; . I hate that Darren is going out with Casey and it isn't that i like him but i'm jelus...not cuz i want to go out with him just that i don't want a friend hurt out of it all...he to sweet to be hurt again. I think Brookie should go out with him...she and i were having an argument over it cuz she said that Darren was HOTTER...but i think Joey is ... Any way he can do way better than her. EW...i hate her.

       Things are weird...Everything can change in just a few minutes...And when you hear something it shock you because you know the people....But you don't really talk to them...Maybe you had a class with them or maybe you knew there cousin or you just see them walking in the halls and you know who they are but don't talk to them....But then when something happens to them there is a big fuss....And they are dyeing or just pulling throughout, or even could die any minute.....And you think this really sucks...Why did something like this half to happen to people so young....Why is the only thing on your mind....And you can still pray for the others....We all know that Matt Lewis was taken from the world. And yes it really sucks, but there were 3 left to be taken care of and we all need to pray for them, and we need to pray that matt will be taken to a better place, and pray for all those that were hurt by what happened...I know that Vince is hurting because, he and matt were really good friends, matt taught him how to wresal....And Candace is really good friends with Zack, she is so worried about him....Kevin and matt were really good friends, I don't really know how good but Kyle said that they were really close...And for everyone else that knew them god bless you and pray for all the others....This Whole Post Goes Out To       Matt         Dustin         Zack         Lynn         And Everyone Tat Is grieving....         God Bless You All.....

I need to call Brookie cuz I haven't talked to her in a few days so I need to call her and see what is up with her....And it really don't bother me with your whole flirting think Kyle...Cuz I love you and I know you Love me so i forgive you and I'm not bothered by it....    Lizzy's Birthday party is tonight...(the one with the family...Last night was with her friends, and all they did was fight) and the family is coing over...so it will be a little boring, but still fun.

       Today was different...I went to bed at 2:30 and got up at 5:00...Then I went out for breakfast and then I came home and fell asleep till like 11:00. Then I went up to my grams and came home at 9:30. And got on the putter hoping Kyle would be on. But he wasn't, But Kevin was and I'm talking to him. And Laura...:)      Kyle said he loved me yesterday...I was so happy, I kept thinking do I or not. Do I love him or just really like him....But I knew that I did love him when he said it and I could say it back without even thinking....I was so happy.       I;m so happy now because, Kyle just got on. I really didn't think I would get to talk to I'm tonight... And he said that he text me a message that said I miss you ... :( and I love you....awa...Isn't he just so sweet...I love him. HE is the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me. I couldn't live my life without him...      Kyle, I love you. You are the one that I will always need you can't change my heart....You will always fill me with the best thoughts and the happiness I need.       Brookie, Your my girl I'm sorry I didn't vcall you today I just didn't get the time...I'll call you tomorrow....Sorry hunni...I love ya babydurl
