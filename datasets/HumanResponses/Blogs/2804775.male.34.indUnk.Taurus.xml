       Day 5   Looking forward to the weekend.............   Last Night  Went out last night to dinner at a small Italian place. Pretty good pizza for Taiwan but nothing special. Waitress was extremley cute but English was a challenge for her.  After dinner, we went to Carnegies for some drinks with the Product introduction team & 2 local Taiwanese co-workers. Considering this is supposed to be one of the most hip bars in Taipei, it was very dissapointing. There was only a small amount of people there and it was completley lacking in atmosphere. I guess Wed (Ladies night), Fri & Sat are the only hip nights. Kary came over and joined us for a couple of drinks. Now my co-workers in Taiwan are aware that my girlfriend is a local..... watch this space  Back to the hotel and a quick stop off at Ziga Zaga, an extremley over priced club on the 1st floor of the hotel. Live band has improved since the last time I was there however the place was not exactly busy. Looks like most of the girls dancing could have been hookers. It is hard to tell here.........  Closed out the night with a bit of an argument with Kary over some stupid shit. She needs to understand that I am not here for a vacation but really here to work. This girl is really un-willing to compromise and needs everything her way. Girls in Taiwan are just like any others I have been with in the past.  C'est La Vie

       Day 3 - Reality Sets In......    Work....  The situation is becoming worse with the Customer. We are struggling to pass Mini Environment tests on our tools. The Customer has expressed his dis-satisfaction and demanded that we pass the test or he will no longer talk with us until we do. The typical communication issues between all the parties involved is as expected. It is almost like the headless chicken syndrome. Engineers are everywhere (Customer, Account Team, Loan Labor & External Test Engineers). No-one can provide a detailed synopsis, I guess that is where TPS need to step in and manage the situation.  Small glimmer of hope today is that we have some good preliminary data on one of our tools. If we can double confirm this unexpected good result we will move on to next step and perform the official test tomorrow. If we are successful, we will fan out to other tools.    Evening Plans....  The Local Account team have a Chinese New Year party planned for tonight. We have been invited to partake in the festivities. Should be some Chinese style food followed by some beers then back to the hotel for some shut eye.   Tomorrow Is A New Day...  I will be checking out of the local hotel in TaoYuan and planning to move to a better hotel in Taipei tomorrow evening after work. We have already planned dinner & drinks in Taipei where the nightlife is 100x better than TaoYuan.

       Day 2  - Typical day in Taiwan.......    Work......  Meet Account Team.... Meet Customer.... Meet with Vendor that is fucking up our progress and pissing off our Customer, thus pissing me off.  Meet Customer again and inform them of previous mentioned Vendors feeble action plan to resolve their issues.  Take multiple action items from Customer and promise resolution within the week. Time to get busy.....  Send multiple e-mails requesting information / help / more information from the Product Group back in California. Drop off some update voicemails to California on our latest status in Taiwan.  Leave Office at 7.00pm (it is good to be alive).....   Evening Plans.......  Take 30 minute taxi trip back to hotel. The main question on my mind is best way to resolve the jetlag. I know from past experience that this will require an infusion of multiple beers as quickly as possible. This is a sure fire way I know I will get a sustained unbroken sleep.  Head out to local bar (Rodeo) in TaoYuan. Very strange place... An Australian bar (with taiwanese style) that sells Tex-Mex food. There are oficially 5 punters at the bar when I arrive with a co-worker (Tom, also from California). There are however 7 bar staff so ordering drinks are very simple and fast. We order some food which was very acceptable and wash it down with multiple bottles of Corona and a couple of 12 year old malt whiskies. This bar is very small but will definitley end up in the rotation should I venture back to this place again.  Towards the end of the evening, we watch the bar staff whip some (new to Taiwan) punters at silly drinking games. These games are typically dice, cards or connect 4. A loss normally results in you having to buy them a shot. These folks are pros at these silly little drinking games and the art of drinking multiple shots without passing out or loosing their dinners. They will easlily out win and out drink the punters. These are not games of chance but a simple method to part the punter from his cash as quickly as possible. Luckilly I have learned from past mistakes and do not entertain these little drinking games anymore. By past mistakes, I mean dropping lots of cash and working with the worst possible hangovers I can ever remember.  Back to hotel and mission accomplished. One solid night of sleep..........

       Day 1   Inotera is one very impressive Fab. These folks are not messing around and this is one huge manufacturing facility soon to be filled out with multi milion dollar equipment churning out 300mm DRAM wafers. In all my trips to Asia, this is probably one of the largest factories I have ever seen.  Well I managed to get out of work, drop my laptop off at the hotel and make my way towards Taipei. This is no small feat as it took 2 taxi rides, 2 train rides and 2 trips on the Taipei MRT. Not many people in Taiwan working in the transport business are fluent in English and the signs are just as bad.  For a first major attempt like that, I am certainly most impressed....... Got to have dinner with my girlfriend Kary at a mediocre eatery in Taipei. Even better the fact that she was also stunned I made it from TaoYuan all the way to Taipei without freaking out.  During the 14 hour trip to Taiwan, I read.... virtually non stop. I am not an avid reader however I want to point out 2 books I have completed so far on this trip.   1. Dude Where Is My Country - Michael Moore  I have heard many people, mostly Republicans call bullshit on the thoughts of Michael Moore (A raving democrat I think was the typical comment). I have no political beliefs in the US primarily because I don't have a vote (& quite rightly so). I will keep my political thoughts focused around issues in the UK, especially Scotland where my heart and soul continues to lie. This said however, Michael Moore has raised several points that if true stun me to my central core.   2. The Rape of Nanking - Iris Chang  I knew somewhat of the alleged atrocities to happen to the Chinese during the 2nd World War. I was not big into history in school; in fact I went out of my way not to listen in school to 3 subjects (1) Art - Boring, (2) History - Even More Boring & (3) French - Well its just French.  Even though I was not really listening, I know the situation that was reported in Nanking was not taught in the UK. I guess because it may reduce the impact of the Holocaust, which is taught throughout Europe.  Basically the Japanese army very quickly defeated the Chinese in a most humiliating fashion. The local Chinese women were allegedly raped, kidnapped into brothels and further abused by the soldiers. Many many of these women it is claimed, died a terrible and horrible death. In all, more than 300,000 lives were lost in Nanking..... In only a matter of weeks!!!.  This book is riveting in its horror and detail and shows further evidence that virtually all nations, at some point in their history, have comitted horrendous acts against our fellow man.

       Prologue  Well welcome to 2004. It is now around 8.00pm (pacific time) however in local time I am now at approx 12.00 noon in Taiwan. I am on a 3 week business trip to the island of Taiwan, locally known as Farmosa (Beautiful Island). The weather is fairly poor right now, infact it has been pissing of rain since I arrived last night. Beautiful island my ass!!!  Happy Chinese New Year! - Celebration of the Year of the Monkey!!   urlLink TSMC New Year E-Card    Rant Alert!    The department of Homeland Security can officially bite me! I was pissed when my suitcase appeared at the baggage claim area held together with bits of string and clear adhesive tape. I was even more pissed when I discovered a nice propoganda leaflet inside telling me that they are not liable for opening suitcases with a freakin crowbar and any damage resulting from any inspections. What the fuck happened here? Can these fuckwits not open your case without using a crowbar to rip off the lock? Where is our leading edge technology now? Did we hire a bunch of fucking morons to run our security?   Rant Over!  The jetlag has just started to kick in. After my 14 hour cramped flight on EVA Airlines and feeble attempt at obtaining sleep last night, I officially feel like shit. Some beer shouldl help with the jetlag later tonight, if I venture out for some refreshments.  Well, I need to go visit my Latest Customer in Taiwan. Inotera is a joint venture 300mm DRAM Semiconductor fabrication facility between Infineon (Germany) and Nanya (Taiwan). We have multiple 300mm Etch systems currently being installed and as the Technical Product Support Representative for Taiwan, I need to go see how the land lies........ Have fun and keep reading urlLink

       Day 12    Tainan  Stayed at the Tayih Landis hotel in Tainan for 2 days (very nice 5 start hotel with great facilities) and visited with TSMC Fab6 and UMC Fab 12. The TSMC meeting went well on Wednesday and the main focus was spare parts deliveries and the usual Customer complaints about our Vendors parts quality. The UMC meeting on Thursday was a bit of an eye opener!!!!. The Customer was very cordial however there was some very strong underlying messages of extreme dis-satisfaction. I took multiple actions as the Account team folded and brought nothing to the table. The Customer is making demands that can't be met. It seems that they do not ubderstand technically how our systems operate.  Did manage to get the Customer Acceptance docs signed but this is a small achievement and pales in comparason to the Engineering demands we need to respond to...... I have 2 weeks to present an action plan for 2 key issues and I already know I am fighting a lose lose situation....... watch this space for fireworks and the usual lack of action from our local support in Tainan.   Get the hell out of Dodge........NOW!  Decided to not deal with the horrible taxi ride back north and promptly purchased a flight on Far Eastern Air Transport back to Taipei. This is a 1 hour flight and I had forgot how dangerous a local flight within Taiwan can be. The planes are maybe maintained (or maybe not..I submit not!) Last time I flew with these guy's it was not all that bad. This time I realised quickly that any weird bump or strange noise resulted in a look of sheer terror on the faces of the very inept flight attendants.... I fly multiple times all over the world on business but have never seen this level of panic from a so called profesional crew. If the crew looks worried I guess you should also. I wonder what they knew and were not telling us.  Next time will be a bus trip or taxi trip for sure.........  Arrived safe in Taipei but it took a couple of hours before the color returned to my nuckles and I can now move my fingers freely again.  I need some beers.......Thank God it is Friday!

       Day 10    Work continues.....  Bussed it back to Hsin-Chu on Sunday evening with Kary. Checked into the Ambassador hotel for 2 nights. Just enough time to catch up on the latest from our folks based in Hsin-chu but no time to meet any actual Customers. Discussed with one Account the extremley long time taking to get the Customer to accept our equipment and officially sign the Customer Acceptance Criteria. These guys are clearly fucking up. Most other Accounts & Customers in Taiwan drag it out to ~90 days. This particular Account & Customer are averaging 150 days and I am getting my "Arse Felt" on a daily basis because of them. Time to get tough... Plan is to produce the data showing their poor performance as compared to others and try to embarrass them into some form of action.  Had a nice dinner at the Pig & Whistle on Monday night. Jessica was not working behind the bar (God I hate that bitch!) so I guess the food tasted better than normal. The reason I hate Jessica is a long and boring one that I should not really go into, however the basics areas follows:  A. She in a round about way caused a scene when one of my co-workers put his arm around her one night at the bar as he offered to buy her a drink. B. One of her Canadian Chinese friends went berzerk and started trying to kick previoiusly mentioned co-worker in the head, while screaming she is not a hooker. C. I obsereve this funny scene from the dance floor and once I stop laughing at Adam getting almost beat up by a 110lb girl, I go to try and calm things down.   Bad, Bad Move.....   D. I am now part of this farce for trying to help said co-worker.  E. The story breaks that I was in trouble that night and Jessica does nothing to correct the story.............           Jessica Bite Me!!!!!   Tuesday afternoon headed down to Tainan in the south of Taiwan. I had to attend some meetings with Two major Customers in the Area on Wed & Thurs. Initial plan is to fly out of here on Thursday evening and get back to Taipei. Hope to spend Friday at Inotera as I need to get atleast 1 full week in Hsin-Chu to close out with all our Regional Accounts

       Weekend Posts - Day 7    Sunday  Woke up at around 11.30 and went and had brunch at a local shopping mall, followed by Starbucks then off to an electronics show at the conference centre next to the Hyatt hotel. The show was really busy and the typical Taiwanese way of just barging past you was in full effect. The folks here are not known for being patient and will climb up your back to get past you if you slow down to look at some display.  Some random girls wearing very skimpy clothes were the highlight of the day.... Damn I forgot my camera.  Had dinner at a small Mongolian BBQ then jumped on the bus to Hsin-Chu. I should spend most of the week there catching up with our other Customers. Also planning to visit Tainan to meet with UMC and TSMC Fab 6 later in the week.   Saturday  Woke up with a major hangover at 12.00. Decided to stay in bed for a couple more hours....... Went to lunch with Kary and then met up with Tom at Starbucks for coffee. Tonight we eat dinner at a small Indian place and then went to CKS memorial in central Taipei to check out the Lantern festival. This is a huge festival that marks the 15th day of the Lunar new year. All the schools make these lanterns that are displayed around the outskirts of the very impressive CKS memorial hall. This is a mojor picture opportunity. Headed back to hotel around 11.00pm and decided to have an early night. Tom & Ric will venture out to Carnegies for some beers and "window shopping" but is turns out to be a quiet night for all.   Friday Night  Kary takes myself & Tom to a local hot pot shop.... In Taiwan when it gets abnormally cold, everyone wants to eat hot pot. It is basically a pot with hot water that you use to cook various vegetables, meats, seafood and animal parts (We will not discuss anything like intestines or duck blood....WTF!). The hot pot actually turns out to be very tasty and the dipping sauce starts of just nice and spicy but soon turns evil and is virtually un-edible. I soldier on but true to form, Tom has added as much chilli as he can and is now in pain with every bite. Tom is known for eati ng some of the spicyest shit on this planet. He was clearly out done tonight.  Finished dinner then took a taxi to an Irish bar called Shannon. This place is only 1-2 years old and has a fairly good chinese band playing known as the rubber band. The band was much better than the typical cover band here but they should not have tried Bohemian Rhapsody. I guess there are not many people could pull that one off. The pints of Guiness are good here..... definite plus.......... Kary has invited her friend Sandy to come out with us to a club later. Tom is clearly impressed when Sandy shows up at the bar and promptly spills a beer as he puts on his jacket. We leave to go to Roxy Vibe, a smallish club that opens at 1.00am.   Tom and Sandy seem to hit it off and have several tours of the dance floor. I can't dance but damn Tom is worse than me. People were lucky not to loose an eye or two......  Vibe was fairly empty when we arrived but it was filling up by 5.00 when we decided to leave. I was fairly drunk and ofcourse this lead to the inevitable arguments with Kary back at the hotel because I was smoking un-detected at the club........ Damn she is becoming a pain in my ass.  Another cold night in Taipei..............

       5.00pm in Taiwan...... Still feel like shit!   Thought I would start to feel better after lunch but this hangover is not lifting. Plan to leave the office soon and take a taxi back to the hotel, catch 1 hour nap and then go for dinner with my girlfriend Kary. After talking to her earlier, I have some work to do. Looks like she is angry with me because I got drunk last night and as always we ended up in a silly argument because I was not paying her 110% attention.   Bad Bad Bad Derek..............   I suspect she will lighten up tonight as I fly home tomorrow, maybe need to buy her something to put a smile back on her face

       My Head Hurts!!!   Last night I ate Thai food at a little place in Taipei called Very Thai. This is the best Thai food I have ever encountered.... Very spicy but incredible. I made the mistake of chewing a nuclear chilli that was hidden in the soup and lost the function of my mouth for approximately 45 mins. Only solution was to follow up with multiple bottles of Grolsh at the Brass Monkey.  For haning out in Taipei, I recommend the following schedule:  Wed Night - Carnegies (Ladies Night) Thu Night - Brass Monkey (Ladies Night) Fri Night - Shannon or Carnegies followed by Roxy Vibe until 5.00am Sat Night - Roxy 99 followed by Roxy Vibe until 5.00am  The Brass Monkey was full to the brim with Taipei's most attractive women last night. Music was good and the beer is reasonably cheap.  Sitting in the office catching up on e-mails.......... My God, my head still hurts!

       Day 17   Almost time to head back home to Sunnyvale.... Thank God! [Saturday can't come fast enough!!]  Car still  having battery problems and an overnight trickle charge was not enought to get it back up and running. Hopefully my friend from work (Joe) will manage to get her running again before I return on Saturday.  Checked out of the Royal Hotel in Hsin-Chu and am now back in my 2nd home, or spiritual home if you like.... Taipei   Work  Still many issues to work through. It is very clear that business is picking up again and for Taiwan alone, we should remain very busy over the next 6-9 months. This is going to require lots of trips here for everyone within my group at work. Most folks are happy to travel happy to travel here but some definitley appreciate it more than others.........   Heard a strong rumor that Tom finally talked himself into a full blown Asian massage (Legitamite type...No Slags or Hookers involved). Having had 2 or 3 propper massages here in the past, im sure he feels like a new man although he may look like he has been severley beaten. Extreme bruising is very typical but oh my god once you get past the initial pain, you feel 10 years younger.   I have a mad craving for a good pint of guiness..... just can't shake it. May have to hit the Shannon in Taipei tonight or tomorrow night before I come home. Failing that, I will have to venture out to Fibbar McGees in Sunnyvale upon my arrival home.   Weird Alert!  Kary's mother visited her in Hsin-Chu last night and we all had dinner. I counted at least 3 times in the chinese conversation (which I can only pick out small points) where the question of marraige came up. How do I know this considering Lai Ma Ma can't speak English...... She whistled the wedding march while pointing to Kary and then me. My immediate feeble answer....... Maybe! [Hopefully maybe translates to not in a million years]  Maybe....WTF! (2 years ago, I would have been running down the street to change my flight and get the hell out of this mad hole..... I must be mellowing but I know for sure I will only get married on my terms, which likely means this will not happen in the immediate future.  I know that me stonewalling and ignoring them is no longer working. This family want me to marry their youngest daughter now [not tomorrow, not next week, not next year... but NOW!]  I need to get my running shoes on.................byeeeeeeeeeee

       BMW's   I am lucky to be the owner of a 1999 BMW M3 coupe [or so I thought]  My car was supposed to be dropped off at a local shop for some repairs during my trip to Taiwan.... (thanks to Joe for helping me out)  Engine Warning Light - Suspect O2 Sensor needs replaced ABS / ASC Warning Light - Potential pump issue or wiring issue. Light was intermittant now on 100%  I guesss the internal SW on the management system has kicked in to generate revenue for BMW now that the warranty is up.................  Now the battery has as much life in it as Odai & Qusai Hussein. The doors will not open, Alarm will not switch off or even the Engine will not start. I leave this car idle for 2 weeks and it has packed up and died on me.   RIP.... it was fun!   BMW = Fun car to drive, Great looking car = High maintenance cost   More on this later

       Day 15    Hotel Scams.....  Over the last year, we have had some un-official hotel scams running in Taiwan. The hotels are so desparate to get your, and your companies business, they will construct these deals to entice you away from the other hotels. Last year we had a deal that the Lakeshore Hotel would provide you one free dinner for every week stayed at the hotel. In addition to this, they would also give you 500NT in coupons for a local shopping mall (Sogo) for each night stayed. Word spread about this deal very rapidly and it was not long before our local office in Taiwan put the axe through that deal.    Why should our employees get a little fringe benefit when working in a hot sweaty hostile environment?   Well folks... I just discovered that the Hsin-Chu Royal Hotel has just replaced the Lakeshore as the hotel of choice. 200NT coupon for the hotel restaurant for each night plus 500NT coupon for the Windance shopping mall for each night stayed.  Lets put this into perspective... Last year during the course of my business travel to Taiwan, I purchased a Sony DV Camcorder for the pricley sum of $0. Yes zero, zip, nadda..........not bad for a $700 camcorder.  Unfortunatley this deal will expire in June but Im sure there will be another....... with the current exchange rate, 500NT is equivalent to around $15 so if I manage to maintain my composure and continue to deal with our Taiwanese Customers and Local Account team's [without losing my mind], I guess I will be able to purchase a 50cc scooter in close to 5 years...........   Love Actually....  I saw this movie last night. While some of it was slightly amusing, it was a bit slow and I felt let down from the hype I had heard here. Best thing Hugh Grant has achieved in the last 10 years is a bang at Liz Hurley and a quick BJ in tha back of a car in LA. His nervous Englishman character is wearing thin... Go on Hugh learn how to act!

       Day 14    Nice Weather in Taipei  Spent Friday at the local office in Linkou, catching up on the progress at our latest Customer. Found out that I was unable to send e-mail as my company e-mail box was 150Meg over the limit. Had to spend 3 hours archiving important e-mails in an effort to get back to a managable inbox size. The server in Taiwan is 10x slower than the one in the US.....maybe thats why it takes so long to get shit done here  The weather has definitley picked up and now we have lots of sunshine... no more bland rainy days.  Friday night went to eat dinner with Kary at a new bar called the Brass Monkey. It is owned by an Australian thus they have multiple beers available. Food was not too bad. Met up with Tom, Craig, Ric, David, Manfred & Steve (All Co-Workers from the US) and had a few beers before they headed off to carnegies for some sniffing. With Kary in toe, I headed off to Roxy 99 for a quick beer just to show Tom the place. He then headed of to meet the other guys at Carnegies. I opted for a quick taxi trip back to the the Hyatt.   Valentines Day  Had a slow relaxing day and spent some time with Kary. We met last January but really only went out during Valentines Day last year so I guess this is a special day for her even though the Chinese celebrate Chinese Valentines day much later in the year..... This way the Chinese get two days where the unfortunate guy is parted from his cash in a very efficient manner. Typically dinner will cost 2-3x more than normal. I remember last year eating at Trader Vic's with Kary only to find out around desert time that it was going to run me $100 each. If there is any advice I can give....... Check the price for set menus before eating, especially on Valentines day.  Ate a quick lunch and walked around Taipei a little.  Had dinner at a small Italian place (Papa Giovanni's). Food was very good but service was extremley slow. 2 hours into the dinner, we were just starting the main course........ I remember previously when visiting Millan, that dinner was an all evening affair. We really had a nice night and decided to just chill out at the hotel and forego the late night pub fest that is Taipei.   Sunday Sunday Sunday  Met up with all the lads again and had lunch at JUKE's (Jakes Urban Kitchen), a small Mexican place that sells all day breakfast. Food is fairly good but the place is small. Craig & Tom were looking for a cigar so we hit one of the shopping malls then Starbucks just to chill out. Kary went home to take care of her laundry so I headed off with Tom to the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen memorial hall. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen was the first provisional president of the Republic of China. The memorial hall is an impressive sight in the middle of the busy capitol of Taiwan. The local people seem to spend weekend afternoons there, in an effort to get away from the major city madness like traffic and overcrowding.  took the bus back to Hsin-Chu and booked into the Hsin-Chu Royal hotel......

       God Damn It! - Why Can't I Sleep?   Left work last night dazed, confused and completley out of sync. The small amount of sleep I got the night before was not enough to maintain a decent level of responsiveness from my brain.  Had to force myself to stay awake in an attempt at sleeping through the night. Started to panic around 10.30pm when I felt my body waking up again. Decided to make an attempt at sleep before the clouds moved from my head, that would surley mean lying awake staring at the roof.  Out like a light........ Wake up at 12.30am [Fuck!]  Wide awake, I switch on my PC and surf the net for a while then decide to start editing some video I took while in Taiwan.    2.00am - Sleep attempt #2   As I lie in bed looking at the celing I really need to paint, I am becoming more and more agitated as I know tomorrow at work is going to be tough. I consider my options......  Calm down.... relax!  Must have dropped off to sleep again around 3 or 3.30am. Wake up before alarm goes off at 7.30am. No point fighting anymore. I got ready and left for work.  Extreme tiredness is coming on strong already and it is only just after 10.30am. I need to see this day out and hopefully get a full nights sleep tonight.

       Home Again!   I am happily back in beautiful California. That was one of the longer trips I have made to Taiwan and it was very busy. Overall, I still had the chance to relax a little in the evenings and weekends.  I spent all of Friday night with Kary as it was my last night. We had dinner at the Taipei Hooters (The girls working in Taiwan are definitley not as proportioned as the girls in the US or Europe so I find it amusing the place is still called hooters - should really be "Almost Hooters"). After dinner we went to see a movie...   The Last Samurai  I thought this was a great movie, some good fight scenes and the movie fits in perfectly with the way I view Japanese culture in terms of morals, honor,history and most importantly pride. Tom Cruise being an extreme over actor takes a little away from this move and I found it un believeable that he picked up the Japanese language so quickly during the span of the movie. I know its just a movie......  Saturday I went to eat sushi with Kary & Tom for lunch, followed by Starbucks for the daily coffee infusion. Back to the hotel, picked up my gear and headed for the airport.  Flight back to LA on EVA was fairly un eventful even though it was full of a Vietnamese tourist group. Tourist groups tend not to respect your personal space and on multiple occasions, I had the brother of the couple next to me almost sitting in my freakin lap. I guess I should have given him my seat but he was supposed to sit next to the back toilets... Fuck that I decided to grin and bear the inconvenience of him invading my space.  Well thas all folks..... back to normallity!

       Friday  Looking forward to this weekend. This was one  pain-in-the-arse  week at work. The quest for Customer Acceptance for the recent tools installed in Taiwan intensifies..........  BMW made it to the garage to be checked out for Engine Check light, ABS Check light and ASC Check light. Got the bad news... 2 O2 Sensors required, Some pulley bearings [good Fan & AC were getting noisey] and the kicker....The ABS pump is fucked.  Estimate=$3500...... Bollocks!   Weekend Plan  Friday Night - there is a party held in honor of Joey Pero [Soloist Extrordinaire - Empire Statesman] who has been hanging out with the Renegades in California and is due to return to the East Coast on Saturday. Joe is an all round good lad and one hell of a soprano player, he also has one hell of an ego but he deserves it. The party will be at Gilman's house and Im sure it will be fun. I hope I can make it even though I am officially car-less at this point in time.   Saturday / Sunday  Besides relaxing, which I do enjoy... I plan on starting to paint the house. I will begin with the en-suite bathroom followed by the bedroom ceiling followed by the wood trim followed by the walls. With all the relaxation time I also plan on, should be finished in about 2 months..... joking!  I feel like some beers.....

       New Home PC  Well I finally got the chance to sit down and build a new PC. My old one [built 2-3 years ago] has been sick now for some time and with the addition of a cool Sony DV Camcorder to my list of toys, I was really needing to update my PC specs somewhat.  Bought a Shuttle XPC, 3.2GHz P4, 160Gig Serial ATA HD, Sony DVD+/- R / RW and 1Gig Ram.  Assembly and configuration a breeze. Software insallation progressed well but definite hang up issues with Finale 2003 [Music Software] and problems setting up a home network to transfer all my larger files to my new PC.   Finale issue due to hyperthreading compatibility. Resolved by manually fixing the program compatibility mode to Win 98 / ME.  Network issue resolved after removing the built in Windows XP firewall.   Renegades  Sat at work this morning listening to the MP3's from the camp at the weekend. Damn this corps rocks! The quality of the corps has jumped up a notch or two and we are now at almost a contender level. Most of the vibe on the internet newsgroups to the MP3's has been great. We continue to built our fan base and turn it up at the same time.   Fuck I am pissed I had to miss the Sunday rehearsal.   Renegades Mini-Corps  We have a rehearsal tonight at SCV hall. We are working on two charts (1.) Channel One Suite & (2.) When A Man Loves A Woman. Both are Blue Devils arrangements and the goal is to get the group on an up-and-coming Blue Devils Alumni CD, that features former members gone professional.  Very Cool, I will be playing in a group on a Blue Devils CD.......

       Renegades Camp Weekend    Saturday   The day started off with a slow drive to Treasure Island for a 10.00am til 9.00pm rehearsal. Really bad crash on 101 with a SUV lying on its roof in the centre lanes (I hope the driver and passengers got out safe!)  Having a sore knee [resulting from recent 14 hour flights] I skipped stretch and caught up a little with my old friend Clint. After stretching, the entire brass line [about 61 in attendance] headed off to the concrete parking lot for basics and then onto the actual drill. In  all we worked through about 14 or 15 sets during the late morning and afternoon blocks.  The evening block was mostly technique work with John Mehan and some detailing of Part 1 & the Ballad. Drum line joined for ensemble to run Part 1. This music is very very intense ans is sure to please the crowd at DCA. I hope we can successfully pull of a surprise at DCA and jump more spots. The Drum line are jamming and the addition of Scott Johnson to the staff is showing great benefit already.   Sunday  Unfortunatley I had to skip rehearsal today to prepare for work. It is difficult supporting Taiwan, in that they are 16 hours ahead. This means that my work week really starts on Sunday afternoon but the expected bonus of an easy Friday never really happens. In this Industry, most companies work round the clock.

       Friday  Not much has went on this week besides me spending lots of cash!  Car is now fixed at a typical BMW rate [$3500], still on-board with the house painting, Property tax is a bitch!, Car Insurance is a bitch! Credit Card is a Bitch!   Renegades Mini-Corps  We have a rehearsal on Saturday morning in Concord in preparation for our recording session on Sunday. Monday night rehearsal went well and we should be done in a couple of takes.   Up & Coming Business Trips  Well Im heading off to Taiwan again... very soon. Don't know the exact details yet but if i was available, I would have been on a plane yesterday. Looks like I will be able to avoid it until the end of the month.

       Sunday Evening  Unfortunately I did not make the party on friday night. Not having a car sucks!  Dropped about $500 at OSH. Had to buy some paint, a ladder, powered roller and other implements to help my DIY project come to fruition.  Actually made progress on the painting front. Managed to complete the bathroom however the bedroom ceiling is proving more difficult than first anticipated. The ceiling in my bedroom is vaulted and extremley high. After a difficult day [sore muscles] and running out of paint, I decided to give it up until another weekend. I did however manage to complete about 1/2 of the ceiling. Oh well, I should be finished by the summer........

       Monday Blues  Back at work already... Why does the weekend fly past at almost warp speed?   Saturday  Had a rehearsal with the Renegades Mini-Corps at Clayton Valley High School in Concord in preparation for our recording session on Sunday. Channel One Suite was sounding really good.  Made the 1 hour drive back home to invest more money at Orchard. I bought a crafstman tool chest and a roll away set of drawers. Just need to buy some tools to fill it out with. Back home and on with the DIY painting project. Managed to get the bedroom ceiling completed in about 2 hours.  Next week I should get the bedroom finished............... watch this space   Sunday  Drove up to Los Medonos College in Pittsburg for the recording session. The session was run by Frank Dorrite [grammy award winning producer] who runs the recording arts department and incidentially also works with the Renegades full corps. Frank is an old time Drum Corps guy and one hell of a soprano player.  The session went well. I was very surprised that we recorded in chucks that will be pieced together later in the studio. Most of the time was spent on Channel One Suite where we focussed on the chart in 3 or 4 sections. When A Man Loves A Woman was easier to get done and it took 3 or 4 takes to get it down.  I can't wait to hear how this CD sounds but we had several bad ass soprano players screaming throughout both charts. Should be a good one for the archives.

       Friday Evening  Last couple of days have been nothing but good news:  1. Completed bedroom painting today. Very impressed with the results 2. Got a promotion at work with a fairly descent pay increase 3. May qualify for extra stock options  Thats about it. Still heading out to Taiwan on Sunday for an arrival 5.50am Local time on Tuesday morning. Need to get a good sleep on the plane and hit the ground running.   Renegades  Camp is on this weekend at a high school in Santa Clara [10 mins max from my home]. Treasure island has been a great rehearsal site but I won't miss the 1 hour drive each way. At least I will make the Saturday portion before heading to Asia. Looking forward to see how much progression will be made this camp.  That all folks

       Monday Again!  Well another week has flown past at near warp speed. Week at work was boring, un-inspiring and downright depressing. I have to go to Taiwan again on the 28th and it irks me that it will cause me to miss the Sunday portion of rehearsal with the Renegades again this coming weekend.   St Patricks Day  At work on Wednesday I was so bored out of my skull, I made the decision to head out to one of the local Irish bars for the St Paddy's celebrations. Several co-workers were also heading out so I figured it would be a good night. Fibbar Magees [Local Bar] was packed solid and serving Guiness in plastic glasses much to my disgust. Spent the night talking to some folks I worked with at NEC Semiconductors in Scotland. It was good to catch up a little. Mark & Audrey worked with Lam Research, Derek worked with KLA but is now with Lam Research and I worked with Applied Materials [Still currently with them but based obviously in the US]. We were all equipment vendors at NEC and collectivley we were treated with the utmost disregard and dis-respect possible. I had forgotten many of the stories but they all came flooding back.   Weekend  Spent the entire weekend decorating the master bedroom. I am in complete agony today... my arms, knees, shoulders and neck feel like I have been severley beaten but hey... I'm making progress.  4 doors now painted white, ceiling is completely painted white and all wood trim is painted white. Closet has the walls & ceiling completed and 2 walls in the bedroom are done. All the difficult work is done so I should be able to finish before I head out to Taiwan again on Sunday. I may take Friday off of work and get it done in one final swoop.  I am very impressed with the way things are looking. To be honest, the house was in very good shape when I bought it, but the new paint takes it to another level. I am already planning to move onto the 2nd-3rd floor stairs / hallway or the 1st-2nd floor stairs / hallway next.  Anyway folks.... back to work

       Day 3 - Hsin-Chu  Well I am slowly getting over the jetlag and getting back on track. Yesterday was spent dealing with TSMC and I attended a Key Supplier Productivity meeting hosted by TSMC. This was an unusual meeting in that it was attended by very high level VP's from both TSMC and our Company. Our product group did not have to present however I was asked to attend just incase some related questions came up.  Luckilly for me, no such questions were raised so it was a 2 1/2 hour waste of time.  Tuesday night I went to the Pig & whistle bar in Hsin-chu for dinner. The food there is fairly good and I also had a couple of coronas to wash down dinner along with some co-workers.  Last night I was on my own for dinner because of the delayed end of the KSP meeting. After a very scary taxi trip back to the hotel in which the driver drove down the wrong side of a dual carriage way road because the side we were supposed to be on was backed up with traffic. While I appreciated his attempt to get me to my destination quicker, I was immediatley alarmed when he started weaving in and out of on-coming traffic. This quick trip down nightmare lane was maybe only for 2-3 minutes however it felt like a millenium and luckilly we made it to the hotel with no issues. Once I calmed down, I ventured out to the Flying Pig for dinner [all of the reasonable western style bars in Hsin-chu have the word pig in their names]. Had a quick spicy pork sandwich, a couple of coronas and headed back to the hotel. I planned on a good nights sleep to finally kick my jetlag in the ass and that was accomplished.  This morning in the taxi ride to the office, I shared the taxi story from last night just as we were about to pull out onto the same road. As the taxi driver looked to the left and pulled out...... SMACK!!!!... CRASH!!!! ....Oh Shit!!!!!. The taxi driver broadsided a little Taiwanese girl driving her scooter the wrong way down the same street that my nightmare occurred on, the previous evening. I watched as she shot up in the air, pulled off a couple of artistic summersaults and hit the ground beside her mangled scooter. She was on her feet very quickly and on the phone, I suspect to the police. I feel sorry for the taxi driver because she was clearly in the wrong however the word in Taiwan is that if you hit a scooter, you are at fault no matter what the situation. The driver either realised or suspected this was going to be a tough situation so he flagged down a replacement ride and we were on our way to the office while the driver inspected the damage to his ride.  So thats about all the exitement for the last couple of days..... More coming soon

       Day 1 - Taiwan  Well I arrived safely in Taiwan at 5.50am, exactly on scheduled time even though we left about an hour or so late. Flight was fairly uneventful although I did mamage to get about 6 hours sleep. Sleeping on a plane is normally not something I pull off well however on this flight I was lucky, maybe it was because there was an empty seat next to me.    Recommendation  -  Do not lock your suitcase if travelling on an airline. Best way is to buy one of those straps that secures your case closed and it can easily be removed by the fuckwits working for the department of homeland security. I did not have one of those straps however I had AA wrap each side of my case with packing tape just to make sure it did not fall open. Score... case was obviously opened but this time everything was packed better after the inspection and again nothing was missing.   Got to the hotel at about 7.45 and took a breif nap until lunchtime, then off to work. Today will be spent catching up on old e-mails that have piled up over thae last 3 days. I also need to work on some presentations for TSMC Fab 12 so not much planned in the way of evening entertainment tonight.   Feeling the energy rapidly drain from my system, time for a coffee.

       Sunday  Well I'm off to Taiwan today.... More update to follow once I get there   Football - (Real football, not the American wrapped in cotton version of Rugby)  Well Glasgow Celtic beat Glasgow Rangers again 2-1. This is atl east the 4th time they have beaten their arch rivals (enemies) this season. Rangers winning the domestic treble last year doesn't mean much now. Celtic have dominated the Scottish league this year with multiple classy and determined performances both at home and Europe. Rangers on the otherhand have been pish in Europe and downright un-acceptable at home.   Message to all Rangers Staff & Players at Ibrox:   The time for finger-pointing is over. This has been one disapointing season through and through. It is about time all of the higher paid players earn their cash and put in gutsy performances. There are some descent player on the team..... Why is the heart missing? I know the weather in Scotland is shite. I know the football fans in Scotland are maniacs. You need to understand that football is the way out for many fans to forget their miserable lives. Live up to your high salary... Pull on that jersey for the team and your fans and if you are not able to commit 110% then get the hell out of Ibrox!

       Day 7  Friday afternoon.. bailed out from Hsin-Chu and checked into the Hyatt hotel in Taipei. Had dinner with Kary at a small local Taiwanese place. Food was great but it looked like even rats would avoid this place. Beef dumplings were very tasty and the hot and sour soup was one of the best I have tasted. This is as close to eating from a street vendor as I want to come but honestly there were no side effects. After dinner, we went to a local tea house and relaxed for a while followed by catching a movie at Warner Village.  Starskey & Hutch - not a bad movie, I thought well done and kept in line with the old TV show from the 70's or 80's. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are well suited in the same movies typically and this one was no exception. I noticed that not so many local folks got the laughs [or was I just laughing for no reason?]  Saturday was a slow day. Woke up and had lunch at kary's home, thanks to her mother.... Spent the afternoon annoying her brothers kids [Erika & the twins... I forget their English names]. Once the twins went to sleep for their afternoon nap, we took our Erika and went to check out a local Taiwanese watch company. They make great copies of Rolex and other high end watches. Prices are a bit on the high side but the quality is great. Looks like I may get a yacht-master or submariner [or both] for my birthday. The cost is around $250 each but again the quailty is very good not like the $10 fakes found in China. After dinner, we went to the local Irish bar in Taipei (The Shannon) and I had a couple of pints of guiness but the jetlag kicked in and I was back in the hotel by 1.00am  Sunday was even more relaxing. Kary's father let me borrow his car and I took Kary to the hot springs dotted around the local mountains. We ate some local food and relaxed in one of the hot springs where the temperature of the water is 42 degrees and not adjustable. Only downside is the stench of sulfur but very good for relaxing sore muscles. Took some cool video and pictures in the mountain and headed back to the hotel for some sleep.  Monday was a public holiday in Taiwan so I scored an extra day off [something to do with the tomb sweeping festival where the families get together and clean up ancestors tombs and burn fake money for the ancestors to spend in the after life]. We borrowed the car again and this time drove to a town called Wulai which is more central in Taiwan. There is an incredible cable car that runs up the side of the mountain and allows amazing views of the countryside. Good opportunity to take more pics and then back to Taipei for dinner followed by a movie.  Along Came Polly - I must be in a Ben Stiller mode as I also liked this movie. Again the locals were not laughing but I found out that some of the funny parts were not well translated into chinese and when I explained them slowly to Kary, she was the 2nd person laughing. I finally proved I was not mad but simply the translation to chinese leaves a lot missing. Story line is really weak but still funny none the less. Bonus is gawking at Jennifer Aniston but damn she is starting to look older. Brad Pitt must be banging the hell out of her and she is showing her age.  Anyway...back to work

       Day 16  Trip home begins tomorrow evening...... Yipee  Not much going on here for the last couple of days. Still very busy at work trying to secure official Customer acceptance of our tools in Linkou. This is proving very difficult but I am hopeful we will see 5 systems signed out of the first 12 soon.  On a bizzare note.... As I was waiting for a taxi at the hotel this morning, I witnessed a scuffle / boxing match between a taxi driver and one of the hotel concierge folks. Taiwan is full of very passionate people who seem to get into scuffles very easily [....just watch the news and you will occasionally see footage of their scuffles during their political meetings] but normally these scuffles are just like "handbags at dawn".... where there is lots of name calling, shouting and maybe a slap or two. This morning was cool as punches were being thrown and eventually when another taxi driver came over to stop his "brother" getting into more trouble, the original angered driver turned on him. I almost burst my side laughing, earning me a serious "what the fuck is your game" look from the taxi drivers.  I have no idea what it was about but, it was over very quickly but none the less still very amusing. I guess the taxi driver was eventually convinced by his co-worker that fucking with the hotel would not be good for future business...... Doh  Well what have I been up to the last couple of nights?..... to be honest not much.  Monday - ate dinner with Kary at Hooters in Taipei. It still amuses me these small petite Taiwanese girls are working at hooters, and wearing the same uniform as the much better endowed girls in the US.  Tuesday - ate dinner at a night market [currently on severe health watch]. Almost like eating from the street however the teppenyaki place is really a legit place in the middle of the market.... Food is not sold from a truck or stall. Food was good and so far no blindness, aches or pains...... Spent the rest of the night walking around the market inspecting the poor quality goods on offer.

       Day 14  Currently back in Hsin-Chu but heading back to Taipei this evening. This has been a whirlwind trip so far with me having to be in multiple places at the same time, obviously impossible but still not acceptable to the Customers here. It is proving difficult to mamage but Im getting there.   Thursday  - had urgent meeting in Hsin-Chu so had to leave Taipei, early morning and take a taxi to hsin-chu. Had a couple of meetings with Powerchip to address some RF generator issues and then returned to Taipei late in the evening. Ate dinner with Kary at the Brass Monkey (Ladies Night) and just like before, the place was packed with girls from Taipei taking advantage of the free cocktails [some minus the tails if you know what I mean]   Friday  - had to go to Tainan to make a presentation on Ceramic Electrostatic Chucks to UMC. The new Module manager is very knowledgeable and asked many valid questions. I am typically happy when a Customer knows what he is talking about and doesn't just waste my time by asking bullshit questions for the sake of trying to catch me out. This time, I flew on Trans Asia Airways and the flight was somewhat better than my last experience on Far Eastern Airlines. Only downside was the return ticket I purchased was usless for my return. All flights back to Taipei were fully booked however when the Airline sales clerk noticed I was getting ready to freak out, she somehow managed to bump someone on the next flight and get me on. Back to Taipei around 7.30pm. Ate dinner at a small curry house in the middle of downtown followed up with a couple of beers at a bar called My Other Place.   Saturday  - Taiwan is in turmoil just now due to the political chaos following the very close election. The KMT party & PFP party just lost the election to the DPP Party by a very close margin. Taipei had a huge display of public opinion a couple of weeks ago with more than 500,000 demonstrating near the Presidential Residence. There was another rally planned for today, so I decided to check it out, this time around 200,000 were reported to have been there. I left around 5.00pm but I gather from the news, the peaceful rally turned a bit nasty later with maniacs trying to rush the barricades around the heavily guarded Presidential Residence. All hell broke loose with water cannons being fired on the protestors and the police took multiple injuries due to rocks and bottles being thrown.  From what I can gather, the majority of folks here just want the country to return to normal and most have accepted the result. The KMT & PFP parties seem to be unwilling to accept the result and move on. President Chen may actually increase his support due to the constant complaining and unwillingness of the loosers to accept the result.   Saturday Evening  - went to visit John & Chuimin (Kary's friends from The US who were visiting Chuimin's family after the birth of their daughter Michelle). The house was full of Chuimin's family and former classmates from college. Everyone was fussing over the poor baby who was confused about all the fuss and spent most of the time crying. We eventually went out to the Shannon for a couple of pints until the new parents headed home, we on the other hand grabbed some cheap food and headed off to Roxy Vibe, a small club that stays open until about 4 or 5am. We only lasted until about 2.00 and headed back to the hotel.   Sunday  - I had to check out of the hotel and get back to Hsin-Chu for some wrap up meetings on Monday but before taking the bus back to Hsin-Chu, I went to Hsintien with Kary on the MRT. It is a small place on the outskirts of Taipei that has a lake, a feeble bridge that feels like it will collapse at any minute and many coffee houses along the edge of the lake. I have been out in one of the boats before but this time the water smelled particularly pungent so I stuck to my guns and convinced Kary to just grab a relaxing coffee and then head back to Taipei. Tokk the bus trip back down to Hsin-Chu and used the last remaining hours of Sunday evening to demolish a pizza and catch up on some e-mails.   Monday [Today]  - I need to close out some meetings and issues before I head back to Taipei tonight. I will spend the rest of the time at Inotera before heading back to the USA on Thursday evening...... Back to work

       Back Home Safe & Sound  Well I mad it back safely. I still have jetlag but I am almost through the worst of it. Work is same old shit and right now is becoming very tiresome.   Renegades  This coming weekend is a big one on the map for the Renegades. We have a rehearsal on Saturday and we will debut our 2004 show to the public on Sunday at the 5th Loud Music Symposium held in the Herbst Theatre, San Francisco on Sunday. This looks to be the biggest LMS event to date and the goal is to sell out the event.  As a side note - we have just accepted an invitation to attend a DCM show in July. We will get the chance to compete against the Kilties, Minnesota Brass and some other senior units earlier in the season. This years tour will be local california shows, DCM and DCA. No trip is planned to LA or up north.

       Work  Well here it is folks, Im back off to Taiwan for the next 2-3 weeks. Fuck this... I just got over jetlag then during a technical review meeting if was informed that I needed to get my ass on a plane again. I don't mind so much about heading out to Taiwan but it pisses me off there was no discussion about it. What the fuck! don't worry about any personal plans I had this weekend.    Win at all costs, Find the chink in their armour, Do what you need to do to succeed.... just some of the bullshit I had to listen to this week   People seem to forget we have already been clearly told we are fighting a loosing battle. Once a Customers mind is made up, it is very difficult to change the decision. I really am wasting my time on this trip and everyone knows it exept my management. They need to wake up, smell the coffee and read the writting on the wall.  On an incredible note, I have had a good bit of luck this last 2 weeks in making progress for Customer Acceptance for our tools. I now have secured 8 out of 12 CAR forms from our newest Customer in Taiwan. 4 more to go but hey the pressure on me has dropped significantly   Renegades  Last weekend, we held the 5th annual Loud music symposium in the Herbst Theatre in downtown San Francisco. From what I can gather, the show was a real success and we should have made some cash towards our trip to the midwest for DCM in July and DCA finals in September. I have already heard the MP3 files of our performance and while it may be a little dirty (some sops, who know better need to fucking learn to cut off at the right times) we are in great shape for this season.

       Day 1 - I'm back baby  I am sitting in the office right now and I feel stoned, I mean really stoned. I can't concentrate, I can't focus and everyone wants to tell me their biggest issues right now. I need to do my best to help but all the complaints are not sinking in.  As always, we have multiple issues but today I can't get into it.  I flew out of LAX last night at 1.20am (Monday morning) and arrived in Taipei at 6.00am (Tuesday morning). The 13 or so hour flight was brutal and once again full of Vietnamese & Philipino tourists heading back to their homeland. My attemps at getting sleep were very limited due to the ignorant Vietnamese chick sitting behind me that kept banging the back of my chair and talking to her friend in a voice so loud that my MP3 player could not drown her out. Also experienced some of the worst turbulence I have ever experienced as we flew over Japan towards Taiwan. Women and kids were screaming solid for about 15-20 mins, a kid sitting 2 seats away from me puked all over his mother and her friend (nice smell by the way!) and I don't mind admitting I was kind of worried we were going to plummet from the sky.......   Got to the hotel in Hsin-Chu and checked in about 7.30am. Took a brief nap until 11.30 and got up, showered and headed into the office, where I now sit in a constant dream world. You know the feeling you get when you take some good flu medicine. That feeling where your head is actually not connected to your body. Well take that and multiple x10 and thats the way I feel. I still can't believe I just got over jetlag and now I am back out here to fight it for 2 more weeks followed by 2 more when I get back... whenever the fuck that will be.   I am still very happy I managed to buy my house in Sunnyvale just before Christmas and it looks like the prices have raised around 30-40K already however I would like the opportunity to spend a bit of time there instead of living out of hotels. I guess this is just my burden in life and hey, this job pays the mortgage... right?  On a weird note... check this out:  urlLink http://www.stud.ntnu.no/home/alexann

       Day 11  Still in Taiwan however Im looking to head back on May 18th. I am really disappointed I will miss the camp this weekend with the Renegades but work is more important right?  Bad news over.... now for the good news!  Kary got her visa for the UK. I am officially really happy and relieved. My trip home to the UK is now confirmed and my flights have been arranged. Just need to sort out tickets for Kary, meet her in London and then its off to spend time with friends, family and a bit of sight-seeing. I plan to check out London for a couple of days then head back to Glasgow to stay with my brother. I will rent a car this time so lots of little day trips will be planned.  June 27 - July 8th (Glasgow, I'm coming home!)  This trip is going to be a bumper, filled with lots and lots of incredible fun. On the 8th I fly back to Chicago and wait there for the entire Renegades to arrive in Chicago for the Drum Corps Midwest (DCM) championships that same weekend. Only bummer is that I will have to drag all my corps shit back to Scotland with me.  Anyway, Im fucking still happy about it.

       Day 7  Well I am slowly getting over the brutal jetlag associated with travelling to Taiwan. Luckilly I had a fairly quiet and relaxing weekend.   Friday Evening  Kary came down to Hsin-Chu to visit me from Taipei. We are currently working on getting Kary a UK visa to allow us to visit my friends and family in Scotland sometime in June / July. Obtaining a UK visa is proving to be more difficult than expected and Kary had to spend the afternoon at her sister-in-law's company as they are helping her by claiming she works there, which of course she does not. The UK embassy surprised us by calling Friday morning asking to speak with Kary. The claimed they would call back so Kary had to go wait but they never called back.... Bastards! Kary was planning to come to Hsin-Chu around 8.30pm but this visa issue delayed her arrival until 10.00pm. we just went to TGI Fridays for dinner then back to the hotel as the jetlag started to kick in for me.   Saturday  We had a relaxing walk around Hsin-Chu on saturday afternoon and in the evening, we ate dinner at the hotel and then headed out to the Flying Pig for some drinks. I only planned on drinking 3 or 4 beers but as it was my Birthday on Sunday, we stayed out a little later than planned and 10 or so drinks later it was time for heading home. We got back to the hotel around 4.30 or 5.00am.   Sunday  As it was my Birthday, Kary wanted us to go to a local amusement park close to Hsin-chu, called LeoFoo Village. The park itself was a little lame compared to the typical amusement parks in the US but there was one good rollercoaster I tried out. The park has 4 sections: (1) Animal Kingdom - with lots of monkeys, exotic animals and a bus tour through a section with Lions, Tigers and bears. (2) Arabian Palace - this part was extremley lame, all decked out to look like Arabian palaces etc... no decent rides there. (3) South Pacific - was also kind of lame and the major water rides were shut down. (4) Wild Wild West - this one had the only good rollercoaster I saw and tried out. Overall, we spent about 4 or 5 hours walking around the place before heading back to the hotel. I broke down and ate pizza hut for dinner and then just relaxed in the room watching tv.

       Well Folks... It's Home Time  I am currently sitting in the office closing out a couple of small issues and I will be heading to the airport soon. I should be back home in the US around 3.00pm Tuesday and back home in Sunnyvale by 7.00pm.  No time to get over jetlag because back to work on Wednesday. I will try to sink a couple of beers Tuesday night to help me get a good sleep and then battle the jetlag through the end of the week.   Weekend Plans  We have another camp this coming weekend with the Renegades. I certainly have a lot of catching up to do as the hornline are now marching drill through letter E in part 3. Looks like we have a good opportunity to finish the entire drill this coming weekend so I need to be in good form.   Funny Observations  During this last trip to Taiwan, I have figured out how many people here get there English names. It seems as kids, when taking English classses, the teacher will hand out English names and many of the stick. On the other hand some names are picked because of translation from Chinese sounds into English. The result in both cases can be extremlely amusing...... Some of the best names I have seen to date......  Chief Lay Cola Hawk Feline (everyone calls her pussy) Eagle Elvis Taylor Feng (with chinese accents sounds like telephone) Zeppe   urlLink This Place Really Exists in Taiwan

       Day 14 - Getting Ready to come Home  Well its currently Monday in Taiwan. The weekend was relaxing but damn its hot and humid here.   Friday  Kary came back down from Taipei and we had dinner at TGI Fridays. I don't think I will eat at this place again at night. We had to wait about 45 mins for a table then it was close to 40 mins before our drinks and food arrived. Went back to the hotel around 11.00pm and chilled out   Saturday  Spent the afternoon at Windance shopping mall and spent the coupons given by the hotel. I bought a new pair of sports shoes and bought a new pair for Kary. I also gave the remaining coupons to Kary and she bought a nice dress for our trip back to the UK. Saturday evening was much the same as last week... ate dinner at the hotel and then went out for some beers at the Flying Pig. Hsin-Chu used to be a place with lots of cool bars and places to hang out but to be honest, it is now fairly lame and boring. I much prefer Taipei. The usual hang outs in Hsin-Chu are now just run of the mill and now the friends I have made over the years have moved on and no longer work in the bars.  Saturday night was interesting at the Flying Pig. There was a male strip show put on for the ladies so it was good opportunity for me to sneak a couple of extra beers while Kary watched the show. The "dude" was very lame. He was more like a dancer than a sripper and his routine was just funny at best. The local ladies were trying to rip his shorts off but he put up a good fight. Very lame at best but I could not stop laughing as he looked like a former co-worker in the US (Vincent Kot).    Sunday  Had lunch at a local beef noddles shop and then took the train to TaoYuan to spend the afternoon. Spent about 1 hour at a cute little Chinese tea house close to the train station and the rest of the afternoon walking around TaoYuan. Caught the train back to Hsin-Chu and ate dinner at a small steak house followed by 1 hour relaxing at the hotel swimming pool / sauna.

       Renegades  Well we had a very strong rehearsal this past weekend (Sat & Sun). The whole corps has raised the bar a notch or two and rehearsal etiquette was by far the best I have seen over the last couple of years. Visually the corps is working harder and smarter than ever before.  It was a long grueling weekend however we are now fully through Part 1, 2 & 3 and a little into part 4 of the show. After coming back from Asia last week, the jetlag got to me late on saturday and after lunch on sunday. By sunday evening I was totally exhausted and suspect I got a bit of sun stroke. Monday was tough to get through but luckilly Im feeling better and stronger today.   Next weekend is an off weekend for the corps so I plan on spending some time continuing my mission to paint the house. I hope to get the 2nd - 3rd floor hallway done and hopefully the 1st - 2nd floor hallway, including the 1st floor bathroom.

      Well folks..... while 90% of people in the US were hanging out with family & friends at BBQ's around the country, I was at home with paint brush in hand. I spent the last 3 days on my quest to paint the 1st floor hallway. Not quite finished but almost there.  Anyway the quest continues................

      Well, I am happy to report that I have finished the painting in the 1st floor hallway and stairwell. The tall ceilings made it very difficult but I managed, just took longer. This weekend in addition to finishing the painting, I installed 2 sliding glass doors in the upstairs bathroom and tossed out that old horrible looking shower curtain. Installation was fairly easy although I made a bollocks of the sealant around the frame and now have some minor leaks. I will make a trip to Home Depot again and buy more sealant and correct this problem later in the week.   Renegades  Well it is very close to the season opening day. We have Blue Devils family day next Saturday so it was important that we actually finished learning the show this weekend. Drums were on Sat & Sun but the brass section was only on today (sun). We have now learned all the drill although next week it probably look like we are making it up as we go. There are no judges at BD family day so no problem although there is typically a large crowd of people who know what they are seeing. We should be loud enough to keep them off our backs but I hope we only march part of the show and standstill the rest. Anyway it was a good rehearsal today apart from the muddy field we spent the morning on. That definitely damped the spirits and did not help rehearsal etiquette or concentration. The afternoon block was on a dry field thus we managed to complete the show and run a full runthrough for the first time in 2004. If you like Jazz with some music from the Matrix, a Pink Floyd ballad and some other shit for good measure.... You will be guaranteed to like this show. Should be killer at DCM (Chicago) and DCA (Scranton)

       Blue Devils Family Day  Well the San Francisco Renegades Senior Drum & Bugle Corps got down to business this last weekend with a Saturday (2 Block) rehearsal followed by our Field Show debut at Blue Devils Family Day. The performance was reasonable and only fell apart in a couple of places, a little better than I thought it would be... Resulting in a standing ovation again from the BD crowd. We only marched Part 1,2 &3 and performed Part 4 in a standstill formation. That was followed by a rehearsal on Sunday that I could not attend due to work commitments however I understand it went really well.   NorCal Show Weekend Straight Ahead  This coming weekend, we have 2 actual competitions where we will go head-to-head with the River City Regiment. I think right now it will be impossible for them to beat us but hopefully they can snap at our heels and keep us on our toes. Again, I have said it before our show this year is absolute genius and the crowds are sure to love it. Looks like we should be in good shape to march and play the full show this coming weekend  Saturday - Moonlight Classic (Stockton) Sunday - Pacific Procession (Hayward State)   On A Bizarre Note......    urlLink Man arrested - driving while blind

      Well the Renegades had 2 competitions this last weekend. Saturday was the opening show in Stockton California followed by a show in Hayward on Sunday.   Moonlight Classic - Stockton  The Renegades were first on (Senior Corps get the shaft at DCI shows). The performance was acceptable however it felt to me a bit apprehensive and nervous. I thought I could detect a couple of ensemble tears but it held together... mission accomplished. Scores on the doors were Renegades: 65.10, River City: 46.20   Precision West / Pacific Procession - Hayward  The show opened with the River City Regiment, followed by the Renegades. Again I did not see much from the show but I felt that the Renegades performance was much more solid than the previous night and it was rewarded from the judges by a 2.5 point increase in score. Overall the Renegades are off to the best start we have ever had. We are now on a cleaning mission before DCM. Scores on the doors were Renegades: 67.60, River City: 44.55  This year it has been good to note that we are scoring above the DCI DivII / Div III corps as we are judged on the same sheets (Judging Criteria). This is the first time this has happened in all the time I have been with the Renegades, infact we had the 3rd highest score on both evenings out of at total 12 or so corps. Very cool to see that we are actually getting rewarded by the judging community.  Next weekend we have a one day rehearsal on Saturday, them I'm off to Scotland on vacation for 2 weeks. I will meet up with the Corps in Chicago for DCM finals the weekend of the 9th.

      Well folks! I just got back to California and am now back in the office preparing for an up-coming business trip to Taiwan. I had a great 2 weeks in the UK followed by a weekend in Chicago for the Drum Corps Midwest (DCM) championships where the Renegades finally went head to head with the Kilties and Minnesota Brass, Inc.  Here follows a long blow by blow of the last 2 weeks:   Saturday  Went to a Renegades rehearsal but had to take off about 3.30pm to get ready, get laundry finished and bags packed for my trip to London.   Sunday  Woke up very very early for me at around 7.00am and got my shit together to head to the airport. Flight to Chicago very uneventful except for leaving my cell phone on the plane, luckily American Airlines helped retrieve it for me. Just made my connection to London as they were about to close the door, a bit agitated and out of breath but hey I made it. Tried to sleep but not really successful.   Monday  Arrived at London Heathrow where I had arranged to meet Kary at her arrival gate from Taiwan via Bangkok. Asked a local LHR employee which gate the flight from Bangkok would arrive at and he lost his mind. Apparently you are not allowed to wait at the gate and this asshole made me head out towards immigration with the rest of the group, herded like cattle. Luckily Kary's flight was due to land about 15 mins later than mine so I just had to wait for her at the entrance to the main immigration hall. 30 mins later, I spotted her walking towards the immigration area. I decided to go through the non EU passport line with Kary just in case she ran into any problems with the immigration officer. With a little prompting, Kary answered all the questions asked we headed off to collect our luggage.  We collected all our shit and took the London underground to Piccadilly Circus to check into the hotel. The hotel was definitely not as nice as it looked on the Internet however the room was acceptable as a place to just sleep. I had no intentions of hanging out in the room anyway but man this place was old....... The hotel folks were great and allowed us to check in 4 hours early to give us a chance to get a couple of hours sleep.  We woke up around lunch time and got ready to go sightseeing. I showed Kary around Buckingham Palace, Pall Mall, Kensington Park, Downing Street, The Houses of parliament, Westminster Abbey and finally we checked out the British Airways London Eye followed by Trafalgar Square. We headed back to the hotel for a brief nap then went out to dinner at a Chinese restaurant in China Town, followed by a walk around Soho and a quick drink at O'Neils (an Irish Bar in China Town).   Tuesday  After a good nights sleep and some jetlag, we got up early and headed out to tour the Tower of London, Tower Bridge and The British Museum. After a brief nap, we ate dinner at a small Indian restaurant in Soho and had a couple of drinks around Soho. We spent the rest of the night at a bar / Club called Tiger Tiger until the wee hours.   Wednesday  Not a whole lot we could do due to the Tube Strike so we took a London city bus tour, taking pics but mostly relaxing. You are supposed to get off at the major stops to go sightseeing however we had already seen most of the places on the tour and St Pauls Cathedral looked to be under heavy re-construction we decided to stay on the bus until Madame Tusaude's (the famous wax dummy museum). To be honest, I did not really want to see the place but it was more impressive than I expected. We took the tour bus back towards the hotel but got off a Regent Street and walked all the way back to Piccadilly Circus, stopping at all the stores Kary wanted to look in. Before dinner we took a bike ride out to Covent Garden but unfortunately most of the stores were closing for the night so we made our way back to the hotel and ate traditional British Fish & Chips at the famous Harry Ramsdens restaurant located right next to the hotel. We walked around Piccadilly Circus for some last minute souvenirs and closed the night in the hotel bar, just relaxing and getting mentally ready for the trip to Scotland.   Thursday  Got up a little later than the last couple of days at 9.30am, got ready, ate breakfast then packed up all our stuff. Took the tube to Heathrow and before we knew it, we had arrived in Glasgow.  Picked up the rental car at the airport and headed out to my brothers place where we would be staying the next 7 days. Raymond gave us a tour of his new house and showed off all his electronic additions, including an 88" digital projection TV and kick ass home theatre sound system. Depressed... I headed out to my favorite local bar for a couple of good Scottish beers and met up with my good friend Paul. We hung out until close to midnight then Raymond, Kary & myself went to a local dance club called Vienna. The name has changed a bit over time (Tolledo... Club 30.... Vienna) and the place has a new look to go with the name change, however in my mind this place will always be affectionately known as Club Slapper. It was reasonably busy for a Thursday evening but not really that impressive as the music was garbage. They never used to play all that Techno shit before!   Friday  Drove out to the Bishopton Hotel for lunch. Bishopton is a small village I grew up in and is located about 5 miles out of Paisley. After lunch, we drove down to Ayr to see the old cottage where the famous Scottish poet, Robert Burns was born. Ayr is a small seaside town on the west coast of Scotland and the weather was typical of a Scottish summer... Rain, Clouds, Sunshine, Hot & Cold. On the way home, we stopped off at the amazing Electric Brae (Brae is Scottish for Hill). This is a hill on the coastal road where you can face your car downhill, stop the engine and believe it or not.... you will roll back up the hill. It was called Electric Brae as everyone thought it was caused due to a magnetic effect but it has since been proven to be an optical illusion. The surrounding hills and trees lie at a very bizarre angle causing the effect that the road is going uphill but in fact is really going downhill.  Back to Paisley for dinner and spend the evening at O'Neill's bar followed by some drinks at a new bar called Suburbia (a huge bar designed to look like a street inside with 3 or 4 smaller bars within all playing different styles of music.   Saturday  Went to Glasgow for lunch with Andy & Angela (2 good friends). Spent a couple of hours shopping around Glasgow's famous Argyle street shopping area. Took the train back to Paisley and got ready to go out for the evening. We headed back into Glasgow again and met up with several friends at a bar called the Drum & Monkey. Kary was having a difficult time understanding my friends as the Scottish accent is very hard and the people talk very fast with many slang words. As the beers were consumed, the accent becomes faster and faster but everyone tried hard to speak slower and Kary did manage to have several conversations with my friends. The lack of dinner played an effect and Kary ended up a little on the drunk side, with me following closely. The bar closed around midnight so we headed out to a bar / club called Outback. This is an Australian style bar with a dance club upstairs. We had a couple more drinks then it was time for home.   Sunday  Due to excessive alcohol consumption a long sleep was required so not much would get done. Late in the Afternoon, I took Kary to visit my Grand Mother (Mother's Mother). We had afternoon tea and headed back by brothers place for a relaxing evening.   Monday  I wanted to show Kary Edinburgh Castle, so we headed out early and drove out to Edinburgh. Driving in Edinburgh is a nightmare but we eventually found adequate parking about 1 mile from the Castle. Spent a couple of hours walking around the stores on the Royal Mile then ventured into the Castle to look around. Took plenty of pictures but it took a little longer to get around the Castle and the result was a Fucking Parking Ticket, courtesy of the Edinburgh City Council Fuckwits!!!  I managed to catch the traffic warden and vent my frustration at getting a ticket when only 5 mins late but the Prick threatened a 2nd ticket for meter feeding so I took off. This was enough of Edinburgh for me to handle so we took off heading back to the normal side of Scotland... The West Coast!  On the way home, we stopped off at the relatively new Braehead shopping mall in Renfrew and then headed back to Paisley where I had arranged to meet an old friend Neil for a couple of beers at my favorite bar Paddy Malarky's   Tuesday  We got up early and headed off for Loch Lomond. I stopped at a beautiful village called Luss, right on the banks of Loch Lomond to show Kary the incredible views. We continued north to Glencoe in the highlands and again stopped off periodically to take some pictures and take in the incredible scenery. Scotland by far is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and going back after all these years brought similar feelings to the first time I drove down into Yosemite valley. The highlands are incredibly beautiful but you need to be luck with the weather. For us it was cloudy but mostly dry... very acceptable.  We made the 2 - 3 hour drive back to Paisley and headed out for dinner with my friends at a small pub / restaurant between Glasgow & Paisley. The food was really good however a bit on the expensive side for this type of place.   Wednesday  This was to be our last day in Scotland so Kary wanted to spend a lot of time in Glasgow to do more customary shopping. Dropped off the rental car at the airport and took the train into Glasgow. Spent the entire afternoon walking around Argyle St and Buchanan St where the majority of the good shopping areas are located. My Friend Andy came to pick us up on the way home from work and took us out to see his new house. The new house is very impressive but a little on the expensive side for Scotland. I guess the property prices have risen dramatically since I lived there. After a couple of hours chilling out and chatting, Andy & Angela dropped us back into Paisley where we stopped off at a new Italian restaurant for dinner. Unfortunately I forget the name but this is the best Italian food I have ever eaten outside of Italy and very reasonably priced. This place used to be a small lunch style cafe but now has became a very chic Italian eater.   Thursday  Woke up really early to get flight from Glasgow back to London. Kary was heading out to Taipei via Bangkok and I was flying out to Chicago for 3 days before returning to California on Sunday. Flight to Chicago was incredible.... I got a free upgrade to Business Class (I guess due to my new status of 1,000,000 miles). I arrived very refreshed in Chicago, picked up my rental car and mad the drive south to visit my Cousin James. It was cool to see his kids have grown up significantly from the toddlers they were last time I saw them, Elizabeth and James now 10 & 9 respectively. Spent a couple of hours catching up on old times and then jetlag kicked in and I crashed out about 10.00pm   Friday  Woke up early and left for Dekalb about 9.30am. The Renegades had flown in on a red eye for the DCM championships in Dekalb, arriving about 6.00am. Drive was uneventful and I made it in about 2 1/2 hours from south Chicago. Stopped off for a quick lunch and then set of to find my hotel and hook up with the rest of the corps for some rehearsal blocks. The weather was shite and we got fairly wet during the rehearsal block why dragged by very very slowly. We had to wrap up rehearsal around 5.00pm to get dinner and get ready for an outdoor concert we were asked to play in.  We were performing last however I got to hear the end of the Kilties performance. Their brass line has really improved and I can't wait to hear them at DCA.  Well as far as our performance went.... Holy Shit! We are really fucking loud. This was one of the best, if not the actual best standstill performances we have ever had. The crowd went nuts from start to finish.   Ladies & Gentlemen.... The Renegades are in the Midwest!     Saturday  Saturday consisted of 2 rehearsal blocks in preparation for our appearance and head to head competition with Kilties & Minnesota Brass, Inc. There were other corps in attendance but these are the ones closer to us. The rest were very small and a much lower standard.  We had an OK show but it was definitely not to the same standard as our runthrough in the afternoon. Definitely some meltdowns during some of the percussion features and I personally did not have a great show... hope it was due to the humidity and multiple mosquito bites I suffered during the warm up.  Results - We took 2nd behind MBI (really expected) however we did win some Visual and Brass captions. Drums took a beating but we should be in good shape to beat these guys later this year at DCA.  Unfortunately I missed the after show festivities as I felt really tired and could not face any more beers (hopefully jetlag related). I guess the party went on until 4.00am or so but I was safely tucked up in bed.   Sunday  Woke up, checked out and drove back to Chicago O'Hare airport. Returned the rental car and managed to get on an earlier flight back to San Jose.  This was a fairly busy 2 week trip and I got to see and do lots of cool things. Definitely one of the best vacations I have had in a while. It was great to see old friends and family back in Scotland again. Really cool to introduce Kary my girlfriend to my home country and an incredible experience to take part in the DCM championships.

      After returning from my UK vacation, there was not a lot of time to settle back into normal life. I spent 1 week at work catching up on e-mails and coming back up to speed on the technical issues at work. The weekend was taken up by Drum Corps as the Renegades had a weekend of competitions and I am now back in Taiwan on business.    Saturday - West Coast Showdown   On Saturday, I made the trek up to Stockton for some rehearsal with the corps then headed up to Sacramento for the West Coast Showdown competition. This would be the 1st of 2 competitions where we went head to head with the 2 other Senior Corps in California,  River City Regiment  from Sac &  Dream  from LA. We were on first however on this occasion we were lucky to be in a night show and on after dark, meaning we got to perform under the lights. It was also a good opportunity to get off the field and see the other senior corps from the stands. River City had done a good job getting people into the stands and although this was a small stadium, it was good to see it almost full with spectators. Our show was fairly ok and it is good to see that everytime we perform, we are getting better and the show is starting to solidify. Our mantra that every show is just another run through is working in that no-one is over hyping and trying to be a hero.  Dream  were on next and the long bus trip was really evident in their performance. The show was very tired and on the weak side. Dave Emmonds (Corps Director) told me after the show they were really nervous and tired but promised a better showing the following day.  River City Regiment  have improved significantly since the last time I seen them. The show was more solid than before and they continue to head in the right direction. Their show is well designed to highlight Sop Soloist Brian Hodgkins. This guy is young but very talented and the audience love this guy. Every time I see him, he has cut his lip but still manages to play well.    Sunday - Firebird Classic   Sunday started off with a quick trip to San Leandro for a brief morning block rehearsal then we headed back to Sunnyvale to prepare for the show. This is a good show for me as it is very close to home and I always have time to take a shower and get ready for the show at a relaxed pace. We were on after  RCR &amp; Dream  but it was still early in the show when the sun was splitting the skies. Our show was a little better than the previous night but it did start to loose steam towards the end.  Dream  had a more solid show as predicted but Brian Hodgkins from  RCR  told me they had a better show in Sacramento.    Monday   In an effort to reduce my expected lifetime by about 5 years, I had planned a Trip to Taiwan for some Customer meetings. My life is becoming a bit of a blur with all the travel I have been making recently and I have not had a good chance to get over jetlag. Oh well,&nbsp;I might as well feel tired and groggy in Taiwan where there are some benefits for me......    urlLink Kary....     Tuesday - Friday (blur due to Jetlag)   I arrived in Taiwan on Tuesday evening (localtime). I checked into the Hyatt hotel in&nbsp;Taipei where I would spend the first 3 days at Inotera in Linkou. The weekend was also planned for Taipei with me heading to Hsin-Chu on Sunday evening.   Taiwan is really hot this time of year and it is almost unbearable at times. Not really much to do except hang around the air conditioned hotel room or go to see a movie or something like that.    Friday Night - Spiderman 2   I went to see sm2 with Kary. Thought it was going to be lame as most sequels fail to capture the same presence as the originals but this one was good. Not really much to say about it but I enjoyed it....    Saturday   Kary took me to a club on Saturday night called "Brown Sugar". It is a very cool Jazz club with a resident 4 or 5 piece band. Stayed for several hours just listening to the cool Jazz music in a relaxed atmosphere but the drinks are really expensive in this place so watch your tab carefully. After the band was finished, Kary introduced me to the Trombone player (she used to work with this guy at an English language school years ago), Matt recommended to go back on a Wednesday evening as there would be a big band playing. If I can make it back to Taipei on a Wednesday, I will definitely have to check it out.    Sunday   Checked out of the hotel late and had a slow relaxing lunch followed by coffee on the 5th floor of Taipei 101 (worlds current tallest building).    urlLink Taipei 101   &nbsp;  Took the bus to Hsin-Chu and checked into the Hsin-Chu Royal Hotel.
