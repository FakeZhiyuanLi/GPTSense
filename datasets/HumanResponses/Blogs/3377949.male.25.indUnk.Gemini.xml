      So I was bored out of my mind yesterday and decided to stop by the local cinema to catch a movie. That movie was  urlLink Van Helsing . If horrible writing, an incoherent plot, terrible acting, and ridiculous CGI special effects make a good movie, than this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was holding out hope that I would enjoy this, seeing as how I've always had a thing for the old  urlLink Universal  monster movies, like "Dracula" and "The Wolfman". I thought it would be good, cheesy, popcorn fun. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Some films are so bad that you can't even laugh at them. This was one of them.   My birthday is coming up (June 3). 25 years old. A quarter of a century. The march to middle age begins in earnest. Here is my possible itinerary for my birthday weekend (for those in Halifax, contact my ass and join the festivities and  buy me booze ):   Thursday, June 3 : After work, go to Tom's, get Aglio E Olio (pasta with garlic, olive oil, crushed chilies, Parmesan), have several pints, reflect on the last 25 years of my existence. There is a slight possibility that I'll go to  Hell's Kitchen at  urlLink The Marquee  to see  urlLink Eugene Ripper . We'll see.    Friday, June 4 : See  urlLink Mark Bragg And The Black Wedding Band  at Stage 9, Halifax's newest live music venue. Be there. Buy me booze.    Saturday, June 5 : If the weather is decent, lounge around on the waterfront all day and swing by  Sackville Landing  to check out  urlLink Tumbleweed 4 , the all day, FREE outdoor rock concert.  urlLink The Spincycle Squared  are on the bill.  urlLink Alfred Remo  is a rock star. It's gonna be fun kids.

      In the fine tradition of this blog (that's about 2 weeks old), I present to you the  Friday List !   Iain's Top Five "Beers Of The World"       urlLink Harp  (Ireland) - This is what Alexander Keith's would taste like if it was brewed by angels.    urlLink Corona  (Mexico) - Open the bottle. Add slice of lime. Drink. Repeat as needed. Have a siesta. Muy bueno.    urlLink Stella Artois  (Belgium) - You can't help but feel classy drinking this beer. Even the cans are classy. Top drawer.    urlLink Foster's  (Australia) - This is quite a good beer, in my opinion, but the best part is that it comes a these  huge  cans. True, by the end of the can, the beer is kind warm, but they sure look cool. You feel like Crocodile Dundee when you're drinking out of one of these bad boys.     urlLink Kronenberg 1664  (France) - This is a new addition to my drinking rotation, and it fits in quite nicely, thank you very much. Plus, I like the fact that there's a date in the name. I don't know why, I just do.       Any peeps in the Halifax area should swing by  urlLink The Planet  tomorrow to check out  urlLink Slowcoaster . If you see me there, buy me a drink sucka!   urlLink How bout some cartoons!

      So I'm going to "Retro Night" at the  urlLink Marquee Club  tonight with a few friends. Yippee, all the Kris Kross, C&C Music Factory, and Bananarama one could ever want. Score. Wish me luck, and here's to hoping I don't get   urlLink shot in the gut  (check the report for May 23).   Is it just me, or does brocolli not belong on a pizza at all? The same goes for zucchini.    urlLink Save me, Jeebus!

      So I finally had a chance to see what many have called one of the worst movies of all time,  urlLink Gigli . I simply had to see it for myself. What a mistake. As for my opinion of the movie, I'll leave it as this: those are 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Also, how the hell did the producers convince Christopher Walken AND Al Pacino to become involved in this shit?!   ***** SPOILER ALERT *****  Not that anybody would care about me revealing the ending to Gigli, if you haven't seen the film yet and simply cannot bear to have the experience ruined, skip the rest of this paragraph. There are basically 3 main actors in the film; Ben Affleck, J.Lo, and Justin Bartha. Bartha plays a mentally challenged kid who is kidnapped by Affleck (don't ask) in order to put pressure on the kid's federal prosecuter brother (again, don't ask). Throughout the entire movie, Bartha's character wants to go to the beach (or, "the Baywatch", as he refers to it). So, lots of stuff happens, and at the end, Ben and J.Lo end up taking the poor little guy to the beach (hooray). Then, after Ben and J.Lo decide to ride off into the sunset together (J.Lo plays a lesbian, by the way, but still falls for Ben's wily charms. Yup), they  leave the mentally challenged kid at the beach , by himself! What the fuck! How irresponsible! Fuck this shit movie!  ***** END SPOILER ALERT *****    In happier news, I purchased the new  urlLink Ween  concert DVD today. I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl.

      The wedding reception last night went well. I had a chance to hang out with a few people I haven't seen in a long while, and there was none of the potential awkwardness that could have accompanied the situation; just a pleasant evening eating various forms of pasta and potato salads, drinking, and dancing to crappy music with friends. Good stuff. I even kept the drinking to a fair minimum (for me)and awoke this morning hangover free. Good stuff indeed.   Friday night I went out to the  Capri Club  with some other friends. It got me thinking back to when I had just turned 19 and was living in Sydney for the summer. My little group of friends and I spent at least one night a week at that bar it seemed, which is kind of odd considering that it may be one of the crappiest bars I've ever been privy to get knackered in. The Capri (or Crapi as I like to call it) is a smallish dance bar in "beautiful downtown Sydney". They used to have these crazy $1 drink specials, so it was one of the more crowded bars in town. The combination of large, liqoured up crowds and small space usually added up to quite an uncomfortable situation. The floors were always sticky, it was usually way too hot, and the music usually never strayed too far from the usual Top 40 pop crap most bars in this province seem to play. Despite all of this, I usually had a fun time (although I suppose that after downing 13 gin and cranberries, I'd have a good time just about anywhere). I guess that it was just the fact that I was with my friends that made it fun, and not the bar itself, but the Crapi definitely became one of the focal points for my weekend fun. I mean, it was that, or go to  Smooth Herman's  (the other (in)famous late night dive in Sydney). Seriously, if anybody reading this is not originally from Sydney and plans to visit, stay as far away from Smooth Herman's as you possibly can. Trust me.

       Top 5 Toys I Loved When I Was A Young Lad       urlLink Transformers  - It goes without saying that Transformers were some of the coolest toys ever produced in the history of the known universe. "Hey look, it's a robot. Whoa dude, check it out, now it's a jeep! Awesome!" The only Transformers who didn't make sense to me were the ones that turned into boom boxes. I mean, come on now, the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons get to turn into sports cars and jets, and all Soundwave (Decepticon) and Blaster (Autobot) can do is turn into a tape deck?! Talk about getting the short end of the stick. On the plus side however, the cassettes that came with the tape deck dudes turned into birds and wolves and shit. Rad.    urlLink Hotwheels / urlLink Micro Machines  - Now I know Hot Wheels and Micro Machines are technically two different things, but I still categorize them both under the "really tiny automobile replicas" genre. I remember having a  ton  of these little bastards back in the day. Hot Wheels were an essential part of one of my favorite childhood games: "Dinky Car Smash-up Derby". The game consisted of two Hot Wheels cars (one for myself, one for my brother), lining them up, and then crashing them into each other. Whichever car stayed on its wheels won. Brilliant    urlLink He-Man  - I remember one Halloween my brother and I went out dressed as Skeletor and He-Man, respectively. Yeah, we were big into the cartoon and toys. We had this castle-like thing called "Snake Mountain", and the giant snake head had this weird "microphone" thingy in it that made your voice sound all funny. Plus there was a guy called "Stinkor", who actually stunk. Really.    urlLink Starcom  - These toys consisted of various spacecraft that had little metal plates strategically placed on them, and little cosmonauts with little magnet feet (and cool little visors on their helmets). The cosmonaut dudes had cool names too, like "Capt. Pete Yablonski". Sweet.    urlLink M.U.S.C.L.E. Wrestlers  - Based on some weird Japanese cartoon, these were little one inch tall pink wrestlers. There were over 200 of these things, and only two of them had names; "Muscle Man" (the main good guy), and "Terri Bull" (the main bad guy). The rest looked like rejected Batman villains.     Honourable mention goes to  urlLink Fireball Island . While technically not a toy (it was a board game), it was definitely one of the better things my brother and I owned. The object was to get your little plastic adventurer up to the top of a mountain (which was actually a board game sized 3D plastic mountain - very cool) and retrieve a jewel. Sounds boring, but at the top of the mountain is this giant scary head, which spits "fireballs" (little red marbles) at your poor little man-shaped token and knocks his sorry ass back down the mountain. I'll take that over Monopoly any day of the week.

      So I'm going to  urlLink Sydney  this weekend for my ex-girlfriend's wedding reception. This may sound weird, but I'm actually looking forward to it. The whole thing could just end up being a few hours of excruciating akwardness, but I seriously doubt it (and if it does come to that, I'm sure there will be plenty of booze around).   So I just read an  urlLink article  about the recent bombing of a  wedding party  in Iraq by the U.S. military, and a particular quote stuck out at me:    Gen. James Mattis of the U.S. Marine Corps, said his troops have nothing to apologize for, adding, "Let's not be naive,  bad things happen in wars ."    "Bad things happen in wars." Yeah, bad things happen in wars when you  bomb a wedding party ! It boggles the mind that somebody could actually throw off such a flippant and insensitive remark like that. Jesus.   Take a few breaths, count to 10...wind in the willows, wind in the willows. Okay, I'm better now. How bout some links to bring back the levity. Shazam!   urlLink Readin'   urlLink Watchin'   urlLink Listenin'   urlLink Hardy har har

       Begin rant:   So I went to lunch today at the  urlLink Subway  on Spring Garden Road, as I often do. It seems like everytime I get there, it's right in the middle of the lunchtime rush. I don't mind this, because the line seems to move fairly fast. What bothers me is the supervisor that is usually on duty at this time. Her sole job seems to be to stress out the line workers, tell them that they are doing everything wrong, and generally berate them in front of the customers. I mean, the "Sandwich Artists" are doing the best they can to keep the line moving as fast as possible, all the while trying to make a sub that looks somewhat edible when it's all finished. The thing that pisses me off the most though is when the supervisor becomes so exasperated with the inneptness of her employees , she decides to "show em' how its done" and get on the line herself. The thing is, she can't make a sub worth shit! A blind monkey could put together a better sub than her! The meat is all on one side, the vegetables on the other, spilling out of the bread since they were tossed in there with so much haste. She puts the sauce on in such a hurry the sub becomes a soggy mess, and when she cut my sub in half, it wasn't so much two halves as it was one tiny portion (say 1/4) and one big portion. And it wasn't even cut all the way through. This is the person who is constantly correcting the "mistakes" of her employees?! Someday I would love to just flip out and tear a strip off of her, but all I invariably end up doing is giving a sympathetic, "I feel your pain" smile to the poor Subway worker who has the misfortune of being stuck under her tyrannical rule. Here's to hoping someday one of her underlings will find the courage to tell her where to go.    End rant.    urlLink You think you have a horrible job? Check these out.

      So I bought comedian David Cross' 2002 tour CD,  urlLink "Shut Up You Fucking Baby" , and the tour documentary,  urlLink "Let America Laugh"  on DVD. For anybody who don't know, Mr. Cross was one half of HBO's  urlLink Mr. Show , and he's a funny guy. He's bald too, so there ya go. Go out now and buy them shits. Thank me later. While you're at it, buy Seasons 1-3 of  Mr. Show  on DVD also. For reals yo.  For those of you out there who read this blog (hahahahaha) and live in Halifax, or plan to visit Halifax, you should definitely stop by  urlLink Tom's Little Havana . It's a cigar bar, but they have excellent food (try the  Havana Rolls  or the  Pad Thai ), good beer, and the service is fantastic. Tell em Iain sent ya. Word.

      Here's and interesting link for those of you who (like myself) enjoy the occassional after-dinner cocktail or  aperitif .  urlLink Modern Drunkard Magazine  A few choice selections:  urlLink Party Politics   urlLink Drunk Talk  Finally, here are some definitions from the  urlLink Drunk Talk  article above that have applied to me, at some point in "drinking career":     AWOG  adj. Absent Without Saying Goodbye. Slipping out of a bar or party without telling your friends.  - I can admit to doing this from time to time, and I apologize if I have ever done this to any of you. I'm sure I had a good reason. STOP JUDGING ME!     alcoheimers  n. the inability to remember what happened while drinking the night before.  - This has happened to me on occassion, but not in a while. Sometimes I may forget little bits and pieces, but the full blackout-style memory loss is rare.      barf-lies  n. post-vomiting affirmations that you will never drink again.  - Although I rarely ever drink to the point of vomiting, I have denounced drinking on many a hungover morning. One of these days I'll follow through on these affirmations, you'll see.     blank shame  n. the vague feeling of guilt experienced in the aftermath of a blackout, without knowing if you actually did anything wrong.  - I've only "blacked out" a couple of times, but this feeling is an invariable part of that experience, I believe. It sucks.     booze-bonding  n. male or female bonding accelerated by the presence of alcohol.  - I've done this often. Alcohol can be a great "social lubricant". Some people say that you shouldn't need alcohol to be social. To them I say, stop harshing my buzz, Captain Bringdown!     calling Captain Nemo  v. to vomit into a toilet.  - A rite of passage for any drinker. I've vomited in much more interesting places, but a toilet is defintely the preferred recepticle. People who vomit in bathtubs piss me off. I mean, the toilet is right there next to you! Jeez.     drinking with Godot  adj. drinking while waiting for friends who may or may not arrive; from the Beckett play Waiting For Godot, wherein the title character never appears.  - My penchant for arriving everywhere early has put me in this position many times. The worst ever was a night at the Capri in Sydney. I showed up a good hour and a half before ANYBODY else in the bar showed up. Just me, my pitcher of beer, the bartenders, and about 6 surly looking bouncers. Fun times.     hurdling in the Special Olympics  v. to trip over furniture while drunk.  - Furniture, cracks in the sidewalk, stairways, parked cars...     jason  n. a drunk who passes out briefly then rises again to drink; a reference to the irrepressible Jason Voorhees protagonist of the Friday the 13th horror film series.  - A few times during my tenure at St. F.X., but now I know better.     juice jacket  n. the condition of feeling warmer due to drinking  - Walking around downtown Sydney on New Year's Eve at 2 in the morning in nothing but a t-shirt is a  bad idea  kids.     job-sick/bar-well  adj. the state of being too ill to go to work but fit enough to go the bar.  - While not applicable to work, this often was the case during my years at university.     lashed to the past  adj. to become very nostalgic while drinking.  - This usually occurs when drinking with friends from high school (GO WILDCATS!), or with any of my friends who have an extensive knowledge of 80's pop culture (you know who you are).     trolling the void  v. attempting to piece together a blackout by posing seemingly casual questions to friends who were possibly more cognizant at the time.  - After one memorable occassion at St. F.X., this took up most of the following Sunday.

(I was going to post these on Thursday, but I figure that since I have work off that day, I probably won't be able to do much blogging, seeing as how I may end up celebrating Canada Day in the traditional manner: getting drunk at noon and passing out in a drunken stupor by 3 PM.

      Check out this  urlLink Flash game  that simulates walking home drunk. Move your mouse left and right to keep your balance. My farthest distance so far has been 63 meters. Oh yeah, ya gotta download  urlLink this  if ya wanna play.  This game reminded me of something that happened to me when I first moved to Halifax. One night I decided to head down to the  urlLink Marquee  to see  urlLink Rock Ranger . I had a good time (maybe a little  too good , if you catch my drift), and ended up leaving by myself. If was late, but it was warm, summer night, and I was in good spirits, so I didn't mind and took my sweet old time. Now, I had made the walk from the Marquee to Seaforth St. many times, drunk and sober, and had yet to encounter any problems. Until now. Here's a map to help my explanation along:   The Marquee is where the  red star  is. My house is represented by the  pink dot . So I was just strolling along, mindin' my own biz-nass, when all of a sudden the house and buildings around me stop looking familiar. A few minutes later I realize, Jesus, I'm lost! How could this have happened? After stumbling around aimlessly a little while longer, I happened to glance down at the sidewalk. Most of the sidewalks in Halifax, at intersections, have the street names carved into the cement. When I looked down to see where I was, I was shocked. Gottigen Street! The Marquee is on Gottigen Street! Somehow I had ended up on the same street, despite the fact that I began my walk home by walking  away  from Gottigen. Now I was drunk and freaking out. I began frantically searching for a payphone, even though I couldn't even tell a cab where I was. I finally came across the  Casino Taxi  dispatch office on Isleville St., indicated on the map by the  blue dot . After banging on their window for 10 minutes, a cab came by and took my drunk ass home. I had ended up nearly 20 blocks or so away from my original destination. The next day I said to myself, "Iain, you will never touch a drop of alcohol for the rest of your life." And do you know what folks? Nearly 3 years later, I never have.

       Top 5 Things I Like To Eat On My Way Home From A Bar      urlLink Pizza  - Ah, the old standby. You can't really go wrong with a nice, hot slice of Italian-American (or in my case, Canadian) Cheese-Sauce Bread. Halifax has pizza places up the ying yang, so I always have a wide variety to choose from. Usually I just end up at Pizza Corner (Blowers Street on Grafton, for you non-Haligonians out there) and get a slice from Sicilian. Try the BBQ Chicken.     urlLink Donairs  - Apparently the donair is a Halifax creation, although it is simply a modified version of the Mediterranean  urlLink doner kebab . Sure, the meat content of the donair is quite sketchy at best. Sure, donair sauce looks absolutely disgusting. Sure, donairs may well be one of the messiest foods to eat in history. Sure, your guts will hate you the next day for ingesting this strange combination of mystery meat, transluscent sauce, onions, and pita. All I know is, when I'm out "gettin' ma drink on", I often feel a strange desire to enter one of Halifax's many fine donair establishments and devour one or two of these culinary marvels.    urlLink McDonalds  - Yeah, I know, McDonalds may in fact be one of the absolute worst places a human being could ever eat, but I still get a BigMac jones every once in awhile. I'm pretty sure they sprinkle crack into all of their food, although I can't prove it. Going into a McDonalds drunk is one of the most dangerous things a person can ever do to themselves: "Umm, yeah, I'll have the Double Big Mac Meal, Super-sized, with a 20-pack of McNuggets, 2 Apple Pies, and a Chocolate Milkshake." You know you'll eat all of that shit, and afterwards you will pray to the gastro-intestinal gods to strike you down and end your suffering.    urlLink Meat On A Stick  - Anybody who reads this who has spent a night in downtown Halifax knows what I'm talking about. Just below Pizza Corner, on an inconspicuous little section of sidewalk, lies one of the greatest things known to man or beast,  Rocky's Filipino BBQ  (or simply  Meat On A Stick Guy ). Miscellaneaous, marinated meat (is it pork? beef? chicken? who knows? who cares!) barbequeued on skewers, then served in a bun (or  au natural ), with a dizzying array of condiments (I usually stick with hot sauce, garlic mayo, and onions). I couldn't find a link to this little corner of Heaven, so I just have a link to some recipe for generic Filipino kebabs. The recipe looks good, but the vegetables are superfluous. All you need is meat, pointy sticks, and a fire, and you're partying baby!    urlLink Kraft Dinner And Tuna Fish Surprise  - I had to throw this one in here in honour of my good friend and former drinking buddy Shannon McD. I lost count of the nights we (and whomever else was with us at the time) would stagger home (or stagger into a cab, anyway) from a bar, usually Tom's, and she would whip up a pot of this stuff. This was usually followed by watching either: a)a cheezy 80's movie, or b)a taped episode of  urlLink Buffy The Vampire Slayer . The recipe link is for some kind of casserole, but if you just take out every ingredient except for the KD and tuna, then you get this wonderfully disgusting late-night treat.     Honourable Mention : If my drinking escapades happen to occur in my old stomping grounds of  urlLink "beautiful downtown Sydney" , then I usually end up at a local favorite,  urlLink Jasper's . What can I say about Jasper's. Modern decor, always cheerful wait staff, well-mannered, quiet patrons, this place has it all! There's just something about having breakfast at 4:00 in the morning that gives me that special feeling way down in the cockles of my heart. Or maybe that's just the bacon and eggs. My new favorite menu item is "The Downhomer", which consists of 2 eggs, 2 fishcakes, baked beans, and 2 slices of toast. Delicious. I was actually banned from this establishment for a little while (but that's a story for another time).

      Last night I went to the launch party for  urlLink Pine Magazine  at  urlLink The Seahorse . There were some readings from the magazine, and some poetry (which was kind of weird, since usually all you see at The Seahorse is a bunch of crusty ol' punks and metalheads getting drunk and falling all over the place). The real reason I was there, however, was to catch one of my favorite bands,  urlLink Windom Earle . You can check out some of Stephan's stuff  urlLink here , or  urlLink here . The following is a  urlLink quote  from a review:   Windom earle is what happens when new age confronts pop in a dark alley and they go at it, bitchslapping each other silly until they make up and decide to be, like, y'know, best friends forever, and go shopping for cute outfits at the nearest mall.  Last night's set included a recent addition to the band, Dale Fahey (guitarist with The Spincycle Squared, and all around decent fella), who fit in quite nicely. The Windom Earle Karaoke Party was also in full effect last night, with Stephan doing his spirited rendition of  urlLink "Footloose" . A little bit a dancin', a little bit a drinkin', and a whole lot a funnin'. Indeed.

       Top 5 Actors Who Are Probably Actually Crazy       urlLink Christopher Walken  - This guy is an absolute nut. I think he is not of this world. No matter how the shitty the movie is (see  urlLink Gigli ), the guy always gives an engaging performance. Add to the fact that he's a great dancer, singer, and one of the best hosts  Saturday Night Live  has ever had (he has a standing invitation to host the show once a year, if he is available), and you have one of the most versatile actors going today. And to think, he was almost chosen to play Hans Solo in Star Wars. Ah, what could have been...    urlLink Jack Nicholson  - It is certainly no secret that old Jack has more than a few screws loose. The reason he plays crazies so well in film's is because, well, he IS crazy! From "Jack Torrance" in  urlLink The Shining , to "The Joker" in  urlLink Batman , everybody knows that if the part calls for an actor who can "bring the crazy", Mr. Nicholson is the go-to guy. He is also a close friend of  urlLink Hunter S. Thompson . That can never be a good sign.    urlLink Jeff Goldblum  - If you've ever seen Jeff Goldblum do an interview on a talk show, you'll understand why he is on this list. I saw him on  urlLink Late Night With Conan O'Brien  recently, and Goldblum spent the whole time talking about Conan's  skin . Funny and creepy at the same time.    urlLink Crispin Glover  - Dude has a collection of artifacts in his house related to  gynecology  and  mummification , and once tried to kick  urlLink David Letterman  in the head during a Late Night appearance for not showing enough interest in his insect collection. Homeboy is  tripping  on something, that's for sure.      urlLink John Malkovich  - MALKOVICH!!!

      So I was going to get a haircut after work yesterday, and during the walk (it takes about 7 minutes to get there from my place) I was hit up by 4 different  urlLink lemonade stands ! At first I was more than willing to part with 25 cents for a glass, since it was "hot as crotch" outside and I was thirsty. I bought a glass at the second stand because they were only charging 15 cents (mind you, the quality was severely lacking compared to the first stand). The third one was selling homemade, freshly squeezed lemonade, so I had to give that a try. I was now out of change , so I had to decline the offer from the fourth stand. The one thing I noticed about all of the stands is that the kids were so  pushy ! Jesus, I've talked to telemarketers who were less pushy than these kids! Some of the kids actually stepped into the middle of the sidewalk to get me to stop. These kids have to learn that you don't have to be pushy and aggressive to sell lemonade (although chumps like me will still buy it, apparently). All you need is a hot, sunny day, a good location, a hand-written sign that has spelling mistakes and/or backwards letters, and your cutest, "Ah shucks, golly gee" facial expression. Just watch the money roll in. Seriously, who can resist some darling little raggamuffin hawking low-grade lemonade at 15 cents a pop?     urlLink Batter up!   urlLink Mmmm, tasty!   urlLink Vinyl Is Dead

      A while back somebody showed me this website,  urlLink The Way Of The Master , and I feel that it is important enough to share with you, my valued readers. The generosity just oozes out of me (man, that sounds gross). From the title, I thought it was going to be some crazy kung-fu type stuff, and that I would finally learn how to  urlLink harness my chi  and learn how to vanquish my enemies with "The Touch Of Death", or "The Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique". What I found instead was nothing less stupifying and mystical that what I had originally thought. All I can say about it is that it involves  urlLink Kirk Cameron  (yes,  that  Kirk Cameron), and it has changed my life. Enjoy.

      From the "Praise Jeebus I Don't Live There Department":  Apparently the gods are angry in Honolulu, since the Mount Kilauea eruptions have prompted a new series of  urlLink lava warnings .  LAVA WARNINGS ! What the fuck! I mean, yeah, okay, we had a pretty bad hurricane here last fall (by Nova Scotia standards), and we also had a pretty tough winter, but  lava warnings ! I'm never going to complain about the weather situation here again. I'm just thankful that I don't live  on top of a massive volcano that could friggin' blow up any day now and cover my village in friggin' lava .  If you're ever in Honolulu and feel like watching some lava, here are some tips: Lava safety tips   • Stay inside the National Park Service's rope perimeter.  • Do not go near the water and do not enter bench areas. Stay at least a quarter-mile inland.  • Move inland quickly if you hear cracking or booming sounds or other unusual noises.  Source: U.S. Geological Survey  From  urlLink Fark.com

       urlLink    To break up the monotony, here's a photo. The Dude on the left is Bad News Brown (or Bad News Allen, depending on who you talk to), and the dude on the right is The Cuban Assassin. The Cuban Assassin was a fixture in Grand Prix Wrestling, Atlantic Canada's longest running wrestling promotion. When I was a kid, I thought that my Dad looked like the Cuban Assassin. In retrospect, if my dad had let his hair and beard go crazy, dropped about 60-70 pounds, had a deeper tan, and wore wrestling boots, then maybe he would have looked like him. My dad did often have that "crazed" look in his eyes sometimes, but that's another story altogether.&nbsp; urlLink

      You know, it's pretty sad that the most exciting thing going on in my life at this very moment is that I'm getting a new CPU fan installed in my computer. I'm also thinking about upgrading from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows XP Professional. I'm also a huge nerd.   *Update* : So I find out that while trying to remove my old fan I irreparably damaged my processor, and I have to buy a new one. Granted, my processor is about 3 years old and was due for an upgrade anyway, (I'm going from an Athlon Thunderbird 850 MHz chip to an Athlon XP 2200 MHz chip - that's computer nerd speak for " My 'puter's gonna be a shitload faster, wha. "), but it's still annoying.

       Friday Night : After work Friday I went straight to the booze store to purchase the required supplies to make one of the drinks I featured on Friday's post, The Nomad (I used  urlLink Bombay Sapphire  gin instead of Vodka, however). A couple of those bad boys and I was in quite a good mood. Then it was off to Tom's Little Havana for my usual Friday evening revelry. After Tom's, I went a few blocks over to Halifax's newest music venue,  urlLink Stage Nine , where  urlLink Slowcoaster  were playing. This was probably about the millionth time I've seen them, roundabouts. The crowd was pretty thin at first, but things picked up towards the end. I danced for a good hour or so, so I must have been pretty drunk. The bar has a great patio, and I had some excellent conversations out there with Devon Strang's sister (I can never remember her name) and Shaun Purdy (we had a solid 15 minute discussion about  urlLink Andre The Giant ). Oh, and some weird girl (who was completely wasted, knackered, three sheets to the wind) kept on trying to dance (read: grope) with me. That sucked, so I solved the problem by dancing over to the edge of the dancefloor, where I noticed a lone, drunk, dancing male, and then quickly saying "I need another drink.", or something to that effect, and jetting off to the bar. By the time I got my drink, I could see that the lone male and the crazy weird girl were in the middle of what could only be classified as "PG-13 style heavy petting", so my crisis was averted (I'm just like Cupid, only a little different).   Saturday :  urlLink Giselle , Debra, and myself checked out  urlLink Greek Fest  over on Purcell's Cove Rd. Some meat on stick, shitty beer, decent wine, funny dancing in strange costumes. A good time was had by all. After that we headed over to the  urlLink Oxford  to see  urlLink Super Size Me , which was fantastic, by the way. The movie has put me off fast food for at least a month or so, however (or maybe until the end of the week, who knows).   Sunday : My roomate Mike and I decided to go golfing Sunday afternoon, so we got in the Volkswagon (thank the lord for roomates with cars!) and headed out. He said that he thought there was a course out on Purcell's Cove Rd., but after a good solid 15-20 minutes of driving out there, we still couldn't find one. Instead we found a 200 year old naval fortress. Along the highway we saw this weird concrete wall, and our natural curiousity drew us to investigate. We saw a clearing in the forest for a walking path, so we parked the car and headed out. What we had stumbled upon was  urlLink York Redoubt , an old fortress that was built in the 1800's to protect Halifax Harbour. For a couple of history nerds like us, it was pretty cool indeed. Afterwards we headed downtown to  urlLink The Old Triangle  for some Sunday afternoon refreshment. We ended up watching most of the England-France  urlLink European Cup  soccer (ahem... I mean  football ) game, drinking our lager and feeling like right football hooligans. I ended the night by again going to the theater to see  urlLink The Stepford Wives . There were a few funny bits, but this didn't illicit too many laughs from yours truly. Also, whoever edited the movie should be taken out back to the learnin' tree for a severe whoopin', because I thought that the overall flow of the movie was terrible. Ah well, can't win em' all, I guess.   Quite the action packed weekend, and I'm sure that you were all riveted by my colourfull account of it. Envy me and my busy social schedule (ha)! Now I can't wait for the  urlLink Multicultural Festival  in Dartmouth next weekend!

       Top 5 Carbonated Beverages (With Bonus Drink Recipes!)       urlLink Coca Cola  - Still the champ after all these years, no matter what those Pepsi loving freaks will tell you. And don't listen to anybody who tells you those stupid stories about leaving a nail or a t-bone steak in a dish full of Coke overnight, and in the morning they're GONE! That's complete  urlLink bulldung .  urlLink Wayne Gretzky  also used to endorse Coke. If it's good enough for Wayne, it's good enough for me.    Drink: Cuba Libre   2 oz Light rum  Juice of 1/2 Lime  Coca-Cola   Pour lime juice into a highball glass over ice cubes. Add rum, fill with cola, stir, and serve.      urlLink Fresca  - Brought to you by the good people at Coca Cola, Fresca is a caffeine-free  grapefruit flavoured  citrus soft drink. Grapefruit flavoured! My love of carbonation and my love of grapefruits together at long last, all in a handy 355 ml aluminum can! Don't be fooled by the  urlLink Sprites  of the world, this shit is the bomb refreshing citrus beverage. For reals, yo.      Drink: The Nomad   4 oz Lemonade  1 oz Vodka  1 oz Fresca  dash Grenadine   Mix vodka, lemonade and fresca and serve over ice, add dash of grenadine.      urlLink Ginger Ale  - Ginger ale is just fantastic stuff, in that it's carbonated, but can sometimes actually settle your stomach. This is almost a necessity for the home bartender.     Drink: Headless Horseman   2 oz Vodka  3 dashes Bitters  Ginger ale  1 slice Orange   Put vodka and bitters into a collins glass. Add several ice cubes, fill with ginger ale, and stir. Add the orange slice and serve.      urlLink Tonic Water  - The other half of a Gin And Tonic. Nuff said.    Drink: Gin And Tonic   2 oz Gin  5 oz Tonic water  1 Lime wedge   Pour the gin and the tonic water into a highball glass almost filled with ice cubes. Stir well. Garnish with the lime wedge.      urlLink Champagne  - Since I usually can't afford to buy ACTUAL champagne, I'm usually stuck drinking "sparkling wines", but "any port in a storm", as the saying goes. I think the bubbles go straight to your brain and get lodged in there, instantly turning you into a babbling, giggly idiot. Good stuff. Buy a cheap bottle of sparkling wine, get a few oysters on the halfshell, and pretend your at some five-star hotel on the French Riviera (instead of your stank ass living room filled with McDonald's wrappers and two-day old dishes).    Drink: Fizzy Fuzzy Navel   1 1/2 oz Peach schnapps  2 oz Orange juice  Fill with Champagne   Pour Schnapps and OJ over 2 ice cubes. Fill with Champagne and stir gently.      All drink recipes brought to you by  urlLink Webtender .

      For absolutley no reason at all I began thinking about  urlLink Norm McDonald  today. You know, renowned Canadian comedian and former Weekend Update news anchor on  urlLink Saturday Night Live . It may have something to do with the fact that I actually watched SNL this weekend for the first time in a long time. There used to be a time when I wouldn't miss an episode of Saturday night, with Norm's Weekend Update usually being the highlight for me. Remember when  urlLink Chris Farley  was still alive and coherent. When  urlLink Dana Carvey  hadn't yet made  urlLink Master of Disguise . When  urlLink Mike Myers  was still funny. Now I'm lucky if I catch one episode a month. Ah, the good ol' days.  In honour of Norm, here is a link to the homepage of one of his favorite celebrities. Whom, you may ask? You guessed it:  urlLink Frank Stallone .

      It's like 30 degrees here in Halifax today! Usually I would be complaining that it's too hot and muggy, but considering the absolutley horrendous weather we've been getting round these parts recently, I'll shut my mouth. It's about time to go to the Pitch And Putt in Fairview to get some golfing in! (The Pitch And Putt isn't  exactly  REAL golf - all of the holes are Par 3, the longest being about 90 yards or so, and you only need 2 clubs, a putter and a pitching wedge, hence the name. It does have a driving range and mini-putt, so it's all good though. Plus, I completely suck at golf, so there's not much point in going to a nice, expensive golf course.)     urlLink This Swedish dude  made this thing where you can type in English song lyrics, and it will sing them back to you (providing of course the word is in the database). Nice little timewaster this is.

      Wow, Halifax actually had a weekend with two full days of nice weather! The apocalypse must be near. Hopefully we'll be back to grey, cold, drizzly days soon.   Tumbleweed was fairly entertaining on Saturday. I was able to catch sets by  urlLink The Spincycle Squared ,  urlLink Jon Epworth ,  The Special Noise ,  urlLink The Hold , and  The Hemingways . Good, clean, Rock N' Roll fun was had by all. As  urlLink Pete Townshend  said, "The kids are alright." The fun had at the concert was negated later on that evening after watching the Calgary Flames go down in double-overtime to the Tampa Bay Lighting. Game 7 is tonight - I still think the Flames can pull it off.   On Sunday, myself, Mike, and Carlos (one of Mike's co-workers from  urlLink da Maurizio's ), went on a little excursion to  urlLink Peggy's Cove  to get some lobsters. Now, even though I was born and raised here in good ol' Nova Scotia, I can honestly say that I do not feel some mystical connection to the sea. Mind you, I grew up in  urlLink Sydney , and while Sydney is a port town, it's a far cry from some  urlLink quaint fishing village . I have to say though, that when we got to Peggy's Cove and just sat there on the rocks for a few minutes, it got me to thinkin' about this little province I live in. I find it hard to imagine what it would be like living somewhere where you aren't in close proximity to the sea. Going to places like Peggy's Cove reminds me that I was indeed born in a special little corner of the world. It's enough to make a man misty eyed. Now excuse me while I go drink some rum and sing  urlLink sea shanties . Yar.

       Top 5 Nacho Toppings       urlLink  Cheese   - An absolute necessity for nachos. Preferrably it should be cheddar, but mozzarella or Monteray Jack will do in a pinch. I even like the neon orange movie theatre cheese stuff.     urlLink  Hot Peppers   - I loves me some hot peppers. Jalapenos, banana peppers, Anaheim chilies, you name it. I wouldn't recommend  urlLink Habanero  chilies for nachos though, unless you like the feeling of SEARING HOT FIREY PAIN in your gullet.     urlLink  Onions   - Many people dislike onions (especially raw) because of their strong taste and their penchant for giving you bad breath, but I love the stinky bastards!     urlLink  Green Bell Peppers   - I love green (and red, yellow, and orange) peppers so much, I could eat them raw, just like an apple. In fact, I believe I have, on a few drunken occassions.     urlLink  Chicken   - If you absolutely must have meat on your nachos, make sure you skip the traditional ground beef in favour of chicken. Trust me. If you want ground beef, get a bowl of chili, punk. Besides, this way you won't get  urlLink mad cow disease .    I didn't have salsa or sour cream on the list, because I am a huge believer that those should always be served on the side, lest your nachos get all soggy and shit. And stop putting the black olives on nachos. Seriously! Who started that trend anyways? Leave the black olives for your Greek salad. Word.

       I'm 25 years old biotches!  Here are some other people who have the same birthday as me:     urlLink  Lalaine   - Apparently she acted alongside  urlLink Her Duffness  in that crappy  urlLink Lizzie McGuire  TV show. I hate that show. She also only uses one name. That, my friends, is the definition of  lame .    urlLink  Suzi Quatro   - Apparently this pop-rocker chick was big in the 70's. And she once had an acting stint on  urlLink Happy Days . The parade of mediocre celebrities who share my birthday continues!    urlLink  Tony Curtis   - Tony's a famous actor, who has appeared in such films as  urlLink Some Like It Hot ,  urlLink The Defiant Ones , and  urlLink Lobster Man From Mars . He's also the father of  urlLink Jamie Lee Curtis . Okay, we're moving up a bit here.    urlLink  Curtis Mayfield   - Now we're talking! Curtis was one of the greatest soul musicians of all time, with songs like "Pusherman", "Freddie's Dead", and "Superfly".    urlLink  Allen Ginsberg   - The world famous Beat poet, who penned such poems as  urlLink "Howl"  and  urlLink "America" . Far out.    urlLink  Charles Richard Drew   - He was an American doctor who was responsible for organizing the concept of a blood bank. Not too shabby.    urlLink  Jefferson Davis   - Old Civil War dude. In 1861, he was elected "provisional" president of the "provisional" Congress of the Confederate States. He also lobbied for a revival of the slave trade. Well, I guess everybody you share your birthday with can't be all nice and fuzzy.

       Top 5 Movie Quotes (that I can remember at this very moment)   If I did this list again 10 minutes from now, these would probably all be different, but here are 5 good movie quotes that popped into my head.       "I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum."  - Nada, played by Roddy Piper, from  urlLink They Live    I remember nothing from this obscure late 80's sci-fi action movie, except for this line. Someday I will find an opportunity to use this line, and it's gonna be so rad.     "Listen. You smell something?  - Dr. Ray Stantz, played by Dan Akroyd, from  urlLink Ghostbusters    This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It probably was the first movie my parents ever bought my brother and I. I've seen it more times than I can count, and this line never fails to get a laugh out of me. A close second in the Ghostbuster quote contest has to be Winston Zeddemore's classic line,  "I have seen shit that'll turn you white!      "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."  - Jules, played by Samuel L. Jackson, from  urlLink Pulp Fiction   This one just had to make it on here. This is of course the fictional bible passage that Jules recites, right before he and Vincent get all "gangsta" on poor Brett (he of the Big Kahuna Burger and the big brain). If I could ever grow my hair into an afro like Jackson's, I would have done so years ago. He is indeed, a "bad muthafucka".     "Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy, or are you gonna bite?"  - Mr. Blonde, played by Michael Madsen, from  urlLink Reservoir Dogs   Another Tarantino movie, go figure? Michael Madsen's bread and butter is playing "the bad ass", and folks, it don't get no more bad ass than that line. This is another line that I would love to use in real life, but probably will never get the chance to. Chances are, if I did ever use it, that would probably end up being the last thing I ever say.     "Wake-y wake-y, eggs and bac-y."  - Bud, played by Michael Madsen, from  urlLink Kill Bill: Vol. 2   Tarantino again, and Michael Madsen again. This is what Bud says to The Bride (Uma Thurman), just after she wakes up from her rock-salt induced mini-coma.  I have absolutely no idea why I like this line so much, but it's been stuck in my head ever since I saw Vol.2 in the theatre. There are so many great lines in this movie, and this is the one that stood out for me. Don't ask why.     urlLink This dude  tried his own  urlLink McDonald's  experiment, ala  urlLink Supersize Me , but instead of gaining weight, he actually lost weight. Hmmm. I don't know who to believe, but all of a sudden I have a definite hankering for a Quarter Pounder With Cheese.  Wish me luck with my crazy drunk relatives in C.B. this weekend! I'm out this bitch...

      So I hear through the grapevine that the one and only Kid Rock cancelled his Atlantic Canadian dates this summer (including the upcoming show right here in Halifax). Apparently, everybody remembered that  Kid Rock = Audio Diarrhea , so nobody bought any tickets. Excuse me while I go cry a little cry. Sniff.  Speaking of "The American Badass",  urlLink do you have bad taste in music?   Want to check out some random Internet dudes opinions on all sorts of entertainment media thingys, then why not go over  urlLink here  for a spell. Go on, it'll be okay. C'mon, little trooper...  It looks like I'll be in Cape Breton ( urlLink Margaree , to be exact) this upcoming long weekend. It's part Gillis family reunion (apparently there are relatives coming in from parts of the U.S., and even Vancouver), part book launch. The book is a collection of songs and poems by my great-grandfather, Malcolm Gillis. After some Googling, I found this little piece of info, written by my aunt Margaret for the  urlLink West Word news , a Scottish community newsletter:   From Morar To Margaree by Margaret E Gillis  My Story of My Grandfather, Malcolm Hugh Gillis  Malcolm H Gillis, my grandfather, was a Gaelic poet known as 'The Margaree Bard'. He was born, grew up and raised his own family, in the so very beautiful 'Margarees' - a part of Canada's Cape Breton Island, known for its scenic and tranquil beauty. His father, Hugh Gillis,was 3 years old when he came to Canada from Morar, Scotland and settled with his parents Angus and Margaret Gillis in South West Margaree on Cape Breton Island's west side.   Malcolm wrote both Gaelic and English poetry and songs. He is, however, more well known for his Gaelic Songs than his English ones - which I think are very beautiful also, because I have a great love of poetry. I am told that some of his Gaelic songs are known in Scotland - especially the islands where Gaelic is still spoken. Malcolm Gillis had a great love for everything that was 'Scottish'.  A beautiful love song, 'Nighean Donn A Chuil Reidh', was written by him in praise of a lady who he much admired, but did not marry. Her ancestors were also from Scotland. I have a tape of my father singing this song, accompanied by my mother on piano, at a Gaelic Concert called 'Oidhche Leis Na Baird' on Cape Breton Island, in 1974. My father explains to the audience that he had recently met Calum Kennedy at a Rebecca Cohn concert in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Mr Kennedy had told him that he had won a medal singing this same song.     'Am Braighe', another composition, was in praise of the scenic and tranquil beauty surrounding him, in the picturesque countryside where he lived.  Totally inspired, deep from within, by the power of the nature around him, he expresses the sincere and true love that he felt for his beloved 'Braes' of Margaree. It was a gaelic song that I heard often, sung by my father in my own home as my mother accompanied him on piano - or as he often did, accompanied himself. That has left a musical memory and a musical memory is a beautiful memory.  A collection of my grandfather's work was published in 'Smeorach Nan Cnoc's Nan Gleann' in 1939 by Alexander MacLaren & Sons, Glasgow, Scotland.  A pipe tune by him, named The New Year, was published in The David Glen Piping Collection in Scotland at the turn of the last century. He played various instruments - organ, pipes, and violin. During a trip to the United States to visit family, he entered a violin competition, where he won two silver cups.  Presently, I am a member of a committee (started in 2002 by a cousin) that is compiling all Gaelic and English poetry, songs and essays, as well as any music, written by our grandfather. This will include the work previously published in 1939 accompanied by English translation, plus previously unpublished works. We are having a Tribute to him on 1st August 2004 in South West Margaree, Cape Breton Island - the very same place to where his father, Hugh, immigrated in 1821. My cousin's wish is to make all his work available to his descendants in a book . On that day, the book will be available to the descendants and invited guests for $15.00 / book. Any profit made from this book is to be used to create a high school scholarship called, The Malcolm H Gillis Memorial Scholarship For Recognition of Excellence In Any One Of The Following:  Scottish Gaelic, Poetry, Essays, Music, Songs, Dance  I have great interest in other people's opinion of my grandfather, Malcolm. One that I will always remember was written by Norman MacDonald, former Professor of Celtic Studies at University College of Cape Breton, Sydney, Nova Scotia, and presently with BBC Scotland on The Isle of Skye. It reads....  'Gillis deserves wider recognition as by far the best nature poet writing anywhere in Gaelic between 1830 and 1930. I also think that he should have high place among Canadian Literary figures of this century.'  I did not personally know my grandfather, Malcolm...only through my father, uncles and aunts did I know him....and, of course through his poetry. I do believe, however, that he would have felt highly honoured by Norman MacDonald's words. I leave you now with an English verse written by my grandfather, about Margaree Island.   Oh! fall gentle showers that nature empowers  To soothe a young flower in bower and lea  Come sunshine that pleases, blow soft gentle breezes  Around This Green Island That Rests In The Sea  To all I leave this Celtic Wish ........  Slainte Mhath Agus Sonas (Good Health and Happiness)

       Friday:     4:30 PM - 10:00 PM :  Got drunk (pickled, FUBARed, jagged up, wired to the tits, Boris Yeltsinned, tore up from the floor up, Kennedied, blotto, locked out of my mind) at the CS Society weekly Geekbeer.    10:15 PM - 2:30 AM :  From there I headed over to the  urlLink Marquee  to catch  urlLink Slainte Mhath . They were great, as usual. Downstairs in  urlLink Hell , a band called Sharp Like Knives was playing. They were also good. Chatted with Alfred for a bit (as usual), and had some pizza. The pizza in Hell's Kitchen is the shiznit.    Saturday:    5:30-10:30ish :  Went to the concert on Citadel Hill with a friend from work and a few of his friends. It was rainy, and I was soaked, but it wasn't too bad.  urlLink Matt Mays & El Torpedo  were great, and  urlLink Hawksley Workman  was okay too, I guess. I'm not really into his music, but at least he is a captivating performer. He certainly grabs an audiences attention (sometimes he goes a tad overboard with the theatrics, but I can let that slide). Hawksley certainly has his share of female fans, however. I know this because I was almost crushed to death when a throng of them bowled me over on their way to the front of the stage. At the end of his set, I mentioned to one of them that he should've have thrown the socks that he had stuffed in his crotch into the crowd, and she gave me the  urlLink evil eye . I immediately apologized for my wisecrack against Mr. Workman's manly endowment (heh heh), then yelled quite loudly towards the stage, "Hawksley, I want you to touch my bathing suit area!!" This got quite a few laughs from most of the concert-goers in the immediate vicinity, but the "evil eye" girl told me to, and I quote, "Fuck off, loser!" So I did. The beer tent sucked (Coors Light is wack), but I had a few beer anyway. The headline act was  urlLink Jim Cuddy , of  urlLink Blue Rodeo  fame. We didn't stay for most of his set, but from what I heard, he should probably just change the name of his band to "New Rodeo", because I couldn't tell the difference.   Sunday:    10:00 AM - 9:00 PM :  Did Sweet Fuck All.   9:30 PM - 11:30 PM :  Saw  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy . I enjoyed it. If you like fast-paced, car chase, puncy-kicky movies that have confusing plots and crazy editing, go see it. If you don't like those kinds of movies, stop being such a panty-waist bee-otch and see it anyways. Or just go and see  urlLink The Notebook  or some such shit. Whatever.

       Top 5 Muppets      Beaker   I always felt bad for poor Beaker, because he would always end up getting blown up or some such thing, due to Prof. Bunsen Honeydew's shitty experiments. And despite all of that, Beaker still stood by Bunsen, helping him carry out various experiments that would invariably end quite painfully for poor Beaker. Plus, he talked in a series of "meeps", "moops", and "beeps", and that was pretty funny.     The Swedish Chef   For years I actually thought that Swedish people talked like this. I wish they actually did talk like this. This guy was nothing short of a guaranteed laugh. So, apparently, my two favorite muppets were the ones who made the least amount of sense. I wonder what that says about me?     Waldorf & Statler   The ultimate "peanut gallery" hecklers. These guys were just plain sarcastic, cantankerous, and generally mean spirited. Here at the Computer Science building, we've named two of our servers after them. Yes, we are huge nerds.     Animal   The drummer for the band  urlLink Dr. Teeth And The Electric Mayhem , Animal was another non-sensical Muppet that I liked. He's sort of like Cookie Monster from Sesame Street, but instead of cookies, Animal likes to play drums and smash things. Much more cooler than cookies.     Crazy Harry   Anytime anybody on the show mentioned anything even remotely related to bombs or explosions, this crazy mutherfucker would pop out of nowhere and blow shit up. I cannot even begin to stress the awesomeness of that concept.

      Yesterday my roomate convinced me to try a delicacy that, up until this point in my life, I have never felt the urge to try. The  Pogo Stick . For the few of you out there who don't know what a Pogo Stick is, it basically consists of a hot dog on a stick, dipped in batter. Let me repeat that:  it basically consists of a hot dog on a stick, dipped in batter . Now, as horrible as that sounded to me, I am always game to try out new and exciting foodstuffs, so I bit the bullet and tucked in to a Pogo. If you are an intelligent human being and have never eaten one of these, this is what they look like:     The first bite was like Neil Armstrong stepping onto the moon... "one small step for man, one giant leap for Iain's tastebuds." How does it taste, you ask. Well, it tastes exactly like a battered frankfurter on a stick. Use your imagination. Covering it with mustard alleviated the pain somewhat, but I can pretty much some with some degree of certainty that it was the first  and  last Pogo I have ever eaten. Luckily, I had a nice, cold bottle of  urlLink Miller Genuine Draft  to wash it down, so it wasn't all bad.  My next step is to find a supermarket that still sells  urlLink sprayable cheese . Just imagine, a Pogo topped with sprayable cheese... it almost boggles the mind.

      Friday night was spent at  urlLink The Marquee , where I saw this band called  urlLink The Waco Brothers . The Waco Brothers are a Chicago-based punk-country-rock-funtime band that includes members of  urlLink The Mekons ,  urlLink Jesus Jones , and  urlLink KMFDM , among other bands. These dudes are all middle-aged or quickly approaching middle-age, yet they played with more energy than any group of 20somethings I've seen in recent memory. Apparently they were flown in just for this night, courtesy of some guy named Jeff Cohen (he is from Toronto and runs/owns/has something important to do with  urlLink Lee's Palace  and The Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. He was getting married to some chick from Eastern Passage, and the show was kinda like a pre-wedding party or something. At one point, one of the guys from the Waco Brothers asked the crowd if they knew any popular Nova Scotian wedding chants, and the only replies he got were, "Whoo, whoo!", and "Show us your scrotum!" So, he spent the rest of the show randomly yelling, "Whoo, whoo, show us your scrotum!" I had a ball. I also saw  urlLink Eugene Ripper  downstairs. He was pretty decent as well. To top it all off, I didn't even have a hangover the next day. Good times all around.

      During lunch today I decided to go down to the Asian grocery near work and browse around for some snacks. Asian (especially Japanese) snack foods have always intrigued me, as they are usually, how should I put this, more "eclectic" than our snacks over here in Canadiana. I started out slow today by trying out  urlLink Tomato Pretz . These things are thin, breadsticky-pretzel type dealies, coated in a salty flavouring agent. While the tomato flavour was far from overpowering, these guys are pretty good. There are some  strange  ingredients listed though:  isomerized sugar  (wha?),  chicken extract  (gah?),  apple juice powder  (zah?). Maybe tomorrow I'll finally try  urlLink Pocky . I was intrigued by this package of  urlLink wasabi flavoured roasted peas , but I don't think that I'm nearly that brave yet.

      Since I'm part Frenchy myself (thanks Mom), I'd like to extend to you and yours my best wishes on this Bastille Day! For anybody who would like to celebrate  urlLink the storming of the Bastille  and the beginning of the First Republic, here are some handy dandy  urlLink drink recipes .   Apparently some Mexican government and law enforcement officials are having chips  urlLink implanted into their arms  that will allow their movements to be tracked, as well as giving them access to a national crime data bank. Now I'm no  urlLink Luddite , but this kind of creeps me out. Just a little bit.   So professional sports may be coming back to Halifax. Possibly. The  urlLink World Hockey Association  is planning to take advantage of the possible NHL lock-out this fall and bring affordable pro hockey back to the people. Or so they would have you believe. Halifax's contribution to the league will be the recently named  urlLink Halifax Ice Breakers . Ugh. The team doesn't have a deal with the Metro Centre yet (just an "understanding"), they won't have a list of players to negotiate with until the draft in a few days, there is no coach or general manager signed, and no head office yet in the city. The league is supposed to start in late October.  Riiight . On the WHA website, the team listing for the the inaugural season includes Detroit, Halifax, Miami, Quebec, Toronto, Hamilton, and my favorite,  Dallas or Vancouver . If this league ever gets off the ground, I give it one season. Two tops.    After reading this, I began to have flashbacks to another fledgling league, the ill-fated  urlLink National Basketball League . This league featured a handfull of Canadian teams, including the Halifax Windjammers and of course, my own hometown Cape Breton Breakers (get it... Breakers, like a fast break in basketball, or Breakers like a wave, like the waves in the water around Cape Breton... how clever). The league lasted about one and a half seasons, but I have found memories of Sydney's brief journey into the realm of pro hoops. I remember on opening night, way back in 1993, my friend's and I had floor seats, right behind the visiting teams bench (Hamilton, I believe). The pre-game festivities included the Barra MacNeils doing the anthem, and a procession of bagpipes (it's Cape Breton, what else would there be?). After the pipers came in, one of the Hamilton players, a guy by the name of Clifford Lett (who actually played a handfull of NBA games with Chicago and San Antonio), turned back towards us and said, "Yo fellas, is this some sort of hockey thing, or somthin?" He was immediately our favorite player in the league. Everytime Hamilton came into town, we would make Clifford Lett signs and cheer as loud as possible whenever he so much as touched the ball. We of course had our favorites on the Breakers as well. Willie McDuffie was my favorite, an overweight, ageing centre, who was slow as molasses, but had a decent 3-point shot. I loved that team. They actually made it to the league finals. Alas, it was not meant to be.

      Saturday night was spent at the  urlLink Pogue Fado . Despite that, I actually had decent time (although my constant barrage of complaints against  urlLink the music , the horrible bathroom line-ups, and the weird "linear" layout of the bar may have led some people to believe otherwise). You see, I can enjoy myself in almost ANY type of bar, as long as the company is good (and/or the booze is cheap enough). I am far from a bar-elitist. "Any port in a storm.", as the saying goes. That being said, this bar has all of the worst traits of the shittier bars back in Sydney, so needless to say, I probably won't become a regular at this place. If you live in Halifax, or plan to visit, and want to go to an Irish style pub, go to  urlLink The Old Triangle  instead. Sit down at the bar in front of the stage, order up a pint of Harp (or  urlLink Guinness , if that's your poison) and the Curry & Chips, and pretend your not in Halifax but a quaint little local pub in  urlLink County Cork  or someplace. They did show some weird rodeo thingy on the TV above the bar though, so that was cool.   Go see  urlLink Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy , the new Will Ferell movie. I was almost in  tears  at some parts. I may even go see it again. Best comedy of the year so far.

      While I was at  urlLink Th Attic  last night listening to  urlLink The Hemingways , I ran into my good buddy  urlLink Alfred . He's trying a  crazy experiment  that involves seeing how long he can go without drinking. I briefly considered the notion, then I ordered another beer. I fucking suck.   I went to Mary's Food Corner today for lunch, only to find out that the restuarant is changing hands. This was a bummer, until I found out that it was being replaced with a Chinese restuarant. They are in the middle of the changeover, and had some Chinese food on the menu. I got the  urlLink Kung Po Chicken . It ruled. I am no longer bummed. However, I suddenly have a strange craving for pineapple chicken and Jar Doo chicken wings. Oh yeah,  EAT AT LAM'S.    During lunch Mary's was playing the radio ( urlLink C100 FM ), and  urlLink "Total Eclipse Of The Heart"  by Bonnie Tyler came on. Now I can't get it out of my head. This sucks balls.   Somebody at the bar last night starting talking about Wheelies, the roller skating place Sydney had in the 80's. I'm not sure what it was called in your town, but  every  city or town probably had one of these. I have a theory that these places only existed because some shitty DJ had nothing better to do with his  urlLink Styx ,  urlLink Journey , and  urlLink Air Supply  records. This one time at Wheelies my brother fell down in the middle of the rink, and some dude ran over  his face . True story.    Top 5 Dishes At Lam's Restaurant (My favorite Chinese Restaurant)      urlLink Pineapple Chicken  - My good friend Shamus Blair never gets anything else when he goes to Lam's, and since he is a man of refined taste, I trust his judgement. You can have your vanilla, plain-Jane Sweet And Sour Chicken. This is the real shit, yo.    urlLink Jar Doo Chicken Wings  - In a city in which there is a "Wing Night" at random bars every night, these are still my vote for the best wings in Sydney. True dat.    urlLink Cantonese Chow Mein  - One of Minh's specialties, this stuff is to regular Chow Mein as Saved By The Bell is to Saved By The Bell: The College Years, ya heard me?!    urlLink Beef And Broccoli  - A classic. Beef is good. Broccoli is good. Beef And Broccoli is good.    urlLink Almond Gai Ding  - If it wasn't for this and the good people at  urlLink Glosettes , I would never have a reason to eat almonds.

      During lunch today, a co-worker and I began waxing nostalgic over old T.V. shows from the 80's. One of the shows that came up was  urlLink WKRP . You all remember WKRP right? Herb, Venus Flytrap, Les Nesman, that dude who plays the Maytag repairman. I used to love that show, despite all of its late 70's/early 80's cheeziness. My co-worker mentioned that one of the main drawing points of the show to him as a teenager was Loni Anderson and her ridiculously tight-fitting wardrobe. I made the off-hand remark that I was more of a  urlLink Bailey Quarters  fan, and he instantly began laughing at me. I thought that it was common knowledge that Jan Smithers (the actress who played Bailey) was more attractive than Loni Anderson, and he replied with, "Man, it's those HUGE glasses! And her wardrobe couldn't have been more boring." So we preceeded to have one of those classic, utterly stupid, "Who's hotter than who?" arguments. Only guys seem to get into these. You know, "Ginger or Mary-Anne?", "Britney or Christina?", "Counsellor Troi or Dr. Crusher?", that sort of thing. I'm not sure who came out on top in our argument, but I'll leave you with this  urlLink piece of evidence . I think the choice is obvious.

      I went to  urlLink Stage Nine  last night to take in some open mic action. This bar is quickly becoming one of my favorites in Halifax. Good music, good service, cheap (or no) cover. What more could you ask for? I showed up at the advertised start time of 9:00 PM, but of course, we all know that advertised start times are  rarely  accurate. To pass the time I sat outside at the patio bar and conversed with some of the staff. They played the  urlLink Beastie Boys  album "Licensed To Ill" in its entirety, which was awesome. The waitress recommended I try a drink called "Love Potion Number 9", which I believe was made with vodka, melon liquor, orange juice, and something else. Despite the bartender's warnings that it was "a girlie drink", I was game, so I ordered one. Then I ordered two more. Needless to say, I didn't feel 100% this morning. Ah well, such is the price for having a good time, I suppose. Anyhow, it's a good bar. Go there. Yup.

      Well, it was a fairly uneventful weekend. I saw these movies:   urlLink Spiderman 2  (in the theatre)  urlLink Apocalypse Now Redux  (on video)  urlLink The Fog Of War  (on video)  urlLink Independence Day  (on TV)  Two thumbs up for Spidey 2. Two mildly disturbed thumbs up for Apocalypse Now Redux. 1 mildly bored, mildly skeptical thumb up for The Fog Of War. Independence Day still sucks (although Jeff Goldblum plays a weird science dude in it, so it does have that going for it).    urlLink Kid Rock  is playing at the Halifax Metro Centre in August. I can hardly contain myself. I was thinking about going, but I think I might just save myself $53.50 and just jam a fork in my ear canal instead.    Get your chef on!   urlLink The Urban Peasant  - To check out the recipes, you have to register for the site. Don't worry though, I registered like 3 years ago, and have only received about 5 emails from then since. James Barber likes to put  booze  in his food. A lot. And probably not just in his food, either.   urlLink Yan Can Cook  - I used to love this guys show as a kid. Yan's got crazy ninja skills with his cleaver. On his show he used to always dump the scraps underneath the counter and pretend he was feeding them to his brother. He's still my all-time favorite TV chef.

      I started out Canada Day by sleeping in to 11:00 (that's late for me). I then went to the  urlLink Athens Restaurant  for lunch. I got the  urlLink Lamb Souvlakia  plate, in honour of Canada's multicultural heritage. Not really, I just like Greek food is all. I then went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  at the Oxford. Watching that film on Canada Day was quite fitting, as it made me feel very thankful that I was born in this country, despite the fact that we are responsible for  urlLink Celine Dion  and  urlLink polar bears  chase me to work everyday. This was followed by an impromptu BBQ at my friend Debra's house in Dartmouth. Debra was uspet that I didn't mention her in my blog very much, so here goes: Debra has a nice old dog named Cleo, she gave us all  urlLink Sweet Tarts , and enjoys chicken hot dogs. Tune in next week for more interesting Debra trivia! (just kidding Debbie.) The fireworks on the waterfront were pretty standard, but anything that can cause thousands of people to go "oooh" and "aaah" in unison is pretty cool in my book. Good, clean, wholesome, Canadian fun was had by all. A few beers were had, but nothing excessive. Maybe I'm turning over a new leaf. All of this drunk-free fun is starting to freak me out.     Top 5 Songs From Canadian Television      urlLink "Run With Us" (from The Raccoons)  - Ah, the Raccoons, the high-water mark of Canadian animation. This cartoon was so Canadian it ate back bacon smothered in maple syrup for breakfast. I just have one question though: what the hell was Cyril Sneer supposed to be, anyways? Some kind of pink aardvark, or something?    urlLink "The Zit Remedy Song" (from Degrassi Junior High)  - "Everybody wants something...". Ah,  urlLink Pat Mastroianni , he's  sooo dreamy ! I never liked Wheels though.    urlLink The Littlest Hobo Theme  - Lassie ain't got nothing on The Littlest Hobo. The Littlest Hobo is like  urlLink MacGyver , and Lassie is like Dr. Grant Roberts from  urlLink Danger Bay . Nuff said. This song kicks ass.    urlLink "Having An Average Weekend" by Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet  - You probably know this song better as the opening theme to the great Canadian sketch comedy show  urlLink The Kids In The Hall . They also did the bits of music in between the sketches.    urlLink The Hockey Night in Canada theme  - Even though you may despise hockey, you can't deny that no other song in Canadian history (outside of the national anthem) has stirred the hearts of Canadians more than the theme to Hockey Night In Canada. Okay, maybe "Bye Bye Mon Cowboy", by  urlLink Mitsou . Many people call this the second national anthem, and they may not be that far off. This song triggers something in your brain that causes you to sit in front of a T.V. with a case of Blue and yell at referees. It's genetic.

      In honour of the upcoming  urlLink Athens Summer Games , here is my list of the worst (in my opinion) events.    Bottom 5 Summer Olympic Sports      urlLink Archery   This is almost the equivalent of watching people play darts on TV. This is a sport that seriously needs spicing up. For example, you could put the archers on horseback. Or, instead of a target, have a dude with an apple on his head. Or dress them all up in Robin Hood costumes. Whatever. As it stands now, archery is about one rung below  urlLink Skeet Shooting  on the excitement ladder.     urlLink Basketball   Don't get me wrong: I like basketball. It's one of the few sports I can actually play with some level of skill. I am just sick and tired of seeing the U.S. team steamroll over every nation they face, every friggin year! In pre-Olympic action this year, the U.S. lost to Italy. Here's to hoping this trend continues.     urlLink Rhythmic Gymnastics   This "sport" is retarded. Seriously. End of story.          urlLink Weightlifting   Look, if I wanted to watch roided up freaks of nature sweat and grunt for a few hours, I'd watch  urlLink Major League Baseball . At least baseball has fun organ music.       urlLink Wrestling   Yeah, yeah, "Olympic" or "Amateur" style wrestling is "real" wrestling, and professional wrestling is basically a testosterone-fueled soap opera, but until the Olympic committee allows piledrivers, folding chairs, shady managers to be used in wrestling, I'll stick with the fake kind, thank you very much.

Oh, and here's a little tip for anybody who plans to visit Margaree or any other part of northen Cape Breton: the flies there seem impervious to bug spray. Must be some weird genetic mutation.
