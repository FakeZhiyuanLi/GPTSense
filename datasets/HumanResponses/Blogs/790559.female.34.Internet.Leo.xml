      Interview pt. 2 is now over. Went well. The meeting lasted all of 25 min. Things look good. As I mentioned in my last post I slept on and off last night. It could be called a shallow sleep. I'm beginning to crash quickly. This is opposite of the high I was on about two hours ago when I met Rick for lunch (Rick snapped the pic below. A mullet like that is too good not to photograph). I was all grins and excitement. Still grinning. Just need a nap. I also got the .50cent tour of his law school.

      I am up early. Too early. I have a second interview for an admin job which also includes doing some print and web stuff. Couldn't sleep last night. Just the ordinary pre-interview jitters. Had a nap while watching Lost in Translation, but I chalk that up to being comfortable on the couch. I'm asking everyone I know to cross they're fingers and wish me well. So, around 10am cst send some good energy my way. I also need to find Rick a present for sending this lead my way. Something in the way of a DVD, m'dear? Something Barter Townish with a post apocalypse motif?   In the meantime check out how a donated tshirt travels the globe:   urlLink http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/tshirttravels/track.html

       I was wondering when I'd get to the blood and guts...   So, I got a lot done today. Laundry 80% done. Got my monthly expenses paid. Called Citibank and got my rates knocked down. :) The painting I have delayed in starting - started. I did some research for my interview tomorrow. Made some movement on getting a grant for my   urlLink MSCA  .  So, I decided to take the bike out for a spin. This is the bike that was given to me that Rick has taken the time to tune up for me. Now, I haven't been on a bike in prob 17 years and everything was fine. I got going w/ no hesitation on balance or steering. BRAKING however needs some work. I hit a wall. I hit a wall AND RECOVERED QUICKLY mind you. I also f*cked up my right hand. It's working well enough to type, obviously, but the skin on my knuckels is hamburger.   So, I hit the wall, noticed I was bleeding, but moved on and took a ride up and down my street a few times and then called it a day. Everything is fine until I actually take the time to look at the blood and cuts. That's when I got really lightheaded and sat down in my stairwell. Got upstairs to wash the cuts and got lightheaded again and laid down on the floor in the apartment. I'm guessing this thing I have with looking at blood (my own) cinches that I won't be working in an emergency room anytime soon. Anyway, I'm bandaged up and the delayed pain has started.

      "I'm happy to confirm the rumors.   urlLink Madonna will be going out on tour this spring and summer  ," her manager, Caresse Henry, said in a statement.   Must have tickets. Must have tickets. Must have tickets. This may be the last tour she's goes on and I've never actively sought out tickets, until now. I've put it off since I was 15, so I guess I should pony up the cash and try to get tickets to see her at least once. Then I can sit in the audience and scream like it's 1985 all over again.

      Cannot sleep...cannot sleep...cannot sleep. TRIED TO SLEEP, but can't. So, I am up moving my blog, cutting buttons on my new portfolio website, sending junk ims to Rick (should I call and wake you up so you can share my insomina? No. I'll save that for another night), downloading   urlLink Revolting Cocks  , thinking about government cheese (does it come with wine and crackers?).  I just started reading   urlLink The Seven Deadly Sins and The Pursuit of Happiness in America   by Dan Savage. You'll know him from his column Savage Love. The book is divided between the   urlLink 7 deadly sins  : greed, lust, sloth, gluttony, envy, pride, & anger. It's an entertaining and fast read. I picked this up today. I really need to get back to reading. It's relaxing. Not as relaxing as a bath or a massage, but mentally relaxing.  And besides, there's got to be more than Internet and tech books. Wait, there's comic books or graphic novels. I almost bought a few issues of   urlLink Transmetropolitan   today. I want to get the latest ones I don't have and I want them all at once. It's my favorite comic series, but I'll hold out a while longer.   I need to figure out how to post pics here too.   Going to try to sleep again @ 2.14am

      it's official I am changing web hosts. My blog could be voluntarily suspended until I set it up at my new web home. My new domain is beaidesign.com. You'll see a new look and feel and all that great stuff. A link to get to my blog will probably be near the bottom and be monochromaticly colored with the rest of the site. It'll be subtle like.

      Had a peaceful Easter. We didn't celebrate the holiday, but went to hit and run brunch (w/ delicious corn beef and a milk shake) with some of Rick's freinds who he hasen't seen in a while and then back to BOB for hang out time with Scott and Elizabeth.   Not having a whole lotta luck on our *project.* No takers as of yet. Hmmmmmm. Eventually...It can't be this hard.   Feeling up and down. Had a PMS episode last night. No so playful. :-( Medicating my monthly visitor with Advil and coca-cola and Hagen Daz frozen vanilla yogurt and raspberry sorbet. Along with a warm bath. I really need to get to bed by 10.00pm, but I am watching The 5th Element and admiring Milla's red - orange hair. I think I missed Gary Oldman already. Oh, wait it's starting again.

        I would be hesitant to say it's wonderful or awful, it's just strange ...   I just read   urlLink this article on the BBC news website   about Bob Dylan teaming up with Victoria's Secret for an TV advertisement. I think it's strange too. I was on the 145 bus today and when we reached Michigan Ave. I looked out the window and saw the Dylan poster inside the VS store. I was thinking to myself, " Do I really want to buy panties at a place where Bob Dylan's eyes follow me around the store? "

      Got a giddy call from Snotty today while I was undressing in the ladies locker room at my gym. The giddiness was purely immature and  high schoolish. He spotted our nemesis from our freshman year of college. This person is a cousin of a certain Playboy centerfold and currently a b-list actress on the a newer network. I dared him to yell at her and duck to hide. This would be a further step from posting none too nice postings on the network website for her show and character. Ah, well. We all need those 16 yr old moments occassionally.

       New boots! New boots! New boots!    The new fetish boots of my dreams arrived today. I'm trading them in for the pair I purchased in January. Those are a tad too tall and narrow for a short girl like myself. In my trial runs around my apt. I've been wobbley at best. The new pair get a * * * * rating. A tall heel, but a wider base. So, now when I wear'em out I won't tip over. My intention is to wear them while I pick up the apartment tonight. It will be very glam vaccuming and dish washing.

      I'm all alone at work. and drinking diet cream soda. Listening to a report on NPR. The report is on the career of a muslim clerics. The funny part, and there is one, is that the guy delivering the report has a speech impediemnt like Sylvester the Cat from Looney Toons.       Made some headway on getting my ass to the gym. I brought  weeks worth of gym clothes to work to keep here. That way there's no excuse about going. Didn't get to go today. The scheduling combined with my off-hours membership didn't click, so I stayed here. Tomorrow & Friday though.

      There are many places I'd rather be right now. 1.) Back in bed (which I just jumped up from) sleeping. 2.) In bed   urlLink spooning Rick   or vice versa. 3.) On my way to pick up that tax free 10 million dollars that was willed to me from a distant dead relative. I'd rather be doing any of those things rather than being up on the first day of a time change (spring forward, of course).   Wisdom tooth is acting up. I need to make an appointment with my dentist for some antibiotics until I have have this sucker out in surgery. I was at dinner with Scotty last night and told him I thought it was funny that my impacted wisdom tooth (dormant for months) suddenly flares up when I begin working at a place that deals with oral surgeons. Funny, my benefits won't kick in for 86 days. Dinner was good though (eel sushi and some teryaki beef). Had a good walk with Scotty from Sheridan to New Tokyo on Broadway south of Belmont. Good to catch up with him and not be rushed. Made plans to go see the Forbidden City exhibit at the Field Museum in a couple of weeks. Got some good music out of the deal. Need to burn that. I also need a cd player for the bus ride to work. Speaking of which I need to go throw myself in the shower.

      Today is Friday and that means two things. It's the beginning of a three day weekend and my move from Pine Grove is this close (----) to being over and that makes me say "YIPPIE!" And I get to spend some time with Rick not looking for apartments or moving from one apartment to the other.   Gotta make a decision over DSL or Cable MOdem. I'm not up for paying 7.00 an hour and La Screenz. I do enjoy the excuse to walk to Clark Street though. I love the new neighborhood. Change is good.   Went to Shedd's Aquarium today with my coworkers. It was Karen's berfday and she chose to see the fish. And she chose to eat fish for lunch (which was delicious). I was stuffed by the end of the appetizer. I TOO have now eaten my weight in shrimp.  Gotta BOOGIE!

      Today is the one year anniversary of my return to Chicago from the Bay Area in California. I left San Francisco International Airport at 7.30am. I arrived at O'Hare at 12.25pm to a humid sunny day with my backpack, two cats in carriers, and my laptop.  In the twelve months since I've been back in Chicago my life has improved tremendously. I'm a ton wiser from the experience of living w/ J and living in California. I have a wonderful, beautiful guy who I love and who loves me.  My new job which is "recession proof" and has excellent benefits and a great office. There's been a lot of work on my issue with anxiety. Still working on that, but I've begun to identify triggers and that has begun to demystify the whole thing. Sunday I will move in to a new apartment in a new neighborhood. And my oldest friend Scotty finally made the move to Chicago.  I'm very lucky, happy and have everything on the upswing. And I got a cat carrier at Brown Elephant for 4.00 bux today. ;-)  Now there's all this other stuff I want to improve upon. I need to work on my weight and get fit, because shedding 25 pounds wouldn't be so bad for me. There's a need to expand my social circle. Rick and I have talked some about this. We need to find more friends, mutual or otherwise. I want to learn to ride my bike with more confidence. I'd like to continue to freelance projects outside my day job. I'd like to read more and teach myself to be a better cook. And finally I really need to become organized. Lack of organization leads to chaos and I've had enough of that. The bad kind anyway. :-D

      Good day at work. We had another long painful web meeting. It's going to be slow, but soon the site will be wrestled away from a vendor.       Another good thing is that i just got introduced to the office   urlLink Wacom Pad  . I need to learn how to use one and now I finally can.

          Up late paying bills online. I'm impressed with the speed Bank 1 can pay a bill online over Wells Fargo's 3-5 day deliver. Bank 1 only requires a scant 2 days to make a delivery to your payee. 48 hrs is alright with me.   Got more packing done tonight for the Sunday move. I wanted to huddle under my comforter more than pack. The temperature dropped today. When I last checked it was @ 54 degrees. 80 had been the going temp and then there was the plunge.  Expecting to go to   urlLink Voodoo Cabaret   Thursday with   urlLink Rick  . Looks like thexy fun and I'm looking forward to dressing up a bit. Gotta wear   urlLink those boots   sometime. :-O  I had a very good day at work today. I did some research on getting into a   urlLink ColdFusion   Fast Track course. YIPPIE! And my boss and I went over the website with a fine tooth comb. There's a lot of work there, but I think it's a good project and the people I work with and for will be happy with the revised site.  I was happy to get to code today. It was very nice to be back in a production role again. That reminds me to   urlLink order upgrades  .  Now that I am getting settled at work I've been giving some thought to doing more web design work. I'd like to do *adult* sites as well as regular old mainstream sites. I know I can do   urlLink a better job   than a lot of what I see online. The fun in doing adult sites is being able to go wild in PhotoShop. Subtly is not valued in this niche. While I like suble, classy sites I also like being able to nuts with glows, bevels, drop shadow and scan lines.  And back to the move...I need rugs for my new place. And I need to go to sleep and a taco and a vice grip. :-D

      Just back from  urlLink  MamaCita's on Broadway  . I ate way too much. My plate was filled with skirt steak tacos, rice & beans, and a loverly  urlLink  orchata   on the side.   Had much chat with Scotty. The conversation was mostly about drapes from IKEA, our boyfriends, new shoes, the new *  urlLink END OF THE WORLD  * movie, my upcoming move to new apartment, and upscale *  urlLink DQ  * across the street.  Must start Scan Disc, must post titilating photos to blog, and must go to bed and rub belly for there is work tomorrow.

      It's been a while since I have posted anything here and I was suprised when I returned. Blogger has an entirely new interface. AH HA. Not sure if I like the new stuff or not.  Just got home from Boost and my visit with Scotty. Spent the evening chatting between customers ordering drinks and food. When not chatting I sorted thru the contents of the bin behind the counter. That explains this photo.      Need to sleep, but would also like to color my hair...Would also like to stay up until 3.00am doing absolutely nothing,but this whole job thing is in the way. ;-) It's interesting because if I didn't have a meeting tomorrow I could just call in and take the day off. My boss has encouraged me often in the 6 weeks I have worked there to take days off. It's an interesting place I have taken up with.  The apartment situation is working itself out which I am very glad about. It's a great large one bedroom apartment in a vintage building. Rick and I were both really pleased with the place. While I was @ Boost tonight I realize one month from now I'll be living in a spiffy new place and I sorta grinned to myself. I'm really looking forward to moving out of Lakeview and into a different neighborhood. Since I moved here in '96 I've only lived in Lakeview and I need a change of scenery.   I also heard from Michelle tonight. Good talk. I haven't seen as much of her as I'd like, but it's always familar when we do talk. She's got strep throat right as of now and she's scrambling at work. Hopefully, since it's summer and the son goes to grandmas we'll see more of her.

      I sat next to a guy on the train today who would not stop touching his face. He would dig in his ears then touch his nose and move to his eyes and forehead. At one point I looked over at him wondering what was so rub-worthy. When he sat down next to me I also noticed his odor. It was the same as when you walk into an IHOP or a Golden Apple. The heavy odor of cooking oil. This goes to show you don't remember the non-offensive folks you sit by. You remember wierdos.

      Let the bitching and moaning begin...  I was so tired last night I fell asleep in my clothes. Rick called around 9.30 as I stepped inside my building to say hi. He was on his way to pick up a friend for the MS-150. We hung up, I fed the cats, and I laid down and that's all I rememeber.  I had a semi stressful week. The Directory is finally in production. There's been a issue with extracting data from Access. My predecessor left no instructions on how she molded this thing last year, so I have been at a loss. I also have to get going on the Annual Newsletter and the presentation for San Fran. AND I owe Ying some work too. It's hard because the office has been very busy with a deadline for registration for an exam. So, the phone has been ringing constantly. The callers are both doctors and their assistants and they're stressed, confused, etc. because they let this registration go until the last minute and want anyone who picks up the phone to fix it - NOW. I actually had someone screaming at me.   The new hire in the office has suddenly decided not to speak to me. Wouldn't engage. Won't talk. WON'T SPEAK UNTIL SPOKEN TO! I told Rick I think I may have an idea what I am like when I become so quiet in a room full of people. I realized on the train this morning why this bothers me so much more than the obvious. It reminds me too much of my home growing up. I hate the silent treatment. So, it hit me in two ways.   And because of the tattoo I haven't been able to partake of my nightly bath. It's a huge stress reliever for me. All I have to do is soak for 20-30 min and I'm revived and relaxed. So, tonight when I get home I'm going to scrub the tub and soak. Tattoo be damned.   Now I sit on Saturday at my office Blogging and Quarking. I'm gonna head to a movie later. I may go to the Pride parade tomorrow. Haven't decided. The bike ride is a must.   MOOD: Settled down, relieved...headache gone. MUSIC: Ministry - Animosity

      For anyone who's into 3D movie AND porno. There's a treat @ the Music Box next weekend.   The Lollipop Girls in Hard Candy  Okay, here is the “plot”: the Dandy Candy Company is doomed to shut down and in desperation the boss turns to the factory’s chemists for help.  They produce a batch of aphrodisiac lollipops and soon Vera Tight and Percy Duckbutter and everybody else in town is sucking on the candy and anything else they can get their hands on, for example, John “Johnny Wadd” Holmes. Rated X and in 3D! (1975)

      I'm @ work early today. I have to finish a teeny project for Ying. I woke @ 6.00 and decided to hop out of bed shower and head to the office.  Had a good evening with Rick last night even though I was fading and giggly. The F&G start early evening lately because of the early wakeup. I got to meet  one of his MS 150 buddies last night. The other bike buddies didn't show. Hmmmm.  I'm going to get caught up this weekend on some projects at work. The annual directory is due to go to the printer next month and I need to boogie on that. May go see the Stepford Wives...playing it all by ear.

      Bill Clinton is on Oprah tomorrow. Someone on Air America Radio just called the vibe for his book release, *Harry Potter-like.* Oprah is on @ 11.00pm on channel 7 in Chicago for those of you who work and will miss the morning showing.  I remember being in Carbondale going to SIU and Mr. Clinton made many appearances there. One in particular was before he declared his intention of running for the Presidency. He gave a speech at a banquet where I was waiting tables. If I had known the future president was in the room I would have made my way over and given him my resume or at least gotten a picture.   * Since this isn't Live Journal and I can't add my mood or music:   MOOD:UPBEAT  MUSIC: Portishead from the Craft Soundtrack

           So, I've added to the tattoo collection. I love it and so does Rick and everyone else who has seen it. The whole process went very quickly. We arrived at 12.40 and by 1.00 the drawing was done and the outline was underway. Hannah was done with me by 1.45. I'm a tad sore this morning and that's no suprise.   I woke up this morning with my shirt stuck to my back. Apparently, I'm a human screen printer because the tattoo left an image on my shirt. I'm not going to wash it. I'm going to keep it and frame it. I don't think it's as gross as it may sound, well maybe it is. It's all ink and lymph. EWWWWW.        Rick had a great idea of incoporating purple and blue in the glow I want to add to the edges of the heart and flames. That will tie in the tattoos on my arms which have both those colors.  I believe my addiction to tattooing has come alive again.

      So, I have DSL on the way. I was told it will take 10-14 days until SBC delivers the goods. The line has to be "tested", of course. The phone line appears to be working. Now I need to dig up my tele-o-phone. I managed to get the cost with a phone line and DSL to $41.00. No cost to receive calls, but a .05 charge to make calls. That's ok. I'll take the lower rate. And it seems that SBC owes me money in the amount of $29.95 and so does ComCast. That's what I get for overpaying.  I'm still at work @ 6.11pm. I got a new PC today and I'm going through all the software and doing the online bills thing.  I'm about to leave though 'cause the cleaning lady is now on deck.    Gotta go home, perhaps visit Snotty, watch TV, and go to bed.

      There may be a visit to the Green Mill in my future. My colleague Karen and I are making plans to go. She's leaving in August and wants to go and that's cool with me. We spent the day making invitations for the organizations black tie event in San Francisco and that was cool too(I'm a tad tired, so the word "cool" will be used many times to describe things or thoughts in lieu of other more colorful words.)   After I leave this Internet Cafe I'm heading up to my spot at Boost. I haven't seen my cool friend Scotty since last week and it seems like a lot longer. I have to scan some stuff for him and his new job search. My other cool friend Ying has asked me to do some freelance work for her. This is good. I'm about to get a tattoo and don't want to dip into my monthly budget to do it. She's needing some animated banners for a cool Chinese website to advertise her cool online store.  My cool Rick is busy busy busy with Barbri. I expect him to hermitize himself very soon. It's good that graduation is over. He can focus on his cool work and be prepared for July's exam. :-D   Oh what else to write about...I'm thinking about a garlic turkey sandwich that's waiting for me at Boost. Today it was a Hostess cupcake. The urge to possess this cupcake was unbearable much like my yearning for the sandwich.

      I'm sitting here ... in SCreenz ... soaked. I managed to make it to Boost while the rain was just spitting. When I left, with a hijacked umbrella, the rain was pounding, so I ducked in here for some relief. I'm going to go home and run a hot bath to warm up and then make some orchata.  Since there's no work tomorrow I'll be hanging out with my sweetie, Rick. It will be like the old days before I had a job, but not the same because I have a job. :-|  I miss being able to do what I want during the day, but I don't miss not having a paycheck and not having more of a purpose than the occasional freelance project. Funny thing is two of my creative agencies called today offering me work. They haven't called in over 4 months. I wouldn't trade that for this at all. It was all too stressful and uncertain. And afterall who's going to trade that for free healthcare, trips to the Field Museum, free training, and good people to work with? Things are working out nicely. I do need to give some thought about what's next though.

      Back at Screenz...again. Must order ComCast high speed Internet service TOMORROW. I enjoyed being a bit cut off from the stimulus of email and "always on" Internet, but now that I am settled in my comfy pad I'm ready to hop back on the Information Super Highway.   Sunday is the big day for Rick. He's going to be officially graduated from law school. YEY RICK! You got a YEY RICK! last month when you finished exams, but I'll grant you another to two or three on account you're so special.   Gotta boogie. I'm down to my last .50 of Screenz time.

      Tad tired. I've been a busy badger this weekend. I can't decided to go home, stay here in the air conditioned confines of Screenz, go rent a movie, or what. I can report though that I have not had an episode of scary PMS this month, but my little cell phone just powered off from lack of juice.

      I must have been tired last night. I showered, Swiffered the apartment once again, and got into bed to read ('round 10.45) and that's all I rememeber. I woke up this morning at 6am and my reading lite was still on. I have to say passing out like that is preferable to my usual routine of laying and waiting to sleep. Must have been all the busy from the previous days and that day. Busy = good.  Tonight is the pub crawl with michelle and friends. I'm groomed and ready to go. I managed to pedicure myself without cutting off a toe. I'm callus free and everything.   Had a good talk with my Mom today. We were discussing what would be an ideal date for my parents to come up to visit. Soon I hope. I'd like to see them, introduce them to Rick, and show them my new place and neighborhood.

      Today is Friday and I am mucho happy. This weekend there's a lot going on. Rick will meet Michelle and Stacy. Michelle is leading   urlLink a pub crawl   stop by stop on the Red Line.   urlLink Stacy   flew in from LA to  schmooooooooze  at the  urlLink  Book Expo  .   We're also visiting the  urlLink  Printers Row Book Fair   and a visit to Cheryl's open house. When that's over I'm due to meet Scotty for a play. It's a take off on   urlLink What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?   and   urlLink acted entirely by drag queens  . WHEW!!!  Still unpacking at the apartment. The amount of packed stuff is less and less. Gotta go home today and do some laundry, Swiffer, and arrange what IS STILL PACKED in a organized way.

          So, I got a bit baked in the sun today. I was strolling around Graceland cemetery taking pictures and enjoying the peacefulness of the place. This is minus the security guard who stopped me to make sure I wasen't carrying a video camera. I didn't ask why no video was allowed. I just wanted him to move on and let me get to my walk around the grounds.   The headstones and mausoleums are very interesting. The earlier ones are more ornate and crafted. As they become more contemporary they loose a lot of individuality. There's a small pond in what feels like the center of the cemetary. Its a tad murky, but I believe there's fishies in there.   There's so much to see that I didn't really seek out anyone in particular (although Marshall Field, Louis Henri Sullivan, and more are buried there), but I believe I covered all the curves of the path around the grounds.

      Just spoke to my Aunt Frannie. I prob haven't spoken to her in 3+ years. She refreshed me on the fact that she's from Chicago and at one point attended the Art Institute. I knew there was a reason when I was a kid she was my favorite Aunt. She was/is a opinionated liberal. :-D I'm hoping we get to see each other sometime this year.

      I am fully dressed and somewhat alert and it's only 1.00 in the afternoon. :) I believe I slept too much and woke feeling flat and groggy. That's what 12hrs of sleep do to you. Rick called around 12.00 and when we hung up I went back to bed for half an hour. At that point I didn't know whether to sleep or to get up. I haven't done that in a while. On one hand it's a pain because there's stuff to do and on the other it's nice to lay around and just doze and listen to the radio.  I've gotta boogie on getting some stuff for the house, coffee, laundry. We're meeting Ying and Keving for dinner tonight. I'm hungry. I smell meat on a grill coming through my window. MMMMMMM.

      I say we string up the DBA or at least fire her and get a replacement. The DBA where I work just threw 30 hrs of work on a project down the toilet because she didn't set the a query to extract dates for the year 2004. This was after she gave me the OK to use them. Whoops. It's the details dahling. Details that make the difference.   So, I'll need one nice deadline extention. One new DBA. And a big scoop of *I'm not suprised this has happned considering who it is who did it!*  Oh on the upside the office is getting finally getting individual voice mailboxes. No more message taking. WHOO HOO! I'm thankful for small gifts.

      'Twas a busy, busy, busy 4th of July weekend. Rick and I were invited to get-together at Beth's in Rogers Park. She's got a great place right on the water of Lake Michigan. Like Beth said, ' I didn't know normal people could live on Lake Michigan.' The apartment has an absolutely awesome view. The place needs screen doors though. The bugs swarm inside at night. I was crawly when I left began to scratch everywhere from that sight.   Saturday Rick and I traveled to the wilds of Volo on Saturday. The reason was the   urlLink Volo Auto Museum   and the appearance of George Barris. He's the gentleman responsible for cars from The Munsters, The Monkees, The Blue Brothers, XxX, The Fast and The Furious and on and on and on...I got hit on once again by a man over 80 in front of Rick. This is the 3rd time...so far. And I was semi felt up by a woman who spyed my tattoos. She didn't even ask to see them. She lifted my sleeve and began rubbing my right arm. She asked me who did them and I told her. She asked if the artist worked at Jade Dragon Tattoo. I'm not sure which is more insulting. The feeling up or thinking my tattoos were the result of a visit to Jade.                      After the trek to Volo we we're invited to a rooftop party and A and R's. Lot's of people and food and once dusk arrived there was plenty of fireworks in every direction. This had to have gone on for 1.5hrs. And the view of the city was amazing.   We slept late this morning. I think we got up at 11.00 and soon after headed to Carrie and Francos and their huge puppy Enzo. They always make a huge effort for their guests, so the food and hospitality was excellent. I got a little zoned out while there. I'm   urlLink Cramp Queen   today. Ah, yes.   urlLink Menses  . So, I'm relaxing by writing this summary of the weekend and downing some Advil. I'll take a long hot bath when I get back from my trip to Boost to see Snotty.
