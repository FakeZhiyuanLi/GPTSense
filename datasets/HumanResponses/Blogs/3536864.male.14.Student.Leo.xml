                                                                Stealthy Assignment 		                                         	It had been 6 hours since the briefing.  The previous night, a special ops meeting had taken place in an American outpost just outside of Warbah, Kuwait.  Attending, had been Joshua Bradley, a member of the American delta force.  Bradley had been called to rescue another member of the Special Forces that had been captured earlier in the week. Not only to rescue him, but to also reacquire his explosives and destroy the bridge that should have already been in rubble.  The POW, Jim Foley, along with another of his comrades, was sent to destroy a bridge, on the Iraqi, Kuwait border; 50 miles south of Umm Qasar.  However, guards spotted them and Foley was captured.  Thus Bradley’s call.  Taken to the outpost, he was briefed on the situation and put on the helicopter to the Kuwait Iraqi border.    	Sitting in the helicopter now, Bradley sweated.  Just thinking of the job he had to do overwhelmed him.  According to the intelligence compound, he was going to have to pass through the guards and checkpoints unnoticed.  If the alarm was raised, then things would become difficult.  In the cockpit, the pilot glanced back at him and noticed that he was studying his map.  Indeed he was, he wasn’t given a GPS this round.  They would take to long to connect to the satellite and, at worst, might be pin pointed giving away his position.  A bump jolted him from his studying.  He looked up and saw the drop point.  His rifle, a colt m-167A with an attached grenade launcher, sat ready in his hands. It was just before dawn, the sun was already beginning to rise, and the dew had already soaked into the ground.  “Ok! This is it!”  That was his cue.  The helicopter was 15 feet above the ground; it was time to go.   Bradley slid to the ground on rope.  He watched as the helicopter sailed away.  In his mind he could still hear his commanding officer, “Ok, just get in, get Foley, get the C4, blow the bridge, get out.  BUT! Remember! If the alarm is raised, you’re probably toast.  Stealth is everything.”   	 	It was quiet now, the helicopter was already on its way back to base, and he was alone.  He crunched his way through the underbrush and scoped the area.  He was in a canyon.  There were two sheer, smooth rock walls on either side.  A way down the path, there was a steady decline in the terrain. The path wiggled side to side in the same fashion of switchbacks.  A small building was at the landing.  Across from the building was a ditch the spread the length between either side of the canyon walls.  A bridge, large and strong, strong enough for a tank Bradley noted, was on the far left side of the ditch.  Carefully, he inched his way to the first low drop on by the top of the switchback.  On the landing were three trucks one crossing the bridge and the other two waiting in line.  Suddenly, the roaring sounds of a jet sounded. Frantically he looks around, fearing that it would give away his position.  Interestingly enough, it was an allied A-10 Warthog.  Squinting, he could make out something falling from the plane’s bomb bay.  The ordinance howled as they pounded the tow trucks on the landing. The third made it over the bridge.  On impact, a man ran out of the building.  He was armed.  Seeing this, Bradley scrunched down even lower.  As he steadied his rifle the sights were leveled.  The rifled sounded off as three shots burst through the crisp air.  As another soldier saw his fellow on the ground, he looked up and spotted the sweating Specialist.  As the enemy opened fire so did Bradley.  Having a better weapon and training far exceeding his opponent’s, the combatant fell quickly.  Upon seeing his opponent on the ground, acting rather un-life like, he stood up and made his way down the path.  However, another soldier came across the bridge.  Seeing Bradley, he took cover behind a sign near the bridge.  A sign doesn’t hold up very well against a grenade.  Neither does the man behind the sign.  Continuing down the path, he trotted towards the building on the landing.    Entering, he found a radio, medical supplies, and a refrigerator that had food in it, but was unplugged.  Not really finding another use for any item except the medical supplies, which he had already commandeered, he left.  After crossing the bridge, the path took two different routes.  One of which turned right and led up to a checkpoint. The other route went through another canyon and split into many different paths.  Having been warned to avoid detection, he decided upon the left route.  Walking cautiously down the path, he observed that the sun was fully raised.  Avoiding detection would be more difficult now than ever.  Ah, man! One wrong step and I’ll land myself in the pit with the rest of the MIAs.  Bradley tensed with every sound, watching cautiously around every corner.  He was in a small canyon, with rock on either side, smoothed by the blowing sand, and nothing but sand and dirt in between.

      It really is late. You can tell by the way I'm typing that i'm a bit tired. I've been staying up late for the last three days. But no more of that, time for a random quote... Aha! ZuluChim: hey-ness Pharsalus8948: is that like what a horse says while he's eating with a long face at a bar? ZuluChim: very much like that           That was a bit random. I need to post a story that I've written, but it is very long and I don't want to post it all at once. After I post this blog, i will post one portion of my story, then so on and so forth.

      I was taking a nap, but then, here it comes. The foreboding call through the house. I was almost asleep when it came. What's this? A sibling needs help with his scooter? Oh no! It's coming this way! Do the sleep act! Quickly I bury my face in the cushions of the couch. I need heellp. Please, hey, wake up! Hello? I try to filter out the calls for aid. Failing at that, I pull the cranky Lord-of-touch-me-and-you're-dead act, and lo and behold it worked. I settle back into my nap..Ah, it's been a good day. My friend came over, stayed up late working on a lost cause escapde  that had been destined to fail since we set out, then I had passed out on the couch. I woke up and took the role of couch potato, then talked to a few friends by way of keyboard, and then ate some food. As I contemplate all this I am rudely interrupted yet again by a more urgent call. My Wheel is coming off! So I grunt, get up, and come outside. AaUgH! The sun! I need my sunglasses. I come back inside, get my sunglasses, and it comes to pass that the bolt had broken. Therefore the wheel was coming out. In my great genius, I don't search for the same size bolt, but find a small bolt with and place large discs on either end. With help from a friend, I tighten the bolt and it works! I, am a skilled metal worker. Well, maybe not, but there is my episode for today. Tune in tomorrow...well, not tomorrow, just later. I'll put something else amazing here. Caio!

      Yahoo! My dad is home! From Dallas! Where he has to work! And soon we'll move down there...! Good and bad, but he has a job there, so that's mostly good. Right? of course right. So he came back today after the final performance of vbs (yay, yay...) and taking my great grandmother some food...that's better than the goo they try to give her. But, now for the meaning of the title...Since i am going into highschool and all that fun stuff, i'll be going a few places by myself and doing things for long periods of time away from parental supervision. So, naturally, i need a way to check in with my folks. (who says folks?) And so, my dad got me a cell phone. Yahoo! I can call anyone in my family for free! So if you want to talk to me, you can call me so you will pay for the time, and i won't! But i can't talk long because i have a limited amount of minutes. And if you want to talk more than a bit (for what reason i don't know) call after 9 pm cause then i get unlimited minutes...but that doesn't really matter because no one knows my phone number! and that's the way it's going to stay. Not because i don't want to talk to you, well maybe i don't. But maybe i do. So now I'll just leave you in suspence forever. My brother and mom and dad all got new cells, and there's can take pics, but mine is great for me. And I'm happy, I wasn't going to get one, but then he got this one. So there you go. Out for now, I'm wiped. No...as in exhausted.

      The movie Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock is one of the weirdest, most twisting mysteries I've ever seen.  It's kinda scary too. The people are a bit insane, you don't know what is going on, and it has Jimmy Stewart, He's on of the best. Great movie though. It's the kind of thing me and my friends would get together and watch at midnight. Then talk about until 4 in the morning. I'd be so tired after that.                  I let time run away last night, and i need to compensate for yesterday's lack of sleep. Tomorrow looks more promising for something cool to happen. Like a giant storm or something. That'd be awesome. Out for now.

      This week is crazy. I'm being a staff member for vacation Bible school at my new church. That goes from 9am-12:30. It's not to bad; the little kids are good, but when you get to fourth and fifth grade it's time to bring out the whip. I have mucho grande child herding skills under my belt, two little brothers the same age, and I helped with Sunday school for two years at my older church. There is a fine line between being overly nice, resulting in anarchy; and being horribly mean, which results in tyranny. Which isn't all to bad, but then they don't obey you until actually move towards them threateningly. Some people find a small niche in the middle of that line, and they can control people firmly, but be a popular person at the same time. For instance, if i said, "you need to sit here, ok?" and they do it without question. That's the niche every child herder looks for. I was offered to go to a game night tomorrow night, but I don't think i'd be able to participate in anything. I stayed up way to late last night. Then i only got 5 hours of sleep. urk. I was very tired. So I got home and passed out on the couch. Great experience. I didn't really pass out...it was a figure of speech. The grand finali is friday night at 6:30. At TBC's old building. Now Memorial Bible Church. Finally, the thing i won't enjoy the most week is raking my entire back yard. Oh joy. Dead grass litters it, so i go out to rake it all in. Still have to do it, but it's really hot right now. I'm doing it in heats..hehe, heats? Heats as in a race heat, a heat as in it's hot heat. Man, that heat must be getting to me. Oh well, time for the third heat. I'll come back and post some even more corny jokes later. Chaio!

      If you could type a cry of anguish, it'd be here. This isn't any regular mowing, this is thick grass that must be cut every other day and my mower doesn't have a bag. That makes for one nasty yard when you're done with it. And I can't mow it during the full day, because I'd roast. Heat index and all.  So I have to wait till afternoon or morning. But, then again, it does make you buff after awhile, mowing and raking and all that fun stuff. And a bit sore too. But that's ok.  Time for an excerpt:  Pharsalus8948: my hands are sore ZuluChim: from? Pharsalus8948: i just finished mowing\raking our front yard  ZuluChim: oh Pharsalus8948: that was as thick as cheese off of a spinner Pharsalus8948: .....that was an interesting metaphore ZuluChim: uh...yeah....I was thinking the same thing  I have huge callouses on my hands though.  Going to be tough to get splinters in them now. My hands are sore at the moment, however, so typing must wait. Out for now.

      I just ate dinner. A BLT..mmm, it wasn't warm or anything, but still. A BLT can hit the spot without you even knowing you want one. This must be a great food day. I had an icee from quik trip, and it never seemed to end. I had calzone for lunch from simple simon's. They don't have the greatest pizza, but they're calzone is the best that i've ever had. They baste it in some garlic butter\italian sauce. I had six pieces. I felt like i was about to explode.  But it tasted good, so it was all worth it. Now tonight I had a BLT. And it hit home. I didn't even know that I wanted one, but now I know.                  I'm going to help with Vaction Bible School with my new church tomorrow. Supposed to be helping the little guys sing along with the songs during the music part. I wasn't going to do it, I was a reserve of sorts. However, word of my incredible skills for herding children got out. So now I'm going to be helping with that from 9 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon. During this time, I will join and begin training on a swim team, mow the yard twice, and continue in my latin lessons. I have a very full week. Then I do it again (in a sense) next week. Except it's a camp for my age. Very full. I also might get a small, part time job detailing and cleaning out cars. Amazingly enough. I feel exhausted just talking about it. Maybe I'll go mow the yard if it has cooled down at all. It was\is so hot today. Heh, but then, I remember, that someone was burned much more than me. I'll come back and write something amazingly insightful later. Now, Onward to learning about better mechanical amusements, and business opportunities.

      My word, that was the most stupid, retarded, and absolutley random hilarious movie(because it was so bad) probably this year! The costume desginer was a real duck...that's right, a duck, because they had no taste. I don't think ducks have tongues that can taste like human tongues. He's supposed to be this guy that can go through amazing stuff. But he gets shot and schooled. Then he becomes the king of the greatest empire of the world just like that. Not a bad spot, but no plot....not even a turn..Just hopping from one place to another as randomly as  a frog burping in a pond. Oh yes, that random. Don't see it, the worst 5 dollars i ever spent. Actually, the worst cause i ever spent 5 dollars on; nothing wrong with the dollars.                                                      Time to sleep.

      Yet again, I run into technical difficulty. I cannot edit my profile. From my profile when I'm signed on at my computer, or from the Dashboard. And the dashboard is getting different links on it all the time while taking off others...kind of annoying. On a better not i got to wash the car and get somewhat of a tan. And eat hotdogs. So there you have it. Out for now.

      It was so nice to wake up and have my dad here.  He's working in Dallas at the moment, but he got to come home for the weekend. My brother went to Ft. Gibson and he didn't wear sun screen.  His stomach and chest is SO sunburned. That's what happens, as I know all to well.  My dad took my entire family out to eat lunch.  We went to cheddars, one of my favorite resturaunts. I had the Rajun Cajun Chicken. As always, it was premium. Then we had a fudge desert and i about lost it. But, with my amazing will power, I saved everybody the trouble.  Then we went to look at PDAs. That would stand for Personal Digital Assitant. Not Public display of affection. Which is really annoying. The pocket PCs were cool too. But we don't know which one is the right one yet. They're cool...and expensive...i need some money...not for one of those, just money in general...Anyway, after that we went to the at&t cell phone place to look at those. I'm going to get a cell phone soon because i'm going into highschool, and my dad can get a certain kind of cell phone(which is pretty cool) for free. But not until we have a dallas residency for a dallas number.  We went to Barnes and Nobles right after that. Dilbert comics ensued. They're hilarious. Some of them are over my head, but I get most of them. Being a comic writer would be interesting to have as a your major occupation. You'd have to be funny, have a good sense of humor everyone can relate to, and be a fairly good artist. Then you have to convince your local paper to accept another comic strip in the Sunday paper. A very important boost to a one's profession.  I went to see my Great grandmother after that at the land of doom rehab center. She's the best person there. She hurt her ankle pretty bad, so she has to get it back up to walking strength. That'll take awhile.  That place though...Ehuaheuh! Ugh, it's out to get you, the smell penetrates you and goes right through your chest until it aches. I want to get her out of their. Already I'm formulating an escape plan...that includes mile long systems of under ground tunnels....That'd take awhile to dig.  It's a long term escape plan. Just like a trip to Russia on foot. Time waits for no one, not even me while I'm blogging, so I gotta go!

      Yahoo! I went paintballing today.  I woke up early(well,8:30 someodd) and walked around trying to decide if i should do nothing, or if I should do nothing in a different style. I went to tim's house and got there at around 10:20.  We didn't actually leave until around 11:00.  ...only becase JASON didn't get his co2 before he came. ;-) We drove back down to the woods we were going to play at, then unloaded our stuff, suited up completly, and walked, guns in hand, in search of the other guys we were playing with that had already gone out there. We reached a small clearing where we saw one of the guys motion to us and tell us that they were in the middle of hunting a small child.  YES he was playing too. He was just hiding, and he did have a paintball gun with him to defend himself.  Real short kid. We couldn't find him, so he gave up. Kind of backwards. Then i was going to test fire my gun because i hadn't shot it today. But no, of course, it didn't work. Safety off, co2 full, paint in the hopper, no fire.  So now i'm serioulsy peeved and annoyed. Peeved because it won't work, and annoyed because i don't know what's wrong with it and i don't know how long or how much it will take to fix it. Now it is getting towards noon and it is very warm and verry humid. So we decide to take to the woods. We find a nice spot that's shaded, and has a small stream running through one part of it.  And a swing was in the middle of a clearing there. A nice place for paintball. It wasn't really fair, because I now had to use a winchester paintball gun, that wasn't excellent, and one of my partners had the same kind of gun. My other teamate had a tippmann 98 with a lapco bigshot, and a stock. It was very nice. I also let him use my electronic hopper which allowed him to shoot really fast. The first game i was shot in the elbow while crawling\kneeling over the top of a hill. They got the flag that time. The second time we started on the other side, and i shot more. Still, no range. So i try to get closer. I crawl up towards this tree, and i'm in the underbrush so no one can see me. I'm also flat on the ground so it's kind of hard to crawl with a paintball gun. I get to my tree, and it just so happened, that if i lean any space at all to my left, I'm in the line of fire of an enemy.  Same story for my right. I eventually got shot in the knee by the little kid. He had a pretty good gun though. My other teamate, tim, was trying to flank, but he got shot right between the eyes on his mask from a Tippmann A-5. With a very accurate barrel.  But it was cool crawling because i was getting shot at. The paint splat on my friend's mask was awesome. He took a picture of it. Then accidentally erased it. So we shot his mask again. Then we did some defending stuff. Me, the little guy, and Jason with the tippmann 98, went over the stream and on to the other side. The enemy's job was to eliminate or cross the river.  I was the first to go. Naturally.  I was moving up to take down this guy right across the stream, but NO RANGE!! I accidentally shot tim. Hehe, he was reffing and taking pictures. Thus my profile picture. So then, the A-5 guy shot me with his amazingly accurate gun.  So i was out and had nothing else to do, so i swang on the swing. (oh yes, i swang) and supplied paint to people that were running out.  Then we walked back through a very hot path. (i didn't even wear my camo jacket. it was to hot. So i just went with my white under shirt.) back to a very hot car and drove home to a nice cup of cold water. So there is the epic of my paint ball experience in the woods. (hopefully not the last one)

      Here I am writing once again. I baby sat my little brother, even though he's ten years old.  Babysitting is just a term. Regardless of whoever is getting watched.  Which can be annoying.  I'm paintballing tomorrow at a stand of trees and a small field. It should be fun as long as i don't run out of C02. It's going to be awesome! Get to test out my new paintball gun....and light up tim...hehe, oh yes, i'm coming for you. Unless we're on the same team in which case we'll have to co-operate. It's great that it doesn't get dark until nine o'clock.  You can go play something outside until it gets dark, then you can come inside, eat dinner, take a shower or whatever, and it's already time to go to sleep! Or you can be nocturnal and stay up till dawn and sleep all day.  I know a few people like that. Little one calls, time to go! Chaio!

      At first, I had attempted to write a poem, but I decided to leave that to people that are actually gifted.  I felt inspired yesterday when I saw the clouds rolling around, but today......I just don't have it.  But there are storms here.  Oh yes, storms a plenty. I have been driven to my storm shelter 4 times this year.  They call it Tornado Alley for a reason. As opposed to other places like "Missouri, land of discovery" or something like that.  I can discover something in montanna if I wanted to. But I don't, so haha. If you think that was a bit odd, please read the disclaimer in small print at the top of the page.  Now you're going to look at the top of the page and see what it says.  I actually don't know that for sure; just a guess.  And this has gone all over the place.  Back to storms.  I love storms. Some people don't. I love the rain, the smell of the storm before it strikes, the color of the sky after the clear, sounds echoing throughout the entire enduring cell.  Lightning with flashes so bright that you are blinded in the darkness that surounds you created by the presence of the clouds. Other people that don't like storm are a bit odd to me.  Great way of displaying God's creation.   It's pitch black outside.  But you know what they say, it's always darkest right before it goes pitch black.  So now, I'll have to leave the rest of this space empty.....just like outside.....except outside it's black and not empty, and here it's black and empty.  So decided which one you want to believe.  Chaio!

      I just got a day-timer\planner\ deal. It's kind of sad that I have to had a daytimer DURING the summer.  Oh well, I guess it's good practice being organized and "neat"  during the summer so I'll be ready for next school year. Neatness isn't one of my strong points......but it will be. I'll make it one of my strong points.  I will Triumph!(my el guapo is disorganization)  Well, it probably won't be that glorious, but I'll get it down. This html thing is still plauging me...But that too! I will triumph!  I need an army doing all this triumphing.  Maybe I'll go hire one.  Alright, I'm out to hire an army, I'll be back.

      I'm back from the land beyond.....the computer chair.  I went to see Hidalgo last night at the 50 cent movies.  For the 50 cent movies it was pretty packed. Hidalgo wasn't though, which is a good thing.  I liked it, the only part I didn't like was the shooting at wounded knee.  Killing people in war is one thing, but killing helpless people is a massacre. That is defenintly wrong.  Hidalgo was good, but the Last Samurai is better.  They're not really in the same genre, so I can't effectively compare them.  Out of the two I liked the Last Samurai better. Maybe it's because it is a war movie.  I always liked those..go figure.  One thing that seriously annoys me is that great lack of tactics and strategy from the Samurai at the last battle. If they had   just  used a slight bit of tactics, they could have inflicted alot more damage, and sustained alot less casualties.  If they had positioned archers on either side of that small road the soldiers had to come down, they could have inflicted ALOT more casualties.  If they had used those pitch package deals, they could have burned more men, and if they hadn't LINED UP TO BE SHOT BY THE HOWITZERS they wouldn't have been hurt so bad in the first place. Hello?! Let's line up for the howitzers shall we?  I know they needed to stage a retreat and all, but stick a smaller force in there. Anyways, that's how that goes with me.  Time to go pick up some much needed supplies. Chaio!

      I think Xanga might be better than blog.  But blog does force you to do the html yourself, as opposed to xanga which does it all for you.  So really here you get a learning experience. So i'm taking a poll to see which one you think is better.  Just put it in the comments section, xanga or blog? Which one do   you  think is the best? The whole talk show host voice doesn't do anything for me.

      I played volley ball today at our church picnic.  First time i've really played.  I was the underdog... really underdog..i had some good moves.  Then there are my other moves, that really stank.  Thus underdog.  I'll get it though.  Only lost three out of eight games. Wasn't to bad. I played for 3 hours! On that note, it wasn't bad at all. Today my family and I went to mazzio's to eat pizza (oh, who 'da thought?) and cake.  We had to get our own cake, but we were going to have to get a regular sized cake for $17. But a guy from our church (who was also getting a cake for his dad's birthday) found the same kind of cake, and we could get two for $14.  Nice deal.  So we got that,(ryan and I) and we got frappachinos with the leftover money :-) On to mazzio's we went!  There we watched tennis, and european football...and made fun of french and german people.  I also had a trick played on me which is to close for me to talk about right now (it cut me deep ;-) ) and i messed up someone's fun by making the language portugeuse...yah.. Anyways... I went to a different church with my family this morning, it was a good sermon, and the people are very nice.  The old people anyway, the youth, i think, are all mute.  Time, once again, is not on my side so i'll leave you with this....Zzzzzz

      I wake up, go into my bathroom to brush my teeth, right?  I get the tube and squeeze it, and out comes this big bubble.  My toothpaste is green (no, it's not shrek toothpaste, it's just to show you how well it cleans...i guess) so that added to it. I know that toothpaste is a cleaner and all that, but still. Anyways, time limits me, so I'll check in later.

      Here I am, watching over the little ones.  My dad gets home later tonight from Dallas, Woohoo! I should probably clean up the kitchen a bit. It could use some cleaning.. I could always use my power and enforce slave labor. The title TASKMASTER doesn't seem to bad. Well, time to go check on them. Away i go.

      Ok, this is mainly a test, so if I say something on here, it most likely has nothing to do with anything.  So that pretty much rules out any relativity. Once again this is a test.

       I've just returned from seeing King Arthur with my cousin and my brother.&nbsp; It was alright; I'll give it a 50 cent movie rating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some language,&nbsp; some scenes that you could go without,&nbsp; but the violence as one would expect in a movie like this wasn't to&nbsp;bad.&nbsp; This contradicts with my cousin's opinion, but then again, that's why it is called an oppinion.&nbsp; It rarley actually showed the expendable crewman getting stabbed or anything like that.&nbsp; Blood was occasional, and this one part where Arthur has to pop somebody's fingers back into socket looks painful.&nbsp; Kind of like the feeling you get when someone scratches their fingernails on a blackboard....yeah, like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Theatres don't come in the best ways possible in my city...we have two fairly good ones. The Cinemark, and the AMC. The AMC tends to be expensive though, and it's not on my side of town.&nbsp; The starworld, which is the one we used, is ok but i wouldn't give it an award for....something like...seat cushioning...or backlighting wonders....or stuff like that.&nbsp; Time keeps going while I type, and I need to get up early this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out for now...

      I have just returned from swim team practice. I feel like a pansy. Then again, the other people (6 other girls varying age, the youngest of which is around 12 and the oldest must be around 16) have been for a few years probably. Or at least many months. We swam for one hour straight. Sprinting. Ah, very fun; I could barely keep up in the first sprints. In the warm-up we swam an easy 5 minute freestyle..I did better in that. Heh, that's pretty sad saying that I did better in the warm-up. Immediatly following this, we did more sprints, sets of 50 yards. I did alright. I was in the first group to go, and the last to come back predictably enough. Suffice to say, this happened about everytime. I did in fact, eat every one elses bubbles. ;-) I have not yet perfected my flip-turn, so I was slow in turning, I haven't perfected any of my strokes, thus increasing my water resistance and decreasing my speed, and increasing my chances of getting tired faster. Anyone with any tips? I think I just need practice. This is only my fourth day to swim, so I'm doing alright. Now that I'm home, I need to mow in about an hour or two...the smell of freshly cut grass. In the meantime, however, I can eat and take a nap or something. Out for now.

      I hadn't been to there in ages, but some friends from out of town came and I also hadn't seen them in ages so they canceled each other out and we went there. I had the big chicken all you can eat thing, but i didn't have anything for breakfast so the rfried beans didn't taste all too apetizing. During the middle of the meal the electricity blinked and of course Genny's(friend from texas) little sister(obviously little sister of friend from texas...and she also lives in texas..go figure) decided to scream a bit along with some other friend's son who is only three. After we sort of ate the food, Genny's drink was taken away by the waitress so she could get a refill. However, we believe that the waitress either didn't like us because we insulted the food, or the syrup had drained down to the bottom of the drink. Either way, it tasted nasty. Following that episode we decided to  go and see if we could try our luck at the arcade.  However...we need money. One of us obtains a large bill (not to large) and puts it all into tokens. I being the only one with pockets large enough to hold 108 tokens was left with the majority of the bounty. I'm likin' this, a cargo pocket full of tokens i didn't even pay for, and ski ball and cruising the usa at my fingertips. Muhaha! I exercised my will power however, and shared the tokens that weren't even mine. We watch the little ones while at the same time ski-balling and racing. This is great. Ahh! now the storms. We had great storms with some nice thunder. The little ones have now scattered so Genny and I go on a racing spree. She testifies that she won most of the time, but I, being the male, flatly deny that claim. I had the coolest crashes anyway. And I beat her plenty of times. Anyways...We probably blew around 25 tokens on that alone. And we raced for probably half an hour. We did all the courses. And two different cars. The humvee and the jeep. Cause all the other cars are wimpy. My little brother accidentally chose manual, that was fun. I had to dodge and maneuver five car pile ups and big trees (even tho you could run over them anyway) with one hand while shifting. That's talent. Did some more ski ball, and then we had a very small number of tokens left. Genny and I raced once again and i won once and she won once. This one kid got boochoos of tickets in some gambling game. He must have gotten 250 tickets. With no tokens and with nothing else to do, we had to get creative. In this case, it had great potential. You see, My friend's little sister (see above) had a little toy frog that was perfect for shooting at people. So Genny and her cousin becky plotted to shoot me with it, but she couldn't figure out how to do it so there plans were shattered. So much for that....the Guatamalan assassin will need to devise something new. I also revealed the fact that one of my siblings is deathly afraid of rubber bands. All I had to do was act like i had a rubber band by holding two fingers by each other and he shrank into a corner. Amazing. Having nothing to do, and being creative as we are, we decided to go back to the tables to avoid doing something that the staff wouldn't approve of, and because there were no chairs. Once we got there though, our parents stood up and left, and we went with them. The rain was still raining, so Genny went to get her car...danger..i could feel it begin to reek in the air the moment she put her foot on the gas pedal. I jumped onto the median on the way to my car, but i still didn't fell safe. She has a 2 ton weapon, and a curb won't do me much good. She actually drove very well considering that she almost couldn't see over the steering wheel...heh, sorry, i couldn't resist. Then they drove away and we drove away...and then i made political campaign signs for the next two and a half hours. Sitting...in the same room...making signs. Ah well, at least I had a better note for the day, and that would be my visit to Casa Bonita. Ciao

             I've joined the swim team. Very cool. I went to get evaluated and all that fun stuff on Tuesday; I got my ID card for the ymca (the team I'm at for the moment, might join bixby) and i got really tired. I was on my way to a friend's house to go hang out, but then I realized that we had to be at the Y in 20 minutes. That kind of stank, but it turned out okay. When I first got there, I had to swim freestyle for 5 minutes. I'm sure that's not hard for people that swim, but I haven't done any swimming like that in a year or two. I finish up and I'm pretty tired. Now they want me to just flutter kick down and back. I get critiqued and try again, and I have it down pretty good. Now for the freestlye drills. I need to work on my 1)Alternate breathing 2) Arm strokes 3) Not getting tired. After that I did the breaststroke, and the coach said I was really good at that. It's my favorite stroke because you're underwater for the majority of the stroke. The coach said that my leg\kicking was great, but my arms stank. I was given yet again more pointers (i needed them) and was sent down to the other end of the pool. My pointers, and back I went again. She said that it was almost perfect right then, but I know that I still need to work on it alot...not to mention endurance. I did the backstroke and some other drills, and some push off and and starting techniques. After all this, I got out, and got dressed and all, though I'm still wet and my shirt is soaked from the bottom to about 5 inches above that. In order to get my card I need to get my picture taken. Nice. I get my picture taken and lucky for me it wasn't zoomed to much. Chlorine takes it out of ya. Time to go and take a shower. I'm all chlorined out. Ciao!

      I think I've figured out how to leave out the title. This isn't about any specific item, so I can't really give it a title. This portion of this particular blog should be called "Attic adeu" or some other cheesy alliteration like that. See, I don't get to sleep until twelve this morning (woah, now it's tomrrow again, must be a growing trend or something) and then I was woken up by a sweet storm. However a lamp was on and I had to turn that off. So I have this totally sweet storm with thunder and lightning and all that other stuff, and I'm to tired to watch it. Then i'm woken up yet again. I'm thinking that it has to be pretty early because my mind is still asleep and my body is kind of getting up, but not really moving, then laying back down. Come to find out it is 8 o'clock. Ugh. I creak out of bed, and I am hustled around the house by little siblings telling me that I am wanted outside. So I go outside and lo and behold the grass is wet. That's ok though, I don't really mind. I find out we are going to mount a satellite dish on the side of our house. Joy. We mount the sattelite on the side of our house with little difficulty, but now we must feed it through the attic into the house. So who gets to go up into the actual bowels of the house and fiberglass? Me. That's ok though, i wanted to go. Here is the cool part, we have this ball that is attatched to the end of a rope kind of thing, and we tied that to another rope, and then i went up into the attic and threw it down to another part of the attic where the cable was. This was my idea by the way...very genius. kind of. Now it is getting pretty hot. It got up to around 95 degrees. So now I plug in the cable to the jack and i come down. Totally awesome view, you can see the skeleton of the house. However, as I said, it is really hot right now. Quickly following after that, I come down, and it does not work. So, we unplug the cable and string down through the house. Now it works because it is the actual cable itself coming straight from the satellite to the reciever. That's nice and all, but we want it to work coming throug the cable jack up in the attic. So again, I go up into the attic and plug in the cable. Now, again it does not work. So again we pull it down through the house. And that's the way we've had to leave it. So perhaps if you know why this might be happening, just leave a comment...or follow the popular trend right now and know what could fix it and don't say anything. Out for now. Ciao

      I've officially seen all the spider man movies more than two times each. Yes, they're that good. If you haven't seen it yet it is defenintly worth the 5 dollars. (If you're a student) I would like to put down some of the funny lines, but I think that would spoil the movie. All the times I've seen it have been after 9:00....pm. So that means I keep getting home rather late. That's ok however, because I've developed a tendency to sleep in whenever a situation like that occurs. So, I'm alright. Not that it is a special tendency, but it helps. Now I'm hungry. So if you have any spare time and money send me a giant calzone or something like that....and some pie too. That'd be really nice. Probably going to bike in the rain. Interesting feeling that, but you should try it.

      At the moment, I have a dog in my lap. Go figure. Anyways, Not much going on here except school starts in a few days....joy! No, seriously. ;-) At the moment I am also listening to George Winston Jam out on the piano.  Linus and Lucy all the way. He is also crazy good....except on a piano. In case any of you kind hearted people out there want to randomly give me some money, I would rather have the Korg SP-500. Or even better the Triton Extreme. Also Korg. So, anytime now. I'm out, I need to read a certain other blog, then I need to do assorted variety packet special deals....of sorts. C'ya

      Woah, he is crazy good on a guitar. Anyway you want it, he can play it better than anyone else.  I don't fully attribute that to him, because I know God has really blessed him with that talent.  Totally amazing, You can do anything with Christ who strengthens you.  That really shows because he only has 9 fingers. And he jams like nobody's business.

      I just played a really cool song on the piano. No music, no chords on purpose, just let my fingers down and off the went. It was a slow sort jazz blues song.  Most of the chords had either a flat or sharp on the 3 and 5 fingers, and a natural on the 1. Kinda cool.  I eventually harnessed it and put it in C and ended both hands on a C Major.  It was cool because i played it and it sound kind of cool, but it was also a bit mushed together and from a technical standpoint it wasn't very good.  Someone who is better than me would probably have smiled and said, "Yeah, that's good." and pat me on the shoulder all the while having this condescending 'I know something you don't know' smile and think the same thing.  Ah well, it will come with technic and practice.  Until next entry                                                   Shonan

      It takes a bit to earn that.  I still have a bit of my bit to go...a big bit.  Practice and time.  And theory unfortunatnley. Theory on chords. I just need to learn to jam.  I can read music, i have a good ear for piano, but i can't seem to jam at all. It's bugging me on a metaphorical level.  It will come. I'll make it come.  Hehe, i'll make it come in  bit. In the meantime I'll be practicing Maple Leaf Rag.  Very cool song; right now i'm on the second page. Woohoo!  The first page needs some dynamics, and a bit more fluidity, but besides that it's totally done.  All I need on the fourth page is the notes, speed, rythym, and dynamics. So i'm pretty much all set there.  If I could get one a day....Wouldn't that be nice.  And if I could learn to jam in one key each week! Man, i'd be a serious prodigy. That's not what I am so dilligence comes into play.                My older brother was greatly privileged last night because he heard  Don Ryan  in concert with a jazz band. Plus played Linus and Lucy.  With the extremely crazy hard and cool jazz part.  Ack.  I'm next. If I could pick three people to see in concert, it wouldn't be some rock band or anything, it'd have to be people with major skill.  So Phil Keaggy, Don Ryan...and....either an edited version of Dave Matthews. (No, i do not listen to any of his songs that i've heard have language in it.)  Or maybe James Taylor.  I wouldn't want to hear Harry Connick junior, cause i saw him performing once on some tv channel; banging some chords out that didn't really sound good and acting like it was pretty much all about him.  Poser.  If you disagree, comment on my blog so i can delete it.  Time to go practice some more or listen to Maple Leaf Rag so I can practice it. Ciao

      So it begins.  Yesterday I had to organize my desk and get all my notebooks labeled.  I get to work at home, see? But don't think it's easy and I get to slack off all day cause i don't....all you anti homeschool people. Plus we have harder stuff at an earlier age. The US really needs to work on their school systems. Ah well, maybe later.  Today I get to label more notebooks.  Joyousness! Plus tomorrow I get to get up at 8:30 in preperation for getting up at 7:00. Not that early, but that doesn't really matter right now.  On the upside of all this, I don't fully start school until the 30th.  So I'll have plenty of time to practice Maple Leaf Rag. Now it's time for something a bit more exciting than sitting here and typing. Ciao

      Hey, it's been a bit. Wow, King Arthur was the last entry. Ok time to update some.  A few things have happened in that time space.  One of the most important is that I've obtained  the  actual sheet music for  the  actual Maple Leaf Rag. Interesting name: yes.  Awesome skill requirement and totally rewarding song: yes. So it evens itself out.  In fact, i'm listening to a clip of that song right now.  Absolutley amazing.  Also in that time space was the action packed Friday. I had a birthday party I had to go to, and immideatly after that some of my friends had a gig at a coffee shop. The well known Kaffe Bona.  I took a ride with a friend (Some call him.....tim?) and not only was he conveniently going to the birthday party right after practicing for the gig at my house, but he was also playing at the gig after the birthday party, so getting a ride wasn't an obstacle.  After the birthday party which conveniently provided dinner, i didn't even plan to eat anything and I still got food, we played poker and did the whole present thing....except i forgot mine...but that will change soon. I played some piano and was out the door to walmart.  Tim's fingers were pretty much eaten away the by the guitar strings, so we needed superglue so his fingers wouldn't hurt and he could solo.  Off to walmart, off to....which aisle would superglue be in? Tim thought that the aisle with medical supplies would work, cause if you get a cut you need something that will stay on it right? I told him that the rest of the civilized world used band-aids...except for his neighbor , then told him that we needed to go through teacher supplies.  So we did, and in the middle of his sentence about why woud someone put superglue in the teacher supplies there it was. Score.  Got the glue now on to the cash register! We found an empty express lane, but the guy had to go find a ten dollar bill for change, so we ended up waiting for around three minutes.  Once we were in the car, we had to maneuvre through the parking lot full of medians. Kaffe Bona was packed. It's a relatively small place to begin with, but with this many people (they raked in quite the audience...and money for Kaffe Bona coffee) it was rather stuffy. First, there was a group playing ahead of us.  They were going to play for about 15 minutes, then the  real  show would begin.  It was horrid.  I mean, really horrid. I had to tell my friends that were there to dismiss the first group because Ryan's group was nothing like this.  Just to give you an idea of how deranged they were, first you couldn't hear the girl on vocals, second the guitarist was repetitive, third the third guy had a 20 key keyboard he kept trying to make weird sounds off of, and was throwing light bulbs into a box so they would break and make noise. He did this repeatedly with three lightbulbs, a cell phone, then finally dropped the entire box of lightbulbs.  However this missed the box and hit the floor because he wasn't looking where he was dropping, but was smiling at the crowd.  Not only that, be he had the oddest "hat." It looked like an oversized, confused pop corn kernel gone wrong.  And it was brown.  A second song they played was even worse...if that's possible.  The guitarist was playing, and the third guy was was running a power drill next to the pick-up just to make noise. Really hideous.  Then Something else started playing....yeah, that's the name of Ryan's band.  So when you're in the car and someone says ," Dude, put something else on."  You'll know what to do.  Yeah, i thought it was cheesy too, i had the great name of Acoustic Cappuchino, but no.  Anyway, throught that time i listened, talked, and surfed the web. Cause it's an internet cafe as well.  Some people from the birthday came too, because we invited them and Tim and I know just about all of them...which is why we were there... All in all, it was a good jam. We packed up, got some free stuff since I was with the band, and went home.             So that is the account of that Friday...i'll come back and post a bit later with the rest.
