      I'm sitting here, doing something really boring, but inevitable. After two years of neglect, I have a whole bunch of CDs that needs indexing. The problem is not the lack of great indexing tools, there are a bunch of those, the problem is that it's time consuming. Just sitting here, switching CDs every 15 seconds for some 400 plus times adds up to a lot of time (about 100 minutes). That's what you get for putting things of. The really sad thing is, it doesn't matter that I swear to index every new CD the moment it's done, I know I won't. Maybe I will keep it up for a few weeks, but then I'll be back to my old routine. The CDs will stock up, and then I'll be sitting here again in two years with another pile of CDs to index.

      I got an e-mail from  urlLink Expedia  today about their spring and summer sales, so I decided to check if the price for the trip to Las Vegas I'm planning had changed. Clicking my way through to the dates and hotels that we are considering, I discovered that the price had changed. It's now back to the old price, which means another $30 per person. It's still a long time left before we're planning to go though, so prices may just take a turn for the cheaper again. Hopefully. If not, too bad, but it's still a good deal. Worst case scenario, prices go up another $30, or $60, per person. Time will tell.

      My life pretty much goes in phases. Right now, I'm in a customization phase. This means that everything that is related to customizing Windows, browsers, mediaplayers or any other type of application, is of interest. Every time I enter the customization phase, it's more fun. Since a few months pass between them, there are always more options, better tools, and a broader selection of themes and such. This time around, it's  urlLink Samurize ,  urlLink StyleXP ,  urlLink IconPackager , and  urlLink MyIE2  that's getting my attention. With those applications, Windows won't even recognize itself, much less will you or any other people who regularly use the same computer as you. Of course, the customization process wouldn't be complete without a few visits to  urlLink deviantART , and there extensive selection of themes, icons, and wallpapers.  Enough with the writing! It's time to hunt for an even better set of icons, find another use for Samurize, and see if there's any tool I've missed in my quest to give Windows a major makeover. Got any suggestions of good themes, icons or tools? Send me an e-mail at  urlLink blogger@ow.nu .

      I added a countdown to my desktop this morning. It counts down to when the plane heading for USA, and my vacation, takes off. Seems like a very long time at the moment, but I'm hoping it'll be more inspiring when I see the days ticking away. Either that, or I'll go crazy and remove it. We will see.  There's usually something to count down to, to look forward to. If it's not Christmas, or your birthday, it's vacation, someone else's birthday, or maybe just a big event. People usually counting down to things, and I'm not really one of them, have a lot of stuff to count down to this year, especially the sports fans. I don't know if that is stressing them out, or if it makes life little easier. For me, sometimes, the only thing that keeps me going is knowing I have just 1 month, 24 days, 4 hours, and 5 minutes left until take-off.

      As a lot of other people, I'm kinda obsessed with spending money. I couldn't contain myself anymore and just ordered a  urlLink Smartcaze . I've been wanting one all day, such agony! I actually thought it was kinda affordable. Bought the Flipover model which was $26.50.  Any way I can spend money makes me happy. It's not as fun when the credit card bill arrives, but that's another problem. Now my beloved credit cards will have a new, and improved home as well. I bet they are just as happy as I!  Time for some  urlLink stumbling .

      I'm currently planning a trip to  urlLink Las Vegas  this summer with my wife and brother-in-law, and guess if I was surprised when I noticed that the price for the  trip had gone down $34 per person since last night! That's a huge difference for a three day trip. We still haven't really decided on the hotel though. At the moment it looks like it'll be  urlLink The Mirage  or  urlLink TI , but it could just as well be  urlLink MGM Grand  or  urlLink The Flamingo . If the price continues to drop at this rate, which is highly unlikely, but not impossible, we might even stay at one of the more  urlLink expensive hotels .  Any ideas, suggestions or warnings are more than welcome! Feel free to send me a mail at  urlLink blogger@ow.nu .

      Ok, so I hear you're supposed to have a Blog. And now I do. How does this change my life? Will I become addicted to keeping it up-to-date, or will I forget about it in a week? Time will tell, I suppose. I also have to think about what to do with it. Should I just write random ramblings, or is there some sort of concept that appeals to me? Head hurting. I need a break.

      Just as I thought my last customization phase was over, it pulled me right back in! Maybe I was a fool for thinking I had checked all the new cool tools out, maybe there are just more posibillities than I could imagine, or maybe, just maybe, things are progressing in such a tempo that it's impossible to keep up if you don't spend a lot of time on it. Apart from the new tools to customize Windows, I will tell you which in a moment, I was very happy to learn about  urlLink PearPC , I just have to check that out.  Back to customizing. The most interesting new little application I found was  urlLink neXplorer . A MacOSX Finder clone for Windows. Not that I'm really fond of Finder, but it's just fun to find things that makes it possible to experience Windows in new ways. Considering eye candy alone, Windows is way behind, no question about it. The tools available at least closes the gap, and there are new and improved tools popping up all over right now. For someone who loves to try new toys, these are interesting times.

      Finally booked the trip to Las Vegas! I'm really excited. We've been talking about going for like two years, and now it's really happening. After a lot of looking at the hotels, pools, casinos, locations, and what not, we decided to go for  urlLink The Mirage . One of the biggest reasons we decided on that was the whole atmosphere. We like foilage and tropical islands, so it sounded like an interesting hotel / casino.  We feel we got a pretty decent price too, $370 per person including flight and three nights. There was a whole lot of deliberation before we decided to book flight and hotel separate. It all came down to options and flight times in the end, and now we're hoping we'll get the most bang for our buck. Now I just need to start saving up so that I can afford to lose it all gambling.

      So I haven't updated my blog in a while. Why is that, you wonder? Well, I've just been too busy. Being too busy to take a few minutes of your time to write a few lines of text is not fun at all. Okay, I confess, it's partly my own fault. The main reason I've been this busy is that I accepted this new producing job I was offered. The thing is, though, as a start-up production company, you need to pretty much take any jobs that are offered. And don't get me wrong, producing is what I really want to do. It really gets me going. Talking to 20-30 possible sponsors just to get 3 hooked is exilarating. You kinda forget all the negative responses. It doesn't matter that it's only for a very low-bugdet 15 minute short, it's still an awesome experience.  Hopefully, I'll have a little bit more time after this weekend, when shooting has wrapped. I will also try to write a few lines later this week, but that may not happen.

      As I stated earlier, my life goes in phases. The last phase was to customize Windows and the programs I use. That has ended, and now I'm obssesed with organizing and experiencing my digital music archive in new ways. The tools that has come to my attention this time is  urlLink SlimServer ,  urlLink MoodLogic , and various  urlLink plugins  for  urlLink WinAmp 5 .  It all started with an urge to try the new  urlLink iTunes , and the it all just kinda rolled on. I'm not really sure if I like iTunes or not. I haven't had enough time to try the new version, but the previous version had a major flaw in it's shuffle algorithm, which lead to the same few songs being played over and over.  urlLink MoodLogic  seems kinda promising, but at $29.95, I have to consider it.

      Found a site today that makes a few good points. The address is  urlLink http://www.internetisshit.org , and although I pretty much fall in the category of people the site criticize, I understand the purpose of it and also agree on some of the points. For one, I totally agree with the site regarding people that consider everything they find online to be the absolute truth. This is definetly not the case, and some are using that to their advantage. I suggest you read through the site, it's only a few short lines on eleven pages. Maybe you'll realize something important. Google isn't God and Internet doesn't hold the answer to everything.
