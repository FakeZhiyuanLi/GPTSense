      Yeah so me and Mike are no more--- And ya know, at the moment I’m kinda okay with it…hes an ass and I cant believe I actually thought that he was serious about our relationship- or even about me. Well he “got what he wanted and doesn’t care if he ever talks to be again”…WHATEVER man… I’m done Talking about, Thinking about, And liking MIKE……(erg I hate him!) Well tonight is graduation and Eric is supposed to have a little shin-dig and Car said that Nate should go and I said OMG hell yeah b/c he’s a hottie :P AND THEN Tom is all like “you guys should hook up, I was thinking about it yesterday and you guys should just do it” and I’m like umm….duh! And then lunch was over and Car didn’t get a chance to talk to him and I was like oh crap that sucks, and then I saw both Tom and Car talking to Nate in the lobby right after---I like ran out the door so fast so she wouldn’t call me over…I’m suck a pussy but damn he’s so fine  I CANT WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT HE SAID!!! ---AND---] He actually talked to me today, like pulled me aside and talked to me…yeah it was about getting more pills but still HE talked to ME :) AHHHHH!!!

      yes its true...my whole day was a blur yesterday and then finally school was over and me and Carly went to Manchester to do build-a-bear (so fun!) and then we thought it would be a nice thing to go to Dover to ya know see the boys and I had to do the whole getting yelled at by Shane thing so ya know we went... !!! BIG MISTAKE !!! Mike, Shane, Kait, and Chris were there waiting to leave and Mike was being in one of his show-off and be an ass moods that I fucking hate, AND THEN just when we thought it was safe Nick showed up (((TOTALLY UNEXPECTED))) expecially since I didnt know he would have enough balls to just be there with us after the whole "thing"...(yes lets call it a thing)...Soooo of course Mike didnt want to go out and smoke me a butt with just me anymore, he wanted me to go out there WITH NICK, common now! DUH! Like I'm really gunna do that...after him being so mean to me the whole time, he wanted me to be in the same room with the boy that he had been icnoring me for to comfort him b/c GOD-FUCKING-FORBID that he could lie in the grave he had doug for himself ALONE. So yeah THEN Mike left with Nick and Chris after he asked me if i wanted to go and i didnt answer, but im sure even if i would have said that we could have, he would have made up some lame excuse why i souldnt go so he can fuck Nick in the ass...God i hated that...I hate yesterday...I hate Nick...(eventhough I never really did...i just desided to- just now) AND OF FUCKING COURSE Mike had to talk about our...ummm sexual experinces- i guess i'll call em...yeah in frunt of everyone, like it doesnt always bother me like when we all high-fived in the bathroom after we all had sex (not all 4 of us together) haha...but its different when he talks about it when were all NOT drinking and infrunt of Kait- its not like i dont want her to know its just that i feel kinda aquard ya know? like shes an older girl and its intimading enough as it is....ERG i hate him...and he didnt call me lastnight eather...what the fuck what a bad day, and yesterday, i must go home and smoke a joint with my best friend and fix my computer....And Nate...yeah is so hot! I want him...i really really really do... we gave him a ride home yesterday, hes a good guy...so nice-gave me the best butt ive ever had...camel menthol, but called something defferent though...Ive wanted him since fucking freshmen year...shit some day we will do much more than make out at a 311 concert :P  well that made me feel a little better...untill next time

      The school year is almost over and its so weird to think about. The seniors and leaving and in a few weeks we will be taking over their role as the the rulers of the school...I like that part :P  We have only 8 more days left and three are finals, I love having those b/c we can leave so early...Its awesome. I'm in web page design again and am supposed to be working on my final project but I just cant...You can call it ADD or just laziness but im not doing it...I just don't want to be around when Mr.Silverstien finds out, hes going to be really disappointed and thats sad b/c hes like one of the only teachers I like, almost my favorite :( OH well... I smoked for the 1st time in a long time lastnight...well and this morning on the way to school but lastnight it kicked my ass...everyone at home knew and were giving me a hard time while I laughed hysterically while they judged, good thing I don't care huh??...This day has been such a big blur, high till lunch then right after taking some vikiden in team meetings (thanks Steven) (and David) the wonder of free drugs...its awwwesome. I didn't talk to mike lastnight and I am finally feeling a little guilty for what I said to Nick, just b/c of all the trouble it has caused with Mike and Shane and Car I think so...I know it was wrong and all, and I shouldn't have done it and everything but I did and there isn't anything I can do to fix it now, especially now that Nick  hates  me whatever man...Good think I don't care...But I would still like to fix things with shame just so that it doesn't fuck things up between us, like his opinion of me, I think it was good up to that point. I think he thinks of me as a little girl, a cute one and all, but still he takes the role of more mature older mentor or something, sometimes I wish he could just relax and let me be 17...car thinks so too, just mainly about the drinking and driving thing, but whatever, its like Car said: we have soo much more time to party and do whatever we want, we just have to make the best of being 17 now.

      Hi whoever is reading this...I saw this thing on Knock First so I though that I would try it out :) I'm in WebPage Design right now and supposed to be working on my final project but so far I've written some emails to Car and Ed and played online Scrabble for like an hour, its been a fun double. You would think Im a senior with my "schools almost over" attitude goin on right now...This shit is pretty cool, it can be a way for me to keep the days and night straight that just seem to blend together...I will have to tell Car about this! :) I'll write later, hopefully my home computer will be fixed soon!

      I'm finally doing something for me and it feels damn good! okay so it didnt at first...and i was scared to tell my girlfriends about Nathan and now that they know it just feels so good. they like him, well Al and Colie do, i guess thats all that matters for now anyway. Its hard, hard hard hard--HARD to not care what people think, as much as i like to think that i never care what people think and that im my own person and compleatly independant, its still not true. THINK FOR YOUR SELF CAITLIN!!!
