						    Thomas A. Reinsmith:  Old School Fool Getting Older.   Welcome!  This is the TR blog.  As an introduction please allow me to introduce myself.  I am a sophomore at Central Michigan University working toward a B.S. in Ed.; History major, Phys. Ed. minor.  I have recently transferred here from Lansing Community College where I attended off-and-on for six long years.  I transferred before the fall semester 2003.  Just to toot my own horn, I have made the Dean’s List for both of my semesters here.  I have recently joined the National Society for Collegiate Scholars which I have little knowledge of, but it sounds good.  For those of you who may have known me in High School it may surprise you that I have decided on becoming a teacher.  My academic experience in high school was not pleasant.  I think I ended up with a 1.12 gpa.  I was much more successful in the social aspect of HS.  I did not realize in my youth that education is a personal thing.  I regret that I allowed social bullshit to interfere with my schooling, and consequently my life.  I decided upon teaching after becoming closer to my niece and nephews, Jessica, Julius, and Kyle.  Seeing them get older and grow up is one thing that has solidified my interest in teaching.  I wish I had the knowledge at their age that I do now, so why not help others get that knowledge earlier.  I also believe that social barriers exist in our schools that are extremely detrimental to many young people.  As a teacher I will work extremely hard to provide for my charges the support they need, regardless of social position.  My hobbies are sports and music.  I played football and ran track in high school.  I have also played in various basketball and softball leagues.  I currently help my brother, Aaron, with coaching the Perrinton-Middleton Little League team, the Mud Dawgs.  We are currently 2-3.  Coaching little league has also cemented my decision to teach.  It is not easy to keep everyone behaving themselves but it is so much fun to see the kid’s progress.  I am also a big fan of Detroit professional teams.  It is not easy to be a Lions fan or a Tigers fan, but I can’t change.  I have a problem with fair-weather fans.  I also believe that it is just plain wrong to route for Green Bay if you live in Michigan.  Go Pistons!  I was 12 when the “Bad Boys” won their championships and I would love for them to win another.  My other hobby is music.  I would say it is more of a way of life than a hobby.  I play guitar; as well as drums, bass, and mandolin, and I can hack out tunes on about anything.  I had the advantage of working at the best music store in the world, Elderly Instruments, for five years.  This experience allowed me to advance my musicianship as well as gave me connections that allowed me to play in a couple of local bands.  In the late 90’s I played drums for Zephyrean Weave, a “hippy band” as some of my friends have dubbed it.  We played many shows for almost three years, until I was kicked out.  Another band that I was kicked out of is Sun King.  I played guitar in this band, but this lasted only for a brief time.  I was kicked out of these bands for two reasons:  I was young and “insensitive" and I am very anal about musical performance when it reflects on my abilities.  I guess another reason could be that I am an arrogant jerk.  My most recent band was Porno Jazz, in which I played bass.  These guys are great, they didn’t even kick me out of their band!  These guys, and gal, are still playing.  Go to one of their shows if you get a chance.  Visit the website (www.porno-jazz.com). Buy the E.P. and get a chance to listen to my bass playing.  Most importantly try the veal.  I currently just play at home for fun and practice but I would love to start a band.  I have come to the conclusion, however, that I will only be in a band playing guitar.  My influences are Zappa, Miles, Satch, Dylan, Marley, and the Beatles.  I am also heavily influenced by the “gangsta” rap of the 90s especially Ice Cube and Snoop.  Anyone interested in playing some Jazz/Blues/Funk/Hip Hop?

						   I believe that every human being is created equal and given by god certain rights.  Of those are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.  I believe this to be true of all people, regardless of their location. Ethnicity, nationality, heritage, royalty, nobility, etc…. is all a bunch of BULL$HIT.  We are all the same race.  No one is anything other than a human.  Being human has no link to wealth or social status.  The rights of humanity belong to all equally.  No one is any more than someone.  I just happen to be a cracker, but I can not take credit (or blame) for what other crackers have done, know why?  I was not f#@$ing there!  I was born in the USA, but I’m supposed to be Irish?  What then constitutes being American, Irish, Italian, African, etc.  If it is not geographic location then what is it?  Ethnicity?  What is that, other than a social system?  I was not raised in an Irish society, so how am I Irish?  I am not an Irish-American, I am an American.  To me being American is not my nationality.  Nationalism implies an heir of superiority that I do not feel.  I do not believe that Americans are better than, just as an example, Iraqis.  I feel that all people are created equal and are given by God, not a government, certain rights including ….  The words of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are, to me, some of the most beautiful in history.  Our system is the culmination of the Enlightenment, and the relationship between the government and the people that it portrays is revolutionary.  We, the people, are not subjects of, but the power behind this government.  It is because of my belief in the equality of all that I am an American.  It is true that America and Americans have not always lived up to this ideal; this fact, however, does not make this vision invalid.

						    Joe Dumars is my hero!   I always liked Joe Dumars as a player.  He is the epitome of defensive basketball.  Remember when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated for being the only man who could stop Michael Jordan.  It is no wonder that his basketball team, the Detroit Pistons, is formed in his image.  The roster moves he has made have brought this team from being a mediocre team at best, to a contender for the NBA Championship.  Unfortunately I can not forget the "Teal Era" when the Pistons were a collection of undersized power forwards, Grant Hill, and Joe Dumars.  Although they made the playoffs a couple times, this team was never a contender.  The team was not much better even after the addition of Jerry Stackhouse.  After Joe retired things went from bad to worse.  Grant Hill left shortly before Joe was named Director of Basketball Operations.     Thank you Grant Hill!!   Joe was able to work a sign-and-trade with Orlando that brought us two players that were just thrown in;  Big Ben Wallace, and Chucky Atkins.  As it turns out the Pistons got the better deal.  Grant has played only briefly since he left, and Ben is an all star and the foundation of what we now know as Piston basketball.  Over the next few years Joe traded away the high-priced low-talent players to bring in guys with only one year left on their contract, freeing up salary cap space in the process.  Joe was also able to swing trades to bring in Corliss Williamson and John Barry, both of whom, along with Michael Curry and Uncle Cliffy Robinson, were instrumental in the rebirth of the Pistons.  Then, in a surprise move, Joe displayed his willingness to take a chance to make his team better in trading our only "Superstar" player, Jerry Stackhouse, for a young guy named Rip Hamilton.  This was one of Joe's riskier moves, and he was criticized at the time.  Joe also used the teams new cap space to sign free agent journeyman point guard Chauncey Billups.  Joe also drafted a kid out of Kentucky named Tayshaun and an unknown Turkish player, Mehmet Okur.  Most recently Joe made the controversial pick of Darko over Mello.  It might take a few years, but Darko looks like he could be a legitimate center.  The jury is still out on that one.  If Darko lives up to his (I hate this word) Potential, then this too can be seen as a masterful decision.  If not, then he gets lumped with Rodney White and Mateen Cleaves.  Joe has redeemed himself on his draft history.  He has at least been able to trade his mistakes and get something for them.  The   Coup de Grace   was of course the deal that brought the Pistons Rasheed Wallace.  How Joe managed to talk the Hawks and Celtics into this trade astounds me.  It was unfortunate to see Chucky go, but this move also brought the Pistons Mike James Bi%&#.  Boston decided not to keep Lindsey Hunter, who the Pistons traded away in this deal.  The Pistons quickly re-signed him.  Mike and Lindsey, now known as the Pit Bulls, are one of the best backup backcourts in the league.  All of the moves that Joe has made have panned out.  Ben is two time Defensive Player of the Year AND SHOULD HAVE WON A THIRD THIS YEAR! Corliss has been a monster, mainly in the regular season, but a monster all the same.  Rip has made huge shots in the playoffs this year, Chauncey has given us strength at the point as well as another weapon, and Tayshaun saved the final two games in the Indiana series with blocked shots.  The addition of Rasheed at the end of the year has led to their current playoff run.  In only four years Joe has turned the Pistons into serious title contenders.  Aside from player personnel decisions, Joe has made great choices in head coach.  Joe gave then Pacers assistant coach Rick Carlisle the head coaching job.  Rick then proceeded to win back-to-back Central Division championships with the Pistons, as well as yet another this year with the Pacers.  Joe made another controversial decision before the beginning of this season.  He let Carlisle go to bring in Hall-of-Famer Larry Brown.  Although Larry was not able to capture the Central Division championship, he was able to bring something more special to Detroit, the Eastern Conference Championship.  The Pistons are in the finals now, ready to meat a tough L.A. team.  Will the Pistons be able to pull off the upset?   If Joe Dumars' team wins this NBA championship, he deserves to be the president of the entire stinking world!!!    GO PISTONS

						   Please see the previous post.  I am not a christian, a muslim, a jew, a buddhist, a hindu, and I am most definitely not an atheist.  You may ask, "How can you believe in god but not be a christian/muslim/jew?"  I respect the teachings of all religions, but I can not state that any one is the TRUTH.  Call me of little faith, and whatnot, but hey, I am not that smart that can state that I know what is unknowable.  There is a question that has lingered throughout history, "what's it all about."  What is the answer to Life, the Universe and everything, other than 42 (hitchhikers)?  This question, as questions often do, led to more questions.  Why is it that humans are congnizent and no other animal seems to be?  There are animals that communicate, solve problems, even make tools, but why are humans the only ones on this planet to exhibit our brand of intelligence.  The previous statement may be contended.  That humans are the only ones who understand the coming of death can't be.  This makes us the only ones who question as we do.  Sheer Darwinist thinking can not explain this to me.  If it is merely evolution then it must be that humans out competed every form of being that displayed similar mental or lingual characteristics.  This seems possible, yet why do animals that would not share a niche with humans not develop such intelligence, or even something similar?  If our self awareness is only consequence of evolution then what is the meaning of life.  Given only this as a basis, the entire purpose of one's life would only be survival of the genetic line.  Since our abilities were developed to survive, then survival and procreation are the only meaning of life.  Humans ask questions of not only life but of death.  To an atheist there is nothing after death, only the rearrangement of molecules and energy.  This picture of life and death is not exiting.  Is there nothing more to life than life?  This is a picture of a meaningless existence.  To all atheists; Since time is infinite, and our existence definite, do we exist at all, or are we worthless pyres of cosmic energy?  It may be arrogance, but I refuse to envision that humanity has been awakened and separated from the other animals for absolutely no reason whatsoever, other than successful survival.  The philosophical dilemmas that have plagued us are questions that would not be asked by an organism focused merely on survival.  What purpose would these questions serve?  I believe that God separated us from the animals. I believe it is God that has made us self aware and that God has a reason and a purpose for us all.  We are not simply wasting away the rest of the big bang.  What we are here for is an unanswerable question, at least in this existence.  I personally believe god has given us a problem.  That we must come together as humanity and learn to live peacefully on, and with, the Earth.  I see religious teachings as being a way to achieve this goal.  But since our religions are to busy playing the "I'm right, you're wrong" game we lose sight of the true goal and thus are not doing a good job at this at all.  What is after death?  I have no Idea.  I would like to think that this world is a test, and that there is more to existence than just this.  If this is true than I believe that being a good person, while on this earth, is extremely important.  If nothing exists after death then this is it.  Therefore, being a good person is less a necessity, but a way to achieve greater happiness. Either way you look at it,  IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE A GOOD PERSON .

						   Hey this is my religious belief rant.  I hope I am able to Pi$$ some of y’all off so you start thinking about this crap.  Just some background on me.  I have never attended church, but come from a christian (cracker) background.  I have always been a philosopher of sorts, mainly just to satisfy my own questioning.  I’ve been into the thought of a new synthesis religion that would stop everyone from killing each other. To quote a great philosopher “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one.” (Lennon)  I think it’s about time that the whole world took a step back.  No longer do we live in darkness and isolation.  The information revolution has made a world perspective not only possible, but inevitable.  How many hundreds of years more will people die for their “religion”?  I am not a scholar of any religious teachings by any sense, but I don’t seem to remember any religious teachings that preach the values of killing another human.  I’ve been told that christianity and islam are based on judaism and the old testament.  Again, all y’all please tell me where I’m mistaken but isn’t that where the ten commandments come from, and is “thou shalt not kill” the first one on the list?  Why is it then that killing in the name of faith has been so prevalent throughout history?  I do not have to list all the wars that were based solely on religion.  Who then controls religion?  I can not believe that god would use religion as a instrument of murder. 	 I contend that religion is not a creation that comes from god, it is a corruption of spirituality used by men to obtain and maintain power (constantine's dream had nothing to do with god).  One of the unique aspects of the United States is our separation of church and state.  Before our little experiment, the state and the religion were almost always heavily intertwined.  This is religions true face, politics and power.  What is more powerful than controlling the thoughts and fears of another.  To make the rules of what is acceptable to say, do, or think.  This power can rally the people around their leaders or their nation.  Even make people willing to sacrifice their lives and to destroy the lives of others in the name of righteousness.  Religion has been used as an instrument only in the hands of elites and leaders to bend the will of their people.  The will of the elite, not that of god, has been the driving force in religion. 	 This may sound like a very anti-religious rant, and, it is.  I apologize to all those who cannot separate religion, as a social/political entity, from the spiritual beliefs that religion teaches.  The lessons contained in the teachings and holy works of the different religions are amazing pieces of knowledge and wisdom, that when followed lead humanity on the path to peace and prosperity.  Religion has deffinitely brought about much goodness and beauty to this world.  My contention is with the way religion has been corrupted by those who wish to separate people.  I don’t believe that god condones the acts of all christians, or that allah condones the acts of all muslims, or that jaweh condones the acts of all jews.  I also cannot believe that there are no hindus or buddhists that deserve to be in christian heaven.  FACT:  nobody knows what the truth is.  Many philosophers would be pi$$ed off if we did.  Not one person can prove that any other religion is more true than another.  All religions teach a way to goodness, only the details are slightly different.  This is why I must still ask; WHY ARE WE KILLING EACH OTHER?  The teachings of the worlds religions are all accessible.  Instead of arrogantly denouncing them, we need to find the bridges that can unite humanity.  That is a more noble goal than dominance through brutality.  It is not good enough, either, to simply say that religion is a war of attrition.  If the good of all mankind is the purpose for religion, than we are doing religion an injustice when we subvert the good of all to only the good of “my” people.

						   Isn't it funny that after the Pistons demolished the Lackers the national media talks more about the Laker offseason plans than the Pistons winning the NBA Championship!  It is disappointing to me that the media does not believe Piston fans deserve some coverage of their team, even after winning the NBA Championship.  The ABC postgame show was about the Lakers not the Champions!  The media bias was bad enough before the Pistons clinched the NBA Championship but I figured that after winning it would change.  I was wrong.  Apparently to ABC and the NBA the Pistons are not worth talking about.  The message I take from this is that I am not as valuable as a Laker fan.  It's ridiculous to have to listen to biased TV coverage.  During the regular season it's just fine to have a bias, but the finals are not a Laker home game.  It seemed as though Al Michaels starts every sentence with, "The Lakers...".Talk about the offseason in the offseason.   The Pistons deserve respect .   I, as a Pistons fan, deserve respect from the media.   The Lakers are a soap opera, I LIKE BASKETBALL!  Kobe Bryant is not the next Michael Jordan he is the next Anfernee Hardaway.  Some people said Anfernee was the next MJ, but when Shaq took off suddenly he's not so great anymore.  Granted they are very good players, but greatness requires more than fancy moves and a good jumper.  It is very ironic that Karl Malone's new team got beat by the Pick-n-Roll.  The play he and John Stockton almost perfected comes back to bite him in the ...knee?  I know Gary Peyton WAS good, but why is he a Hall-of-Famer?  Was he better than Joe Dumars, Bill Laimbeer, Vinny Johnson, or Mark Aguirre???  What did he ever win?  Is Jerry Stackhouse a Hall-of-Famer?  He put up some huge numbers also, does this qualify him?  If he played in LA would he be considered one?  Shaq is a dominant force, it's too bad the "Zenmaster" doesn't know how to use him.  The Pistons played him pretty straight up in every game.  I was told Shaq would "Break Wilt's single game scoring record" against single coverage.  I didn't see or hear about any adjustments made to get him the ball more.  The only ones they mentioned were to get Kobe Bryant to the free-throw line more.  He sure used some zen on the refs.  Maybe he wanted his players to stop thinking about winning and concentrate on the officiating.  It worked wonders.  It sure looked like Jackson was out-coached by Larry Brown to me.    The Laker fans complain about bad officiating.  This, of course, is ridiculous.  The Lakers always get the calls, ask Vlade Divac.  Just this year the Lakers have benefited from some iffy calls.  Derek Fisher seems to be the only person ever to be able to catch-and-shoot in less than .6 seconds.  Ask Kelvin Torbert of Michigan State about that rule.  The only game the Lakers managed to win in this series hinged on a questionable call.  Conceding the bunny, both Ben and Rasheed went straight up against Shaq and the refs gave the Lakers a chance by blowing the whistle for a three point opportunity.  Had that call not been made, the Lakers would have been down by four points.  They would have needed to foul and hope for missed free-throws.  Assuredly, the Lakers would have lost.  Regardless...   The Detroit Pistons are the 2004 NBA Champions
