      I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye  anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again   This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye  anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on her hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do

      Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on His back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had been on vacation.   Every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one-hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by  all the activity and color of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.   One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn't hear the band, he could see it. In his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days and weeks passed.   One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of he man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window.   The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you."

      3 days ago i was too happy, my mom called all my siblings and we just sat in the dining room for some talk! as in we're complete! ofcourse without my papa who happened to work in korea..so hes not here! Pero first time na sama-sama kmi uli..mdami kc kming mgkakapatid, i have an older brother and 3 sisters! minsan lng kc kmi uli mgkasama-sama because of different time management! kuya is always outside the house, i only saw my mom at night because of her work, etc.. but then there's one moment that we're united and talk about.... wahahaha-->cost cutting!! Its because our meralco bill was way too high!! But then our conversation had brought us into different topics..as in ang saya!! my family are so smart..icipin nio kht maliit na bagay pinagatatalunan!! pero indi negative ha..ung nagkakatuwaan, laging may debate!! may pulutan pa kami!Ü..

      Fallin' out, fallin' in  Nothings sure in this world, no no  Breaking down, breaking in  Never knowing what lies ahead  We can really never tell it all, no no  Say goodbye, say hello  To a lover or friend Sometimes we  never could understand  Why some things begin with just love  We can never have it all No no no ohh   But oh, can't you see  That no matter what happens  Life goes on and on And so baby just smile  Cause I'm always around you  And I'll make you see  How beautiful life is  For you and me   # Take a little time baby    See the butterfly's colors    Listen to the birds    That were sent to sing    For me and you    Can you feel me?    This is such a wonderful place to me    Even if there is pain now    Everything will be alright    For as long as the world still turns    There will be night and day    Can you hear me?    There's a rainbow always After the rain   Hittin' high, hittin' low  Win or lose, you should go Yeah yeah  Getting warm, getting cold W eather can be so good or bad  But baby, this is life so don't get mad No no no   Life's full of challenges Not all the time We get what we want But don't despair, my dear You'll take it each trial And you'll make it through the stormCause youre strong My faith in you is clear So I say once again This world's beautifulLet us celebrate life That is so beautiful So beautiful...

      yesterday was the day ive waited for so long, harry potter and the prisoner of askhaban is now on showing! i watched the movie with my old classmates on high school (ron, clo-ann, kris, rj, milka, angela, lourdes, kaye and me). eventhough we're not completem and closest friends we're not there, the day has became funny and ofcourse bcoz of the movie. they ate first at greenwhich (whehehe, kris and i didnt ate bcoz we ate already in our house..thats why we're so late!!Ü).. then we went to the movie!! it was so cold there and my concentration was affected by it, so we all decided to repeat watching it! ive noticed too many scenes in the book that were not incuded in the movie, the director also put some comedy that made it so appealing to those who didn't read the book..hehe!!
