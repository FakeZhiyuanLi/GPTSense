       Ah, the last day of summer here at last!  Tonight I have a curfew!  I have to be in bed so I can be up for school in the morning! Why does it all seem like a dream?  It doesn't seem like tomorrow is real.  It's so odd. People keep asking me if I'm serious about wanting to go back to school.  I totally am.  And they find that hard to believe, because to them, every teen hates school and would rather see it burn then go into it again.  But I love school.  It gives me something to do, allows me to take my mind off the drama of life.  The only thing I don't like is that it takes away very valuble writing time! ;) Last night I hung out with my friend Amy and the new forgien( I was watching unsolved mysteries this morning... I was so bored... and it was actually more like afternoon... but anyway, I used to think that was the scariest show in the world.  But today, I found myself laughing at it...  ~~*~~   Robert Stack:  And that's when they found a body....  Weird guy #1:  Oh my God, it's a body.  Weird guy #2: Yes... a body...  Weird guy #1: What should we do?  Weird guy #2: Let's poke at it with sticks!  Robert Stack: They poked at it with sticks for three hours, then finally called the police.  Police guy:  Yep, that's a bleepin' dead body if I've ever bleepin'  saw one.  Coroner: Yep, he's dead.  Rookie cop: Let's poke at it with a stick!  Robert Stack:  While the police poked at the body, CSI came and collected evidence, the responsible thing to do...  ~~*~~   Ok so maybe that's not how it happened, but that's what I was thinking the whole time... people back in the '50's had trouble with collecting evidence, and that bugged me!  But what can I say, except for I'm a CSI freak!! Adios!

       Ok, so I so don't know where that came from, but there it is. I'm tired, and I can't go to sleep. But sleep is overrated, right? Right. I'm trying to write in my blog, but people on MSN keep talking to me. I love them to death, but that little NOTICE ME noise is annoying! Ugh! So, I'm trying to work on a comedy story that I adopted from another fanfic writer. It's so hard. I used to be fairly good at comedy, but now... I don't know. I'm good at randomly making up stupid things to do or say to my friends, but I never realized how hard it is to write funny stuff down. Time to let the creative juices flow....  ~~*~~            Author:  Ha, it is I, the author, come to control your life with just the pressing down of a few keys! Muahaha!!!  Grissom:  Whatever happened to 'you control your own destiny.'  Author: It went out the door, along with morals and a clean story!  Sara: Great.  Just great.  So basically, that means you've put us in a demented world with death, gore, drugs and smut?  Grissom:What's wrong with smut?  *Sara hits Grissom in the arm.  He yelps and shuts his mouth.*  Nick: And what about the rest of us, where do we come in? We never get a good role in a fanfic. It's always either Sara and Griss getting it on, or Catherine and Griss.  *Grissom shudders at the last thought*  Warrick: Yeah, when do I get to be paired up with the love of my life?  Author: And who do you suggest I pair you with, Greg?  *Greg looks at Warrick and blows him a kiss.  Warrick shudders*  Warrick: Nevermind.  ~~*~~  You see, I just can't write funny. Well, I guess that was kinda funny, but still, you'd have to be a fan of CSI to understand most of it! Anyway, did I mention already that this is a totally random post to get me started so I can FINALLY start this thing? Well, if I didn't, this is a totally random post to get me started so I can FINALLY start this thing. And with that said, I'm gonna go now! Goodnight, all!

        Yeah, so, here I am after surfing the web like crazy trying to find something to do... And I guess I found an outlet for my mad writing self. And I guess I found a place to just be me. YAY!! I don't even know when to start... but that figures. The best stories always have the oddest beginnings. Not that my story is really good or anything, just different. I'm a senior in high school now. It's amazing to look back at the last 12 or 13 years and see what I've done. Remember the people I've met. The dreams I've had. I can't believe this is already almost over. I'm almost an adult. This is so sweet!! And my CSI obsession continues to grow, along with my writing skills. I can't believe how well my stories are being recieved. How much people like them! It's just so amazing to think that people like what I post. Hmmm, that's pretty nifty. And marching band has started again, minus the drama. :: Pauses, takes a deep breath :: YAY!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, I'm better now. It just feels so nice to be able to not worry about that stuff, and focus on the music... the marching. The last few years nobody's been able to do that, but now... I just know it's gonna be an amazing year. We'll at least make it to states. We have to. It's my senior year! And my last chance to make a difference!! Adios!

         Grissom stared at Sara, his deep blue eyes pleading with her words he couldn't bring himself to say. His fingers tightened their grip on her wrist as he gently pulled her to him. She stared up at him, her eyebrows still furrowed in anger, but her irises were dark with anticipation. "Don't go... please... I need you," Grissom whispered hoarsly as he tried to keep the tears that threatened to fall from escaping. Sara swallowed hard and licked her dry lips.  She smiled weakly and brought a soft hand to his cheek. "Grissom... you have me."  ~~*~~        I've been thinking lately that romance is fun to write. Not that evil, gross, smutty kind, but the clean kind. And I could never write NC-17 stuff. It's just not me.    I don't know why I like writing. I guess it's because it allows me to escape my world and create another one. I have control of everything in this world that I create, whereas in real life, it's all up to God. I like to create situations where a person could live or die, find true love or lose it. And using characters from a TV show is even more fun, 'cause when a situation doesn't occur on the TV show , and you think it should have, you can write that out and make it happen. And reader's of fanfiction love that. I love that.    It's all about being creative. Where will my imagination lead me after the scene above? There are so many things that could happen, but only I hold the power to decide what will happen. And that's totally kick butt!  ~~*~~   He knew he'd never be able to let her go once he wrapped his arms around her. She snuggled closer to him and planted a small kiss on his neck. He smiled as he whispered. "I guess I'm not too late?" Sara pulled away from him slightly, and gently kissed his lips. "You could never have been too late." Grissom took her hand as he lead her out of his doorway, and back into his townhouse. She walked in, and he paused, taking one last look at the sun coming up on the horizen. It was a good day to be alive, and it would be for years to come.  ~~*~~   I'm such a shipper!! And not very good with endings... lol!
