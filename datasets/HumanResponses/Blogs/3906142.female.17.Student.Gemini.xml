      Dreams really don't come true... Last time I would hope to dream of "him" as that is the only way to feel him. But when I really dreamt of him, I would realise the outcome would be opposite. Why liking someone is so painful and difficult?? Am I wrong to love him and hold onto him?  Why my friends begged me to forget him and let go? For 1 year, I always think of him, thinking of all the possibilities that caused him to change. How would someone change drastically overnight?! It's impossible... I am unable to accept it... What had I done wrong that caused him to leave me without explanation?!  Why are you so heartless to me.... Why are you treating me this way... Why.... Why forgetting you is so difficult?! WHY!! IF ONLY I never liked you, I would be much happier now! Why do I still care so much for you know.. Why do I have to like you, when you don't even care... Why am I doing all these for you when I know you would never be back to me again????

      &nbsp; I have lose almost everything I once had... I no longer have the confidence I once carried for myself... I am losing control of myself and is no longer at the right "side" of my mind. Sometimes I would just cry on my bed, thinking of what I had gone through... I am really very tired... Why do I have to go through so many obstacles and in the end, I still lose them?? &nbsp; Why do I have to face all these alone?? For 2 years, my life was never going any better. 2 years back, it was my ex boyfriend who made my life miserable and upside down. Just when I thought everything would be better after we break, things became even worst than I expected. 1 year back, the guy I love a lot left me. I left my ex boyfriend 2 years ago was because of this particular guy whom I thought I love, and yet this guy leeft me 1 year ago. Perhaps this is retribution...  &nbsp; Why did I love someone who never love me? Why did I choose to hold onto him and never wanted to give up? Why was I so foolish and silly? I loved him a lot... I knew I couldn't do without him... When he left me, I was very scared he would forget me. I used to hate him for being heartless and cruel, but I never did hate him. The fact is I no longer blame him for anything now, because my feeling is already numb.

        Today I bought 3 sets of uniform for my attachment in hospital. It is a simple white dress and looks plain. However, I like it a lot, perhaps is something "new" to me?    Today is my 2nd week in poly and well, so far so good. Nothing much to comment and felt numb in many ways.    Towards relationship, I have nothing much to comment. My heart seem to be drifting further away and don't know where it is going to land.   Today lectures are quite boring, because of the lecturer monotonous teaching and the long duration in school.    I reached home and tried on the uniform which I would be wearing for 3 years, starting from next month. Well, with the uniform on, I felt weird and nervous.The thought of having to wear that uniform for my attachment make me "shivered".    Tomorrow lesson starts at 11am and ends at 6pm again.. omg... what a long duration of break again!

        Sometimes I would wonder what would life be in 3 years time.. At that time, I might have graduate from Poly, that is provided I pass all my modules and examination. I would be 20 years old 3 years later and is no longer a teenager.    Some would say it is a great moment for me, because I would turn 21 soon and I can be freed from any "home control". But I don't think i would be overjoy with that idea of turning 20 years old. Because I still love my teenage life now... Haha.    3 years passes fast, especially if I never pay much notice to it. For the past 4 years, it had been wonderful and nostalgic for me. 4 years of education in my secondary school had gave me lots of memories, happiness and also sadness..    10 years later, I would be an adult, 27 years old. At that time, I do hope my parents would still be with me. I love my family members and my parents love me a lot too. It is "love" that bonded us together as one, and I dare not think of the day when my mum or dad would leave me.    I have a nephew who is 3 years old this year. He is very adorable and lovely baby. His innocent eyes, chubby cheek and naive laughter often lighten my days and erased my stress some times. I dote him the most because he is very innocent, with no motive... Human beings are very scary, and you are not be able to judge a human being by they way they talk to you. Even a friend whom you have known for a life time might betray you, and this is human's nature. It is really very scary, and it is only during adolescent period when they r the purest.    How I hope my nephew can be a baby forever, as it would be the best time for him in his life. With no worries, no pain and no stress, won't that be great?   Sometimes I do hope there is a device which can be used to erase unhappy memories, or perhaps if necessary, delete happy memories away too. Having lots of memories about the past might not be a good thing too. When you recall those happy moments you shared with someone, it could be nostalgia sometimes. And when you realise those are just memories and that it might not happen again in the future, you might just felt depressed about it. And that is when happy memories could cause you to feel sad. If that is the case, why not just let me start all over again, at the point when I need not carry any memories and start my life all over again?

      4 years ago, I was still a secondary 1 student. Free from worries, free from stress and free from depression. Just a simple, happy go lucky girl. Now, I am occupied with stress, worries, pain, depression and sadness. My friends seemed to be leaving me one by one.. Everyday I would wake up with the hope of receiving some messages from any friends, as it shows they care? I am grateful to God for giving me a group of close pals, and that they had brought me laughter. When I was sad, they consoled me. When I cried, they comforted me. When I needed them, they were there for me.  But why is God bringing them further from me now? We are all separated into different institutions and have lesser chances to hang out. Perhaps God is showing me how tough is my fiendship with them.  But God, why did you bring him into my life when you never intended to let him stay? I don't know the reason for his leaving and I don't know God's reason for bringing him into my life in the first place. Perhaps God want to give me an obstacle to go through in order to become independent and emotionally strong? Perhaps by doing this, I would treasure my new friends, everyone I come across with more care and genuine love? If sacrificing "him" for all these "love" and "attention" i give to others, then it is worth it.  I believe God would make my life a better one. I might be depressed, sad and could not get over "his incident" yet, but i believe God would make my life a much better one by bringing someone who loves me more than "he" does into my life again. This is the faith I hold for God and I pray that God will show me the way to light and happiness. I am tired of being sad everyday... I seemed to be cheerful and smiling all the time, but I don't know is that the "real" me or is that just a mask of my own. I missed those times with "him", my friends. I seemed to have lose the courage to take a further step into my next stage in life because I fear of failure.  I wanted to give in my best effort in everyone, in everything I do, but it seemed rather difficult for me. The more I give, the more I would lose.

      Today is my 5th day in poly... Things were not as bad as I had expected and I started to like my new life in poly. My first week in poly was smooth sailing and I pray hard that my next 3 years would be easy for me.  I missed my secondary pals, sharon, kelly, junjie etc... I missed "him" too.. I missed the 4 years in Springfield Secondary and I missed the times my friends and I shared. I felt sad when I had to leave my friends and start my new stage in life without anyone of them near me. Perhaps this is a growing stage for me to become independent.  Kelly had changed and we no longer talked much. She told me to have confidence with my friends and myself, but why is she not doing that too? I hate to see her drifting away from me... Sharon is still the same, happily studying in MDIS every week. She does not has many friends and dare not mix around with the others. This is her, and perhaps this is why I like her as a friend too? JunJie is a funny and interesting guy, my close guy-pal whom I know in sec 2. He is studying in Singapore Poly with Jermin, Cheryl and Sheena. What a lucky fellow! He sprained his ankle yesterday and I "laughed". That is him, always clumpsy and complaining. And that is what makes him "real". Jermin is Junjie's best pal and they known each other since primary school days. I know Jermin through JunJie and well, not really close with him but he is a nice and kind guy. A friend whom i know for 1 year already, thanks to junjie.  Don't intend to talk much about "him", the guy whom i missed a lot. Let's name "him" as JF. JF was a friend whom I trusted the most and because of that, I was deeply hurt when he broke his promise. A promise which changed my life for more than a yr and perhaps, for the following years too.  My friends said I should let go and start life anew. So do I, and I was hoping and looking forward to start anew with someone else some day. But before that day come, I would still remember "him", a friend who had left deepest memories in my life for the past few years. I don't hate him because he never asked me to like him. I was giving myself forlorn hopes since the starting of our friendship.
