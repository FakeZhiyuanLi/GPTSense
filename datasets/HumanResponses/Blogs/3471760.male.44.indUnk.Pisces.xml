      To whom it may concern, folks like me, you used to burn. You’d do it all again today, if given the chance and you had your way.  You call yourselves the Christian Right, Spreading hate, your “God given right.” Prejudice, unknowing, diversity naught, Where in your book is all of this taught?  Really only the names have been changed, The faces, ideas, and beliefs are the same. Matthew Shepherd tied to a fence and burned, After all of these years, no lessons you’ve learned.  The vile words spread, the beliefs that you share, encourage these actions, the blame you shall bare. Ignorance, closed-minded, spreading hate, I fail to see where exists a debate.  I am not sure to what God you pray, however, it’s clear that YOU’VE lost your way. Some peace I feel, wisdom reveal, hatred in words your Godly device, what you send out WILL come back to you thrice.

      Ohm is the sacred sound,  before our souls were earthly bound. Ohm echoed through the mist, endless whirl and endless twist.  Ohm swirled through time and space,  before a species or a race. Ohm sang her song of One, before Lord Shivas’ dance was done.  Dance, whirl, emerald spark, life created from the dark. Emerald mist and emerald moon, Ohm still sings her sacred tune.  Forest green and life abound,  One still hears the sacred sound. If you stand still among the trees, sense the earth, feel emerald breeze, you will hear the sacred sound,  touch your heart and life abound.

      My spiritual journey began in the Christian church as I felt it was my obligation to attend.  Of course, I NEVER felt comfortable or welcome there.  I also had too many questions that no one seemed to be able to answer.  I also felt it prohibited me from celebrating my being and seeing this life as sacred.  Many things they considered sin, just happened to be part of my spirituality.  Although, I have always been Pagan in my heart, my next step was picking up a book on Buddhism while living in Mexico!  An instant bond and fascination for the teachings of Buddha gave me a great sense of well-being, direction, and purpose.  Buddhist philosophy and its emphasis on enlightenment and respect for the planet helped to solidify my now expanding concept of spirituality.  I did all I could to learn about and practice Buddhism.     Since Buddhism stepped out of Hinduism, much of the Hindu philosophy, mythology, and Gods and Goddesses all held an extreme fascination for me.  The beautiful artwork, the teachings of the Bagavad Gita, Upanishads, and the Vedas were excellent grounding and teachings in my introduction to an even deeper understanding of eastern thought and mysticism.  However, not being born in India (Indiana is a long way from India), not being born into Hinduism and feeling I had a lot to learn, how could I be Hindu?  With the advent of the internet and bookstores carrying more books on "alternative religions,"  I was introduced to Wicca.  Now, I was at home... Wicca applied to a more western audience and held great interest for me with my Irish Heritage, yet it seemed surprisingly akin to Hinduism.  With Wicca, I could choose my own path, hold sacred this life, planet and universe, honor nature in all of its forms, respect for animals, and combine both masculine and feminine energies.  Also, my sexual preference was not a problem, and many people were able to actually use this as a spiritual awakening. Words like Karma, The Law of Three, Reincarnation (Rebirth), meditation, art, dance, music, all combined as a sum of all parts.    As I began practicing Eclectic Wicca, I kept Buddha, Shiva, and Ganesha on the other side of the room.  I guess I felt it was disrespectful to mix and match even though Wicca and Hinduism were very similar in so many ways, each with its own offerings.  I also thought I might offend someone who claims to be strictly Buddhist, Hindu, or even Wiccan.  I compare this thinking to  "Wicca fundamentalism" just like Christian fundamentalism.    As Pagans, we all pretty much agree that there is NO one "right way." So, why was it necessary to separate?  There are MANY Pagans and Wiccans who mix beliefs, Hindus choose various paths, and so do Buddhists.  Even Christians have many many denominations.  Although there are various distinctions concerning each path, they all hold a basic core belief to that particular religion..   So, now I was a Witch (Wise One) but seemed to think it best to keep Shiva, Ganesha, and Buddha on the other side of the room. However, with more reading, studying, learning, and application, it started to seem more okay to mix.  More and more, I began mixing my now developing Wiccan practices with Hinduism and Buddhism.    Now I was practicing what seemed like Hindu Wicca.  It also seemed "OKAY!"  My reverance for life, earth, animals, and the universe was perfectly in line with all of these teachings.    My concept of the circle, birth, life, death and rebirth of the universe is perfectly represented in the Hindu God Shiva/Nataraj - Lord of the Dance.  His cosmic swirl with a human face is the combination of both male and female deity yet lack of both.  It is the beginning, the ending, and the rebirth of life and our universe.  It fits my beliefs and combines perfectly well with Wicca.    The Ancient Oak Website says it all perfectly. This website also confirmed my beliefs that it has been "OKAY" all along!   I have found my place...... I am Pagan, my magickal path is Eclectic Hindu Wicca, and I am a Hedgewitch.  Brightest Blessings.  Michael

      You wondered how you found yourself, in the market on a shelf. You knew that you had time to live, love to share and lots to give.   When you saw me watching you, you knew your lonely time was through. An instant bond we both had,  and no longer you felt sad.   As we built trust and you got bolder, you hitched a ride upon my shoulder. Time we spent in the chair  or at my desk without a care.   Although you've crossed the Rainbow Bridge, in my heart you'll always live.   Michael

      I urge all Americans to vote for John Kerry and send a powerful message to Washington that we have, in deed, had ENOUGH!  George Bush says that John Kerry is out of touch with what Americans want, especially people in the heartland. I would therefore assume that George Bush thinks that he is in touch with what we want. I would also assume that he believes he has been giving us what we want for nearly 4 years.  I live in the heartland in the great state of Indiana. I am telling George Bush that I or no one that I know of wants the following.  We have had enough of:  1. A 30% drop in wages for working Americans. 2. Over 3 million jobs lost or moved overseas. 3. False information conveyed to the American public concerning Iraq. 4. Nearly 1,000 American lives lost in Iraq. 6. Haliburton making BIG money on the reconstruction of Iraq. 5. Tax cuts for the top 2% of the wealthy class. 6. Cuts in funding for education and after-school programs. 7. Inability to balance the budget. 8. A skyrocketing debt that will need to be repaid by future generations. 9. The most divided America in history both financially and politically. 10. Changing the constitution of the United States, our most precious document, to exclude certain members of hard-working Americans equal rights concerning health benefits, inheritance, hospital visitation, and insurance.  This would be the first time in the history of our country that the constitution was used to take away or deny civil rights.  11. The flat out refusal to listen to science with an open mind concerning stem-cell research that could hold the key for eliminating certain diseases such as Parkinson's and many many others. 12. An America that is NO LONGER respected in much of the world, and where our government and Americans in general are looked upon as untrustworthy and with contempt. 13. Enough hatred generated in certain parts of the world to keep us in terrorists for years and years to come. 14. National borders that have not been secured in the three years following the 9/11 attacks. Smuggling of human cargo continues all along our borders with terrorists and potential terrorists now freely crossing EVERY SINGLE DAY including the state of Texas. 15. Gas prices at or over $2 a gallon. 16. An economy that simply is NOT working and a general lack of confidence playing havoc on the stock market. 17. Outsourcing of jobs so companies can avoid paying health insurance, vacation, and benefits. 18. Squanderd good will of the entire world after 9/11. 19. Alienation of our greatest and most historical allies as well as the world in general. 20. An insensitivity and arrogance which does NOT allow for even considering that these policies are NOT working!  I believe this explains perfectly well why George Bush has worked sooooooo hard to divide the country into what he simple-mindedly considers either good-evil or worthy-not worthy. ALL THINGS DO  NOT  FIT CONVENIENTLY INTO THOSE BOXES.  He says John Kerry "flip flops on the issues." Well, I am sorry but weighing the pros and cons, learning and growing, expanding and changing with new insights, getting rid of an old idea that no longer works, and listening to the opinions of other Americans and the rest of the world is NOT FLIP-FLOPPING ON ANTHING! This is the sign of a great leader and someone who considers the opinions and ideas of others WORTHY!!! We ALL make changes in our lives and in our decisions. Life is change!  Some things that used to work, now no longer work. This is common sense, this is someone who thinks and would make a strong leader. THIS IS SOMEONE IN TOUCH WITH THE WORLD AROUND THEM.  If we do not see it George's way then we are unpatriotic and lacking values. WELL, HE IS 100%  INCORRECT ! Let me tell you that I am EXTREMELY PATRIOTIC, LOVE MY COUNTRY, AND MY FAMILY (ALL OF US) HAVE VALUES AND FAMILY VALUES. Mr. Bush and his extreme right-wing supporters simply want us to think that only HIS SIDE has values. This way, he can win votes of many unthinking Americans who actually believe that only a Republican can have values or be a good and decent person. With the above record and facts truly stated, it is NO wonder why a divided America would work best for him!  America is for all Americans! He has simply created two Americas by dividing EVERYTHING into good-evil or worthy-not worthy. This makes vote gathering by extremists much much easier. Playing on people's emotions rather than dealing with the serious serious issues that ALL of us as Americans face. We ALL deserve better - my country deserves better!  I have family values as well, and my family means the world to me. Because we quesion his lack of direction and our downward spiral does NOT make us unpatriotic! Americans question or should question faulty practices and policies that are NOT working.        HOWEVER, HE HAS TURNED AMERICANS SO AGAINST EACH OTHER, THAT ALL SOME CAN SEE ARE REPUBLICAN-GOOD, DEMOCRAT-BAD, REPUBLICAN-GOD ON THEIR SIDE, DEMOCRAT-NO VALUES.       Morals and values are practiced not simply spoken about to make people think your "opponents" are somehow without values, morals, and decency. Some people simply cannot or will not see through the smoke and mirrors.       My country CAN DO BETTER! I know we can because we have done better and been better before. If this is compassionate conservatism, it is NOT working!      Please vote for a change in November.      Michael
