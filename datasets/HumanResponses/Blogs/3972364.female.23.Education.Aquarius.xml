      Alright... I just browsed through a ton of blogs. I'm procrastinating working on my thesis... but it's so damn boring! Anyway, people put the stupidest stuff on their blogs! If you want random people to read about your life, don't post 2-word inside jokes... Blogs should be about your life... Or at least something worthwhile. Saying a bunch of random quick words that only your friends understand should be saved for your damn IM away messages. Your mindless blogs are getting in the way of people seeing mine! And mine aren't worthless. Mine are cool. They're not about "I went to the store and bought some flip-flops" but about crazy weird stories that happen to me at the mental hospital or about how I visited Bob Jones University 6 times in high school or about how I had to wear skirts below the middle of my knees to school before they came into style or about how I got kicked out of my Christian high school for having cigarettes in my car (I wasn't even smoking them!) or about how after this happened, I tried to commit suicide (that was long ago, I'm doing fine now, but thanks for asking) and while I was in the hospital being injected with crazy stuff that would make me crap and vomit until I could hardly breathe or swallow my God-fearing, compassionate high school principal was telling my parents how I was expelled. Well, at any rate... I won't bore you with worthless inside jokes. Hell, if you bother to read my blog, you'll be the better for it... you know why? Cuz I've got alot of really weird stories.

      Well, I have so much to say and so little time in which to say it. I'm going to have lots of cool stuff on here, just you wait. All my opinions on stuff and my innovative fashion ideas and my rants and reviews of current fashions... then I'll tell you a thing or two about what it's like to live in Indiana... the most conservative place on earth I fear... and all my fears and opinions about politics.&nbsp; Then somewhere in the middle of it all... I'll tell you about my life.&nbsp; Maybe it will come out as part of the other two subjects, or maybe I'll just feel like ranting. But check back now and again and stay posted to my&nbsp;crazy world and all my opinions thereof. By the way, I work in a mental hospital and I have fascinating stories about my early Christian school experiences...&nbsp; stay tuned! ;-) &nbsp; Lily
