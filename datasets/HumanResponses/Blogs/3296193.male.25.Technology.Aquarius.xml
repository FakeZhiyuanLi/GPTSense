      I've been living in the United States for about 3 years now and I seem to be losing my taste for healthy Dutch Beer. In the past I really enjoyed the heavier beers like Grolsch, Heineken and Amstel. Nowadays I'm much more comfortable with American light beers that keep you sober for a very long time before you finally get drunk. I still have a strong distaste for Bud or Bud Light though. Lately my number one favorite beer is Michelob Ultra. Low carbs and very light :). Is it just normal when you get older or am I totally ruined by the American beer culture?

      The soundtrack is out, so I just had to get it. The first Harry Potter soundtrack was great, the second was more or less the same as the first one (almost no new themes). The third one is superb. Now the latest one is totally different, and only has now and then the familiar themes established on the first two soundtracks. It's a mix of Medieval / Classic and Jazz.

      A couple of weeks ago I needed to get a new passport for which I had to travel all the way to Atlanta. Since it was a four hour drive from Huntsville, I decided to make a whole weekend trip out of it, destination Savannah, GA, which is about four hours from Atlanta. Besides drinking beer and walking through the downtown area we also visited the two old forts in the neighbourhood.

       It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.     I finally saw Fahrenheit 9/11 here in the movie theater this weekend. At first I was afraid they wouldn't show these kind of ultra left wing conspiracy movies in the heart of the bible belt. But in the end we only had to wait one extra week before it actually came out here down south.        Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very powerful movie concerning the major events happening in the last four years. At times its really funny and would have made a fine comedy if only it wasn't based on reality.     Related Links:    urlLink http://www.michaelmoore.com

       "  Elton John has said stars are scared to speak out against war in Iraq because of "bullying tactics" used by the US government to hinder free speech."     Very strange, but I couldn't find any American news source that reported this article. Lucky for us, BBC news stil publishes this kind of news though...     urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3902833.stm
