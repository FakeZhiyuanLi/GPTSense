      Came back from Switzerland and landed at Penang airport all tired on Sunday 6pm. Finally, the trip from Penang to Singapore to Zurich to Thun to Gunten and then back to Penang is over. Now I must get my act together and prepare myself for a coming exam on 8th June. It's only 2 weeks away. Wish me luck.

      Wow... 2 weeks have passed since my 1st blog here. I just finished watching the Thomas Cup semi final match between Denmark and Indonesia. I have done many things in the past 2 weeks of absence here.   I travelled to Melaka, Segamat, Seremban, KL and Genting Highlands by car from Penang for my short excursion break. I like gambling so Genting had to be in the list when I visit KL. It was a wonderful trip. The last time I went to Melaka was like more than 15 years ago. That was a long time ago. Drove up to Genting and put up in Resort Hotel for a night. Won about RM300.00 for one day of gambling....I played the 'bird cage' game.   Just mid of this week, I was planning to go to Switzerland for a 3 day business trip. Supposed to leave tomorrow night (Sat) but the other party will only be available starting next Wed so I had to reschedule my flight. I will be leaving Penang for Zurich on Singapore Airlines transiting in Singapore on Tuesday night (18th May) and will leave Zurich on Sat (22nd May) afternoon. This is my 2nd trip to Switzerland.

      I have been using the net for so long now and believe me this is my first blog.   Nickname: kstang (that's what ppl call me in office) location: penang profession: sales officer by day, freak by night  Ah yes...finally I am going to have my well earned one week holiday starting 1st may to 9th may. I have taken 4 days off from work to get out of town for awhile - to free my mind of all the stress i had to face at work. I spend most of my time hanging around a large textile manufacturing facility in Penang. I have a great job but sometimes shit happens like any other job in the world and I am trying to live with it...at least for now.   This morning...or should i say yesterday morning i went to bangunan tunku syed putra at downing street to meet with one puan saadah at the miti office on the 8th floor. my appointment was set at 8.30am and i got to her office at approx 5 before half past eight. Had to wait for 15 minutes for her to finish her breakfast before I get to speak to her on my issues concerning form d application for export of textiles to vietnam. Meeting with her was quite brief and so i decided to take a short walk to itd, to get my past year exam paper for strategic info system ...june 2003 to be exact. But no...they were still not open at 9am. those lucky bastards.   So I drove from Weld Quay back to office. Took a slow drive along JE expressway and got into office at half past nine. Read and replied some emails and it was already almost 12.30 when i turned and look at the clock. So I went out for lunch at inderawasih for a quick bite and headed back to office. Had some work done in office. Searched, cut and sent some samples to agents in south america and india and before i know it....it was almost five. Quickly I did try to finish up my monthly report for the big boss before he complain again.... email server was down a couple of times but finally managed to send out the report before I go missing for one week.

      Won RM960 from Genting Casino over the weekend. This is by far the most I have won from my trips to Genting. Stayed at the First World Hotel for 1 night. Not so many people on Saturday even in the casino but lots of people on Sunday. Left Genting approx. 3.30pm and reached Penang island about 8.00pm. Yea, we drive very slowly. Had dinner at Super Tanker food court in Lip Sin garden. This place is usually packed during the weekends. Reached home at 9pm.  Woke up at 7am the next morning. It was raining and it's so hard to get up when it's raining...ARGH...  How I wish I could sleep the whole morning. Boss is on leave today. Time flies in the office cos I had to catch up on work as last Saturday was off day. George W Bush is in Istanbul to launch the Nato meeting today. Agent in Istanbul is close for 2 days. This gives me some space to breathe.   No good news in the job market. Still have not received any calls from prospective employers. Just got to keep on trying.

      Just finished watching Malaysian Idol on tv. This time the crew were in JB after the audition in Kuching last week. Boy I can't believe how bad some of those contestants were. They really got the balls (for guys) or breasts??? (for girls) to go for the audition.  Don't they know how bad they sing? To all those really really bad singers who auditioned in Malaysian Idol in Penang, Kuching and JB....I salute you! Can't wait for next week when they go to KL to find more bad singers to make me laugh next Friday.

      I received a feedback from Kew today telling me the pictures I had put up in my earlier posts are not showing. Yes, I have been trying to figure out how to put them up here and I was pointing the pictures to my long abandoned geocities website which I had the pics uploaded there. Kew is a fellow blogger from Penang and he has set up  urlLink Penang Blogger , a Penang Bloggers portal and currently in Beta Testing.   I received the following email from Kew and when I checked his portal this lousy blog is already linked to it.   ======================= Hi,   I have come upon your site from the Blogger.com Penang State listing.

Tonight England will play Portugal in the 1st Euro 2004 Q-finals. For the past few day, I have been trying to stay awake till 2.30am to watch some of the matches but I always fall asleep around 1am. Too tired from running like a dog in the office. Thank god tomorrow is Friday!

      This is the main entrance to my new apartment. The apartment is expected to be ready in 1 to 2 month's time. It costs me a bomb to purchase this apartment and this will be my new home in time to come... I am impatiently waiting and so looking forward to see how it is when the OC is obtained. It has a swimming pool and a gym. Nice, isn't it?

      I spent the whole day at work entertaining a customer from Dubai and his customer from Iran today. This Dubai guy is okay and he is a happy guy. He placed some orders today and everything went on pretty well in the meeting. Just had dinner with two of them and my boss at Kashmir, the expensive Indian restaurant in Penang Road opposite Cititel. The food is very expensive but it's on ah kong's account so it's ok.   Half way through dinner, P called my boss' handphone to give me some lecture. Damn! It's only Monday and it spoils my whole week! My job motivation is all time low now and I am just looking forward to Saturday. I will leave for Genting and taruh all my frustrations out at the gaming table!

      Shit! I changed the template for the blog and screwed up the layout of the profile. I guess I better stick to this very basic template for now in order not to mess anything up.   I found another picture. It's a cake and no I don't work in Dell.

      I have seen, met and dealt with many types of customers. Some are smart, some not so smart and then you have those really stupid ones. There is this customer which I have been working with for the past 2 years. Let's just call this bird brain P.   The orders given by P is insultingly small for the manufacturing concern which I am attach to. Quite frankly, we have been performing badly in terms of delivery for P not once, not twice but countless times. Giving P sleepless nights have become a norm for us. I am just waiting to see P go screw up another supplier!

      I waxed my car today. I signed up for the priority job application in  urlLink jobstreet . It cost me RM50 and I paid by credit card. Yea, I am kinda looking for a new job as the current one sux.   I stumbled upon some pictures taken during my holiday in London about 3 years ago. This is one of them.

      Today is Saturday and the first match of Euro 2004 will begin in Portugal. I am watching wrestle mania XX vcd loan to me by my colleague. Didn't have the time to watch the vcd until after the exam. I am also in the midst of downloading some new mp3 and to burn an audio cd for my car. I have not washed my car in the past 2~3 weeks. It has been collecting durt and dust so I will give it a thorough bath later today.

      Hooray... Strategic Info Systems exam is finally over. Tough exam and I am only hoping to scrape thru. 40/50 or 50/50 chance I reckon. The objectives questions (difficult) cover 40 out of 150 marks and the balance is all in the case study. I have not got a clue what one of the case study questions is all about. Damn it cost me 10 marks there. Anyway, that was over and I can't do nothing to change it. Just to keep on praying and hope for a pass.   Got back home at 5.45pm and immediately I got online to delete my office emails. I got more 250 mails for being away from office for a mere 2 days.   *Klik*Klik*Klik* and I continue to delete those stupid emails!

      I took today off from work to do my final preparation for exam tomorrow. Went to the General Post Office today to buy 25 pcs of the Star Cross Word puzzle post card and greeted the lady at the counter good morning. It went like this...  Me: Selamat Pagi... Can I have the Star Cross Word Puzzle postcards? Lady at the counter stared at me as if I was cursing her mother, father and entire fwacking family when I greeted her. Lady: Berapa? Me: 25 Lady: 12.50 I paid the money, grabbed the postcards and went off.  I guess it's that time of the month for that post office lady!

      Today is Saturday, the 5th day of June in the year 2004. 3 days to go before my 2nd last paper for my MBA degree. I have not been spending much time in this semester for the upcoming exam. This is probably caused by the stress I get from my work. This time around I am only sitting for one paper - Strategic Info Sys. It covers 8 modules... with lots of theories to memorise.   While I try to do some revision in the very last few days before my exam, I blog alittle to de-stress. The weather is rainy today so I guess it is good for my revision but before I hit the books again let me say a few things about my job....  I have been working in this organisation for a little more than 6 years now. This job has taken me to a few places like Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh, Hong Kong and Shanghai in Asia and Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Friedrichshafen (that's in Germany in the border of Germany, Austria and Switzerland) and Zurich in Europe. Others may think what I do is quite glamorous coz I get to travel a few times a year but the actual job in the office is a real pain in the a$$. The salary I get is not above the industry average. The bosses here are idiots and dickheads who only know how to complain with no leadership qualities whatsoever. That's a very brief overview of my workplace.

      I went to check out my apartment today. The management has started sending letters asking some of the owners to collect the keys. It's good news. Those folks whose bank have released all the housing loan should be able to get the letter soon... including me. I went up to the 10th floor unit 10. Looks okay overall. The pool area is almost completed. The swimming pool itself is average in size - probably about 20 sq metres??? There's even a slide in the pool for kids. Downside is gotta fork out another few thousand bucks before I collect the keys.

      Shit lah! Even though today is Friday but I gotta work the next day! Tomorrow is Saturday and it is also a working day.  It's so unproductive to work on Saturdays.  But what can the salary earner do? We are all treated like slaves. I don't like it but this is top management's way. Even if we get promotion but there is only little change in pay. Top management only knows how to play.  Golf and karaoke girls are their preys. Fuck the management... they are all gays. A new and better job is all I pray.  Okay...enough of whining and complaining. I got some pics that will make you salivate... :p  A handsome serving of "ice kacang???" made in Taipei with sweet strawberries.    A "spiderman" dessert made in New York...    ... Spidey is dead but still smiling    Winter in NY

      My trip to Hong Kong end Aug will set me back by slightly over RM2000. This trip will be for 6 days and 5 nights. I will put up at  urlLink The Royal Plaza Hotel  in Mongkok. I am now confirmed to be flying with  urlLink Cathay Pacific  flight no. CX720 ETD Penang 0750 ETA Chek Lap Kok 1345 with a one hour stopover in KLIA on 31 Aug. The return flight is CX721 ETD HK 1455 ETA Penang 2035.   I have also confirmed my attendance to join a short trip to Haadyai by bus on 14th and 15th Aug. Haha... enjoy lah next month!

      I attended my first lecture for this semester. The class was Finance. As expected, I was drilled and tortured for almost 5 hours from 2.30pm right till 7pm with 2 short breaks in between. Module 1 covers topic such as NPV, IRR, interest rates and bond valuation among others. We will continue with Module 1 tomorrow from 9pm to 5pm. Just the thought of sitting for almost 8 hours in Finance class freaks me out. I am not a fan of Finance. This is probably one of my least favourite subject but I will try to love it and live with it for the next 6 months. After all this is my last paper. I cannot emphasize that more to keep me motivated to complete this course. This will be my last last last paper so I must really hammer the nail right on the head. I vow and promise myself that I must study more for this paper, spend more time to get to know Finance better for she is my friend, not my enemy for the next 6 months. I have doubts I can keep this promise but I will try.  Here is my exam result for Strategic Information System. I sat for this paper with barely one week of studying and amazingly I managed to get an A...

      First things first. The wait is finally over. The exam results are out this morning. Managed to get my Registration no. and Student ID from home to check my result through the net. Wah! I cannot believe I got an A for this paper. I was only hoping for a pass but I guess the examiner must have shit stuck on his/her eyes when marking my paper. In hokkien, it is "buck chew kor sai." This is totally unexpected. I am now thinking whether I should pamper myself with PS 2. Yea, I am a big "kid" and still like playing video games once awhile. One more paper to go and I will be certified by Heriot Watt as Mentally Below Average.  Another surpise came this afternoon about 4-ish when I checked this blog. Sometimes my itchy fingers just wanna klik klik a little bit&nbsp;to push up the number of visitors&nbsp;here.... haha.... pathetic isn't it. Anyway,&nbsp;the surprise was someone actually read&nbsp;my rants here and even leave comments. (See comments in&nbsp;last post). One fellow blogger from Penang by the name of  urlLink Cindy  stopped by - thanks. Naturally, I visited her blog and then stumbled upon  urlLink Terry's  blog. Beware when you enter... you will be "anal"ized by Terry.  Alright so it's friday and it's Malaysian Idol night again. Geez... did you read the write up by Rubin Khoo in The Star today on how bad  urlLink last week's show  was? I was right, wasn't I?  I have also decided that I will be going to spend one weekend in Haadyai next month. Hope no untoward incident will happen.   Damn! how fast time flies when one is so stressed by work. Most of the time I don't even have time to drink some&nbsp;water or go "pang jiu" when I am at my desk.

      I am so tired of my job. Why I complain so much about this job is because I have no control whatsoever that will happen. Murphy's law is at work everyday in my workplace. Have you ever wondered when is the right time to change job? I try so hard to enjoy what I do everyday when I am at the office but I can't seem to find the reason why I should continue to work for this company. Just last week, a staff from another Sales department had resigned. People want a career .... not just a job!

I have been logging in to check my exam results everyday for a couple of times since middle of last week. Day by day I am getting more nervous and anxious. I hope the examiner made a mistake in computing the marks and let me scrap by this paper!

      The presentation of Malaysian Idol last night was awful, horrifying and shocking. Not that the contestants are performing badly but the producers must be sleeping. The set up of the stage was so cheap. What is the difference between Malaysian Idol and the other talent/singing shows produced locally? What were the producers thinking?&nbsp;Oh... I sounded like&nbsp;my boss' boss there. Anyway, there was no live audience. The only audience were the contestants themselves and the 3 judges. Kak G's comments are always the same or as how Paul Moss would put it "no originality". Everytime you will hear Roslan say something like "Bagus! Bagus! Apa pandangan G?" which Fauziah Latiff in turn will say "Kak G setuju, cuma pitching...blek blek blek..." What the fuck? I cannot imagine how these 2 were selected to be the judges. Such low standards and so "siah sui only!"&nbsp;

      For 4 nights in a row from Sunday till yesterday (Wed), I had to attend to guests from Singapore and HCM for dinner. Damn tiring, never been so tired for a long time. Finally all the guests have gone back and I am happy to be left alone until the next guest visit next week. Next week, we will be host to 2 american guys. They are kinda like our competitor but their company is in chapter 11 now. The reason they are visiting is to see the possibility of synergy between the 2 companies. Unfortunately, more dinner and lunch to come.   In the meantime, I have already made my booking to Hong Kong on 31 Aug. Cannot believe I am on the waiting list! A lot more people travelling nowadays!

      Tonight I will be attending to some guests from Vietnam. We will be having dinner at the Ocean Green Restaurant. Original plan was to go to CRC but it is full so we had to change venue. I am feeling lazy to go but it is part of my job. See I even "work" on Sunday evening to host dinner and yet I get a lousy salary from my company. Am I being screwed by the company or what?

      I just finished watching Spiderman II and part I of The Day After Tomorrow. Well, I said part one because I only watched the first vcd. The second vcd cannot be played. Oh well, what can I expect from buying pirated vcds from the streets? Anyway, I bought 3 movie titles on Thursday night. These 2 and the Jackie Chan...Around the world in 80 days or something like that.   It has been a long work week for me. It usually is when my boss is out of town. I got to attend meetings, give reports on his behalf and then report on his behalf in the meetings as well. You know, I got to report with the other senior managers from the other sales department and I am only a nobody - small potato/peanut - in the company. The MD of the company is there, the Deputy MD is there, the Director of Production attends the meeting, the factory managers are all present... basically all the top dogs in the company have to listen to me trying to bull my way through on the monthly report of my department's progress. Heck... I need to learn more 'tai chi' and let my japanese colleague report the next time!  Family is planning a 2d/1n trip to Haadyai (correct spelling?) by bus sometime in Aug next month. Should I go or not?

      Monday blues again today. Lucky offices in USA are closed today due to the replacement holiday yesterday. 4th of July - Independence Day. Hope the rest of the weekdays will pass on peacefully for me.  I got a letter cc to me today from my housing or rather apartment developer. It's music to my ears and I quote from the letter ...  "The said building has been duly constructed and completed in accordance with the relevant Acts, by-laws and regulations and that all conditions imposed by the Appropriate Authority in respect of the issuance of the Certificate of Fitness for Occupation have been duly complied with."  I guess it's gonna be soon when they call me to collect the keys to my new home!

      Went for my routine check up at Tanjung Medical Center this morning at 10:30am although my appointment is at 11:00am. BP was 130/85 slightly on the high side.   After check up, I went to have a look at the progress of my new apartment. They have planted some trees in the compound near the main entrance.

      This morning on the way to work I saw a BMW breakdown in front of PCGHS (that's Penang Chinese Girls' High School). It looked like a 5 or 7 series. They passengers of the car were so embarrassed cos their luxury vehicle dissapointed them. Usually, I dont see luxury cars like Merc, BMW...etc breakdown. I can imagine how they felt when the car died on them right in the middle of a busy street on a nice Saturday morning.   I too had my fair share of problems with my Iswara. In fact, my car would not start twice after my lectures due to some problem with the car battery. Had to push start it once. On the 2nd occasion, it decided to come back to live only after a few serious spanking - literally - on the battery compartment. The last encounter I had with this car/junk was when I was driving home in the evening. Just as I was entering Vale of Tempe heading home the car started to lose power. After 10 seconds, the engine died and I began to smell something burning coming from the engine bay. The burning smell was actually coming through from the air con vent. Opened the trunk and went about checking on the engine to see what went wrong as if I was a pro at fixing cars. After 5 seconds or so (I had no idea what went wrong) jumped in the car and decided to start the car again but with the air con off. Car can start and slowly drove back home. Sent car to mechanic to get air con fixed the next day. Other problems I had with this car so far are  1) Odometer not working 2) Air con not cold 3) Back lights also function as aquarium 4) Door in driver seat cannot close properly   the list goes on...  What can I say for a 37k car which is about 6 years old... or is this the quality of Malaysian cars? My car has travelled over 250,000 km or maybe more cos odometer is fwacked.

      Been buzy with work this week. It's Friday tomorrow but I ain't too happy about it coz Saturday is a working day this week. It is so stupid and unproductive to work on Saturdays especially if it's a half day. My mind would think everyone is still in bed but I got to work in the office at 8.30am! Just when I am getting all warmed up to start working, the clock is already showing half past 12 and before I know it...I'm driving home after doing nothing in the office on a Saturday morning. I can do so many things like sleep, sleep, sleep and more sleep till it's ten or eleven if I don't work on Saturdays.   My boss and another colleague will be travelling for business this weekend. Boss is going to South America - the inaugural business trip to South America. Along the way he will stop over for a day in Columbus to see a customer and the colleague will be flying to Munich and then to NY for a week. As for me, I have not planned any business trip in the near future but I am planning for my holiday to Hong Kong to see my gf in August....wheeee! Now looking around for a cheap package to HK for 6 days and 5 nights. So looking forward to this trip :) The last time I saw her was like 4 months ago...
