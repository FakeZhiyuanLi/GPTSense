      Well it was another crappy night of softball. After playing to near flawless games against 2 of the top teams, my team decided to suck ass. I have no idea what happened but the teams' defense went to the crapper. Mistakes were made everywhere. They only positive was the fact that our offense picked up some.  I had a couple mistakes myself so I am not blaming everyone else. I had one ball go off my glove at first which is an error. Then twice I left runners on base when I was up. I hit the ball where I wanted to each time, but the defence got there before the ball had a chance to drop.  Hopefully tonight we will pull out a win and have a slim chance to make the playoffs. I hope we make it. If not oh well. I luckily found a guy at work that knows of a fall league so hopefully I can get on that.

      Well another softball game down against a good team. We got a win! Very excited about that. That brings our record up to 7-9 with 2 games left. One we should deifnatly win and the last I hope to steal another and end up .500.  Well Wendy finaly start to do some serious batting practice last night. good thing since the season is almost over. that kills me. she did actually do good last night. She made a catch I didn't think she would. She also had a hit that made it over the short stops head.  Our top girl Jess hit a ball that would have been a HR if we were in the Alton field. It was a bomb. It scared the crap out of the other team. I love that girl!  I got roped into umpiring tonight. That ought to be fun. I do it for the elementary kids but this is will pissy adults. Luckily I have friends on both teams and should be a fun game. If not you will hear about it, lol.

      Well we finally won a close softball game against the number one team Saturday. 11-10. It took I think 10 innings. Normally softball is 7. We kept tying the game. Made for a great game. I had close games. Always gets you going, lol. It was a fun time. Nick, Merrie and baby Alex made it, so that was great to have them there to see that. My uncle Ed from NJ was up and made it there as well. It was good game and great to have butts in the stand.  3 more games and the season is over unless we can sneak into the playoffs. that would be great but I am not counting on it yet. we are 6-9. I would like to finish at .500 but we will see.

      Well today started off great. Woken up at 5:30am with a nasty thunderstorm. It was hitting right outside the house. Alarm went of at 6:30am. Well today is my late day at work and the wife has to get up first. She didn't want to get up. She decided to stay home cause she was tired. Well it didn't help she kept us up to after 11 last night. Oh well. Must be nice to be able to just stay home.  Tonight I am helping Nick do the oil changes in his car. That will be fun. Work on 2 vehs that I haven't before. Makes it more interesting at least.  Softball is almost over. 4 games to go unless for some unknown reason we make it to the playoffs. Now that will be wild. I really want to play longer. Guess I will have to find a fall league.

      Well the weekend is over. What can i say, that sucks, lol. It always goes by so quick. Did i get anything i wanted done, lol hell no! I got some stuff the wife wanted though. At least someone is happy. I have to go to a wedding saturday, I am not looking forward to it. I hate to dress up. why can't people get married in casual clothes, or hell non at all if they are good looking. Make my life a lot easier.  I just got a jeep wrangler sport almost 2 weeks ago and it is still muddy. I took it through some big rain puddles and small mud holes. I haven't had a chance to wash it. I got half done friday. My father in law was borrowing my wifes grand cherokee to take our camper, camping for the week. I was running the hose and the wife was washing. Well she stopped halfway and rinsed it off so she could come over and help with the explination on where stuff was in the trailer. Hopefully i will be able to wash it today or tomorrow. I probably won't do it tonight as I have another softball game and tomorrow I will probably take the harley to work.  Oh well.

      Well I got to work today and found out that I have been put in the position to vote on a protested softball game for the league. This kinda puts me in a bad spot. Here is what happened and why this is being protested.  Apparently there was a fly ball to the outfield and a runner at 3rd. The runner waited till the catch was made and then tagged up and started to run. Half way he decided he wasn't going to make it, so he went back to third. The ball was thrown to 3rd, and the runner was called out but the 3rd baseman just tagging the bag. This is a wrong call by the ump.  No this is where it gets tricky. The team in question is with a some what friend that got me in the league this year. She is the coach of that team and I am no the other team from our town. The umpire is the father of a childhood friend. So either way I vote someone will be pissed that I will have to deal with.  Being an umpire myself for little league games I know it isn't easy. Especially if you are by yourself, which this ump was. I feel back cause I know how hard it is to keep track of everything. So I am a little bias going into this, but we will see what happens.

      Ok, I am on a co-ed softball team in my town. I love to play sports and this is the first time since college I have been able to play again at a competitive level. I was a catcher growing up in little league until I realized how political my town was, so I stopped after 6th grade. When I started play co-ed softball my junior year of high school I was coverted to a 1rst baseman. Pretty much for the sole reason that I can't catch a softball in the outfield. Something to do with the flight pattern messes me up. Baseball ok, softball forget it. I played 1 year of that until I hit college. Then I split time at 1rst and catcher. Now 5 years after graduation, my team (I am the coach) decides I should play short stop as I am one of the best athletes on the team. Not bad for a guy that is not in the greatest shape. So cool, I get to play the premier spot after my favorite MLB player, Nomar Garciaparra. Well we started and I sucked. I am getting better so that is good. Hard to move from one side of the field to the other.  Now I don't mind co-ed teams. They can be fun. Well we have one girl Wendy that absolutely sucks and it kills me. She is the nicest person and I like her but man she can't play. She is our catcher mainly cause she can't do anything else. She can't hit, barley can catch and can't throw.  Well last night 2 things happened that killed me. One Jeff our left center fielder who knows the game was on second, no outs. The ball is hit to the first baseman. What does Jeff do, stand there at second. I was mad. Ball hit to that side you go. Well next batter hits it to the short stop. Jeff decides to run with the ball right in front of him. WHAT THAT HELL!!!! Smart play by the short stop gets him in a run down and is tagged out. I asked, since I am the coach, did you forget what side the ball was hit on? He gets pissed at me. Excuse me for knowing the game, bone head. That shit drives me nuts. Secondly we are down by one runner on first, two outs bottom of the seventh (7 inning games). Who comes up, Wendy! Everyone on the team started packing the gear. Talk about a let down. Here we are battling back and poor Wendy strikes out. Kills me! What is worse she threw the bat. I wanted to smack her. Talk about making us look like assholes.  There was a lot more that went on during that game that pissed me off. I will probably add more later.

      Hi there everyone,  I am new to this blogging thing. After almost a year of reading my friend Nick's I figured I would get off my butt and do one. Why not, I have stuff to rant, theorize and what not in my head as well. So I joined up. Hope you like what is you see, if not oh well I don't really much care, LOL. As you can see I am a bit of a smart ass so be prepared.
