      In the first paragraph of the G-8 post, there was supposed to be a link on the word 'fools' which ends the sentence.  That link never happened, so just ignore the sentence.

      I wish this was the start of some funny pervert joke, but this is Time Magazine quoting a guest of President Bush in reference to  urlLink Bush's personal spoil  of the illegal Iraq war, Saddam Hussein's unloaded pistol.  I sleep comfortably at night knowing that with no clear exit strategy and that the rest of the world has very few good things to say about the U.S., that our Commander in Thief gets to play with a captured enemy firearm and show it to visitors.  How very presidential of him.  Well, at least it's not in  urlLink Saddam's  hands anymore (talk about someone who was able to shave but not get a cup of coffee).  I am happy that the gun is unloaded.  Primarily, because I simply don't trust the current administration with anything approaching an operational weapon.  While I wish this was an isolated case, it does seem indicative of the right wing's collective fascination with violence (unfortunately shared by many on the left as well).  A president playing with an unloaded pistol of the enemy is not something I look for in an electable candidate.  I have to wonder if Bush has a more pronounced than usual smirk on his face when he shows the gun to people.  I wonder if he lets his guests touch the pistol and how he handles it around them.  Does he prostrate himself somewhat and hand the gun out with the handle pointing at the guests, or does he assume the mantle of power and authority by showing off the gun barrel first, forcing the guests to politely look done the menacing yet functionally impotent barrel made of Soviet steel (or it could be  urlLink American  for that matter).  Or does Bush assume a neutral position, handling the gun with the barrel pointed in a sideways direction?  Does Bush handle and play with the gun when no one else is around, does he fantasize about shooting someone with it, and if so, whom?  Does Bush point it at objects in the Oval Office or any of the portraits, and if so, what objects and portraits?  Does Bush ever show it to guests while making jokes about Iraq or about the impotence of Saddam (the gun was unloaded)?  Does Bush ever point it at a subordinate when angrily lecturing, or rest his hand on it when plotting policy, ever point it in anger, or point it at himself?  While these questions are most likely meaningless and quite imflammatory otherwise, if answered, such questions would reveal more about the current administration than all the current scandals, invocations of God, and the disregard for the rule of law and our Bill of Rights combined.  While I am against many forms of gun control and believe the Second Amendment does give the right to Americans to own, maintain, and operate firearms - such questions as these and the way people seem to play with weaponry or models of weaponry and how such objects are used to convey power is enough to make me never want to own or touch a gun in my life.  I know that such an attitude of mine may be fallacious and that such relationships between guns and power are social constructs, but I'd be happier knowing that the most telling object legacy about our president would not be a gun, but rather an imported cigar.    I do miss the days of sex scandals and the Republican Operatives looking on in awe as Clinton explains the mechanics of giving and receiving good oral sex.    That aside, I wonder if Bush has shown it to Charlton Heston and if Charlton has made any more dumb racist remarks?  Sure, I support the second amendment, but only if it means that other people besides criminals and NRA-members can protect themselves.

      The final lines to "The Day After Tomorrow".  I just got back from one of the local cinemas with decidedly mixed feelings about the movie.    Yes, I have ruined the final dialogue (big deal, like disaster movie script can really be spoiled) and the final shot is one of a very clear computer animated photo of an Earth iced over from about 35 deg N as you the viewer pans out into space, the Earth practically blends into the ubiquitous Environmental Defense Fund picture of Earth (the one seen on bumper stickers and the mail and pamphlets that always ask for money).  It's so nice that billions die so one astronaut can make his little quip about how the worst storm (both in billions of fictitious lives lost and in terms of violations of the laws of physics) has cleansed the Earth of air pollution.  Also there's all the dialogue about how in exchange for refugee status, the expatriate states of America forgave all of third world debt.  Also there's the winner about how accommodating and nice the third world is about a bunch of 1st worlders now living for the next 1,000 years or so in their midst.    Now for the reality check, and I don't mean how this film throws the Ideal Gas Law out the window.    Supposing (chuckle) such a catastrophe could happen, the third world would not care if their debt was relieved or not.  Who cares, the creditors are all frozen, and if they survived, they have to live among the debtors now.  Also, if it did become a scuffle, remember that the last military recourse of the creditors is frozen stiff in some silo in North Dakota or Siberia.  Furthermore, if such a disaster could take place, let's remember that a depopulation by half or two-thirds (since most humans live in the Northern Hemisphere) that such ideas like debt, mechanized war, communism, capitalism, and the nation-state with its national borders may cease to exist.  All are examples of social structure and were created by and for humans, mostly as means by which humans fight over temporally and spatially limited resources (since there is a possibility of there existing unlimited resources in the universe).  Thus most ideas such as debt and economics as well as conflicts are coevolutionary responses to our conflicts over resources, which are also conflicts over discourse and meaning.  A post-disaster society would most likely create new social structures and social norms which would control access and security of resources (also the society which maintained access and security would then be in the best position to spread its ideology and vice versa as an attractive ideology can be useful for winning over the human capital necessary to access, secure, and develop the resources (natural and critical natural capital).  Hence the feedback between meaning and resources sets up the coevolutionary relationship, which is then coevolutionary with other variables (like climate for example).  For more and much more scholarly information on the linkages between economics, the physical universe, conflict, and resources - check out this  urlLink journal .  The other queasy feeling I left the theatre with was also the final scene, the one with the very clean but cold Earth was the message that seemed to say that it will require a grand and total disaster to save the Earth (and ourselves being implied) from the nastier aspects of our human existence, after which of course everything will be nice.  Even meteorologically, this somewhat silly utopian metaphor works, for after a cold front moves through (with it attendant thunderstorms, rain, and occassional  urlLink natural special affects ) the post-rain air always feels so Canada-fresh and clean and the sunlight pokes through on landscapes so beyond the possibility of rendering by computer graphics that we might notice how beautiful normalcy is if we bothered to look out the damn window more often.  In the meantime we sit in darkened theatres watching special effects of a storm that could never occur while all too slowly destroying much of what we take for granted, not out of malice as some would assert, but out of ignorance as we all are in some part.  In the meantime, get away from the telescreen and spend more time outside, you'll learn to appreciate your environment that way more than any bad movie, pamphlet, or protest message would.  Also, time spent outdoors is  urlLink healthy  as well.  As for using less fossil fuels and not contributing to global warming, here's one of the latest unique  urlLink ideas .  As for the more mundane variety, even our  urlLink leading presidential candidates  for 2004 are giving it a try.  Well, that's all for now, I'll probably have more stuff to say very soon about the G-8, protests against, and my own part of it.

      Thanks to some feedback from a friend, I would like to clarify something in the first post.  Number 4, I drink, Happy Hour is at 283 every Friday from 5 until 8, and I am usually there at that time.  283 is a bar in Athens located at 283 E. Broad Street.  The  urlLink cheap beer  is one dollar during Happy Hour.

      Ok, it's a weak title, but poignantly and unfortunately true.  The latest news is that  urlLink four more American soldiers  have died in Afghanistan, part of a poorly planned war in pursuance of a  urlLink grand and despotic vision .  Read up my blogger buddies!  I'll have more to say about this later.  In the meantime, www.antiwar.com is the place for news and www.unitedforpeace.org is a good place to go for action.  The antiwar.com site is also a good place as well to find action items, just check their links.  Also check out Raimondo's column, the leading 'conservative' antiwar voice on the site.    As for why I am opposed to war and means of conflict resolution which involve force and/or fraud, this is  urlLink why .

      I've been getting ready for the G-8 ministerial at Sea Island, Georgia.  I am going there to protest.  Now before we all get on our "goddam smelly hippies" hypocritical moral high-horses, maybe you should continue reading.  Besides, you don't want to be like these fools.  The G-8, short for the  urlLink Group of 8 , is basically the meeting of the heads of state of the eight most powerful nations on Earth.  They frequently discuss policies behind closed doors and out of reach of the free press.  These policies are often the sort of policies we do not want to become law and are friendly to big business in a way which often tramples on our civil rights and liberties, worker's protections, environmental protections, and further centralize power - effectively weakening representative democracy.    For more information on supporting democracy, click  urlLink here .  Hence such ministerials are not well liked by many of the citizens of these eight nations, and protests - sometimes facing violent state repression, have occurred in the past.        Regardless of what precedent the past has set, I will be  urlLink protesting  at this one, going with a group of likeminded liberal/left folks from Athens.  Currently a friend of mine is working on making and posting general interest fliers which will later be around downtown.  I've been helping him make and put them up as well.  We will later form an affinity group in order to show a unity of local activists at Brunswick and Savannah.  Affinity groups are groups which have these things in common:  a homogeneity of political interests, of agenda, and of agency (what threat level of arrest or injury they are willing to tolerate - critical when fighting the nation-state).  If you are interested in going, there is a  urlLink rideboard  and there is also a schedule (see g8carnival site) so we can all coordinate dodging tear gas with research and drinking cheap beer.    Oh, and Sonny Purdue, governor of Georgia, issued a  urlLink State of Emergency  order that gives him and law enforcement the ability to shut down protests.  For more protest information, check out www.indymedia.org.  As more information on my own personal experience with the Fair World Fair and resistance to the G-8 becomes available, I will post the stories here.   In the unrelated news column, a silviculture corporation out in California and Oregon has racked up  urlLink 325 violations of the law .  Now I'm no big fan of federal regulation or of the national government, but we all did pay to have certain forest areas and environmental neccessities protected, so Maxxam/PL has been a bad corporate citizen.  If you want to help in the fight against Maxxam/PL, check out what some  urlLink folks  in Northern California are doing.

      Alright, the big experiment with my own blog.  A blog is sort of like a drug with all the peer pressure and all, and with all the internet roadkill and 'e or be eaten' crap, I thought it would be a good idea to do my own blog and use it as a bit of e-toilet paper with my rants on it.  I hope you enjoy, but I expect to have a lot of you hate me if I do a good job.  Oh well...     Personally, I've had a glut of extra time on my hands lately, so this blog should suffice and it will serve as a good pulpit for my beliefs and political ideas.  I am an anarchist.  As to what sort of anarchist, I fall about right down the middle of the road between the lefty black bloc "the bank is bunk" sort of socialist leaning anarchists and the we love Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman "anarcho-capitalist" sort of anarchists.  Now, since most of you are probably already snoring at this point, just keep in mind that I am a harsh critic of both capitalist and communist systems and I loathe the right wing and authoritarian viewpoints.  Oh, and I really despise W.  What do I do with my life?  1) I research.  I am a graduate student of geography at UGA.  My current topic is the FL/GA/AL water wars and how such a resource conflict means big trouble for Atlanta in the near future (stay tuned).  2) I am an activist.  I am on or soon will be on all of the local listserves from the libertarian party to the revolutionary communist youth brigades.  I'm essentially attracted to all ideas that are liberal/left, but do not necessarily support one idea or creed over any other (more on this in the future).  I strive for synthesis between various ideas to create better alternatives to the current social and power structures.  I campaign, debate, protest, flier, put on shows, rant, street theatre, etc.  I try do the most possible.  3) I sleep.  No seriously, what do you think I have time left to do after 1 and 2?  4) I drink.  Most Friday evenings at 283 where there is from 530 to 730 pm.  5) Occassionally I have a normal social life, but then, normal has a  very  relative meaning.   What do I hope to do with this blog?  Dunno.  Who are you?  If you have read this far - get away from your computer, I'll see you in the streets!

      This past G-8 protest was a miserable failure.  If one's route was the radical and tactic of taking out corporate America via direct action (both vandal and non-vandal) - there was more then enough security forces and legislation around to stop that with any force necessary.  If anyone wanted the other route of pacifistic nonviolent civil-disobedience, expect to be harrassed and arrested, followed by a thorough drubbing at the hands of the state.  Expect to be poorer and skinnier afterwards as well.  If one wanted to have a permit protest, than one was somewhere between horribly limited in their course of action and being just plain shit out of luck in terms of being safe to exercise dissent and be heard by those one is trying to reach.  Oh, and one would be harrassed and possibly arrested anyway.  We need new tactics or we are going to lose in future actions which will greatly impede our chances of winning the culture wars against the conservative right.  At any rate, this is a rough idea of what we are up against  urlLink in terms of opposition .  The old direct action paradigm is dead.    Many activists it seems have been coming to this conclusion and skipped the G-8 to work more on local organizing and raising awareness.  The anarchists should follow suit.  I'll offer a few suggestions. 1)  Avoid arrests unless it can really make a huge impact.  Jail solidarity works when hundreds instead of ten are doing it.  Also this will gather massive media attention.  Often the police simply detain and then release everyone afterwards if this is the case to avoid the massive pile of problems that would result from keeping and charging the protestors. 2) Fuck summits.  The feds have our strategy nailed on this.  We should protest elsewhere and not let them know beforehand.  No permits.  To make the no permits thing work, we cannot do anything destructive of other's stuff.  Any destruction of property should not occur within or along any protest which involves nonviolence.  Keep actions separate.   3) Discipline.  No, I'm not asking anyone to be the stereotypical Sunday Best, but we could learn a few things from the what the Falun Gong did at Brunswick (and without any permits too).  Silence can very powerful in these cases, particularly if combined with good imagery.  I'm rarely a fan of discipline or structure, but a structure that can be agreed upon in consensus could be useful.  All I'm asking is that we learn how to incorporate disciplined movement, imagery, and sound into our repertoire of tactics.   4) Local organizing.  We need to do more outreach and person to person contact even if it means we can't do a loud rallies or marches.  We need to build more networks, heterarchies, social capital, etc along the lines of decentralization and democratization.  The actual loud street actions are a part of our repertoire and are a tool, not an end goal. 5) I'll give more ideas in time to come.  Yes, it won't be easy, but I don't think I need to provide anymore links to stories about what could happen if the right wing authoritarians keep remaking Earth in their image.

      This is part one, when I have more energy, I will include more.     To wrap up, I was at the anti-CocaCola convergence and marched in the antiwar march and environmental justice march, including the pseudolegal breakaway march.  I was not at the Palestinian Justice (or whatever the hell the organizers called it, the issue was stolen by the anarchists who were arrested).  In Savannah, I marched with the black bloc and then met up with some friends of mine from Tallahassee and had dinner with them.  Talk about going from revolutionary to bourgeois in under an hour!  The police and military presence never let up, but I was still able to have a lot of fun and learn a lot of new things about political activism.  I'd tell more, but I am in urgent need of sleep so I will have more information soon.  If you want more information now, feel free to check out www.indymedia.org.  For those of you who want to get involved and help some good people out, go to the http://atlanta.indymedia.org and call the numbers of the Glynn County magistrates, solicitors, and councilmembers to demand release of the prisoners on their own recognizance and that all charges be dropped.  5 of the 17 have already been released, but we need to keep up the pressure.    Kudos to all those who call.

      (I'll apologize in advance if this is rushed, and has horrible grammar and spelling.  I am very busy and working on little sleep and the indymedia space is very hectic.  I could really use a shower as well.)  There's so many damn cops here it feels like a bad sequel to a bad Sly Stallone movie.  Well, actually it feels worse, much worse.  There are police from all over Georgia and about every fifteenth car on the road is some police, fed, or military vehicle.  In case anyone is interested, I am blogging from the nominally safe indymedia convergence center here, which is sheltered in a local church.  The feds already know we are here and also at our community college location.  I will now detail a full list of this extralegal and unconstitutional harrassment that has occurred so far on American soil (any of you fed son of bitches know what Posse Committatus is?)  I have seen cops from Glynn-Brunswick, Chatham-Savannah, Valdosta, Kennesaw, Eatonton, Athens-Clarke, Cobb, Fulton, Gwinnet, MARTA (Atlanta's mass transit), Dept Natural Resources, Forest Resources, Conyers, Marietta, Rome, Augusta-Richmond, all matter of emergency medical, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, Dept Homeland Security, Georgia Highway Patrol, and the Dept of Motor Vehicles.  National Guard have been mobilized from as far as Iowa and elsewhere around the nation and I have seen tanks, jeeps, MASH units and ambulances, canvas sided trucks, armored personnel carriers, patriot missile launchers, Navy SEALS in the inflatable Zodiacs, coast guard cutters and naval patrol craft, anti-submarine naval helicopters (flying barely 100 meters above crowded neighborhoods while packing enough firepower to level the island), and the ubiquitous Hueys.  So far I've managed to avoid seeing any main battle tanks.  The military units also have patroled and harrassed the activists as well, including the occassions of Hum-vee espionage on our centers, espionage conducted with units equiped with m-240 or M-16/M-60? machine guns.    No arrests yet, but a lot of harrassment.  Before going further, realize that this blog and my email may be being tapped (as well as my cell phone calls).  Within coastal Georgia, the Constitution and Bill of Rights might as well mean nothing, this is what the police state looks like.  I am not protesting because I feel safe or empowered, I am doing it because it is the only right strategy to safety and empowerment in the future, to oppose what many here feel as a prequel to a nationwide police state.  Our issues regarding the G-8 in many ways have been subsumed in all of the healthy paranoia and security needs, and we are in many cases more concerned with being heard and protecting our rights guaranteed by the cornerstone documents of the American Republic.  At least half of us have street medic and legal training, so we are somewhat prepared for what is also felt to be the inevitable raids, mass arrests, or physical harrassment.  And the other forms of intimidation have begun already.  Most incidents involve the checkpoint to St Simons Island, much to the dismay of hardy vactioners and some of us protestors playing tourist who have been harrassed and searched by a checkpoint manned by a hundred security personnel fitting the various listings above.    Hum-vees visited the church on Saturday and Sunday and a police car drives past every 15-20 minutes.  When we have a full parking lot or are showing movies outside, the car turns into a caravan of two or more patrol cruisers, an detainee van, and a Hum-vee as well.    The Hum-vee also surveyed the Fair World Fair convergence center at the community college as well.    The Sunday morning visit of the Hum-vee to the church was very disturbing.  It visited during the middle of the service and one soldier decided to go in to mass, despite being late.  The whole time the Hum-vee and two other soldiers remained outside, keeping the gunnery seat and mount pointed at the church the entire time.  The pictures aren't clear, but there are reports that the mount did have the rifle in place.  This happened during the church service and when we went to take a picture of the rifle in the mount on the Hum-vee, and the Hum-vee sped off down the street, wishing to avoid our efforts to document threats to our safety from those who are supposed to by law and by our taxes be protecting us.    The same happened at the community college while I was outside helping a friend with an alligator protest prop and talking on my cell phone.  The gun (I'm not sure if it was there or not) or some listening device was trained on us for at least 30-45 minutes.  Also, the G8 fix shit up urban renewal volunteers were blocked from doing there work originally by local cops who later relented when appropriate permits were shown.  Such was futile anyway as plainclothes Homeland Security/FBI later spied and interfered with the project, overturning the decision of the local police (who feel beytrayed and are pissed as hell at the feds - so much for the Iraqi and Gaza model being employed on U.S. soil).  I have to sign off and run over to a press conference and a flyering action.  I suppose it is likely I will face harrassment, but that should be the extent of it.  Remember, this is our state, not the goddamn police state!  Don't give up the street!

      I believe I should start this post by thanking the Chinese students and activists, many of who died, who tried and are still quietly trying to make the world's largest geopolitical unit into a state with a democractic government.  Thank you, the world will never forget.  Hopefully in another fifteen years real democracy will come to China.    A free market is not enough, what is needed is a free people.  Otherwise the market will only be 'free', and will more resemble some form of corporatist (Musollini fascistic) state.  Such a form of statism passed off as capitalism is not acceptable, and will eventually fail.  And with that, I will now turn my attention to an area closer to home.    Though lightyears ahead of China, the United States and the Western European countries still have major steps to take in reaching the goals of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.  Even though I believe that such goals are unreachable in the pure and abstract form, we can clearly do better and it is our responsibility to always be experimenting with ways to do so.  Mostly these experiments are simple and very individual in scale, such as choosing to vote or not to vote or even boycott an election, how we locomote from place to place and what energy conversions we use to pursue the goal of mobility, choosing what products we buy and were we buy them, and choosing what books we read and what works we write.  These little day to day actions are the bedrock of any real participatory government and economy.    And such is why I will be making a lot of noise at the G-8 conferences.  The first reason for protests are over the policies that the member governments have enacted.  I plan to protest Bush and Blair mostly, but I also have issues with Chirac and Putin as well.  If I am able to make and display placards or participate in actions addressing those issues, I will tell you more on this blog in the near future.  The second reason is over the nebulous reason of global justice and to host our own much more informal conferences to talk about ecocentric modes of economic practice, transportation, and housing while the delegates (behind closed doors and in secrecy that would make a Skull and Bones member green with envy) discuss new ways to pump and burn petroleum, blow up mountains, get richer, and maybe about how they can blow up other parts of the world and each other.  While the last part of the sentence is very sarcastic, they will be talking about issues of resource extraction, economic policy, and foreign policy that will affect our lives greatly.  So to recap, the global justice issue is that these heads of state who arbitrarily call their nations the eight most powerful (what about China, India, Pakistan, Israel, Brazil, or South Africa) are making decision that out of both ignorance or malice could affect my life and those I care about in very negative ways, thus I am demanding that my voice and the voices of other people are heard in this decision making process.    Now, democracy is really quite complicated and requires much preparation and participation.  The fundraising aspect is quite important and the show at the 40 Watt was good.  I got bored and left early; however, as I was temporarily feeling antisocial.  By any indication, it was moderately successful and that's fine by me.  The main point was to raise awareness and make a buck anyway.    The next part now is to get down to Brunswick and find a place to stay.  Right now that seems to be going rather well, but I'll probably be leaving Athens Saturday instead of later tonight.  Again, no problems, as getting there too early might result in unecessary boredom that would better be dealt with by the triple application of research, blogging, and video games (I have no life).  At any rate, it would be nice to be there by Sunday morning, which is the first day that festivities and politics will begin to entertwine in earnest and make life interesting.    For more information on what is going down, check out www.g8carnival.org and www.indymedia.org.  Both website have links to reliable schedules as well as a ton of articles and information about the protests and the stories about preparations (both ours and the state) thus far.  Be skeptical on indymedia, for indymedia is an largely unregulated open posting place for any article, commentary, or notice.    Oh, and while I'm out of town, expect a much less posting volume than usual.

      ...Here's to hoping the American Republic is still a feasible option.  I will start this post with two links, one a comment by a neoliberal on Iraq (quoted and commented on by Nebojsa Malic, part of the crew at antiwar.com) and another by the economist Jim Jubak on the 'cheap money' and consumer debt bubble.  For Iraq and why American power is limited, click  urlLink here   For the commentary from Jubak's journal on MSN Money, click  urlLink here .  To fully grasp the importance of the commentary, put it in light of the partisan wrangling over economic issues and our willingness and security in foreign intervention if we are uncertain about our economic and financial well-being back home.  Soldiers, particularly more so in our volunteer military, have families and sending hundreds of thousands abroad to occupy or die is going to leave one hell of a hole in our economy.    Both at first should seem foreboding with their predictions of an unstable economic future (when we have to play the austerity game the rest of the world knows all too well) and loss of power to intervene according the neoliberal and neoconservative models(no sending in troops every time we need to gas up our SUV's or because the Serbs and Albanians are torching each other again).  I guess it could be somewhat sad that the twin mutually reinforcing myths of unbreachable fortress America and the "my country, right or wrong" have been throuroughly disproven, but this wouldn't be the first time in our history that this has come about.  Furthermore, to keep maintaining these myths would require policies which would be anathema to the Constitution and would in the long run literally turn America into a fortress, and that would not be pleasant at all.  In short, telling ourselves myths and stories can be beneficial, but untenable in the long run and should be avoided on the practical policy level.    The lesson we can learn here is that we cannot inevitably keep growing, intervening, and deciding the fate of Earth.  The combination of all human agency and our structures interacting with the physical universe is only powerful enough to decide that, and as individuals, tribes, or nations, we are largely powerless and given our human history, that is probably a good thing for us and the Earth.  We could go further and enact the policies necessary to keep on doing so, but it would not take long for the pounding of jackboots to crush our dreams and even the jackboot solutions eventually fail and always have.  One cannot ignore the problem of limits or try to smash them, as we can attest to the failures of Rome, Persia, Egypt, the Caliphates, Napoleonic France, Britain, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Empire.  Theoretically, the policies designed under neoliberalism/conservatism could be indefinitely victorious, but theories are poor models for the real world of which we still have a very limited grasp.  Basing our empire on the idea of expanding 'democracy' and neoclassical economics and unlimited growth (expanding markets) is problematic and the results of it are more often than not include murder, torture, massive collateral damage to material structures, degradation of resources critical to human survival, and the collapse of our liberties, security, and well-being at home.  Empire, and other large centralized power structures, are simply not tenable solutions for human social organization.  The nation-state needs to be replaced with a new mode of public organization, until then, our economic problems will likely continue, regardless of what economic system we choose or is chosen for us.  Now, this post should not be taken as an embrace of Marxist economics or of Malthusian collapse.  However, our capacity for free markets and growth is only as large as our ability to access resources critical for 1) human survival (fresh water), 2) technological modality of our economy (petroleum), and 3) societal modality (easy transfer of information - internet - gold, semiconductors, metal ores, petroleum, etc).  Since we are yet to divine the boundaries of our universe, these resources could theoretically be infinite in supply, but our access to them is limited, and our own consumptive need (need being subjective to our physical and social existence) security even more limited then access (since some have more access than other for many reasons - this inequality being the conflict which has generated the environmental justice movement offshoot of the civil rights movement).  Thus while our access will continue to grow and eventually draw from other places besides Earth and new technologies will allow replacement of some resources, where there are major points of change, some will gain access, others will not.  No economic/political system yet devised can give equity, and those that have tried have usually resulted in loss of access and greater inequality.    A long run objective of any liberal/left movement that does not want to fail needs to include the drastic weakening of the executive branch.  While such weakening would make it difficult to enforce any new policies, it would also weaken the ability of the state to use violence against opposition.  Power would devolve to the local level and while such would allow many right wing organizations to gain power locally and enforce their nationalist or fundamentalist utopias, they would lack the power and means to enforce their ideas nationally or internationally.  Thus, competition would be more between ideas instead of whom has military or financial superiority.  Likewise, I am betting that our ideas, those of the liberal/left which are founded on the ideals of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness will win in the contest of ideas.

      I will be going down to Southeast Georgia late Friday afternoon and probably staying there for most of the week.  In the meantime there is a show, being put on by The Department of Homeland Entertainment which is the local send-off for the Fair World Fair.  For me the show will mainly be tabeling and signing up people who want to go the G-8 to arrange carpooling and places to stay.  Right now we aren't very well mobilized, but a few people are going, and either way, my ride down is pretty much set.  For those interested, the show is at the 40 Watt tomorrow and doors open at 5pm, although things should really get rolling at around 930 or so.   Hopefully everything will work out and everyone who wants to go will be able to find a way down there and back.  For now though, I am not entirely optimistic, for the organization is really lacking at this point.  At any rate, when I get back on the eleventh, I will need to get back to researching and getting a Master's proposal together instead of dawdling around like I've been doing lately.
