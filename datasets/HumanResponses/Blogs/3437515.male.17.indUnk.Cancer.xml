      The following question was supposedly given on a chemistry exam, ‘Is hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with proof.’  Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.  One student, however, wrote the following:  ‘First we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.  ‘As for how many souls are entering hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell.  ‘With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for temperature and the pressure in hell to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:  1.If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.  2.Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.  ‘So which is it?  ‘If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms Therese Banyan during my freshman year, that “it will be a cold night in hell before I sleep with you”, and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in that area, then (2) cannot be true, and so hell is exothermic.’  This student got the only A.

      A man goes skydiving for the first time. After listening to the instructor for what seems like days, he is ready to go. Exited, he jumps out of the aeroplane. After a bit, he pulls the ripcord.  Nothing happens.  He tries again.  Still nothing.  He starts to panic, but remembers his back-up chute. He pulls that cord.  Nothing happens.  He frantically begins pulling both cords, but to no avail. Suddenly, he looks down and he can't believe his eyes. Another man is in the air with him, but this guy is going up!  Just as the other guy passes by, the skydiver - by this time scared out of his wits - yells, 'Hey, do you know anything about skydiving?'  The other guy yells back, 'No! Do you know anything about gas stoves?

      I'm bored out of my brain! I've been using this new 'Blog This!' and it works, but for some reason my profile has not been counting my posts and stuff. Does anyone have the same problem or knows what is going on?

      I have started redesigning my website, MCS (My Cool Site), and decided to make a new start with my blog as well.  The next upgrade of MCS is something new. The only thing that I might keep is the color scheme and, so far, the only name of the upgrade I can give you is 'Project Yoru'. To give the biggest hint, 'yoru' is japanese for 'night' and MCS is getting a little darker.
