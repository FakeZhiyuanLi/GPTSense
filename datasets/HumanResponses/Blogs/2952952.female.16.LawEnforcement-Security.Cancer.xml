      I am sorry to say that Mr.Hobo did not get the job at Hobos HEaling Hurts. They told him that any Hobo that is wealthy enough to have a pillow, not to mention a high qualty one such as the one Mr.Hobo has, is not as desperate as some of the hobos out there. They told him they would rather give the job to another hobo with more experience and financial need. They did say however that Hungry Hobos might have a job for him holding a sign on the freeway.Mr.Hobo. then mosyed on over to the Hungry Hobos company building/trashcan and talked to the manager there He said that they could not hire another Employee for that department because they were running out of cardboard and could not hire him for lack of finances. Mr.Hobo then told them that he slept near a recycle bin full of glass that they may be able to use instead of cardboard. But the Manager of Hungry Hobos said, "then the appearence of the hobos would not look as pitifull."  The manager then exclaimed that they were having some trouble with the Hungry Hobos and had to fire a few hobos for wearing clothing that was not appropriate for a hobo  to wear. Nice ties and suits for example. He explained to Mr.Hobo that he hires hobos called Hobo Hunters that scooter around on a broken scooter and report hobos that are wearing nice clothing while on the job. If a hobo is wearing nice clothing on the job then the Hobo Hunters follow him for a few days to be sure that this is a real Hobo and makes sure they have not been lied to by a civilian in hobos surroundings. Or as he put it "wolf in sheeps clothing." Mr.Hobo then said he would like to be a Hobo Hunter. The manager told Mr.Hobo that he needed to find an old looking scooter to use at work. They do not provide company scooters.

      Mr.Hobo has been doing his spring cleaning. He has washed his pillow (an old moter which he has had with him for 32 years now) and has packed away his blanket saying, "When the weather is this lovely I choose to be natural and not covered up, letting my skin feal the breeze." Of course we did not question further to see just how much skin he lets feal the breeze, So we hurridly changed the topic asking if he was going to try and find a job this  summer. He says, " I think that may be the best plan of action for me. I am being interviewed this week for a job at Hobos Healing Hurts. This is an organization in which Hobos like me come from all over the world to help other hobos and help them deal with their pain." (We thought this was a grand plan of action for Mr.Hobo.) We then encouraged him and told him he would be great at the job and told him we would be a reference for him if he needed one.

      Mr.Hobo, (the churches homeless man, that was put under the care of the adventure team) Has been living by the church for quite some time. Although he has often been offered a room and bed, He prefers to be "out in the wild." According to an exlusive interview Mr.Hobo says, "I am gratefull to these wonderfull adventure girls. They have given me love and often stop by to check up on me. They have donated, many times, food to help me during my rough times. I am in debted to these wonderful people and i know they have many other things they could be doing but have decided to help those in need and shelter the world from evil. So once again I say, Thank you adventure girls!"           -Over and out-

      There has been a revolt in the town! It is being led by no other than our Mr. Hobo himself. He was secretly arranging it and corresponding with outside Hobo's when he was in prison. The hObos of Austin have revolted, they broke into the jail that Mr. Hobo was in and set him free. He is now leading many other revolts in he town. He has has gathered the hobos and is now, at this very moment, leading them toward the capital to demand justice for his fellow hobos.  They are fighting for freedom from suspicion that the police officers have so often charged them with. They are merely human, and should not have to pay for what other nobos or hobos have done just because they look guilty. They are saying that they would have no reason to commit felony. They do not steal things, if they did they would break the law of the hobo. They get everything that they own out of the trash of the good people in this city. They have taken nothing. They have no reason to steal anything, for if they did they would posses something that is owned by another and be shunned from Hoboness forever. And once you are a hobo you realize that there is nothing better than to remain a hobo for the rest of your life. So with justice in mind Mr. Hobo is bravely fighting for equality amongst humans, hobo and nobo alike.

      We have now located Mr. HObo. We had heard that he had escaped the jail that he was currently in and ran into the nearby woods and vanished. He has communicated with his comrades, The Adventure Girls, And they are also joining in this mission with him. The mission is still top secret but we will report things as they happen or as soon as we find out. Thank you for your time. This is HoboReporting Over and out.
