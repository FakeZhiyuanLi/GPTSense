      Aha! I knew it!! Language is what makes us humans (domesticated primates) different from all the rest of the critters on this planet, and it looks like these guys are starting to show that our individual language patterns are crucial in defining our culture and attitudes. Okay, maybe they don't go quite that far, but it is a cool study that makes you wonder what language to learn next.  Actually I remember listening to a talk a long time ago and far far away, and the speaker showed PET brain scans of a brain reading western linear script (alphanumeric stuff like you are reading now). Certain predictable and not predictable parts of the brain began to light up. Then, he showed the same person reading Mandarin Chinese with its somewhat non-linear ideograms, and the same portions lit up as before, but with many more places lit up as well. I am no expert on this, obviously, but the idea is quite intriguing.      urlLink Link  to New Scientist article. Image courtesy  urlLink manipulator.com .

      I don't know what to make of this story yet, but it is certainly believable enough.  I wonder if the major networks will run this story.  Don't bet on it.      urlLink  Link    to CHB article, thanks to   urlLink  krivenko.blogspot.com

      This little bit of advertising genius took me way too long to catch onto, but once you feel the idea sink in (ahem), you will be laughing on the floor... or blushing... or inspired to explore a whole new level of fun.
