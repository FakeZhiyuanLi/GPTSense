      Wouldn't it be cool if there was a barbie that you could wax. She'd grow hair like everywhere and you'd have a waxing kit and you could wax her legs and give her a brazillian....I reckon that would be choice....I want one.  Bunny Custard

      At the Cairns Show they have showbags right. They have Barbie, Spiderman, The Simpsons, every single one you could imagine....but why don't they have a fucking "Erotic" showbag. I don't want fucking chocolate and stuffed animal toys. I want handcuffs, whips and body oil. I was very disapointed that I didn't get the showbag I wanted and I think that the showbag elves should be burned to death if they don't make an erotic showbag for next year.

      I was at the Cairns Show yesterday and I saw a clown walking along and then he tripped over. It was the funniest thing I have ever seen.  Bunny Custard

      My school is holding a fashion parade and they have beachwear, daywear, formalwear, sleepwear....but what about the fucking erotic section? I'm serious, what is the fucking point of having a fashion parade if you aren't going to display all kinds of clothing. I wanna wear the crotchless undies and cupless bra, so everyone can see my huge nipples.   Thoughts?   Bunny Custard

      I'm not talking about sex this time. I'm talking about something fairly serious. Yes Bunny has a serious side to her aswell. I cry sometimes, I bleed when I knife cuts into me. Anyway. Why do people hit you with things that you arent expecting? I don't mean hit as in literally but you know, hit you with information that confuses you in the worst way and keeps you awake for ages at night. I'm really confused at the moment. I know I shouldn't be but I am. I don't know how to get rid of my confusion...thoughts anyone?  You get back to me.   Bunny Custard

      Why is Avril Lavinge still wearing that army slash punk shit? I mean ok it was cool like beginning to the middle of last year but now its just getting a little old you know. I think it's kinda sad that a pretty...ish girl like that wants to dress like a wannabe skater. I'm sure she'd look pretty hot if she put on a dress and showed a bit of cleavage. I'd stick it in. Oh well.   Bunny Custard

      Went back to school today...it was shit. School is so depressing. The socialising is cool but the rest is just bbbllllaaaaahhhhh vomit. I checked out my cleavage when I went to the ladies today, I'm proud of my cleavage. I don't really have that much to say really, that's what school does to me...if my braincells had wrists, they'd slit them.   Bunny Custard

      I love it when big breasted girls run up the stairs to get away from the slasher and they have nowhere to go...I mean honestly who would be that stupid, where are they going to run to? Are they expecting some magical door to open up and let them run to freedom are they? I'd love to see a girl get her tits cut off and see the villian juggle them afterwards...ha ha small funny.

      I've noticed that the current design of my school's junior school blouse which I still wear is extremely low cut, on me anyway. What sick phedophile gave the ok to this? Same goes for our short skirts. I mean I don't really care that our uniforms are kinda skanky cause I look hot in it but still eww to the people on the school council who approved of the uniform.

      My cat Boris likes to sit on the couch and suck on a blanket and claw it...why does he do this? It sounds like he gets off over doing it.   Bunny Custard

      I hate it when i go to a underwear store and they never have my bra size...I mean it should go from size A to D not A to only C...what am I spose to do with my huge titties?...Stuff em in a size C bra and have a whole lotta cleavage?...I guess I could do that but then I'd get too much attention from my teachers at school. I don't like it when my teachers give me attention, I like to be left alone in class so I can draw explicit pictures of naked people having hot sweaty sex on my notebooks.  Bunny Custard

      How cool would it be if you had a period barbie that u could stick tampons in and stick pads on her undies. How cool would it be to have a barbie that could bleed from her vagina and have a tummy that bloated...I want one!  Bunny Custard

      suicidal barbie: you can slit her wrists, make her swallow 24 panadol, hang her with a rope and make her O.D on drugs......I want one!   Bunny Custard

      My cat Boris has cat aids. He got it from fighting with ferrel cats and mixing blood...and now he's going to die and go to kitty heaven. That makes me sad. If he dies I want to get him stuffed so he can stand on the shelf in my living room.  Bunny Custard
