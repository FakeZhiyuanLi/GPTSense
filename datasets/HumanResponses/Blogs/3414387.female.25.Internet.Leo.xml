      1.Chocolate-I love chocolate. It is the greates thing on this planet, next to sex  2.sex-sex is the greatest sport that could have ever been invented. I think that sex should be a game at the olympics. I wonder who would win? Would there be a catagory for gay's?  3.Children-you can't have kids unless you have sex. So sex is worth it if you can have a child and enjoy the wonderful gift of life.  4.friends-friends are great. Sometimes you wish that you could kill them, but the majority of the time they are worth haveing.   5.toliet paper-I would really hate to have to wipe my butt with leaves and grass. Can you imagine  6.mothers-where would we be without them?   7.our Cunts-where would the world be without them?  8.flip flops-comeing from a woman that has at least 20 pairs, they are wonderful!!

      Gosh I guess that I have more to say than I thought that I did. I guess it must be bordome or I am just really interesting. It is probaly boredome. I am still at work, don't get off until the sun is down. But that is ok, I don't have to work sat or sun so I can stay in bed in the morning at least till my kid gets me up. Then we will watch cartoons all day. But hey it could be worse. I could be tortued with country music. By the way I have to add this.   The Three C's camel toe country music colored jeans that is the classic cow girl. They all look like this. It is pretty nasty to see. Unless you are a "cowgirl" or like "cowgirls". hahahahahahaha. What a joke. I think that they made a song about "Camel Toes". Gag me. I don't know why anybody would want to look at a girl that wears her jeans so tight that they are up in her crotch. I don't know. That is as bad as some men that wear there jeans so tight that you can see there package. And when it isn't very big and there is nothing there or the stuff there pants. hahahahahahaha. Or it is so big that it looks like a snake in there pants. Kinda taked the fun out of looking. I like there jeans tight but not so tight that they can't walk. "Cowboys" they can be as bad as there partners. A gay "Cowboy". Now that is a funny sight. I think it is the most funniest thing I have every seen. Or a guy from the hood trying to be country. Now that is funny. hahahahahahaha. I have thought of a few other nasty things. Being looked at by a lesbian the way a man looks at me. That is just really nasty. I have a freind that is lezbo and she really thinks that I am the most wonderful twat that is walking on the face of the earth. I just can't go there. That is just to much. I can't imagine putting my mouth on someone elses cunt. that is just nasty.

        I am sitting here at work bored to death. I work a job that they are planning to send to India. Doesn't that just suck. My best freind is gay, and my other best freind has major issues. Yesterday she wanted to kill herself. Blah. As she would say. The only good thing about sitting here and not getting any calls is that I have time to write and read a book. I really hat haveing to deal with stupid people. Coworkers included. At least Cleo doesn't spend all of his time being a cry baby. He has started doing laps around the building. Walking not running. He is very, very overweight. I think it is doing him good. It is doing me good since I am walking with him. Barbie refuses to get out of her chair and walk to. If she did that then she would have no reason to bitch and we couldn't have that. Sometimes I wish that she would just grow up and get real. Wash some of her makeup off and wear some clothes that fit and get a life. It would do her a whole hell lot of good. But she doesn't listen. That would be to easy.

      Ah, Cleo. Cleo is my gay freind. His name is really John, and he wants to be a drag queen. He doesn't understand why cunt is a bad word. He actually just sat right here and said that he wanted one. He asked me if I would be offended if he called me a cunt. Well no, I told him. Why would I. He wants a cunt, but can't have one. hahahahahahaha. The joys of being a woman and in control of the most powerful tool that GOD has ever put on this earth. Think about it. Your CUNT is very powerful. Men will fight and kill for it. Men will wine and dine you to get it. They will make promises to you to get it. Ha. And these narrow minded people think that it is a bad word. Well they must all be women that don't know the power of the cunt. That is my power and I hold it between my legs. I can make men cry and beg with the power. My cunt is a Queen. Queen Cunt. All women should feel this way about there sex. Every last one of them. It doesn't matter that it gets old, or droops. Hell who cares as long as you still have the power. I feel sorry for Cleo. He will never feel the ower of the CUNT. He can only wish that he had that power. Poor baby

      what is a cunt? There are several definitions on the word, and many people have there own ideas on the subject. But I think that a cunt is a very wonderful thing. My cunt houses the most wonderful sensations that can be had. When it is played right that is. Some are ugly and skinny, some are soft and plump and pretty, some are hairy, some are shaved. Mine is soft, plump and shaved. Some say that I have a fat pussy, but none of those men are complaining. They think that it is nice to have to pull the lips apart and see that soft pink meat on the inside that is moist. The inside looks like a rare pink flower that is delicate. Yeah the cunt is a wonderful thing. My three yearold daughter calls hers a kitty. Every now and then she calls it a cunt. I want her to be proud of her sexuality. I don't want her to be ashamed of being a woman. So many women are ashamed. The fat ones think that they can't get a man, and the skinny ones think that they have to be a rail. They are both wrong. Men like our cunts, all cunts, fat or skinny. It doesn't matter. Women like cunts to.
