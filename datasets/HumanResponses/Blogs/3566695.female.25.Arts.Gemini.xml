       Today was my two year anniversery of Dating Stan. -=sigh=- I love him lots! We kinda dated off and on in the beginning, I wanted to be with him, but wasn't sure he wanted to be with me, so we kinda dated off and on until about around August of 2002. He's really sweet and he loves to tease me all the time. It's his favorite pastime. Gotta love those tickle fights, which sadly are a tad one sided. He's stronger than me, so all I can do is squeal.  I made a nice Flash Greeting Card kinda thing for him and showed it to him today. It has our two characters from our cartoons and stories in it. It's pretty cute. ^_^ He liked it. I'm going to post it on my website this evening.  Yesterday, I went to see the movie Troy, with my best friend, Brooke. She's in the Air Force and she's going overseas in two weeks to Korea. :( I'm going to miss her, she's going to be gone for awhile. Of course, I miss her now. She lives a good two hour drive from me now over near the Air Force base. So, we rarely see each other. I love you Brooke! Take care! Send me some good stuff!! I'll write her e-mail when she gets there. Well, I'm off to seduce my man. See ya!  Luv, Chrissy.

       Hiya! I'm so in love with Stan. I'm so happy I moved in with him at his place. He owns about six acres of land behind his house, and it's beautiful here. Tonight, for the first time in years, I saw huge swarms of fireflies! They were everywhere, dancing around the trees and vines like magic. It's a fact that Butterflies, Dragonflies, and Fireflies are all my favorite bugs. There are plenty of them here too! I've seen several different types of Dragonflies since I moved over here. I sat by the woods holding the baby while Stan chased the fireflies. He caught some and showed them to Vince, who stared in wonder. I was kinda hoping one would land on the baby's nose so I could see his reaction. I feel like I'm writing one of my Fairy Tales as I type this, because it's hard for be to believe I'm living in such a way. Stan and I discussed our future. We plan on building a house back in the woods some day soon. We will keep all the trees around it. I can't wait to have our beautiful home built. If we both design it, it WILL look like something out of a Fairy Tale!  Earlier, after doing some work painting my old bedroom at my mom's house, we went to our neighbor's house. They had a large family gathering. Stan and I showed off the baby and our artwork to everyone. We even were promted to do portraits of some of the guests. Everyone was thrilled. Then we sat down on the porch and taught the children how to play Dominos. Everyone waved goodbye and we walked back up to the house to have some Ice Cream. ^_^ Ah ... it was a good day. I'm about to eat dinner! I promice i'll post again really soon!  Luv, Chrissy. O_~

       I added some new content to the Emerald Tokyo Website. I redid the Movies and Games pages, and added two finished games. You can see the pages by following the links.   urlLink Emerald Tokyo Flash Films    urlLink Emerald Tokyo Flash Games   I'm happy to report that I'm not pregnant again. Whew! That's a load off my mind. I've had a fun day. My baby was 5 months old Today. LOL! He went to the Doc's and got some shots. Ooooooooh! He was so mad at that nurse. He gave her dirty looks the rest of the time we were there. He's crawling, sitting up, eating solid foods, and even ... mimicing words. The kid's got brains.  Ah, six more days and it will be my Two year anniversery with Stan. -=deep sigh=- So romantic. I am acting a bit silly, I'm tired and it's late. Time for sleep.  Luv, Chrissy.

       I went for a pregnacy test today. O_o Yipes. Well, it came back negative. Whew! Thank goodness. It's too soon to have another baby. I'm using the Patch to prevent another pregnacy right now. However, I think it might not have worked. There's a chance, the Dr said, that I could actually be pregnant, but the results showed up negative anyway. I must retake the test again soon. >_  Luv, Chrissy.

       Hullo! This is my first post on my first blog. I don't know what made me want to get one. Guess I felt ... I should. For the heck of it. Why not? I'm an open person. And, well, I won't lie. To advertise the heck out of myself and my website. So, you know you probably posted a blog just for attention .... At least I have something to show for this venture.  Well, let's see. This past weekend, my internet was down because of storm damage in my area. I use a high speed connection, and not having it for a weekend when I needed it most, was really frustrating. However, due to the lack of distractions, I was able to get some serious work done. I own a website that I post my flash and artwork on. So, getting some more work finished for it is a good thing. However, I haven't uploaded it yet. I'm such a slacker.  Just to catch anyone who reads this up on my life. I'm a 25 year old mom. I turned 25 on May 24th. I have a Five Month old baby. His name is Vince. I live with the Love of my life, the father of my child, and the guy who works on flash with me. No, I don't mean three different guys. It's all the same wonderful man. Stan. AKA Blaklyon.  I own a website,  urlLink Emerald Tokyo Entertainment , that features my various artistic adventures. I posted a Dressup Doll on Newgrounds about a year ago. I was rushing when I made it and it kinda sucks compared to my latest work. However, it kinda started off my whole adventure of getting my own hosted website. My Angelfire website couldn't take the stress of all the hits I got in just a week of submitting that flash. All my bandwidth kept getting eaten. So, I paid for my own domain name and hosting package. Things just grew from there. The website still has some areas that need to be finished, but, I'm working on it.  Luv, Chrissy.

       My mom had to have surgery on her eye this past Thursday. She had a cataract removed and a lens put in. She's been staying at my sister's house since she's actually blind in her other eye. Well, her vision in her good eye had improved, until when she woke up this morning and couldn't see anything at all.       My mom is a kind of Drama Queen, and when something goes wrong, she freaks out and screams and cries. I was just falling alseep this morning when the phone rang. It was my sister. I could hear my mom throwing a fit in the background. Teresa begged for me to come over and help with my mom since she was throwing an utter fit. It took some doing to calm her down, but she was fine. Teresa is going to take her back to the Eye Doctor tomorrow. The lens must have slipped. Dear God I pray they can fix it. Because if they can't ... we're all in for it. LOL!       I took my mom to her house today to feed her dogs and my Cockatiels. She's holding the birds for me until I can find a place for them here. I helped her run a few errends then dropped her back at my sister's house even though she begged me to let her stay at her own home. As if she can stay by herself when she can't see. =/ Heh.       Anyway. That's it for now.      Luv,   Chrissy.

       Ah. The joys of motherhood. I love my baby. Heehee.  He spilled his Daddy's soda on our Cable Modem, so we were out of an internet connection for a few days. That was kinda funny. I still Rag on Stan for having the soda where the baby could grab it.  Vince has been teething lately, so he is throwing fits all night and refuses to sleep by himself. So, he sleeps on top of me, and I can't sleep like that. It won't be too long though and his teeth will be out. I'm not too bothered by it. Just bothered that I can't get much sleep. He just now fell asleep. Which is good. I'll try to get some sleep now.    Luv,   Chrissy.

       I have a slight problem. I am in love with someone, but I feel lonely. I mean, don't get me wrong, I get all the Physical Romance I need ... Only to him it's probably not romantic, it's probably just, sex.  I feel lonely because he doesn't woo me in any other ways. It's slowly breaking my heart. He doesn't do any of the every day trivial romantic thing; love letters, flowers, candy, cards ..... He keeps telling me and everyone else he plans on getting me a ring ... but it must just slip his mind when it comes to actually getting one. -=sigh=-  It's not so much the trivial romance that I want ... I could care less about a ring or flowers ... though it would be nice ... A simple love letter would work best ...  What I want from him most is the verbal romance. The sweet talk. Him telling me how pretty I am and how much he loves me ... His way of telling me he loves me is asking me "Do you want me to say it?" Meaning Do I want him to say "I love you." He already knows the answer to the qustion! Why the hell does he have to ask me if I want him to say it? He knows I do! He just DOESN'T wanna say it ... so he says that instead. It's like he doesn't really love me or he's afraid he'll sound stupid if he really says it... and it bothers me because I can't tell which one of those is the real problem....  It's getting to the point where I feel like most girls out there who don't even have boyfriends. I dread things like Valentine's Day, Our Anniversery, and other Holiday's because ... There seems like there isn't any love there on his part. I do al the stupid romantic things ... He should be the woman ... and I should be the guy, I swear!  My sister's girlfriend treats her soooo well. She gets her flowers, candy, all kinds of things all the time. Writes a ton of love letters .... songs ... etc for her. Sadly, it makes me jealous. I feel like I should just find someone else .... I would, except for the simple fact I love him ... Why wasn't I born GAY?!?!  Now, I'm actually wishing someone else would come along and start trying to romance me away from him, because at least then I'll be getting the attention I deserve. :( And maybe it'll open his eyes to the fact he might loose me ...      Luv,   Chrissy  .

       What a week ... My right shoulder has Tendonitus. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when I move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer .... it kills me. I can't move it much now because I was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely get up strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but I'll get better.      My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon.      My love life is going better. Stan's getting to be more loving lately. I think he's just too absent minded to be romantic. His mind is always on other things like Flash Projects, what movie he wants to see next, what video games he wants to rent next, etc. So, he never really thinks about romance ... Hmm. Can't teach an old dog new tricks. I'm stuck with this.      There are new cartoons on my website and my Tetris game's High Score Board works properly now. That's some of what I've been busy working with on the site.      Luv,   Chrissy.
