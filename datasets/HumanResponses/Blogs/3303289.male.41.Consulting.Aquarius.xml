      I live in a condo.&nbsp; It is a nice condo.  I live on the second floor.&nbsp; If some one comes by to visit, they press the button for my buzzer.&nbsp; I will then pickup the phone and buzz them in.&nbsp;   Today is was having problems with my cable.&nbsp; I was on the phone with Time Warner and on a long hold.&nbsp; Then my door phone buzzed.&nbsp; I put Time Warner on speaker and answered the door phone.&nbsp; It was some one who said that they had something for me to sign.&nbsp; I asked who they were and who he repressented.&nbsp; He would not say.&nbsp; I told them that I was busy and went back to my regular phone waiting for Time Warner.&nbsp; While I was on with Time Warner the door phone kept buzzing for about 5 minutes and then stopped.&nbsp; I guess that he just went away.&nbsp; I still don't know who this guy was.&nbsp; But at least my cable is working again.

      I met with my men's ACT group to day at St. Matthews church.&nbsp; We had mass first and the met in a small room in the church.&nbsp; There were only four of us.&nbsp; We discussed Gary Guillory's divorce status and how he is feeling.&nbsp; He informed us that Dr. Murphy was going to side with him and that she will recommend that he gets custody of the kids.&nbsp;   Another member started discussing his marital situation.&nbsp; He was explaining that he is tired of his wife's taking advantage of him.&nbsp; If she leaves clothes on the couch or forgets to do something then he has to pick up the slack.&nbsp; He has expressed how tired this makes him.&nbsp; But he also expressed that he figures that this is a small price to pay for peace with in the home.&nbsp;

      Saturday 7/31/04 my ex served me with papers, taking me back to court.  She is wanting the back child support for the period that I was not working.  In the motion, she is requesting that I be placed in jail for nonpayment.    I have been working since the beginning of June and have been making the child support payments for the past two months. Now I will have to hire an attorney.  This will cost money that I cannot afford.  Sadly I will have to use my car to pay the attorney.
