      Dang, I forgot to post yesterdays blog, lol. Today was awesome. I went with Stephen, Jordan, Eric, Mike, Cory and Kyle to Reds at the mall. We had two games of bowling. I got 3rd on the first game and 2nd on the second. I almost beat the pro bowler Cory. That was close, I had 111pts and he had 117. I will get him next time with my luck, lol. Then we went to glow in the dark mini golf. I suck at that, but I placed 4th anyways. I know that's crap! Steven, Kyle, Jordan and I went to the two dollar theatre to see Rundown, it's a good movie. They had crazy pplz, horny and vicious monkeys in the movie. Kinda funny with lots of action and adventure. We had supper at New York Fries. Mmmmmmmm, talking about it makes me hungry, we had 'The Works'. Yummy... Before I left for home, I went to galaxyland to stalk vlad, he was working at the rockin rocket. Gave us a free ride. Thanx vlad. Today was a busy day, and the next 2 days will be busy too. I'm never gonna finish my english essay and social debate, lol.

      I went to the mall at 10 today with kyle, matt, emy and ling. Kyle and I ditched them in the first 10 minutes, lol. We did matt a favour. Yep. I got a hoody at sportchek, the line up was like 20m long. We saw marshall there with his dad and Kyle asked them if we can line up behind them since they were really close to the register. But marshall disagreed. DAMN YOU MARSHALL! You wasted like 20 mins of our time!!! *really angry. Then we went to galaxyland to stalk vlad. We accused him of molestation because he was working at the galaxyland kids place where they have a jungle of tubes and stuff like that for children to get lost. Haha, I went there when I was little. Then we just walked around to different places throughout the mall. Saw a lot of friends there, lol. The mall was jammed! The line at tommy hilfigers was really long. People were still waiting to go in at 3 in the afternoon! In the evening, I went to a party at a parents friend. My mom drop me back at 8 because I was bored, lol. Nothing there to do! I'm probably gonna watch tv soon because I don't feel like going on the computer now. I'm computer sick because I played online pool for like 8 hours yesterday. I know it's sad!

      I went skiing for the whole afternoon today. I'm getting better kyle, lol. In the evening I went to my parent's friends house for supper. We had steak, chicken, bruschetta, potatoes, cabbage rolls, salad, apple cinnamon crisp topped with cream(everything you can imagine!). Yeah, I packed myself. I think I got kinda drunk because I had a small cup of champagne, lol lol lol, vlad says that the symptoms of drunkness is laughing, lol lol lol. Their family is pretty nice and their children are nice too. The older daughter is kinda weird though. She is 15 and goes to Ross Shep. I suppose she's kinda cute and nice. But then she was talking to me about getting a 'belly button pierce', yeah you heard me right. I wasn't drunk then! *cough cough. So then I didn't say anything. She also said that they make fun of OSA in their school. Lol, so it's true, we are geeks! Oh well, can't help it if we are too smart or hard working! Merry christmas everyone! *burp

      Busy day today. I went to the mall with matt at 1:30 to do some really last minute christmas shopping for some friends. Really busy at the mall today. And then we met with vlad at 3:30 to go to galaxyland. He was our ticket in, lol, because he work's there and I used to work there so we can get in free! Yay! We went on the bumper cars, autosled, swings, spaceshot and I went on the mindbender with vlad. On the second time, I sat on the car that faced backwards. That was sweet and more freaky, haha. Well, I loved it, I'm probably gonna go again, lol. I love galaxyland! I'm probably gonna watch tv or stay on the computer for the whole night. Yup yup. Probably going skiing tomorow with a friend and then to a part√© at a parents friends. Can't wait till christmas, two more days!

      I went skiing again today. I snowed so many strangers. None complained, lol. I had a lot of fun. The only thing that pissed me off was an instructor at snow valley who crashed into me as I was getting off the chairlift. I'm like "what the fuck?". They should hire better instructors. And I also saw some really hot ski chick, I was staring at her and her movement for like an hour. Haha, I'm so sad. But she was really hot, in fact she's probably the hottest girl on the hill, haha. *drool... I think she's probably 18/19 years old. There was also many bitchy snowboarding chicks. I was on the chairlift with 2, one said something about another girl being a slut. I wanted to say "look who looks like the slut (implying that she does)" because she was wearing a tank top in freezing weather. I just don't understand, what the hell is wrong with those ppl? Wearing a tank top when its freezing, somebody has gotta kick some sense into that person's head. Lol. I might be going to the mall soon with some friends, I will update later.

      I went to the mall today just to go around and browse to see what I want to get. I saw vlad working at galaxyland, talked to him for a while. I want to go to galaxyland again, I love that place even though I have been there so many times and worked there during the summer. I also did some studying for the midterms. I'm not procrastinating for once. Yay, that's an improvement. Oh, I also had my boring piano lesson this morning. And I got paid for teaching my mom and bro how to play scales and triads (blah blah) better. They suck at it, horrible I tellya, their scales make my ear burst. What can you expect when the piano studio lets some freaking grade 6 girl teach them. Lol. I have also watched Romeo Must Die for like the 15th time and malcolm in the middle. I'm just gonna stay on MSN for a while and then go to bed. Tomorow I might go to galaxyland with vlad and do more christmas shopping for a friend (Jody) who just came back from boarding school. Hope you pplz are enjoying your christmas break. Cya...

      Hey hey hey everybody. Today is the one of the best day in 2003. Last day of school! Yayayay! I enjoyed my santograms, except the one from the stalker. Reveal yourself stalker! I went to watch LOTR at 6. It's a long movie but it was good. It's a must see! You will never regret seeing it. It's absolutely fantastic! Winter lit was also fun too. But raia kinda screwed it up since she smacked my head for some damned reason. Argh, hate that girl. Wait a second, she's not a 'girl', she's a vicious beast I tellya! I'm gonna be staying up late to watch kenshin and stay on MSN. Gonna go skiing tomorow and maybe go to galaxyland! I want to go on the rollercoaster again. That's so fun.

      I went skiing for the whole day today. Yep yep. From 12 till 5. My fingers are frozen now. They feel kinda numb and they look purplish. Hopefully they are still alive. Hehe. Skiing was crazy, there were so many shitty skiers on the hill. They can't control where they are going. And I saw some skiers do 720s and land backwards perfectly! That's so sweet! I will be studying bio for like 2 hours tonight and then I will probably watch TV or stay on MSN.

      Finally, it has all come down to this. The last day of hell of this year. FRIDAY! French quiz and a math test. I hope I do well on them. Here goes everything! I did pretty good on my english presentation today, I was kind of nervous but still managed to get 85%. Ha! Steven, you owe me a frappucino now, haha. I made the outline and helped my buddies a lot for the presentation. I almost made the whole body paragraph by myself. Steven and Riphay were so incompetant and lazy. Argh!!!!! I also got 77% on my physics. Not as bad as I thought but I could have done better. Oh well, gotta move on.

I do look Chinese, not Jap, honky or Korean. I speak mandarin fluently! Gtg, post later.

      At school now, its so boring. Some of you are wondering why my name is "Philo",ok, now you well have an explanation: The name "Philo" is from a TV show where this person Philo is supposed to be a stalker. I picked this name not because I will be a stalker but the name just sounds cool. The name ISN'T related to anybody! Keep that in mind Matt! NO! I will probably be studying for most of the day, I have so many tests and presentations. Cya everybody!

      I'm so tired today. Yesterday I went to bed at midnite, but I couldn't sleep. I woke up like every 15mins. I have a big headache today. I just spent like 3 hours doing english with Stephen. I gotta practice an hour of piano soon, study for physics and do my computer science crap. I probably won't be free till like 7:30. Oh well, I will play next week.

      Busy day today. Right after I woke up at 9, i had to go to my piano lesson. Argh, grade 9 is so hard, but I can't quit now, I'm so close to finishing piano and become a master pianist, haha. Allen as a master pianist, just hard for me to imagine. WE after that Riphay came over and we did our social cartoons. Then Stephen came over and we all did our English presentation outline. There was so much argument from Stephen. Since Riphay and I agreed to my views, Stephen lost. HA! You lost Stephen, two against one. Your efforts were fruitless! Well, anyways we went to watch The Last Samurai, Stephen didn't come though, the movie was great. It's a must see if you like 19th century Japan, Kenshin, and a lot of beheading and gore. I won't get into any details though. IT'S A MUST SEE!!! I COMMAND EVERYONE WHO SEES THIS MESSAGE TO WATCH IT A.S.A.P. Well now I am on the computer again. I will probably sleep early since I got another busy day again tomorow. Goodnite everyone!

      Hey, good afternoon everyone. I stayed up for the whole night yesterday watching Kenshin and Inuyasha on my computer. I went to T&T at 11 and then to Galaxyland to visit some buddies. I'm probably gonna go out again with some friends today in the afternoon. My dad is coming home from his business trip to China. Yay! I will update the site later and probably with some Kenshin pictures soon. Argh, I probably hafta do some studying too though. The damn physics and math test, oh and the English oral.

      I went skiing at Snow Valley right after school today. Had lotsa fun snowing people. I was kinda mean though but oh well, the temptation to snow stupid boarders sitting in the middle of the hill was overmastering. I snowed this one boarder at the chairlift line. She said "hey!", I did say sorry and then she asked for my name. For some odd reason, this stranger was interested in me or something. So we went up the chairlift together, talked and went down the hill. The girl had blonde hair, blue-green eyes and she was around 5'7", she wasn't obese or anything. Half an hour later, she had to go and the weird thing is that she asked for my contact information, so I only gave her my e-mail. I didn't think she'd add me but she just did. This is weird, is this how girls meet new friends or something. Talking to some stranger that snowed her at a ski hill. Well anyways, I had Domino's pizza for supper, went to the Callingwood Safeway to help my mom with her groceries and then went back home to do some physics homework. Now, I'm on MSN, chatting with some friends, I probably will try to stay up for the whole night though watching anime or something. It is a long weekend afterall. Well good night and enjoy your weekend peoples.

I didn't go skiing because I didn't want to today but I will tomorow. I didn't do too much today except visit Phillis. I'm signing up for this Go-Gaia thingy even though I don't know what it really is and how to play it, lol.

      M'kay Kyle, STOP SPAMMING! Ok ok, today I went with mike, steven, jordan and the stupid looking blonde guy to WEM. I saw billy, jessica and sophie there. We played a game of bowling but I lost, too bad, my luck isn't good today but then I did pretty good when playing pool. I stayed at the mall for like 10 hours. Later, around 6 when everybody started to leave, I went to London Drugs and there I saw Julia, she was reading some magazine, she didn't notice me until I called her. I wasn't sure if it was her because she looked kinda different (got her hair streaked again, lol), we talked for a while and then I went with Riphay to Along Came Polly. Really good movie, go watch it ASAP. Soleed!

      Big day today! Midterms are over! Yay. Now, it's time to forget about it and rejoice, it never happend. All was a terrible nightmare that dissipated when you woke up with a pencil in your hand and a test paper on your desk. Did I say a 'test paper', no I didn't, I meant scrap paper. Well, I had nothing big planned for today but tomorow I do.   Friday: Sleep in, go to the mall and then watch a movie with Riphay, Michele and maybe Kelin, Prabhjot and Julia. The 'Big Bounce'. The movie is supposed to be hot (hotties), lol.  Saturday: Ski and stalk Phillis at galaxyland. Lol. Penny chucking time!XDXD  Sunday: Ski and probably go to a friends, lol. Dunno yet... Call me if you have anything planned!  OMG OMG OMG OMG, it's gonna be a great weekend!

      Yes, midterms is basically finished. I don't care much about physics because it's mostly formulas and calculations so I slept through the entire afternoon. I gotta catch up on my sleep, lol. I only got around 6 hrs of sleep for the past 9 days so yeah, that tells you how sleepy I am. I can't wait till the weekend. Gonna watch the Big Bounce, go to the mall again, and of course skiing!

      Ok, ok, just two more midterms and we will be all done unless your in science, damn you pplz. I think I did ok on todays math midterm. I finished in like 55 min but I spent another 50 min checking my test over. I either did really well or really bad because I don't think its normal for pplz to finish so fast. I'm gonna study some bio today, just look over the packages, it shouldn't be that hard. Right after the midterm, I got into a big debate with Sam on computer stuff, intel+amd vs mac, it was so geeky, lol.

      I did some studying today. Yesterday was crazy. Big party at my place, we had like 60 guests. Me and mike packed ourself with sushi, egg rolls, spring rolls and other goodies then we stayed downstairs on the computer. Mike took over my msn, so if I (mike) said anything offensive just forget about it. After he left, I played online pool with kyle till like midnite. I was so freaking tired. I went to bed at 3 and today I had to get up at 9 in order to catch my piano lesson. This week is gonna be easy. French: not gonna study. Math: look over (2hrs max). Bio: look over exercise packages (3hrs max). Physics: not gonna study (I know everything, muahahaha!). I can't wait till the midterms are finished, MORE SKIING! Good snow. Oh and I want to watch "The Big Bounce", yep yep, maybe on friday or saturday. Who wants to come? Phone, post, e-mail or tell me on msn.

      Omg, my parents were so pissed at me because of my math test. I got way lower than usual! Geez, shoulda studied more. I thought I knew everything! The brite side: my math avg is still 90%. I gotta study more for the midterms, I only studied like 3 hours today. Not much but I think I will be ok. Or would I? Shit, I'm gonna fail I'm gonna fail. *panicking I'm gonna go insane if I study more. Much of my time today was wasted on the phone. My parents kept on phoning relatives and friends back in China to wish them a happy CHINESE new year and they wanted me to go on the phone every 5 mins just to say: Happy new year (grandma, grandpa, cousin huang, cousin yang, etc). I don't think that I even know all my cousins. I haven't seen them for 11 years. The last time I seen them was in Shanghai when I was 4. All I remember was getting addicted to coca cola. Lol. Well, I better go, I'm sleepy. I really shouldn't have stayed awake all friday evening and sleep so late on saturday.

      Ok, ok, I'm gonna go study for the whole day from today. I have a bad feeling about the midterms. I'M GONNA FAIL! From now on till next thursday, I will watch no more than 1/2 hour of tv per day and no more than 1/2 on the computer. I will not go skiing or to the mall. I must resist all temptations to go out with friends on the weekends. After this week of hell is over, I'm gonna play 24/7! Almost there, just another 9 days of hell!

      I need to get back to studying tomorow, ASAP. I hate midterms! Today, I went to the mall. Saw Chantelle and Manda at TT. Phillis saw me passing by at galaxyland. So we talked a while and had lunch together. She got me hooked on Arby's fries. They are so good, crispy and with less grease! Mike got me hooked on bejeweled, a game on msn. It's just as good as online pool. I'm playing online pool right now with kyle. He's getting lucky. Damn him. lol.

      Just studied today. I did so bad on my english essay. My mark was unimaginably low compared to my other marks. It pulled my fcuking english avg down by like 30%. I wasn't the only one that did bad though, phew, the class failed with me, lol. The highest mark was like 63%, and only around 5 ppl passed! Tuba is going insane. She failed the whole class! Well, I bet Raia got like 100. Damn her. Oh well, at least I wasn't the worst in my class but my mark is nothing to be proud of, lol. I'm probably gonna stay on the computer or watch tv for the whole night. Tomorow, I will probably do some studying and go to the mall or something.

      I studied for pretty much the whole day today. I don't get a lot of the things in physics but I know how to do the questions perfectly! It's scary. Oh, I got smashed in the face by Anthony in Physical Ed. My glasses were kinda screwed up but I fixed it. I can't wait till midterms is over. So much stuff to do. Gotta put more stuff on my site and go out with some friends and skiing. Lol. Can't forget that. Btw, Kyle and Japjot, STOP SPAMMING MY FCUKING SITE!!!

      I had to study biology for one hour in the morning. I finally get the microscope calculations. Went skiing in the afternoon. The powder sux at snow valley because of the freezing rain. Gosh, I hate the fcuking weather. My jacket, ski poles, skiis, helmet and googles were frozen after an hour. Skiing felt like skating and it's impossible to stop. It was like a field of ice! Some boarder tried to stop in the middle of the hill but she fell fowards and rolled all the way down. I left snow valley at 3:30, then I was planning to go to the mall. But then I decided to head home since I gotta do some social studying and go ahead in physics tonite. So much studying to be done. MY HEADS GONNA BLOW!

      Go download this, it's a good song but it's Japanese. Only Jpop and Jrock fans will like it. Hehe.  Name:YOU by Ayumi Hamasaki Lyrics: Ayumi Hamasaki  Your face is more beautiful when you're sad. I couldn't say even one word, When I noticed, you had brimmed over with tears. That must have hurt much more than I thought. I'm tired. I'm sorry that I didn't notice.  The spring wind rolls by, it draws a far off dream. The break in the summer clouds disappeared. The autumn sky is painful, the winter sea is cold The more I fall into a trance the more time passes.  Many events have slipped by. And you, here, now, I'm proud of you, always. People are not memories that you can put into words. They live holding onto their feelings.  Sometimes you take only the roundabout way and get tired. But the place I finally get to is just by your side, and my heart is healed. I want to be that kind of support someday.   Japanese Romanji Lyrics:  kimi no sono yokogao ga kanashii hodo kirei de nani hitotsu kotoba kakerarenakute kidzukeba namida afurete'ru kitto minna ga omotte iru yori zutto kizu tsuite'ta ne tsukarete ita ne kidzukazu ni ite gomen ne  haru no kaze tsutsumarete haruka na yume egaite natsu no kumo tokirete wa kiete itta aki no sora setsunakute fuyu no umi tsumetakute muchuu ni natte iku hodo toki wa tatte ita ne  takusan no dekigoto o kugurinukete kita n da soshite ima koko ni iru kimi no koto hokori ni omou itsu no hi mo hito tte kitto kotoba ni naranai you na omoide da to ka kimochi o kakae sou shite ikite iku n da ne  toomawari bakari shite tsukareru toki mo aru ne da kedo saigo ni tadoritsuku basho tte soba ni iru dake de tada kokoro ga iyasarete'ku sonna sasae ni itsu ka naritai to negau yo

I'm gonna play some MOHS soon and then watch some tv. My parents got company over for a party again. This one is gonna last a lone time. Lol. For, some reason I don't think my MSN list is big enough. Gotta add more pplz, lol. I only got like 45 pplz on my list. And only around 10 of them are always on. I'm kinda tired talking to the same pplz. 20 other friends are on at least once every 2 days. The rest uses them once a week. And when Raia comes on, all she does is insult me. *burst into tears...

      Omg, we have some chinese guests over here and my dad just told them I was a BANANA. Geez, never thought that my dad would say that. That's Kyle's phrase. The first week of school is over for 2004. So much studying to do. Now I know how brutal OSA can be. I shouldn't have applied for this school. My friends at like Ross Shep and FX only have like 3 midterms and 1 final and they are probably dead ezee. I am not gonna survive this term. Gonna fail like most of the tests. Nooooooooo! I'm gonna take today off. Tomorow I will probably go skiing again and do some studying. I'm gonna spend all sunday studying though, I got a social and bio test on monday. Math on friday. Still haven't done social debate yet.

      Yesterdays party was great. We played a game, listened to some music and had a pillow fight. It was so fun but it also hurts. The objective was to hit eachother with pillows and get as many pillows as you can. Girls vs Boys. Not really fair. There were only 2 boys, me and matt and there was 6 girls. Michele and Prabhjot didn't really participate. Matt my 'ally' made a truce with the girls half way through the fight, so I continued with the fight until they all left. It was awesome. We kept on smacking eachother in the face with couch pillows. In order to stop the girls from taking our pillows, we had to sit on them. Jody was a bugger, she stayed on a couch beside us and whenever me and matt didn't pay attention to her, she would come, smack us on the head and take our pillows. That evil girl! I considered that I won the game because matt didn't do much, and I got all the pillows when all the girls left. Oh btw, thanks michele for helping me when Zoe and Kelin were trying to steal my pillow. She dragged them back, lol. Today, a friend came over, we played some computer games and had pizza. In the evening, I spent some time on my english essay. I got 400 words! Ha, I'm so good! :P

In the evening, I watched The Big Bounce with some friends, the movie was pretty good, it had a nice surprising ending! Today, I got do some homework, I haven't done anything for the weekend yet! I also have a piano concert in the afternoon, *nervous, wish me luck everybody!

      Errrrrrrr, so many problems recently. Some people are just really annoying and are complete bastards! Well, I'm gonna move on because I don't even want to talk about those people, they just really piss me off, I can almost beat the crap outta them. Sorry for my inappropriate language buddies, I'm just really pissed right now. I'm glad that this is an early week, I feel really tired and lazy. I don't really want to work at school right now for some reason and I can't concentrate. I'm just gonna relax and see some friends during the weekend. Stay on the computer for today. Tomorow I will either go skiing or to some friends place. On friday, I want to watch a movie with some friends, dunno which movie yet, I'm ok just as long as it's good! Saturday, I got a piano concert that I really don't want to go to, geez, I hate piano concerts, they make me nervous. *choke choke. The piano concert will only last around 1 hour though so it isn't that bad, after that I will try to find something to do to burn my time. Sunday, I have no idea what I plan to do yet, I will probably finish off some hw.

      I dunno what's wrong with me today. For some reason, I don't feel well emotionally. I feel that something's wrong, something is going to happen and I'm sad for some odd reason. I don't even know why. I don't really feel stressed because of my homework but I do feel kinda depressed. Maybe I didn't get enough sleep last night, only 5 hours. I couldn't concentrate in any subject today, I don't remember anything! I'm screwd.

      Week over! Communications is so freakin boring, I almost fall asleep in class, Derek did behind me. He was reading for like 2 mins and then he collapsed, lol. I envy you pplz who have physical ed. CALM is so easy, you don't really do much, after you finish your work in class you just leave and Mr. Depoe doesn't care! Yesterday, I left at 12:25! I didn't do too much yesterday. After school, I went with Riphay, Julia and Kelin to the mall to watch 'Winning a Date with Tad Hamilton', yes I know mike its another chick flic but I had nothing better to do. Then me and Riphay walked around in the mall and had something to eat. In the evening I was on go-gaia for like 2 hours. MORE GOLD!!!

It was really windy so we stayed in a tent. We stayed at a lake for about 8 hours, it was cold. When I got home, I was frozen and I smelled like fish. I never want to go ice fishing again.

She just found out yesterday and she will be leaving tomorow for Vancouver and on saturday to Sichuan, China. She was one of my really good childhood friends. I won't even get a chance to say farewell to her!!! I'm so sad... :(... I know I will miss her a lot. Hopefully, I can go see her this summer in China if I go, I really hope so. Last time I saw her was at a party during Christmas break.  I hope I will see her soon, Farewell Andrea...

I'm going to a friends birthday party tomorow, it should be fun, lots of people! I want to go biking but the weather is horrible this week. How can it snow in mid April??? I just don't get that. It was like 18 degrees a few days ago and now it's back to winter! But the temperature should go back to normal soon then I can go out again.

      ONE THING: SPAMMING IS JUST NOT FUNNY  Comon people and be serious! Spamming is just not funny, who spends their time to spam just to discredit somebody that they hate? or they don't like. It's such a waste of time and it can get really annoying. If you don't have anything good to say then simply don't say it PERIOD! Use your time wisely because time=gold, time is precious, you can never gain it back after it goes by; so instead of spamming tagboards, go do something productive.  Stalking people on go gaia isn't funny either. Only retards spend their time making a new account and send annoying private messages saying "U suck.." or "I hate u..." to people that they don't like. I'm not gonna list any names here but you know who you are. That's just not cool.  Some questions:  1. Why do people spam to offend somebody? 2. What is their motive behind it? 3. What do they accomplish by spamming other than wasting their time? 4. What is in return for them?

      I'm so tired today. Slept at 3a.m. and I had to wake up at 8 to go to a piano lesson. I haven't started on my essays yet so I have to get them done before school starts. Only 4 more days!!! Spring Break is passing away fast! I went to watch Hidalgo yesterday, it was a pretty good movie. Riphay wanted to watch it because it had "caramel" people in it (I have nothing against caramel ppl...). I went to a friends in the evening, played some Soul Caliber 2 there and watched Bedazzled. It's a excellent movie, go watch it everybody! I didn't do much today besides going grocery shopping with my mom at like 4 different places, I feel really sleepy now, I'll probably go to bed a bit early today, mebbe 11 or 12, but I will be sure to sleep in! XPXP Enjoy your last 4 days everyone then sch**l starts again! Ack, I don't want to type that word. L8ter!

      Bleh, I've just realized that I have been acting kinda of unusual lately (not being myself...). I don't know why, so if I ignored you, or got pissed off at you for no reason, or said something offensive, please take it back. Don't take me seriously for the next few days. I just not feeling right.  My weekend did not turn out as I expected. Didn't watch "Troy", because Matt and Ling wanted to study for finals. I didn't work, because I feel lazy today, and I can't go biking since it's raining.   All I did today was basically waste some time at home, and walked to the mall in the afternoon. YES! That's right! I "walked" to the mall in the rain. Even though I brought an umbrella, it didn't help much, my pants were wet! At least I wore a rain-jacket. ^^ I know it's kinda insane to walk 5km to the mall in this weather. I only walked around with some friends at the mall, picked up my pay stub, and went on some rides with some co-workers after their shifts. Solar Flare is awesome, wheeeeeeeeeee. $130 paycheck! That should last me a while, heh. One of my friends was going to drop me back home; instead, he ditched us, and played like 4 hours of Warcraft III at Blueshift Gaming. I wouldn't be surprised if he was still there. Crazy gamer- he goes to the mall like every two days to play 7hrs of computer games.   I would also like to thank my friend, Ryan, for buying me a black cowboy hat in Calgary, for my bday. Even though my bday was 2 weeks ago, thanks for the bday present. It's very nice and comfortable!

      o.O, short week. One more day till long weekend , hehe. Plans for the weekend: watch "Troy" with Matt, Ling and Emy. Bike more. Maybe work (don't have a shift but I can sub for somebody else). And that's about all...  I took a long walk really late on saturday. I wasn't feeling very well "emotionally", I don't want to talk about it. But I walked from 10p.m. till 4a.m., I was surprised that my parents even let me out that late. It was kinda scary. I carried a debt card, cell phone and a flashlight (just in case...). After I got home, I crashed for a few hours, heh. I shouldn't do that again. And the sex nurse came on tuesday. FINALLY! She had a whole buncha contraceptives to show us. Condoms, diaphragms, sponges, and all that... Prabhjot S. was completely disgusted but the other Prabhjot seemed amused, hehe. Rieza joined the class too. The nurse passed some condoms around for us to "look" at. She keeps on saying that there are "buckets of condoms at their health centre" and they are "free so don't be shy to pick up some." Remember people, if you are getting laid, do it safe!

       KEY  by Ayumi Hamasaki  If I could use lots of colors and draw my feelings, I'd pick up a brush and paint a picture.  If I could line up lots of words and choose my feelings, I'd pick up a pen and write a letter.  But I can't do that, so I decided to sing this song. I can't do anything else. I turn they key and send it to you.  In your days of tears I embraced one strength and promised to be by your side.  So you don't need to cry, even though I can't explain it very well.  In your days of smiles I want to embrace and praise two kindnesses, that we thought of each other.  From now until forever...

      Just came back from another tiring day of work. I got $4 in commission! Woopdeedooo... My day at work was kind of interesting. I sold a photo showing a couple kissing on the rollercoaster, I saw some 'suspicious-looking' big guy wearing a long black raincoat again, and when I was visiting another worker who was working on Spaceshot Photos, he sold a picture of 2 girls wearing miniskirts. Believe me... you don't want to wear a miniskirt or shorts while going on that ride, it reveals your ... My co-worker put the picture on the big TV screen and he kept on staring at the picture, heh, what a pervert. That's about it for today, I got another day of work tomorow.

      Gah, I woke up today at 10:30 with a major headache. I was still feeling sleepy. For lunch, my family went to Pizza Hut for their buffet, and we went to T&T to do some shopping after that. In the afternoon, I watched some TV, and made like 80 posts on go-gaia. At around 8pm, I went to Riphays to play more Soul Caliber 2. I'm really addicted to that game, and I'm crazy with Yoshimitsu, heh. Btw, Riphays computer room is really hot, I don't think it has ventilation. He was wearing a sweater... crazy. I swear that his room is hot enough to cook salmon. Anyways, I just got back not long ago. I will probably go to bed soon, since I got another day of work tomorow, and the day after.

      Oh, one more thing. Some lady really pissed me off today when my friend and I were biking through the heart of downtown. As we were crossing a road, some lady walked right up to me and angrily shouted "You were really going to do that, huh? You were? Weren't you? You f*ck... [more obscenities...]" Everybody was staring at us, even the drivers in their cars... I had no idea what the lady was talking about- I didn't do anything... She probably mistakened me for another person. I don't know that lady, and I've never seen her... But the lady sure pissed me off when she spazzed at me, since I didn't know what she was talking about. She's lucky that I'm not mean and aggressive like some people, or else she could have been beaten to the ground.

      Guess what? I went biking again today. It's becoming a routine... This time, a friend and I biked to downtown. We biked to Mac so he can pick up his report card, then we headed east towards downtown. Unfortunately, his tire popped when we arrived near Kingsway, so we searched for a repair shop for almost an hour No luck though, we went to like 5 places where they might sell bike tires and tubings, but they didn't. :( Anyways, we kept on biking even though his tire was out. We went to China Town, got some bubble tea, and I bought some stuff. At around 4, we headed back to my place on the River Valley Trail. I feel so wasted... I don't think I'm going biking for another few days, heh. Oh, and I got a slight tan, the UV is really high outside, and I didn't use any sunscreen.   I didn't do much tonight; I just stayed on msn for a while and watched some TV. I took a nap in front of my computer, but then Samantha woke me up by sending a message on msn despite my msn name "Philo [Taking a nap in front of comp,COUNT YOURSELF DEAD IF DISTURBED]". I will probably go to bed earlier than usual, since I'm really tired... *yawn* Zzzzzzzz...

      Nothing new... More biking with a friend today, this time, we biked to Snow Valley. I should of brought my skiis!!! Heh, jk. But I always wanted to check out Snow Valley in the summer. Anyways, I'm going to have supper right away and then I will be going to a friends and play some Soul Caliber 2 and watch some movies. I watched Kill Bill Volume 1 again and Eurotrip the [Unrated] version a few days ago. Both were really good, but Eurotrip was kinda nasty, so if you are planning to watch it, I suggest the rated version.

      Soooooooooooo tired and sleepy. I was going to sleep in today, because I slept really late last night. But my parents woke me up at like 8:30, since they had some business to do in Calgary. They dropped me off at work around 9:30, 2 and half hours early!!! I was so bored... What pissed me off the most was that they picked me up around 9pm, 45min late! I could have used those two hours in the morning to sleep, and the 45 min in the evening to do something fun...

      I spent most of the day biking with friends. First, at noon, we stopped at the mall to check my galaxyland shifts. After that, we biked, heading west, and getting lost. We reached some communities such as Aldergrove, Primrose, and Parkwest. We had no idea where we were, and we got lost in Parkwest. Then, we reached Anthony Henday Drive, which is pretty damn far from my house so we headed south. We biked for like 30 min passing going through a maze of roads and trails until we finally reached the Whitemud Freeway, and we went home. 4 hours of biking!!! I'm really tired.  In the evening, I went for a 10km walk around midnight, and I got home around 1:20. Pretty late, eh? I don't think my parents know that I went out since they were already asleep when I left. If they knew, I probably would be dead by now, heh.   Well, I better go to bed, I still have 8 and a half hours of work tomorow.

      Last two weeks have been very busy, because of the finals. Now, we're basically finished! Only chemistry tomorow.   Here's what I did for the past few days:  Saturday: Went to the mall, and I did some studying when I got back.  Sunday: [Can't really remember...] I think I did some studying and then went for a bikeride.  Monday: Went for a bike ride after school and played some bball in the evening.  Tuesday: Went for a bike ride at 9pm with a friend, rented some movies, watched them, and slept at 6 in the morning.  Wednesday: Slept really late yesterday so I woke up at like 3pm. I was half of my day already. I went biking with Riphay to Futureshop and the mall in the afternoon. Just finished like an hour of chemistry studying, going to play some bball and then watch some tv.

      Mm'kay, time to blog again:  Friday:   My parents had some guests over for supper. I stayed home, did a bit of studying and then wasted my time on the computer.   Saturday:  I went to pick up my pay stub at Galaxyland in the morning, $70, not much, but good enough for one shift. After lunch, I watched Shrek 2 with some FX friends. Heh, haven't got to the studying part yet. After the movie, I went home to do some studying. I finished studying Physics! Heh, one subject finished, like 5 more to go... :( Then I had supper, and watched some TV for the evening.  Sunday:  Ack, boring piano lesson in the morning again. And I've studied for like 4 hours for Social and Math. Played some basketball in the afternoon and I went for a bike ride after that. I need a new basketball net, mine is like torn apart. [The 'swish' sound is not as good as before... :'(]   Yes, that's about all for my boring weekend, nothing much happened. Oh btw, 4 more days till our DOOM!!! We are all screwed for the finals. Well, at least I am...

      Here's my activity for the past few days:  Saturday:   Worked from 12-8:30 again. It seems like I only get 8 and a half hour shifts, they are so long and boring; I hate them. Sooooooooo tired... Galaxyland Gamers are going to get new uniforms and a new logo soon. We get the red shirts now, hehe. Should I be happy? I don't know. Is this some Galaxyland plan to boost morale and make the workers happy? Probably... I also did a bit of homework after work, but I didn't study for long, only 1 hour, I'm really screwed for the finals.   Sunday:   Boring piano lesson early in the morning. I studied and did my homework in the backyard but I couldn't concentrate. I spent about 5 hours but I kept on falling asleep like every 15 mins. So much for efficiency...   My parents had some Taiwanese friends come over for supper. I know them pretty well too for like 7 years, so they are old friends. This time, they brought their children from Taiwan, my brother was babysitting them since they are still small [3+7 years old]. As we were having supper, they asked me if I had a girlfriend(s). For some reason, they always ask me that question, everytime they see me since I was 9. I don't get why they are so interested in my personal life. I just laughed; I was also kind of nervous, because my parents were staring at me and waiting for me to say something. [most likely a name or two] But I didn't say anything and left the table. That's about it for sunday, all I remember after supper was MSN.   Monday:   Boring day, screwed the Chem quiz [he told me that there was going to be NO definitions and only calculations, wtf???]. Lots of homework and studying to do, and I'm tired.  Tuesday:   Boring day again, screwed up the Tuba essay that I got back. It was 25% better than my first essay [improvement] but nothing to be proud of since it's still a low mark. I'm kind of confused for Eng20B, some people say that Fahlman is teaching IB and others say Tuba. So which one is it???   Shanahan has been cracking down on people who are not paying attention or skipping class recently. During French, she keeps on telling Raia or Irfan to be quiet, and Kyle to put the cards away, haha. For Comm, she locks everybody out if they are late. Oh and she spazzed at Jon Le a few times too.   Shanahan: PUT THE ORGAMI AWAY! Jon: But I'm almost finished... Shanahan: I don't care, put it away now! Jon: I'll make you one. ...spazz spazz spazz...  I think I also screwed up on the co-ordinate geometry math test today, kinda hard. I finished everything but I didn't get two questions. I tried so he might give me some marks for that; I should also go beg him for 'sympathy' marks if I do poorly on it.

      Finally! The weekend has started. I gotta get used to this 5 school day week again, I had 3 day weeks for the past 2 weeks. Really tired today, sleepy [5 hours of sleep everyday for the past 4 days], unfortunately, I still have to work tomorow and finals are coming up in one and a half weeks. I must find some time to study this week or I'm screwed. Chem quiz and lab for monday, math test tuesday, chem test thursday!!! So much studying and hw to do. I decided to waste today in order to get some rest. My dad taught me how to grill steak but I still suck at it. I 'cooked' it really rare. Heh, I gotta practice on my steak cooking skills over the summer.   I also went to Galaxyland for the Rock+Ride with some friends today at 9pm. Didn't stay too long though, the people there are so impolite, annoying, and rude. They don't care about walking around you, they just walk into you, and they don't even apologize. They just say "f**k off" or "move you asshole", etc. Geez, my friends and I felt like punching them in the face!!! We almost got into a fight when some Native Americans walked up to us, and laughed at us because my friends were white: "Hahaha, you guys suck because you're white." That's what they said, my friends felt offended, and they should be. We didn't do anything to provoke them, I was insulted because they just counted me as a 'white man' because I was with them. I don't get these kind of people, they do nothing but look for trouble, and they got some. Soon, they were pushing us, some police officers patrolling Galaxyland took them away for doing that. Heh, they deserved it. And I think some Galaxyland worker got beaten up by some dumb teens. Yeah, Galaxyland is chaotic on Fridays, NEVER GO TO ROCK+RIDE!!! You'll regret it.

      HELL YESSSSSS!!! Summer school is finally over!!! Here's my activities for the last few days...  Thursday:  Went out to lunch with my parents at some Vietnamese noodle house after summer school. Good food. Went to futureshop to order my new computer and get it upgraded so I can bring it home on friday. It was around 6:30pm after computer shopping so we decided to go out to BP for supper, hehe.  HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY JORDAN!  Friday:  Summer school is over! Went out for Dim Sum at Mirama near Chinatown. After lunch, I was stuck with my parents for 4 hours... They had some stuff to do in downtown. After that business, we finally went to futureshop to pick up my new computer... I got home and installed my new computer and I had supper after that.  I'm so tired... English final finished today and I had a extremely boring afternoon but I'm happy that I got my new computer and that summer school is finally over!  Saturday:  Going to work today from 12pm-8:30pm again. Boring day... But tomorow, I will probably be going to the Heritage Days with Matt and then to Jordan's birthday party!  Summer starts NOW! o.O

      Three more days till summer school is over!!!  I haven't done much today. I don't want to study, I don't want to watch TV, I don't really want to do anything... But after summer school finishes, I want to finally relax and enjoy summer.   Summer school is really a pain in the ass now. The days seem to be slowing down in the last week. I'm studying poetry in summer school for the last week. The poems that we learn are so boring. Today, I fell asleep for half an hour, the teacher didn't catch me though. I don't think he cares because of my high marks, haha. There's just three more days left... then I can relax and do anything I want for the rest of this summer.   Even though the school year starts again in a bit more than a month, I don't really want to think about it... My plans for this weekend are set: I'm going to watch a movie with Vlad on Friday, get a new computer, and go to Dim-sum with my family after the english final. I will be working on saturday. On sunday, I will probably go for a long bikeride or do somethings with friends.  Summer is almost within reach... I can almost taste it!

I wasn't bored at all since there was somebody else too working with me so we get to talk. I just finished supper, and I plan to watch some TV and go to bed early. This weekend was tiring.

      K-DAYS!!!  Yes, the Klondike Days. Jody and I went at 11am, and Matt caught up with us at 1pm. Twas fun. We walked around and enjoyed the fun and excitement. We went on 2 rides, the Ferris Wheel twice and the Drop of Fear, DUN DUN DUN! Haha, I wasn't afraid of the Drop of Fear but Jody and Matt were scared out of their skull. Especially Matt since he's afraid of heights. Lol. He claims that he has conquered his fear but&nbsp;I doubt it. Although the Mindbender at Galaxyland isn't that high, he's still afraid to go on it. XP. There were so many OSA people there... We saw Mike and Sam, Billy and Hinz, and Steven. There were a few more, but we didn't see them. It was hot today and we were waiting for 40 mins to get on the Drop of Fear, crazy stuff. Anyways, I got back around 6pm and now I'm just resting because I'm kind of tired, heh. Tomorow, I have an early piano lesson in the morning and then I'm off to work till 6:30pm.

      I will be so busy this weekend... Today, I went computer shopping after school with my dad. I desperately require a new computer. My Celeron computer right now can do crap! It's so useless. I will be getting a new computer sometimes next week, a much better one. HA MATT, NO CELERON!!! I will give my Celeron to my brother to fool around with. Hehe, although he doesn't really know how to use a computer, he will eventually figger it out himself. I will be getting: P4 3.0Ghz HT and 1MB of L2 cache, 1GB DDR400 RAM, 120GB HD, either a 128MB FX5900XT or 128MB Radeon 9800Pro, and a 8X DVD-RW. From now on, I will be getting a new computer every 2 years. In the evening, I went biking with a friend and then to his house. We watched "Along Came Polly". Tomorow, I will be&nbsp; going to the Klondike days with Matt and Jody. Heh, K-days should be fun. I haven't gone for two years. I will be working on sunday... Yep, this is my plan for this weekend. Not bad, eh? It's better than staying home.

      I've really been wasting my summer. For today, I've really done nothing productive! I just watch TV, go on msn, or take a nap... Nothing much, eh? Oh right... I have 2 tests tomorow but I haven't studied yet... Bleh bleh bleh... I should have studied in the afternoon but I was too lazy. Not a bad idea to study now for an hour or so. It's just an essay and a unit final on Macbeth. Next week is the last week of summer school!!! Only a poetry test and a final exam. After that, I'm all finished, and summer really starts with work at Galaxyland. I'm not looking forward to that... This years summer is kinda boring. Next year will sure be better. Oh btw, I've decided not to go back to China&nbsp;in august. Way too short. I have like 12 places to go to in less then a month. That would be hectic. My dad wants to give me a tour of China... so I will go next year for the whole summer... Must go to: Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka in Japan; Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Honkyland, Zhuhai, Macao, and Guiyang in China. So many places even for the whole summer. I will probably cut off some destinations in China. Some of these cities are in the middle of no where!

      I am feeling extremely lazy today. Instead of going for a bike ride in the afternoon, I stayed home, took a nap and watched some TV. It was only after supper that I decided to bring my brother and a few of his friends to Galaxyland because they wanted to go. So I watched them go on the rides for most of the evening. Yeah, it's a pretty boring day. I haven't got anything done and I still have&nbsp;a bit of homework to do. I'll probably end up doing my homework in bed as usual. Haha, everyday I allocate my time from 10:30pm-12:00am doing homework in bed. Summer school is pretty easy right now, there's not as much stress as I expected. Two test per week, but they are easy. I don't understand why the people there still fail or get low marks while&nbsp;I'm hitting the 90's. [probably thanks to Tuba's tough HL IB course] Anyways, I'm going to go outside and take a walk. Later, amigos.

      Animethon is over, hehe. I'm glad I didn't spend too much money... Sorry Phillis, there's no Rei or Takuto, they said it wasn't popular enough to be sold. I only bought a Hikki CD, jpop! Riphays spent like $85 buying CD's and DVD's. Michele and Sam spent quite a bit compared to me. Mike Z. was there too&nbsp;but I wasn't with him for very long. Anyways, it's the last day of the weekend.  :( I have to go to a piano lesson in like 40 min... After that, I'm debating whether I should go to work today. Although I don't have a shift, my supervisor said that I can just drop in for a shift. If I decide not to work, I'll probably watch a movie or something.

      Friday: &nbsp; Yes, the weeks over!!! English 20 is so friggin easy. 91% on my essay. Haha. XD. I shouldn't feel so proud of myself since the teacher is easy, unlike Tuba. I can't believe the class average is only 61%, that's really low... And half the english term is over!!!  &nbsp; Saturday: &nbsp; Animethon??? YES, YES, YES... I'll be leaving in like 15 min. I'm probably going for the whole day with Riphay, Michele, and Samantha. Heh, I'm kinda sleepy right now... Zzzzzzz...

      Hmm... let's see what I did over the past few days...  Sunday:  Piano lesson in the morning. In the afternoon, Jordan and I went to Galaxyland. He wanted to go on some rides. I dragged him on the bender, haha, he was soooooooo scared. His scream killed my ears; they are the worst I've ever heard. After Galaxyland, we found out that the mall was flooding because of the big thunderstorm. The Ice Rink and the nearby areas were all flooded. Galaxyland had a small gap in it's roof, so that caused some flooding. There was a rumour that the roof of Radioshack collapsed. Oh, and Sportchek was also affected, there was a small waterfall directly overhead of the clothes racks. I got my dad to pick me up, but that took around an hour and a half... Jordan and I were waiting at T&T. The Whytemud was flooded, so Jordan's mom couldn't pick him up at my place till like 7. Tis a bad day...  Monday:  Boring summer school. Bike ride with Riphay to the Mall, Futureshop, Home Depot, Sportsmart, and Chapters...  Tuesday:  Boring day............................................................

      Saturday  I took care of some problems that a friend had in the morning. Big wedding party! It was pretty fun, and I unexpectedly saw Julia and her family there, too! It was the third wedding that I attended. My elementry french teachers (moms friend too and a neighbour) daughter got married. Rosella and Alessandro... such a sweet couple... Anyways, the wedding party was pretty fun, we got served a 5 course meal! Haha, I also drank a few sips of wine, champagne, and some cola and coffee. I was expected to stay till like 2 or 3 in the morning, but my family left at around midnight since my brother was tired. I also had a piano lesson early in the morning on the next day.   Sunday  Don't remember doing much today. Piano lesson in the morning... MSN and TV for the rest of the day.  Monday  First day of my English 20 summer school. It is really boring... I also have like an essay and a unit final every friday. I hope this course won't be too stressful, but it probably will since I have to learn a full year course in only a month!  Tuesday  Summer school in the morning and stayed at home for the rest of the day... Soooooo bored... This is probably going to be my routine for the rest of the month. Damn fun and exciting, eh? *rolls eyes*

      Shit, I took a shower outside. GOTTA HATE THIS WEATHER!!! I took a walk to Safeway area, which is like a few km from my house. As soon as I got there, the rain started pouring. I thought it wouldn't be so bad, so I headed home, but after like 3 min, it was raining pretty heavily. I had like half of my shirt wet. I called home for a pickup, but the line was busy. So I had to jog back in really really heavy rain. When I got home like 20 min later, I was completely WET!!! Sooooo cooooldd... I hope I don't get sick... got a wedding attend tomorow.

      Haha, I had to run Spaceshot Photo today, and those 2 girls wearing the miniskirts came back and wanted to buy another picture. The 'suspicious-looking' man that I mentioned yesterday came back again. Apparently, my supervisor and some co-workers told me that this is the fifth day in a row that he's been coming, it's really scary. The man looks like a stalker.

      Friday:  Went out to the mall with a friend. After that, my mom made me go clothes shopping... ugh... Can't remember what I did in the evening. Probably computer and TV. The only thing that I know is that I slept really late. Probably 2 or 3 in the morning...  Saturday:  Slept in today till about 10. Went to work and I earned $30 of commision! Oh right... I remember what I did on Friday, I watched  The Girl Next Door . I know it's 18A, haha. There's some nudity in it but whatever... It has a good plot! Planning to sleep late again tonight, probably playing games or watching some Taiwanese TV series that my friend lent to me. Tis good!

Thursday:  Since my work finished at 4, I walked around in the mall for a while and then went out for some fast food with my family and my brother's friends.  Friday:  Got plans for a friend already.

      Jordan's birthday party today was pretty fun. We played two games at Laserquest. I placed 4th and 3rd, not bad. In the last five minutes of the second game, Mike and I were just facing off and shooting each other, haha. The game was kind of tiring, we all sweated a lot. After that, we went to Jordan's place to play HALO on his Xbox, have a pizza supper, watched Cruel Intentions 2 and played some Jenga.  Cruel Intentions 2 is such a screwed up movie. There's like sex jokes or nudity every few minutes and the plot was so twisted and messed up... If you have nothing to do or if you want to screw up your mind, I suggest you watch the movie, haha. Don't blame me if your mind gets corrupted.  Jenga was pretty fun too. All the truths and dares, hehe.  I plan to take a long walk later until midnight or something...
