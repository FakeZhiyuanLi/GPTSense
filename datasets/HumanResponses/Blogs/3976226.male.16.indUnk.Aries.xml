      In true passion, one does not need a head or brain: The whole body is turned into a montage. This loss of the body, This dissolution of the body into a composite of organs, is called happiness.

      The first lesson of LoVe to be learned: Do not look into each others's eyes! Only by ignoring each&nbsp; other can a couple learn to endure each other and, eventually , to become aware of the other's proximity

      Mood: (freaked out, insecure, neurotic, and emotional)  Music: None  Movie on TV: Legally Blond  ====================   Today, I had the scariest experience of my life, I got in a wreck sorta.&nbsp; I was backing out of my driveway parking spot and&nbsp;I shifted into reverse and&nbsp;I started to move and I must have bumped the shifter into neutral and I rolled forward so I gave it more gas, which should have made it go back but instead it went forward, and I hit the retaining wall, hit the fence, and hit the tree.&nbsp; I bent my frame of my car and dented the bumper. And it was all an accident   That's a Rap!!

      Mood: Awsome (Just got off the phone with my baby)  Music: None  Game: Shadow Ops: Red Mercury  &nbsp;  ================ &nbsp;  Here is the deal, I was staying at my sisters house because my parents were out of town.  I pretty much had free rane on everthing, so i went to one of my friends house's, and we  hung out.&nbsp; At her house she lives with 3 other teenagers, so there are no adults, my parents dont like this.&nbsp; They said they grounded me because i went to her house, without permission but i think the real reason is that, they beleived i had done something morally wrong with  her.&nbsp; But the fact of the matter is that her and i act like brother and sister, we fight like brother and sister.&nbsp; So i came back with my hair all messed up my shirt sorta unbuttoned, the only reason i was like that was because we wrestled. And the only other thing besides that was watching Texas Chainsaw Mas. While watching this movie, i picked up a pillow and hit  her in the face randomly and then we wrestled for like an hour. My parents found out  through my sister and now after nothing happened i get  GROUNDED  and i cant do  anything.&nbsp; So what do u think?? Is life fair??  &nbsp;  Thats a Rap!!

      The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  &nbsp; This is a very good movie.&nbsp; The story is true, and the acting in the movie is extremely good.&nbsp; The only thinks that are bad it the gruesomeness of the story and the ending.&nbsp; In watching this movie u realize how fragile human life is and how sick teh f**k**g world is becomming.&nbsp; I suggest everyone go see this movie. For all those scared by movies like this make sure u watch it during the day. &nbsp; Thats a rap!!

       If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.  When I heard that trees grow a new "ring" for each year they live, I thought, we humans are kind of like that: we grow a new layer of skin each year, and after many years we are thick and unwieldy from all our skin layers.  In weightlifting, I don't think sudden, uncontrolled urination should automatically disqualify you.  If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did.  If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.  Once, when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you know." He started telling his story, about the treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is getting long." But then, the story was over, and I said to myself: "You know, that story wasn't too long after all." I forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on the plane. It was a little long, though.  That's a Rap!!!
