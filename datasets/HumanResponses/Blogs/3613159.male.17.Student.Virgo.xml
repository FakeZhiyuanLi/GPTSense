      I've seen people that I hadn't seen in a long time. Britney. A guy who knew me only by pictures he'd seen 4 years ago. pages to fill.

      Music: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind shoundtrack  yesterday was good. I woke early. Jumped onto a bus. Jumped onto a train. Jumped into my shoes and walked around downtown. I saw coffee and cigarettes (by myself) and enjoyed most of the film. Highlights definitely being "Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil" and the one with Rza, Gza and Bill Murray. The theatre began shaking about half way into the picture and I first assumed the bass was extremely good but soon realized that it was an earthquake. So strange how the earth rebels beneath us and we can do nothing to stop it.

      Music: Magnetic Fields/The Charm of the Highway Strip  I forced myself out of bed early this morning. I suppose I thought that this simple action would force me to do something productive with my daylight hours. The theory was partially correct. Though I did not find a job I did spend a lot of time with my little brother which is always a productive use of my life. I also went to the beach and played with sea anemenes. Later I went to a "variety shop" where I purchased some contraband. Tomorrow. It will all happen tomorrow.

      Prepare your shoes not to  come back soon, prepare  your heart not to stop too  soon. You cannot walk with  us. One step inside doesn't  mean you understand, one  step inside doesn't mean I'm  yours. In your world my  feet are out of step, my  arms don't move, my hand  won't grab. I will never read   your stupid map, so don't  call me incomplete, you are  the freak.

      I saw the Hairy Potter and I didn't enjoy. Niether did my 3 year old brother who slamed his head into the theatre cushion for the majority of the feature. I also bought some shoes today. woope.

      Music: The Smiths/Hateful of Hollow   Two things to get excited about today. The first is "Audioblogging" which is a new way for me to look like a complete dork. The second is the zine I'll be woring on this summer. I'm not quite set on a title. Two options are "Stay Free" and "One of These Days." I suppose that they might be horrible but I'll have fun writing them and trying to get people to read them. Other than that I have an early morning headache and everyone has vanished from my house. I wish my dad played the trumpet.

      Its definetly summer in my room. The clock says 11:02 pm yet, its around 80 degrees in here. I tried to teach my brother how to play guitar tonight with mixed results. However, he seems to have a real desire to play because he sits with the thing in his lap and awkwardly brushes the strings with a determined look in his eye. Cooked dinner for the kids as well. What a night. What a life.

      I'm writing thank you notes today and searching ebay for a typewriter. Listening to Figure 8 for the first time in quite a while. It is truly a taxing experiance. I love my magazines. I read an article about the color khaki and another about "lists" in the quarterly Magazine Cabinet. the writing is amazing and it came with a cd of random sounds. I'm hooked.

      My summer lays ahead of me like some sort of khaki colored desert or one of those bruised sunset skies I've been hearing so much about lately. I'd like to do two things. READ and make music. I think 25 books is a reasonable goal for these three eclectic months. The latter requires me to buy some equipment. EBAY...
