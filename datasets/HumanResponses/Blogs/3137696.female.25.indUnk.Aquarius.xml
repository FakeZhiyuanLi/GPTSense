      Okay, remember yesterday when I said there weren't that many cicadas here?  Well, God must have been laughing at me the whole time I was bragging on my blog because yesterday afternoon when I took my niece out shopping I was totally almost attacked by these awful bugs!  I can just see it now, God sitting up there laughing at me while I was trying my best to dodge these bugs and not get any on me.  It was so awful I don't think I am ever gonna go out of the house again!  I will stay inside until  urlLink they  go away!

      I am not sure if you all know about these lovely little bugs or not.  All I know is that I really don't like them.  In fact, I don't like bugs at all.  Thankfully, they aren't that many of them here, but believe me, there are enough.  If they were any worse I do not think I would be going out much.  Anyway, if you don't know about these little bugs check out this  urlLink site

      I thought I would post today about how truly blessed I am.  It has just been a great weekend of blessings for me.    First off, I forgave one of my friends that needed me to forgive him and I realized that I can never stay mad at him. I also realized how truly blessed I am to have him in my life.  Now, if we could just ever meet I would be even more blessed. ;-)  Love ya!   Also, I feel so blessed to have my wonderful family!  I truly do not know where I would be without their love and support.  Sometimes things can get a little crazy with all of the nieces, nephews and sisters here but I still love them just the same!  My family rocks!    Today was just a great end to my wonderful and blessed weekend.  I got to spend time worshipping God today!  I love worshipping God!!  Woo hoo!  I learned in church today what my SHAPE was.  And to think all this time I thought I was just round and plump.  I was totally wrong!  God is so awesome!!   Tonight my friend Amanda and her Mom stopped by for a surprise visit.  It was soo great to see them again.  I have not seen them in what feels like forever.  It was great to see them again!  They need to come back and visit more often.  I love seeing friends again!    I totally had an awesome weekend!  Praise God!!  He is the BEST!

      It doesn't take much for my heart to break and you have done it for what seems the millionth time...  It doesn't take much for me to shed a tear and you have done so many things to make me cry...  I am tired of having a broken heart and crying.  Maybe one day it will change.

      Well, today was one of those days that I just felt kind of  BLAH.  I can't really describe the day other than that.  Just BLAH.  That's still how I feel tonight.  I don't know, why don't things ever work out the way you plan them to?  I guess God has other plans for us sometimes.  Oh well. Hopefully the next time I post I will feel better than just BLAH.

      Hello again everyone.  I had some blog complications last week and lost my whole blog but never fear, I am back with a new blog.  I just don't think I like this html stuff.  Maybe one day I will figure it out.  Who knows?    Anyway, not really much excitement in Kentucky this weekend.  Same ole boring stuff.  If anyone wants to come and visit, feel free.  :-)   The only exciting thing I did was go to the tanning bed and get burned.  How fun is that?    Oh well... more blogs to come if I don't delete it again.

      "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but what is unseen.  For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."                                                           2 Corinthians 4:18  I can't wait to see the unseen one day!

      In my old age, 25, which is almost 30, I have been struggling with finding my purpose in life.  I visited my sister's church a couple of weeks ago and the sermon series was based on "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren.  So, I got the book and have been reading it.  I have to say that I am really enjoying it so far.  If you haven't read it I recommend that you do.  I think we all struggle sometimes with finding our purpose and this  urlLink book  is a good guide to showing us how God has a purpose for all of us.

      I came across this story and thought I would share it with all of you.  Sometimes we forget that we can do nothing without God in our lives.  Enjoy!  I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. Galatians 2:20  One day I had some work to do around the house so I went to the store and bought some work gloves. I don't know why they call them work gloves -- they don't do any work. Look at them...they are flat and lifeless. What do you think it will take to get these gloves to do any work? That's right! I have to put my hands inside the gloves. They won't do a thing until I put my hand inside them.  Once I put my hand in the work gloves, they can do all sorts of things. They can hammer nails, rake leaves, and hoe in the garden. They can open doors and lift and carry all kinds of heavy objects. As you know, of course, it isn't the gloves that are doing the work. It is my hands inside the gloves that are doing the work.  You know, that is the same way it is with being a Christian. The apostle Paul explained it this way, "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."  Sometimes we may start thinking that we do some pretty great things. We may brag about how many people we have told about Jesus or we might tell everybody about how much work we do around the church. We might say, "Look at me. I do this and I do that, I, I, I..."  Ay! Ay! Ay! We have it all wrong! "It is not I, but Christ who lives in me."  The next time you start to thinking that you have done something great, remember the work gloves. They can do nothing without a hand inside. You and I can do nothing without Christ inside.  Dear Jesus, help us to remember that apart from you, we can do nothing. Amen.

      I have been really bad about posting lately.  I feel like it has been forever.  I didn't fall off the face of the earth though, just in case any of you were wondering.  :-)  I have just been real busy.  A lot goes on around my house when all my nieces and nephews are out of school.   Not really much to post about though.  I have found a new favorite drink.  I am really addicted to Starbucks frappuccino.  I tried to find a picture of it to post but I didn't have any luck.  I never was really much of a coffee drinker but I am seriously addicted to these drinks.  They are so good!  If you haven't tried one you definitely should.    More to come if anything exciting happens...!

      Well, schools are out here in Kentucky and that only means one thing...my niece Rachel has officially moved in for the summer.  She does everything with me.  I enjoy it though.  She is fun to hang out with.   So, that is really all that is going on here with me.  Not much else to post about tonight but stay tuned, I am sure there will be more to come!

       Well, as you can see, I have given my blog a facelift.&nbsp; Thought it was time for a change.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am off to a family&nbsp;reunion this weekend.&nbsp; I will be leaving for the much dreaded venture tomorrow evening.&nbsp; The big event is Saturday.&nbsp; Wish me luck!&nbsp; The first question I am bombarded with every year never changes..."Do you have a boyfriend?"&nbsp; Sometimes I just want to scream after the 50,000th person asks me that!&nbsp; Ugh...&nbsp; is it really so bad that I don't have a boyfriend?&nbsp; Well, to be honest some days it is and some days it isn't.&nbsp; I just wonder sometimes what being in a serious relationship would be like.&nbsp; Maybe one day I will find out.&nbsp; I'll be posting sometime after I get&nbsp; back to let you know how I survived this years reunion and all the endless questions!&nbsp;

      I promised my nieces that I would take them to the movies today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are off to see  urlLink Catwoman  kick some butt.&nbsp; Correct me if I am wrong here, but wasn't Catwoman's real name Selena Kyle?&nbsp; In the movie summary it says that her name is Patience Philips.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; I guess I thought it was based on the comic book character.&nbsp; Maybe not. &nbsp; We shall see how the movie is in a few hours and I'll let you know my honest opinion.&nbsp; :-)  Stayed tuned!!

      I am in a silly mood today.  Perhaps it is because of the lack of sleep I received last night, but who knows!    Is it just me or does the lead singer of Mercy Me look like our good buddy Jimmy?    Take a look for yourself!    Guy from  urlLink MERCY ME                                     AND Our buddy  urlLink JIMMY LEWIS   So.. what do you think?  Leave your comments!

      I don't know if any of you have heard the song "Jesus Walks" by Kanye West but I have to say that I am really liking it.    Thought I would post some of the lyrics here... (Jesus Walks) God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down (Jesus Walks with me) The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now (Jesus Walks) And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs (Jesus Walks with me) I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long  And one of my favorite lines in the song is this:   The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus!    So, remember today...We ALL need Jesus to walk with us!

      Well, I have been thinking a lot lately about my single status and I have decided that I really don't like it anymore.  I just want to know what it feels like to be in love with someone of the opposite sex. I know what you are thinking, how sad is it that a 25-year old has never been in love, but yes, it is true.    Sometimes I am content with my single life and then other times I really want to experience the dating life too and maybe even marriage.  I know that God has a purpose for my life and if He chooses for me to be single then so be it, but if He wants me to meet someone and enjoy the dating life there will be no complaints from me. :-)   So, any single guys out there, I am taking applications for the perfect date.  haha  Feel free to email me your application.

      I know that I have been bad about posting lately but I thought I would finally  update you about everything that has been going on.   Well, actually this years family reunion wasn't too bad.  I didn't even get asked the famous question this year...what a shock but you won't hear me complaining.  I guess my family finally figured out how pathetic I am year after year and didn't want to waste their time or breath anymore by asking me if I had a boyfriend yet.  Oh well.  Such is life... but they did notice that I had lost 20 pounds! Woo hoo!!   I am on the job hunt again. I have not been getting much work with the transcription stuff anymore so I am putting in some applications at various places.  I think I am gonna stick with child care since that seems to be the only thing I am good at.   I am just at this place right now in my life where I am trying to figure out lots of stuff.  I know that I need a job and I need to really save up for a place of my own.  I love my family, don't get me wrong, but there comes a time when we all need to be on our own.  I am ready for that now.  My parents are getting older, which scares me to death, and I know they won't be around forever.  I really don't even like to think about that though.... I don't even know what I would do without them, especially my Mom, she is my best friend and the ONLY person, besides God, that I can go to and talk to about anything.   Okay, enough rambling now... I'll post more soon...
