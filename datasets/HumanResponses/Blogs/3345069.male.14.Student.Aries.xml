      Only 12 more day that we have to get up to go to school. This should go by really quickly. I am also excited about high school and playing freshman football and running track in the spring. Good luck to all the other new freshman.

      Early last week, our class picked stocks to use in an expierement. I am happy to announce that my stock ANF, Abercrombie and Fitch Co., has gone up from $33.90 to about $34.85, which is a 2.80% rise.

      I have many plans for the summer. This July I going to be on a two week roadtrip through Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and Missouri. On top of that I think I have a good chance at scoring some good tickets for some upcoming concerts. When I'm not traveling or going to a concert I hope to hang out with old friends, that I haven't seen in quite some time. Also I am now able to get a job with a work permit so I will have some extra cash. I think this will be a summer to remember.

      Well I really don't have much of interest to post. Although I am pretty excited about the Chicago Cubs finally turning it around. As of now they have won their last four games after sweeping the Padres over the weekend. Hopefully this will continue for the rest of the season, which seems to be going by pretty fast with 35 of 162 games played. Hopefully Mark Prior and Gonzo can get back soon, to really make the Cubs unstopable. I think that's all for now, but you can visit  urlLink www.cubs.com  if you are interested in the Cubs.

      Under Favorite Music in my profile the bands stop at G which is weird. This is just because I have too many bands and it won't let me post them all, I'll try to get it cleared up. Either that or I'm gonna have to shorten my list of favorite bands, which I really don't want to do!!!

      I cannot believe that the English teachers at Maine West have the nerve to give the English Acc. class homework over our summer break. We have to read, annotate, and write an essay about The Diary of Anne Frank, a 352 page book. Makes me wonder, if this is summer work, what the heck are we going to do during the year.

      I finally graduated eighth grade. It wasn't actually as bad as i thought it would be, although it was really really hot from all the lights on the stage. I'm excited because in about three months I'll be in high school, which I hope is as good as middle school was.

      The new satelite TV is awesome. We now get like 127 channels plus like 1000 public interest and music only channels. The only bad part is there is a 3 second pause before the actual program comes on.

      Tommorow the satelite company guys are coming to install the satelite tv. This will increase the channels of mindless crap to 126. Still bored out of my mind, nothing much to do. Oh ya, Anne Frank's diary is just the same old crap over and over. She's annoying, I get it. I still can't believe we got an assignment over summer, but I guess its better than sitting around doing nothing. Life is crap!

      Well turns out that my summer vacation is two weeks later than I thought, meaning it is right during the middle of football camp, so I can't go to football camp this summer. And my summer is turning out crappy so far. I'm dying of boredom.

Uh,yuh,yuh,ya  Grasping to CONTROL So I BETTER hold on  Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm CRACKING UP Am I just PARANOID? Or am I just STONED  This song is awesome, but then again so is most of the stuff by Green Day

      I officially hate every single liberal minded ass. One of these retards happens to be Michael Moore. He has skewed the facts of why the Iraq and Afghanistan war really happened. He said the only reason the war was happening was for a pipeline. To this day a pipeline benfiting the United States has not been built. Want proof? If a pipeline had been built my parents wouldn't still be paying 2.50 for gas. Second, he thinks that his opinion is the right one which is entirely not true. He thinks he, a director with little education in politics or the economy, knows more than the entire Bush Administration, which is a group of men and women that have earned degrees from greatly respected colleges and universities, and are experts in what they are doing. Finally, he says he does not feel any safer now than he did before the war. How could this be true when the United States Armed forces have killed tens of thousands of terrorists, and wounded and captured many many more. And in fact terrorist attacks have dropped from nearly 400 when Bush came to office, to just half that amount last year.  Next topic, the economy. Democrats have attacked Bush and claimed that he has damaged the economy beyond repair. How can this be true when all the economic problems started in Clinton's last month in office. Bush inherited a horrible economic situation and fixed it as best any president would be able to.  Sorry about this, I just needed a place to rant and rave, and I thought this was a good place. These are just my judgements. You should not blindly believe everthing you see or hear. Always research the subject, get both points of view and then make a decision. Dindn't expect to hear this much about politics from a fourteen year old did you?

      Visit  urlLink here  for the full story. But basically a man in Oslo, Norway walked into a McDonalds, dressed as Ronald McDonald and started yelling about how he disapproved of McDonalds policies. He was asked to leave, he refused. He was then arrested in front of all of the people eating there which included children. Its a sad world we live in, I mean someone tried to impersonate a clown. I think that's as low as you can go. But it made for a funny story. LOL

      There is nothing to do here. Im not exagerating. No one is home so, I can't get a ride to go anywhere, no one is on AIM, and I'm sick and tired of my video and computer games. I hope to God that someone signs on or my parents get home so I can go somewhere, otherwise I'm gonna have to start reading that piece of crap they call Anne Frank's Diary.

      SpiderMan2 the game is definately one of the best video games in a long while. It has nearly no load times when you enter or exit a building, which is amazing, not to mention a time saver. And it's so complicated, I mean I've played it for just over 4 hours and I've only finished 19% of the game. Another good thing is in the game there are chanlenges, so even after I finish the story I'll still have something to do for a long time. This is definately a good game, nearly as good as Vice City, which has awesome cars and tanks and stuff.
