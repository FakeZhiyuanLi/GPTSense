      Well, I would say that I don't think things could get worse, but if I do I'm sure they will.  This last year and a half has been the hardest of my life.  I've dealt with lumps in my breast and the resulting biopsy.  Then my car has been hit 3 times.  None of them my fault.  No really major damage, just a lot of irritation.  Then April 4 last year, someone broke into my house and raped me at gun point.  Since then things have been really difficult.  I have Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.  Not a lot of fun.  But I am in therapy - one of the best decisions of my life.    Unfortunately, the rape has had some major effects on my life, most of them not good. I've had trouble dealing with changes. Unfortunately there have been a lot.  Most in the last month or so.  In that time, I've lost my boyfriend.  I loved him dearly, but things just didn't work out so he moved out and back with his family.    Now, because of everything, I have to move in my job as well.  Some have issues with me because of my reaction to things. So I have to move to a new area, with all new people.  People that I don't know and don't know me.  The staff I worked with knew the jist of what happend to me.  The accepted and supported me.  Now I have to start over.  I have to explain the many absences for therapy and med checks.  I have to explain the PTSD.  I have to explain that if I have a panic attack that it's ok, it will pass.  I just feel like I'm starting at page one again.    But I have come far.  I won't let this stop me.  If I can survive everything else that has happened to me, I can survive this.  As a good friend told me to do, I'm going to look at this as a fresh start. A new chance to get my life back in order and into some semblance of normalcy. Or as normal as I get.  This is a just a step towards getting my life back. It will be good.  It will be positive.  Because I will make it so.    I am stong. I am a survivor.

      Who am I?  I'm a survivor.  I'm a fighter.  I've been abused, called every name in the book, cheated on, raped, and hurt.  But I'm still here.  I'm not letting anyone keep me down. I've gone through the self doubt phase. Still do at times.  I wonder what is wrong with me. Why all these things happen to me.  Why am I being punished.  But I'm coming to realize that it's not me.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I have been victimized, but I am not a victim.  I am a person worthy of love, caring, appreciation. My heart may have been broken, but I will make it.  I will move on.  I will find love and be loved.  I am me.  And I will survive.

      Well, I've had an interesting week. Some good, some bad. Some really bad.  I suppose I'll start with the good.    Last weekend a friend came too see me. They stayed for the long weekend. It was really nice. I had a great time.  Nice relaxing weekend.   We had a lot of fun.  We didn't do anything spectacular, but it was a really good time. At least until Monday. But that needs some back story.  I've had a lot of health problems lately.  I've been really sick to my stomach and nauseous for about a month. I finally went to the doctor.  She said that she thinks it's stress related. Oh yeah.  So she decided to give me some medication to help with the being nauseous.  Well everything was great.  I started it on Friday night.  I was actually feeling much better on the weekend.  I was able to eat real food for the first time in a long time.  Then on Monday, I started to have some problems.  My face started to twitch. I couldn't control what was going on. Then my jaw started spasming.  I was having trouble actually working my mouth.  Well I though it would just go away. But it didn't.  It started to get worse.  So we decided that I needed to go to the doctor. Well, no place was open because it was Memorial Day.  So it was decided that I would probably have to go to the hospital.  My friend decided to head home so I could do what I needed to.  I knew they needed to go and didn't want them stuck with me at the hospital and be late getting home. I called another friend and asked them to go to the hospital with me. By they time they got to my house, my jaw was feeling better. So I decided not to go right away.  A little later, the problem came back and got a lot worse. I couldn't open my mouth and was in a lot of pain.  So off I go to the ER.  Sometimes I wonder about the people working at the ER.  I had like 5 people ask me the same questions.  It was pretty obvious what was wrong with me.  And talking made the pain a lot worse.  Finally, they decided that I'm allergic to the medication and that I shouldn't take it anymore.  The pumped me up with some drugs. My jaw finally went back to normal, except it was really achy.  I finally get to go home. I made a couple calls to let people know I was ok and proceeded to fall asleep.  The next day I was really shakey. I got sent home from work.  My stomach was once again really upset.  I then proceeded to throw up for 2 days. I went to the doctor the next day.  She decided that I was definitely allergic to compazine.  She didn't give me anything else for my stomach.  I went home. Threw up some more and slept.  She told me that if I wasn't better in a week or so, that she was going to send me to a GI specialist and have a scope done.   I've actually felt a little better for the past couple days.  I'm really hoping that things stay this way. I haven't been able to eat much, but I'm getting there.   I think this weekend is going to be a stay at home and veg.  I need a nice uneventful weekend.
