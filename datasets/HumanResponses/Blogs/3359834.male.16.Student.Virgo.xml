						   	I say I hate school.  I told my parents that the high school environment isn't conducive to my learning style and I could learn ten times more ten times faster if I was left to do it myself.  Even if I was wrong, and didn't learn anything more about all the shit I'm supposed to learn about --like algebra-- at least I would enjoy myself.  I told mom school was like prison to me, which in retrospect wasn't a good idea because she's a teacher and that "attitude" gets on her nerves.  She was trying extra hard to be patient tonight, I guess. . .   	Hell, school isn't that bad, but it's still pretty fuckin' irritating.  For instance I got yelled at today for looking out the window.  I've got a window seat in math, and I take advantage of it before the seating gets changed next week.  I like the math teacher, but I hate the math.  Not to say I hate math, because I don't; I think all those weird theories and golden ratios and all those things I don't know about sound interesting, and I know you have to start somewhere in order to understand those things, and that somewhere being algebra, but at two in the afternoon on a sunny day, after spending the better part of my morning sitting in desks that were designed with no considerations on comfort, I don't give a shit about math. 	"What's the next answer, Andy?!" that's what the teacher says, or barks, as I'm looking the other way, out the window watching cars go by.  Everyone looks at me, and the prick who's dying to say the answer is trying to tell me-- quiet enough to make it look like he's trying to help me, but loud enough to betray the truth of the situation, which is he needs to make the teacher think he's the smartest little jackass in the class, so he's bent on answering the question even if it wasn't directed to him. 	"I'm hearing F to G," I said (we were doing minimal spanning trees), "but I don't really know." 	"Well the answer isn't in the street! It's in your book, why don't you try paying attention for once?!" 	So I looked in the book because he didn't really want to know why I don't try to pay attention for once.  I get asked a lot of questions no one really wants to hear the answers to.  	I hate being told about "reality."  My dinner table conversation about hating school inevitably warped into the "reality" conversation.  That "life" isn't about doing what you want. (Ostensibly life is about doing whatever someone else wants you to do, which is in turn dictated by some one else, telling someone to tell you what to do.  It would be funny if it weren't true. Life is a big fuckin' joke, that you can't really laugh at because no one else thinks it's supposed to be funny.)  If can't cope with "reality" I'm told, I will be sorry down the line.  I'll be sorry when I can't get into the college I want to get into, my dad says.   Even if I manage to get into a college, I won't be able to get the work done because "I think studying is boring." That's what my parents and other people think I think.  I really hate it when other people tell me what I think.  I know what I think, and if anyone else has enough time to try and conjecture about what I think based on what little they know about me, then I know what they think: not that much.  Empty heads and piles of shit, all you have to do is shovel it in and think you're full. . .  	I've lost track of the point of that last paragraph, so I'm starting a new one.  The irony about reality is, is that it's all silly and made up by the society that simultaneously says it doesn't like it as it keeps it alive and booming.  I'm not complaining really, I'm just sayin'.   If it wasn't there all fucked up and silly, then it wouldn't feel so good to know you realize it for how fucked up and silly it is. 	 	The sun rises over a warm spring morning in picturesque 50s sitcom neighborhood in the Midwest.  Think of Mayfield.  Think of Mayberry.  Think of rows of suburban ranch style homes on tree lined streets.  In one of these perfect homes on this perfect street in this perfect town,  Bob Anderson kisses his wife Viv on the cheek and waves goodbye to little Johnny at the kitchen table. Little Johnny, still in his pajamas, his blond hair still messed from bed, eating his pancakes.  Viv, smiling in a pink and white polka dot sundress. 5’ 5”, 35-22-35.  What a perfect family. He lays his jacket in the crook of his elbow, slaps his hat on and picks up his briefcase.  He turns towards the door, smiling at the sound of his shoes squeaking on the new linoleum floor.  He steps out the door in perfect timing to see his retired neighbor Mr. Johnson letting out his little terrier, Sparky (or was it Fido?), to get the morning paper.  Mr. Johnson stands in his robe, coffee mug in hand, smiling "good morning" to Bob, as always.  	"How's life Bob?!" calls Mr. Johnson cordially 	"Pretty fucked up and silly!" 	Mr. Johnson chuckles.  This is perfectly normal, everything is perfectly normal.  "I'd say so! Have a good day, Bob!" 	"You too Mr. Johnson!" Bob says as he steps into his shiny red '51 Studebaker four door sedan and prepares for another day at the office.  This is perfectly normal, everything is perfectly normal. Don’t ask me what it means, I just wrote it.

						   I will be surprised if anyone sees this.  How would anyone happen see it anyway?  If you some how end up here, e-mail me and tell how you got here, I'd be curious. I'm trying to think of something eyecatching and interesting to say that would make some random person just curious enough to read a little more, is it working?  I hope so.  This makes me think of messages in a bottle.  Writing a little something and tossing it into the ocean of information.  "To who it may concern:..."  I'm wondering what will come of it, and halfway thinking of just forgetting it.  If you've read this far, you should definately e-mail me just for kicks, it'll make my day.
