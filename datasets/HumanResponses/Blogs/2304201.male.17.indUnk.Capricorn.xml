      Life is OK. It seems no matter how many events are smashed into one day, I can never decide whether it was good or bad. Example: yesterday was pretty good. I got alot of work done, and after waiting for a while, got to go to the Chicago party at last. That part was great. Also, if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. But as I left to my grandparents house, where I know I don't spend enough time. As I drove down Bamber Valley Road, halfway between the school and the old barn, I looked into my mirror. There was nothing in it except uninhabited, placid darkness. I checked forward again, seeing the lucid glow from a harsh, orangish light at the intersection. Again I looked into the silent dusk. For some reason, looking back, I felt this icy grip on my stomach. There was this feeling that if I went back from this soulless concrete framework, things could finally start working out. I could leave the orderly, uniform rows of houses here and walk into that starry host, where the glow from an iron street lamp won't impede the view. But I knew that I have always loved the city...the history, the elegance, the testament to mankind's will to march in the inevitable parade of progress. I got to my grandparents' house at a little after 11, to find my cousins all gone home, cousins I won't see for at least another few years. I took my coat off, pondering whether I even cared. It was definitely one of the more selfish moments I've had. I talked with my grandma for a while and went to the downstairs room. Drifting off, I heard the orderly, uniform ticks of the antique clocks in the shop. And I thought for a while...how can I ever leave the city, when that is all I've ever known? Why do people spend their whole lives trying to escape that which they are? How can I resist the crisp tick-tock of man's feet, ever walking to the even tempo of progress? As Jerry Garcia said, "Truth is something you stumble into when you think you're going someplace else."

      hmmm now it's been a while...So few events to write about though. OH wait, I forgot about Prince Charles, the Willow Creek social worker. I've been getting many compliments on the old people/church story, so I'm on the lookout for more possibilities. this is the stupidest update I've written. NOw time to go people-watching...

      Shucks I missed updating yesterday...But there wasn't much to say anyway. I despised Kohl's and don't plan to go back. Ever. That was the entire morning. I bought a scarf. I liked it. Went home and slept, played GTA3. Rented another movie. Watched half. Reminisced about "captain morgan-hayes" and such with one of MF's friends. And I went to bed at midnight and went to church this morning. We had breakfast. during a conversation about LINK crew, Julie R. exclaimed "Lucky LINKies! (giggle)" And then I laughed. I wrote an Oedipus paper today...definitely not by best work. Work--I got to go home 2 hours early! WOO HOO! Sad songs are hott with two t's. Oh yeah last night--harrassing Keith and several of his friends! Bethany Thomaier! YES! back to today...actually I think thats it. I like "evaporated" by Ben Folds.  I think that there's a soul somewhere that's leading me around  I wonder if she knows which way is up, and which is down  . Sarah is good at giving advice, and so she is now my hero. Good Night all!

      I took the afternoon off today, because I hate Friday afternoons and I have many papers to write. The Death. So I really like this Rooney CD. After working on register today, I came to the conclusion that I hate my boss. A lot. Also, I missed out on ANOTHER swing dance. Thankfully, we're going to organize one in Florida, hopefully on New Year's Eve. Imagine it, my friends...sigh. Sad times...but good times...what is it going to be like next year? The year when a significant portion of my friends leave? When it will be too late? What then? Why did I go and make friends with all these people who I won't see? And why am I complaining when everyone is faced with this? Satis. I get to thinking late at night, and have to wonder, because I met all these people when I was a freshman, and for three years I've gotten close to them. Now, I don't know what high school will really be like, since I haven't really known it without them. ARGH. And why do these plans of mine always fall apart? Twice now I've made strategic plans that have gone terribly awry, and I can't do anything about them, because now its too late. Whats really weird is that these songs keep coming into my head and they perfectly describe the situations...and they are all eerily the same three songs. Like the song in my last entry. Gosh, too much to think about tonight. I hate it when I sound whiny. But I guess, again, I'm going to deal with it. In closing, the song  Iris , by The Goo Goo Dolls, is a great song and everyone should listen to it. Later.

      Bipolar night. Am I happy or depressed? I don't even know, and it's all about a stupid little thing that doesn't even matter. Screw it, I'm sick of being sad over things i can't control. A song which is eerily reminiscent of the time is Annie Waits... "Annie says, 'You see? This is why I'd rather be alone.' And so, Annie waits, Annie waits, Annie waits for a call from a friend. The same, it's the same, why's it always the same?" ARGH. Somebody call me. On a lighter note, I got the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me today, in note form. And I just want to say, Sarah, in less eloquent terms, everything you wrote to me has made my day infinitely better, and I want you to know you mean that much to me and more. Thank you for being such a good friend. Well... I don't know what else to say tonight, except that band was amazing, and even though people make fun of them sometimes, they have no idea what they're talking about. Too many pronouns. Anyway, I think I may just go and think now...Thinking in progress...

      ugh man. long day today. Sarah and I caught up on gossip during Modern Euro...and TRAVIS KEYED ME. I think he may be depressed, so I fear him doing something crazy. Psych and Algebra have kept me on edge recently...I dont like it. Choir is shaping up, Brendan had the best idea for Halloween next year, and Katie Carr has a new best friend. In English, we talked about starting a new business, inspired by Prof. McCormick, called the "Go to Hell Book and Porn Shoppe"....Funny guy, he is. The slob, Monson, informed me today that i had to do my novel project, except it had a different date on the sheet, and she flipped. So i say screw it. WHy am I still up at 10:45? Oh yeah, they asked if i could work tonight till 10. And I've done no homework. Wow. I am a loser. Ugh thats enough for tonight. Good night to all.

      KWOODY on the pizzaphone! I like lots of alternative bands, not in the "I hate the world" way, but rather quiet, good songs. Ye Yeah. I need to get a photo album or something, because I have a thousand pictures and only 1 album with tiny picture holders. TRAVESTY of TRAVESTIES. TUSKA. Alysson has cyst filled memories, and I seriously represented the Frankish peoples today, with my tribute to the French flag. Do you ever get the feeling you heard a song before, only to find out it was Muzak from a department store? Thats downright shameful. Biology is great. For the second week in a row, we've gotten 10 points just for showing up and staying. I love it, despite hating the subject. Blue Side, by Rooney, is a GOOD SONG. Love it or leave it. I just wrote love three times in four sentences. That is not a good sign. There were definitely some good quotes in Modern Euro today...I learned that to be tough, one has to be like Stalin, that is, utterly  statistic . I shake my head. So nothing else really happened today, except for my continuing revelation that Beck is terrible. UGh. Thats it....IT'S OVER!

      Sitting in English, Megan is way melodaramatic. I am selling ze candy bars...CANDY BARs. So what can you tell me about Oedipus? I'm against it. Also, I've started up a cal-q-lay-der ring. You want 'em, I got 'em. TI-83s, TI-86s, You betcha. Worked on the Great Mung-Feian Epic this morning, be on the lookout for episode III. My favorite number is now  i , despite not knowing what the hell it means. Argghhhh. I had pizza grease on my ear today, because I was calling KWOODY on the pizzaphone. When will she learn? And why can't my star pupil ever do his homework??? He misses the subtleties I guess. Enough for now.

      I really like the song "After Midnight" from  Chicago . As some of you remember, it was the ONLY song on the blockbuster hit known as 1920's Decade Project. Also, "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" has stolen my heart. STINK, SKANK, SKUNK! Huzzah for my fellow southtowners. Speaking of Southtown, Cory and I had quite the chat about it. We agree. Also, TUSKA. TUSKA TUSKA TUSKA! Anyone want to work for me on the 28th at Kohl's for choir? Because it's the biggest shopping day of the year, SANDY won't let anyone request off at work. Curses. Privation is the word. Mr. Schmitz pushed me out of my chair today. Then he tried to break Jill's calculator. I was fearing. KWOODY + LIEBOW! YAY! 30.5/34 on the Algebra quiz, the ALGEBRAIC DREAMTEAM is validated again. You all should join. Or die. The choice is yours. Lunde read my story about Lucretia the Thumbless for the class. I love it. GOOD NEWS!!! No English class at rctc for two weeks in December! Woo hoo! Did somebody say Poojsha, or was that just my Veniki acting up?! UGhhh yeah! Sarah told the friendly salesmen that "you'll all die in your cars", and "why's it gotta be dark?" and "you're all working in a submarine!" It may just be time to go to sleep now. Hail and Farewell.

      so sarah morgenthaler is the coolest person ever.  she's the rhythm of my heart, and i can't wait to marry her.   here is a love song i composed for her.  "every night in my dreams, i see you, i feel you that is how i love you GO ON far across the distance and spaces between us you have come to show me GO ON near, far, wherever you are i believe that my heart will go on once more you've opened the door and you're here and my heart will go on and on."

      Life changing, heart rending moments today...Yeah yeah they seem sappy, but I can't help but feel that this weekend I've learned something. I walked into the 8 o'clock service, usually one frequented by the elderly, and sat in back, next to a couple I hadn't seen before. They were both at least 75, and sat close, holding hands throughout the first half of the service. When we got to the Nicene Creed, I stood, and the husband stood, holding hands with his wife, who remained sitting. I closed my eyes, partially for concentration, and partially because I had only awoken minutes earlier. Pausing, I heard the wife struggling to remember the entire creed. I heard her faint whispers of her favorite lines, a tiny, cracking voice, chanting with the congregation. "We look for the resurrection of the dead...And the life of the world to come," she finished, grasping her husband's hand ever tighter. He looked down at her, a mixture of pity and affection filling his eyes. We sat together in shared silence for a few moments, and Father Nick addressed us, saying, "And the Peace of the Lord be always with you." I glanced over again, intrigued by the two. He sat, kissed her on the cheek and said "I love you." I turned to shake their hands, and the woman reached and whispered in her failing voice, "God's Peace be ever with you." At that point I was starting to get slightly emotional, and after shaking a few more hands, I sat. I don't know what it was, but something about the entire scene was so beautiful, and so filled with real, honest to god affection, I couldn't stop watching. At the end of the service, he hugged her, picked her up ever so gently and set her in a wheelchair. They left, and I left, and who knows if we'll ever meet again? All they should know is, that for those few minutes, they gave me a view of what love is really like.

      So I decided against the play, mostly because I have to be up early tomorrow for church. I finally got some recognition for my hours of folding mens' jeans. The skin is pealing off my fingertips, so its a good thing i don't work for a while longer. I didn't make Justice for YIG, but I've decided it would be a lot of work I dont have time for. I'm very afraid to talk on the instant messenger, for reasons that shall remain a secret. I think I want a bagel. Off I go...and then maybe I'll go to bed...then who knows ;)?!?! Oh how I despise that. I may have offended someone, and thats my biggest fear. What a world we live in. Piece of Wisdom: Ask Sandy "how the fuck [she is]".

      FRIDAY AT LAST. So I get to english, and there are some notes for what to do on the board: 1) Turn in your paper 2) Don't ask for a stapler 3) Take the quiz 4) I hate you all. God bless Prof. McCormick, the crazy drunk Irishman he is. So tonight is Tara's birthday, and I'm thinkin maybe a little bit of the ol pizza place? Who knows (insert winking face)?! I may have done not so well on the algebra quiz, and our psych sub was a stuck-up Oklahoman...the worst kind. So Maggums and Stenson are now an item...*snaps*. I hate calling anything plural "an item" so I will never use that phrase again. There's a cerial bowl in my backpack, and I keep forgetting why it's there and to take it out. PLay tomorrow night...any takers? I just finally got all the senior pictures in an album, and I may have missed getting some people's. Also, I may have run over broken glass in the parking lot. Not cool. Again, I will leave you with a tidbit of information for your own personal use: "4) I hate you all". Amen.

      THE ALGEBRAIC DREAM TEAM HAS ADDED A MEMBER! Snaps for Katie Carr, newest draftee. So tonight I finally learned something about algebra, which tells us that boline should be fired, sent back to Finland, or both. Days till movie night and the inaugural appearence of the shirt? Estimated 23. Estimated, because calendars that combine the 24 and 30 confuse me. Now I'm reading two books for two english classes, but I can't decide which to read before bed. That's right, two books, one bed. The question is, "1984" or "Fast Food Nation"? Will someone please tell me why Mungfei is my hero? And tell Erica to turn off the projector, please? UGH. The Wallflowers ROCK, especially   Josephine   but thats another story. I'm going to sleep now, and reading nothing. I'll leave you with the following piece of wisdom, for your own use: Liebow's mom has got it goin on. Farewell.

      So yeah, that post is from yesterday....don't worry? The Weekly Meeting of The Algebraic Dream Team will take place this evening...if all goes as planned. Do yourself a favor and go see "Finlandia²" this summer. It's bound to be a smash hit. And I hate biology alot, but I will go anyway. Then I have to pretend I missed a day for a funeral or something...yeah thats it. I figured out my future job. I'll be the Tariff of Nottingham, yuk yuk yuk. Yep, I'm going to be a tax on imports. Tomorrow: big quiz, big test, "shhhh"'s birthday party. Anyone want to go see the play either Saturday night or Sunday afternoon? Message me if you do...and then make me a sandwich. Mr. Schmitz didn't look much like Cogsworth today, despite his pocketwatch and vest. Alright more tonight...come, now is the time for biology. To be continued...

      Wednesday, November 12, 2003Today...What is to be said? Got up too late, forgot to finish the algebra...found the reciprocal of sree...left choir early in a frantic rush, having forgotten to print off the English paper...did Latin DURING english, did English during Latin, forgot to study for the Latin Quiz, tomorrow thank god, and still haven't pracitced the Southtown Carols...I like the ellipses.... For my money, the best pop is definitely Sprite. How much does a used iron cost? Oh, and does anyone know what time we're leaving for Florida? Because, thats like 52 hours out of a week GONE. Speaking of Gone, thats a really good song. I wake up in the night, all alone, and it's alright. The chemicals are wearing off since you've gone Precious. Skank and Sancho did the old lady today in Latin. HA! I wanted to leave and go do it at the physics room, but I held back. So I'm thinkin' a little swing dancing Friday night? You never know?! I've a riddle: What time is the Pillsbury doughboy's funeral? 3:50 for 20 minutes... HA again. I hate Simple Plan and Good Charlotte. And that....is that.

      Alright it is now time to update. Today was weird...it was neither completely good nor bad. Good things: Two Hour Delay (did that really warrant capitalization?), No homework check, Mung Fei walked in late, Sparknotes for The Iliad completely printed, Test moved forward two days, no check in Modern Euro. Bad things: forgot completely to finish the Iliad, battery died before 5th hour, Sassenberg freaked out because she's bipolar, and car finally died at rctc, as we spent two hours in the meadow trying to figure out what was wrong, car alternator died. Friday night: SOUND of MUSIC at Willow Creek. Go. DO IT. Oh yeah, and I forgot my algebra book at school. Crappy. THe concert went well, except Brian sneezed on the back of my head. That was gross. and 9 days till Florida. I should have spelled that number out, because it is less than ten. Abort. Abort Veniki Blog. *poof*

      tonight I was looking for my old copy of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". I ventured into the downstairs room, which, as we remodel the basement has become the furniture storage room. So I flip the lightswitch and remember we haven't yet changed the lightbulb because noone ever goes in there anyways. The closet still holds my and my brothers' stuff from when we all occupied it at random points. Opening the closet door, which thankfully has a working bulb, I looked through the tiny bookcase we all made when I was in 5th grade. All these books filling the shelves given to me over the years, knowing they hadn't been read in years, some of them were my grandparents' and now that my brothers are getting older, nobody will even remember these books exist for some time. And it's sad. Especially because there's no reason to forget "The Little Rabbit Who Wanted Red Wings", given to Kathryn Kay Carson, Dec. 31 1947. Why can't anyone remember how 'he went home to his Mummy, who knew him right away and was so glad to see him; and the little White Rabbit never, never again ." How can anyone bear to leave these in a cold, dark, basement closet? I can't anymore and I'm beginning the process of salvaging them. Then my memories won't be shut up and secluded, but exposed to light and given attention they deserve as the things that shaped my childhood. And now I go.

      How I feel after several disheartening revelation were made last night:  Woke up way too late, feeling hungover and old  And the sun was shining bright and I walked barefoot down the road  Started thinking 'bout my old man  It seems that all men want to get into a car and go anywhere   Here I stand sad and free  I can't cry I can't see  What I've done  Oh God what have I done?   Don't you know I'm numb, man  No I can't feel a thing at all  'Cause it's all smiles and business these days  And I'm indifferent to the loss   I think that there's a soul somewhere that's leading me around  I wonder if she knows which way is down   Here I stand, sad and free  I can't cry, and I can't see  What I've done  Oh God what have I done?   I poured my heart out  I poured my heart out  It evaporated...see?   Blind man on a canyon's edge of a panoramic scene  Maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random  Dangling on a string, or slumped over in a vacant room head on a stranger's knee  I'm sure back home they think I've lost my mind   Here I stand, sad and free  I can't cry and I can't see  What I've done  Oh God what have I done?

      I would now like to recite a few lines from one of my new favorite songs:  there you are with Aunt Louise, you're bouncin' on her knees  remember all those trees behind the garden,  they're gone, they all got cut down when she died.  thats a depressing but good one. My day today was weird. I was attacked by a self-righteous prick...hopefully got an A on the psych presentation...ooo and got extra credit in english for coloring...did southtown (dirty?)...and I guess I enjoyed most of it, but my mom and I got in another of the infamous fights. and I think my parents expect too much out of me. They think I can get good grades in 6 honors classes while working 35 hours a week balancing extracurriculars. I really want to go to New York over Spring Break. My parents are considering it, very cautiously, I might add. I just want to spend the time with my friends...I've spent the last 16 Spring Breaks with them and now, its time for me to make one decision on my own. ERGH. It's good to get emotions out in the open. I'm a factory. What is diversity counsil all about? I was told to be in it or else. So. I think I'm going to do some psych in a lil bit.

      Alright...I hate hypocrites...which is strange because I find myself becoming a bit of one sometimes. I just don't understand how one can gather so much from a faith or reasoning, project and moralize about it, and then completely disregard it for some machissmo induced fun. And there's nothing I can do about it. I'm going to go think...if anyone wants to talk about it, feel free.

      far too long has it been. Christmas was charming again. Sitting in the soft candle-lit sanctuary singing Silent Night until there was nothing more than whispers. It was cool. Alto love was expressed at the Paula's house. It was apparently a gala. Her cousin is an AZN Nazi. It's like a combination of the Tojo and Hitler. Scary...NOW DO MY HAIR! shudder. My birthday was fun. I'm now 17. Be excited or else. I want to write about the Florida trip tomorrow because there's so much and I'm very tired. So. thats that i guess. Except the music video. But that can wait.

      whirlwind/doozy of a week. I have a new favorite classical song...here are the lyrics:  O my luve's like the red red rose that's newly sprung in June; O my luve's like the melodie that's sweetly play'd in tune  As fair art Thou, my bonnie lass. So deep in luve am I, I will love Thee still my dear, till a' the seas, till a' the seas till a' the seas gang dry!  I will luve Thee still my dear, while the sands of life shall run; Till the seas gang dry my dear and rocks melt with the Sun.  As fair art Thou my bonnie lass,  so deep in luve am I. I will luve Thee still my dear, tho it were ten thousand, tho it were ten thousand, tho it were ten thousand mile!   its so cool...Sweetheart was great fun. It turned out amazing-ly...I'm not sure thats exactly a word. I think it is, but i'm not going to go back and change it. I wish my brother hadn't destroyed my Our Lady Peace CD. it was a good'un. The Trio had an insane night of Project Gotham Racing 2...a streak of 20 games...only the finest of European racers were invited. TRUST ME. and. I'm really tired so here ends the weekly update. I want a car that i can fold into a briefcase.

      this weekend was fun. Jeffers and I built a shrine to the Bronwyn. Then we heard her confirmation story...not really, but i'm not sure i remember it. wait, wait,...i have it. Lilo and Stitch is a funny movie. during the movie jeff and i went on a trek through the roenigk  house and took the 4-RUNNER out for a little spin-out action. it was craaaaazy. brendan and mike were at the morgenthalers', so i tried to teach myself some guitar method. i can read tabs....the only question is whether or not i can play them. I enjoyed swing dancing the other night. it was very fun, albeit short. so i find myself pleased with minor things. like switching my font color and size. and playing the only chord i know on the guitar, cupboard knobs, spinning out in a 4-runner, being with people i like and admire, watching an artistic movie that's actually good. i want to go hang gliding and parachuting, and parasailing. I want to sit with a girl in the park and listen to the orchestra and drink champagne. that would require a different age and location though. but still. i'm lovin' it ®. I think i better get down to some translating, and maybe work tonight. speak it.

      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd; But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou growest:       So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,       So long lives this and this gives life to thee.  It's a sonnet like this that actually makes me search my life. Do I know someone out there more lovely and temperate than the Day? Perhaps...perhaps not. I wonder once in a while. I see all of these people who cant do anything without their significant other, and I notice that I can't even imagine restricting myself to just hanging out with one person. And I don't mean to sound chauvinistic, but there are so many experiences to be grasped. I probably shouldn't be on the soapbox, since im sitting here on the computer....but yeah. I suppose that should be my goal...eh...society as a whole's goal. to find that one other whose eternal summer shall not fade. in a purely holistic sense. im rambling. good night.

      my manager came back from wherever shes been for the last 6 months. now she has different colored hair and is pregnant  in other news, 13 days till Sweetheart. It will be fun. the group is cool, and hopefully as little time will be spent at the actual dance as possible. if it wasnt on the 14th, we all could have gone to the swing formal dance downtown. now THAT would be classy. i would certainly be lovin' it. my parking pass is now expired, so if anyone wants to give me a ride all of second semester, feel free. im listening to a "street" version of Amazing Grace. i got some COOL new shoes for $9.97. That was definitely a highlight of the weekend. and once again i have spent 10 minutes writing about nothing. *POOF*

      i think people should carry the pain on the inside and fight it, not always, but instead of letting it out and showing the weakness, they should find someone they trust. i dont know where this came from. Also, Full House isn't that funny. which is sad. but anyway. i think i want summer, and i want to work at a resort up north. how cool would that be?   "I shoulnt be writeen this note,               but i coulnt force my self to stop talkeen and then start seeneen" UGH  GRADUATION PARTIES SOON whoop whoop

      so i was told that some people out there think that i'm gay...all i can say is 1) fuck you and 2) mind your own fucking business. my life isnt under the fucking microscope so you can make unfounded conclusions and then pretend they're facts. alos, would you mind telling  me  what you think instead of telling my friends? maybe then i wouldn't be so pissed at you. for future reference: im not gay, and my life is not your business.

      why do i have to fucking push myself so hard in certain classes? why can't i have been born with some idea of how to fucking compute factors? and why does it matter? its been asked a million times before, i know, but theres never been an answer. math, if you don't care = useless. dont fucking tell me ill need it later in liffe, because it DOESNT MATTER. i dont find it at all fulfilling/necessary. Honestly. Will there never be anyone around if i need to factor something? will i ever NEED to factor? will i remember how to in 3 months? the answer is no. no. i dont need to do this, and i dont have to go through the i-feel-stupid phase because some finnish immigrant says that if i can't do this, i'm not a worthwhile human being. f the world tonight.

      you know whats funny? when your first hour class *reading and study skills* is filled with people who are only semi-literate. did i say funny? i meant depressing/suicide-provoking. HAH AHAHHA AAHA AHAHAA cuttttttt. its also fun to make 60,000 photocopies of pirates. Arrrrrrrrrrrrrr. or fail the math test. or get a C on the nle. THAT is unacceptable. i got an a last year. what is going on? but you know what actually is fun? getting up early to just sit and listen and walk outside in the semi-warmth. and imagining someone saying "you saved my life". and asking the nymphs to play barley-break. and listening to someone laugh for a long time about something completely incoherent. and having a sub in math. and watching people make fools of themselves in speech while swimming in goop. and having 99% in english. these are the good things and there are more of them than the bad things and that in itself is a good thing.

      I can't say that i'm usually too fond of opera. i don't mind it, but itisn't my music of choice. but i was on barnesandnoble.com and heard amici forever, this new opera quintet. the song they sang, senza catene, was really cool. i strongly recommend it. i ordered the metamorphoses by ovid. WHAT? MEE? GIUUUUUUUUULIA??? ha. the old othello showdown almost ended in bloodshed. other than that it was depressingly boring. im going to go read something, maybe the decamerone. arr.

      time for the near-weekly update. The basement is almost finished...we're only lacking some furniture and a fire place. I'm almost finished with The Catcher in the Rye... after that im seriously lacking a good, classic book to read (ha). but seriously, i may just have to ask Milburn for one if nobody else can help me. Speaking of Milburn, today she told her story about when she was a Bible smuggler in East Germany...there are just those things that you would never guess about your teachers, like when certain foreign language instructors make out during class. sick. or connie's pink leather thong and exotic dance routines. shudder. that last one crosses the line. excuse me while i go vomit. John Cusack is definitely not an exceptional actor, despite his career proving otherwise. I'm really excited for spring and summer. seriously. enough of this school crap. I don't exactly know what I want to do, but mowing the lawn, drinking lemonade on the deck, and playing frisbee in the park are definitely on the list. WOO HOO. I need to take the SATs/ACTs. Because I need to get into the U of M law school. and I need to make big money, and have a big house, and turn full circle back into the rampant materialism i both love and hate. And That. is THAT. so there you go...take it or leave it.

      parents are interesting.  they won't go to your final concert, but they will freak out about a pair of lost sandles which weren't a gift from them and even though i give assurances of what i will do or how i will deal it never actually stops the barrage of "how could you let this happen?" but ill deal with it quietly with no actual emotion just staid indifference and honestly, there will come a day when i wont be here and i wont be vindictive about it and i wont smile when they are in their hour of need ill just be kind of sad not just for them but for me because i know in my heart of hearts that that is the way it has to be and they'll hear the concert in their heads

      oh man im really excited for this year to be over latin is going to  be my death actually the verb synopsis is all that i fear otherwise, everything should be good but check out my finals: DAY 1 Reading and Study Skills: My literacy should net me an easy A Teacher Aide: 20 minutes of grade entering=P Choir:...that'll be a toughy. just kidding. but i did make it Algebra II: this is the death stroke (left stroke?) I live in fear Latin: the great Virgil essay should be enhanced by the art of BS Speech: i'm thinkin...a lil BREADS? English: i haven't actually read any of the stories this semester. and thats okay.  anyway, this may be the first year where i do really well. and i desperately need a 3.8 GPA. next year will help, im sure. but only because im taking certified easy classes. all will be well. now to take an SAT practice. away.

      so i cant find my Dannon Frusion®...probably the least of my toubles. I left my algebra book at school, even though i know i wouldnt study if i had it. i finished two of five paragraphs for monson, though. WOOT. so far i'm at seven pages. and ill probably run out ink printing it off. why is ink so expensive? OWKNOW. the final  official  SNM was last night...good times. JAR JAR was hitting on tom, a torch and a lawn tractor screamed down a hill, a chair was stolen, and due to some campfire troubles, we are all now sterile. loooong story. this time of year is always a lil bittersweet. i really dont want to go to school anymore, but i know after two months, ill start to hate life. and then everyone will leave...but you know what? theres always christmas and summer breaks. and the INTRA-NET. and stuff. anyway...i think ill start my third paragraph leave a comment, sloppy.

      all i really want to say is you're the reason  i want to stay. but destiny is calling, and i'm holding but my time is up; i'm outta here... all i know is i gotta be  where my heart says i oughta be.  it often makes me sick in fact i never understand these things i feel. i love you good bye i love you good bye  this should be a song choir sings to the seniors. it's both upbeat and deep, not like sugar-coated-pop-life-is-sweet-dude songs, and not like i-hate-life-connie-boline-gothika style either. a happy medium is what i search for in music, and in this i have found it. in case you are wondering the title of this epic masterpiece, it is  Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds. Ahhhh. I want to fight. Hey you know what's fun? MOWING THE LAWN. it creates such order out of chaos. i think theres a latin phrase i will be tested on with that meaning. f. speaking (speaking?) of latin, I CLAVDIVS has been quite interesting...that Caligula. What does he do when he's  not  eating babies or becoming a transvestite dancer? WHO KNOWS?! Claudius is my alter ego...or maybe fred jones. there is a man here to take me downstairs, and he is sorry. i like that song 2. or II. or too. or two. or to. or thoo. that last one wasnt a word, but if it were, it would  probably  be pronounced like that. right. annnnnd cut.

      have you ever had one of those days? mine has been really weird. I got up and wrote a speech and did a fallacies project, and was feeling pretty drained before i had to go to work. it was crazy. anyway, i got home and was feeling cynical and disgusted and stressed due to the latin quiz tomorrow (curse the synopsis). and then i thought about things. there is barely a month left of school, im doing well in every class, i have friends that care about me, and my family is infinitely less annoying tonight. so why feel sorry for myself? here's an inspirational quote for the next time you or I feel the self pity:                          "Whoever you are, I doubt Heaven is unfriendly                                  to you, as you still breathe life-giving air"                                                                   -- Virgil's Aeneid

      well, it's official now  i'm moving in two weeks, to a house i've never even seen before i'll still go to mayo, but ill be about 10 miles out of town.  and i don't like it. i could go into the specifics of why this would be a bad idea, but i'd prefer not to, since i apparently had no say in the decision. this home isnt the only one ive known, gosh when i was little, we moved constantly, but when we finally could afford a house of our own, we were all really proud. we fixed alot of it up, and recently finished remodeling half of the basement. over a ten year period, weve changed it to perfectly suit all of us. and then that desire kicks in, the instinct to move, an instinct too anachronistic for our society in which comfort conquers all. and why are we moving? because our property value is as high as it will get? because we're bored? or just because? who knows? aside from the personal stress it will cause me, i know that this is not a good decision. and i dont like it. its so weird to be back here....

      its funny when you remember old inside jokes. i just spent 5 minutes trying to recall what "ALCARAZ [sic]" meant. and im kindof excited that i remember that it was on the back of a car in white letters from last summer. ha, no t or anything. i worked all day and around 3 i had this really crazy desire to read the newspaper and sleep. i fear this summer is aging me tremendously. oh well. so much for never attending the teen dance thing. although it was pretty far from any sort of dance, and there was no real music. but thats okay. i saw lots of people i knew. alex allen is a band with the will from barnes and noble. SNM wednesday july 28. YES. im schizophrenic ive decided. al;kdjf;lkasdf. okay thats enough for now. L.

      i need a break from this crazy summer. ive worked like 35 hours in the past week...im all about the 9-5 shifts. im looking forward to taking the day off of everything sometime soon. any conservatives out there should message me and ill tell you whats up for rochesterfest 2004. ive decided to never attend anything called a "teen dance" or "teen night"...they just seem kindof pathetic. not a reflection of the people who put them on, but rather the type of people who go to them. like the streetdance tonight. who wastes their time going to listen to crappy music and 'dance' with complete strangers? it baffles me. in other news, its been eight days sans caffeine, and im now tired at 3 in the afternoon- i think my biological clock wants me dead. i need to do something extraordinary this summer, so if you have any plans, dont hesitate to call my house or track me down in the night-both are acceptable. until we meet again, farewell.

      the years go on and we're still fighting it we're still fighting it  so true. graduation was an interesting time, i just dont think it would have been a party without the monsoon. that word reminds me of monson, which reminds me of grades. i got them in the mail. and i did pretty well this term. i think anyways. and my b on the algebra test brought me to a c in the class. shingggggggggg. summer is going well so far. my brothers are uber-annoying, but thats okay because ive been working something like 7 hours a day. im very excited for payday and the ensuing dropping of cash. ive been off caffeine for five days now...thats something to be proud of, considering i used to not be able to go for a whole day without it. the nights have been filled with the smooth stylings of pool and bonfires, and an especially poignant time with some friends watching requiem for a dream. ahhh. what a great (but depressing) movie. i miss some of my friends from school, but there will be plenty of time for fire-bombing this summer. so, if you havent seen/heard from thus far, live in fear. and now im off.

      well, this summer seems to have begun right where last summer left off....with the police. i didnt get in trouble for anything (and rightfully so), but apparently somebody i was driving did. ohhhhh chambez...when will you learn? anyway, in spite of almost losing my license last night, it turned out to be a pretty good time. ceremonial burning, family guy, 1000 piece president puzzle at katie carr's. oh man. this summer is starting in a way that will make it hard to forget....no matter how hard we try...leave some comments

      ahh summer. my best friend and my worst foe. i love the warmth and freedom, but i hate that inevitable point 1.5 months in when things get weird. you know. when you start getting bored with life and you don't want to be doing the same old thing anymore. fast-forward to mid-february, when you would kill for just one night cruising broadway over and over again. i guess it just proves that there can be too much of a good thing. i should note that its not my friends that make the summer get old; with few exceptions my friends are the ones who keep me sane. but i can't shake the feeling that this summer will be the same. good, but so much the same. leave your opinions. happy summer all.

      i hate to say it, but for the first time in three years of high school, i can honestly say i hate one of my teachers. if you know who it is, thats fine. but i cant respect someone who says im wasting his or her time while im asking them a question. i find it funny that he or she went into teaching if he or she thinks everyone knows everything. its insane. and once again, the old apathy sets in. i stopped caring about this class months ago, when he or she stated becoming hostile. and it's just not worth it anymore. its sad. because honestly, this is high school. nobody gives a shit about classes in the last three days. sigh. i better try and get a little more of this done. leave some comments if you e/sy-mpathize. night, all.

      well, they asked me to resign from youth commission. i cant say that i wasnt expecting it, having not gone to about 8/10 meetings this year. i didn't even want to go most of the time, and when i did, i forced myself to be interested in things that really weren't so great. and all the same, it kind of hurts. to be told that you're no longer needed, covered in flowery words telling me how i could be benefited by this new-found freedom. and i know i can't do anything about it, now that it's final. but something i loved so much last year changed. and it's my fault. but i don't really care...i think that's what i feel the most guilty about.

      what is right with the world? seeing one of your best friends randomly at a concert and finding yourself so thankful for them watching the sunset and meeting people you haven't seen in months art the view from a bridge over a forest screaming 'waste 'a time' at the top of your lungs someone telling you that they really want to spend time with you enjoying time with extended family creating a blazing bonfire faith a euphoric emptiness cold air still air and stars trusted assurance knowing the difference between much and many longing 'abide with me' leave a comment with things that make you appreciate life more

      while cleaning out my closet (eminem...) i found this paper we did for creative writing in 4th grade. and i've come to the conclusion that i was insane. ill put the text of it in, complete with errors, because i'm supremely bored. here goes:  Teacher for a Day Hello, my name is Mr. Sikkema.Or at least it was a few days afo when I was the teacher for a day. THat morning i made four main rules.1.No eating or drinking in class. 2.No disrespecting your peers. 3.Act Safely. 4.No Homework !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. If you were to break one of these rules then you would get a warning. If you did it again then you would have to lick the bottoms of everyone's feet. Creating assignments was pretty fun. THe hardest assignment I gave was in math. It was doing the whole book;but if you didn't finish it by the end of the day, you could just stop.The longest assignment I gave was in English. They had to memorize 17 words and their definitions in one letter of the alphabet.  But it was all worth it: In gym we went bunjee jumping. Two really great things happened that day:A kid who just got back from Hawaii brought me a coconut and I escaped death.See, a psychopathic nun on the loose got into the school and shot at me. But I dodged the bullet with the greatest of ease and it punctured another kid's lung. The only hard part about being the teacher is yard duty.One kid broke his leg, another threw up, and another kid had a concussion when he fell off the seings. And all this happened at the same time!I was the only teacher out there so I just sat by the baseball fields. Things didn't get any better in class though: One kid forgot his name and another lost his desk.The worst problem was my student for the day. She jumped on my desk and started tap-dancing! There was only one thing I could do with her: Lick the bottoms of everyone's feet. I mad e some changes in class to make life easier: I made the lunches and gave them another half hour of recess. I tried not to make anything to hard for the students because i knew how it felt to get tons of homework.At the end of the day, I felt exhausted. I learned that being a teacher is the greatest job ever!  and that was it. 1ts 5.42 on the flesch kincaid scale....and that's cool for 4th grade. now ima haffa continue to pack my room.

      this move angers me for a variety of reasons. i dont want to get into them, as i said before, but it should suffice to say this: today my parents flat-out told me that my opinion didn't matter. they said i could move out when i turn 18. as unlikely as that is, its nice to have it put out there that im not needed. and that is how my day has gone so far. fuck it.
