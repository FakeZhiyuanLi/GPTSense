      Saw an interesting book review today in the Sueddeusche Zeitung:  urlLink > Noch immer geleugnet , by Egon Flaig   scary stuff, slavery appears alive and well. I have heard about this before, parts of the african population (but not only them) are still targets,  and some of the cultures who have been importing slaves for more than 1000 years, are apparently still doing it. I wonder where one gets better information about this kind of thing...  the United Nations are aware of this sort of stuff, for example in a  urlLink report of the Office of the High Comissioner on Human Rights . But these organizations have to arrive at some bureaucratic consenus for public consumption, so as not to  insult member states too much. Some aspects of the problem could well be worse. Some examples have been written about in  urlLink respected journals , and I'm sure there is a lot more. It doesn't seem to get much press in the dailies.

      Still working on my vacation plans, its hard to get flights. And the airlines complain about lack of business, this doesnt seem very consistent.  Ausserdem noch: bei der Euro dieser ganze Streit ueber Deutschland - Holland. Wochenlang, mindestens. Vor dem Spiel: ist Weltkrieg Revanche, oder sogar Rache. Man hat so richtig Angst.  Und dann ? 1-1.  Entscheidung wird vertagt ? Oder war es doch nur ein Fussballspiel.  Na ja.

      Before I forget it, here are notes about train travel in Europe. This is in two parts.        These things that I am sure are well known in the train travelling community, but are maybe not completely obvious to people more used to air travel and cars and such.   In some countries, the train stops are announced in the train, and outside the train. In other countries this does not happen. Of course, if you don't understand the language it doesn't matter. Say, for example, you know English, French, and German. You will not understand much in Hungary or Bavaria. In Bavaria, this is because they don't speak German. In Hungary, its because they dont announce anything.   So, you read signs, and maybe get some advance information. The internet is fine for the advance info (for example at  urlLink www.bahn.de,  in german and english. And maybe in something else, I forget, so go and look.) But don't trust them completely, their knowledge of schedules is imperfect, especially outside of their company territory.   Now, suppose you have found the right train. It goes to where you want to go, and probably much further too. When do you get off the train?   One thing to do is write or print the schedule of stops, and then count and possibly identify the stops. This gives you an idea of where you are, relatively speaking, and how late the train is. Most train stations have signs telling you where you are, but you may not see those if you look at the wrong time. I don't know what i would do with the signs in Greece or Russia, where they have their own special alphabets (and I'm sure those alphabets are much better too). Or in Arabia, East Asia and the like, but then I said  Europe  at the start.   If you want to sleep on the train (and much of the scenery you see will suggest this is a good idea), you will need help with the counting of those stops. Similarly, if you sleep, and then re-orient yourself afterwards, be aware that not all of Europe is in the same time zone. This can be a factor if you traval east, you could wake up an hour too late, and overshoot your destination, which can be painful.   Considering staying the better part of a night in a train station, because of scheduling difficulties? Be aware that some of them close at night (e.g. Wien Westbahnhof), which gives you an opportunity to hang out with the local homeless population. If you can get a  Eurail  pass of some kind, you may have extra time and unlimited mileage available on trains, instead of long hours in the train stations. This can be more pleasant and comfortable. Those are often (don't quote me on this) available only as first class tickets, which can be cool on the German ICE trains - nice and comfortable for the night, and they treat you as if you have money. Cool.      Or, you can fly.

        Vacation is over, I'm home and safe. Not that it was particularly risky on my trip. I had a great time, as often happens my vacation was not long enough. I met some nice people, one of them was particularly wonderful - you know who you are.  Now the weather is unusually cool, it must be because of the global warming.

      IÂ´m on my vacation now, things are working ok, and I get to where i want, more or less on time. But I am having a little trouble with these german kezboards. The z is where the y normally is. So I have to look at the keyboard while I type. And some of the function keys have really funny names. Who translated this stuff ?
