      So...its been a few days, the beginning of the end of not writing in here everyday--grrrr@myself for not being stronger.I can do this I know I can...hehe  So--I saw a few good movies this past weekend...I feel like a nerd instead of the geek that I know I am by seeing Spiderman 3 times now. See thats what happens when you try to not necessarily date but you dont have a name for it yet thing and men want to see a movie that is so near and dear to their heart. hahaha! First I saw it with my best friend and some guy he wanted both of us to meet not really a date but you know how friends are, second saw it with some guy that I met, really not a date either... randomly and asked if I wanted to go to dinner and a movie and he seemed nice--note to self-objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer and seem nicer than they are...and then the third time was worth it, it was with this guy that I know from work and this wasnt a date either...he knows my situation and take on dating. I am not dating--not interested...sure what girl wants her parents breathing down her neck about bringing someone home someday and are you going to be able to still have children by the time you get around to it...gag me with a freaking spoon...I want to tell my parents about 800 things that I dont want them to know about how the last jerk off really was a big jerk instead of charbroiling every nice thought that they ever had of him. See I am not that terrible grill him cause he was an a$$ kind of girl--it ended, thank God...  My mother asked me--are you a lesbian is that why you dont want us to meet anyone--no its because you are a starke raving lunatic when it comes to meeting a guy I am dating and you ask him about his sperm count in the first 5 mins of conversation and I have not even asked him that yet....sheesh Ahhhh I feel much better now.   Onto better and brighter things...I am smiling! :) hehehe I promise to be back later and bring you up to speed on things. Later

      Well--good morning...  I have decided to give myself a challenge, write in this thing. Express myself more. I found my self telling someone today that the only reason he fells inferior is because he let someone make him feel inferior. I sometimes wonder why when I need this advice instead of asking friends or talking with my friends, I just don't ask myself. Holy Shi* I just used an apostrophe!? When in the heck did I start doing that?! As you might later after about 100 of these notice this doesnt happen. See...told ya!  Any way back to my rant...how many times I get bad advice. I try not to give bad advice. I try to stay away from my friends that are ending relationships and who are fighting with the love of their lives. I just dont want to cloud someones else dream and life. I do good on my own.   Who am I to tell someone what I think? Am I being a friend just letting them sit on the sidelines? I sometimes wonder what in life I am supposed to do...my job that I am blessed with everyday is so right...yet here I am in a blog saying what I really mean. How about this....let me share my little list of ten things I want to do some in the near future...but not so distant either. 1o. Give up a bad habit this year.  NiNe. Listen to a new musician and be open minded.  Ocho. Go to a movie without reading the reviews and be open minded about seeing a bad one--so they say!  7. Find a good charity and take my weekly shoe money for the year and donate it to a good cause.  SiX. I want to fall in love everyday of the week...same person--just everyday. Cinco. Read a self discovery book and read it all. Foooour. Take a random road trip with friends.  3. Email my friends and family more often.  TWO. Write a book, "random thoughts" by Candice-- sounds good huh!?  The BIG numero Uno--Allow myself to be myself to find happiness and be happy with what I find or sont find along that path.  I look back at things and I think as all of my friends are getting married and some of them are going thru a divorce and some are still trying to find that person that completes them...I watch their mistakes and I see their successes...there are things that with time change. I am happy that life is what we make of it that way in the end I can look back and say that I didnt tiptoe around my life so I could arrive safely at my final resting place...I lived my life the way I wanted to, and the way that I saw fitting. I know my list isnt important to anyone really but me, because its my list...and I hope that you have a list...that when you need something to look forward to, you can look at your list. Well I think as of right now--I am going to say peace and I will share more random thoughts soon...
