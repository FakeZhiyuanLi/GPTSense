      I've been reading other's blogs for years, and have finally decided to start my own. My motivation stems from my upcoming year-long deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. I figure with a year to pass with not much more than internet access for communication, this would be an easy way of communicating with everyone (without filling up a lot of inboxes). So here I go, charging into battle like Audie Friggin' Murphy: The Legend Continues...

      Well, I've finally made across the world to Kuwait. I will be staying here in Camp Wolverine for a few days before I rejoin my unit in Baghdad. Talk about a long trip. We left around 11:00 PM Thursday, May 13th, and after an hour and a half layover in Maine and another in Frankfurt, Landed in Kuwait around 2:30 AM Saturday, May 15. I'm still fighting the jet lag. Everyone else who came with me already gave up. They're all sleeping. Well, I log in again when I get to Baghdad. Es salaam alaikum.  P.S. Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...

      Today, we had some time off for R&R. We drove to BIAP (Baghdad International Airport) in order to go to the big PX they have there. The traffic was horrible. EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) had a major freeway blocked off to detonate a suspected IED. We had to take an alternate route. The problem was that everyone else decided to take the same route. We were in armored vehicles with enough weapons and ammo to take over a small country and it still took us two and a half hours to get halfway across Baghdad. I looked around there for a while, but the only thing on my list that they had was an ice chest, blank CD's, bedsheets, and a blanket. I did have a couble of Double Whoppers with cheese from Burger King, though. After we left the PX, we went to a couple of Hadji stores they has in the area. I picked up a couple more crystals to send home along with a sword. I plan on spending a couple of hours tonight sharpening it for battle.  Once again, I waited in line for an hour to get on the internet, but I gave up. One of these days I will be able to post something, but untiol then, I will sit here in the barracks and write e-mails and blog entries. When I do get online, I will have a lot to say.

      Today, when we got back from our morning mission, we cleaned aour weapons as usual. I was cleaning my M240B 7.72mm medium machine gun, M4 5.56 carbine, and M9 9mm pistol while my driver, Lucky, was cleaning his M4 and M9.  My support gunner, Espy, was cleaning his M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) 5.56mm light machine gun, M16 5.56mm rifle, and M500 12-gauge Combat Shotgun. Espy fits his position perfectly. We are the crew for the Luitenant, our Platoon Leader. When we are out of "the wire" (outside of the camp, on a mission), and we stop, I stay up in the turret and the machine gun and the driver either stays in the driver's seat or just outside his door, depending on the situation. That leaves the Luitenant and Epsy to dismount. Espy make one hell of a body gaurd. He is 6' 3" tall, weighs every bit of 235 pounds, and is built like a rock. Depending on the situation, he will leave the truck with different weapons. He usually keeps his M249 SAW slung across his back, his shotgun in one hand, and his 6 "D" Cell MagLite in the other. The SAW is a formidable weapon. It is about 3 1/2 feet long, weighs about 28 lbs with a 200 round drum of ammunition, has fold out bipod legs, and can fire 600 rounds a minute. His has a 10X scope and forward pistol grip so he can easily shoot it standing up. Most people have to set it down to shoot it. His shotgun is a standard 12-gauge 6-round pump action shotgun, with an ammo holder with 6 extra rounds mounted to the side, and a pistol grip instead of a buttstock. And yes, he can charge it and fire it with one hand. Needless to say, the Iraqis give him a wide berth. As we are standing at the hood of the humvee cleaning weapons, Lucky tells me that this morning he finally recieved the job order to get our A/C fixed on the truck. I had everyone drop everything and load into the truck. We went to our Forward Support Battallion's Motor Pool to get the A/C fixed. While we finished cleaning the weapons, a soldier found the leak. It was a little O-ring on the Schrader valve on the high side line. A tiny little O-ring. Anyway, we were a quick fix, a vacuum test and a recharge away from ice cold air.

      Today, we were patrolling sector 30. It's not our company's sector, but periodically we patrol other people's sectors to get familiar with them in case we have to go in there for backup. We were going through the slums there (and I mean SLUMS) and we found an anti-aircraft gun mounted in a twin-linked alternating mount on the burn-up turret of an ex-armored vehicle. We fought that thing for teo hours trying to get that gun out of the mount so that it could be confiscated. When I say we, I mean our platoon. I was providing security from the turret of my up-armored humvee. My luitenant, squad leader, and B section's squad leader were on the ground fighting this thing with the help of about 10 Iraqis. The children in the area were the most persistent I've come across to this date. We had no interpreter, so we had difficulty getting them out of the area. They had to go because we were trying to pull this thing apart with two humvees and they could get hurt or killed. We finally found the solution when some charged thier shotgun. I've never seen kids run so fast.

      I've gotten requests for a list of things to send. To make matters easier, I'll pile them all up here and let anyone who cares work it out with anyone else who cares on who sends what. Some of the things on this list are things I currently need, some are things that would be nice to have, and some are just things that are good to have lying around (deodart, toothpaste) because the PX is always out of about 1/3 of what they carry. Also, brand names listed are not nesseties, they are just my preferred brands. Without further ado, let's dive in.  Send:  -My checkbook out of my center console (I need this ASAP) -Dried Mangos. -Clothes Hangers (about 10) -Mangoes good. -Disposable prepasted toothbrushes -More mangos. -Anything you feeling like giving to the children of Iraq (candy, toys) -Philipine Brand dried mangos. -Canned Air and CD/DVD lens cleaner for my laptop -Did I mention I'm addicted to Mangos? -Several cans each "Powder Blast" dry solvent cleaner and "One Shot" dry solvent clean & lube or equivalents -- Availible at most Gunsmiths -Snacks. Some of my favoites are Triscuits, smoked oysters, and Loisiana Brand hot sauce; Doritos; dried mangos; etc...  -Axe Dry Phoenix Anti-Perspirant/Deodarant, toothpaste, cottenelle -Dried fruit such as mangos -Febreeze fabric refresher -Intercooler kit for a 6.2L Detroit Turbo Diesel -more about this later  Don't send:  Ammo, explosives, etc... Alcohol -Anything else under postal restrictions Movies Anything larger than a breadbox until I say otherwise. We have no room for ANYTHING until we move into our new barracks. --pictures by email. Bandwith here is about 19.6 Kbps. --weapons parts, attachments or accessories. Our adopt-a-unit sponsor is Guns Galore of Killeen. They have sent us a lot of things, plus we are recieving a lot of things through the Army supply system. We've got red dot sights; holographic sights; scopes; slings; pistol grips for our shotguns; forward pistol grips for rifles, carbines, and machine guns; SureFire TID's (tacticle illumination devices - anything that costs $100 can't be called a flashlight. www.surefire.com) for rifles and carbines; picatinny rail systems for M4's; ammo pouches; cleaning kits; etc...   As for the intercooler, that requires some explination. Our main threat right now here is IED's (ghetto bombs). It's mainly the support units that get affected by this, because they have to go slow in their convoys because of the big trucks. One of our missions during a patrol is to detect IED's. Being that are very difficult to see, you generally detect them (except for rare occasions) when they explode. One of our TTP's for handling this risk is simple. It's difficult to time an explosive device to detonate on a humvee doing 75Mph. Basically, we drive around in the middle of the night or early morning, when they set these things out, and make them waste the charge on us. It is suprisingly effective. There has not been one injury of a soldier during an IED sweep, even though that is when the majority of them are detonated. Anyway, back to the point of the story. It was inevitable that we try to see who is faster. Hence the humvee drag races in downtown Baghdad in the middle of the night. Hence the need of the intercooler. If you find one at a junkyard, let me know. Once again, I reiterate- A lot of what I tell you is of questionable classification. While I try not to divulge secret information, it is still in our best interest that you do not discuss anything I tell you with anyone else. Especially military. I would rather not have a court-martial. Loose lips sink ships and all that jazz.

      Our main duty right now is to patrol our company's sector. Each platoon will drive around for about 2 hours per trip about 2 times a day, sometimes longer, sometimes not so often. Our sector is one of the freindliest. Most adults and all children smile and wave at us. The kids are always happy to see us. They run up to the truck yelling, "Mista! Mista! Give choc-o-lotta!", or "...money!", or "...cigarettes!". No one gives them money, and they don't need cigarettes, but some of the gunners (I do it sometimes) tosses candy to the kids. Some of the kids are too cute. Especially when they say things like, "Mista! I love you!"   Today, I re-enlisted for another 5 years in the Army. I'm getting a $9,537 tax-free lump sum bonus. I did it at the Martyr's Monument in Baghdad. That place is absolutely beautiful. After my re-enlistmnet (I will have the pictures posted on Yahoo! soon), we went on a raid because someone had told the Commander that this one Iraqi had two howitzer rounds wired up as IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices, or as I call them, Ghetto bombs) in his house. We only found one mortar round, among other things, but we had to wait several hours for EOD (Explosive Ordinace Disposal) to arrive to destroy it. I was pulling security down on the street in the hatch of the Humvee. While I was there, this little girl about 9 years old, on a balcony of the building I was next to, kept waving at me and blowing kisses. She also threw a few pieces of candy to me, brought down the whole bag later, and then brought me a pack of cigarettes.

      It's really not all that bad here. We are stationed on Camp Cuervo, which is an abandoned Republican Guard Training Facility. It looks like it would have been nice 30 years ago. It's rundown horribly, but American and Iraqi contractors are hard at work renovating the place. On our camp we have a good chow hall, a gym, a PX (Post Exchange), and 2 little shopping centers where you can buy various things from local merchants. There are also several of the merchants that take requests and will go downtown and pick things up for you. We can theoretically get everything we need, it's just in short supply.  The only bad thing about life here is the barracks. Some are good some are bad. We have the worst. It a two-story metal building two long rooms per floor. Each room is about 15 feet wide and about a hundred feet long. Our company (about 65 people) live in one of these rooms. It's only temporary while they renovate the barracks we are moving into. They are actually done with the renovations, but there is no power in the builing until they finish fabricating the cable to attach hook it up to the generator. We hope to be in there within 2 weeks. I'm not counting on it, though.

      I'm going to try to post something every day now. Bear with me, because internet connection is sometimes hard to come by. I really don't have anything to say today, except that I miss Venus. A lot. I have grown quite accustomed to being separated from my family, but I can't seem to get over being separated from her. I love you, Venus. I love you more than you could possibly ever know.

                     We got back to base camp this morning around 0800.  I had only slept about&nbsp;two and a half hours, but I had a lot of errands I  had to run.&nbsp;I took a shower, shaved, brushed my teeth, gathered my laundry,  dropped said laundry off with the Wash Nazis, turned in a uniform to get  pressed, got a haircut, went to the hospital to get a ham and cheese sandwich  (the sandwich shop in the hospital is the only place to get fresh bread), picked  up a copy of PhotoShop from the movie store there (which later turned out to be  infected with a virus), went to finance to get some cash, sent some stuff back  home at the post office, picked up some phone cards so that I can call Venus,  and then tried to go online at the internet cafe. The internet cafe was closed  for some odd reason, so I went to a friends room to try to send out some info to  the outside world. I am lucky to have a friend like that who will let me use his  internet connection for a couple hours. I owe him many thanks. Thanks, Freaky.  Once I get done posting this stuff online, I will go pick up my uniform and get  some sleep. I can't wait to get some DNT (Dragoon Nappy  Time).

                     My god, was it boring. They day before yesterday,  we had to roll out of here in the evening time because Brigade HQ wanted us to  try to catch (kill) the Mad Mortarman who was launching random mortars into  their FOB (Forward Operating Base). The mortars aren't doing any damage, they  are just annoying. So they have us set in a concealed area near where they think  the guy is launching them from, in order to hear them and then give chase (and  gunfire). We ended up setting out there for about 4 hours. I cannot begin to  express upon you the level of boredom I sunk to. However, it was nothing  compared to last night. We went out again, but used a slightly different method.  I still ended up sitting at my machine gun for another 3 or 4 hours. I thought  it was getting bad, but when higher told us to head back to base, they also told  us to prepare to go back out there in the wee hours of the morning. That only  gave us 3 hours to sleep, but I made the best of it.      When we went back out there, we were all tired. It  gets interesting trying to stay awake sometimes. Some people just can't hack it.  I'm not mentioning any names, but you wouldn't recognize my Luitenant's name  anyway.&nbsp;I was doing good until about 0700. I had been sitting on top of the  humvee, with one leg hanging into the hatch. I was glad that leg was there,  because when I nodded off, I almost fell off the Humvee. It was at that time  that my support gunner asked if I wanted him to relieve me so that I could walk  around a little bit. I could not have said yes more enthusiastically. Anyway, we  watched our watch and nothing happened. Mission  Accomplished.

                     We had a different kind of mission today. We had to  escort the S-4 ( S taff officer # 4  - Logistics)&nbsp;to BIAP  ( B aghdad  I nternational  A ir p ort). They had a load of  new equipment to pick up, and they cannot leave by themselves because driving  through Baghdad in the middle of the day without at least 4 or 5 machine guns  mounted on the tops of vehicles is just a little past insane. It was interesting  because originally I was scheduled to report to the S-4 at 0630 in order to load  up on&nbsp;the truck so that I could go to BIAP with them so that I could draw  my RFI issue. RFI stands for "Rapid Fielding Initiative". It is a process that  is used when the Army decides to purchase some new equipment for the troops and  wants to field it quickly. We are getting issued new ammo pouchs that attach  flat to our body armor (much better than the bulky, floppy things I have now),  new &amp; improved green boot socks, silk underwear (very comfortable in this  heat, I hear), 4 new pair of boots - 2 summer, 2 winter (also getting rave  reviews), "assault packs"- camouflage&nbsp;backpacks with MOLLE attachment  points to put ammo pouches and what not on it with a built-in Camelback bladder  (very handy), and loads of other nifty stuff. I say WE are getting, but  actually, everyone else already has thiers, I'm just late getting into  country.     As it turned out though, are platoon  got&nbsp;assigned to escort this convoy to BIAP. We also had to supply the  truck. We coordinated to use our company supply truck, but First Sergeant would  only send the driver for it. So I got tapped to command the truck since I was  the highest ranking person without my own truck. At first I was aprehensive  because that truck will only do 50 mpH going downhill, which is also a little  risky. But since the truck was recently uparmored with 2.5 tons of hardened  steel plate and multi-layer ballistic glass, I felt relatively at  ease.     When we got to BIAP, we first went to the big PX  there to eat some Burger King. Then my luitenant took me over to the RFI  building, which by the way was right next to one of the largest palaces I've  seen so far. It was currently being used as the III Corps HQ. The line going  into the building was staggering. I asked someone who works there how long it  would take to get through the line. He said that we had picked a very bad day to  come.&nbsp;According to him, it would take 3 hours just to get into the  building. Since we had to leave at 1300, they decided&nbsp;to take me back here  some other day. I was glad they said that.&nbsp;I did not feel like standing in  the sun for 3 hours. It's alright anyway, since none of the stuff they are  issuing is mission dependant. It's basically upgraded versions of what&nbsp;I  have already. I can wait a few days.     We ended up loading the truck up and leaving at the  predesignated time, but not before spending a little time at the MWR (Morale,  Welfare, and Recreation) tent they had at BIAP. Plus I got to get another burger  from Burger King. That beats lunch at the chow hall any day. Mission  Accomplished.

                     I did not get out of the internet cafe until about  0025 last night (or this morning, actually), which was was good, considering  that the chow hall closes at 0030. I did not notice the time until 0020, because  I was so enthralled in the process of making my laptop act nice. Now this is a  story.     About 4 days ago, I finally got fed up with having  my hard drive in two partitions. Partitions are not necessarily a bad thing, but  my laptop came factory with a 10 GB hard drive with a&nbsp;2.35  GB&nbsp;partition storing a drive image of the hard drive as it came from the  factory, with Windows Me, Office 2000, McAfee Virus Scan 6, and everything else  that it had from factory. This was necessary, since it did not come with  everything on CD. What was not necessary was it's size, as the image is only a  1.65 GB file. This left with 700 MB of free space on that partition. That would  have worked out alright if it was large enough to use as a temporary folder for  burning CD's, however, for some reason I need 1 GB of free space to burn a  CD.This resulted in my having to move a lot of files around in order to burn a  CD, which was a real pain in the neck.     My first idea was to burn the drive image to a  couple of CD's, delete the files, and use Ranish Partition Manager to make  one&nbsp;large, single partition on my disk. A little thought in this area made  me see that I did not want to waste 3 CD-R's burning an image of old software,  when I have Windows XP, Office XP, Norton Anti-virus 2002, and other newer  versions of the software I use.     I then decided to repartition and reformat the  drive, install Windows XP and only the software I need, and then burn a drive  image of&nbsp;that configuration while it was as pure as the driven snow. I had  no idea of the problems it would cause.     The first problem I ran into was that my DVD  decoder software, while funtional after upgrading Windows XP over Windows Me,  would not install at all onto a Windows XP machine.     The second and most unnerving problem arose when I  attemted to activate this new installation of Windows XP.&nbsp;I ran the  activation wizard as usual, only after it connected to the internet, it  displayed a screen the likes of which I have never seen. I don't remember  everything it said verbatum, but I clearly recall the first line of the page.  "According to our records, the number of times you can activate Windows with  this product key has been exceeded." It then&nbsp;asked me to input a different  product key in the box below it.&nbsp;It did have a button underneath that said  "Activate by telephone". Upon clicking this button, I see that it has a toll  free number to call from if you are in the United States. Below this, it said to  select what country you are in to get an alternate number, and it had a  drop-down combo box beside that. Being that I am currently in Baghdad and a 800  number would still cost me 50 cents per minute. I knew that they would have me  on hold for a while before I started the inevitable lenghthy  process.     I immediately started drafting an e-mail to send to  Microsoft to express my dismay. The following&nbsp;is a copy of that  e-mail.      &nbsp;    What the hell is this?!!!     I cannot believe my eyes. "According to our  records, the number of times you can activate Windows with this product key has  been exceeded." What kind of slimy, dishonorable, communist, twinkle-toes,  morally depraved BS is this?!!! I am appalled. What in the hell are you bastards  trying to do, take every last dime you possibly can get your grubby little hands  on? Do you really expect me to buy another copy of Windows? I must inform you  money loving heathens:     ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU  CAN OVERCHARGE ME FOR A BUGGY, BLOATED, INFERIOR, OBSOLETE, WORTHLESS, UNSTABLE  PIECE OF SOFTWARE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED.      Who the hell do you think you are?!!! This is about  as American as th Taj Mahal! I would call and try to activate windows by  telephone, but a am currently honorably serving in my beloved country's armed  forces in Baghdad, Iraq. I don't think I need to explain to you how expensive it  would be for me to call you disreputable miscreants, especially since I know you  will have me on hold for an hour with all the other VICTIMS of your evil,  dispicable, tyrannical regime. YOU DON'T HAVE A TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR IRAQ, DO  YOU, YOU GREEDY AROGANT COLD-HEARTED BASTARDS?!!! No, of course not. Why not  scre over the very people that are fighting and dying for your protection? For  your liberty? For your right to right to rape the local economy of every last  shred of decency it has left? NO! I DRAW THE LINE THERE! YOU SORRY, NO COUNT,  VILE, CRUDE, CALLOUS, INSOLENT HOOLIGANS CAN KISS MY HAIRY WHITE BUTT.       I don't expect a reply from you morons. I'm not  worried about it. But I'm also not giving you one more cent. I never really  needed to pay you anything, but I did it out of decency. Things have changed.  What little respect I had for your organization just went out the window. I will  now go online and get one of the countless cracks that are available to bypass  your "activation." What I am upset with most is the fact that I am being forced  to go out of way to solve a problem that arose simply due to my periodic  reinstallation of Windows. If you are going to have this fascist stonewall in  place, either warn users before the installation, or make your operating system  capable of running for more than 6 months without swelling to rob nearly 3GB of  my limited storage. Those of us with 9.35BG laptop HDD's (It's 10GB raw...you  ****s) can't take this.      &nbsp;    After venting a little steam, I went to Microsoft's  website to find an e-mail address. I went to the support page, and clicked on  "Contact Us". What I ran into amazed me. I understood the first screen that said  that if your copy of Windows came with your computer, you would have to contact  your system manufacturer. Since my copy of Windows XP came from HP, I was  concerned. I did not want to contact HP, I wanted to scream at Microsoft. I hate  Microsoft. I like HP. I've owned HP computers and&nbsp;periphrials in the past,  and I currently own a laptop, desktop, and external CR-RW drive from HP. I've  rarely had a problem with anything, but when I have, HP fixed it rather quickly,  and in the case of this laptop, every time I've turned it in for service,  they've changed out more than I had proplems with and upgraded it for free.  Faster processors and the&nbsp;DVD-ROM were nice, but a new battery and hard  drive that they did not have to change was really nice.Anyway, since my copy of  Windows came in the mail separate from the laptop, I figured I was good.  Ignoring that screen, I continued to the e-mail tab. It did not simply show you  and address, but asked&nbsp;me to input&nbsp;my product ID. It said that if your  product ID contained "OEM", Windows came with your computer. Mine did. I put it  in any way. The next screen told me to contact HP. I could not even get an  e-mail address from them. I've bought several versions of Windows and other  things from Microsoft, I should be entitled to an e-mail address to send hate  mail.     I ended up posting this rant to their message  boards because that was the only way I could send them anything. Their message  board is not read by technicians at Microsoft, it is just a place to post a  question. If someone else is reading it (usually because they are posting a  question) and they know the answer or just want to say something else on that  topic, they can post a response. It is a good way of finding out how to do  things, but it would not solve my problem. I just wanted someone else to read  it.     I had already decided that I would just install a  copy of Windows XP Professional Edition that I aquired through a site license.  Site licesed software does not have to be activated. It is purchased by a  company to install on all of their computers, and they can make as many copies  as they need in order to install it on those computers. The US Army happens to  have one of those licenses, and since I use this computer for Army stuff mainly,  I have no problem using it.     Just when I had convinved myself to go about things  this way, I recieved a startling e-mail from HP. Aparently, someone at HP had  run across my little temper tantrum and invited me to go to HP's support webpage  for a live chat session with a technician. A copy of the Chat transcript  follows:      &nbsp;   Chat Transcript Begins  Here --------------------------------------------------------------  Paul Hello  Anthony Welcome to HP Total Care for Compaq Products. My Name is Paul.How  may I assist you ?   Anthony Whittington First, some  background   Anthony Whittington I recieved this computer through  the eArmyU program. It originally came with Windows Me installed on it, but in  the box was a card that said to go to Compaq's website, and you could request a  free upgrade to XP. I did that, and every was OK.   Anthony  Whittington The problem arose when I turned my computer in for  servicing.   Anthony Whittington They installed a new HD and put a  DVD-ROM in it.   Paul Okay   Paul Listening  carefully...   Anthony Whittington The first problem was in trying  to Activate XP when I reinstalled it. I used the Product Key off of the  Certificate of Authenticity on the bottom of the computer, but there was an  error message saying that "The number of times you can activate Windows with  this product key has been exceeded.

                     I was awakened about 1200 because we had been  alerted. Now I have a problem with being on QRF. It was all fine and good as  long as it did not effect my sleep. This was the second time in 24 hours. First  the SAS needs  backup,  now we have to go down to the local gas station  because there were reports of a disturbance over the (tell me&nbsp;if this makes  any sense) gas shortage.      There has been this gas shortage for the last few  days because of a broken line somewhere. The gas station about&nbsp;10 miles  down the road from our camp is one of the few in the city that are still open  for business. We were dispatched there the day before yestarday because the  owner was afraid of the crowd. He said that he had been getting threats when he  closed for the night. I would be upset, too, if I had waited in line for an hour  to get gas and he closed up shop on me.      By the time we got there today, the IP's already  had it under control. Oh well, back to camp.     We got back around 1300. That gave me 30 minutes to  get to the chow hall for some much deserved lunch. It was good, too. BBQ ribs,  corn on the cob, beans, and a salad. That caliber of chow is why I  reenlisted.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;

                     I have got to get me an alarm clock. After lunch, I  had nothing better to do, so I took a nap. I did not wake up until 1700, which  only gave me 30 minutes to get ready to go on our next mission.      The next mission was another boring one. Presence  patrol in 14E. It&nbsp;is these missions that I refer to as a parade.&nbsp;We  drive around and wave to all the waving Iraqis. It is mainly the children who  are doing the waving, accompanied by cheering and request for candy, money,  chemlights, or cigarettes. I still dont understand what a 12 year old kid is  doing smoking. How young do they start here?      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy sixth birthday, son.  Here's your first pack&nbsp;of cigarettes."     Muthana is one of the middle class districts of  Baghdad. It has its slums, some real nice neighborhoods, and some in between.  Everywhere except the real nice neighborhoods is trashy. And I do mean trashy.  Their standard garbage disposal process consists of dumping it in the street, an  open feild, or their front yard and setting it on fire. The people in the nicer  neighborhoods pay to have their trash trucked to the poorer neighborhoods and  burned.     The nice neighborhoods are nice. Many have  manicured lawns. Manicured is the only type of yard here. I guess if you can  afford to grow grass, you take care of it. The vast majority of the people just  rake their dirt/trash yard. The yards here are tiny. All of the houses have  shared walls, and the houses are generally about 8-12 ft off of the road. Also,  the norm is to have a stone wall around your yard in the nice neighborhoods.  Stone is the only type of wall here. When I say stone, what I mean this: They  take some bricks (no attention is paid to the size, condition color, etc.),  possibly 20 different kinds in one wall, and build a wall with just enough  mortar to hold them together temporarily. You can see through the wall at this  point. Then they skim coat the entire wall with an inch thick layer of mortar.  That is how every wall is made here. All of the floors are poured concrete. No  matter how tall the building. The chainlink fences are even put up on concete  poles. Wood is  SCARCE  here.      But as I was saying, the nice neighborhoods are  very nice. Many have marble driveways, ornate glasswork, beautiful wrought iron  railings, window bars, etc... Some of the most beautiful architecture I've  seen.     I have been sitting here waiting in line to get  online for the last 2 hours, and my turn is almost here. I'm going to send this  and go get some chow. I'll talk to you later.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;

                     Boring mission. We had another routine presence  patrol in 14E. It was just as uneventful as the last. We got back to the  barracks about 2200 and I decided to take a shower&nbsp;and a nap before our  next mission. Once again, I found myself having difficulty performing a simple  task because I could not take my mind off of Venus. I love you, honey bunny. I  love you so much. I miss you more every day.     It was a quick nap. Our next misson began at 0300,  so preparations started at 0030. We were tasked to provide backup for a group of  British SAS who were conducting a raid in our sector. That is what they told us.  We knew, however, that the SAS was more than capable of handling the situation.  We were there because they were in our sector and the Batallion Commander wanted  some of his guys there to keep an eye on them and to get any glory if there was  any extra lying around. They were going in to get a suspected insurgent and any  paraphenalia they could grab quickly. The plan was simple. We would roll up and  surround the block while the SAS ran up and did one of thier stealthy, lightning  fast, "knock down the door and make everyone play nice" routines. Then, two  little birds would land on the roof and pick the SAS and suspect up. It  shouldn't have taken more than two minutes, tops.      It looked really good. I did not see any SAS until  they were in the front yard, not that anyone was awake and would have seen them.  They came back out of the house about 30 seconds later saying that it was the  wrong guy. Bad intel again. The mission was a failure, but at least it was not  our fault. Of course, we would have had no effect on the outcome of the mission,  anyway.      We got back to the barracks before 0400. I was  hungry, but the chow hall was not going to be open again until 0630. I guess I  should have eaten before we left.

      We had another unenventful patrol today. Boring. And I had to miss chapel because of it. We did find a couple of people selling bootleg gas (actually, it's benzine) on the side of the road, which is illegal. We did the normal drill: Handcuff the suspect and destroy his containers. He had a tanker trailer of the stuff, so we just empty it out on the ground and slash the tires. I wish I would have brought my sword. We usually carry them to the IP (Iraqi Police) station when we are done, but we were late coming back in, so we scolded him as best we could in broken arabic, and let him go. He was happy. When we got back, I went straight to chow, and apon my return, played Scrabble with my driver, my squad leader, and his driver. I love that game. Friday, when we got back to the barracks from getting the A/C fixed, some guys were sitting up for a game of Scrabble. I was not at my best that day, and I came in second. Today I was I smoking them. I beat every one by at least 20 points. I hear everyone talking about the action that third platoon got into last night. They were set up around the Ministry of Agriculture building pulling security for a DAC (District Advisory Council) meeting. They said that about 12 mortors fell around them and they received a lot of small arms fire. PFC Peters was in the shower when it went down, and he hopped out, threw on his helmet and body armor, and returned fire with his SAW from the rooftop with the rest of his platoon. They don't know if it was they returning fire or Peter's naked ass that scared the insurgents off, but they drug their wounded into their vehicles and took off. Mission accomplished. I wish we would get some action.

                     This will be my last entry for awhile as we embark  on a lengthy mission this evening. Of course I cannot tell you what  we   are going to do, but I can tell you what  I  am going to do. I am going  to shoot some miscreant in the face. We should finally see some action. The sad  part about it is that we will not be alone. Even though there will  be&nbsp;Abrams and Bradleys there and they will no doubt be getting the most  action, I hope to at least do my part in this operation.      The funny thing is  that&nbsp;Dave,&nbsp;Joel,&nbsp;Drunk Mike, Freaky and I&nbsp;were just two days  ago sitting in the chow hall&nbsp;recounting fond memories of past experiences  in this fine Army. We sat and talked for several hours, even as the place closed  around us, each giving his best recollection of our more interesting times. When  all was said and done, we departed. As we lit&nbsp;began the&nbsp;43 mile trek  back to the barracks, we continued to smoke and joke until Joel said those  famous words, "I remember when we used to be tankers."      As I sit here,&nbsp;I am typing on one half of the  screen and watching the greatest tanker movie of all time:  The Beast.  I  cannot wait until that most&nbsp;glorious of days when I make my triumphant  return to my tank.     On&nbsp;a lighter note, the fiasco that is my  promotion is finally starting to look as if it will be handled. All that I am  waiting for now is the documents that I need to complete the reconstruction of  my promotion packet. That will be great.     I have a new request for supplies:      - Desenex Foot and Sneaker Deodarant     - OD Green 100 mpH tape     - Game Cube and accesories     - A new memory card for the Game Cube     - Mertoid Prime 2 for the Game Cube (It should come  out around Christmas)     I will finally have enough space for a Game Cube  since we will be moving into our new barracks Saturday. Since we will be leaving  this toilet of a barracks soon, I am going to document every little cramped,  decrepit inch of it. The pictures should be posted on Yahoo! soon.     The company should start rotating back to the  states a few at a time every couple of weeks starting at the end of June. I have  been slated to fly out on the next to last flight, which should be toward the  end of our tour if we get to go at all.     This morning I went to sleep around 2 am. I was up  for a while because we did not get back from our evening mission until about  1130 at night. I was for some reason thinking we were going to leave this  evening, so in preparation, I typed everything up until this paragraph. I am now  typing while waiting in line to access the internet. I cannot tell you how glad  I will be when I get to move into a real room with hot and cold running  internet.     By the time I went to sleep, I was not worried  about being tired because I figured I could just take a nap after our morning  mission. We had to be up at 0415 and it was my turn to wake up the platoon. I  did some quick thinking and realized that even though I was going to be dead to  the world 2 hours later when it would be time to wake up, I could still wake the  rest of the platoon up. I simply used Windows Scheduling Service to access  an&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;In a Hurry to Get Things Done  Mp3 file at 0415, set  the volume up all the way, and placed my laptop up above my bunk on the ledge so  that only I could get to it. Sure enough, I had three people waking me up at  0415. They were not happy, but at least they were up.     Our task this morning was a simple escort mission  followed by a "Mosque Monitoring" mission. We dropped the Commo guys that we  were escorting off at Camp Ironhorse, and proceeded directly to our favorite  mosque. We were there by 0600, so we hid the Humvees in the same place that we  have in the past, just down the road from the mosque. We were expecting morning  prayers to start at 0700. What we do is simple: we listen. First, the Imam  prays, then he invites everyone else to the mosque to pray, gives a little  speech, prays again, and it's over. All of this is blasted from LOUDspeakers  mounted on the top of those funny looking towers. We have an interpreter with us  who takes notes on what the Imam is saying, plus we record it onto an Mp3  recorder using a mic clip clipped to one of the antennas of the tank. We are  listening for anti-coalition sentiment being broadcast. Yessiree, Bob. Operation  Iraqi Fascism.      We sat there for a couple of hours and the prayers  never started. I didn't know what had happened, but I really did not care  anyway. I was tired. When we got back to base camp, all we had to do was clean  our weapons, reorganize and check the load plan, and perform preventive  maintenance checks and services on the truck. I planned on being done in an  hour. That was before all hell broke loose. I won't go into details about why I  have been BUSY since 0800 this morning, but it involves a new tie rod end and  enough ammunition to take over a small country.     That's about it for now. I will get back with you  all later this week. Peace. No, wait. War. Yeah, that's the  ticket.

                     I realized today that there are a few things that I  have left out of some of my previous posts.      Two things - the trip over here and my orientation  briefing when I got here - I will publish complete posts for. They will be back  dated so as to fit into the other posts chronologically, so you will need to  scroll down a bit in order to get to them.      As for the other additions, I will publish them  here in this post so they will be easily located. In addition, I will edit the  prevesious posts so as to reflect these changes. In the process, I will&nbsp;be  editing the previous posts for typograpgical, grammatical, literral,  chronological, and technical errors. I realized I have not been running the  spellchecker before I posted, so I will copy everything into MS Word so that it  can tell me how bad I type. In the future, I will type everything in MS Word  before I post them, so this should be the only time I do this. I will also be  modifying some posts for security reasons. (it now occurs to me that there are  benifits of this kind of journal I did not originally see)     When I am done editing, I will remove this post. At  that time I suggest you read the whole enchilada  one mo' gen .So without  further ado, let's dive in.      &nbsp;    --------      &nbsp;    About an hour before we rolled out the first time  to try to catch the mad mortarman, Freaky came by with a new addition to our  arsenal. Courtesy of the Army supply system, we now have Lasergrips from Crimson  Trace for our M9 9mm Berretta Pistols. They are relatively easy to install, but  we had to do it quickly so that we could roll out to our mission with them. All  you need is a flathead screwdriver to remove the plastic factory handgrips. Then  you place the included metal plate over the hole in the magazine well on the  right side so that the batteries don't fall into the magazine well, place the  two included quarter dollar sized batteries on the plate,&nbsp;install the new  grips onto the sides of the pistol, and place a little treehugger laser warning  decal underneath the sliderail. When you are done, the pistol looks stock save  for the rubberized grips, the tiny switch on the bottom of one of the handguard,  and the small bump protruding from the top of the right handgrip. The little  switch allows you to turn the system off when the weapon is stored so as to  prevent accidental battery drainage. Now, when you grip the pistol a laser beam  shoots beside the barrel out of that little bump on the side.     We've always had intimidating equipment. Some  examples: The Iraqis learned very quickly that although our Humvees are of  relatively small size they are uparmored and weigh a little ove 5 tons, which is  more than capable of pushing an Opel out of the way. When we are stopped in an  area in order to do something on the ground,&nbsp;often the locals start to  gather around the truck in order to converse, advise, beg, or try to sell  something to one of us. If they get to a point that someone feels that our  perimeter could be compromised, nothing clears the area better than charging a  shotgun. The LaserGrips are another exellent addition to that list.     While we were out there that night, we parked  quietly in a little wooded grove near our objective. We were trying to covert  (or as covert as you can with uparmored Humvees) when a man came peeking out of  his gate to see what was going on. You would not believe how quickly he ran away  when he noticed my red dot on his head. It also works well with dogs. They hate  lasers in their eyes.      &nbsp;    --------      &nbsp;    This blog will be available&nbsp;for everyone to  read, but I am primarily writing it towards Venus. I hope that everyone else  will understand. As I've said before, I've grown accustomed to being separated  from my family but I don't know if I will ever be at ease away from Venus. I've  never really been homesick before nor have I ever missed someone so much. I  would give up everything just to hold you right now.      &nbsp;    --------      &nbsp;    A few corrections to "the list" :      &nbsp;    - I don't really need a whole checkbook. I do  desparately need at least one single check  as soon  as&nbsp;possible . I guess I failed to convey this in the manner in  which it deserved, but I cannot convey the utmost urgency of my need of that  check. I plead to you now to do whatever it takes to get that in the mail with  ultimate priority.     - Snacks. Do not send doritos. I don't know why I  put that down. I can get doritos in the chow hall. What I cannot get is torrilla  chips and chili con queso.     - Feel free to send pictures via e-mail. I have  decent bandwith now and would love some pictures.     - Handcuffs, batons, etc...     - Whetstone. The only one I have here is 3/4 inch  by 1 1/2 inch. It is very difficult to sharpen my sword without cutting  myself.      &nbsp;    Additions:      &nbsp;    - A new head for my Braun 3612 Electric  Shaver.     - CR123A 3V Lithium Ion Batteries.     -                --------      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

                     I never did get that nap I was going to take. When  I got back to the barracks my platoon sergeant came to me. He asked if I wanted  to go to a Toby Kieth and Ted Nugent concert at BIAP. I told him that I hadn't  slept in a while, so I would rather just take a nap. He said that I was screwed  anyway, because we had just been called up to investigate a drive-by shooting in  our sector. It was mission or concert, and quite frankly I wanted to go shoot  someone. On top of that, there are four Toby Kieth fans in our platoon: Dave, my  driver, my machinegunner, and myself. My driver had been having a hard time  recently, and since there was only one seat, I sent him.      For the last several days my driver had been asking  me to drive the Humvee so that I could tell the mechanics what was wrong with  the suspension. With this in mind, I had my machinegunner man the M240 up top  and I was going to drive.     I had never driven an uparmored M1114 Humvee  before, and I have to tell you, it is fun. The first thing I noticed was that it  had a lot more power than your standard M998 Humvee. I had driven the M998 too  much to account for, and had driven the 2 1/2 ton M1097 Humvee on multiple  occasions. All military Humvees have&nbsp;a 6.2L (396 c.i.d.) Detroit Diesel  engine. The M998 is tuned so as to only have 156 HP&amp; 310 lb/ft of torque  and&nbsp;the M1097 is tuned for 189 HP &amp; 390 lb/ft of torque. The M1114 had  he same engine as the M1097, only with a turbocharger. Dave says that it only  has 190 HP, but it must have a hellacious amount of torque, because that thing  had some ass.     The second thing I noticed was that the rear view  mirrors were worthless, but it really doesn't matter when your driving an  armored truck. Dave ran a semi truck off the road with one of these things for  god's sake. Anyway, after we got off of the base camp with its 15 mpH speed  limit, it was on. It will go 0-60 in about 10 seconds, which is pretty  respectable for a truck that weighs over 5 tons.     Mounted on the sides of the truck are combat  indentification panels. They are rippled sheet metal panels about 2 inches thick  covered with reverse polarity thermal tape. I hate them because they rattle when  the engine idles. My plan was to come back to the camp short at least one CIP.  And some new white paint in a few spots wouldn't hurt either. I'm telling you,  turn me loose in a city with no traffic laws with an armored truck and  it's  on like a soup bone .     For the first half of the trip, trying to run  someone off the road or into something was fruitless. These Iraqi drivers are  agile little bastards. So for the second half of the trip, I just settled for  intimidating people. Things like riding 2 inches off of their bumper, swerving  from one side to the other so as to take up the entire freeway, or just rolling  through crowded city streets where there is just enough space for the Humvee to  squeeze through at 30 mpH. I had fun. Sadly, my luitenent won't let me drive  anymore. He thinks I went crazy and was trying to kill someone. But he's wrong.  I'm just shy of crazy as long as I am on my medication. I am trying to kill  someone, though.     When we got back to the barracks an hour and a  half&nbsp;later, my driver was already back. I told him&nbsp;that the truck  needs new shocks like the Hindenberg needed a fire extinguisher and that the  anti-sway bar on those trucks need to be about 6 sizes bigger, but other than  that, it's just a heavy truck. Upon inquiring why he was back so soon, he told  me that they had made a mistake. The concert was at 10 in the  morning . He  was a little upset, but he'll pull through. He's one of the two best soldiers in  this company. He's one ofmy soldiers.

      After that fiasco, we rolled right into services. That was 5 days of working LATE. It was not exactly fun, but neccessary. Anyway, my life has been really hectic from then until now. At one point I may catch you all up on what's been happening, but I'm not making any promises. But I will be writing a bit more often now. Hopefully I will get back into posting every day.

      I know it's been a while since I checked in, and I appologize for that.  I last told you that I would not be communicating much because we had some stuff going on. Well, that was interesting.  Sadr City was called Sadaam City up until we took over Baghdad. It was renamed last year to reflect its tribal Imam (pronounced E-Mom), Muqtada Al-Sadr. Needless to say, it's a bad part of town. The residents of Sadr City are Shi'ite Muslim extremists and all are pretty much loyal to Al-Sadr. It was so bad back when Sadaam was in power, he had the major streets widened in order to accommodate tank formations rolling through it. He used to do exactly that: roll tanks around and through the city. That's handy, considering that is what we do now. We have to. Anything less than tanks get shot up too much.   About 3 months ago, the 1st Cavalry Division came to town. When we first got here, the city was basically lawless, despite the presence of an Iraqi Police Station or two. The problem was that the IP's were in cohoots with the militants. Previously, Military Police were "providing security" of the area, but were'nt accually entering the place. They just drove around the outskirts. When 2nd Batallion, 5th Cavalry Regiment entered the scene, the MP's that were previously providing security have withdrawn due to heavy conflict (pansies), and local militants had overrun the Police station. The Black Knights (2-5) were dispatched to secure the area, and took heavy casualities. 2nd Batallion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (Stallions) were called up for reinforcements, and my platoon was escorted in by tanks and then set up a defensive perimeter on the roof. I was not there at the time, but the stories are widely known. One of my favorites was the one about the guy who stepped out of his front door with an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade), aimed it at one of the tanks, fired it, and hit a support for his front porch. Since this guy was like most Iraqis and was to inept to arm the thing before he fired it, it didn't explode. But it did knock his front porch right down on top of him. I know the guys who were in the tank he was trying to hit, and they said they saw him do this. They also said they were laughing too hard to shoot the guy. They said he crawled out of the rubble, threw his hands out, looked into the sky, and cursed something in Arabic. Then he turned around and went home.  My platoon ended up calling the Police Station they were guarding the Alamo, but it wasn't that bad. After a few days, they packed up and left the place with the MP's who had been drug back up there to watch place. It wasn't long before the place was overrun again.  The Black Knights gave up on leaving people there and settled with near constant patrols through the steets with their Bradley IFV's and our Abrams MBT's. It has been like that ever since, with multiple attacks on the patrols daily. It's not that big of a deal, since the most powerful weapon they have is RPG's and they only leave little scorch marks on the armor of our tanks. That's only when they hit them, which is rare, and only when they arm the warhead, which is rarer. Their ranks are slowly shrinking.  Jump forward to the present. A few weeks ago, we recived intel that Al-Sadr's Muqtada Militia had seen some serious attrition in Najef, Fallujah, and Karbala. His defences had fallen, his men were few, and they were logistically shorthanded due to our blockades. The plan, as it was heard, was to call up reinforcements from Sadr City to fill in his ranks in the south. Knowing this, we decided not to mess around anymore. We were going to take them out.  Then plan was simple. Task Force Stallion, TF Black Nights, TF Charger, and TF Eagle were going to stage outside of the city in the early hours of the morning. At a predermined time, tanks would come on line on the east side of town and roll through the center of town, traveling down every major roadway. This was to bring them all out and make them waste their time and ammo while the rest of the Combat Team cordoned off the City into 4 sections. An entire city of 1.6 million people was to be locked down with a heavily armed perimeter. No one would get in; no one would get out. This cordon was to be in place within a few hours, and them a Brigade's worth of the ICDC (Iraqi Civil Defence Corps - Iraqis we have recruited, trained, and armed to replace their army) would augment our perimeter. Then 1500 Iraqi Police from the friendly areas of Baghdad were going to roll in and search the entire place and "disarm" them. They were also there to disarm, disband, and replace the corrupt IP's. Each element had a sector of responsibility assigned to them. If the IP's had problems, that sectors element would roll in to regulate. The intent was to disband and disarm the militia, but we were briefed that they would fight to the last man. The entire operation was to take between 48-96 hours, then we would leave.  We prepared for every contingency. We packed enough supplies for a week. We rehearsed over and over and over. We were issued enough ammo to take over Moscow. And then we got word that some of the IP's had passed word of our plans to the MM, and they were preparing for us. Everyone was still willing to go, but some General decided it would be to dangerous, so it was called off. I know that they could not have prepared enough for our coming.
