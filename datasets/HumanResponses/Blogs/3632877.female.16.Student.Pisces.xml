        you used to call everyday..     message every minute.     we used to chat from night to the early morning before hanging up     even though we will see each other again in school.     &nbsp;

       life is fraught with choices.   choices which we have to make..   i hate making decisions   having to choose makes me sick.   its hard to decide sometimes..   times like now.   choosing to tell    or not to.   the consequences of my actions is something i'm afraid to face   at least now when i do not know the answer..   i have hope to cling on to   to hold on to...    &nbsp;  sometimes   i just wish i could read minds..   not all the time because that wouldn't be of any use anymore   but maybe for like now.   to help me out..    &nbsp;  to tell or not to.   if i could read minds now   i would know the answer   and to save myself the hassle and embarrassment of asking..   telling.   if only i knew the answer.   maybe i already do   but i just don't want to accept it..   accept the fact..   the truth.    &nbsp;  hope is a nice thing to hold on to..   maybe i'll just hold on to it for the time being.   you know..   its not that bad.   better than rejection right?   hope is good for me...   besides..   we are too different   he says.   that kind of shows doesn't it?   well so for now   i guess hope is good..   well good enough for me i suppose.   better than hurt.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       i like to&nbsp;lie to&nbsp;myself sometimes..    lessens the pain for awhile.    just a little..    even then    its still a little...    these are my painkillers.    shrouding my eyes    to keep me from seeing the reality.    it kind of works sometimes..    numbs the pain a little.    the hurt.    the rejection.    i know its over..    but i like to lie to myself that its not so.    i'd like to think that there is still a chance for me.    us.    but i know there isn't..     &nbsp;   what i wouldn't give to start over again.    you have me wallowing in self-doubt...    if only i could have another chance.    it would probably be different    or not.    i guess you were plain foolish when it came to me.    bad choice huh.    guess this thing is    my fault too right?    shouldn't have bullied you..    sorry.    i feel like laughing   right now    but it seems inappropriate...     &nbsp;   whether you do or you don't..    i still evol you.     well it seems quite late to actually think about all this..    but recently everything has been coming back    and i realised that i still did ekil you.    sorry for whatever wrong that i did.    guess its kind of late right..     &nbsp;   haha.    inappropriate right..    couldn't help it.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

       i wish i could get you to give me a call...    i just want some questions answered thats all.    i typed a long entry    about everything..    about how i felt.    my doubts.    but blogspot decided to eat it up.    i'm feeling so angry right now..    my time was wasted.    argh.    guess maybe i have no more chance at all...    that entry was fated to be gone i guess.    maybe it was a sign for me to forget...    i don't know.    i need to hear it from you.    but when will i ever dare to tell..     &nbsp;    &nbsp;
