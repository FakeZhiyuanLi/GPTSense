        why can't i forget him? well, yesterday morning, i was thinking: "why couldn't i stop loving and thinking of him?" (sounds like a loser, huh? yah right..) but seriously how can i forget someone who had shown me that life has the best to offer like happiness? yup.. i have never been happy until i was with him.. but now? what am i? back to the same old me, the one who pretends to be strong and always happy... it's so damh hard to think whether he's thinking of me or not.. whether he still loves me or not.. some say love is the best feeling in the world.. but they forgot that it could also be the worst.....

        febuary 18, 2002       the day i had my first ever boyfriend.. i wasn't  madly in love with him that time but i felt something for him..   we barely talk in school nor on the phone.. only thru text messages for  about 4 months? (including the summer break) wonderin how we didn't  break up?.. i dunno.. but when classes of 2002 came, something  changed.. we then talked in school, well, not that much but at least we  do.. then as days/months passed, we talk more and more.. and guess  what.. i totally fell for him.. i have loved him since that time.. love  as in like he was my world..       after 6 months       we spend each day together. we talk on the phone  more often..  i actually forgot the exact day when he first held  my hand but that moment was still clear on my mind.. i was about to go  home so he walked me to where i will ride fx.. and while waiting, he  held my hand.. that was one of the happiest moments of my life..   honest.. i was so happy that time..      september 2002       the month when we celebrate our birthdays. his on  the 8th and mine on the 20th.. (i actually dont know when we started to  go home together, first he sends me to my house then he goes home..  which was really costly for him, i should say, coz he lives near in our  school..) eniwei.. this was also the month when we first went out  together but with his friends.. we watched a movie but didnt sit next  to each other..       december 2002       december 5 when he first kissed me.. not on the lips  but somewehere above the cheek and right in front of his bestfriend  while they were talking.. i was quite surprised coz his bestfriend and  also my friends were there.. but he didn't care.. that's why i adore  him.. i so love him.. this was also the month (i think) when we first  watched a movie together.. i think that was "mano po".. hehe.. after  that, we usually go to the mall during weekends to watch a movie..      *i find it really hard to narrate this on exact months so ill just tell it in paragraph form.. sori*          during those times, i can say that our love was  strong.. we spend each day together and when we get home, we talk on  the phone..  first kiss.. on the lips i mean.. i forgot when (but  i still remember how it happened hahaha) eniweis, that was so great..  hehe..      february 18, 2003       our first year anniversary...  i still remeber  how i bought my gift for him.. he was with me, he picked the shirt.. (a  really nice guess shirt) which i said tazha asked me to buy. (for  alvertte? i dunno, i dont remember it na...) hahaha.. then before we  went home.. i told him that it was actaully for him.. (blame my  talkativeness..) he thought i was just joking but i told him im not..  that was really funny hahaha.. well on exactly the 18th, we stayed at  his friend's house (because his other friend celebrated his birthday  and instead of going to the mall we decided to come to his friend's  house) we ate pizza (a treat of paolo zafra)..  then he gave me a  gift.. a bracelet and a shirt.. that was really sweet of him..           after that, we were okay.. constant talking on the  phone.. text messages and every communication u can think of.. then we  had problems like he being jealous of joshua velez, which was my crush  in grade 6.. but that was in grade 6 and he wont believe me that i have  no feelings for joshua.. i told him that we were just close friends but  still, he didnt believe.. so what i di was try to convince him.. i  dunno if he was but at least the war about joshua had finished.. im NOT  really in love with joshua because it was him who i love, with my whole  heart..          during summer, we saw each other every week (at  least once).. we watch movies and spend a great time together.. when he  was in province, we talk thorugh text and when i miss im, i call him..  at the latter part of the summer, he attended this workshop (reason why  we barely saw each other) at first i was ok with me, until the time he  spent more of his time with his friends there.. of course il get  jealous.. who wouldn't be??? at times when i call him, he wont call me  back.. or he wasnt at home.. then il just know that he went to the  mall.. without me knowing it at all.. then one time, he told me he had  a crush on this girl.. but said it was only "crush" (maybe because he  doesnt see me often,, he said) but how can we see each other if he goes  there even if it's not in his schedule?? (gosh i forgot when we first  broke up, coz we were always fighting about when.. he says it was on  the 4th but i told him it was the 5th! gosh.. i cant remeber!!) eniwei,  it was the first week of june when we broke up.. i didnt cry that much  because i was so mad at him.. so mad.. but when i saw him in school, i  cried.. i still love him.. that was really painful.... so i asked him  if hed agree for us to be together again but he refused.. i cried every  night because of him..          he had a gf  4 mos after we broke up.. i was so  hurt but i didnt want him to notice it. they were together for only a  motnh.. and guess what? we were togther again.. it happened when we  always talk on the phone on the 3rd week of november.. he asks me for  help coz he doesnt love christina anymore and told me that i was the  one he really loves.. and since i love him so much, i accepted him..  right on the day when they broke up...           at first, it was a secret.. but we couldn't hold it  anymore so we just let everybody know.. we dont care.. as long as we  were together.. i think i was the happiest person that time.. our love,  (like he said)  was then in a higher level.. and i agreed.. our  love was like a stone, no one can break it unless it could be thrown or  really planned to be broken.. we were so happy..  more problem  crossed our path but we overcame it--together, we had our cool-off  twice (i think) and a day of not talking.. things like that.. but we  still managed to let our feelings reign.. i gave him everything hat he  wanted (for me, it was that way..) but again, after only 4 mos.. we  broke up.. the 7th of march 2004..          he had a gf (i think during march-june) his ex-gf..  i was so hurt.. but i just kept it.. i made him thhink that i dont love  him anymore.. but again,  i was the one who was fooled, no matter  how i try to hide my feelings, the more i realize that i love him..          and now, here i am.. still it was 4 mos ago when we  broke up, but im still loving him so much.. i cant continue this na coz  m already crying and besides.. it is so painful.. i love him and he's  the only one i could think of each and every day of my life..
