      Hehehe.. - an awfully familiar expression, don't you think?? I think most of the people in my Yahoo Messanger list agree.. I use this expression for about twnety times a day.. I use this expression in chat, sort of like a line to keep the conversation going.. And, I also use this expression in my blogs, some of my friends also use this expression in their blogs.. One is Elaine who used the expression: "Hehehe" three times in her latest entry.. Hehehe..   Hehehe...  That's all.. BTW, I used the expression: "hehehe" six times in this entry...  Velasco, OUT!!

      The pesky periodicals are over!! Yey!!! The past week has been one of the longest week of my life.. Imagine waking up 4 30 in the morning just to review A.P.. Imagine washing your face every thirty minutes just to stay awake to study L.E., the music treatment didn't work..   Our test in A.P. was somewhere between easy and moderate, apparently, the freak wasn't the one who made the test..   I had lunch with my classmates in elementary.. Man, I wish hanging out with those guys.. They surprised me with the major changes in their school life, one of them already has a girlfriend.. But, Benjamin, the one from II-6, haven't changed a bit.. He is still immature, and he was our laughing stock.. Hehehe.. I'm looking forward to hanging out with them again..   After hanging out with my former classmates, I joined my present classmates.. That's when my day starts to fall apart.. My classmates are all seated and I tried finding a seat, then I saw an empty chair at the last table.. Actually, It was not empty, there were bags there. I asked my classmates if they own the bags.. Nobody claimed it, so I decided to slam that chair at the side and replaced it with an empty chair for me to sit in.. I guess I chose the wrong time to slam that chair, because the owner of the bags were there... She was an old woman and she looked at me as if I killed an innocent baby.. I was freaking!! I didn't know what to do... My conscience ate me, eventually I apologized to the person...  That was just the first part of the torture.. I was late for my chinese class, and my teacher was furious!! She said that I'm irresponsible!! Because I haven't recited the summary of the movie, tarzan, for her.. And she said that I have no reason to be late!! Whatever..   Then she distributed the test papers, I didn't expect high grades.. But I messed up an essay.. I was confused, my answer was for a diiferent question.. So, I lost eight points.. GRRRRR....  Second recess came, the best part of the afternoon, I went to my classmates.. Thinking that they might relieve my burden.. I felt so much better.. But the down part is, I didn't noticed the time, so I came late for the third period.. And my teacher has gone ballistic!!! She said: you're the first one to go out!! And you're late!! Actually, there were more.. Fortunately, I didn't understand the next words!!! Hehe... I devoted the rest of my third period counting the minutes before the bell.. It felt like a month!! Then, I heard the most beautiful sound, I heard the bell!! (translation: yeeeeey!!) I felt like a newly released prisoner..  I thought that my bad luck was over, I thought wrong!! I still have to hide from Sir Judelio, I am hiding from him because of my untidy haircut.. grrr....  Then, I saw Jill, Toni, Kim Carmela and Michelle... I joined the group.. And a Chinese teacher approached us.. She was the weirdest teacher I have ever seen!! She talked to us with PASSION... She laughs after every sentence.. The teacher left us and talked to Jill's mom.. Then, the weird teacher laughed histerically!! She was laughing with PASSION.. it was the fuuniest thing I have witnessed!! I laughed and laughed...  My day turned upside-down... I was smiling all the way to my house!!  That's all  Velasco, OUT!!!

      We took our biology, technology and values ed. periodicals earlier...   Biology is really a pain in my butt, I concentrated on studying the "cell" and most of the foreign scientists. And, the test barely touched those topics.. It was all about potato!!   POTATO - We were asked to draw a slice of potato when soaked in different solutions!!Man!! We are living in th 21st centrury!! Would it help if every Filipino citizen knew the answer? Would it feed the hungry? Would it shelter the homeless? Would it improve our economic status??    Then came along technology, it was not that hard, I finished the test more or less in 40 minutes.. I spent the reamaing minutes sleeping.. ZZzzzz...  In breaktime, I went to my locker to get my Geometry book.. And I heard my classmates memorizing the "panatang makabayan".. I thought that it was included in our test so I joined the mini-conference.. Came to think of it, why do they have to revise the pledge of allegiance? It would only confuse the students who have already memorized the first version.. I mean, they hardly changed the meaning..  Then came values ed.. It turned out that the "panatang makabayan" is not included.. Instead, they've included the vision-mission statement.. We were ask to sort out the values shown in the following statements, values that are mentioned in the vision-mission.. I took me a while to finish that portion., I'm not really sure if my definitions of righteousness and propriety are correct..  PROPRIETY - pro路pri路e路ty - noun  1.  socially correct or appropriate behavior: conformity to the standards of politeness, respect, decency, or morality conventionally accepted by a society   2.  quality of being socially appropriate: quality of displaying behaviors thought to be correct or appropriate    Righteous - right路eous - adjective 1.  strictly observant of morality: always behaving according to a religious or moral code   2.  justifiable: considered to be correct or justifiable    Whatever!! All I know is that I hate our values ed teacher!! She enjoys seeing other people suffer.. She's a freak!!  Potato, Propriety and Righteousness - put them all together and I will explode!!

      Monday's Biology test is drawing closer.. Everybody is  studying and everything and I just wasted a day!! I have done nothing productive.. Here's an outline of my day..  around 8:00am - I woke up.. My mom told me to study but I'm not in the mood.. So I opened the tv and watched cartoons, MYX etc.. (You can't blame me.. It's more fun to watch cartoons than to study Genetics)  around 9:00am - I opened the fridge.. I found no leftovers from yesterday so I ate a bowl of milk and cereals instead.. While watching tv of course (MMmm... I haven't eaten a bowl of cereals in days)  around 10:00am - I opened the computer.. I wanted to post a new entry but I have nothing.. (For those who are online, I'm in invisible mode)  around 12:00noon - It's lunch-time and I'm starving... I usually eat heavy breakfasts, in this case, I just ate cereals.. so I ate, ate and ate.. (Burp... Excuse me..)  around 1:00pm - I tried to study.. For 5 minutes, I find the atmosphere too quiet so I played my favorite songs.. Guess what, I just sang with the player and didn't study.. (Again, You can't blame me.. The song "She Will Be Loved" is really catchy..)  around 1:30pm - I'm getting tired of singing, I opened the tv again.. I lied on my bed and watched National Geographic. (just a trivia: The animal with the most number of teeth are the dolphins)  around 2:00pm - My eyelids are getting heavier.. Have I told you that I have the tendency to be sleepy with a full stomach... (ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)  around 5:00pm - I woke up.. I decided to check my brother.. My mom told me to help him review.. But he's already finished reviewing..  (I'm the best tutor in the world!!)  around 7:00pm - My mom got home.. I pretend teaching my brother.. Hehe (can't wait for the "payday")  around 8:00pm - It's dinner-time!! My second favorite time of the day.. Mmmmm.. (My mom sure can cook!!!) (Lunch-time is first..)  around 9:00pm - I was composing the same entry.. but I accidentally pressed back.. so, I have to start over.. Laugh all you want!!! (translation: ughhh!!)  now - I'm getting sleepy again..  Well, early to bed, early to rise.. I need lots of time to study tomorrow!!  VELASCO, OUT!!!

      This is the name of our section, actually it is not official but I think outcast has the most votes.  Our class have changed. I used the word "have" in the previous sentence cause there's no more unity. I don't know what happened to the usual chinese dismissal get together, or the usual Contry Chicken/ Chef's Delight saturdays.   Now, there's backstabbing, hating and I don't know if there are worse things in the classs happening that haven't reached my ears and eyes. I feel like going to the world war 3 everytime I go to school. What happened?   There's no one to blame, everybody has their own share of mistakes. I think that it is not too late to mend things up, its not too late to put things in the right order.   Think about it, we cannot live our three remaining years in high school like this..

      Here is my first blog. Well, I'm not sure if I can consider this a blog, aside from the fact that it is very short, it also contains no useful information.. I tried finding the word "blog" in my dictionary to know if this entry is considered a blog, but even my dictionary is ignorant about he concept of a blog. Then, I tried to consult yahoo by typing the word "blog" on the search bar, and yahoo served me several results.. Here's one of them:    What's a blog?
