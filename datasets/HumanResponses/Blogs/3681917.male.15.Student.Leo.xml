      I am preparing for my wonderful trip to conn. for a family golf tourney this weekend. Its gonna be soooo cool! But anyways I spent half the day over at Ashley's house...man her mother was acting so wierd. Normally she acts like she wants to kill me but today she offered a slice of pizza.....it was SOOO wierd!  i am still working on my nusuni.com page layout...actually I probly wont work on it until i get a new computer. If imac g5's come out on monday (or even 1.5 ghz g4) and if they are shipping now I might pick one up! Elseif (you can tell im a programmer :D) I am going to get a emac g4 with a minivga to vga adapter (gonna dual monitor :D) and get an extra 512 megs of ram off crucial! Its gonna be my baby :D (Ashley..i dont mean it that way... i still love u!)

      Today I practiced golf for a tourney this weekend with my relatives. So i was hitting wiffle balls around and one went into a patch of tall grass and weeds....I got very mad and literally started destroying the weeds...i finally got the ball back. Now a whole chunk of the patch of weeds is missing...it looks kinda funny. But anyways...I worked on a beta layout for my nusuni.com site. The picture of it is on  urlLink This Page !

      Well another boring day has passed....well wait a second it was father's day.... Besides that it was pretty boring...another day of gameboy and computer. We had to pick some people up at the airport....to get home the highway was closed and that forced us to drive through the *gulp* ghetto. Man I hate the city....

      Hey all, my name is Jeremy and this is my blog....I finally got around to starting one...go figure im a busy kid (i own http://www.nusuni.com ....yes I am the same kid that made the very popular app IPer). I started this little blog in an attempt to get my name out. A friend and I had a crazy idea to become one of those opinionated radio talk show hosts. I figured this is a good start. As for now...well I am busy waiting for my new mac tomorrow :D. Busy folding proteins for the Folding@home project as well. Don't think my poor little computer can handle constant 111.2 degrees F for much longer. But anyways, cant wait till tomorrow...if i get a new one pics will be posted right away :D
