						   Today i walk to the general office with full of joy.. cos i m going in to take my subject dropping form.. some may think my decision is stupid.. but i think it is great to drop.. cos it is so useless after all.. can it be use for my future? NO!!! it can't.. so wat is the point of studying it.. although i have a little regret but it is my future which is more impt, not the present.. hu cares if i take f math n finally i fail the rest.. won it be more disgraceful then now dropping my f math? so i think it is the right decision.. tomol i will hand in my form.. it is my FINAL DECISION...
