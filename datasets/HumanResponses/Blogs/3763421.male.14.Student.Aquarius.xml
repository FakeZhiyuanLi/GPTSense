      Exams were over last Friday. My friends and I went to The Summit to watch movies at 2.30. All of them wanted to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (some of them had seen it already, they just wanted to see Emma Watson ¬_¬) while another friend and I headed off to watch Around the World in 80 Days. This is the first time I watched a Jackie Chan movie in theaters :P It was a nice movie. Some comedy and action touches here and there.  Our movie started and ended earlier than PoA. Afif (my friend who watched AtWi80D with me) wanted to try out the Xbox, so we headed off to a gaming shop nearby and paid RM4 for an hour of gaming. He played Ninja Gaiden. I tried it for a few minutes too. Nice graphics, and Hayabusa is good as a ninja. Around 6.00, PoA has finally ended. The group still haven't came out yet, so Afif and I headed to a comic shop where I bought two Penyiasat Remaja comics and an FFVIII wall-scroll (whee~). We moved on to another gaming shop where I bought Silent Hill 4: The Room, Onimusha Warlords, Onimusha 3: Demon Siege and Fatal Frame.  We headed back to the cinema and found the guys playing in the arcade ¬_¬ We walked around a bit till 7.45 then we went back home.  I spent my one month pocket money on this day T_T

      Eight of my friends and I went for a school-organized trip to Pusat Sains Negara and FRIM (Forest Research Institute of Malaysia) with 31 different students (excluding us) and two teachers last Wednesday. We went off on a school bus that fits all of us in at 8.30 a.m. The bus has air-conditioners above every seat and even has two small televisions and an installed VCD player XD  While on the way the to PSN, I listened to the songs that I burnt on a disc using my friend's discman. This is the first time I went for a school-organized trip and it's a hell of a lot of fun and a great experience. We reached there at 10.00 a.m. and we were ordered by our tour guides (a girl name Celester and a guy whose name was not mentioned) to be back at the entrance by 11.30.  My group walked to all corners of the place, seeing the displays there about space, technology, plants, animals, etc. At one point, there were two "instruments" that played music from FFX and FFVII! The best part of this trip was this Artificial Intelligence (AI) computer that has a programmed voice and will answer to anything we type on the computer. Of course, we typed in "dirty" questions and she responded something like, "Be polite", "Dream on", "I can't answer your question right now. I'm still learning". "Dirty" questions as in "What's your breast size?', "Will you **** me?", "Can I see you naked?". Of course, I didn't type nearly all of these questions :P  At 11.30, we went back to the entrance and since not everyone was there yet, we went to the convenience store nearby and bought myself a RM2 silver ring that was a bit too big for my fingers (I was in a hurry and did not see if it fits me, since the tour guides are rushing us). After that, we went to the butterfly park and the rabbit park. There were a few rabbits that were just two days old and they looked so small, so weak...  Later, we continued to our main purpose of this journey, to visit FRIM. We reached there at 12.30 p.m. and had our lunch there (rice with spicy chicken and vegetables and a plastic glass of orange juice). A few of my friends threw bones and pieces of chicken meat to the river and we saw a group of fishes rushing towards them and eating them up o_O Yeah, they eat bones too XD  Once we were done, we headed to the museum and were introduced to an old Chinese man that were supposed to be our guide for this trip. After a boring half an hour there listening to his speeches about trees and FRIM, we started our most exciting part of this whole journey, jungle-tracking.  We stopped a few times here and there to look at tall trees and listening to the man's lectures. The journey got harder and harder, and the paths got steeper and steeper. Finaly, we reached a "pondok" and we were told that we had just walked 1 kilometre o_O After resting a few minutes, we were told that the rest of the journey will be tougher since the paths will be getting a lot steeper than before and that those who felt tired on the way must not over-strain themselves. After a few minutes, I reached the destination point (I was one of the fastest, probably the 10th person to reach there while the remaining 30+ people are WAY behind me).  There was another "pondok" here, only that this "pondok" leads to a canopy bridge (bridges that are made out of planks hung mid-air by staircases from one point to another with ropes for one to hold on to and nets to prevent one from falling). We entered the "pondok" one by one, after we were given another lecture (the lecture lasted about 10 minutes and YET the 30+ people were no where to be sighted XD). We entered the "pondok" (guy-girl order).  It has been a long time since I walked on a canopy bridge. Once I reached the checkpoint, another friend and I waited for another friend to reach the checkpoint, letting the girls and guys continue on without us. At this point, I noticed that I lost my silver ring =.= Later, the three of us walked together and we walked on the same plank, causing people below who have finished the canopy bridge journey yelling at us (we were supposed to walk with a distance of three planks between us). The bridge was shaking tremendously and it was funny XD  Once we touched the ground, Celester mentioned to a few of us that no matter how many times a person has walked a canopy bridge, he or she will still feel a slight fear in himself or herself, unless he or she is not afraid of death. Interesting point... Usually, Malaysians never talked about philosophy...  Then, a race struck between my friends and I to reached the ending of this journey. Jumping over rocks, crossing rivers, running down steps, I finally got third place XD  The clouds are getting darker, and it began to rain. We hurried on board the bus and reached back to our school at 4.30 p.m. It was a great journey indeed :D  I took some pics today for you guys to see. It's my FFVII: AC and FFVIII wall-scrolls. They looked a bit blurrish, though.

      My grades have been degrading lately, which means I won't be online much and thus I would not be able to update this blog as often as I like.  Life could get pretty boring at times. I could only use my PS2 during the holidays, and I have lots of unfinished games to play. Playing RO everyday could get a bit tedious, especially now that I'm pretty close to reaching level 99 (I'm level 89 at the moment, as my Huntress).  I wanted to try something new, and thus made up my own character for RPing at the Advent Children boards (I'm still waiting for it to get approved). Sometimes, I wish that nobody stays at my home (yes, I love privacy, a lot). I hate having people (especially family members) surrounding me and distracting me all the times. I just wish I could get out from this house, buy a motorbike with unlimited fuel and lots of money, and travel the world ala Kino in "Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World". Though I doubt the world is beautiful now, what with all the pollution and war happening...  Yep, my ambition is to travel around the world learning new things and meeting different people and culture.

      I got poor results for my second term exam (so far I have 1A, 1B and 2Cs)... I just hate studying.  Went to watch Spider-Man 2 with a friend at Summit yesterday. We reached there at 2.00 p.m. and bought the 5.00 p.m. tickets (THX). We killed time by playing Need for Speed: Underground and FIFA Soccer 2004 in a gaming store. When our time runs out, we played Time Crisis II at the arcades.  Spider-Man 2 is great. It may not have as much action as the first, but the story provides more depth into Peter's emotions and problems. I just SO wish that the next movie will feature Venom (though I think this is impossible).  Bought two Penyiasat Remaja comics after that and a Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children wall-scroll.  My friend invited me to his house today to play PS2 (at my time of posting) but my mom asked me to study instead. Oh well~ I'll be doing my Maths homework and BM essay after I finished typing this, which will be ended with a full-stop.  Last Wednesday, when I finished my school's co-curricular activities, I noticed that the north sky is filled with dark clouds and the south sky is bright and surrounded by white clouds. It kind of make me feel that the world will never have a pure good or evil side, that the world must always have a balance of Yin and Yang, Good and Evil, Light and Dark.
