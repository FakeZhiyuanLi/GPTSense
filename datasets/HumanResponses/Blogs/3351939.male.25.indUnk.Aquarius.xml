      Just as the title says.  It is Monday, and unlike some people who have to get up and go to work...I have nothing to do but sit on my ass all day and do absolutely nothing!  It is the greatest thing in the whole world!  Today's scheduale includes a bit of web surfing, followed by some City of Heroes, followed by television, a nap, and other stuff...don't want to think TOO far ahead! :)

      So it is the day after the party.  Nobody got stupid drunk, which is nice, and I got to sleep in until noon, which is even better.  I am at my girlfriend's house, this is my second home on the weekends.  My best-friend James is downstairs with the twins watching tv.  I just had to take Chloe outside, Chloe is a 1 year-old german shepard.  My girlfriend is at her uncle's graduation and I am starving.  I'd eat, but we are going to a barbeque later, which should have lots of food!  Anyways...going to take a shower now...talk ta y'all later.

      So I just posted my first blog a little under an hour ago, and had the sudden urge to write again.  I have been scanning over all the different posts and what not.  Some interesting people out there. ;)  I am mearly waiting to gain the will to get up from this chair and start getting ready for the rest of the day.  It is about a quarter to 3 and I told my girlfriend I would be over to her house by 4:30, and that just is NOT going to happen.  The fact is, I don't feel like getting up at all.  I feel like just sitting in this nice comfy seat, only getting up to use the bathroom, and doing absolutely NOTHING for the remainder of the day.  I could say, in my defense, "Why try to make something of the day now, when the day is closer to being over than I am of being ready to start it."  It doesn't make a lot of sense, but my girlfriend usually falls for that sort of thing.  But either way...I think it is time to go, for real this time. :)  Have a good weekend, folks...stay out of trouble.

      Greetings internet community.  My name is...well the name I am going to go by is SuperLobster.  I am 25, and I live in a town called Palos Hills, which is a southwest suburb of Chicago.  I am not going to sit here and write out my likes and dislikes, because I believe that would be boring.  If you want to know what I like and what not, just check out my profile.  Anyways...this is my first blog...ever.  I am not exactly sure what to say.  It is exciting and thrilling, in a way, to just put my self out there for people to read.  I am having a hard time writing this, because I am typing with only one hand.  (GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER!!!)  My other hand is busy holding the watermelon I am eating while trying to talk to all of you.  The watermelon, for those who are wondering, is not very ripe, and although pretty good, not as sweet as it should taste.  So a friend of mine just recieved his masters degree in something or another.  I'm not too sure.  Ok...maybe to say he is a friend is a bit of a stretch.  Let's call him an acquaintence.  His cousin has a decent sized house, and usually throws parties there a few times a year.  The only problem is that they are the most BORING parties in the entire world.  There is drinking, and good food, but the music is this crap the cousin made which everyone tells him is really good, but totally sucks.  There are only about 4 girls in a crowd of 15+ guys, and 2 of the 4 is made of my girlfriend and her sister, who is also dating my best friend.  Following me? ;)  Anyways, the other sister, (they are twins), does not have a boyfriend, and the other girl at these events is usually some random girl who someone managed to build up the courage to bring who is bored out of her skull.  Well since the parties are so boring, everyone drinks and drinks... And at these parties is this guy named Kevin.  Now Kevin is a twin, but he is more of the Black Sheep of the two.  He gets super drunk in usually under 2 hours and just starts to hit on all the girls...even my and my best friend's.  Now unfortunately, Kevin is very good friends with all of us.  He is really a good guy, but he just can not handle his liquor.  So every time one of these events happen, the girls have to be moved around to avoid the inevitable, "Hey girls...wwhatss up?"  Followed by rude stares at the chest and just mumbled incoherent speech.  Now some of you are saying how disgusting that is, and maybe a couple of the guys are thinking I should just kick his ass, but of course the girls just shake their head and say that he is harmless and just drink.  Even though this activity ruins the night every time for each of them.  Anyways...just had to get that off my chest.  I think tonight I will get a little toasted and go off on him as soon as he starts up, that way I can just blame being in a crabby mood and also being intoxicated.  Thanks for the taking the time to read my first Blog, for those who stuck around, and any comments are definitely welcome.  See ya soon!
