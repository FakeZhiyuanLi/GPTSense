      I would just like to say that Orange Juice is the best ever.  I don't think Ambrosia could be so quenching as my beloved OJ.  Yessir.  As I've until now forgotten to mention on my blog, I stole my grandfather's guitar last week with the intention of learning to play.  Yes, I know, Jared playing guitar seems silly, but I've gone entirely too long outside the loop.  It being a week or so later, I'm picking up on it pretty quickly, as far as I can tell (which isn't very far, considering I know next to nothing about the thing).  More to come as I figure the thing out.  Looking for colleges is depressing.  I just keep thinking, "Well, I might have been able to get into that college if I hadn't screwed myself over with bad grades."  Let me just say that I'm studying my butt off for the SAT (which I'm taking again June 5, dear Lord, too soon), in hopes of proving that I am mildly intelligent.  I am also practicing bassoon out the tail in hopes of getting lots of money for college.  Money for college = good.    Because of recent developments, it looks like I will be able to go to BOA this year.  For those not in the know, my Mom's car exploded a few weeks ago, which is, to say the least, mildly taxing on the bank account.  But things are working out, and a huge stroke of luck may allow me to go.  I can't wait.  Should be pretty uber.    Otherwise, a pretty boring summer.  But it's a good boring.  Like a, "Hey, I don't have to write a research paper, or avoid studying for an exam, or read a bland APUSH book," kind of boring.  And I'm happy with that.  Although, I do have SAT to study for, then I have to study for A+ (computer nerd test), so I'll have something, at least, to occupy me.  Woo!

      Okay, first post on the new blogger thingo.  As background for newcomers:  I had my own website for several years, then got too lazy to maintain it.  Plus, I wanted a the little comment feature thing, and I didn't want to have to deal with all the HTML involved.  So I'm on blogger, now.  Anyway, here's the post.   Last day of school today, and it was sort of boring.  Mrs. DeGroat was doing graduation practice, so she told us with the most tact she could muster not to show up today.  So I went with Dakota to journalism and screwed with macs.  Second block was band.  He gave us an exam, then posted Drum Major.  CONGRATULATIONS, Nichole.  (hums a Paul Simon song)  I'm nearly done with  Life, the Universe, and Everything , book three of five in the increasingly inaccurately named  Hitchhiker's Trilogy .  Great books, truly.  I let Lori borrow the first one, and she says she's loving it.  I'll write some sort of review on the whole trilogy at some point, for your entertainment.    I would also like to commend Blogger for adding the  Spell Check  feature.  ALL blogs should employ this nifty piece of technology.  No, really.   DISCLAIMER: Future posts should be more interesting.  I just needed some words to put here to show that I exist.

      Had a fantastic time at BOA, and more than glad to be home.  It's taking me twice as long as it should to type this, because I'm out of practice.  How sad is that?    I LOVE BASSOON! (And just in time to start playing sax for marching band.  What timing I have.)  But really, this instrument is the awesomest ever.  We're talking up there with bari sax.  Yeah, that good.  I bought a Joe Cocker and a Frank Sinatra greatest hits CD.  They are good.  At any rate, video games await, so I'll be updating more later.

      I'm feeling wonderful today, and for no apparent reason, to boot.    Going to BOA Friday, and the lock-in thiger is Thursday night.  Looking forward to meeting the 54 people that are going (by comparison, we had like 20 last year) on the oh-so-luxurious and oh-so-new charter buses that the band bought.  w00t.  In other news, a friend of mine has started his own blog thinger, (do I use that word too much?) and everyone needs to go visit him and give his comment box some love.  Stephen's blog is  urlLink here .    And  Real Emotional Girl,  by Randy Newman, is the greatest song evar.  Just so you all know.

      And now I will give in, and post a typical teen-complaining-about-his-parents post.  Forgive me.  I tried, really.  Tonight, I walk out of my room to get a drink.  I happen to notice that my brother is watching something decent, so I walk into the den and sit down.  As soon as I do, he turns it to some show about this guy who is mating a two-headed snake with a one-headed one.  So I say, in not a particularly mean voice, "Can we watch the other show you just had it on?" My mother, having stopped complaining about a missed phone call that was, inexplicably, my fault, proceeds to yell at me for well over ten minutes.  I have yet to determine the reason or point of this.    The yelling centered around my inherent selfishness and hurtful attitude.  She cited the ample time I spend sequestered in my room.  Why don't I spend time with my family, she asks.  Aside from the ironic nature of the situation, what she does not seem to realize is that, due to the nature of my brother, spending time with my family consists of watching two-headed snakes mate on the television.  I have no interest in reaching out to people who consider television family time.    They threaten constantly to take away my computer, on grounds that it gets too much use.  The irony in this, is that for every hour I spend on my computer, my brother spends two in front of the television.  What they refuse to acknowledge is that a rather small portion of the time I spend in my room is spent on the computer.  I spend most of it reading, or playing whatever instrument suits my fancy.  But, again, were I to comply with the collective whim of my parents, it would be to sit on my butt in front of a television, as opposed to a computer.  I have explained this time and time again, but always the threat is to take away my computer, not my brother's television.    And so, there I sit, yelled at for ten minutes, saying all the right things at all the right times, never disagreeing, never displaying any opinion, only utter compliance, because that is what gets her out of my room the fastest.  Nothing I could say would be new as I've explained it all to her before, and so I assume that she is just too blinded by her own bias against me to recognize her own folly.    God, I'm going to bed.

      I am happy because I went to the bookstore, today.  Does that make me a dork?  I bought my second Robert A. Heinlein book,  The Cat Who Walks Through Walls.   The first one was, of course, the perennial life-changing book,  Stranger In A Strange Land,  which I fell in love with.  I also bought  Candide  by Voltaire, because I was in the mood for a French novel.  In other news, I took SAT again on the 6th, and it was only mildly more pleasant than the first time.  For one thing, I wasn't surrounded by Spanish-speaking elephants and mice labeled  grande  and  pequeno .  Also, Amanda was in the same room as me, so we had each other for moral support during the mental lynching.  Yeah.  And I think I may have actually done better, which is contrary to the little packet that said I would go down like eight to ten points in each category.  I guess we'll find out on the eighteenth.  BOA on Friday.  Charter buses.  w00t.  I want City of Heroes so bad it hurts.  I have been reading the forums in my free time.  It sounds like the freaking crap.  And it's only $50 and then $15 per month.  *sigh*  But I paid it for SWG, and that game wasn't half as good as CoH.  And I haven't played CoH, yet.  I figure it's good that I don't have it, or else I would spend all of BOA having withdrawals.    End.

      So I forgot I had a blog, there for a while.  So sue me.  I've started  Picture of Dorian Gray,  and I must say, it has me captivated.  Much goodness between the covers of that book.  Much goodness.  In other news, it's summer, and absolutely nothing is going on.  How about that?  I think I'mma go play one of the stoopid little addicting games I own, maybe SimGolf or SimTheme Park.  I'm such a dork, but I'm waiting for Doom III, and Halo II, and World of Warcraft, just like every other computer gamer in the whole friggin world.  So, SimTheme Park it is.

      Registered for school today. Apparently, someone thought it would be funny to give Jared an earlybird class, then follow it up with late arrival. HAHAHAHAHA. No.     In other news, I made a 4 (out of 5) on the APUSH exam, and band is gonna rock the house this year (because I'm a senior, and I'm the effing coolest).     That is all.    -----     EDIT:  I have been called by my new guidance person, and my classes are officially fixed exactly the way I want them.

      If anyone gets the musical reference in the title of this post, you get a fruit basket.  And Google = cheating.  Speaking of my immense breadth of knowledge in the musical world, Jackie mentioned a line from 'Levon' in the latest post on  urlLink her xanga .  So, of course, being the classic rock God that I am, I took up her challenge, and I typed the entire song from memory.  I know, I amaze even myself.  On another note, my dad called me yesterday and said, "There's this DCI thinger tonight.  Is that something you'd be interested in?"  I think my reply was something akin to a dazed silence followed by, "Yes."  So we went, and I had a great time, as would be expected.  PHANTOM WON, WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!11  There are a lot of great shows this year, and I was especially impressed by the Madison Scouts, who never caught my attention before.  Hope they keep this standard of excellence.  Moving on to something less geeky, I suppose...  My birthday is coming up, (and no, I'm not going to tell you people when it is) and I'm having to make a birthday list for my mom and grandparents.  They're the only people who get me things that I ask for.  Dad always buys something off-the-wall (but that I actually like) and the Aunt normally gets clothes (but she gets good clothes) so everything works out.  I've been trying since I was seven to get them all just to give me cash, and last year they did.  So, maybe this year I can coax them into it again.  I hopehopehope.  Cuz that was a fun shopping spree.  w00t.  I'm done.  --Jared

      So we're driving down the highway today, listening to 102.3, and  Ramble On  starts to play.  I ask my little brother, "Who's singing this?" and he says he'll have to hear the voice.  Robert Plant comes in with that half-scream he has, and my brother, unhesitantly says, "Led Zeppelin."  I think my Dad whispered it to him.  In other news, I went to Trustus last night and saw their running musical,  Bat Boy.   I don't think I stopped laughing from the opening to the end.  (I was going to say the part where everyone dies, but that might have given away the surprise)  It's a musical-farce-comedy-idiocy thing that is perfect in every way, and the talent on that stage is incredible.  I plan to go back and see whatever's playing every effing week.  I really need to study for A+.  I really need to buy the newest Neverwinter Nights expansion.  I really need to study for A+.

      I haven't written anything in weeks.  Not a poem, not even a real blog entry.  And I've not decided if that's good or bad.   I had to listen to an argument over the musical superiority of either the Beatles or the Rolling Stones the other day.  And the funny thing was, they kept waiting for me to say something because I'm so very opinionated, but they don't realize that the Beatles and the Stones are like (to make an entirely unrelated reference to Syd Barrett) apples and oranges to me.  The Beatles constantly strove for musical perfection, finding solace in huge production, and creating a sheet of intoxicatingly nuanceful sound.  The Rolling Stones seemed to have a different (though no less noble) goal of finding perfection in imperfection.  Fans of the Rolling Stones live for a strident moment in Mick Jagger's ostensibly improptu performance, or an ungainly moment in a climactic guitar solo.  I wonder at people who feel that, in order to like the one band, a person must shun the other.  I wonder at people who can't celebrate the fact that real music is an organic experience, changing from one performer to another and from one listener to another.  But mostly I wonder at people.  I apologize for making you read that.  I'm not going to dig too much into this one in writing, but let me just say that it felt a little funny when it was dinner time this past week at camp, and people were pushing me to pray.  It's been years since I've so much as thought about praying, and the idea struck me in a peculiar way, I suppose.  I'm not sure why that's stuck with me like it has.  This is the first year ever I've not been uber-excited about my birthday.  I must be old.   I've been so bored lately.  I practiced my saxophone for three hours today, then I screwed around on guitar, played a few hours of pennywhistle and watched Whose Line.  My entire freaking life revolves around music, and I'm beginning to think I need another hobby.  My suggestion box is open on that one.  I tried knitting, it didn't work out (needles...  ugh).  How about working on my dadgum website?  But that actually makes sense...  I also added about 15 more webcomics to my "check daily" list.  I should post the whole list at some point.  It's rather impressive.  On a big update day, I can spend 45 minutes reading these things.  It's pitiful.  And Megatokyo is NOT one of them.  But that's another story and shall be told another time (or something like that--it's been a while since I've read the Neverending Story).  I have got to be like the king of obscure references.   This is an extremely long update.  I think I'm going to buy that  Strokes  album.  That is, if I can't find  Our Endless Numbered Days .  If anyone has any information that I couldn't learn from listening to the :30 of each song on iTunes, I'd love to know.
