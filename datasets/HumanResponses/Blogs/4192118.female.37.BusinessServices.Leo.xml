						   When I first heard this song, I thought that is my theme song.  Can you love me when I am not who I normally am?  Those days when you are PMSing or just down, will you still love me or do I always have to be the happy one?  Do you love me or the way I am when all is right with the world?  Last year at the John Mayer concert, he talked about this song.  He said most people saw it as lovers and he meant it as friends.  It is about friendship, how you like your friend no matter what the surrounding circumstances.  It is still my theme song.  Suppose I said I am on my best behavior And there are time I lose my worried mind?  Would you want me when I'm not myself? Wait it out while I am someone else?  Suppose I said Colors change for no good reason And words will go From poetry to prose  Woudl you want me when I'm not myself? Wait it out while I am someone else?  And I, in time, will come around I always do for you  Suppose I said You're my saving grace

						   This song always appealed to me as a love song about a relationship that wasn't ever going to last forever, because of circumstances it just won't.  I recently attend a John Mayer concert where he explained that this song was about life.  Look at where you are, this is where you are.  It won't last forever, it just can't, it's not supposed to.  Enjoy life where you are right now because things will always change.  I worry I weigh three times my body I worry I throw my fear around But this morning There's calm I can't explain The rock candy's melted only diamonds now remain  By the time I recognize this moment This moment will be gone But I will bend the light pretending That it somehow lingered on  And I will wait to find If this will last forever And I will wait to find If this will last forever and I will wait to find That it won't and it won't because it won't It just can't (it's not supposed to)  Was there a second of time I looked around? Did I sail through or drop my anchor down? Was anything enough to kiss the ground And say I'm here now? And she is here now  So much wasted in the afternoon So much sacred in the month of June How 'bout you?  And I will wait to find If this will last forever And I will pay no mind When it won't and it won't Because it won't And I will waste no time Worried 'bout no rainy weather And I will waste no time Remaining in our lives together

      It has been three years since all of that mess happened. Where has the time gone. I remember thinking that time had just stopped. It was such a horrible time in my life. I was suspended in time. Horrified about all of the things that I had done. I has shamed my parents, my husband, my family. I was the horrible person and they were all victims. I was come horrible perpetrator that had destroyed everyone's perfect little world, when in reality, it had been destroyed for a long time, it's just that no one was looking.  I was the lucky one who got to say, "Look what a fucked up life we have all been leading." I pointed fingers and blamed all the men in my life. My dad, because he wasn't there for me as a young girl growing up trying to figure out how to love a man. You know the "greatest" thing about that was that he told me, "I knew you shouldn't have married him, but I didn't say anything because it wouldn't have done any good." GREAT! Now you tell me. If you truly felt that way, wouldn't you have fought and refused to pay for anything or something? Wouldn't you have done something, anything, to keep your little girl from ruining her life.  Or better yet, maybe you should have just been there when I was a little girl needing a dad to show her how a man is supposed to love a woman. You couldn't do that, though, because your childhood was such a mess. You didn't know how to love my mother, that's why you two aren't married anymore and you are on your third marriage. That poor woman is struggling to know how to love you because, in reality, you haven't changed, she is just not willing to ever give up.  Then I blamed my granddaddy, who never did anything wrong to me in his life. It was in his death that I felt he had failed me. He died the day before I turned 11 years old. That is the time in my life where I was discovering myself and my sexuality. I needed him there to show me that love that my dad couldn't show me. My granddaddy loved me unconditionally. But he had to die. I couldn't even cry, although I knew I should be, I wanted to, but I didn't know how to.  Then there was the finally blamed. To my husband. He got me all messed up and had me for 20 years and nothing was ever fixed. Was it his place to fix it? Not necessarily, but to a point, I think that he could have made it better, somehow. He actually admitted that one time to me. Wish I had that on recording. He just reinforced what my dad had taught me. That's why I stayed with him, that's why I married him, that's why I was afraid to leave. It was familiar and secure. Not safe, just secure. It was what I knew my whole life.  In the end, I had to realized that I had given up on the marriage some seven years before. I can almost remember the year that I finally said, ok, I am not in love with him anymore, but I am staying because it is the right thing to do. I don't want to have to say I am divorced. That means failure and I hate that I feel that I have failed at most everything in my life. I had kids to focus on and that's what I would do. I was a strong woman. I can do this. I honestly didn't even care if he had an affair, it would take that sexual pressure off of me.  Then there came the days that I just wished that one of us would die that day. I didn't care who it was, but that was the only way out, or so I thought. I saw death as an option. I would not ever hurt myself so that they kids would see me or that anyone would know that I had done that on purpose. I remember one time my mom told me about a woman who had taken a pain pill or something and had some wine and died in her sleep. I was jealous. I tried it. I was on medication, I tried not exactly to overdose, but like an accidental mix of alcohol and meds. It was something to think about, never worked though.

      Here we are, mid-August, 2001. I am miserable. I have a friend who is leaving her husband for a man she met on the internet in a chat room. I don't get the fasination. I have never been in a chat room. I have never instant messaged anyone. I wasn't allowed to download that type of thing because it would mess up the computer. My husband takes the three older children away for the weekend to fish on his new fishing boat. I am left alone with the "baby", all alone. The very first night, as I sit in the house that is quiet, too quiet, for lack of people and the baby is asleep, I go to the computer and download AIM. I want to know what all the fuss is about and I am going to go against the leader of our party and just do it. After I get it downloaded, I watch for anything weird to happen to the computer. I don't want to have to explain anything. I figure I will see it is nothing and just take it off later. I go into a chat room and just start talking and getting talked to. Out of no where, I am getting responses. Sometimes so many I can't talk to them all. These are all guys, young guys, looking for sex. I am just completely enamored. Well, until they start asking me what I look like, how much I weight, am I married, all that stuff. I make up some story about how I want to look and just play along. They won't ever see me anyway. There are guys wanting cybersex. How the hell do you do that? I have no idea. But I find I have an incredible imagination and am a quick learner. I am telling them I am participating, but I am actually not, I am typing too fast, don't they notice that? At one point, I talk to this 17 year old from Massachusetts. Now, at this time I am 34. I say to him, I am old enough to be your mother. He said he doesn't care. I said, no I do and I am not talking to you. I did, however, seem to remember his screen name - GGKP33. At midnight, I fell into bed. I didn't sleep in my bed though, I slept on the couch close to the computer. I never stay up that late and only slept like six hour. I woke up so alive that I just had to get back on line. It was like Heroin, I guess, never done it, but it was like a drug you just can't stop. Around noon that day, GGKP33 instant messaged me again. My heart skipped a beat. I think what I was feeling was a wanting from another male. I tried to justify this by saying I could have control over myself. He was 17 after all and I was sure that wasn't legal to even talk to him like this on line. Long story short, I have an internet affair with this boy for three weeks. It was intense and crazy. We talked on line a lot and on the phone some. We had cybersex and phone sex. The night everyone came home I was the most turned on I had been in years. In fact, I would say I hadn't felt that way since I was a teenager. My husband loved it, but didn't know what to do with me. It was that way the whole three weeks. There were other men I talked to, most older or my age. It was an incredible rush for me. Then he found out and all hell broke loose. This part is too hard to talk about but it was the downfall of our marriage. It was the beginning of the end for us. I had done it. It was all my fault. He hadn't done anything, or so I was supposed to believe. He was the victim, I was the perpetrator. I had ruined anything good that could be salvaged. The journey to the end would last another two years.

      You know, I didn't get into this thing called marriage and have four kids with a man I thought truly loved me, just to get divorced in the end and find out it was not at all what I wanted or thought it was going to be. I am a nice girl, trying to do the right thing. How did I end up a single mother trying to rebuild her self esteem and self worth and find happiness in life? I can tell you this, I am so much better off than I was 11 months ago when I decided to call it quits. Yes, I gave up on the whole idea of my marriage ever being anything worth talking about, in a good way. Many would say, too, that I gave up on God fixing what I saw as unfixable. Whatever about that, I know He knew where I was coming from and I will deal with Him later on that. I am not looking for sympathy, mind you, I am just trying to understand where I went wrong so I don't do that again. Now, don't tell me I didn't do anything, it may have just been him. I don't buy that theory. We all have issues. You do. I do. We ALL do. I know I came into the marriage with baggage from my parents and so did he. Neither one of us had good roll models on how to be happily married. But, we were "Christians" and God brought us together and so he would work everything out, right? WRONG! We had to do something too and neither one of us wanted to put forth the effort at the same time, which just made it incredibly difficult. We went to all kinds of marriage seminars, read books. It seemed that both sets of parents were desperately trying to help up fix what was wrong by sending us places on how to and giving us books. Well, first off, someone actually has to be scared enough to try. Neither of us were. Then to read a book, please! I had three small children to take care of and soon another one on the way. I homeschooled and took care, or was supposed to, of things around the house. There was no way I was going to sit down at nap time and read a "how to fix your marriage" book. I wanted to read about someone else's romance. He wasn't about to crack the cover of anything but something about music, fishing or golf, and that was only a magazine. Why would I do something he wasn't willing to put equal time into. He didn't see anything wrong anyway. Oh, except that his wife wouldn't willingly and wantingly have sex with him. That was his only issue. I had too many to count but was so overwhelmed that I couldn't even think straight enough to get them on paper enough to make sense. So there I was, seven years into a marriage and realized I didn't want to put any more effort into loving this man. It hurt too bad and I was giving up. I would stay married because it was all I knew. I didn't have good job history, I was a stay at home mom. I knew I couldn't support myself and there wouldn't be much child support. I didn't know whatelse to do but make nice and just try to get along. We had good times, don't get me wrong. I was the easy going one. I tried so hard to make light of the tough things that it just wore me completely out. If I wasn't happy, he would get worried and it would just be worse. So I didn't get unhappy around him too much. That was our life until August of 2001.

       Ok, so here I am approaching the one year anniversary of the day I filed for divorce. There seems to be an anniversary for everything, you know. Why not one for the day you decided to be alive and free instead of imprisoned and empty? I think back where I was one year ago and I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. God, how I hated my life then. I was in total despair and hopeless to the point of suicide. Although, at this stage I was assertive, too. I had just completed an IOP, intense outpatient program. I was there because the marriage counselor had seen where I was emotionally and said I should probably check into inpatient treatment for a couple of weeks. To my dismay, I wasn't suicidal ENOUGH! How moronic! I wanted to scream, give me a knife and I will slit my wrists right now, just don't make me go home to him. PLEASE don't make me have to live that life another day. But alas, it was to be that I would come to the hospital every weekday for two weeks, from nine in the morning until noon, sit through three different groups and go home to put into practice what I had learned that day. The first day was not too bad, the first week was just tough. I just sat back and listened to what the other people in the room had going on. I also judged many of them, thinking they were all just pissy wimps trying to get out of work or something. I wanted to scream, COME LIVE MY LIFE! You people don't have any idea what misery is. Yeah, my husband had an affair too, so did I. So what, get over it and get on with it. I had input only when I was asked by the counselor leading the group. I would often look at her and wonder, what is your home life like? How do you deal with your husband and children? One day I was walking down the hall and got pulled into a room. When I saw who had done it, I just hugged her. It was a neighbor. Her son and mine played together a lot. I had known her for a while and she had a clue what I was living, apparently I had shared some stuff with her a couple of summers ago. She was a counselor there and had seen my name in the staff meeting one day. She just looked at me and said how proud she was of me being there and working on myself, bettering me and finding out how strong I can be. I left there so refreshed that day. I think that was the day I decided to make a change in my approach at home. I decided to go home and not be passive or aggressive, but to be assertive. If I took anything from IOP, it was that I had been passive/aggressive way too long. I was going to be assertive. Let me just say, that didn't go over too well. Ok, so I spent two weeks and one extra day in IOP. But when my time was up I was so ready to go home. I remember vividly when my group counselor pulled me aside for my discharge meeting, she asked me what changes I was going to make at home. She asked, too, if I was going to work on my marriage. I looked her straight in the face and said, I am going to be much more assertive and not get pushed around any more and no, most definitely no, I am not going to work on my marriage. I am going to get a divorce. That shocked her. Now, it took me a while to actually get the nerve and money to file, but I did it. I wanted this and I was going for it. Two things, I was on two different medications for depression and I drank a lot. Not a good combination. The medication helped me think clearly, the drinking helped me deal with my husband. It all came crashing down, though, like I knew it would.
