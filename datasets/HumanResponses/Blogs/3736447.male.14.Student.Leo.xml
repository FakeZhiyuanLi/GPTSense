        I'm a little bored right now. I have nothing to do until this evening, I'm going to leave and go to some lake, with my Girlfriend. Normally, I would be a litte excited, but I'm just not in the mood to feel that way.    I'm a weird person.....Or aleast I think. In this one forum called  urlLink Proboards Support , I want everyone to like me. I think I'm noticed by people. I mean I'm in polls and some people say I'm cool. I want to be know as one of the "Legendary" members. That's a lot of work though, I guess if I stick around a couple more years and get good in support something like that might happen......We'll see.   Anyway, For the people who actually read my Blog (Thanks first of). I'm going to try and add in a "Weekly Site Pick". A site that got my interest.   That will be every Monday.    Thanks for reading my Blog....This one was short...But I'm out of Pepsi.
