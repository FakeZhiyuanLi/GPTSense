      I myself have forgotten that I work(ed) in an agency, but I'm so fond of gatherings. Mix Master is well on his way to becoming a full-fledged H.E.A.D. member, the rest of you should aspire to such initiative.   -- On 8/10/04 8:12 PM, "Andrew Ault" wrote:  In case some people have forgotten, we do in fact work at an advertising agency.  And if you've ever seen "Melrose Place" or "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days" then you know that one of the things people in ad agencies do for fun (aside from having affairs, stealing people's jobs, living in the same apartment building) is going out after work with one another and enjoying some cold beverages and the chance to curse and talk about people in the office.  So, with the hopes that we can reclaim our birthright and behave like ad professionals/sailors, I'm proposing a happy hour this friday at everyone's favorite watering hole of ill repute "Grumpy's"  It'll also serve as a chance to help send off a certain person who works here who said he would refuse to come if i mentioned his name in the email.  So tell your friends, dress your best, and go to Grumpy's after work on friday and we'll have lots of fun like the winners in this picture.

      The official H.E.A.D. web log is up and running. Finally, a forum for H.E.A.D. members and disciples to share their thoughts. As if that will amount to a goddamn thing. As per usual, rights are exclusive, so only members may create new postings. The rest of you lushes can only comment. Tough tacos.   urlLink This made me laugh today.  It's funny the first time you try, but that's about it. It's in German, but the basic concept is fairly clear: helping the drunk (wagenschenke?) walk home safely. I can't get past 51 meters.
