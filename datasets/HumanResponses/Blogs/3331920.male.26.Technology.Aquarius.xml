      Hey again,   Tonight was the first night of the last week of me worrying about thankyou cards.  In a feat of motivation unlike me, i confessed to Angel last night that i wanted to have our wedding thank you cards done and sent by the end of this week.  It's not like there's a mountain of them or anything, only 2 dozen.  Sometimes i can be pretty lazy.  And other times i can be insanely lazy.  But this week, damnit, everyone's going to know just how appreciative i can be.  I'm out.

      Just a quick note tonight, i'm going to start pushing the blog in some different directions.  No 'shopping-list' of what happened during the day.  Or at least not as much, anyway.  Stay tuned.  I'm out

       urlLink frou frou makes you happy   I'm just relaxing at home tonight, doing some 3D modelling.  It's going pretty slow, i'm just bashing out a rough-in of a set from the movie Amelie.  Listening to some frou frou mp3's.  I had never heard of this band before i went to see Shrek2.  They do a cover of Holding out for a Hero on that soundtrack.  The lead singer's voice is just awesome.    Ginny, my kitten, is deciding to visit me every once in a while as i work.  I think she's bored and i'm not giving her much in the way of attention.  I also watched  urlLink Monsters Inc.  tonight for probably the tenth time.  This movie is one of their best IMHO.    This is a pretty lax post tonight, cause i'm in a pretty lax mood.  I'm out.

       urlLink Massive Black - About - Manifesto   Yesterday was a blur.  I had a pounding headache after coming home from work, and hit the bed around 6:30, the next thing i knew it was 10, and Angel was coming to bed.  So what the hell, i'm already in bed right?  So i slept right through till this morning when i got up for work.  It felt weird, sleeping for almost 12 hours straight.  I even still had the headache around 5 this morning and had to get up for some Tylenol.    I found an interesting opportunity on the web today, a company called Massive Black.  They are looking to hire contract employees for 3D modelling, texture design, etc.  Ideally, i will start my 'freelance plan' soon, with the ultimate goal being landing a contract with a company like Massive Black.   Without giving up my day job, i would like to expand my skills enough to be able to take on interesting and mind-expanding contracts to get some of that all important 'job-satisfaction'.  But more on this at a later date.  I have some serious planning and content-creation to do first.  I'm out.

      Call it Cape Breton-induced indigestion.  Call it roadtrip recovery.  Whatever you call it my tummy was in a whole heap of hurtin' this morning when i woke up.  I managed to drive my wife to work, and raced back to the apartment for a 'bathroom session'.  I ended up spending most of the morning in bed trying to sleep off whatever the hell bug i had.    I forgot to mention the kickass Trailer Park Boys episode that aired Sunday night.  As simple as their stories usually are, a whole lot happened in those 22 minutes.  That is one farking hilarious show.  I'm recovered enough to head in to work tomorrow morning, and this is going to be one short week.  There's a new project starting up at work.  It should be pretty cool.  Read:  "it will be pretty cool if i get to do some 3D work."  I've been craving some creativity at the workplace for over a month now.  Testing and revision cycles get me down.  I'm usually so bummed out after staring at the computer screen either testing or programming all day, that i don't want to sit down at home and bang out a 3D model.  As Rosemary Clooney would sing...Something's Gotta Give.  I'm out.

      Back in Halifax again.  It was a pretty decent weekend i must say.  Got to visit the folks, they always love having company, especially when it's their kids.    I saw this really crazy converted van that was cut in half and welded shut on the cut end to make a trailer.  Bizarre.  Belted some golf balls around with my dad on Sunday afternoon.  They really do have a big yard.  Went to a bingo game in New Waterford, i'm not that afraid to admit it was a pretty good time.  Drove back today, Monday, and got back just in time to see Shrek2 with some friends.  HILARIOUS...Puss in Boots alone is worth the price of a ticket.  This is one rambling post this time, but i'm trying to rehash 3 days before going to bed..and i'm failing miserably.  So without butchering anymore stories here,  I'm out.

      I won't be visiting the blog this weekend, since i'll be in Cape Breton.  Today is one big blur.  I packed this morning before going to work.  But not before i saw Wilson's Gas Station down on Farnham Gate Road selling gas for 26 CENTS per LITRE!!!  Crazy.  Writing more ASP at work today, i'll be so glad when that's behind me and i won't feel so out of my element.    So now on my lunch break, i have to find some food, pick up an anniversary card for my folks, and a gift if i can.  We'll see how much of that can be accomplished in Bayers Lake in a half hour.  :)  So that being said, i'm sure it'll be a long drive today but we're stopping for Sam's pizza on the way, and we're bringing Ginny, so she's always good for some entertainment.    I'm out.

      Today is going to be a busy day.  Take a full day at work writing ASP, or 'trying' to write it, follow that up with a quick spaghetti supper.  Then take off to the mall or Bayers Lake to buy an anniversary gift for my folks, and maybe a couple of cards.  I also have to squeeze in a haircut, and some laundry to wash some towels.  Now that i write this down, it doesn't sound so bad at all, haha.  i'm out for now.

      Well, it's been a long day coding ASP at work, and i wish i could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but alas i cannot.  It's pretty decent going once i get on a roll, but i'm out of my element when it comes to ASP so it's taking longer than it should.   Ah well, i'll get a break from it this evening since i'm heading out to visit the inlaws tonight.  My wife Angel and I gave out tulip bulbs as favours at our wedding last October, and i hear they're blooming this week.  So we're off to Ellershouse, NS to check them out/visit/have some supper.  I'm looking forward to heading down to CB this weekend.  We're stopping in New Glasgow for some Sam's Pizza.  For those of you who've never tried this pizza, it's the best pizza going!  Angel, i know you're reading this, and yes, i admit Sam's Pizza is the best.  I was writing an evaluation this afternoon for a workterm student we have at the office.  He's a pretty decent guy, in grade 12 and a solid knowledge of 3dsmax.  He's been doing good work, so i gave him the dry, boring evaluation form equivalent of the 'thumbs up'.  As of the end of the work day, that's it for me.  I'm out

       urlLink Honda Civic Nation   Today was all about the Civvie.  I had to take the car in for some maintenance today, and she's back to normal now.  The 'rubber strap' along the front end had been loose on one side, Fixed.  The maintenance light had been on forever, Fixed.  Safety inspection was expired, No more.  Oil in need of a change, Freshened up.    On the work front, the 'video-capture' torch has been passed.  I gave up my firewire card today so that someone else could handle video capture duties while i programmed ASP.  While programming ASP is about as exciting as clipping nails, it has to be done.    I should mention that Blake Sampson, the guy who owns the garage i went to today, gave me a hat for my dad.  Blake and my Dad hit it off pretty well when my Dad worked in the city.  My Dad is the baseball hat king so he'll be thrilled.  For years growing up i think i saw my Dad wearing a ballcap more often than not.  I cooked supper today.  I need to brag about that, but i also need to point out that my wife is definitely 'the cook'.  When i'm feeling particularly confident, or brave, i'll put on the apron and cook something really simple.  Today was one of those days.    For all my preaching about Triplets of Belleville, it went on sale today, and i didn't exactly run to the store to get it.  This week i'll probably pick it up, we'll see what happens.  I'm out.

       urlLink The Incredibles   HO-lee crap.  This movie is going to whoop some ass.  If anyone doesn't know director Brad Bird, you first need to check out The Iron Giant.  Then check out this new trailer for The Incredibles.  Whenever Pixar releases a new movie, you think, 'Wow, there's no WAY they're going to beat that!'.  And then they show you just how wrong you were.  Brad Bird's designs meet Pixar's CG goodness.  I'm getting chills.

       urlLink Trailer Park Boys ~ Season 4   Just finished watching 2 episodes of the Trailer Park Boys tonight on Showcase.  This show is frickin' hilarious!  It's produced right here in Halifax and it definitely takes some getting used to, but after 3 episodes i was hooked.  Beyond that, I was talking to my Mom today and she had gone to a New Waterford wedding shower.  The bride and groom pulled in about 3000 dollars, needless to say it was a big turnout.  Two days away from Triplets of Belleville.  I'm amused at myself for being as pumped up to get a movie that i've never laid eyes on.  With the weekend winding down i'm looking forward to Triplet's on Tuesday, and i'm taking a trip down to Cape Breton this Friday with my wife to visit my folks.  We're also bringing the 'orangutan', our kitten Ginny.  Spring/summer trips to Cape Breton are actually really nice.  The trip along the Bras'dor Lakes has some terrific views and hopefully one of these days we'll actually stop take some pictures instead of driving right by.  There's a good excuse to get a new digital camera.  And on that note,  I'm out.

       urlLink Troy   I just got back from seeing Troy in the Bedford cinemas tonight.  I loved this movie.  If you know the story of the Iliad, you have to see this movie.  If you don't know the story of the Iliad you have to see this movie.  Having recovered from the debacle that was Van Helsing, i was hoping to come out of this film feeling my money was well spent.  It was brilliant.  IMHO, the Iliad is an extremely difficult story to translate into film.  Troy did an admirable job and the casting was spot on.  While not "exactly" lifted from the pages of Homer's poem, it still presents a great story with a believable impression of the time period.  The gods are missing from this telling, but the characters are more than capable of moving the story forward on their own.    The famous Trojan Horse of course makes an appearance, and Troy is made to suffer for stealing away the beautiful Helen.  Although in my mind, Briseis, the girl who falls for Achilles, could have launched 1000 ships as easily as Helen.    A great film, an enjoyable adaptation of the Iliad, a well spent 3 hours.  I'm out.

      Fridays are of course the happiest day of the week.  Although this one was grey and cloudy, it's still a Friday and that's all that matters.  Not everyone was so glad today unfortunately.  At least some people weren't going to let a little thing like Friday get in the way of some serious road rage.    In the parking lot outside the office where i work, i bore witness to some Grade A road rage this afternoon.  I didn't see what caused it, but a car whipped into our parking lot, pulled a U-ey, and got cornered by this rather large delivery truck.  The next second, the delivery truck driver leaps out of the truck, runs over to the car and starts bawling out this guy with a car full of kids.  I'm assuming the guy with the kids must have cut off the truck driver at the intersection up the road, but whatever it was, he was getting a tongue-lashing for it.  Ah well, no punches thrown, and everyone lived happily ever after.  On a completely unrelated note, i've found out that Les Triplettes de Belleville is coming out on DVD next Tuesday and i'm PSYCHED!  I guess all of us 'anglophones' are calling it "Belleville Rendezvous".  For those who don't know, this is an independently produced animated feature out of Quebec.  I missed this one at the theatre, and i've been waiting not-so-patiently for it to come out.  There was a tiny tease of it at the Academy Awards in March when it was nominated for Best Original Song.  The visuals are really striking, and i hope it's critical success signals a shift in the way these films are produced.  But more on this after i've seen it on Tuesday.  I'm out.

       urlLink CBS Homepage   Well, it's official.  Rupert Boneham walked away with the million dollar check on survivor tonight.  No surprise there, it was a popularity contest with the most popular Survivor ever.  Not that he didn't deserve it.  It's good to see the nice guy win the money, since it seems that in the actual game, someone with Rupert's character can never win, because the back-stabbers and cheaters always rise to the top..that's why i love the game so much.  You can have the best laid plan, but it all comes down the the people you're thrown in with.  If you can't adapt and adjust your gameplan, you're gone.  Survivor, we love you.

      The greatest of blogs are nothing without that first post i suppose.  So here's to kicking off what i hope will be a valuable exercise for me.  I admit i'm leaping into this completely unawares, but hopefully i will learn a thing or two about myself and others in the process.    I'm guilty of starting a great many projects that are doomed to linger unfinished or abandoned.  This blog is something i want to stick.  We'll see where it takes me.

The timelines of a woman's life, her film roles, and japanese history are all interwoven in such a powerful way that you will be in awe.  *end trailer-voice*  I love this film, it makes me want to see Kon's other film Perfect Blue.  I'm really on a japanese animation kick these days, and i never really had an interest before.  I credit Miyazaki films for bringing me around.  I'm out.

      Insomnia....sucks.  I'm sitting up, it's midnight. I have work in the morning. Honestly i don't know if i'm going to work tomorrow because i feel like crap. Incredibly drained. The highlights of my day today were taking some pictures, and finding out that my yahoo email account storage has been upped to 100MB. That's pretty sad.  My mind is racing 100 miles an hour tonight, so i couldnt' stay in bed, had to get up. I'm processing an incredibly frustrating work situation, with huge stress about money. It's a wonderful combination whose number one job at the moment is making me lose sleep.  I'm trying to find something good on the 'net right now to save this post from being all 'woe is me', and I have found a decent link:   urlLink The Moving Picture Company   These guys are a film and commercial FX house in Soho, London.  They do work for the Harry Potter films among many others and their flash website is Awesome.  I'm out.

I'm going to assume that Mel and I will be sharing the modelling duties but we'll of course be playing that by ear, since there's still ASP to work on, JOY!  Went for a great walk tonight since it's so nice out. Tried Cous Cous for supper tonight too.  It's pretty damn good. Trying to get a hold of my folks on the phone, but it's busy for the last half hour, so i'm heading to bed. My mom's a bigtime chatter when you get her going on the phone.  I'm out.

      This weekend has been nice and long, helped in no small way by me getting up early (8AM is early for me on the weekend) to go golfing. It's been nice weather all weekend, which has really lifted my spirits. Today i also started up a grid computing client on my computer.  Grid computing is a distributed network that allows multiple people's computers all over the world to work together to solve complex equations or problems. The client software on my PC is helping the University of Oxford with Cancer Research. It's a small contribution to be sure, but it's a nice feeling to be able to offer some assistance.  Two completely unrelated notes:  Angel is now collecting Bellydance instruction/workout videos.  Yum!  And, Michael Turner, my favourite comic artist (which isn't saying much, since i'm not a comics fan or collector) is releasing 2 new series this summer, soulfire and ekos.  You can check them out at his new company website,  urlLink Aspen Comics MLT.   I'm out.

      Me again. Not much new today, i was sitting in on a marketing meeting today and have to come up with a new name for our product at work, as well as a 'positioning statement'. It's really tough to make something that's dry and technical actually sound appealing. I mean the product is really powerful, but the trick is explaining it without sounding like a technical manual. :)  Anywho, Angel's friend Kathy is in town, and the two of them will be hanging out tomorrow night, so i'm going to get the heck out of Dodge for a while i think.  Still haven't decided what i'm going to get up to, but we'll see.   I'm out.

      Today is much better. Golfing is very therapeutic i'm discovering. Sat in a training session today at work, although sadly i wasn't the one being trained so it was kind of long. What made the day though was belting out a bucket of balls after work. I'm loving this new driving range. The bugs were out in full force tonight, which was my good deed for the night i guess, offering up a half teaspoon of blood for mosquito meals. It seems a little crazy to me that it could get so damn hot in one day.  it's been freezing the past while and today was scorching. Not complaining though, you don't have to shovel sunshine.  I'm out.

      Today was a looong day.  Work has been really slow, leaving me with little to do during the day. I shouldn't complain i guess, i'm still getting paid, but man trying to look busy for 8 hours is pretty discouraging. It was also freezing cold and raining all day not much typical June weather these days.  But on a high note, Angel got her hope chest today and all kinds of goodies that came inside it.  It was like Christmas all over again, and more stuff is finding it's way out into the apartment.  It's really looking good. Called my folks tonight, my Dad was working a shift at the Coast Guard College supposedly guarding Kuwaiti dignitaries, but they didn't show, so he too was trying to look busy for 10 hours. Maybe i'll head out and bash some golf balls tomorrow evening if it's not raining after work.  I'm out.

      Step 1.  Head to driving range and belt out 100 golf balls. Step 2.  Wake up next day with really sore golf muscles.   Step 3.  Complain. Step 4.  Do it all again the next week.  Tim showed me this kickass little par 3 golf course that has an awesome driving range and practice green.  100 drives later i'm a little sore, but i drained some 25-30 foot putts on the practice green, so i'm pretty pleased.  Went for a walk today as well with Angel, we're finally getting some sun, so it's a good deal to get out an soak some up. Angel's doing tons of work to the apartment, putting out some of our wedding gifts and the place is really looking up.  I'm out.

       urlLink  SUPER SIZE ME   See this movie!  It is so 'mind-blowing', 'eye-opening', 'motivational', and at times 'disgusting'.  I will admit that i had absolutely no desire to see this movie whatsoever, but i went with Angel, Tim and Jennifer tonight and it was AWESOME!  I'm so glad i've seen it.  It definitely makes me want to cut out fast food, and especially SOFT DRINKS!! Man oh man, to see what that kind of food can do to a person is just crazy. You don't realize the amount of crap you're shovelling into your piehole every day but it boggles the mind.  I think i've been living in denial for too long. Angel is trying to convince me to go to Weight Watcher's with her, and while i'm sure it couldn't hurt, i'm not quite ready to take THAT plunge yet.  :)  But i'm definitely going to curb the pop and junk as much as i can. Now that this is public in my blog, i've got to stick with it right? Right?  I'm out.

      Well after the months (who am i kidding, years) of waiting for the next harry potter movie, tonight is the night.  And while i won't be wearing cloak or taped glasses, i'm pretty pumped.  It's been getting great reviews and all, but even if it wasn't i'm sure i'll love it.  Work was interesting today, got a new monitor and found out we're buying a farking warehouse-load of software on monday. Today was the first sunny day in a while, feels finally like summer's on the way.  Point Pleasant Park opened in Halifax today, and the Prime Minister wannabe Paul Martin was here to kick it off.  He also has stated that he's going to appeal to the immigration minister about that poor woman who has claimed sanctuary in the Halifax church.  I haven't really been following this case, but it's pretty intense, she's lived in there for over a year now, and was recently turned down by immigration Canada. We'll see what Martin can do, seeing as how there's an election and all, i'm sure he's feeling generous.  Enough rambling, bring on Harry Potter!  I'm out.

      I was talking to my friend from school today.  Joel Lelievre.  Joel has a job working for The Orphanage doing 3D work for film. I was wishing him well today, i'm so jealous of the fact that he's doing this great work on cool effects films. He's living in San Francisco now, walking to work along the Bay, and working on Hellboy, Day After Tomorrow, and who knows what else. Ah, the life. :) Back to my life, MUST FINISH THANKYOU cards. They really are the last in the way of 'responsibilities' associated with the wedding, and i'm gonna love putting them behind me.  The feelings of gratitude are important, actually writing out all these cards at one time, is enough of a hell, that Angel and I put it off for 7 months. Whew,   I'm out.

      Argh!  Canadian Idol starts up another new season.  I don't want to devote a whole lot of negative energy to this horrible show, but i will just say this.  American Idol and it's Canadian cousin represent the lowest pandering form of entertainment to me.  Granted there are some talented people on these shows.  But do they really need to strut themselves in front of washed up celebrities, and ignorant 'judges'.  The answer is no.  These shows are one giant mind-f#?k with corporate sponsors.  There, rant done.  On a completely unrelated note, i've been playing the latest EA Potter game, Prisoner of Azkaban.  These games never really offer a whole lot, except to fans of the books.  They're usually good fun though.  This one is no exception, i'm just rolling on it tonight.  Thank you cards are marching along, most are thought up, now i just have to 'neatly' write them and mail them off by the end of the week.  Still on target.  I'm out.

       urlLink Chai! - Recipe   Being a teatotaller, i've been expanding my tea selections for the past little bit.  Moving away from Red Rose, i started with Green tea, and moved on to Assam and Darjeeling, some Indian black teas.  Today Mel, at work, told me about Chai tea.  It's a whole wack of herbs and spices mixed with some Darjeeling, so i'll have to try it out sometime soon.  I'm out.
