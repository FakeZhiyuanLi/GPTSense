      Last night I made a pizza and was going to relax until the show started later. But then deb called me to see if i would hang out with terri at her house while she helped laura move. i guess she thought terri couldn't handle being by herself for an hour. This is something she and i laughed at later. So i took my time to get my own sweet ass over there. I drank deb's beer and terri and i watched episodes of sex and the city. Im totally hooked to that show now.  later deb called and said she needed a ride to the show. we picked her up and headed over to the high noon saloon-which might sound like a countrywestern bar-nope. Its all about the rock baby.  Brickshithouse rocked. Bob III, or something like that came on stage in a motorcycle outfit had a one man band. In his helmet, he stuck a phone which he used as a microphone. During his set, he had two girls bouncing on his knees and later had some girl stick her tits in his two glasses of scotch. it was nice to see somebody mix it up once in awhile. the drunk drivers played next. They reminded me of the pixies at times. the lead singer fell off the stage at one point. i thought the show would be over, but nope after about laying on the floor for about 15 minutes he got up drank another beer and sang 8 more songs all while covered in grime, beer, and blood.

      Looking back, I think I've made a lot of mistakes. Big ones and little ones. I never claimed I was perfect. But even now as i'm realizing current mistakes i've made, some even public to strangers, I know I've learned from them. But I also wonder if I'm ever going to get this right, this whole life thing. It seems like its constant uphill battle and each year I'm just carrying more luggage with me. I just want to drop it all and walk on even  ground for awhile.  I've been thinking a lot about people from my past, what they are doing, how they are doing, etc. As much as I want to know, I know that it is too soon to ask. And then there are some who I could care less if I ever hear their name again. I don't know what kind of person i'm turning into. Its someone different than I thought a year ago. And i don't know if its for the better or worse. I have great friends, different ones than five years ago, but all amazing people that i hope to know for the rest of my life. I have a great job that i love, plus i get my summers off(not really cuz i don't get a paycheck). But its something i can see myself doing for the next couple of years, until i get more organized in my educational plans(grad school, etc).  Maybe i got so messed up because everything was falling into place, and i needed something to keep me on the edge of my seat. Not that i did anything wrong, but i think i allowed myself to enter/create a situation that i really shouldn't waste my energy on. The whole thing still bothers me in someways. I'm angry at how i let them control the situation, or rather how rick controlled the situation. Or maybe it bothers me because i don't really know what happened. Not to say that would help me in anyway.  But.  I don't like to be lied to. I was manipulated in the worst way from him. He was the last person I thought would ever do something like that.  All i know now is that she stayed with him. she's having a baby in a month. and then i think they are getting married or something. which is all fine i mean they can do what ever they want. its all over, the whole drama. But I still hate the way i acted. Not that I would ever apologize because frankly i don't think they deserve it.  I think i acted immaturely. I should have let it go way before i did.   Only in retrospect does that seem clear.

          Last night i went out for nicki's birthday. We met up at Ginza of Tokoyo on the east side. I forgot how expensive it is, I guess i've only eaten there on my birthday so i never had to pay for myself. The food was yummy and it was cool to watch it be cooked right in front of us. The presentation was a lot shorter than i thought it was going to be. Nicki got drunk on sake i think before dinner was over. There was a little drama on how she got to the next bar, but everyone got there safe so it was let go. We went to the wisco next, I only stayed for one beer before deciding to call it a night. But i found out (from heith's mom), that heith is going to propose to amy while they are in california. I'm so excited for them. They are great together. They are two totally seperate people who balance each other almost perfectly. Because of course nothing is perfect.      Today has been nice. I went to the art fair on the square. Met my parents and later alissa and her mom. Bought some yummy red pototoes and fresh mixed greens at the farmers market. Then bought some plants at jungs(2 more ferns!!!). Drove to my parents house and put on my swimming suit to lay out for awhile and swim.  but i don't know....it still seems a little lost for me to completely enjoy today. Maybe if i could just relax a little more or work up a little more self confidence(wait does that have anything to do with it?) or maybe it was just the heat.  i do plan on staying here until monday morning....no more real life for me until next week. That means i still have 2 nights and 1 full day to myself(if i ignore my parents, that is) ;)  a

      This is new and hopefully a little more private than my last one. I don't like drama, but I'm human and I think after awhile I wanted some.  Anyhoo, I want this one to be more for me and less for what other people think. I don't want to hold back for fear of who might read it. I'm trying to keep this pretty anonymous, but who knows....

      sometimes i really hate when people only think of themselves. there is more in this world to think of than yourself.  and sometimes its the only thing that you can think of.  i think about my future. and if it really belongs to me- i'm beginning to think that people are planning and anticipating it for their own futures. I don't even think i can leave anymore. I think i'm stuck here forever. ~~~~~ I'm supposed to pick up someone from the airport tomorrow. I guess I'm jealous of the fact that she got to go on a cool trip. I took care of her plants and picked up her mail while she was gone. She left two messages tonight to tell me to call mel so he and i could decide who could pick her up.  I have a feeling it will be me, not him. Although she has been more in contact with him on this trip than me. I don't want to hear about her trip nor do i want to tell her how shitty of a week i've had.   current music-little star~stina nordenstam
