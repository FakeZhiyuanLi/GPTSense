      I'm happy. I least I know I will always have a good friend to rely on. No matter whatever shit you may get from your family, peers and enemies...There will always be that special someone to get you through the day.  On the professional side, Shell call me up yesterday for a brief teleinterview....guess what? I blew it big time! I was caught of guard..they called me at the unlikeliest hour. I stuttered, that's for sure. Just hope for the best that the inteviewer will overlook that and just see my points.   Okay..things to do today....finish up 132kV feeders on Kasigui. Leave exactly at 6.00 pm to go to the British High Commmision. Haven't been seeing the sexy lawyers for a while.....:-)  I'm walking on air.....and I know it.....

      Have you ever wondered how life can take a twist of its own? I had a shock this morning. A very surprising shock. Not to be disrespectful, I hope that person is happy with the choice he made.   As for me, I need to do a synchro check on what I have been feeling lately. I don't wana lose another friend, not now when I am truly happy. I hope the decision that I'll make will benefit all. Truly.   This weekend I will be at PD for some campus election course. I'm accompanying Zaidah there, as a representative from PJU. Hope my mind would be cleared up by then. My Master's application has been good as well. Completed the form, now just waiting for my certs to be verified by UTP.   I received an ephiphany on the meaning of life.....you just have to move on.

      No, this is not going to be some kind of a movie title. I've been feeling a little bit dowdy lately. Sometimes, when you want to pursue your dreams, but when you look back, you have a baggage to look after. This is what happening to me. I know that I am capable of changing my own future...if the Almighty permits. I am single, earning my own living, a committee member of a cool organization....but I can't take it further..because??   My loyalty to a person who made me what I have become today. Not to show disrespect..but I can't be with her all the time...I have my own life to lead..some dreams to catch and the fact that I can't pursue it because of a person...makes me devastated.   Sorry..been blabbing about here. Just this is what I've been feeling lately......

      I want to announce to the whole world that..I'm freaking happy today! I dunno why..just that the weather seems to be lovely....AND... Ed 's rerun is on Starworld!! Yeayy!  This is the first time I watched the pilot episode. It is really funny. Given a chance..if Ed is real....he is simply to die for! This is the episode where he bought the bowling alley, together with its 3 queer staffs, Kenny, Shirley and Phil.  The scene where he dressed in armour was hillarious, too. I might as well share this with the rest of the Ed-OTT yahoo groups. I'm sure Jeremy and Yasmin would die for this!  Been going to the gym as well. Imagine all the endorphine you produced when you worked out can really make you feel good! Hell, you don't even need anti-depressants!  Next is to fill in my Master's application. People at the Supreme Council is been waiting....seethingly.  So tomorrow is a new me, new life...new story....  As for the rest...they can go and fly kite....

      I got a sample of a script in hand from a producer. She wanted to create a new children series...I haven't got through it yet..but..yeah, it would be interesting. I got Farith to help me with the illustration since he is really good at drawing cartoons.  Ahhh...so many things have happened these past few days. But I got a new comrade. He is a guy from the game shop. Last night,we talked about many things...including his plea for myself not to retire from the shop.  Speaking about the shop, I am missing it!!!! I really do... But I can't really go there without solving an issue I had. Since, this is a public blog..I don't wanna say it here.  But I shall return....and I will survive!!

      Stuck with Farith again for Kasigui. It's kinda good because we really do understand each other now. It's team work, collaboration, understanding..and a dash of sister-brotherly love.  Anyway...I'm okay now. Wouldn't want to think of "that person" much. Now, I wanna concentrate on my Master's application, my job, and Puteri. There world is waiting for me! At least that is the best I can do..and will do.  Just found out from the producer that the dateline for the children story is on the end of August. Dunno whether I can pull that one..but I'll try.  Myself signing goodnight...muahhsss to all.

      So much to do today. Have to finish Kasigui by tomorrow. I've been going home at 12 am for the past three days. Okay, Monday doesn't count because I was at the shop.  I really have to find myself another job. This job is taking my time away from things that matters most to me, my friends, my mom, my clubs....myself!  Probably it will be a better thing just to retire from the shop and dosomething else...I have a script in hand, don't I?

      I have this new idea of a script. Well, after I'm done with  "That Place Called Wolf's"  editing...I'm thinking of writing something out of a combination of my two favourite series.  "Ed and Ally" is going to be a combination of my two favourite sitcoms...Ed and Ally McBeal. It's about Ed, a hot shot corporate lawyer from KL who was fired by his firm. To add more salt tothe injury, he found out that his wife is sleeping with the mailman.  Disgruntled, he opned up his one man legal firm, sharing his space with Ally, who owns her own advertising agency. Ally is a dreamer, an idealist with a view that the world could just be a better place if we just could try.  What I can say, Ed and Ally complements each other. Ed is wacky, humorous and smart...while still nursing his heart from his broken marriage. So when Ed meets Ally, the world just spins....  God...please give me time to write this.  Anything to keep away from that game shop....

      I have a terrible day.I can't sleep last night. I guess, I just slept for an hour or so. Hanging out at Fizan's place last night was a big, big mistake. Wrestling? What was I thinking? I don't even like the game. The reason Iwent is to hang out with the guys and Triona..yeah...!  Give me any social functions, I would love to go..but wrestling???? Can you guys tell me what the fuss with seeing people got smashed up,with soft porn added into in over and over again?
