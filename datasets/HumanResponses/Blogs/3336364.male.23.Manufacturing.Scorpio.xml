      Just a few things that I am going to be doing during my limited 'me' time.  By putting them down here I can make sure I accomplish them.   Nexus Goals   First and foremost I need to catch up on Hunty's paperwork.  Between the Chongun Community Events (CCE) and War College I have lots I have not done in the last few weeks.  I have to get that done.  Give away the CCE.  But not back to Jaded.  Anyone but.  Give away my baby.  The Chongun War College.  As much as I hate to, I have to.  I just can't do it anymore.  Hopefully I can still teach a class every now and again.  I would like to start up a new group of Chonguns.  Made up of only the best and brightest hardcore roleplayers, this group would be different from the pussy-ville the current Chongunate and Sodo has become.  We would take sides, we would fight for what we felt was right, we would once again truly defend the kingdoms.  Not this open ended 'anyone who needs it' bullshit which amounts to no action taken at all.  We would again become the holy defenders of the kingdoms we once were.  I hope to start a new blog about that soon.  Stay tuned, I'll post it here when I get it set up.  Last Nexus goal, step down from guideship.  I don't have the time, nor do I have the patience to deal with Masra.  I do plan on staying a Chongun.  That'll never change.   Magic Goals   I swore up and down that I wouldn't buy any more Magic cards.  But alas I have been sucked into the greatness of 5th Dawn.  I have already put together a list for a Surprise deck for me; Black and White with only 8 creatures.  But I should be able to get many many more than that. Bwahahaha!  So I would either like to buy some packs or just buy the cards for that deck.  We'll see, 5th Dawn isn't out for another week anyway.   Video Game Goals   Buy some! Hahah!  I would like to get my PS2 online with FFXI, so I can play without having to be at my computer.  How I would love to use the controller and lay in bed. It'll allow me to play it more too.  I suppose I should get my Xbox online too.  But that'll have to wait til I get some of my more important things done and payed for.   Work Goals   First off, I need to start staying with Gerhard during the week to shorten my drive.  I was going to do that this week but I'll start next week.  There are way too many things to list here in detail so I'll just run through a few so I can at least have them down.  Fix the 1st to 2nd shift information exchange.  Create a working 2nd to 1st shift information exchange.  Eliminate completely the computer based router system.  General process fixes.   Life Goals   Pay my Credit card off.  Hopefully this week.  Pay my Car insuruance in full.  Hopefully in the next two weeks.  With those two things done I can start putting more money into my car payement.  I would like to have it payed off by November.  So I can have extra cash to be able to buy everyone nice Christmas goodies.  I like doing that.  Finish valuefocusedmanagement.com and if I ever find the time, put together my own personal site.  See Kelzor more.  Once a month isn't good enough for me.  I need her, I crave her, I miss her.  All the time.

      Eep!  I know I haven't posted in a few days, but alas I cannot make a true post at the moment.  Today has been a busy day at work and I am going to go shut down the shop so I can get the hell outta here.  I'm crazy tired and sore, but I'll explain about that later.  Maybe this evening, maybe tomorrow.  We shall see.

      Well I am still sitting here at work.  I am not happy about it.  But at the same time I am.  But staying late tonight, I will be allowed to sneak off early tomorrow.  Hopefully I can sneak off at 8:00 pm tomorrow and be in Boston by midnight.  But with the way things are going lately at work, who knows?  I'm sitting talking with one of the Plasma guys, when I see one of the first shifters stumble in.  And I do mean stumble.  I get up and walk towards him.  About eight feet away I can smell the booze on him, no lie.  Anyway he proceeds to tell me how he just came to go to the bathroom and he wondered if he should take his tools home.  I asked, "Take your tools home?"  Steve Martin (His real name, maybe being wasted was joke? >.  I mean WHAT THE FUCK!?!  Throw your tools out?  Are you retarded?  Oh yeah, you are.  You came to work wasted.  What would possess someone to come to work hammered.  And this dude was haaaaammered.  He could barely stand up.  I kinda spazzed cause I didn't want him to have an accident here and told him to pee and leave.  I should have sat him down, called a union rep and the operations manager.  Hind sight is twenty-twenty.  Anyway, he'll have hell to pay come tomorrow.  On a lighter note, I was going to complain about FFXII but I totally changed my mind.  For a few reasons.  First, I saw this  urlLink screen  and absolutely fell in love.     Not only are the cut scenes nasty, but that massive army and the general or whatever is just plain awesome.  He reminds me of a young Hunt (my Nexus Chongun - want to know more, ask me).  All shiny and paladin-like, motivated and powerful.  His heart is pure, his desire to do good is unerring.  He commands the respect of all the nations in the world, he can accomplish anything he dreams of.  But there is always that one person who hates him for what he is, for being everything that 'one person' is not.  But in the end sacrifices must be made..  Whew, I digress.    The real kicker about me liking this game is the fact I was being a hypocrite.  I didn't want to like it because of the change in the battle system.  But I am always the first to say what keeps the Final Fantasy series so fresh and good are the great stories and constant innovation.  So, I guess I am already in love with this game.  I just pray, pray, pray it has a great plot.  I NEED another Final Fantasy VI.  Boy am I a geek.  P.S.  urlLink Ashe  is hot!

      Disclaimer:  If you are easily grossed out, read no further.  Mmmmbbt.  Mmmmbbt.  I slowly peeled one eye open to spy my insanely loud alarm clock.  6:45 am.  Even though my brain wasn't awake, my body was.  I had a choice and it was a doozy.  Sleep another 15 minutes or get up and take a massive dump.  I quickly choose sleep over bowel evacuation and slammed the sleep bar.  16 minutes later I was up and in the shower, having completely forgotten about my previous dilemma.   8:00 am.  After a nice couple egg sandwiches I am off down the road to work.  We were having a stupid all employee meeting with some equally stupid customer so I had to be at work at 9:30 am instead of 2:00 pm.  Gurgle.  Gurgle, Gurgle.  Well I wasn't two miles down the before my stomach started hating me. So the entire ride I let out little squeakers to keep the pressure in my gut to a minimum.  I figured that after the meeting I would take care of things.  So the meeting wraps up around 11:00 am when I realize there is no possible way I am taking a dump then!  Not only was one of the first shift Stuporvisors not here, meaning I got stuck doing all his work, including a weeks worth of payroll in about 10 minutes, but every single worker possible was in the shop.  The bathroom traffic was way too high to pull off a maneuver like I was planning.  At figured I would simply wait until first shift was out at 2:30 pm and two thirds of the bathroom patrons would be visiting their own personal thrones.  To make matters worse Gerhard and I got more gas station Mac-n-cheese for lunch.  So 2:30 rolls around and I end up getting extremely busy.  But instead of my problem slipping my mind, I can't get my mind off of it.  It seriously felt like there was a watermelon in my colon.  But I had too much stuff to do before part of my shift left for the day at 6:00 pm.    Finally 6:00 rolls around, we are down to four people in the shop!  I can unload this nuclear missile!  I turn the corner start walking to the bathroom and who is coming the other way?  None other than the Vacuum Vaquero.  But now he is wielding a mop to clean the bathroom.  No fucking way I am doing that now.  But on the upside by waiting I am guaranteed a clean bathroom.  6:30 pm. I'll spare you the gory details but in summary, it was awesome.  One of the best dumps ever.  Standing up I figured the Cosbys are dropped off, swimming happily and all is well.  I flush our industrial vacuum toilet and of course it plugs.  This was a monster.  Well I grabbed the plunger and was about to finish the job when I paused.  I actually said out loud, "No fucking way."  There was Bill Cosby staring at me from in the bowl.  Not only that, there was Mortimer Icabod Marker.  I stood stunned before jamming the plunger down on Bill as Mortimer screamed out, "Do, do, Do, do, Do, do!"  (By the way, I think I may be slightly delirious from lack of sleep and being at work for a million hours.)

      Apparently I am unknowingly a master of persuasion.  After a few attempts to get the great Kelzor (my loving girlfriend) to simply comment on my Blog posts the unthinkable happens!  She went out and actually created her very own blog.  And where I am just plain strange and sometimes end up being funny because of it, she is weird and funny, always at the same time (which is a good thing).  So it is definitely worth it to check out her  urlLink daily antics .  Maybe I can use my new found powers to get Kelly to join me at the 5th Dawn Pre-release this weekend.  I'll be traveling to Boston to see her and  urlLink Your Move Games , located in Boston, is hosting a pre-release event.  Coincidence?  I think not.  If by some strange occurance my powers will no longer work on her, I'll have to go a different route and cast Persuasion on her.       If by some reason it actually goes through and isn't countered, I'll have to give one hell of a crash course on  urlLink Magic  in general, Deckbuilding strageties and Sealed deck strategery.  I would be in heaven not only teaching  urlLink Magic , but with 5th Dawn in general.  For those in the know; I have always wanted to run a Black/Green/Rainbow with the ability to drop 5 color nasties.  And before where I thought the Mirroden block was pretty gay, I now realize it was created for me and only me.  Anyways if you have read this post this far you are either drooling over 5th Dawn or wondering when I am going to shut up about  urlLink Magic .  Well I will be shutting up now, not because I want to but because I have to get back to work.  Anyway.  More to come later, I have been holding back ranting about FFXII but I don't know how much longer I can hold up.  Stay tuned.

      As you probably already figured out, I achieved my goal of being wasted.  And although I already knew I had a massive cranium, apparently it gets heavier the more I drink.  Beyond that, I think this clip speaks for itself.    urlLink

      My buddy Steven Tyler called up and told me that Gabe and I had to take over for him on his current tour.  I was a little worried because we needed to brush up on our vocal skills.  But with a little practice my howl far surpassed the quality of Steven's.    urlLink

      So I'm sitting here thinking about what I am going to do for lunch, when Gerhard comes in and says, "Lets go get some good Mac-n-cheese."  So we run out, hop in my car and he directs me to a gas station.  I'm thinking, 'You have to be kidding me, a fucking gas station!'  And not just any gas station, the dirtiest run down gas station in the world.  There was a 350 pound man in there who looked like he hadn't showered in about 4 weeks, smelled like it too for that matter.  He was interested in Fried fish and Lotto tickets.  I secretly wondered if something similar to his armpit goo was going to be used for cheese in my lunch.  We grabbed some sodas, waited in line, then grabbed our Mac-n-yack.  Gerhard dug into his before I had even finished paying.  I sat down in the car, cracked open the box and had some good fucking Mac-n-cheese.  Like leaving work early good (which I'm doing today ^^).  I was uber shocked.  Well we pull back into the AAR parking lot and here comes Monica, the soft-spoken little engineer.  On a fucking motorcycle.  Come to find out, everyone, hourly and salary drives fucking bikes.  And listens to Death Metal.  It makes it even more difficult to figure out who is going to come in and start shooting up the place.

      I am quite bored here at work and the spanish dude is in my office vacuuming.  It is really quite annoying.  Besides the Vacuum Vaquero there are only three other guys in the whole damn place.  I am so bored that all I can think about is how wasted I am going to be on Friday.  I am going to be getting out of work at about 5:00 Friday, home as 7:30, shitfaced at 9:00.  As long as things go according to plan.  We shall see.  Call if you are interested in joining the fun.  Anyway, back to work.

      Have you ever had one of those days when all you hear on the radio are awesome songs.  I mean, no crap at all! A crappy song starts, you switch the channel and BOOM you are right at the begining of another awesome song.  That happened to me today.  I believe I started out my ride to work with a little...   Jethro Tull, Bungle in the Jungle    Let's bungle in the jungle --- well, that's all right by me. I'm a tiger when I want love,  but I'm a snake if we disagree.   Then we had some..   Led Zepplin, Battle of Evermore    The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath,  The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on.   Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before.  No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold.   Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.  The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back. Bring it back.   At last the sun is shining, The clouds of blue roll by,  With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes.     Queen, Killer Queen    She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine Dynamite with a lazer beam Guaranteed to blow your mind Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite wanna try?    Aerosmith, Rag Doll    Rag doll livin' in a movie  Hot tramp daddy's little cutie  You're so fine they'll never see ya  Leavin' by the back door man  Hot time get it while it's easy  I don't mind a come on up and see me  Rag doll baby won'tcha do me  Like you done before    And finally finishing up with my favorite yet..   George Thorogood and the Destoyers, I Drink Alone    'Cause I drink alone, yeah with nobody else...  Yeah, the other night I lay sleepin' And I woke from a terrible dream So I called up my pal Jack Daniels And his partner Jimmy Beam  And we drank alone, yeah with nobody else   I know, I posted a lot of lyrics.  Deal with it.  At least it is a post.    P.S. I can't wait to see my lovely girlfriend this weekend.   P.P.S. GT & JT are her favorite bands too.

      Lots o'things to update today.  As for yesterdays goals, all three were accomplished with religious like zeal (especially the chinese part).  I definitely like Golgan better, even though Gage could do more damage Golgan is just a beast.  I now have Monk up to level 4 and Thief up to 6.   As for my previous goals:    I am caught up in Nexus, now I just have to find suitable replacements.  I will probably try to see if Raquil will take War College and hell, Jaded could have CCE for all I care now.  My Magic goals.. well I don't ever think those will happen.  I just don't have the time, money or people to play with anymore.  So those are getting the axe.  I bought some Video games (La Pucelle Tactics ^^) and got my PS2 online.  So I'm well on the way to completing those.  Work, is well work.  I'll probably be going through some changes soon anyway, seeing how I am "one of the corner stones of the organization".  Probably going to do a split shift and have my title changed to process engineer.  Haha.  I can't help but laugh, imagine how awesome I would be had I went to school?  You bitches wouldn't stand a chance, I would take all your jobs!   (Note: This comes from the fact that four or so people are being fired and a couple of us are assuming all their responsibilities.)   As for my life goals, I accomplished the most important one, seeing  urlLink Kel-zor  more.  Credit card is paid off.  Now I just have to focus on the other shit.  More to come tomorrow. ^^

      Here I am sitting at work on a Saturday and things are finally starting to slow down.  Well they are still chaotic but at least it is manageable now.  Well I took a few moments to myself and I realized that I have been a poor blogger lately.  I always have things I want to talk about but I just don't find the time.  So from this day forward I'll be a better blogger.    Anyway, I'll be leaving in a few hours and I plan on doing two things.  One, Play lots and lots of Final Fantasy XI.  I started a Galka named Golgan who is a monk.  I like monk but I don't know which I like better, Gage the Taru Black Mage or Golgan.  We'll see.  Two, Sleep.  I have to work again tomorrow which sucks but at least I don't have to stay till 2:30 AM like I did last night.  Three (I know I said two but I just thought of this), Eat.  Chinese food or something fried and cheesy.  Oop! Blades are coming out of the oven now, time to go unmask the roots.  (I love when no one knows what I am talking about, makes me feel smarter and more important than all you fools.  Mwahahaha, Bitches).

      This was sent to me today by the wise  urlLink Kel-Bot .  Don't ever tell Scorpios they've had enough, for they'll smirk at you and quietly but intentionally keep tippling till they're hog whimpering drunk, out of 100-proof spite. Scorpios like to drink, and screw you if you have a problem with that. Most of them see the sauce as something to savor in itself, and not as a personality-altering tool -- though if depressed, self-loathing Scorps seek total obliteration. But generally, they're fascinating drinking pals, brilliant conversationalists and dizzying flirts. They also remember everything -- especially what you did when you were blitzed. Only drink with a Scorpio who likes you.  Sounds a little like me eh?  "Hey Gabe!  Jump into that bush!"
