      My $3000 organic, chemical free bed came today.  Half of it is sitting in the downstairs hall.  The box spring was too big to fit up the stairs.  I wasn't at home when it came, my assistant was assisting and called with the news.  When I made a quick call to my contractor, he assured me that I wasn't the first person who this had happened to (am I to feel better?) and that most people send it back and get a king, with two box springs instead of one (not really an option for me considering the size of my bedroom).  So I arrived back from a particularly difficult client meeting, realizing on the trip home that I forgot to go to a see a second client, to see half my bed in the downstairs hallway.  My head has developed a pattern of feeling extreme pain along the left hand side, sort of like there is a ridge where two piece of the skull meet and it is being pried open.  The handyman's job was to bring the rest of the stuff from the apartment over to the house.  My mom rented a truck to do it and drove over with the guys.  Moises and a posse arrived about three hours late, but arrived, and arriving is huge in the world of finding handymen.  They, after much failed effort of the mattress delivery people, tried to get my bed up the stairs and also failed.  Moises has decided that he can cut through the ceiling in the stairs to get it up.  That would be the linen closet, which would have to be rebuilt.    Personally, I think it will be best to blast through the really incredibly crappy windows in my assistant's office and bring it in through there.  She needs new windows anyway.  A friend emailed me that what others do is to cut the frame in half, fold it up like a taco and then unfold it upstairs.    I just can't imagine cutting through the frame of a brand new $3000 bed!  I feel that would pretty much do me in.I could see how the taco would it would work.  She also mentioned that she had to get rid of other furniture she couldn't fit up the stairs.  This does not bode well for my future.  I read somewhere that you need to measure the doorways of your home before going to a flea market.  My thought is to open up some of the entryways to the house, like those blasted windows, and bring the stuff in that way.

      I suppose it is most natural for the cockroach to climb into view right when you begin to cook dinner.  And that is what happened to me.  A rather horrendously large affair for one who has never had roaches.  It was trying to climb out of the sink and every time it made a bit of progress, it slid back down.  Unable to fathom coming close enough to a bug to kill it, I did what every rational single woman does.  I called my mother.  The first thing she thought of was getting the old owners to pay for the exterminator.  All I wanted to know was how to get rid of it.  She had no immediate advice, save calling an exterminator.  Despite wanting to keep the house chemical free, I really wanted to get one to bomb the place pronto.  A few days ago, I bought this book on housekeeping.  Pathetic though it may seem, I really can admidt that I don't know how to keep a house.  Probably I don't even hand wash dishes properly.  So I bought the book and it is sort of freaky in its oddly comprehensive coverage of living in a home.  It covered everything from how linen is woven to the need for business insurance for a home based business.  I couldn't find roaches, under r, I looked twice, in the glossery.  Mind boggling.  Certainly people get roaches, don't they, certainly more people than have the need for knowing the invasion of privacy tort law, which is, in fact listed.  I resorted to boiling water for this little piece of crap.  A big pot of boiling water, poured over it three times, killed it.  Of course, then it was just sitting in the sink and I discovered that dead cockroaches are just as disgusting a thought as live ones.  Wrapping it up in a paper towel was out of the question.  Can't get that close.  All I could feel was the sensation of bugs all over my head, arms, back.  I just kept on feeling bugs on me.  I stared at him.  Finally, it occured to me that there are countries where people probably eat them.  I braved my squemishness and grabbed my kitchen tongs and used them to pick him up, dump him in the garbage and take the garbage out.  The book is super fastidious about cleanliness and it is easy to see why, but I don't even want to clean where this has been.  I could barely touch the garbage bag.  I boiled my tongs for 10 minutes and threw them in the sink to soak.  I should finish the dishes but I really just feel like letting them sit in the sudsy water overnight and not touching anything down there again for a while.  The internet gave me a few answers.  One was borax.  I had nearly forgotten and thought it best for ants, but a mixture of borax and sugar (OK, also TSP and flour but I don't have TSP) would kill the vermin.  I pour a heap down the drain and then in the area under the sink where I think I jostled it free in the first place (I had just taken all the cleaning products out of their moving box and put them away under the sink when he arrived -- yes, it was a he, I am sure).  I poured some behind the stove for good measure and then left the rest of it sitting out on the counter, just in case.  Evidently, the sugar attracts them, they crawl through the mixture and when they lick their gross little bug legs, they die.  Then, thank the lord for cannibalism, they are evidently then eaten by their friends and family, who also die.  I am supposed to put it down again in 4 more days and then 2 weeks.  I think I may make up little jars like I did for the ants and just bomb the whole house with this borax mixture.  So, do I call the exterminator or do I wait for the natural stuff to come.  My organic, chemical free bed comes tomorrow.  So, I really would like to avoid the former.  What, after all, is the use of the chemical free bed if the exterminator comes the very day it enters the home.  That would be a bit much for me to take.  Then again, if I have to choke down another meal, watching every bite as I am certain a roach got in the bowl and is making its way to my fork, I will loose a little too much weight a little to quickly.

      During the past few weeks, I bought and moved into my first house.  It was the typical nightmare, as it is for everyone, though while I was in the throes of it, it did quite seem that no one could have had a move as difficult as mine.  So difficult it was, I ended up hiring someone to put my stuff away for me.  Maybe I needed that because I also had work at home and so the upheaval was double.  Maybe I am just secretly lazy.  The house is a two story bungalow with a full basement and an oversize yard.  It is huge and will be even bigger when I get over my fear of the basement and incorporate that into my the house's liveable space.  It seems as though, in time, there will be space to have a place for everything.  One of the most difficult experiences has been the search for the handyman.  It is simply amazing to me that, considering the number of single women there are who own their own homes, that no one has made a business out of being a handyman.  You could charge some serious money to fix gaskets on toilets, change locks, muck out a basement.  Certainly I, at least, can only take so much of that kind of work before I destroy something or otherwise want to just destroy something.  The list for my handyman grows each time I walk through the house.  I should probably be writing it down.  Light fixtures hang from the ceiling with exposed wires.  Exterior doors don't actually shut or don't actually lock.  Toilet gaskets need fixing.  Yesterday, as I lay on the air mattress that currently serves as my bed until my new one arrives, a crash downstairs heralded in the day with the caving in of the first floor bathroom ceiling.  That should probably be fixed.  Moises comes tomorrow.  I met his brother, Gregory, when he was picking through the heap of garbage the old owners left in the alley.  Unforunately for him, he grabbed a few bottles of liquor which I happen to know are undrinkably old.  Fortunately for me, he spoke enough English to talk to me and my dad about hauling out all the disgusting and tacky detrious left by the old owners.  Tables, bureaus, chairs, crock pots still sitting in their boxes.  They hauled it all out one Sunday morning and I then had the chance to talk to them about coming back.  Frankly, I was a nervous wreck about their leaving it had been so difficult to find someone.  Gregory had a job so aside from his portion of the easy $300 they earned from me for two hours of work, he didn't need me any more.  Thankfully, Moises isn't so fortunate.  Hopefully he isn't unemployed because he is a hack or worse.  I guess time will tell.
