        since in my profile... you can hardly read all i had to say... i am putting it here-----     I am just a girl who loves stars, her family, and life itself. I love to play and have fun and laugh, but I love to cry and feel emotions and feel love and the healing comfort of the ones that I love... I am an artist, musician, daughter, sister, granddaughter, wife, and mother to 2 furbabies... and hopefully a mother someday to human babies [non-furry]...I am a Hoosier by birth, Boilermaker by choice. I am a mountain dweller but live in the foothills, and a country girl at heart...I can leave the city anyday but the country life --- never. I love the water, but the ocean scares me --- I'll still swim in it though and think that it's absolutely beautiful. I despise spiders with everything I am and freeze in fear when I see one. Can't kill em though -- that's the husbands job. I love rain, thunderstorms and lightning, crisp fall days where you can feel the coolness of the air and hear the leaves rustling above you...but I adore spring days where all the flowers are in bloom and hot summer days spent at the lake floating on a raft and letting all my cares and worries sink down to the bottom of the lake and my day dreams take over my head and float up into the endless puffy clouds above. I love the sound of my family all around me... their hugs and love. I love the smell and feel of my freshly shaved Ant's face... and how my body just smooshes into his just right so that he's like my big body pillow that wraps all around me and protects me. I love the way my Brecken is such a girly dog and will do anything for a touch or glance or attention of any sort from us...and how our Denver is so not a cat and will curl up in the sink to cool off and smack me in the face to wake me up...I love how whenever I need a good laugh, my sister is who I can always go to and make me cry I laugh so hard and I love how each one of my family can make me cry so hard when I have to say goodbye to them because I know how much love there is there if it hurts so bad to leave and am thankful for that. But that's just a bit about me....

       This is my first post for my  :blog:  ... not really sure how this thing works or what I'm supposed to write in here, but I think it may be sort of like a journal..... so that's how I'm going to treat it. I'll write more next time, but this first one is just sort of a tester....  lata
