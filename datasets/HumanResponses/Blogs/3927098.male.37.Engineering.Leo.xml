      I was pretty tired yesterday so I decided to listen to my body and take an extra rest day.  This morning I feel so much better.  Missed a short swim and 1.5 hr bike but will only make up the swim, probably at lunch today, I actually remembered to bring my swim bag this morning.

      14 miles 2:18:19, not too hot, fairly pleasant run.  Justin brought me water at 9 miles, I saw Norm and Diane on their bikes, saw Roman on his way home from work and then on his bike.  80 degrees and sunny was nice weather to run in.  Knees felt OK, legs a little tired at end, 4 gels taken at miles 3,6,9,12.

      Yesterday was a nice day off, I didn't get the 5000 calories like I said, maybe 3000. 

Today's swim was harder than it looked on paper. It took me about an hour and a half for 3600 yds, some pulls, catch-ups, kicks and sprints along with some breast strokes. Broke my strap on my goggles, luckily I had my spares with me. Forgot to bring the Gatorade with me again. Form seems to be comming back, I worked on sweeping my catch during warm-up. Right hand is good, left hand needs some work. I will work on it on drill day.

      AAAhhhhhh, I am so beat from the weekend.  Dozed off at 9pm last night and slept straight through to my alarm this moning (530am).  I need this rest day, after work I'm going to eat 5000 calories and go to sleep at 7pm.  Oh yes, my dad's computer has some serious issues, 550 pieces of spyware and 15 viruses, I think I've got them all cleaned up, we will see tonight.

      It starts on friday with 4 miles of running speed work.  1 mile warm up, 1 mile cool down and 8X400m supposed to be on 2:00 and 1:50 but I ran too fast and wound up with a bunch of 1:50s and 1:45s.  Hard workout but it was over quick.

Saturday starts with a medium distance swim at Spring Mill Pond with Norm and Rhonda.  5 laps, 1.5 miles, then 102 miles on the bike in about 5:40:00 and followed by a 2 mile run.  Ronda kept me company on the ride, it was a long day.  That was my first 100-miler and I wanted to know what it felt like to run afterwards.  I really felt pretty good, surprising!!!  

Sunday I rode with Downriver Cycling Club, 34 easy miles followed by a 4 mile run.  Kind of tired on the run so it was cut short from 5 miles.  Went to dinner at dad's house afterwards and worked on his computer.

      22 miles on the bike in 90 degree weather, it doesn't get much better than this.  The warm sun on my skin makes me feel great.  Put on lots of sunscreen and drank lots of fluids, 54oz of water and accelerade.  Missed the swim today cuz I ran out of time.  I think I will swim tomorrow at lunch, it's only a half an hour, then speed work on the track.  Weather channel says a high of 73 tomorrow, a drastic change from yesterday and today.

      2 hr run, 12 miles.  Really hot!!!  Almost 90 degrees.  Started out easy and HR went up to mid 150's early so I went with it keeping the same PE.  Kept the HR there and the pace started to slow so I picked up the pace to average 10 min/mile for the whole run.  Average HR was 156 bpm, not as high as I expected.  Got home and didn't have time to cook dinner to I went to Taco Bell.  

Next weeks run will be 2:15:00 and I will run to HR instead of pace or PE, well, maybe PE.  It should be 13.5 to 14 miles.  I might ride with Roman tonight, don't know how his pacing is but I think it will be fast.  Forgot my swim bag this morning so I'll go home to get it at lunch time, just a .5 hr swim today.

Oh, I allmost forgot, my knees are feeling much better.  I didn't have the pain on the outside of my right knee like I normally do at the end of my long run plus my left knee is not sore like normal.  I read that during the footstrike that you should land on the outside mid-foot then roll to your ball of your foot then to the toes.  I worked on that instead of just landing mid-foot and it works much better.  The ice is helping too.

      Another long swim day.  3200 yds, 1:14:00, kind of tiring, I went pretty hard and I'm still looking for the form I had a month ago.  This pool at Bally's is slow, at least the water was a bit cooler today, I'm guessing 80 deg.  Still warm but better than 84.  Even though I am tired I have a sense of accomplishment after this swim, my left shoulder doesn't hurt and I swam hard to the end.

Got to get lot's of rest cuz tomorrow is a long run day.

Oh yes, Lance took the yellow jersey today. 8-}

      Today is supposed to be a day off but I just couldn't sit around and do nothing so I went to the pool to do some easy drills.

Got there, got dressed and found that I forgot that my goggles were in my race bag from yesterday.  A nice guy (Ralph) loaned me his goggles so I could swim.  I didn't even know this guy and he offered to help.  What a nice world this can be.  I'll give them back tomorrow when I do my long swim.

Just swam 20 minutes of easy drills.  Worked on left side breathing too.

      Forgot to log yesterday's ride in. 2 hrs, 39 miles. Road on Diane's Spinergys, they were kind of spongy sprinting up 5 mile hill and the wind blew me around a bit, but overall they were nice riding wheels.

Race day today, Clark Lake Triathlon.  Got there early, got a good transition spot, had a decent swim, good bike and good run (for me).  800meter swim, 14mile bike, 4 mile run, 1:29:50.  Not too bad, ran well off the bike and started to feel really good at the 2 mile mark.  The running is getting better, knee doesn't feel sore at all. I was going to ride the spinergys today but decided to ride my normal race wheels cuz I thought it was going to be hillier. 

Tomorrow is a rest day, I will probably do some really easy drills in the pool and then up to 13 hrs for the week.  3 hard weeks in front of me before another break and race.  I have to make sure my knee gets stronger.

      I moved my Bike Time Trial test to friday cuz I am supposed to have dinner with my dad tomorrow and the park is close to his house.  Instead of the bike ride today I swam.  2750 yds, kind of short but fun.  I picked up the workout from my club website.  Pool was too warm again but that's normal.  1:07:00 in the pool.

Decided to race this sunday, I'll sign up tomorrow.  I hope there is still room.

      Good solid run, got rained on twice, once going east and then going west.  The rain really cooled me off and kept my HR down.  Saw a lot of bikers getting soaked too.  Feet got wet in the last 3 miles and made squishy sounds the rest of the way home.

      My first day with the blog and I have so much to write but I'm not cuz it would take a month to complete, so here is a short version.
To date this is what I have done.
Last year, my first, 3 sprint tri's, 1 oly.

This year, my sophomore season, train, train, train, 1 oly (Seahorse), 1 Half IM (Eagleman), 1 race slightly shorter than an oly (Big Fish)

I have taken over my own training schedule about 4 weeks ago and have learned so much about scheduling in that time that I have become more serious about what I do.  This is an easy week so there will be no exciting news, that will come in the next couple of months.

Today is my long run for the week, 1 1/2 hrs, should be 9 to 10 miles.

      Took it easy in the pool, just 2100 yds in about an hour.  Still feeling sluggish from the weekend.  Next week I think I am going straight distance for the allotted time to work on pacing.  Pool swimming seems to be slow right now, I'll just go with it and pick up the distance a little while sticking to the plan.

      Good race day, got close to most of my goals and the overall time is where I wanted to be.  First, the day started off with a weird noise from the back of my car.  5 O'clock in the morning on race day and I think I have a bearing problem or something.  Turns out it was a strap vibrating on my bike rack of which I used for the first time in quite a while. --------  The race, a very flat course with a NE wind, about 75 degrees and partly cloudy.--------   I get there later that I wanted to, not late, but not really early either.  I get checked in (which went pretty fast) and find my assigned transition spot.  It turns out to be an excellent spot at the end of the second rack from the bike exit.  Get the bike set, wait in line 10 minutes to go to the bathroom and ran out of warm up time (the time I normally warm up on the bike).  Get the transition area set, get the wetsuit on (yes, it turned out to be a wetsuit race) and ran down to the water.  Got a good swim warm up and get staged the the start, I'm in the 4th wave.  Boom!!!  The cannon goes off and I'm sprinting in the water.  I must have sprinted about 200 yds cuz I got tired out and had to settle into a groove earlier than I wanted to.  I didn't think I was that far out but I guess I was and the sprint was longer than planned.  Well, I'm winded but still settled in and found a pair of feet to follow and stuck with them.  We swam by a bunch of people but I lost him about 200yds to go.  Got out of the water and ran fairly well to the transition area.  I wound up swimming 0:25:51, just better than my goal but the timing mat was at the transition area, not at the water exit so I was actually about a minute faster than that.  Out of T1 (1:16) and on the bike, rode out fast cuz of a slight tailwind, after a while we turned north into the wind on an abbrasive road, I caught several people there.  Then we turned east again and into some more wind, it had to be a 10 to 15 mph headwind cuz it was killing most people but being as short as I am, it doesn't affect me as much, I probably past the most people on that section.  About 1.5 miles to go I change gears so I bring my cadence up to about 100 rpm to get ready for the run.  Bike time 1:08:54, average HR 168 bpm, not too far off of my goal of 1:08:00  Into T2, about average time for me, (1:33) then off on the run.  Started at 8 min/mile pace then it dropped to 8:30 which I kept for the rest of the run.  That's good for me but I expected better.  My legs went as fast as they could carry me and that's all I could hope for.  Run time of 0:52:13, average HR of 167 bpm.  Yes, I know the bike HR was higher than the run.  Here is my explaination.  At the beginning of the bike my HR was in the 170's for the first 5 miles or so then it settled in about 164.  When I went into the wind it got up to about 169.  For the run it flattened out very quickly and stayed in the high 160's the whole way.  I sure didn't leave anything out on the course, not even on the run even though the HR numbers point that way.  I seem to be able to handle the suffering on the bike much better than the run, maybe that's cuz I came from cycling.  While training for Ironman, I practice running slow so I'm no surprised that my 10K times are not really fast, I will work on that next year.  One word to decribe the way I felt during the race would be "Durable."  Total time for the race 2:29:45, just under my goal of 2:30:00.

      Had a little built up energy in me so I did my brick a little harder than I planned.  18 mile bike at 0:56:00, 20.2 mph, 4 mile run in 0:33:16, 8:19 min/mile pace, that is fast running for me but I felt great.  Today was a speed work day for running allready, I just did the whole thing fast instead of doing a fartlek.  This is one heck of a confidence booster going into a race.  I have a new way of thinking for the run now, kind of hard to explain but I got it from a guy on Slowtwitch.com.  As well as concentrating on running form, I just go through my body checklist, first I say "Legs, are you OK?" then they reply with a yes/no, then I say "Lungs, are you OK?" they they reply with a yes/no, then I check my stomach, feet, head, arms or whatever else that I am using.  Sounds kind of silly but it seems to be a form of inspiration when needed.  Tomorrow is an easy 2 hour bike followed by a 2 to 3 mile easy run.  Probably swim a little bit too to work on left sided breathing and to have some fun.

      Went to Trout Lake to swim.  Swam with my club jersey on and wanted to know if there was going to be any speed difference with it.  I figured that it would be near 1 minute a lap and it turns out that it didn't really affect my speed in the water.  The time was very close to my non-wetsuit time from last saturday but I feel some more testing is needed and that gives me an excuse for more open water swimming.  -------- I saved my bike ride from yesterday for today so I could do a brick when I get home from work.  Nothing hard, just a smooth ride followed by a fartlek run.

      After yesterday's swim I thought that my run today was going to drag on but after I did my first gel at 3 miles, my mind and body perked up and I felt really great.  So good that I had to be carefull not to run to fast for a base run.  10 miles, 1:35:41, HR 149, nice partly cloudy day near 75 degrees.  I've been doing GU now for over 2 weeks and feel its effects are about the same as Cliff, maybe the pickup is a little faster but definitly lasts just as long and easier to get out of the package.  I'm going to tape the gels to my bike for the race this weekend instead of using the flask to see how it works.  I really felt that I could have gone a lot further today and am looking forward to the longer runs in the next couple of weeks.

      Today's swim was just Blaaahhhh!!!  Supposed to be 45 minutes and I swam 35.  Just not in the mood for swimming.  Seemed kind of drained of energy probably cuz I skipped lunch today.  Can't wait to get to open water again later this week.

      A day off, I was tempted to swim easy but decided to sit at home, clean my bike, cook dinner, watch TV and generally just rest.  Kind of got bored after watching reruns of "Friends" and "Seinfeld".  Went to bed early to get extra sleep.  ---------- The week ahead is an easy week and it includes a .75 hr swim on tuesday, 1.5 hr run on wednesday, .5 hr swim and 1 hr bike on thursday, .5 hr run test on friday, bike test on saturday plus some easy riding totaling 2 hrs and an Olympic distance race on sunday.  The swim portion will probably be without a wetsuit so I have changed my goal of 25 minutes to 29 minutes.  Still looking for 1:08:00 on the bike and most importantly 0:50:00 for the run.  I'm hoping to reap some of the benefits of the basework I've been doing to help me with this race.  This not being an "A" race, I'm not expecting to "Tear it up."  Wish me luck!!!

      Kind of got away from the plan a bit but here it goes. -------- Saturday:  easy long swim at Trout Lake with the club for 1:00:00, really swam by myself, then rode 57 miles in 3:05:00 HR of 135bpm.  Sunday: easy swim to kill some time before Rhonda got to the park, worked on left sided breathing for about 1000 yds then 96 miles on the bike in 5:26:00 HR 132bpm.  Nothing really exciting, just putting the miles in.

      Last work day of the week, avoided some arguments, fixed a lot of tough stuff with Tom's help of course and even squeezed in a swim at lunch. --------- OK back to training stuff.  --------  Friday training: 1500yds at lunch left me feeling good the rest of the workday, maybe it released some stress, still looking for the speed that I had back in June, yardage has been low last month and that's probably the reason.  I'm going to try to get back to 10,000 a week, even if it is really easy swims, I'll probably continue to swim at lunch about 3 times a week, I really enjoy that.  The run:  Since I cut wednesdays run from 2:30:00 to 1:45:00 I needed to make up some base time which is what I feel I need, so I changed my run today from 4 miles of speedwork (which is really 2 miles of speedwork and 2 miles of warmup and cool down) to 10 miles of base.  Nice weather to run in, maybe 78 degrees 1:38:23, HR of 149.  Very even run, felt crappy for the first mile 'till I warmed up then I felt great, did 1 gel at 3 miles and that was it.  I felt as if I could have run several miles further but didn't cuz I didn't want to go over my alloted run time this week.  Gettin' ready for my ride this weekend. Yee Haaaaaa!!!

      I swam during lunch, as previously said in the last post, then rode 33 miles on thursday evening.  Road with Roman and a friend, a little faster that I wanted  to (about 22mph) but I needed some tempo work anyway.  Found a bruise appearing on my left knee from where I hit my armrest on sunday.  I little sore but OK. -------- Weekend plans:  friday: middle distance run, approx 10 miles, saturday:  open water swim followed by a long bike (approx 100 miles), maybe a short run, sunday:  30-40 miles easy on bike followed by a 4 to 5 mile tempo run.  Next week is an easy week again, will be going down to 8.5 hours of training to recover from the last 3 and an Olympic distance race in Sylvania OH on sunday.  Goals for the race are 0:26:00 swim, 1:08:00 for the bike and 0:50:00 for the run.

      Took tuesday off too cuz it was Justin's birthday (my son).  We baked a cake and went out to dinner. -------- Wednesday I cut my long run down from 15 miles to 10 cuz I ran out of time.  Hines drive was flooded going east so I had to go west and run on the road.  Nice run, temp was about 75 degrees, time 1:37:30, HR at 145, kind of average for me.  I'm going to run another 10 on Friday instead of 6 and probably 5 on Sunday after the ride.  10 milers are really no big deal now since I've been going longer. -------- I swam this afternoon during lunch to get some yards in, probably do that again tomorrow.  Tonight is a bike ride, gonna try to hook up with Roman if I can but 30 to 40 miles at about 20 mph is the goal.

      Yesterday (monday) was a nice rest day.  I needed to heal up a bit from my incident on the bike on sunday.  I didn't write anything immediatly cuz I needed time to cool off from it.  What happened was as I finished the bike and was rolling back to my car, a guy in a small pickup truck pulled out from a parking spot right in front of me.  I was going about 5 mph and went over the bars as I locked up the front brake.  As I got up he was laughing, I asked him how many beers he had, then he shut up.  I should have called the police.  Another man in a car saw what happened and asked me if I was OK, I politly said I was fine and thanked him for checking on me. -------- I took a nap yesterday to get caught up on some rest, then went food shopping.  Today (tuesday) is Justin's birthday and I still need to bake his cake and get his present.  We have allready decided what he want's and just need to pick it up. -------- Today's training includes a long swim, I will probably keep it to just an hour and maybe do it during lunch so I can get home earlier.

      After an unscheduled rest day on thursday I slowly got back into training.  I just seemed tired after that long run on wednesday.  One more hard week and then an easy week is waiting for me.

Friday I swam a little (1500yds), not much but OK.  Saturday I got out on the bike for about 40 miles, flatted once but it was no big deal, when I got home I couldn't find the hole in the tube, maybe it was a valve leak.  I was just getting some miles in anyway.  Sunday was another big day, 2600 yds at Spring Mill Pond, 105 miles on the bike feeling very strong near the end, didn't have time to run after the ride but I feel that I would have run well.  Monthly totals:  Swim 22790 yds, very light for me, Bike 589 miles (what I concentrated on this month), run 76 miles, which is slowly on it's way up, I'm being very carefull with the running because of my knee.  Total training time for the month: 53:55:00.  Monday is my normal day off and I'm keeping it for another week.
