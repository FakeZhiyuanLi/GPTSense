						   Out of sheer boredom, I have recently started Googling the names of some of my old acquaintances and boyfriends.

Some of the results of my searches have surprised me: a handful of old high school buddies are now doctors; some are still single, some single with children, some divorced, some happily married. Some of my old friends are no longer in the Philadelphia metro area.

I have been desperately trying to find one of my old boyfriends in particular: Brian Lohr.

Brian Lohr was a guy that I was totally, shamelessly crazy about, in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years in college. We spent most of the summer of 1997 together, getting stoned, going to the movies, to the diner, talking about everything under the sun...and making out, bien sur. :-)

The rare occasions that I was apart from him, I was kept awake all night by my yearning thoughts of him: his smile, his laugh, his warm mouth on top of mine. I absolutely ACHED for him, in the way that only lovesick 19 year-old girls can.

Brian was probably the closest thing to a soul mate that I may ever have had. We understood each other perfectly. He was sensitive, quiet yet funny, somewhat shy, smart as a whip, and incredibly, incredibly hot. Just the thought of him made me drool all over myself.

At some point, I had bought this small, green book called "Getting to Know You." It was a book of questions, such as "Name the three things in life that frighten you the most," or, "If you had only 24 hours left to live, what would you do?" Basically, the kind of conversational fodder that is perfect for semi-intellectual stoners. I don’t know what made me show it to him, but as soon as I did, he was immediately interested in it, and seemed to expect me to share it with him.

And so, we spent entire nights, from midnight till sunrise, poring through this book together, while lounging on vinyl lawn chairs in his dimly lit backyard. We took turns asking each other the questions, and discussing our answers at length.

I realized that I really loved him when, one night, around 3:30, I asked him (from the book), "Who is your best friend?"

He looked at me and said softly, "You are."

SWOOOOOON!!!!! Yes, I loved him. I really did.

There were some problems, of course. The two big problems were:

1. Although he and I did everything together, he refused to call me his "girlfriend." He said he did not want to put a label on our relationship. This bothered me immensely. Why should he get the benefits that came from my company (read: sexual, intellectual, amusement) if he didn't want to recognize our status as a couple; and,

2. We had some difficulties in the bedroom, if you know what I mean. We spent hours kissing, touching, exploring—but when it came time for the act...poof! The moment was gone. I guess that, technically, we only ever consummated our relationship ONCE. That was it.

But still, I loved him. It didn’t matter to me.

Until I met David, who would be my last serious relationship before I met my husband. David was just about the polar opposite of Brian, but most of all, he had no problem with the boyfriend/girlfriend label.
I actually managed to date both of them simultaneously for a while, even going to a Rage Against the Machine/WuTang Clan concert with the two of them. Looking back, I’m sure they both knew what was up, but I was just enjoying myself at the time.

Then, a week or two after the concert, David asked me to be his girlfriend. As in, exclusively. As in, there would be no other people for either of us.

Honestly, I can’t remember much about those days (I was a MAJOR stoner back then), and I can’t recall how difficult it was for me to decide what to do about Brian. If I knew then what I know now, I can say with 100% definitiveness that I would have—and should have—stuck with Brian Lohr.

I can tell you, however, that after David asked me to date only him, Brian and I were hanging out, as usual—making out in my car, in fact—when I dropped the bomb on him. The conversation is hazy, but I can remember this much:

Me: “This probably isn’t the best time to bring this up…”

Him: “Yeah?”

Me: “Well, David asked me to be his girlfriend, and to go out with only him…and I said yes.”

Him: “What? Why? How could you do this, without talking about it with me first?”

If my memory serves me correctly, Brian was crushed. I wish that I could recall more from that incident, but that’s it. And I never saw him again. It was August 1997.

Fast-forward a few years ahead, sometime in early 2000: While paging through our local daily paper, I see a little blurb about Brian. He’s in the Air Force, studying bioengineering, and living in Arkansas WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

Whaaaaaaa???????

My little heart was torn in two when I read it. How could he be married, when he didn’t even want to call me his girlfriend? How could he have a child, when we could barely ever manage to have sex?

Since then, I have thought of Brian Lohr on and off again, but not with much frequency. In April 2000, I met my husband (also named Brian). We were married in September 2002. We are happy; I am blessed. And I know it, and am grateful for all that I have. I would never leave him. We have our dreams, and our goals, and our memories. Too much to risk on post-adolescent crushes.

In the past six months, though, I have been having recurring dreams about Brian Lohr. Frighteningly realistic, as dreams go. Not in a nightmarish type of way, though. More like dreams in which I encounter Brian again, and he tells me that he loves me, and I am in a raw state of panic—do I leave my Brian to go back to this one? What about his daughter? And what happened to his wife?

I usually wake up, sweating, from these dreams, in the early morning hours, long before our alarm goes off. I find myself so troubled—or is it energized? by these dreams, that, without even so much as a glance at my sleeping husband, I quietly dress in my workout clothes, and slip outside with my Walkman, to walk off the images in my mind.

Does he ever think of me? I have to wonder if I ever make appearances in his dreams, as he does in mine.

He lives in Texas now. I found that out through a new employee here at work, Julie, who grew up with him. His daughter is probably 3 or 4 years old now. I don’t know if he is still married.

One day, about a month ago, I could no longer take these dreams. So I called the Air Force—Lackland AFB, to be exact. I asked the operator for Brian Lohr. And I was connected!!! So easy. Why didn’t I do this before?

Unfortunately, a female coworker of his answered, and told me that he had just left the day before for a month-long officer training.

Could she give me his email address? Why, certainly! In less than ten seconds, I had his email address. She even offered to forward me to his home phone number—which makes me a little concerned for the overall state of military confidentiality, but that is another matter altogether.

So I emailed him last month. You never know.

Brian Lohr, if you are reading this now, please email me. I’d love to hear from you and see what you’re up to these days.

Hope you’re well. Thanks for reading.

						   I have been pining for canine companionship ever since I had to put down my sweet yellow Lab, Nikki, in April 2000.

My husband is not a dog person. He thinks they're sloppy, ugly, and too much work. He fails to see the positive in having a dog. What was I thinking, marrying a man who holds these beliefs???

Anyway, back in late June, I worked with a local Greyhound adoption group to foster a retired racing hound with intent to adopt, if everything went well.

It didn't.

Not that Speed (racing name: Stylin' Speed) wasn't a great doggie: she was smart, friendly, and low-key, as most Greyhounds tend to be. She just had major separation anxiety issues. She needed to be in a home where either she could be with another dog, or where someone human was home with her most of the time. Apparently, the company of our two cats, Bailey and Sebastian, just didn't cut it for her.

So we had to give her back. I held it together better than expected, which surprised me. I knew she wasn't happy with us. Well, she was happy WITH us, but as we both work full-time, she was unhappy when she was alone.

I have been repeatedly broaching the topic with Brian (the husband) since then; he has finally said that we can discuss doing it again after we return from our vacation in Aruba in late September. Good enough for me.

That still doesn't stop me from going to Petfinder.com on a daily basis, pulling up photos of adoptable hounds, and wishing that late September were already here.

Still waiting to hear on the status of the promotion....

						   Well, here I am. I didn't think I would succumb to blogging, as I am not very good about posting regularly, but I guess I'll give it a go!

See my profile for more details about moi.

						   I guess I should start by telling you that I'm awaiting news of a possible promotion here at my current workplace.

I've been with ABC, Inc. for over 3 years. I'm ready for a new challenge (and a payraise!).

If I get this promotion (IhopeIhopeIhope), my new role will be visiting all of our clients in the Philadelphia region to conduct retirement plan enrollment meetings.

I had a phone interview this morning with the hiring manager, in our Buffalo office. I got some good vibes from her, but I don't want to jinx anything, so I'll refrain from adding more about the conversation. I will say that she told me that she expects to reach her decision in the next day or so.

Hmmm...let's see.....what else?

My husband and I have been happily married, and will celebrate our 2nd anniversary next month. We're going to vacation in Aruba at the end of September.

After that, two things: I'm hoping to convince him that we need to adopt a dog; specifically, a retired racing Greyhound.

Also, I will resume my studies with the University of Phoenix online program after we get back from Aruba. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through it, but I love it! The workload is absolutely punishing, but I have managed to keep a GPA of 3.93. Yay, me!!

Any questions? :-)
