      Hey I meant to finish the blogging last nite, but didn't have the time! Sorry, my dear devoted readers! (Bows mockingly). Anyway I bullied nehneh a few days ago, by posting a v v bad message on his tagboard. Something to do with him being v holier-than-thou, I believe. Something abt him juz rubs me the wrong way. I blew up at him that morning when he told me I was being "extra", though he probably doesn't noe. I was simmering for a v long while in class, even though I noe it was a v stupid thing to be angry over. Nevertheless, tt still does not stop me from being quite irritated at his attitude. Needless to say, alot of pple blasted me on nananael's blog, and im even more irritated over tt. That cousin Jun of his especially. I noe its wrong but tt's juz how I feel!! I also seem to be losing my temper much more often now, and always quite dramatically. I blew up at my brother last nite and had quite a fight with him, but pple with his and nehneh's attitude are sooo irritating! Gabriel is b!tching abt his sister again, on his blog. Relax, im not one to use vulagarities often, just quoting from Gab himself. I'd much rather trade my brother for his sis! I fail to see how sisters can be worse than brothers. Just to get the record straight, here are several traits I hate in&nbsp;a person: Self righteousness. This is the worst, and in nat's blog entries, he often seems to be like this. Don't believe me? Go look at his blog yourself. Ah, im at it again. I shall pray for guidance, heck, why not now? Ok, finished. Then again, i dislike hypocrites, but I also fall into this category. Surprised? Don't be. I am a reprehensible human being, and rely on God to guide me(I hope). Had to do a Christian survey today, I felt so guilty because I didn't noe wad to put down. You see, im not a v devoted Christian, not like Oliver. I have my doubts, and wad i belive in is not entirely canon. I am a very insecure person indeed. Anyway, Now I've abt completed this self slamming entry, I shall go do something else. Wouldn't u like to noe what? Heheh.

      I feel so guilty, remorseful, wadeva...so many daes neva update liao. Haiz..Timwee said he is going to get some1's new hp no. for me! Actually I would prefer to get it myself, budden how? I'll try tommorrow, then if cannot, then timwee to the rescue! I was v bad to Timwee over the phone, because I felt a bit down abt the whole hp thing(some1 said would tell me if got a new hp..I'm still waiting). So when Timwee said tt he wouldn't be coming for chess training tommorrow, I was like, "Good". Aiya, I feel so low down to vent my spleen on poor timwee. Anyway boot polish rox! While the NS thing is a bit cliche, it was delived originally. And the Filipino totally owns la! Wow, pro... Pity im not going to the drama or music or wadeva tommorrow, so i wun see Gab, but i got chess training,very diff to reach school in time. Haha, now I have logged 1 more blog entry, I can slp peacefully. :)

      Dang! Aiya juz got zero! for my maths quiz online. I hate sine rule and cosine rule! I mean, why me?! Wait a sec, I'm whining. Oops. Anyway today juz had a terrible day. 1. I got LY irritated at me, now she's blocking me. Aiya, oversensitive lah, budden a feel abit bad!? but seriously, she had no reason to block me. Nvm lor, not my prob anymore. 2. BZ is spreading the SK gang thing around in class, and he and Kaleni are v irritating. At times like this, i don't regret blocking Gabriel, I mean, he deserves it for inducting BZ. Now BZ seems to be impersonating me on the SK blog...dotz. Anyway, bad day, maybe tommorow will be better rite, it can't be worse, unless I really screw up my Chinese O lvl orals.

      I know I neva thot i would ever use a blog. Firstly, I lack the free time to spend on it. However, pressing concerns have driven me to create this blog. I need a diary, but I dun wan it where my siblings or parents can browse through it at their leisure! Besides, i think it shd be quite nice to have somewhere where i can say juz wat i wan to say. I wonder though, if any1 will eva bother to read wad im typing anyway, other than myself. On another note, who will i wan to read this? at most maybe timwee, or other trusted pple. Anyway, I am starting this blog! gotta get going!

      I'm blogging a few days ahead, but I will neva forget the last day of interclub manz...It was so cool!!Somehow my team managed to win 1st!!Ahead of the Com. Sch U11, and RJC. While I unfortunately lost the last match to Clifford Tan, I somehow managed to tyco Joash Ee again! I mean, I have the same kind of negative relationship wif clifford as Joash does wif me...I seem doomed to lose to clifford but beat joash...Anyway, even beta den tt was tt suz managed to draw i leong! Cool rite! And solomon's mum treated me to bowling! At first I was very scared and nervous one...but amazingly tyco. I suppose beginner's luck really holds true after all...I managed to get a strike in the very first ball!! and in the end I got 94 points! woohoo! bowling is so much fun! But solomon is even more pro lor, despite (probably purposely) getting 0 in the first frame, he managed to get 122 points! Pro rite...However, when I went back to bowl wif timwee later (too overconfident liao) I only got 56 points...nevermind, i only juz started to learn. I muz remember to keep calm, whenever I get too excited I bowl terribly. Good news is, this year inter team is at Safra toa payoh, so i think I can go bowl afterwards too! :) Truly, my cup overfloweth with blessings...I muz remember to thank God for my sucesses, and spur myself on to greater heights! Now i noe why the sports teams always thank God for His guidance and blessing...It is truly awesome! God rox!! hahaha...Oh yah muz remember the BK incident...Gabriel koped BK's phone, then BK was like supa pissed, want to call police, then me and timwee were like persuading him not to, and I called Gabriel up and whatnot...then he settled for bashing up Gabriel. At least me and gabriel seem to be back on speaking terms again..I suppose i also have Him to thank for tt. Still, i dunno whether gab thinks of me as a fren, but I decided it doesn't really matter, i still think of him as my best fren and tt's all that really matters(or am i just deluding myself? Hope not :))

      Its the Interclub! My team consists of Lee Wei Long, BK, LWW(hu is only playing 1 round!), myself, solomon sia, and bryan hooi. First round was relatively easy, I managed to beat Jordan Yap's dad. I played some cool move Bc7!!(divinely inspired. I must really thank gGod for the sucesses I have enjoyed so far in this tourney), capitalizing on his backrank weakness. Played too fast, though, so only won a pawn, I think. Surprisingly, weilong drew dominic's dad, but no-one really blames him lar. Such things happen to every1.(tt situation might change by the last round though :))Second round I also won, by the grace of God. Cheapoed Jordan yap a pawn, after he played tt weak opening against Caro. Just cheapoed in complications, nothing really special. Third round unfortunately only managed to dram, after acheiving a positionally superior position against a 1689 player. Now for the results of the other players: Great Upsets. Firs round Timwee won tt Iana trainer! pro rite! And its not he first time either. I'm beginning to get an iferiority complex just looking at these pple. Round 2 upset: Suzanna Sia acheived a superior position against Sean Tan, but drew. Still not bad, RI team drew 2-2 overall tt round. Every1 in both teams drew. Round 3 Gabriel beat Chan Peng Kong! At the risk of sounding oversentimental and petulant, i must honestly say i wasn't too happy abt that. I mean, its all well and fine for gabriel and the rest, but I feel very inferior to those pple, hu can draw or even beat IMs. Still, its not v nice to say: "hey how the heck u win? I was hoping u would lose!" or something like that. Besides, I also dint feel very happy for a variety of other reasons. Number 1: I'm still irritated at Gabriel. He hasn't said a single word to me other than repititively mocking me in an irritating tone. Number 2: I think I feel quite a bit more insecure?! The fact that he doesn't seem to mind even when I'm having this really big argument wif him, and even when I mind so much, says something about how he regards me. It simply doesn't seem very important to me. It might sound a little silly (or actually a lot silly) that I dun like the fact that he seems able to be so dismissive, so inconsequential to him. His life just keeps going on, but I am like, fixated?, on this crazy argument. Anyway, I haven't spoken a word to gabriel today either. i have just asked wee to help me in a plan: Tok to gabriel over msn and find out wad he really thinks. Of course, I have my strong suspicions tt he doesn't care either way, but it is worthwhile to find out either way. I can at least find out if it is worth my time and trouble trying to salvage my friendship with gabriel, or is it simply wrecked beyong repair. I wan to go somewhere else other than a hawker center tml for lunch la, I dun care...I actually asked bryan wad he thought: Is pride more important than friendship? If it was simply a matter of tt alone though, I think my frenship would be more important to me. However, I also dun really noe if there is a frenship in the first place, or even if its wrecked beyond repair. But as bryan put it, Pride doesn't really have a value anyway, whereas Friendship is worth more than gold... Still, on a different n brighter(slightly) note, i will be playing Joash Ee tml. I tink I will get screwed, but u neva noe. tyconess has its benefits... :) with God on our side, who shall we fear? No-one of course, but I dun noe if He wans me to win. He might have other plans. I will try my best to accept them though, even if they seem bad to me in the short term, such as if I lose. "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD. Plans to help you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." On this (divinely inspired?) note, I shall end this blog entry. Its really quite late already, anyway. Good nite, my alter ego!

      Cool! Our C div rugby team has just won gold! That means we will probably have a holiday on Wednesday!! Super long weekend :) Oh, btw, I told wee abt my blog yesterday, so perhaps this blog now has a audience. Anyway, I just had a mega shouting match with my elder brother over some lame thing, I hesitate to say exactly wad. But its really lame lor. Today had chess training in lieu of going to the rugby match, so pro rite? Surprisingly enuff, many of the chess players tt could have gone for the traing instead opted to go root for the rugby match. I mean, Nat is understandable, after all he is a B div rugger, but even Bunny and wei cheng opted to go root for rugby! Still, more power to them I say. That's why we got holiday! I know I have alot of homework due really soon, but im not sure exactly wad. It's a scary feeling, i can tell u, being stuck without much apparent work on one hand, and waiting for the teachers to scream at u the next day. i noe I got the Chi test on Fri, perhaps I will go study tt later! Today got some lame fire drill, took out 1 period of Chi, but tts ok, I will just have to study it tonite or tommorrow. My IRS teacher didn't kill me u noe, actually said I did some work for once. I think my little bro noes (or thinks he does) abt Suz. I caught him trying to break my password by keying tt in...stupid family members, so irritating and over inquistive. I can't think of wad to do over the com now...I might go study soon. Bye! Ok, my bro juz apologised. Im not irritated anymore! :)

      See? See?! I told u pple I wasn't cut out to blog. I haven't blogged for nearly 2 whole wks! In my own defense, I had e stupid magic squares assignment due last wk, so cannot really blog. Schoolwork really stressful lar, no other way to put it. Anyway I shall try and make up for not blogging by putting an extra long post here, like the last one. Today BZ told my tt Gabriel doen't think of me as a fren. Some1 asked hu is Gabriel den BZ answered "Kia Hua's best fren...or he tinks of Gbariel tt way lar. Actually Gabriel doesn't think of Kia Hua as a fren", or something liddat. I doubt I can adequately express how hurtful tt comment was, but I just passed it of like nothing in front of BZ(after all, hes like one of the pple hu I hate the most in sch, AND hes the reason I'm daoing Gab in the first place). But seriously, I felt very sad when I heard tt lor. I only hope BZ is exaggerating. Do you noe how hurtful it is to hear that some1 whom I've alway liked and admired thinks of me tt way? I may have my differences with Gabriel, but beyond that, I've always thot I had a strong bond of friendship with him. Still, this seems to say otherwise...Should I still call Gabriel up? I mean, pride seems like a small thing when a friendship I've alway depended on is at stake. But that also leads me to wonder; was it ever there in the first place? Perhaps all the friendship was actually just a mirage, never there in the first place. The only way I can find that out is by waiting, waiting...What is my friendship with Gabriel based on, if ever it was there in the first place? As much as I hate to admit it, BZ's words have a ring of truth to them. They may not be entirely true, but they are definitely not entirely without basis either. I mean, when I look back on my shared experiences with Gabriel, I can still find meaning in the words he said, wad he did...perhaps it was just a case of me seeing only what I wanted to see. As any1 can see from my typing above, I am a very sentimental and insecure person indeed. Thank God no-one ever will. Still, I cannot take my mind away from Gabriel. This leads me to the question; who is/are my true fren(s)? Timothy Wee? Yes indeed, but then again he is every1's best fren. Bryan? Similar reasoning. Nat Ong? I've had my differences with him, and ya, well, while he is still one of my better frens, he is not That close to me. My brother? There are plenty of things I do not, and cannot confide in him about. Now we come back to Gabriel. Gabriel? So I thought....This is one of the more painful experiences in my life. Imagine, the friend of so many years deserting me...awww, as LY would say. Still, I have my pride to cling to, and I shall not desert it to chase after a friend who might never have been a fren. I shall not desert it, not as my erstwhile friends have deserted me. I can, however, hope that either BZ or Gabriel was exaggerating when they said those words...Btw, Nat Ong fell sick today. Throat infection or something. If he is not better by tomorrow, I might go to his house to visit him...but I have chess training. Haiz...I dunno which to go for! I shd stop being so self pitying though...its honestly quite disgusting to myself, i dunno why I typed tt in the first place...
