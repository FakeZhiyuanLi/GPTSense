      The best things to put in yakisoba: pork, bean sprouts, cabbage, spinach, mushrooms, egg whites. The smell takes me back to a year and a half ago. Well, I got about two hours of formal sleep last nite. But I'm actually not tired. This getting up at 8am on weekends is not cool. And naps aren't my thing, i feel like i'm wasting precious time. I think I'll read a book or study Japanese.   Books! I'm enjoying James Watson's book  Double Helix , about how he and Francis Crick came upon the structure for DNA. Not only is his telling of the story fun and far from being dry, but its interesting to see how science progressed at that time and how labs run now. Another factor to that is the setting is in England and I'm here in College Station, Tx, USA. I'm not sure how the labs function there. But thats beside the point, its all interesting. Long live DNA. ^_^

      So I get into the lab and my cells don't seem to want to grow. I only had about 26,600 cells per mL, so I would need almost 45 mL to seed the plates. So much for that. Re plated and hopefully they will be ready on Monday evening. Monday will be hectic, 8am is work, 12:45 is Japanese class, back to work, get out around 5:30, go to the other lab, probably skip the work out and head straight to Fox and Hound for the Monday beer night with my friends. I don't drink the beer, I usually have a nice iced tea with creamer. ^_^   As for now, I can't decide between taking a nap, reveiw study for Japanese, or play on the computer. Oh, what excitement my life holds.

      I'm up at 7:26am, perking coffee, having a protein shake. No headache, but i went to bed at 2:30. The difference? Today is Saturday. I'm going into the cancer lab to start my week long cell proliferation studies, which means I have to go in tomorrow fairly early as well. Its not too bad because; One- This is the lab I really enjoy, Two- It makes me happy that Dr. Safe gave it to me directly rather than through the grad students, Three- I'll be happy to see what kind of results I can get on my own.   Classes start on Monday, I only have Japanese then. I was going to do a quick and intensive reveiw of all my Japanese that I should know from over a year ago. Probably tomorrow afternoon, or maybe even today while I'm watching Trading Spaces with friends. I love languages, if you know some other language and are willing to teach it, I'm always willing to learn as much as time will alow. So far, I can read the English, Korean, and two of the Japanese alphabets. I used to know around 300 Chinese characters from Japan, but I'm sure I don't anymore. I want to re-learn Spanish again, I think I could. Okay, off to the lab.

      I'm up again at 7:30am, drinking a new protein shake and perking coffee. My head has an ambient ache to it, one the will annoy me if I get in a bad mood, but other wise can ignore. Alchohol is evil. Makes your head hurt, empty calories, and makes me think far far far too much about things. Note to self: drink only when the situation is one that you feel comfortable in when sober or else bad emotions kick in.

      So I sit up at 1:50am Friday morning, eating microwaved frozen dumplings and thinking "What exactly do I expect? What do I think I'm getting myself into?" If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can ask. Perhaps I'll tell you depending on the mood you catch me in. Perhaps just another reminder that I'm made for something more than College Station, so don't get too comfy here.

      Today Dr Safe actually complimented me on my success at the cell proliferation experiments and asked that I do some with compounds 1,4,9 and 11 on pancreatic cancer lines one and twenty eight. Yay! For once, my work is appreciated and trusted! Well, looks like now I might be on the road to getting own projects and such from that lab? That would be great.... man, if there was ever a tech or even student worker position open in that lab, I would drop the cotton lab in a heart beat. The atmosphere in the Safe lab is way cooler. And Dr Safe is way cooler than Dr. Yu, but I think you already got that idea.   "are you a plant with a mustache?" That made me laugh. I think Sudhakar was excited that I actually showed intrest in his music rather than cutting it down like everyone else does.

      Being single has pushed me to experience this whole new world created by Humanity that apparently never came into the walls of my far too sheltered life. I'm learning again to deal with this. And I have found my most common reaction to these new things is   Um... oookaaay~~?

      So everyday I keep a running count of my calories (not to exceed 2300 on a normal day) and my protein intake (must hit 143g a day, more if I go over 2000 calories). I think that whey protien in vanilla tastes actually pretty good in Crystal Light Rassberry Tea. I think Boca Burgers are the greatest because two patties and two slices of fat free Kraft cheese are 280 calories and 36g of protein. I won't eat on a bun 'cause that brings in too many refined carbs and the carbs I do eat are from protein bars and whole wheat tortillas. When I buy clothes, I determine what I want to wear based on if it makes my arms and back look cool. I'm obssessed with buying work out clothes. I find myself mocking models in magazines cause I could break them in half.   I never thought it would be so addicting.   On a different note, I'm a complete fool for bread. Total weakness for someone who avoids refined flour and sugar and *sigh*. The muffins that the HEB bakery has are my pitfall. I always find a way to justify why I   need   that muffin.    Ways for a guy to catch my attention: ~ casually flaunt intelligence, I'm a sucker for brains ~ make me laugh, if you can make me fall over, you've got me ~ bring/bake me any sort of bread product (you can't eat flowers, and chocolates make me sick after a few)

      I got bored this weekend, everyone was preoccupied or out of town, so I went to Austin to visit the brother and a friend. One perk of being single (just one of them) is that I don't have to answer to someone else and work around another person's schedule. When I was attached, I couldn't just pick up and drive to another city to hang for a night. And it didn't help that my ex fought any attempt to bring him out of his "safe zones". So Austin it is, and thats   where its at!!  Why can't College Station or Houston be more like that? I can walk almost everywhere. And I did.   I visited my friend Rubin, who I have known since junior high. Went to a party with him and ate dinner at his place with some of his friends. It was a good time. I don't feel like if I go there I have to have a crazy time, it was subdued and comfy. I also got to hang with the bro, which is always cool. I'm going to have to go back sometime in September, so long as my schedule doesn't get too crazy. I also need to go to Dallas-Forth Worth to visit Hedish and Tommy, but I'll probably go when there is a judo tournament and stay longer since thats just such a long drive to make alone.

      I felt really skinny the other day. The smallest pantie size I could find was a size 5, which is for hip size 36-38 inches, but I measured myself at 35 inches. Of course, there are girls way skinnier than me, so I dunno what they do. And of course, that says nothing about my overall physique. But I smiled anyways.

      For a good time I did this in College Station:  ~Walked around and made dinner with no shirt on. One perk to living alone. ~Went to Walmart to "splurge" and treat myself to my favorite protein supplements and a set of work out clothes. ~Edited the html here to get the colors how I like. Thats a big thing for me, I know  nothing  about computers.  ~Did more decorating to my Hideaway (or apartment as they are commonly called). I dunno, its weird, kind of like an oriental cafe?

      So a bug crawled into my light socket yesterday. Instead of trying to pry him out or anything, I taped it shut. He'll starve or suffocate eventually. I've seen him try to escape, since its the clear scotch tape. I'll leave that there as a warning to other bugs that try to disgrace my apartment. Watch yourself.   I got to play with mice today. We are breeding mice for some experiments this fall. They are awfully cute little critters, too bad we have to inject or feed them various chemicals and probe their innards.  We've decided that I can hold the mice and Kathy, the grad student, will do the injecting. I hate needles and she hates holding mice. I think that works out pretty well. ^_^

      There is no fun like a half a bottle of Port and  Super Troopers  in the VCR.    This is why I was almost late to work today.   I need a good book, I really do. Living on my own is an experience that I'm still getting used to. It rocks and is rough. But great news! A friend of mine fixed my desktop up so that it kind of acts as a router for the laptop. Now they are both on the internet. He also downloaded Kazaa Lite and Ad Aware, and the laptop is much much faster now. Well, only one much. Now I can sit in my undies at both computers and waste time more efficiently.   Work was super slow because I didn't have time to make my coffee and I forgot my MD Player. At least work is better than it used to be. Before, I just sat around until someone had work for me to do. Now, with both techs gone, I get to play Temp-Tech. Not that it's exciting, it's just something to do and sometimes I actually have to think, which is a shock for the job, but a nice change. I still prefer my credit lab work over the paid lab work any day.   Artichoke? Artichoke!!!

      I am currently waiting for my graduate student to return and direct me for today's work. In the meantime, I'm here.   Since I'm not at work, I would like to vent a bit. I work at the USDA ARS in College Station, Tx in a cotton genomics lab. I spend most of my time doing PCR on DNA from various lines and hybrids of cotton, analyzing the products and summarizing that. Eventually, this is supposed to lead to the sequencing of the genome. (We already have BAC libraries, mind you.) Well, a co-worker has been there for four years now and hasn't seen one publication come from this lab. Yeah, so really, what happens, is I take my PCR scores, stick them in a binder, and they sit there for eternity. Now, since I'm only a student worker, and I wouldn't get on the authors list if I wanted, this wouldn't bother me if it weren't for the freak of a boss that I have.   Everyday, at least once an hour, he pops into the lab to make sure we are working. He makes his rounds to each person, asks what they are doing and what they are going to do next, then proceeds to repeat back what they told him as though this was a new order that he thought of. Riiight. Then, he likes to tell me exactly what it is that I'm doing, as though I wasn't already doing it. If I didn't know that template DNA was essential to a PCR reaction, I wouldn't be doing it. Yeah, that sort of thing. And when someone gets on your nerves, everything they do bothers you. Like, his B.O., his wearing the same clothes day in and day out, everytime he's in the lab, he has gloves on whether he is going to do work or not. And the last straw, one technician under him had a break down, one flat out quit after a month, and the current new research scientist has come to the office crying because of him. Yay. I just keep telling myself, this is just for the money, take it and you'll get a good recommendation out of him for later.   Good things in my life: Basically, all things outside of work rock. And work is only 5 out of 24 hours, or 25 hours of the 168 hours in a week. Things are looking bright through and through.

      Well, I thought of a bunch of things at work to let out. ^_^  As many know,  I broke up (again) with a guy who has a severe communication problem and isn't too keen on what commitment means. I've been asked several times if I would consider dating him if he came crawling back another time. I tell them, you break up once, could be a mistake. Break up twice, its not meant to be. Break up a third time, and you've become a doormat. No way I'm letting him walk all over me again.   As for what a girl wants in a relationship, well, don't ask us cause we really don't know until we are there.   More to come after my work out.

      So this is going to start out kind of slow, getting used to the whole idea.    Well the other day a guy asked me if I was an amateur body builder.... I don't think I'm that far along, and if I do start to get veins in weird places (like the backs of my arms or something), please tie me down and feed me donuts. Other than that, I think I'll grab another Promax bar.   Just today, my friend that introduced me to this posted my dirty fish limerick:  There once was a guy who liked fish One day he was craving the dish. So he went out to flirt And got under a skirt And this satisfied his wish.   (He made a request for them, I'm not just prone to this sort of thing.... well, not all the time)

      I was walking away from class this evening, and I thought, "Wow, look at all these young, beautiful people." There are so many of them. And i started thinking about how nice it is to be among them, and I like to think, one of them. And how short this time is that we get to be part of this group. We aren't the high schoolers who are still fumbling trying to learn about life, we aren't the adults who are set in their ways and routines. And I'm not just talking about looks that are beautiful, but the whole embodiment of what we are; life, energy, dreams, hopes, opportunities, drive, visions, oh the vision we all have. Cause the beautiful, young people will always be here. But we will grow older and into ourselves, no longer to interact in the same way as we do now. And I feel it creeping up. It is so far away, yet right around the corner. I know, I am only 22 and have no right to lament about getting/being old. But sometimes the pace of life doesn't let you do anything else but get old. We are constantly striving, moving, pushing, reaching, going ang going, getting to that next step. Today I was out of lab early and had sometime. All I wanted to do was slow down my pace and stroll to my next destination, yet within a minute or two I'd have to force myself to slow down again. We are so used to moving so fast its second nature to us.   I won't be young forever, but I am now.   Salmon and Spinach Salad with Honey Dijon Dressing. I think I over cooked the salmon a bit, but it made the seasonings into this crispy layer on top and that actually turned out really well.   Test on Thursday morning, but its already 11:30 tonite. I don't think I'll get to study tonite much. Perhaps I'll study one of my languages.

      The first month of the semester is almost under belt and I think I have survived pretty well. Juggling my time between things has been a killer to my social life, but I feel like it will all pay off in the end. Don't ask me how just yet, I'm still waiting for that to be shown to me.   I started a Bible study class at Grace Bible Church, and it is wonderful. I love hearing the insight to scripture that the leader has. This is just what I need, cause I feel like I had been adrift for a bit. It helps keep me focused on whats important, and teaches me the importance of balancing the present and future.   I've also started Chinese lessons with some other ladies. My co-worker, Jian Min, is teaching it. So as one of my friends put it, in a few months, if you were to dump me anywhere in East Asia, I will be able to get around. ^_^ I'm losing my Korean at an alarming rate, so if anyone one has the patience and know-how to teach me, I'm all for it. It will certainly be easier than Chinese, thats a mental and tonal excersize.   The weather, oh my word, in the morning and evening its so wonderful. Not like a normal Texas September at all. I want to go and just lay on the grass somewhere. Damn my busy schedule. Where is my time for hill days?!?!

      I am loving having my own kitchen, the Food Exploration in Cooking continues.   A new favorite combo: Salmon and Stir Fry!! I cook the salmon the same way, but in the last ten minutes I stir fry up veggies in seasame oil and Korean bulgogi sauce. oishii!! Or since its Korean sauce, mashita! And because you all want to know what goes in my mouth, the veggies of choice I think are bell pepper, squash, bean sprouts, carrot shavings, snow peas, and mushrooms. All those colors together also make it really festive looking. OKay, I have to run, wanted to share my bliss. Bai!!

      So last nite, I decided to go help with the beginner judo practice. But the second part of that Daniel used me to get some conditioning work in. Then for team practice, only six of us showed up, so we did an hour and a half of conditioning drills. Uchikomis up and down the room, practice fighting with eyes closed, then my absolute not favorite, jump over the person then run under the legs over and over and over again. So today, I'm moving really slowly. But I found out that I'm only 4lb over my target. Thats a relief.   Last Wednesday, w had a substitute for the Japanese class, and it was an actual Japanese person, I think he was a grad student. It was so much fun. He spoke in only Japanese most of the time unless someone was completely clueless. He was doing drills of "This or this, which one is more (adjective)." So he goes up to a guy and is like "Kare to kanojo, dochi no hoo ga suki desu ka?" (Guys or girls, which one do you like?) Not everyone knew those words, but Shae and I were cracking up. So fun. Thats how classes in Japan were.   Well, I know that through some friends I can get to Japanese students here to practice speaking. And if I'm feeling brave, I could go to the sushi bar and speak to the Korean guy there that knows Japanese.   My co-works said they will teach me Chinese. They taught me good morning, good afternoon, and good nite. I also learned bad egg, but when I called my friend that, I said it wrong. Blast. I love languages though. I'll learn anything anyone is willing to teach me.

      I'm so busy, the only friends I really get to see are the ones trying to throw and choke me.   And I love it.   Judo wears me out and makes me so happy. I  need to start losing my 5lb for the upcoming tournament. Weigh ins are in 8 days, no problem. Except I'm always hungry!! If I weigh myself today, I'm sure I'll get a reality check. At least its only 5 and not 12 like last spring. Yay me!  I didn't go to the REC today, or MOnday for that fact. I'll have to go both days of the weekend. Tis okay, I don't have to go into the lab.   Okay, more laters, off to judo practice.

      So what if I don't get to eat dinner until 10:30 or 11pm on Tuesday or Thursday. The food I eat makes me happy. I think I have a new favorite dish. I bake salmon sprinkled with marjoram and rosemary and doused in lemon pepper seasoning. Then in the last two minutes, I get together a spinach salad with fat free italian dressing. That with my diet Dr Pepper, man, and I've found happiness.   Before that was judo. Today was mostly instruction. I did some free fighting with Jennifer and helped teach some new people. My judogi smelled cause it still needs to be washed and it sat in a bag all day today in my car. Yuck. I had it laid out before that to air out, but i just haven't had time to get laundry done. Won't be done tonite either. Jennifer also stepped on my back, which I needed like nothing else.   Before that was the REC. That Hee-tarded guy showed up towards the end of my work-out. Its makes me physically ill sometimes. But the lifting is going well, I actually did two sets of bench presses at 115, first set of ten reps and second set of eight (I think) reps. I'm moving up!   Before that was Anal Chem lab, where my lab partner didn't show up so I has both stations running and finished my lab way before most people did. PLUS I got a 10 of 10 on the first two labs. This is rare, plus the second lab I came in an hour late for and still finished early. Yeah, I rock.   Before that I got to leave the research lab early because Kathy had to go to a Grad Student Assoc. meeting. So I played on the computers in the SCC and yeah, good times.   Salmon and salad.

      Now that I have my act together I am finally starting to kick ass. Last week my Anal Chem experiment went really quickly and my results were all very close. I hope they are the right ones. I got a 10 out of 10 on the first lab, which from what I hear is rare. Thats some encouragement. Then in class, the first quiz from the prof (others were from TA) I get a 7 out of 10, but apperarently most people had 0-3 for a score. Yippee. And a 10 of 10 on the last one I got back today. Maybe this semester won't be too bad, just as long as I stay on top now that I'm there.   Yesterday I met (kinda) two Japanese guys. ONe is in my class and is fluent, the other is a friend of a friend, and is also from Japan. So maybe I will get to practice and learn at my own pace after all. Wednesday, I'm going to ask the classmate to help me and some friends on our Japanese since we have a test Wednesday. I'm not worried about the test, I just want a chance to brush up on my conversation skills. Apparently I impressed the other guy, though we were just writing online. Japanese is such a cool language.   Okay, off to play with mice.

      Good day today.   I did my day 6 count for the cell proliferations. So I don't have to go in on Sunday, yay! But Dr. Safe is giving me new cell lines and chemicals to work with I think. 'Tis okay, maybe I can delay it so that I will start it after this next weekend and take a vacation to another city.   Then I went to Sweet Eugenes with Ashley. The chai is to die for. Chai anywhere, with the steamed milk, yeah, tastes like Christmas. That and a low fat blueberry muffin. We then headed to Target where I got a new wallet, because the A&M one I had was litterally coming apart at the seams. I'm surprised things stayed in all this time. Barbra then showed up and we went to Ross and I got cheap shirts and a photo album. I figure if I get the album, I'll finally get pictures printed from my CD of digital photos.   I came home with a song in my heart and catfish in the freezer. Defrosted and covered it with lemon pepper season, some rosemary and something else. Was scrumtious. Then Bob calls and I go over to Valencio's, where others are eating BBQ and watching TV. Bob and Jackie went to Northgate and I'm waiting for Stan, Roy, or Hebert to call me back so that I can go hang with them when they get to Jaime's place.   I've come to a decision today. Since last weekend, yes a week ago, the guy I'm dating hasn't so much as tried to contact me. Whats more, when I do, I'm lucky if I get ahold of him. So you know what, nope. I've got too much stress and too much going for me now to deal with that. My tolerance for such things is thin, and I'd rather be single than try to deal. Its been over 24 hours since he said "I'm doing work, IM me later." (which I did and got no response, ever) so I'll just leave that be and move on. Newman waits for no one. I'm not mad.  I'm sure we will still be friends. Its more like I'm just shrugging and wandering off on my own way.   Tomorrow at 11am I go to the first meeting of a new set of Essentials Bible Studies. I'm kinda excited. Then I'm going to meet a classmate to study Japanese, then I have the worship service at 6pm. After that I want to go to the REC, then do some more school work. Cooltastic. Bad thing, my Aggieland Credit Union card isn't working. I freaked out the first time and checked my account online. Shoot, I had way more money in there that I thought I did. So I don't know whats going on. Thats my fun money account, so I have been using my bills money account today to get my fun stuff. Thats not cool. I'll just pay the utilities out of the fun account when it comes I suppose.

      I almost broke my Guiness glass today! I like to put my pint beer glasses in the freezer to get them nice and frosty, and the freezer door sticks. So I was getting frustrated and yanked it open and it tried to escape. Noo!! But all is well, its still in the freezer getting frosty.   Today, after my Japanese class, I go to the teacher and try to ask her when the language lab closes and if its okay to take the materials out of the language lab. Now, I'm there to learn Japanese from her, so I say it all in my best Japanese. She stares at me with this blank expression like I was speaking Swahili. Come on, now I know that I may have made some grammatical errors, but man, I also know if I said what I did to a Japanese person while I was there, they would have gotten what I was trying to say. I even asked a classmate afterwards if I was way off, and she was like "No, I got what you were trying to say." Is this what happens when you have an Iranian Japanese teacher? I love this language, but I need to be better encouraged to use it. Where are the Nihonjin in this town??

      I gained three and a half pounds since Tuesday of last week!! And I'd like to think some of that is muscle mass (cool) not all of it is (not cool). Now, I already spend 1.5-2 hours in the REC a day, so I think the problem comes with the eating habits. Too often when other people are eating pizza and ice cream and donuts, I give in and have some. This will stop. Instead of once a day having a splurge, its probably safer to have one good splurge a week. One a weird note, also on my weight training, I found that a new ab work out that I've been doing is starting to bulk my stomache too much. Like, the upper abs are starting to come over the bottom of my rib cage, and thats making me look thicker than I would like. So, I'm going to change that up again. Probably exchnge that with another twisting ab thing along with the hanging/leg raising thing.   On a happy note, I'm almost done with my last (for now) cell proliferation. Dr. Safe hasn't gotten in the new chemicals so in the meantime, I don't have to go into the lab after hours or on weekends for a bit. Yay! Maybe I'll get a chance to go visit my peoples in D/FW or Austin. I like doing the research, but sometimes... yeah, you know. Judo is going great, we are getting more women in now with the exclusively women's practice. Bob (coach) and I also got requests to assist a university in Florida to help with the movement to get women's judo NCAA status. How sweet would that be! I won't be in school when that happens, if it happens, but I'd be excited none-the-less.   Must go to work.

      I got up early, washed dishes, did some homework, got to class on time, did well on the quiz, got my Cell Bio Lab pics from last week, did my Day 2 counts and doses for cell proliferations, got to my Chem lab, bought gogles, finished quickly, worked out hard, and did judo. Yes!! I feel great.  Well, I   did  use the wrong number nine compound on day 0, but thats okay. And the ex  did  show up at the REC while I was lifting. Seeing him makes me sick to my stomach. But I ignored him with glee. And now I'm absolutely battered from the long day. But it feels good.  But other than this, I feel so good today. I think its the battered part. Something about being beat up from judo and lifting leaves me with a general sense of well being. Is that weird? That fighting leaves me feeling so great? Oh well, ta-ta!

      Anytime I look at my Japanese studies...  It still echos in my head, clear as yesterday, his words, his tone, his questions. "So what will you do now that you know this? And this? 'kekkon'? 'shiraberu'? "megane'? What will you do with this now? Will you just go home and forget?" It was as though he was challenging me to not take it the easy way, the way most people go after such a life changing experience. Those words will haunt me until I make something of all this. This can't be for nothing....

      Another week, everyday 8am to about 9pm. Between work, school, labs,  weights and judo, I don't know what to do with my spare sanity. And I'm supposed to work in dance practices soon. Something has to give.   On the lighter side, I love Japanese, I remeber this now. Not that class is particularly challenging, I hope it will become so, but I just think its such a cool language. I have to get back to there. The prof of the cancer lab is happy with my  work on the first set of cell proliferations. Yay! Its not much, but its something.   Today, I'm playing with mice in a few. Yes, its Saturday and I'm in the lab, but get this, I volunteered to help. So I'm a meccha geek, but it will do me good later on I figure. And really, I'm up in the morning way before my friends are anyways, so why not do something productive.

      Friday night, I went to a Big Lebowski party. Nevertheless, I still managed to not see the movie. Not that I'm avoiding, its just never at the right place at the right time. It was a good time. Then Marshall, Danny and I went roaming around and Marshall tried to impose himself at someone's house,  we just watched. Saturday was crazy. I got up, went into the lab, got called a geek by a PhD canidate (wow, thats something I think), worked out and saw alot of friends that had returned, showered, munched and attempted to get Ashley a b-day present. I got her a certificate to a book store, a coffee shop, and a coffee thermos and some gum. I figure thats everything she needs to just take a day or two to unwind, cause she really likes to read and drink coffee. But then my car dies. At Walmart. Once again, Marshall to the rescue. He and this random guy in the parking lot, roll my car down a hill and get it started, I didn't even know you can do that, but apparently standards are spiffy that way. So I crash it at Marshall's and we go to Ashley's dinner at Ninfa's. At the end Adam made her a super low carb cake that actually was really really tasty. Then I hung out with the friends before heading back with them to Marshall's for a party. Small, but fun/  The question of the night: which is a more important invention, wheels or pockets?   Much to my dismay, pockets won the vote. On Sunday, Marshall put water in my battery and it starts just fine. I 've learned so much about cars now. Then I go to Open House to represent   my    urlLink Judo Team .  I pissed off some taekwondo guys, which was fun. Then I went home, went to a friend from Japanese class who also has been to  urlLink Japan . We went over the homework, and told stories of places we went to. *sigh* I miss there so much. Then I studied more Japanese on my own, and went to bed.   All in all, its a good life.

      I just survived the first week of my last semester of undergraduate schooling. The last semester is supposed to be relaxing and a chance to do all the hanging out with friends you couldn't do before cause you were taking 16 hours of the hardest classes you've ever seen. And I'm only taking 10 hours. But 5 of those are lab credits. Plus I'm working 20-25 hours a week at another research lab. Everyday is running around 8-5, then there is work out and judo, and eventually dance classes. I hope I survive.  Not to complain too much. I'll probably come to love it. Beiny busy is way far better than being bored. I'm just exhausted after trying to figure out how to handle it all. Social life outside of judo and dance and the occational run in at the REC is be about nill. Tis okay, cause when me and judo people party, well, only with them do I seem to have hang overs the next day.   And to whine about work again.... I am trying to wrap up a project that the techs left open ended when they left. Now I'm only part time and doing this, doing the student worker up-keep thing, and the ordering, paper work, and other menial tech work. Well, today after Japanese class, I go in and see that we are almost out of 10x TBE, so I start to make some more. Dr. Yu comes in and is like "what are you doing? why aren't you finishing the recombinant inbred lines?" I explain we were almost out since Ping uses alot for all the agarose gels she runs. So he tells me, "No, its more important that we get the RIL scores in for final review." So I shrug, put a cover on the half finished TBE and sit at the computer to analyze some fragment band data I got from the 3100 machine. Then Dr. Yu comes back in and is like "What are you doing?" So I tell him that I'm going to start the analysis of the primer bands and he's like "No, we need more [pipette] tip boxes filled, we go through them really fast." So I'm like, okay, and stop the computer work. Later, yes, Dr. Yu comes in and is like "Kristy (yeah, he calls me that sometimes, blech), what are you doing?" "Filling the tips."  "Make sure that you get that data analyzed so that we can summarize it and compare it to the F2 data and start write ups... blah blah blah." ARGH!!!!   Other than that, my work out and diet are working wonders. I'm finally starting to get into the shape that I've always wanted. It just needed a bit of learing and discipline. I've gotten to the point where when someone says "You're getting bigger" I say "Thank you!" and smile. Well, I also know they are just talking about the arms and shoulders. Also, I really enjoy the other lab I'm doing class credit in. The people are really cool, and Sudhakar said he'll teach me Hindi if I teach him Japanese. Sweet! I've already learned Thank you (dhanya vadh), and at the cotton lab, I learned "cotton" in Chinese (mien qwa). Languages are so cool, I wish I had more time to learn more really well. And my friend Spencer is back from Mexico, he's my College Station little bro, and he's going to give me info on some good churches I can go to. Yay! And tonite is a Big Labowski party, which I have never seen before so it shall be beautiful. And, I've started dating a guy that is way cool; smart, goofy, fun, and   social  !! And he has bad ass roommates, so its never a boring time and I don't feel weird over at his place. Okay, so I have a couple dark clouds, but all in all, life is... yeah... sugoi, mecha sugoi.

      I went to the Super Walmart and now no longer have to live in the fear of starving. Or of surviving off of protein bars. I will finish the escapade at HEB tomorrow. Does hummus have protein in it, people seem to rave about pita and hummus. So much for studying, my friend from Dallas came in for the nite, so I had to hang with her and friends before the Wally World trip.   Oh, happy days. Maybe it's the smile, it really gets to me. Those eyes. ^_^   I have to take a shower, I stink. 75 mins of weights and then two hours of judo practice. I have a tournament coming up in about a week and a half. I need to drop about 3 pounds by then, easily with water weight. Shower.   .... air?!?!?!

      I want to take this time to thank Microsoft for making my life a living hell. Could they have possibly made Word any more retarded in regards to compositions that require more than just words? No, I don't want my figures on top of each other, no I don't want the picture to jump from this page to that page, no I don't my tables to randomly move around when I try to format something else. This kind of crappy programming is what you get when one company gets a monopoly.

      I just put on a pair of jeans I still have from high school, and whoa, they are loose on me. Well, they fit great actually. I remember having to put them on and stretch them out back in the day. Not so much. It's a good feeling cause even though I've gained weight the last few weeks, its still not the kinda weight I had in high school. Yippee!!  I'm still talking online to the guy that I met from Monterrey, his name is Mario. He seems really sweet, I wish I could have talked to him more before they all ran off after the party. I have another two and a half weeks before I see him again. I also have 2.5 weeks to lose the weight to get down to the 63 kilo division and get bad ass so that I don't choke again at the tourny. At practices I'm really going to concentrate on "keeping my center" like a good dancer/judoka should.   I have a major lab report to write tonite. So no team practice for me, just teach the women's class and go home. I've done some of it, but most of the writing will be tonite. The hardest part I think will be the putting the pictures into the paper. I kind of would like to write it in the two column style the most papers I read are in, but we have to follow this template that the TA gave to us. Oh well, the calculations aren't hard, this will just be tedious.   My nails are growing out, yippee! I must be healthy these days cause on thursdays I will cut the nails down to nothing for Judo and the next tuesday, they will be nearly longer than normal. Its been a while, well, just over a week, since i tore them way down, and now I can tap them on the table. Sad because I know that I will have to cut them down again next Tuesday. *sigh* I'll enjoy them until then. Just nice to see that they actually do grow when I'm eating right and stuff.   I have a pimple in the middle of my cheek. I never get pimples in the middle of cheeks, forehead, chin. I dunno what that deal with that is. They are usually along where I rest my head in my hand or between eye brows and around nose. The "T" zone thing, where I get super oily. My face get super oily and my hands will be cracking from being so dry.   OKay, time to go to work.

      Its been two weeks since Go Shibata Judo Tourny, and I haven't said a thing. School sucks majorly, I only have time at night to study and its really hard cause I always feel exhausted. The week after my tournament I got my chem test grade back, yeah, I failed. I only seem to be doing good in Japanese, and that because I've already learned all this stuff before. I'm afraid to tell the rents cause I think they will tell me to give up dance or judo to focus more on school, and that would just make me depressed.   So I also didn't tell you that I met a really cool guy after the judo tournament. He asked for my email address, and I really didn't expect him to remember it and contact me cause he just remembered, didn't write it down. But then, Monday morning, there is a message from him in my inbox. Whoo-hoo! I see that he has hotmail too so I put him on my buddy list just out of curiousity and go to work. That day I skipped class to go to Walmart and eat at home, and there was a message from him on my screen! Yippee! But he was offline so I couldn't send anything back. When I got hom that evening, he was on and had sent me another message! Goodness!  He has tried to contact me more in one day than that other guy does in a week.   So we've been able to chat online almost everyday since then. Last weekend I went to Dallas, and I've been busy this week so we miss each other online alot. But at anyrate, he seems so sweet. I don't get to see him again until Nov. 8 at the Houston Open Judo Tournament. Oh, did I mention that he lives in Monterrey, Mexico?  Nope, I didn't. So yeah, that would happen to me. So in the meantime I figure I can brush up on some long forgotten Spanish and see what happens.   Last weekend I got to go to Dallas, so fun. I got to see my little bro, who was there for the UT/OU game. I partied with him and the Longhorn Singers, pretty cool. I stayed with Hedish, she came with me to the party and we also went on shopping fun times. Then we went out to visit my friend Tommy who is in med school at UT Southwestern now. Everyone seems to be doing well there, and it was great to see them all. I don't get to leave CS very often.   Ja, that all for now.

      Yesterday was my tournament, and as I seem to do at every competition, I choke. I won the first, then lost the next two. Blast. But it was fun none the less. We were there from 7:40 am to 10:20 pm, the turn out was probably around 250 competitors, tons of little kids, so the seniors division didn't even get started until around 4pm. The team from Monterrey was there, and they were hot! Me and the other ladies spent our time staring and gawking and such. ^_^  So afterwards we go out to Northgate, and it was this big ordeal trying to get everyone together. Jackie and I decided to meet t Fitzwilly's because there is more space there, but when I get there, Bob takes everyone to Mad Hatters, and the UT people aren't even there yet. Mad Hatter's is ridiculously crowded and we move down to Shadow Canyon, which was dead. In between there the UT peeps joined us. So it was A&M, UT, ULL (Louisianna) and Monterrey. WE pretty much filled the place up. Then Bob got 3-5 dollars from everyone, and we bought tons of beer, loaded it in my trunk and went back to his place.   Yeah, so I was out until about 5 and then got to bed around 5:30. If you want stories about the Mexico boys, or my constant fighting with Theo or other things, you'll have to ask me.

      Saturday is Go Shibata, the huge judo tournament we host here at Texas A&M. Looks like we are going to be hosting around 250 competitors. I will be fighting in the 138lb, Women's Senior (brown and black belt) division. Wish me luck, I'm already nervous as all hell.   I can't beleive I had a test today, this morning seems like forever ago. Of course, I went to bed around 2am, woke up at 5am to continue studying. That always makes the day longer. Then I listened to the melodious voices of Ketsu Meishi. Warui shiken ga aru nichi, shiken no ato, ketsu meishi wo kiite, ureshiku naru.    Kathy and I finally tried to clip mice tails for genotyping today. What an ordeal. We have to be able to tell these mice apart, so Kelcey always put notches in the ears. She would use this hole punch devide, and when we went to use it today, man, it was traumatic. The mice squealed and wiggled. And I'm just not that good at the scruff hold yet. They are so tiny and they bunch up so I can't get the neck skin. So we couldn't get the notched and we decided to try the mouse with the weird tail. Well, we have to clip a bit of the tail off and the scissors weren't as sharp as we thought. So that was an ordeal too. Goodness.   I was talking to a friend after practice today, and he was talking about his girlfriend, and how he is dead set she is the one. He has the proposal worked out and everything. He's so happy to be with her. And I was like "Man, I miss that. That feeling." And he said that God has a person for each of us, and He won't let us just wander around alone forever. A good, Godly man. And these things have been running through my mind alot. Yeah, thats something I would like... a good, Christian man. It's just... hard in this day and age to find one. One thats not already taken.   The search will continue.

      So after a streak of going to competitions and CHOKING I finally began to break through my mental blocks. My first match I did the same bone headed things as before; reaching, leaning too much, throwing myself down. So needless to say, I lost. My second match though, I got some good stuff in, got a wazari on a throw, then pinned the girl for ippon. She actually got me in an arm-bar, but since my arms are double jointed, I just sat there as she bent it backwards. Yippee! So then I had a third match, but against the same girl from match one. She beats me all the time, so that's another block that I need to work through. She got me on the ground, her mat work is a force to be reckoned with. But yay, I got a non-bitch medal.   I wish Monterey had gone, that would have been bad A..... zannen. *sigh*

      So I moved back to Houston, back in with my mother. Yipeee. Let me explain why I would do this. I'm hoping to go to Japan in the JET program, and I won't hear until early February if I get an interview for a position. Lets say I get in, then I will be leaving July 25th for Japan, and its kinda silly to try and find an apartment, in Houston, for 6-7 months. Too expensive. Now, if I get rejected in some point along the way, I ideally will have a job, and will move out to my own place. I'm sure they have efficiencies in Houston. That's all I want I've decided. I like having my own place, no roomies, and not having to have a bunch of junk furniture to fill it up. All I need is my bed, and my crime lab. Moving on.   Last nite, I went out with a group of friends that I have been able to keep in touch with since high school. I love these guys. Anytime we are in Houston over the past four years, we got together to hang out. Every time we get together, its like great. Well, last nite we tried to go to a club/bar called The Red Door. The word is that the place is racist, and doesn't particularly like Asians. They must be crazy. ^_^  Anyways, so they made sure they were all dressed spiffy and so there was no fault with dress code, but we couldn't get in anyways. Why? They picked a white guy with us saying that his jeans were too baggy. Jeans are borderline to begin with at this place, *sigh*. So my new dancin' pants were taken to a bar down the street called Woodrow's, that looked like every other bar in College Station. So much for the big city life. But it was a blast anyways, cause we all got our drinks and stood around the bar thing and talked and laughed our asses off. It was great, they are so much fun.   Then afterwards, in true late nite style, we went to a Denny's and had breakfast at 3am. Denny's is not known for their service. I said Taco Cabana, cause that's the style that I like to go out in. There was one down the road, but others must not be aware of the significance of the TC. Anyways, we ate, left and hung out in front of one of their houses for a while and went home. It was a great time, these guys are great.

      I'm getting lazy. I need to study. I need to watch what I eat. I need to work on my Japanese. I need to do more cardio workout. I need to finish my resume and print it out on nice paper. I need to start researching jobs. Ugh. But I guess that's what they call senoritis. This semester has me run down in a major way. It was a mad dash from the start of September to now, barely any free space to breath in. Now that the air around me starts to clear and I am seeing what's ahead, man, I need a breather.   HAaaiiiiiii--YAH!!  Sorry, that happens....  Have I even mentioned that I learn more in my one hour Japanese/English sessions with Junichi than I have learned all semester in the Japanese class that I am taking? Yeah, its a good time. Japanese is a beautiful language. I want to be peta-peta some day.   So, last nite I went with the judo peeps to a party. Of course, given that I'm still somewhat shaken that I can't remember two hours of Friday night last weekend, I keep tight control of my alcohol intake. I went home around three in the morn, cause I had to work today. But apparently, my boys got into a fight cause they were accused of keying some dude's car. Four of my guys against nine of some other people, and my boys wailed on them from what I hear. Hahahahaha!! You don't mess with a   JUDO TEAM !!   Man, I did something retarded to my back and its starting to act up again. For a while it was acting like it was getting better and now, damn! I bet its those stupid reverse crunches I did. The thing is, nothing in particular makes it hurt worse (maybe leaning forward) than anything else. I'm even doing my pull ups and rows and nothing. It just generally hurts 24/7. This is bad, I need to get it checked out.   My kitchen is in splendid squalor. My sinks have never been so full of crap. I blame sushi. I made sushi for the judo pot luck, and that takes a lot of things to prepare it. Plus, I was in a hurry, cause I started out with the wrong rice and had to do rice all over again. Sooo. by the time I was done I was nearly an hour late to the dinner and left everything out and yeah. I'm retarded. Then we weekend was crazy all over the place so I was barely ever home. *sigh* I'll get to it prolly this weekend when I have nothing better to do but clean or study.   Well, I'm waiting for a friend to call me back. She was in the middle of something when I called I think, so I'm not sure if I'll hear from her. I'm gonna go now. Got another long day ahead of me tomorrow. (Dead days my ass!!)

      So I clicked on this link from someone's website and it ended up putting a virus on my AIM Profile. I think its taken care of now, but grrr. Now my Mom's profile has it and I'm going to have to go home to take care of it. I think she'll freak out if I have her do it herself.   I still have a broom and dustpan from this guy. Maybe I'll just dump it at his place. Blah.   Good stuff!! No tests this week! Not until next Monday, when I have both. In the mean time I need to become a badass in Analytical Chemistry. I can do that, I'll be at the library in the evenings all week. But I also need to stay inshape in the abscence of judo practice, so you can also find me at the REC prolly from 5-7, 7:30 every evening.  After next Monday, my undergraduate career is over (for now). Yeah, for now. I'm toying with the idea of going to get another one somewhere else.   I hope they got my JET Application in DC. I'm on pins and needles, eeep!!  I saw THE LAST SAMARAI last weekend, and oh my word, SO GOOD!!! My friends and I wanted to go fight people in a feild in big skirt/pants. It was so beautiful, the music, the camera shots, everything was awesome. And then the ninja's, whoa!! I was all worked up for the rest of the night. And the next day. Shoot, I still am. Judo kinda did that to me, I was never this... aggresive?... before I started that. Shoot, I was a ballerina, I  did not  want to do judo. Oh well, c'est la vie. ^_^  Okay, I have to get to work now. Tata.

      I can feel it all slipping away. I want to hold on, but thats like squeezing clay, the harder you hold the more squeezes out. So on the 20th of this month, I'll be walking across a stage and walking out of the undergraduate life forever. The life has been stressful, but the rewards have so greatly outweighted the costs for me, I'm just not ready to give it up. Dance, classes, judo, the lifestyle~~ Walking through trees in the middle of campus, around other people like me, young adults with all this passion and vision.   The life I made for myself here is exactly what I want. Now that I have it, I have to give it up. All my hard work to create an environment around me that I'm truly grateful for, and then they are like "Congratulations, you get to leave it all behind!" I cherish the way things are now. I'm not much liking it that people are like "Welcome to the real world." What the hell is the real world? Like I'm not actually on Earth right now?People make it sound like I have to pack my bag and get ready for a rough time. I bet no one living in the "real world" could make it living the life I led this semester. The leaving the home at 7:30 am and getting home at 10pm, the late hours pouring over books and notes, the responsibitlites not just to attending bills and work, but to classes, organizations, and what ever else there it.   So now I'm expected to go out into the corporate world, get a job, pay bills, and make a living with my degree. Shoot, I just turned in an application to go teach English in Japan.   But man, i'm talking to my friend, Tommy, online. He's great, in the course of writing this, he's made me feel better. I"ll talk to you chumps laters. ^_^

      I finally called the JET office last week, and yes, they do have my application. When I got back from College Station, the notice of my application was waiting for me. Yay! So now I have to wait for an offer of an interview. From things I've heard, if you've been to Japan before, you are a shoe in. They don't have to worry about you getting there and freaking out, having extreme culture shock or getting really depressed. It shows you are independent and have studied the language enough to survive at least. So I'm feeling pretty confident.   Cool news. My soon to be boss, Dr. Safe, was in Japan. Just so happens he went to Kyoto University for a series of talks which were hosted by Dr. Matsui. For those who don't know, Dr. Matsui was the prof at Kyo-Dai that took me in for a brief internship stint. At that time, neither of them knew of the other one, though they were in the same line of research. When Dr. Safe had dinner with Dr. Matsui, Matsui mentioned me! He remembered me! Yay! Small world, ne?   I am working on securing this job at IBT in the med center under Dr. Safe. Luckily, he spoke highly of my abilities with cells and Mrs. Safe spoke highly of my people skills, so I will be doing experiments and also doing personal relations with sales people, techs, and possible labs at MD Anderson as clinical trials come closer to starting.    I'm back into the lifting, new routine, new diet (high protein, of course) and now have a log to write this all down in and keep track. The more excesizes I rotate between, I tend to forget what weight I do and thats just no good. It also forces me to write down and track all that I eat. Which, cause of my lazy nature, if there is no easily accessible nutrition info on something, I won't eat it. So thats helpful in a way. ^_^   I'm also on steriods and muscle relaxers for my back. Damn thing. Of course, I was smart and tried to do judo last Thursday. Not a good idea. I'm feeling better, so something of my medication cocktail is working. Doctor said I should feel much much better by tomorrow. We'll see. I don't want to go back until I get on my own medical policy.   I think thats enough talking for now.

      That last entry made me sound like I'm just all broken up about being single or something. As though I sit and think and pine for a guy. Yeah, I think about them, but you know, I'm just as happy single.   Something that happened about a week or two ago. I went into Kroger's, and an entire section and whole wall was dedicated to Valentine's Day stuff. And I kinda freaked out, thinking "Thats Feburary 14th! Thats less than a month away!" Then a wave of relief came over me as I realized that means nothing. I don't have to plan anything, I don't have to buy anything, I don't have to worry about the who, what, when, where, and how of it all. Its just another day for me. And that realization, contrary to the emotions of most girls I've come in contact with, made me happy. It made me smile and feel lighter. Ha!   I feel more like myself this past semester and this part of the new year than I have for the past three and a half years before that. I really like this. I don't have to answer to anyone, I can do what I want, when I want to, and how I want to, with who I want to. I can do something silly, maybe even dumb, and I don't have to worry about being judged. Cause for the 3.5 years that guy ruled my life, thats how I felt. I realized that living like I need to constantly "look forward" and "play it safe" made me.. well.. high strung.   I'm ready to get my own apartment again. I've already done internet searches for cheap one bedrooms and efficiencies in Houston. I just need to secure this job so that I can make a move on that. In the meantime, more research into PhD's and International Studies BA's and Japanese Universities. I"m really on a roll for all of that. Found interesting options. Can't wait. ^_^ Its all such an adventure.

      I should really be more careful about the guys I fall for.   Nothing in particular that happened today, in fact, nothing in particular that happened this month. Just things I have been thinking about. I also notice that I'm more prone to write in these things at night, especially if its cold outside. I think that combo makes me somewhat.... melancholic. If I had been drinking, it would only be worse. Alcohol only makes me a)inhibition-less or b) introspective. Moving on.  Butter scotch. Yum. Yay.

      I've started looking for graduate schools I want to go to. So far I have checked out programs at UC Berkeley, UCLA, and MSU. I have also found a listing of Japanese graduate programs that offer advanced degrees in various Biological Sciences in English. Perhaps a bit silly seeing as I could do that here, but hey,  its not in America!  I need to look at other places, obviously, in Japan, but many of the lists I found were in Japanese, and that's just a lot of kanji.   I hope I get a job in the Medical Center cause then I can go to a continued education class at Rice for Japanese, and after that I'll be right there to meet up with friends at bars or restraunts. Its just one of my favorite areas of town. Hopefully there are some good gyms and a judo club near there too. I need to fight. Must get it out of my system. I'm starting to day dream about throwing people around and that can't be good for anyone.

      .... which is  hard thing to do when nothing is set in stone. I will be going to the med center and the woodlands to hand out resumes to various research companies. Once I get a job I will be able to secure a better schedule. I'm trying to get back into the work out regimine, which is doing well, but without structure in the rest of the day, i find myself prone to snacking which is completely counter productive to the sprints i have been doing. Bah!  I still haven't received that note saying that they got my application (JET). Pins and needles. I want that so bad.....  Men, sheesh.   Well, the holidays treated me well, hung out with my boys almost every other nite. T'was grand. Thats why I haven't written much, time spent here now was the time i spent with them. Many of them have now returned to their respective schools. It used to be so sad, it still is sad to see them all go, but i no longer worry about losing contact with them, cause we've held up so well for the past 4 and a half years.   Sprints, i hope they work this time like they did last time. I think i will up the intensity Wednesday, I'm doing six laps now, and I think i can push more. I'll try jogging curves instead of walking them. We'll see. This will be good for me mentally too.   Okay, ready to sleep. Each night brings me one day closer to finding out about Japan.

      Its shocking to me still that already over two months have gone by since I graduated. I have a job, I've been offered a chance at a pretty sweet graduate school deal, and I've met some great people. Sure, I may have been rejected from JET, but things are showing themselves for what I'm supposed to do I think. Does that make sense?   I finally have the beginings of a project. I'm to do a series of WST assays on my cells and several other cell lines treated with these chemicals and then in conjunction with some various receptor/enzyme inhibitors to try to determine the mechnism through which these chemicals are working. So I'm pretty psyched, I want to be busy again. I don't like coming home and spending almost 2 hours in front of the TV before I go work out, then only having to talk on the computer before going to bed. I like having enough to do that I have to  find  time to chat online and update this thing. I thought the life of a 8-5 job would be great, but its driving me nuts. I  need  to get back to graduate school.   Anyways, so Dr. Safe hasn't had a chance to write down exactly the direction/project he wants me to go to. But this is a start. And I'll be following along the lines of Jun and Qin with the westerns only on my cell line and starting with looking at these various protein expression levels. I'm kind of worried about the westerns cause I live so far from the lab and it will be a pain to go back in for the 12 hour treatment time point. I need to get a place near there. May, thats my deadline, cause thats when my 24 Hour membership is up. So in May I move and find a new gym. If I can't travel the world, I can travel the gym scene.   But as for the week. My back is slowly feeling better. Maybe I'll be able to fight by the middle or the end of March? I miss fighting. I'll need to change my schedule to work in judo. OH goodness, if I move to southwest Houston, where will I fight, I've been planning on going to Diamondback this whole time.   I miss studying languages. I want to get back into Japanese (obviously), and I want to either pick back up on Mandarin or Spanish. Both would be very useful, considering the state I live in and the feild of study I'm in. This is my second job in a row where I'm the only native English speaker. I need to check out cost of classes in these various languages, and that will determine which language(s) I'll work on. Preferable Japanese and one other.   Weights are going good, as always. I've gotten significantly more picky as to what I consider "Eye Candy" since last weekend. ^_^ And the others that I consider still qualified for the title haven't been around at the same time I'm there. Hey, I can be picky! I'm not in any rush to get with someone.   I needed to tell Ashely something, and I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Argh!   OKay, later.

      So life in Houston after JET rejection keeps getting better and better, though at times ironic. First, the job is great. Though I don't have much to do, and every time my professor talks to me it seems he's changed the direction he wants me to go, its all good. People assure me that once he has a chance to sit down and go over exactly where and what he wants me to do, I'll have more than enough things to do. Good. I can't wait to be busy again.   But another thing! His wife, Lorena, said that they are hesitant to put me on salary cause they would like to see me sign on with them as a graduate student. Apparently, he really likes the work I do and thinks I'm really good. Which kind of makes me nervous cause I haven't done all that much so I'm not sure what he is basing this off of. ^_^ Anyways, she says I could prolly get my PhD with them in 3-4 years (normally, short is 4.5 years) and that I could sign on now, that way the 1-1.5 year I would have used as a lab tech puts me almost half way through my PhD program! I mean, whoa! Plus, she said I could get paid the same as I would as a lab tech, and in the medical center, I can take classes from Baylor, MD Anderson, UT, or any other grad program here, not just A&M. These are top researchers we are talking about!   Plus, they know I really wanted to go out of the country, but she was saying that Dr Safe has contacts all over the world, and certainly in Japan. If I get my doctorate with them, I can pretty much go anywhere I want. Places she mentioned that were kind of a given were Japan, Korea, England and Germany. !!!!!!! o_O  !!!!!!!! New course of action. Perhaps get my PhD here in Houston (its not so bad after all, the cost of living is really low), and travel the world as a Post-doc  and research scientist. Hmm? Whatcha think? I love it!  My MCF-7 breast cancer cells are finally growing!! Yesterday I looked at them (A third attempt at growing them) and most of the cells were floating. Today I just looked at them and the little plate I used is PACKED! WHAT?!?! Maybe I looked at them funny yesterday, it makes no sense. Anyways, yay! I can start my proliferations on them this Sunday.   Well, life seems peachy, why does the title say bittersweet? Well, as for personal life, yeah. Life presents me some great guy that I get to know and start to like, only to send him away to a far away place. One: This guy I don't feel like talking about. He'll be gone soon. Bah.   Then there is the guy from Mexico I met in October at the Go Shibata Judo tournament. We clicked really well, and then he had to go back to Mexico. He didn't get to come to Houston for another tournament, and I kind of wrote him off. Well, he came back in recently, and we still clicked really well. Those that know us, you know..... So we are retarded around each other, then again, he is swept away back to Mexico.   THEN, yes again, I met this great guy at the gym, one of the "eye candy" boys I talk about. We talked briefly at the gym one day, set a "date" to work out together the next, hung out afterwards that night, then when I got back in town Sunday, we hung out again. He is, well, exactly what I tell people I like in a guy. Health conscience, hard working, determined, sense of adventure, very smart, nice, sense of humour, sense of balance in life, and  he likes me!  Well, this one lives in Seattle, I don't know why I'm still surprised when these things happen.   There must be something inherent in these types of guys, the ones that like to travel and move around a lot, and it catches my attention somehow. My being the type to hate being in one place for too long as well. I'm glad I know these guys, time with them is good, something to look back and smile upon. I always think, if you have a chance to be happy, even for a moment, why would you pass that up?   Okay, back to work, must passage my breast cells. ^_^

      I'm thinking I won't move until my 24 hour fitness membership is up. Since I am only enrolled at the one near my mom's house, and considering I paid good money for that, I won't leave until about May. That should work better, gives me a few months of getting paid and just pocketing the money for savings and such. Salary issue still isn't set. Oh well, we'll see. There are tons of cheap apartments around Houston I am finding. I found one place about 400 sq ft and only $250 a month. That's still bigger than where I lived in College Station for nearly $400 a month.  I bet its ghetto, but that's why I train. ^_^  So very much to explore in Houston. I want a buddy that works in the medical center or downtown so that I have someone to explore with. I just walked around by myself the other day, the weather was gorgeous. Parts of downtown remind me of Austin, parts of San Fran, and parts of Kyoto. Speaking of which, I need to go play in Austin again sometime soon.   Currently at work, the tissue culture hood is cleaned out to be certified or something today. Blast, I'm supposed to be dosing some cells and changing media on others... and I don't know when these certify-ing people will be around. In the meantime, its a day 0 absorbence reading for my MDA cells. OH wait, I need the hood to transfer media for that too.... BLAST!!   Valentines Day sucked. Not because I don't have a boyfriend, that doesn't bother me in the least, but I went to the gym and hurt my back worse. Its so weird what hurts it. This time, I was doing push-ups where you put your feet on those yoga/balance balls, and something about catching my balance between the push-ups made something in my back go "HEY!" and I fell over pretty much. I gave up on that to try to do the stair master, but that brought tears to my eyes. TEARS! Newman doesn't cry, I just leak sometimes. So I hobbled to my car, and went home. I spent V-day laid up on a couch. Gibble.   Sunday, of course, I passed on the gym. But then, I felt like a goober, so I had to go back yesterday. Its an addiction. Like crack, I have to do more and more just to feel normal. Then when I don't get my work out "hit", I feel terrible. And since I can't fight these days, weights are absolutely necessary to give me that "I want to melt, I'm so tired" feeling. At least its not EtOH or something illegal ^_^   Okay, there are papers for me to read. I'm outta heeyahhh.... (cause I'm DOUG!)

      Its been 24 hours since I learned of my rejection from JET. Mom says I should call them to find out what they didn't like about my application so that I can better evaluate whether I should try to apply again next year. I'm still reorganizing my head and re-prioritize my goals. Maybe this can be for the better. Now I can really get into my research and if I kick my ass, could I possibly get some publications with my name on them?? That would be prime for getting into a grad program in Japan. The PhD programs that I have found in Japan that have the most leniency for international students say that you need either a master's degree or two years research experience after obtaining the bachelor's degree. And if you have papers with your name, that time can be shortened. So that's the route that's top in my head right now.   Dr. Kristin Newman, PhD. Yeah, that's sounds real nice.   I'm going to start getting info on apartments in the Medical District area. I found an efficiency for $320-350 a month, 455 square feet. My last place was 320 square feet, and I loved it. So this would be great. I think the higher price is if you want one that has the attached screened in porch/greenhouse. I think I just might be willing to pay for that. How nice would it be to be able to have a little area to have a table and chairs and sit in the rain or at night to read or something. On the bus route, which I've decided is great. Near the Bellaire area, which is nice considering that I love to shop at the Hong Kong Mall. I will look to move in after my 24 Hour Eye Candy pass is up.   Of course, I'll still keep my eyes open for a better paying job now. If they go ahead and give me what I was first quoted (they had better) I will probably be picky as to what new job I would take. Cause I really like the cancer research that's going on in the Safe lab, so I would only give it up for a cool topic and a better salary offer.   Now that I will be here for at least another year, I'm starting to think about this fitness competition think. I wonder how hard it is to get into and what my chances are of doing well..... I' need more info.   New fav song, IN YOUR EYES by Peter Gabriel.

      JET rejected me. Fuck. My mom tells me that maybe its because finances are so tight these days and there just isn't the money to probably hire as many people, especially in education. So they probably are looking to take in people with more teaching experience. Never the less, it still makes me feel like a failure of sorts. And I will still apply to graduate school there, maybe even apply to the JET program again, but it makes my confidence feel about nil. If they don't see me fit to tutor/teach my own native language, would anyone see me fit to do research for them? *sigh*  Then the METRO bus system here in Houston was a pain in the arse. Apparently, I live in zone 3, so I have to pay a bit more to get to zone 1 (where the med center is) but somehow, on the way into town, we go through a zone 4 (even more pricey) where I'm supposed to change buses. So they are like, no if this is the route you want to take, you need to pay more. The easiest route that doesn't take me through zone 4 make me walk 4 blocks to the light rail, then 3 blocks from the light rail to another bus stop. Yeah, the spring weather isn't going to let me do that. Shoot.   Then there is the job. I'm going to like the work, its cancer research! The people are cool and friendly. The professor is great. The medical center is an awesome place. BUT, it seems like everytime salary is brought up, it gets lower and lower. I emailed the last person who quoted me the lowest and was like "Mrs. Safe quote to me this, and its important to me that I get that, especially since I"ll have to pay my own insurance for a while." Grrrr.  Good things still though. The medical center and downtown Houston has so many places that need to be explored. The have jazz cafes to oriental lounges. Bars and restraunts galore. So I will have to explore on Fridays after work or something. Plus, there is really nothing on the light rail that checks whether you have a pass or not, so people could really just hop on and off. There are no turn stall or things where you have to put in a ticket. Its odd. I guess they will put something in later, but in the meantime.... come on down'.   The two hours I work out will still be my two hours of bliss in an otherwise bleak day. I kick my ass and stare at the guys. I need to learn how to smile at people. Why am I too scared to even smile at a cute guy?? Shoot, its just a smile. Maybe if I looked friendlier they might come and talk to me. Cause I know I'm way too shy (stupi, stupid, stupid...) to say anything to them. Ja. oh well.   I'mma get to bed. need to get up to figure out how to get to the Metro financial department tomorrow. Baibai.

      The diet is slowly working. I"m not being as strict as I was before about my protein/sugars ratio, plus I'm not fighting, so I can't expect to lose weight as fast as before. But slow and steady, I'll be sexy by the judo tourny. That's what matters cause that's where the eye candy is. Hehehe. Started working out at 24 Hour Fitness, and its a cornucopia of eye candy. Although, as I said before, Houston is full of cute Asian guys, who have cute Asian girlfriends. I'm in the right city for some oogling, but not so much if I want to get my hands on one of them. ^_^   Have decided to start the job anyways. Anyways? Well, they are offering me less money than my step bro makes (I don't know if he works full time, mind you) and he doesn't have a degree. This is cancer research, people. Blast be to A&M. But since it is cancer research, a fascinating topic, I must say, I will deal with that, live with the mother, and this will keep me from feeling too bad if I ditch them for the JET program. I hear that JET pays better as far as yearly salary goes.   I kinda miss having someone to go out of my way for.   But on the other hand, I've got plenty on my plate to deal with and keep me occupied. I'm rekindling my love of reading (never really had time to do that much as an undergrad). Getting back to the weights. Focusing on my plans and goals in this country and Japan. I'm getting back to the basics, I'm really getting back to myself. So all in all, life is grand. ^_^

      I did not go to the gym. I went out to dinner with Daniel, friend from A&M judo. We hung out at Chili's until they kicked us out at 1am. We made a mess. I like making messes. I bet our waiter hated us, we could feel the "get a clue and leave" vibes coming from him.   Saturday Madre and I went to Austin to see my lil' bro sing in the Longhorn Choir. First we went out to lunch at Trudy's which is near where my bro lives. I stuffed myself with fajitas and took a nap at the hotel. The show was much much fun! There are some amazing voices in that group! Of course, my bro was the best.   Afterwards, he took me to the after party. At first, while everyone was sober, I rather bored. Think, they all knew each other and had all their inside jokes, and then there is me, the sister of one of the guys, and a painfully shy sister at that. So I sat around drinking the Punch o' Death. I drank two glasses of Punch o' Death before I started to feel it, then they decided to sing the Texas Sip Fight Song, which I decided to participate in. That was slightly painful. Then they put me in the middle of a big circle and sang the satire of the Aggie Way Hymn. I just stood there with my thumb in place. Thanks and gig'em.   Afterwards, I was quite toasty, and you know when you are toasty, nothing is scary except losing your toasty-ness. So i had yet a fourth glass, and possibly a fifth? I don't really know. Well, in the process, I met a cool guy named Adam, a cool guy named Sean, a cooler guy named Cesar (sp?), another cool guy named Johnny, and a super spiffy guy named Matt who I had a nice conversation with in Japanese. Yay! Apparently he thinks I speak okay, he understood me fine and *gasp* I understood him. I think that I am better at the whole forgein language thing when I have had a little EtOH in me cause it lowers my inhibitions and my fears of not being perfect.   Well, then Clark dragged me home and I puked.   The next day I went back to the hotel and I puked.   We tried to go to lunch, I went to the bathroom and I puked.   I slept in the backseat on the way home.   I had to go into work, I went in for three hours. I felt like crap. But it had to be done. But the good news is that my results are turning out nice. So yay.   Monday I had to take the GRE. You know what, my head still hurt and my hands were shaking the entire day. Ugh!! I went to the testing place and FORGOT MY ID. So I get to go home, fiddle around, grab my ID and go back to take the test at 3pm. It took me about three hours to do. Sutpid essays and verbal. I think my quantitative score was a good 100 points higher than my verbal. This is why I'm in science. But I made a score high enough to get in, and higher than what Dr. Safe requested for a training grant he can sign me up for. So all is good. IT OVER WITH!   But the repercussions.....  I had to go into work after the test. Two reasons, I had to freeze down some cells so that I have a stock of the established cell lines in case I get contamination. Also, I got out of the test around rush hour, and there is no way in hell that I was going to sit on the high way from UH to my madre's place. So I go into the lab from around 6-8pm. Yipee. I get much stuff done though, so its nice. I grap Chipotle on the way home since I hadn't eaten since noon that day, eat, chill, and pass out around 10:30.     Current Events   Work was a mess. There is so much to take care of before the end of the month, since one of our grants ends then. I spent most of the day in front of the computer or on the phone placing orders at the last minute. I did score the lab a pizza voucher and six free insulated mugs though! That makes it worth while! Yay! But my desk and bench area are covered in papers, notes, invoices, packing slips, protocols, and various other things.   Going to North Carolina isn't looking good. The weekend that Man wanted me to go, well, the tickets are around $400, and I just can't fit that into my budget, especially with trying to move out in May. He is going to see if his leaving dates are flexible, so that maybe I can go up the weekend after or he will come to Houston to play. I kinda don't want him to come into here until I have a place of my own. "Yeah, lets watch a movie at my MOM"S PLACE". No, not cool.   Speaking of finding a place to live, the Medical Center place didn't work out. its TINY for that money AND there is nowhere to park a car. I would have to pay for a spot somewhere. NO good. Back to the drawing board.   I need to talk to Dr. Gimble about the letters of recommendation. I might not need them, it looks like I don't. We'll see.   I saw Hotness today at the gym again. He's hot. But I'm a pansy. He comes around and suddenly the ground is really interesting. Ooh, look! Specks! He doesn't work out long enough.... only does about four things before he leaves I think. I don't even have time to build up the courage to look at him. DAMN THE MAN!!  I have named him Hotness, and he will be mine. (duht!)  Okay, toodles!

      I saw Hotness at the gym for a breif minute while I was on the cardio machines, doing my warm up. He should stick around more, if for no reason other than to give me something to look at. Oh well.   I found an apartment complex right in the middle of the Medical Center. For a small efficiency, 350 square feet, its $610 a month.  urlLink Check it out!  All bills except phone paid, but I have my cell phone. There is a gym, so that saves me the cost of a membership (if its decent enough). I can walk to work, that saves me the cost of a bus pass. I hope they have internet, being right in the middle of the medical center, you would think they would have the ethernet the rest of the center has. That would save me too. Even so, I would prolly get a local bus pass so that I can take the Metro Rail and local buses to downtown, grocery stores, restraunts, and the like. Parking would be an extra cost, I don't know what I would do about that. I'm going to go during lunch to check it out today.   Not much new to talk about. I have alot of work today it may seem so I should get started. Nothing on the NYTimes is really stirring up the passions today. I need some new cds for working to. I'm gonna go now. Baibai.

        "Under God" Issue Arises Again   Check out the article on  urlLink NY Times  for yourself. As you all probably know, yes I am a Christian, but I'm also a conservative in the purest sense of the term. As in, I beleive in a small, unmeddling government. I don't think government should have any say in religious and personal affairs, apart from protection and sustaining general harmony. I also did not realize that "Under God" was added to the pledge in the late 50's. Of course, it doesn't bother me in the least, but if it really pains some people to hear/say it, what harm can it do to take it out of gavernment establishments. There are places and times for worship and announcing your faith. I'm all for Christian apologetics and sticking to your beleifs and sharing them, but not in the least about forcing others to act as though they are a part of it. So there be it.     GRE Woes   I took two online practive GRE things, one I hurried through (I was at work) and didn't do too well. Go figure. Then I took my time on the second one, and I did much much better. Wow, thinking things through is a good idea, I guess. Well, never the less, math is a joke, but the words, DAMN THE WORDS!!! I haven't taken an English class since high school, and man, it shows. My vocabulary has dimished terribly. I look at this list of words to study, and I see words that I know I knew at one time, but now I'm like, huh? I even used to use words like that on a daily basis. This weekend, words and more words.     More News   I'm reading the NY Times in the morning to work on my vocab and reading skills, yay me. But here, this is sickening.  urlLink Israel's Use of Children .  They are arming kids, barely even teenagers, with bombs and sending them over to do suicide bombings. The parents don't even know about this!! Did the kid with the bag even know he was on a death trip? Are these kids threatened with their life do it by some Palestine faction? This is just insane, why??  And now comments on the  urlLink Evil Empire of Microsoft . Man, if you read this, I know you work for them, and I'm sorry I have to say this, but yeah. There are entire books on the not quite legal but not illegal ways in which Microsoft does its business, how it blocks smaller competitors' innovation, forces its OS and software onto new PCs and all that jazz. And frankly, its just buggy stuff. It doesn't help my point of view that my dad also used to work for Sun Mircosystems, the home of java and Linux with systems that don't require constant rebooting. ^_^ Microsoft is squirrelly and we all know how I feel about squirrels.   On a side note, I think that all names of British origin have the stress on the first syllabul. Most forgein derived names that have been "American-ized" are the same way. Hmmm....  So people are scoffing at the Human Genome Project simply because we aren't seeing some surge of drugs come out of these companies and institutions? Please. These things take time. So what if we know the sequence of all those chromosomes, still still don't know exactly where all the genes are, what they do, and how they are controlled. And there is the whole new world of  urlLink epi-genetics  is taking form, making things much more complicated as far as our controlling of things. But really, its all a very beautiful system going on in our cells, don't get me started.   Thats about all I have for you guys right now. Take care, later!

      Screw "Return of the King", Hedish is back and writing again!!     Spring Break!   Okay, so technically it wasn't MY spring break, but it rocked anyways. FIRST, I got a group of people together to go to the Rice Village for St. Patrick's day. I felt that it was my duty, as an Irish-American decendent, to do this. It was so crowded, I really did not expect that, and so once we found a place to sit, at Little Woodrow's, we didn't move. They kept running out of green beer, I dunno why they couldn't have just used food coloring for this stuff. Next time, not only will I bring a flask perhaps, but i will bring green food dye for my friends.   Then on Friday I dragged some friends down to south-east Houston for some salsa dancing at Rumba Club. It just so happens that the night we went was the night of a regional salsa competition. There were some GOOD dancers there, and none of the younger ones wasted their time on me. Hehehe, its okay, so I danced with older men who were patient with me and teaching, it was so much fun. The nice feeling about that place is that people weren't there to pick each other up it seemed, they were actually there to dance. I found one single Asian guy there, but being the pansy that I am, even after seeing him turned down a few times, I still couldn't go up and be like "Hey, teach me." I'm pathetic, but it was much fun none the less. I will prolly be going back with Ashley in the near future.   Then Saturday night was the... OMG! I just spilled coffee all over the place!!... night off Downtown Houston. We started out at Flying Saucer, which was nice for meeing people, open with couches and chairs, drinks and food. We hung out there probably for a good 1.5-2 hours, then moved to Saba Bluewater Cafe. Problem there was its just not made for big groups. You can't really move the chairs around so you have to split up to sit, and while the decor was awesome, I felt the energy drop alot. So we moved on to Mercury Room/ Boaka Bar. Wow! They do make clubs like this in Houston! The main dance floor played HipHop and Booty music, and the underground floor played more Dance/House music. They had bars on ever level (3), lots of sit and rest and lounge space, and the decor was like the inside of a sort of gothic palace. It was much fun, even though I'm a spaz of the bootiness. After that, Hedish, Ken, Ashley, Marshall, and I all stayed at the hotel that I got so that we didn't have to go home.     Guys   Well, lets see. I'm being to lose faith in seeing Man anytime soon. Apparently the company here, which is fairly new and growing faster than they know how to handle it seems, is very unorganized. They want Man to work for them, be a partner and all, come here and do stuff, but they can't get it together enough to tell him what they need so that he can plan accordingly. He hasn't gotten the info, so can't plan the trip here, and is already scheduled to be in North Carolina until May. *sigh* Plus, being on the job there, he can't really get online and chat, I guess his cell doesn't work there cause he hasn't called? I dunno.   Then there is another guy at the gym I have named "Hotness", a trainer. I have spoken breifly to Hotness once, now that I think about it, back several weeks ago when he asked if I was training to compete. I wish I had introduced myself then, DAMMIT!! But anywas, I'm too scared to even make eye contact with Hotness cause, once again, I'm a pansy.   Another guy called me last weekend, name shall be changed to protect the innocent. I shall dub him... Gibble Boy. Gibble Boy called me last weekend, after several drinks, and asked me  out on a date. We have been hanging out on a regular basis, and in that time I've thought he liked me and thought he didn't, so its kinda about time. ^_^ Well, he had been drinking, so now I'm wondering if he even remembers. I'll have to ask and make sure.   My mom also wants me to date Jess. He made quite an impression on all my girls and my mom. Neel, Russ, and Jess all made great impressions on my mom. She was amazed at how gentlemanly they were, cause you just can't find many guys like that anymore. So be proud of yourself guys. Keep it up! ^_^    Gym   Besides Hotness, other things go on at the gym. I work out. No really, I do. The candy gazing only goes on between sets and during cardio. I saw another swole woman there, and she was cut too. Obviously very low body fat levels. So now I have "competition", or more aptly, inspiration and a visible goal. Thats one thing that kept me so hard core about protein and attitude at the A&M Rec, the power lifter girls that came there. I felt like a hoss until they came in and I had to hide. I"ve been the biggest female at this 24 hour, so i think I've gotten slack on things, now I have someone there better than me so now I have to stay on my toes. This is good. I'm glad I'm second to someone, actually, keeps my stuff in check.     School and Work   I'm taking the GRE on Monday at noon. EEP! Then I turn in all my stuff ASAP. EEP! Then I should be a graduate student this summer. YAY! I hope I can find a good place to live near here, this 3 hour round trip commute is wearing me thin. I have no time for anything else but work and work out and I actually am MAKING time to eat. There are so many other things I want to do with my time and I just can't because of that stupid commute. THREE HOURS!! Plus, if I have a shorter commute, I can wake up later and I won't be so tired and listless at night thats another two hours that I can put to use. What would I use that time for? Well, taking care of personal bidness for one, cause many places are closed/closing by the time I get home now. I can pick up my study of languages also, cause there is really no time for that except my listening to Japanese and Spanish music and memorizing the lyrics and translations.   Work should be better now. "I'm going to cure cancer, and I have big biceps." I guess thats my main theme of things. ^_^ I'm going to do these assays I have going exactly like I did them in College Station. I'm also going to freeze down some cells this Thursday for safety's sake. Good to have stock in case, and so that I don't have to go around and beg for more cells. Yippee!     Y ahora muchachos, se acaba la rima!   Adios, kiddos.

      Nothing to do today, really, only ordering stuff. So I'm going to sneak out early, prolly around 4, and head to Foley's downtown and check out their selections on skirts and shoes. If nothing, I'll hit up Payless and Kohl's back in my neighborhood. I'd rather just get something here. Less time, less stress. I would like a skirt to match my yellow shirt I just got for my birthday. What color shoes though? I think i'll start with black strappies or pointies, cause  they will go with more stuff. If nothing to match the yellow, I'll try to match the blue shirt I got for Christmas. Eventually I would like to match both. Cause I could also match them with the yellow and blue halters I have. I would also like some more business-ish, professional-ish looking short sleeve and sleeveless tops. Its gonna get warm here real quick and seeing as I have to walk several blocks on my way to and from work, well, yeah.   The fat issue is getting to me. I can't let myself fall into the normal trend of growing complacent with fitness after college. I was avoided that freshman 15, now I need to avoid that post-college thing. I don't know if it has a name. Like I said before, once I start fighting again, that will help leaps and bounds. Not just cause the excersize, but normally the more into judo I am, the more aware of my food I am.   My shoulders are sore. I did something good yesterday at the gym. My upper abs are a bit sore too, good start I suppose. I don't get to lift today, but hopefully I will be dancing my calories off.   I found about 18 decent looking places to go Saturday night. They are pretty much all clustered around the Main/Preston intersection. I have a map and labeled them all out, all I need to really do is call and ask about cover. I can do that tonite before my girls show up? Or tomorrow before the crowd shows up? We'll see.   I need to organize this area. My work space is a mess. Too much has been done and the residue of papers and things is just in a stack, now two stacks, on and by my desk. Gibble. (Gee-blay!)   Mmmm.... clothes.....

      I know its been a long time since I’ve written (for me anyway), so there is much to update. The main reason I haven’t been staying on top of it all is cause Hedish isn’t online to update hers and therefore I have no inspiration. But here I go…  I had to go into work both days over the weekend. But that’s okay, cause the job will only pay for 40 hours a week, I just take off time during the week. So I left early on Wednesday so that I can go home and go to the gym early, then I came in late on Thursday. So now I’m even.   Speaking of the gym, they were doing the pinch thing for testing body fat percentage, and I was at 23%!!! So wait… does that mean that almost ¼ of my weight is white adipose tissue?!?! Something has to be done about this, something will be done about this…. But on a lighter note, this scrawny girl that went before me was at 30%. So I didn’t feel too bad. Heh. But still, I’m “fluffier” than I normally am, so I’m thinking that when I was all hard core and eating high protein, I bet it was at like, 16%. So when I start fighting again, for sure then, it’s all over, no more fattiness.   Tommy redeemed himself today. He actually called me up as early as 11am to see if I wanted to meet for lunch. I was just about to head to work, so I told him I would meet him at the light rail station near Rice University. He picked me up and we went to this Thai buffet place. Yumminess. So much for losing that fat, I guess that won’t be happening today.   Losing fat will just have to wait, cause it’s that time of the month that all I want to do is eat. Maybe that has something to do with it. Man, even Tommy said I wasn’t looking as hard core as I did last time he saw me. This is no good. I need to be fearsome. This is no good.   I’m going through Man with-drawl, by the way. Lately we have been able to talk most days online, and I got to talk to him on the phone for quite some time Monday night, which just made me wish I could see him more so. But he’s working in North Carolina as we speak, so he’s not able to just hop online. It’s Thursday and I haven’t gotten to so much as type to him. * sigh * I’m a mess.   The weather is so nice, and it was cool to walk around downtown inthe afternoon. Warm sunlight, cool breeze, and watching all the suits go and get their lunches. I need to buy a skirt, goodness. I call this condo place that had a sign "From $300" and I was thinking "There is no way that it means $300 a month, but there is no way they cost $300,000 at the lower end" so I called, and sure enough. $300,000 to buy. How crazy is that?   This Saturday is going to rock. Everyone seems excited. I need to finally put together a general route to start and finish sort of thing, cause once we get there, I'm sure everyone will be like, "Now what?" I hope it all works out like I have it in my head. I need a skirt for dancing and just because. A fun, pretty skirt. Tired of always denim or long. Okay, toodles.

      Everytime I sit infront of the TV or computer for more than, oh, 10 minutes, I hear yet another thing about the Janet Jackson fiasco. Give me a break, its not THAT big of a deal. Yeah, it was dumb and tasteless that it happened. The whole half time show was dumb and tasteless, all the skanky clothes, groping and slithering, and hig gyrating. Its a family show, folks, please. Anyways, let it go. The media, obviously bored out of their minds, is just making it a bigger deal than it really is. Let the wound heal, my goodness.   Clark is going to forget his shirts again. He's also going to forget the stuffed monkey. It shall be so. Hahahaha!  My judo boys are heading to Miami today. Infact, they should have left about 30 mins ago, which means in Judo Time, they are still waiting and calling people to get their lazy ass out of bed. I should be on that trip with them. I really really wanted to go. But I have a job, not only can I not leave it for a week, I get to work on weekends to keep up with my cells. Yippee.   Speaking of work, my latest WST assays aren't looking so hot. All the graphs look the same, which is bad. They look nothing like the previoius screens I have done. All the treatment levels are doing the same thing, and that is NOT whats supposed to be happening. Not hypotheically, but the results are completely different looking than from what I've gotten in the past. Damn the man, what am I doing?   I lied, Man leaves for North Carolina TODAY. He changed the flight. Like you all really care. Just an editor's note thing.   Getting a group together for St. Patty's day, its all in the works. If you wanna come, gimme a holler.   OH! I lied again. My 22RV1 cells, the prostate cancer cells, are giving me a good graph. What to think about this... hmm.... I think that I will seed only 1000 cells in the next round of screens with MCF7 and Panc-1, seeing as how they grow fairly fast. Maybe they are becoming confluent in there and then killing eachother off. Thats the only thing I can think of. I need to start also looking at the plate under the microscope before I start the assay. Once again, as though all you peeps care...  Meow that these graphs are done, I can move on to other things. Who wants to rent that movie this weekend?? Better yet, see the new movie by those people??

      I learn so many new things everyday. For example, my car-whispering friend, Hedish, also has taken the term "TV dinner" to the extreme. Yes, thats right, she  watches  food. Go read it for yourself, unless she has changed it to, once again, cover her tracks. She doesn't realize these actions of hers are out of the ordinary until I say, "You know, not many people, if anyone, does that." There is nothing inherently wrong with these "hobbies" of hers, but in her quest to be more agreeable with society, she tries to hide them.   And on another strange note today. I was sitting in Starbucks with my mom, and Madame Roseberry after church, a normal affair, when this guys that looks kinda like the dude that plays Wolverine from X-men comes in and gets something. As he leaves, he comes by, gets my attention by   putting his hand on my knee  and saying "I just want to tell you, you're georgeous." The physical contact at first made me want to lash out and throw down, but then he said that and I was like "Oh! Thank you!" Then he left with his whatever drink he bought. Left me in a bewildered state of shock. First of all, my ninja instincts tell me to remove limbs from a person that surprises me with physical contact. Then he says something like that and my female insticts say "hehehehe." *sigh* I dunno.   And I forget that the Hong Kong City Mall doen't take cards except at the grocery stores. So much for shopping outside of getting yakisoba noodles and jasmine tea. They don't do "cash back" at the checkout lines either.   Man left for North Carolina today. He'll be there until May, he says it looks like. He still asks that I meet him up there, and I told him about the misgivings I have about the whole situation. I would feel alot better about making an investment in something of that nature if before he would be able to come here, even for a little while, and we get to know each other better, being in the same place. Cause its one thing to click for a few hours a couples times, and its one thing to click on the phone or the internet, but face to face for an extended period of time can be trying and akward if the chemistry doesn't show itself to be what it seems. It does sound like fun though.   I also bought a CD of Brazilian music from Starbucks. Wheee. I need to burn some CDs for work listening pleasure. I don't like wearing headphones cause if someone tries to talk to me, well, yeah, its no good. Plus, I need to hear something else other than Chinese old-school pop music. No offense if you do like that, shoot, I listened to my fair share of late 90's Chinese pop, but yeah, I need something else.   In another response to Hedish's blog. I'm the other way. I'm wishing right now I was as driven and purposeful with every minute of my time as I was as an undergrad. Every minute of everyday, except perhaps Saturdays, was alotted to either class, work, research, workout, dance, judo, study, sleep, or food. Even on many Saturdays I had to go into the lab in the morning, then I was all about catching up on lost sleep, working out, and meeting Ashley for coffee at Sweet's. I miss those meetings, catching up, letting out, and just being.   I'm listening to Brazilian music, dribbling jasmine tea all over my desk, and waiting for my prostate cells to be ready for analysis. What a full life I lead, huh? I can't go to those other countries just yet, so I'll bring them to me. I can't wait until I get my own place. Financial freedom? Well, my own financial set of chains anyways. I don't know why people call it "financial freedom" from their parents, cause once they start paying for everything for themselves, you have to change your attitude towards finances and towards everything. I'm going to feel much more tied to my apartment then I did when my rent's paid for it. I"m praying that I can keep on top of everything well. I do have my head in the clouds alot.   I've decided on Spanish for a class. 1) I have the Japanese CD lesson set, so I just need to practice on my own. 2) If I learn Chinese and Spanish, I can go pretty much anywhere in the world I want. English and Spanish are the top two languages in the world (when you count how many countries consider them THE or one of the official languages) and Chinese, well, is spoken by more people in the world than any other language. And the Chinese as a people are an incredibly ubiquitous group. It would be benificial in my line of study to at least know some pleasantries. Such a courtesy extended to me from others always made me feel welcomed.   ~10 minutes until my prostate cells are ready.   Okay, I'm done with today's rambling, this probablly wasn't as entertaining as it was the other day, but I don't have the same quantity of blissful azucar running through my veins.

      Tommy was on Spring Break this whole week and only just called me last nite. Shame on you. Why is your spring break then anways? The REAL UT has spring break from 15-19, like normal universities.   I don't think he's actually in school. I think he strips for bachelorette parties for a living and tap dances on the corners of downtown Dallas.   Sugar opens a new conscienceness that I haven't tapped into recently. I think that its sugar that opened my eyes to the plight of humanity at the hands of squirrels. It was sugar that displayed the compelling evidence for my human eyebrow theory. Thanks to sugar, I can successfully imitate and scare the bejeezus out of Hedish with my velociraptor impersonations. Thanks to that sweet substance of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, I have made my life and the world around me a better place to live.   Now if only my hands would stop shaking......  Hedish has shown herself to be a car whisperer. She's gonna talk to my Honda and get him to clean up his act. I bet he will complain that I never really gave him a name. Well, if he had more personality, I would. But for now, Hiroshi is all he gets.   Hmmm... Hiroshi Kazenaka. How's that sound? My little Civic with a big name.   Riddle me this. Whats a wimble? Does it taste good? Oishii?   I got to talk to Kazuki on MSN today. Yeah for online dictionaries. I've been having trouble speaking to myself in Japanese these days. I've been paying attention to Spanish things too much. They are getting all scrambled. But after the first few minutes, I was back to the nihongo way of things. I need to study. No, first I need to work on GRE. Gibble. (I want that pronounced "gee-bblay" from now on.  So let it be written, so let it be done! )  This Saturday Conner goes to Thailand. This Saturday Jessie comes to Houston. This Saturday Tommy goes to Dallas. This Sunday Man goes to North Carolina. This Sunday I go to work. A weekend of excitement for all! Also, my boys from A&M judo will be making their way to Miami this weekend for a week of fun in the sun and fighting at the National Collegiate Judo Tournament! GO, MY BOYS!!! GANBATTE!! MERDE!! SUERTE!! AND ALL THOSE OTHER LANGUAGES I DON"T KNOW!! This weekend, Mario and his team from ITESM Univ will be competing in the Mexico Nat'l Judo Tournament. I can't wait to hear how they do either. One crazy arse weekend for all.   ~15 minutes until my prostate is ready to be checked out.   How is it that my MSN at home always somehow changes from "Busy" to "Away" then to normal as if I was there AFTER I have already left the house. I set it to BUSY, dagnabit. I'm  gone ! Meduele la estomaga. Cookies wo tabesugi. Uff!  ~8 more minutes..........  Yeah, it took me that long to write that little. Art takes time. I'm gonna go find something more productive to do. Later, kids.

      Well, Kroger didn't have the bus pass that I needed. I was already late to work, so that they could tell me this, so I took the bus into downtown to get one at the Metro store. They won't take cards there unless you have a driver's liscence or a state ID on you. I don't drive around, so I leave my driver's liscence with the gym pass. Tough luck. Social security and school passes don't count. I miss the first train to the Medical Center and I get to wait for the next one. When I finally get into work, 9:45 am, I can't find my media. Luckily, Maen had just moved it to another location rather then cleaning out the bottles, and I claimed a new shelf as my own. Now the hood has been busy for the past hour and I have so much stuff to do, seeding all these cells for compound and inhibitory screenings. Anyways....  Downtown in the morning is fun to see (on a lighter side). The sun glistening off the buidlings, all the people bustling about, the arcitechure of the historic area really comes out to you in the morning light, shadows outlining the sculpturing along the windows and eves. If only I was fabulously well-to-do, and I could rent a loft above one of these quaint little places.   Once again, I'm addicted to Starbucks coffees. Today I forgot my coffee mug of nerdom (along with my lunch) so I just got a tall coffee. Is all good. I need it after this morning.   I did squats at the gym for the first time in three months without any pain. Whoa!! It felt really good, to do that again. I'm sure I'll be quite sore in the bum-back-hamstring area tomorrow. Takes two days for me to get really sore. Oh look! The hood is free! So long, suckas!

      I'm gonna go into work late today. Mostly because I need to buy a bus pass and the customer service thing in Kroger doesn't open until 8. So in the meantime I am going to write here and if time permits, I'll go to Walmart to get some protein bars and sodas for my lunches and snacks.   I have a new theory as to why I don't date white guys. First consider my high school. During my socially formative years, I was very used to being surrounded by a plethora of ethnicities and other cultural backgrounds. My high school made College Station look like Nazi Germany. So, after being in that sort of situation, white guys look too much like me and all look like they could be my brother. There ya go. I've tried to imagine in my head me with a white guy, and it just looks weird to me.   I'll have to spend more time in the lab this weekend than I was hoping. Maybe I'll get some GRE studying in. Okay, laters.

      Most of the morning after i got into work, I spent helping Maen organize the lab. When I came in, Ismael had everything kinda haphazardly placed here and there. Some pipets on one side, others on the other side, half the tissue culutre stuff across the lab from the hood. Well, thats all taken care of now. The only thing is that we pulled all this randomness from Ismael's desk after he left and we have no idea what its used for or why he had it. So there is a junk shelf. Kinda like that junk drawer everyone has in their office and kitchen. But there is so much space now, it really looks alot better. And I put fun colored labels up on everything so that we know from a glance where it all is. yay!  My back feels so much better. I was actually able to do that reverse crunch that I love to do the other day and I felt no pain what so ever. Its super sore now from those, cause I hadn't done them in a while. I'll wait until later to do them again. The twisting thing too, all those twisting things I did gave me a nice V shape from my shoulders to waist. I want that back. I think that next month I will start fighting again. Be prepared for the stiffness and the pain. I'm not going to want to move the next day. Its good for me. Its good for me.....  I think that I'm going to have to spend much time here in the lab this weekend. I wanted to seed all my cells today so that I wouldn't have to come in on Sunday (anticipating partying on Saturday), but they aren't confluent enough so I'm giong to have to do it tomorrow. >_  I'm an official nerd! I now have a promo tumbler from USA Scientific. I've started looking at the promo page when I place orders and finagle things so that our lab gets something free. We also got a "Midwest Scientific Lab Shark" t-shirt. Sheng took that one. Too big for me or Ping. We also got a free calculator. Ping says that there are usually vendor shows around the medical center and the people are always passing out free things like candy, mugs, shirts, pens, and the like. PENS!! yay!  I need to invest in some strappy heels. If I'm gonna go salsa dancing, I need all the help I can get to make my hips move. Heels! I've never really had HEELS before.   Okay, back to work. Ordering and organizing and waiting for cells to grow. I need to look for an apartment too.

      How do you measure a year in a life?  My mom got me the CD of the Broadway recording of the song RENT. Appropriate, no? I love this musical, and I was gonna go see if for my b-day, but instead we are going to go see Thwyla Tharp choreography to Billy Joel music. Twyla Tharp, people! Man, I'm psyched! I miss dancing like a person would miss their legs. >_  My dad and Marylin took me to Miyako's instead since I've never been there. It was pretty good! No, really good! You walk in and people yell "Irasshaimase!" which is cool. Reminds me of this great little yakiniku place in Hikone I would eat at everynow and then. This Miyako's even has a tatami sitting area. Niiice. We got a plethora sushis and I got this dunner combo plate that has some teriyaki chicken, teriyaki salmon, cream cheese puff, chicken wing, fried rice, beef roll thing (gave to the father) and some tempura veggies, with salad and soup as well. I was kinda sad that it wasn't miso soup, I really like that stuff.   Then they took me back to my car and I went home and fell asleep. Hehehe. But, I didn't get to make the cookies I wanted, didn't get any of my b-day cookie my mom had gotten, and yeah. So my actual birthday was kinda abbreviated by that. I woke up again at 11pm, but the mom was already in bed, so I took a shower and went on the bed for good. Thats how I'm easily up so early. *sigh* Oh well.   I did find cheaper tickets to North Carolina, but I think that I'm not going to go this time. Its so tempting, and I really do want to see him again, but from an analytical, logical standpoint, there is no gaurantee that it will be all peachy keen. I mean, we got along really well for the several hours that we did get to hang out, but it was only several hours. Who knows how things would go if we are forced to spend every moment together for a long weekend. Kinda intense this soon, I would say. Running off to a state I've never been to with a man I've only hung out with for fewer hours as there are fingers on my hands, well, thats a little brash for me. If he comes to Houston again for work, and we get to hang out more (I'm going to want to spend every moment I can with him, he's just fascinating) and things are still grand, then yeah, I'll meet him there the next time he goes. But for now, Imma play it safe. Plus, that weekend is Clark's Longhorn Singers performance, and I still have yet to hear him sing since he started college, and I can go party with him after that. ^_^   I'll write more once I get to work. Bai for now.

      Well, I went to book a hotel room for the group downtown funness night, and I found a cheap-ish Holiday Inn on Main Street. I'm like, "Great, Main Street, that's where we'll be." Nope, its Main Street in the medical center. Argh! I found another Holiday Inn near the convention center downtown, so I"m going to go to the one near here (med center) and BEG BEG BEG to let me switch it over and pay the difference. PLEASE!!!  So if they let me do that, I will be sitting pretty. If not, well, I'll have to look into some sort of cab service? Sheesh, I would do this to myself, after getting so excited.   Boy, I sure am hungry.....  So today for dinner the papadeaux is taking me to Todai for sushi madness. I heard that Miyako's is also really good, so I'll ask him what he recommends more highly.   Nothing much going on today. Later, kids!

      Today is the day of resolutions. I'm tired of being so-so about my health and academic convictions. I want to get back to the self ass-kicking ways that I used to have. First, no more sitting in front of the TV eating dinner for an hour and a half before I go to the gym. Eat a snack and go! The TV will turn my brain to mush and my body to flab. Then, no more sitting in front of the computer for another 1.5 hours after my work out before my shower. I will have my protein shake and shower immediately! That will save me a total of at least 3 HOURS that I can put towards studying for the GRE, cell cycle, apoptosis, Japanese, and Spanish! Not really in that order, GRE comes first, and once thats out of the way, I can get to the other things. ^_^   Then there is my eating habits. I'm not a complete food ogre, I'm fairly mindful about which foods eat and keep around the house. But thats just not good enough. I need to get back to my protein ladden stir frys, scrambly surprises, boca stuffs, and chicken dishes. Get some protien bars for snacks instead of low fat muffins and "Skinny Cow" ice cream sandwiches. Sure, they are low fat, low cal, and all, but empty calories all the same. EMPTY!! I was prolly in my best shape back in September and October, I want to get back there again. I was at my skinniest back in April last year but that was kinda scary......  hip bones should not be that visible.....  I seriously love languages. Can I juggle studying Mandarin, Japanese, and Spanish? I think so. ^_^ I'm in Houston! Spanish is everywhere! I'm in science! Mandarin is everywhere! I'm in ..... my head!! Japanese is everywhere! hahaha! I try to put sentences together in Spanish these days, and I have to say it in my head in Japanese first, isn't that sad? English is closer to Spanish, yet I have to go through this other completely unrelated language to get there.   GRAD SCHOOL! Everything is falling into place it seems, I talked to the chairman of grad studies in biomed science, and he said that I just need to take the GRE, and get that, application, and transcripts all in together and he and the board willl breifly review and decide. They aren't too strict with people like me, when a prof specifically wants to bring a person straight into a lab, because they figure that if Dr Safe wants me, they trust him enough and why should they keep me out? Yippee! I'm gonna be Dr. Kristin Newman, PhD in a few years!   My mom wants me to get a 1 bedroom apartment instead of an efficiency. I told her I'll look into it, but I refuse to pay more than $400 a month. Plus, I argued that I just don't have the furniture to fill a 1 bedroom, and she is all like "Well, I'll help you out, and we can go to Goodwill and garage sales and such." She had a point though, if people were to come visit me and needed a place to stay, I couldn't really offer much in an efficiency. But with a 1x1 place, a couch would be more inviting. Then she is like "where will you sit to watch TV with friends?" Ummm, I don't have a TV. "You will aquire these things." Ummm, I don't want a TV? I don't want cable. I just want cable modem. If I get a TV, I'll only use it for rented movies, so it would have to have a VCR or DVD player. If people come over, I'm going to want to be like "Lets go DO something!!" I don't want to be like that guy I used to date, "Uhh, I just wanna watch TV, LOOK, the food channel! Oh! Gundams on the computer!" Blah.   I shouldn't bad mouth people on the internet. Too public a forum. Oh well, he deserves it. ^_^  I have a serious addiction to Starbucks. I'm always getting the bold coffee with a shot of hazelnut. And its soooooo good. My mom is like "I can't beleive you're spending money on $4 coffee!" No! its less than $2 still, even with the flavor shot! And it gives me happy, warm, fuzzy feelings to walk around the med center, early in the morning, through the garden by IBT (which is so very very pretty) listening to my MD Player and sipping on yumminess of Starbucks brew.   Speaking of brews... ST. PATRICK'S DAY is coming  up!! Screw St Valentine, that horny fool, LETS KILL SOME SNAKES!! hahaha! Who wants to go out with me to Downtown or the Rice Village the Wednesday night?? Drink some green beer?? I'll actually drink a beer for the spirit of the event, so you guys should come out to witness the faces I'll be making as I choke it down. I know my Houston crew should be in, its your Spring Break. ^_^  Okay, sayonara para ahora. ^_^

      Its FRIDAY, and I'm happy, even though I still have to come into work tomorrow morning. Hey, I'm paid hourly, its all good. ^_^ I still haven't tried Niko Niko's on Montrose, but the weather is nasty so I think I'll pass until the sun comes out. "Here comes the sun, do-n-doo-doo, here comes the sun, and I say, 'It's alright.'" Of course, the day that the boss comes in I don't have as much to do. I need to schedule my assays so that my day is packed and I'm staying late when he is here to look good. But I like to think that he sees the info coming out right now and knows that I'm working. Yeah, I'll think that.   My prostate doesn't want to grow. I know its supposed to grow slowly, but I'm kinda worried. Well see, I'll prolly have to run that again. I do anyways, always at least do twice, and if there is a major difference, I do it again. The boss started talking about all the things he wants to start looking into and my head is spinning. I need to read up on things, start a list of things to become an expert in. See, I just need to start grad school so that I'm putting this towards more than just a paycheck.   Did I tell you guys that Man wants me to go spend some time in North Carolina with him? How awesome would that be, its supposed to be beautiful, but I still consider myself broke. Perhaps later in the spring or this summer when the water is warmer. He said that he would cover me once I got there, but no, I couldn't let him do that. I'm too cheap, and I would feel un-right about having someone else be uncheap. Plus, a plane ticket would probably cost as much as the language class I want to take.... Japanese or Spanish.... Japanese or Spanish.....  Okay, so I met.. shoot, I got distracted, who did I meet? OH! I met this lady, Denise, who works on this floor in the other lab and she told me and Maen about all the cool things that there are in this city. Where and when to be to see the colorful people, where to go look for the hole in the wall bars, what clubs are posh but fun and what are free to get in and all this. Soooo, next time all you kids are in Houston, we have things to do out the booty! I have copies of maps too. Houston is so much better than I remember.   I talk to Dr. Safe today, and he seemed really receptive about me starting graduate school with him in this lab. He told me to get my application in ASAP, take a few weekends to study the GRE, and if I get between 1250 and 1300, they can push to have my first year paid for by the school rather than his lab. That's it, a 1300. I can do that with a bit o' studying. Making myself study is the only thing. But mainly, the application needs to get in ASAP so he can start the pushing to have me transferred over to a PhD program. I need to find people who will write my letters of recommendation. Dr. Safe said he'll write one, I can ask Dr. Yu, and I suppose I'll ask Dr. Harris, my biochem professor. He's the only other professor that I really had much in the way of academic contact with. Yipee! This is so exciting!!   Today is an organization day. First, all the papers from orders I've put in and received. I file them according to company in a binder, and they have been stacking up the last couple of weeks. Then I need to seriously organize my head as far as this research. I feel behind, but I think that's mostly because I'm the newest here so obviously everyone here knows what's up far beyond what I do.   Oh look, the sun is starting to come out. Yippee!!  What to do tonite? I need to lift, its a legs day. Then perhaps, I dunno, I should read my Cell book, but its so heavy, I don't want to take it home. It will stay up here, I can read it while my WST assay in incubating. What? You don't care. ^_^  Looks like I'll be in Houston now for the next 3-4 years. All righty, boys, you know where I am. ^_~

      I just ate Thai food on Bellaire with Conner. My mouth is aflame. It was really good, the chicken was beautiful, and so cheap. A plate the size of.... a .....rice cooker lid! Yeah. Covered in rice then each side gets a different type of dish. I got some pork thing and a medium spice level chicken curry. And that was $2.95! So for both our plates, just over $6!! He was nice enough to pay before I even realized. Isn't he sweet? Soo will be kicking herself soon enough. He'll find someone great, realize he can do better than she can hope to offer.   I called the doctor. Apparently the x-ray shows that I have mild scolerosis (sp?) and mild artheritis in my back. Huh?? Well, I am stiff often. But I have been feeling so much better in just this past week. I think that by April, I can get back to the judo thing. They gave me the number of a doctor specialist that I can call and get more detailed info on what this all means for me now and in the future.   Japanese or Spanish? Japanese or Spanish? Hmmmm... I think Mandarin is a given, seeing as how Ping is will to work with me during lunch.   This Saturday I'm going to College Station to see Ashley and we will go to see Havana Nights. Hehehe, this is a tribute to a particular time in my life, according to Ashley. ^_^   Weather is nasty here and now. That means I go directly home. No wandering around downtown. Sadness. Oh well. I need to play with my breast cells some more. "Its all fun and games until you get mauled by a bobcat!"

      Cancer cells that is. Yes, I now an growing breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer cells at work. You know what, I looked at my prostate today, and its beautiful. ^_^ Lovely little fibroblasts, just growing happily away. Poor guys don't realize that tomorrow they will be bombarded with these lovely chemicals to  make them explode!!  But I'm busy now at work. In fact, I shouldn't be writing all this up here, I  should  be working on my proliferation assays. But I just got in, its still early, and I need to regroup.   Today is Thursday, if I want next weekend free, I need to plan to seed many many 96 well plates this Sunday for various tratment combo assays. Sheesh.   I got to talk to Man in Seattle yesterday. We usually keep missing each other on the phone, and when we did talk, poor guy has to use an ear peice and hold his phone up as high as he can. Cell phones are so weird, America needs to get it together. If we had a system like Japan, man, no one would ever need ground phone and it would be easy and great and yeah. its slowly getting there, I can see it happening.   But anyways, looks like he'll be taking on  another  job with a company in Houston. Perhaps that means he'll be here more often? I can only hope. He wanted more pics of me and this made me realize how bad I am about taking pics. Well, I take them, but they are always of me and other people. And he wanted "cute" or "sexy" pics, and really, I'm just goofy. Thats about all I do.   I just want to say, I've included links to my friends' blogspots, so you all should check them out. Look on the side bar.   Mmmm.. muffins.  I will call the doctor today and find out about the back. Wish me luck, I want to fight again. I miss fighting. I must fight.   I also need to call places about apartments. Greenhouse Patio never emailed me back. Makes me wonder. Grrrr.. Metro doesn't email back either. Lets see if Lorna does. Oh! I need to fax in a time sheet! Later, kids!

       Work  I finally have things to keep me somewhat occupied. The thing is, I'll be really busy for a few hours, then since these are 24 hour treatments, I don't have anything to do until the next day. Perhaps today I'll get some reading in, trying to learn more background on apoptosis and the cell cycle and what signals are involved in all this. Yeah, sure I learned about this stuff in undergrad classes, but who remembers that. And even if I did, we didn't get deep enough into it. So, I'm graduated and still studying. ^_^ I kinda like it like that.    The Passion of the Christ  People are making way too big a deal about this. First, anti-Jew? What ever. When I saw it, it gave me no indication that I should have ill feelings toward the Jews. What it did say to me was to watch out for the dangers of "group think". It is a perfect example of how horrible things can come of logical people with half-baked feelings when they get swept up in the passions of the fanatical. And as horrible as it looks, is it really? Were it not for the death of Jesus, were would I be? It had to happen like this. Plus, there have been countless movies about just the World Wars that make Germans and Japanese look really bad. Where is the great crying out about these? Sure, there were debates, but nothing compared to what people are saying about this movie.   Then the violence. Have you  seen  "Saving Private Ryan"? Plus many other mobster, horror, and other such films with violence. No one made a great hullabaloo about these. Well, not in comparison to the whining going on now, anyways. And in all truth, having read up on crucifixion myself, it was actually much more horrible than depicted in this movie. Imagine, as bad as it is here, and this is actually watered down.   The verdict? For me, I would have to say that people are making a great fuss simply because its religious and that makes people very squirmy in today's society. Especially with Christianity, for some reason people see it as a greater threat to them personally than any other religion. I'll say that's mainly due to the fact that people don't  get  Christianity. It certainly isn't what I thought it was back in my atheist/agnostic days. Oh, I could go on and on.    Birthday  Lets see, I'm turning 23. This sounds so much older than 22 for some reason. Why? Perhaps cause it no longer sounds like an undergraduate age. Doesn't look like I'll be doing much on my b-day cause its on a Tuesday night, but I'm hoping to get a bunch of people together on the 20th for a belated bash. Its at the end of Spring Break for most of my friends so I'm hoping that everyone will be free. But I can mooch food off of the 'rents. Maybe I'll have one take me to Papasito's and one to Todai. Todai  on  my birthday since the buffet is free! Yipee!!    Languages  I love languages. I miss studying them. I looked into Japanese and Spanish classes. At Rice U they have eight week sessions, 3 hours a week, for $335. The classes at UH are two week intense studies at 10 hours a week. I think that the Rice deal is better, cause I can't sit still in a Saturday class that long and its cheaper. So I'm thinking taking a Japanese class this summer at Rice and I'm going to look into Spanish at either Houston Community College or Tomball Community college, much cheaper. Too bad they don't offer Japanese there. Oh well.    More about work  They are going to blow the building up across the street from here. They are also going to record it from some windows here, I want to see that. One day, I'll come back to work on Monday, and it will be a pile of rubbish. I'm getting more cells today. So now I will have two lines of breast cancers, and one (hopefully two) lines of pancreatic cancer. Yeah, I'll be busy. Eventually I'm suppose to start doing westerns (that's where my studying of background comes in) at 12 and 24 hour chemical treatments. I'm kinda worried, cause I live far enough away that it will be a real pain to have to come in 12 hours from treatment time to take off media and freeze down the cells for protein extraction later. Blech. I'm going to get my own place in May I think, that's when my gym membership is up.    Gyms  I got asked again if I'm training for power lifting or body building. Nope, not so much. I really don't think I look that big or cut. I've looked more cut before, when I was really conscience about my carb/protein/calorie ratios. (Never Atkins, which is the devil, prolly closer to South Beach with the occasional HEB muffin ^_^) And I'm not that crazy about the workouts I do. I'm serious, but not nearly enough so for competition. Which makes me wonder, what could I be if I really set my mind to it? Started taking the supplements and changed my workouts to really hone in on specific muscle groups and went back to the 125g o' protein a day regimen. I'm afraid I'd be scary. Once again, if I ever get veiny, tie me up and feed me doughnuts. No, muffins.... mmmm... muffins.....   And Another Thing  By the way, I'm a dweeb. And if you've actually read this far, you probably are too. ^_^

      I'm loving Houston, don't get me wrong. There is so much to do, so much culture, so many things to explore. The art, the museums, NASA, The Medical Center, the nightlife. And its a very mature sort of place to be, the kind of place that good for business people and a more high class feeling than what I remembered. Its nice to be a part of that, I certainly have much at my disposal for becoming a more cultured, well rounded person. But sometimes, I just need to feel 22, (well, almost 23) rather than part of the 30-something group.   This is where Austin comes in.   It also is cultured, in a counter-culture sort of way, and this appeals to a whole different side of me. Austin's high culture is Houston's counter-culture, in so much that its there, visibly existent, but not nearly so pervasive. Downtown Houston is full of jazz lounges and restraunt cafes at the lobby level of blue windowed buildings. Austin's downtown is a hodge-podge of old, nearly run down buildings of bygone eras, packed with darkened clubs ranging from "Rainbow Cowboy Bars" to "Live Music of the Serenghetti". And, no, I don't think I spelled that right.   Its the live music. The live music draws me like a moth to flame. Almost like me to DNA. It could be music I would never listen to on the radio (heavy metal, rap, or Brittany Spears) but if it was live, I would have to stop and listen. Walking down some street to find food, this sycopated, heavy drum beat wafts across the sidewalk. Sounding tribal and passionate all at once. I had to just stop and stare into the doorway of the hole in the wall club, and strain to get a glimpse of the percussionist in the dark.   Yes, they have places like that in Houston, but not quite as common an occurrence.   And what tops Austin off is the countryside that sits right outside the city limits. Lake Travis is beautiful, and then if you drive a bit  you can get to Enchanted Rock, my absolute favorite place. (except perhaps Colorado Springs) I'm going to have to go back, even if I have to go alone.   Houston is great. Partly, though, because its close to Austin. ^_^

      You know, I've been asked several times now since graduating from college if I compete in lifting or building or something. When I say no, they ask if I've ever thought of doing it. I usually just laugh. I mentioned to Spencer once that these people are putting ideas in my head, and he flipped out about how I should do it.   Now I'm reading sites on  urlLink BodyBuilders.com  about how to get into those fitness competitions. I'm begining to think I should give it a try... I do love to lift weights, I'm loving the shape that the resulting muscles give me, and it would be a great incorporation of my dance background. I'm thinking I could do it.   If I did, I wouldn't even consider competing until next winter. I think I have a fairly good start, but I have a  looooong  way to go. Plus, I would want to talk to someone who knows the ins and outs of it all, reading these things online only can get you so far. I would want tips on choreography and training. I don't think I can afford to hire a personal trainer or professional choreographer, but I choreographed alot of my own stuff in the past.   Swim suits though, they freak me out. They didn't last August. So its not impossible. I got to that shape in a month. Then I would just have to step it up from there.....   One thing I have against me maybe is my height? The "tall" division is 5'4 and up. I'm 5'9. (Well, 5'8 and 3/4ths.) its harder to get the thicker, tight muscles on longer frames. Course, being a possible head taller than many of the girls might give me an advantage too. I think it helped in dance competitions. Long lines and all.   I'm going to have to change my diet, which I have been doing slowly. I need to add a few more supplements to my regime. Already I'm taking a multi-vitamin, calcuim, and C with a thermogenic. I've read that L-glutamine is a must and read many good things about BCAAs. I can't find those at Walmart and Target though. ^_^ I might order them online, not so expensive on that site. An of course, I have my whey protein. Now that I'm out of the house, I don't have to worry about the having snacks around. My mom like carbs alot, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I'm not active enough right now to take them in and still get where I want to be.   I'm still kinda on the fence about all this. I'm worried about the expenses of it all..... training, supplements, costumes, memberships and entry fees. And if I get addicted to it, well, theres no stopping me then. I dunno. And the whole getting a more tan look. Won't that look funny on a red head? How dark is dark enough? And will those salf-tanners look alright? They have to, I'm not going into a bed! I draw the line there!  I'm in the  business  of cancer research, folks. You won't see me sun bathing or in a tanning salon.   Plus, I get kinda bitchy when I'm severely dieting. Judo experience tells me so. Judo experience also tells me that I can lose 12lb in two weeks. Then Spencer made fun of my hips.... I'm still traumatized. Experience also tells me that nothing chisels my waist line like dancing does. So I need to do that in a major way.   Okay, lets move on, shall we?  I have my dance performance dress rehersal tonite. I'm kinda hoping we dont' have to wear the costumes. I like the tops, but I'm not crazy about the capri length jagged edge tights. The top is fun, one sleeve off the shoulder thing. But with the bottoms, I feel like Bam-Bam. I tried to push wearing jeans with the top, but no one took it. Blast. Its just so...  costume -ish. Reminiscent of my drill team and dance recital days. Of couse, this IS a drill team dance show, after all. Oh well.   My show is this weekend.     Gold Duster 30th Reunion Spring Show  Friday, April 30th and Saturday, May 1st  7pm, Jersey Village High School    You should come see it. My dance will rock!   So what if its only about a 2 minute dance in a nearly 2.5 hour show.  Man wants to see it, so I need to find a way to record from VDO to DVD or CD. I'll take it with me to NC. Which I'm still excited about. Counting down the days. Whee!  I have a meeting with a person at 24 Hour to set up a membership. Yeah. I'm tired of signing in already. We'll see what they have to offer. If I can get an all clubs pass for not much more, I might. Cause then I can also go to 24 Hour Eye Candy. This one I'm at doesn't get that name. Too bad, huh? Its okay, it has weights.   Okay, I really should do some work while I'm here. Later, kids.

      Still going to North Carolina. I'm just as excited as getting away from all this as I am about seeing Man again. I'm trying to remember the last time I just got away, alone or with friends, not counting going and visiting family or the school related things. I don't count that cause its more of an obligation than an adventure. I guess it was the road trip that I took with my Houston Crew the August after I got back from Japan. That was nearly two years ago! Yeah, you could say that I'm just a bit restless.   And seeing Man again will be great. These past two months have forced us to get to know each other on more of a mental level first. For as long as its been, its exciting that he still calls fairly often and emails and messages me. The other day, he even started to fix my computer. Yup, from Seattle! He's got skills, I dunno. My MSN Messenger has been being dumb, and he got it to work for him, but its still dumb for me. But what ever he did, its running faster now. He said there were more things needed to be done, but just didn't have time then. Hey, I'll take what I can get, ya know!?!   I'm in the process of trying to get back a swim suit body. Last August, yeah, thats when it was nice. Well, I had no time to eat and I had lots of anger then. Anger can be a very powerful source of motivation. Can't exactly say that I have that anymore. So I'm back to only stocking my kitchen with things that aren't really snack-able or have a great protein to calorie ratio. Plus I've been reading alot of articles on fitness competitions from  urlLink BodyBuilders.com  and taking tips from there. Its the best site I've found so far in getting good nutrition and fitness tips. Many sites online are geared towards girls that just wanna be thin. Too general.   But now I'm psyched!   I hope my new set of experiments works. I just started one of 8-day screens today. Made some new chemical dilutions to try to compensate for the errors that I have been seeing in past assays. I need to fill my water bottle.   My apartment still rocks!   I'm really going to try to keep it clean. So far, about two weeks now, so good. I've been picking up after myself, everything has a place, and the kitchen counters get wiped down after a meal. I'm even washing my dished almost every night. I say almost cause last night I got home from Walmart at 12:30am, and just pretty much fell into bed.   I am kinda revitalizing my  urlLink website . I'll also have a link to the left for it. Its just a place where I'm linking to various emails I've gotten, essays and articles, and noteworthy websites. Its partly for me as much as for sharing with others. I want to remember these cooler links I get and I can't store them all here or in my AIM profile.   I wore my hair in double french braids today. I've been told I look like a little doll. Yeah, I think that it makes me look a bit younger to do this. So if I ever need to pass as, say, 16, I can take off all my make-up and french braid my hair. Also remove my, ahem, "enhanced support system" and that should do the trick. Oh, and I'll have to wear a pink something and clunky shoes.   Mmmm.. I bought some fruits and juices and yogurt at Walmart last nite to make smoothies with. I might do that for dinner tonite. I'll throw in my whey protein too. Yippee! I'm excited. I'm probably also going to go ahead and freeze most of the fruit so it doesn't get a chance to go bad. I doubt I'll be making one everyday. We'll see how much work it is.   This weekend is my Gold Duster Reunion Spring Show! The dance that me and the other girls put together is so kick ass. I hope everyone still remembers it. I've been listening to the music in the car, cause I don't have a tape deck anywhere. Where is my mint green rice cooker looking CD player?? I used to take it to the hill days, I think I lent it to someone and now its disappeared. Grrr....  Anyways, I'm dancing. I'm happy. Dance = Happy. I just wish the classes weren't so friggin' expensive.   My brother is having his Derelict party this Saturday. I encourage everyone to go. Either dress Derelict or really really really ridiculously good looking. Oh, man, I wanna see that movie again.   Did someone say Man?  My arms still hurt. I had a killer bicep and back workout on Monday. It hurts to straighten my arms. Popping my elbows has been a near impossibility. Lets see if I can tear up my triceps like that tonite. Before the gym, I'm gonna hit up Super Target and see if I can find the supplements that I want. BCAA is supposed to be really great, and I want some glutamine. I also want to purchase a chin up bar to but in the kitchen entry way. One of those spring loaded ones. We'll see how much all of this costs. For those days when a trip to the gym just isn't happening.   I write so much, I just babble. I can't beleive anyone actually reads this stuff.   I haven't said this in a while, and I think its imperative that I remind everyone: He is absolutely fascinating! And I think you know of who I speak.

      I'm excited. I'm getting out of Texas, finally! Even if it is only for a weekend. And I'm not going to Louisianna, Mississippi, or some other state I don't count. This is a state I've never been too. Cape Hatteras, I think I'm the only person who had never heard of that place before. And I'm nervous/excited about seeing Man again. Will we still click as well as we did when we met? Will over 48 hours of constant contact be okay? I'm sure it will be fine. I just hope I don't dissapoint him? Its the whole, I'm confidant as a human, I'm not so confidant as a girl. I dunno.   At any rate, its going to be fun.   At any rate. Duht.   I had a 7.5 hour dance practice last Saturday. I was scared to death it was going to be pre-choreographed, easy, and dull. But nope! We picked our own music, and choreographed it ourselves. Kim, Suzanne and I had continued dancing after high school, so between our three brains, I think we have come up with something rather spiffy.   But, oh man, did we hurt the next day. We got together again to go over the counts and set placements and focus for the dance, and every single one of us were in pain. But our enthusiasm was still there. Kim and Jennifer are going to pick up some fun things for us for hair and make-up and the like. Its going to be so much fun. It already has been so much fun!  Plus, its nice to know that I still "got it". Buchner said that I'm still a monster leaper, and Kim, Suzanne and I are able to hit out foutte turns perfectly (so far). Together! Thats hard to do cause there are so many ways to do the turns.   I looked up the closest Super Target and Super Walmarts near where I live now. yay! Here I come!  I want to start sprints again, I should have started long ago when my back healed. Today! After I eat, around 7 while its still light out, I'll hit up the tract between the YMCA and the high school. Then hit the weights, then hit one of the Super Stores. preferabley Walmart, their food is cheaper.   Yeah for me, I'm forcing myself to drink more water! Oh, I should have some tea now!  Its about time they blow up this building.   My apartment rocks.  My new patches for my bag rock (a judo and an Irish flag one).   My cancer cells, well, they are still there.   I want to be productive but I did my work Sunday night, so there isn't much to do now. Thats why I'm here. Man said that he can get on my computer from SEATTLE (yeah, really) and try to figure out why its being dumb. He'll take one look at it I bet and be like "Damn, girl. You f-ed this thing up!"   Catfish! I have catfish in my fridge! I'm eating that for dinner! Mmmm... catfish.

      As everyone probably knows, after I get my PhD, I want to do my post doc abroad. My boss here has the hook up in Japan, Germany, and England. Also as everyone knows, I LOVED Japan, and really want to go back. But after reading these two articles ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) well, Germany isn't sounding so bad. And think of all the travel options I will have! I mean, hey! Long weekend? Lets go to Spain! Or Greece!   Maybe I'm a bit ahead of myself.   I"M GOING TO NORTH CAROLINA FROM MAY 7TH TO 10TH!!! Its going to be so much fun. Biggest adventure I've had in a long while. I've never been to that state, and once there, I've got it all laid out for me. I'm actually flying into Virginia and Man is picking me up at the airport, then we go back to Cape Hattaras. He says he will bring his small kite so that he can teach me to kite board! Yay! Its supposed to be so pretty, he sent me a post card a few days ago that he bought there. I'm so excited. Hmmm... two weeks to get my swim suit body in line. Protein!!  Speaking of getting in shape, the other night I didn't go to the gym (actually, I did, but once there I realized I forgot my pass and my towel so I went home) and I did some ballet barre excersizes in my living room. I HAVE A LIVING ROOM!! Anyways, I forgot how friggin' hard that stuff was. Damn! No wonder my legs were bad ass when I was taking those hard core ballet classes. Even judo has nothing on an advanced ballet workout. I need to start doing that after I get home from the gym at least every other night. Get those legs back, man!  Dance and fitness, thats the theme of today's blog I think. Wait, its the theme of all blogs.   Tomorrow I have a dance practice for the Jersey Village Gold Duster reunion Spring Show, from 8AM TO 5PM!! If I'm there that long, I better be doing some bad ass stuff. I don't want to be there and do something like "turn, turn, turn, step, turn, turn, turn, JAZZ HANDS!" But anyways, tonight I will go to my mom's and stay there so I don't have to wake up at some un-godly hour. And tonite, I will also go to 24 Hour Eye Candy and do some lifting. Lets me gaze upon the hotness one more time. ^_^   Last night I was at the lab from 11pm to 1am. And guess what, I was not the last to leave. Ping came in around 11:30pm and was working when I left. Of course, its about 10:15am now and she still isn't in yet. So came in an hour late myself. Thanks to the living close, this is an option now. Yay!  NORTH CAROLINA!! FUN! WATER! MAN!  My grandma and grandpa are moving to Houston this summer!! This weekend my dad is going to Mississippi to start bring home some of the smaller furniture and help clean out the house they are in right now. I told him to bring me a few night stands/end tables and cool stuff that they otherwise would throw away. Also, my grandma does alot of painting, and if he finds any with bold colors, like burgundy, hunter, and navy, to bring them for my walls, which are pretty bare. (I'm trying to steer clear of my kanji posters and japanese prints that adorned my college era homes)   When they finally move in, I will prolly spend so much time there, having grandma teach me more about oil and china painting, and I really want her to teach me some of the southeast asian and indian dishes she learned to cook while she lived in Singapore. And they lived for years in Venezuela, I bet she could teach me some cool South American style things. And grandpa is just hilarious, bright man with a great sense of humor. Sadly, he's in the beginings of Alzheimer's, and he's become less, censured I guess, more lewd than he used to be. Luckily, there aren't any young children around anymore, so we don't have to worry too much about that, and the rest of us understand the predicament and are old enough to just let it all slide. He's, what, 85 now?   It was bound to happen. Other than that he's still healthy. Most Alzheimers patients see the startings around their late 60's, early 70's, so he's really led a great life. They say that the more you excersize your thinking capacity the more it puts off such sorts of mental diseases. He has his PhD in chemical engineering, and worked well into his 70's. If anyone works their mental prowess late into life, it's him.   Yeah, if you can't tell, I think my grandparents rock.

      I feel like writing some haikus. Here you go!  Step out the front door.  Feeling the sun warm your face. Jump into the pool.   I need a swim suit! Clothes are not good for the pool.  Get out and dry off.   I'll go to Target. But I get hungry instead.  I want some sushi.   There ya go! No, thats not what I'm doing at work, that was my lunch break, thank you very much.   The  entire morning  has been spent ordering things for the lab and looking for equipment that we need and can't seem to find. I wanted to finish my assay in the morning so I could plot it all out on Excel. Excel is my bitch. Looks like nope, maybe I'll be staying late, I hope not.   Oh, wait, I can't stay late, I have to be home from 6-8 for the cable guy to install my internet. Yay for internet at home!! Now I just need to de-stupidfy my computer. New virus software, I'm kinda scared what it might find... but I need it.   Okay, back to work. Just wanted to share my poetry with you!

      I'm all moved into my new apartment now. Thanks to Russel, Ginger and Neel, the move was quite painless I think. Neel gave me a futon that he had, so now I have a sort of couch, and they bought me a blender so yay party time! People will have to come over and break in the place! ^_^  I'm so happy with this place, there is more room even with all my stuff in there than I thought there would be. I still have the whole Eastern Fusion theme going on in the decorating, between nick-nacks from Japan, various Asian styled gifts, and the more Indian styled peices of cloth I have draped various places. I need to think of a good name for my place. I have been playing with the name "Adobe del Amor" but thats a bit misleading for the decorating inside. But hell, why not?   As packed as my efficiency was, not so much here. I could use some artwork or a large print in the living room area, but other than that, the main are is pretty much finished. I think that I have a TV, VHS and possibly DVD player coming my way, and I get internet tomorrow evening so that will complete the effects. But my bedroom is a desert right now. I hav emy bed and a bookshelf. I put the dresser and hamper in one of the closets (which is huge!) in an effort the hide the mess that my clothes usually become. I could use a little drawer thingie on one or both sides of my bed and perhaps a full length mirror? I dunno, maybe just more art. I keep reading these things that say "less is more".    I got to go to work at around 10pm Sunday night. Blech. I left near 1am, and got to bed around 2am. So, needless to say, I went into work a bit later the next day. I got in around 10am. After waking the entire way there, and I was exhausted. All day, So tired. I went home for lunch cause I forgot to pack, and yeah, its nice that I can do that.   I need to find a gym, I just printed out a free 10 day pass to at 24 Hour closest to my apartment. We'll see how that goes and if they are eligable for the "24 Hour Eye Candy" name. ^_^ I have a feeling that my old gym will be the best for that.   Okay, onto work.

      So long, Hotness. Toodles, Pretty Young Thing. Was good to see you, Beauty. I may never know who you are, Yearbook. Yesterday was my probably last day at the 24 Hour Fitness at Jones and 1960. I did a pretty good chest workout, and Orlando was kind enough to spot me on the bench. I noticed that once I stopped wearing the headphones around people talked to me more. Perhaps they make me look too unaproachable? At any rate, I will find a gym near my new place, maybe on the weekends I will go to the 24 hour near Madre's until that pass runs out. Gibble.   My chin and "Hindi zit" place are breaking out, so it must be near that time. Damn the man.

      I wrote a post last nite, then IE pooped out on me and it got erased. Blast! So here I go...  First, I have to say that I like the author of the urlLink South Beach Diet . This is a smart, level headed guy.   I finished all the lease paperwork for my new apartment. I'm so excited! my own place, paid for with my own money, I'm kinda scared. Excited scared. Hehe, its "doki doki" in Japanese, we don't have a word for that in English as far as I know.... Anyways, I dunno how I'm going to decorate. I don't have much except the things I've picked up in Japan and things others have given me. I want to go to the Indian district and see if I can get some cool, hopefully cheap, sari material to put around.  Man called yesterday at work. ^_^ He was going to go to Maui with several friends for his birthday, but they can't coordinate it between when everyone can get off and go, so now he it thinking about going back to North Carolina to kite board and hang. He threw out the idea that I could meet up with him either in Florida, or in North Carolina now. I think I would rather do NC because its supposed to be so pretty and there might be more to do than just the beach. I hope he'll teach me some kite boarding. Plus, it will be later in the month, so I will be more settled into the apartment and have more time to get back my swimsuit body. Hehehe. Like I had back in September/October. Must get that back.....   I really want to see him again. Everytime we get to talk on the phone, I'm like aahhhh!   I'm kicking the Starbucks habit. For the past 1.5 months, everymorning I would stop in there and get a tall bold coffee with hazelnut of the day and a low fat muffin or reduced fat coffee cake. Not only did it cost me about $4 a day, but thats just alot of empty calories. So now I've started bringing a snack protein bar, Zone or Balance, to work. So when I get in, I make a cup of tea and have a protein bar. This is working so far, but its only day two. Plus,there isn't a Starbucks on the way from my new apartment. Well, there is, but I would have to get off the bus and get back on and yeah, won't do that anyways.   NEW APARTMENT! YAY! I EVEN GET A POOL VIEW FROM MY LIVING ROOM! You know, I wanted to get an efficiecy when I first moved home, but now I'm really glad that I'm getting a 1/1. Maybe I'm growing up? NO! *sigh* I might have to give into that eventually. But I think I held onto the efficiency idea as a way to hold onto my undergrad-ness.  I'll grow up, but I won't get old. ^_~   I'm finally getting to all these things that have been hanging over my head. I need to get my taxes in the mail, along with the letters of recommendation, and my insurance payment. Blech. Good though, cause work has been kinda of slow lately. I need to find a post office near here where I can send the insurance thing ASAP.   Time Break  I just returned from the post office, got off a few of the things I needed to do. next is just the letters of recommendation, I need to fill in the spot where it asks for the break down of the GRE scores I got, and those numbers are at home. You know, I didn't do bad on the GRE, possibly enough to get some money, but I really could have done better. There is no point in taking it again, unless Dr. Safe asks me to, cause it costs so much. Stupid pride.   I'm so hungry, I ate my end of the day snack bar. Now what am I going to do when I have to go home?? I might break down and have a muffin, no!! I can starve until I get home.... maybe. But my stomach was pissed, and I knew that my little ham sandwich in the cold room wasn't going to satiate that alone. its okay, its just another 150 calories.... and protein!  Well, perhaps I should do some work now. This afternoon I will seed some cells and see how the new DMSO holds up. This means that I get to come in on Saturday. You know, maybe I'll start it tomorrow so I only come in on Sunday.... but thats Mom's birthday. I dunno, we'll see.     Only read further if you want to hear me rant about my last blog more!! Consider yourself warned!!    I certainly started some gossiping the other day with my last blog entry, so I might as well say it all as I heard: My ex is getting a semi-arranged marriage to this girl in Korea that he knew from 5th grade. I find this funny because 1) He always used to say that he could never date, much less marry, a Korean girl because of the way they act, so self conscience, and self-made divas. 2) He used to make no-so-nice comments about how all his friends will go visit Korea for a month and come back with a girlfriend. He used to complain that the girls just want a guy here in America and the guys are too scared to try to find a girl here. 3) I've heard him talk about this girl before and I've never heard him speak of her in a very... respectable?... way. Hardly affectionate, thats for sure.   But then again, it all makes perfect sense. He needs to have a girlfriend, I think its an image thing? But he also doens't want to have to deal with all the trappings of a relationship. So this is really the prefect arrangement for him. Also, I know that he went to Korea about a month after we split, so that probably was when the ball started to roll. Perhaps he went again over Christmas and they had it all worked out. Who's to say. Talk about rebounds  Its just the most ridiculous and absurd thing I've ever heard. It confirms my beliefs about him and disgusts me. I can't believe I wasted a year and a half on him. Its just so desparate.   He always the one to take the easy way of things anyways. Only likes things that are set up for him and if things don't work out well, throws in the towel. I remember he tried to tell me and friends that he was going to take a trip to Europe with the money he saved. I knew he wouldn't. He went to Korea. Duh, he's never been to Europe, its out of his safety zone. He tried to say that he would go to Germany for his military thing he wanted to do. Yeah, right. Once again, its out of his safety zone. I bet anything he will go to, you guessed it, Korea. He spent a good half of his life here in America, convincing everyone that he feels more American than Korean, that he connects better with Americans and all that B.S. Well, wether that was true in the past, like when I met him, I don't know, but he's certainly not that way anymore.   He lost alot of the things about him that I found so interesting. The whole love of live and sense of adventure, the outgoing, extroverted personality, the humor, its all been lost somehow. Its like he's, what ever age he is now, going on 75 and grumpy about it. And he used to hold himself as some sort of moral standard. Used to wear his Christianity like a badge. Then he would go and act out on pride, judging and dismissing my friends as immoral, try to make me feel guilty of going out to bars with my friends, assume things about me with no basis for it. Hipocritical? Oh my word, he was the worst. And during the course of his college career, you know when you grow up and learn to be on your own, he's become more of a mama's boy than anyone I've ever met. And I even told him so when we were dating. Blech. Cut the cord already.   Like I said, it took me less than a week to learn how sweet life was without him around. I've stayed friends with all my exes except him. I think that says something. Only generally good guys are worth my time.

      I SIGNED A LEASE!! I'll be living at Blair House on Bellaire, number 511, first floor, one bedroom apartment, all mine. Moving in this coming Saturday! Yeah! So for all in Houston on the 17th, you can help me move!! Fun times, yay!! I'm so excited/scared about it all. Finally out on my own, supporting myself, I hope it all turns out well. ^_^   Man called last night, cause he finally got a signal on his phone. Talking to him is great, he's got a very calming voice. Next stop, visiting him in Florida next month, probably. I need to get away for a bit, this is perfect timing.   I saw Under the Tuscan Sun with Ashley today. That is something I could almost see my self doing. Just buy a place in another country and move. Screw the US. ha! Well, let me get my PhD first.   Some interesting information was brough to my attention today. It shocked me, brought back a flood of old, angry, spiteful, and just "let me go out and hurt someone severly" feelings. But it also made me laugh, cause this situation that I learned of is so..... perfect. It confirmed everything about someone that I always knew to be true. I now know that my beliefs were well founded, right on the dot. Its almost poetic justice, cause I always somehow knew this is how things would turn out. I'm shocked I guess cause I didn't think it would happen so soon, given especially the level of depression denial this person lives in.   Talk about rebounds.   Poetic justice. So why do I want to kill? Cause it brought back memories of my biggest, probably my only, regret in life. The biggest waste of time. A year and a half long period where I gave up so much and got shit in return. Even the "learning experience" that it gave me doesn't make up for the fury. It's really the only relationship I regret. Its the only  thing  I regret. Ever. And the reminder of that just brings it all crashing back.   I mourned him for maybe,  maybe , a week. Ever since I knew that I'm a better person, I always have been a better person, without him.

      Yeah, thats right! The day may be grey, and the rain can taunt me, but my highlighters are pretty. There are eight of them, arranged from orange to green.   No, i just switched them to match the visible color spectrum.  Yesterday, I didn't get out of work until 6:30!! I didn't get home until after 8! Needless to day, I didn't go work out. I was starving. I was tired. I was frustrated.   I'm going to hit the books. I printed out some Spanish lessons from the computer. I need to put my Japanese lessons in something not so bulky. I spent lunch today reading over Spanish grammar.   My nails are growing! I put a nail hardener on them and it seems to be working. It feels weird to type. My hands actually look like the belong to a girl for once. That will all change if I start fighting again. If? No, when.   I finished all my cell stuff for today, so I think I will leave at 5 to make up for staying late yesterday. So nasty outside. Oh, but I can't wait to get on the rail or the bus to read my book! Angels and Deamons, by the same guy that wrote "Da Vinci Code". Just excellent. I probably will read his other mystery novels too, he writes so intellegently, they are very well researched novels.   I just spent about 20 min looking at a physics website. Whats wrong with me. I hate all things math, and that includes physics.   You  know what, i'm outta here. (cause I'm DOUG!)

      Gibble-ness.   During my workout yesterday, my MD Player wire got caught on something, and the jack just broke off in the plug-in place. I tried to just switch out my head phones, but the inside of the jack seems to be messed up and the only way the left side will play is if I push the plug in or push it to the side. I just bought the thing! Its okay, there is a one year warranty, but I have to ship it to Sony and sit around and twiddle my thumbs. Grrr....  I forgot to change the time on my alarm clock. I woke up at 7:00 instead of 6:00 today. Mom was long gone. Thanks for waking me, buddy. So I got into work late, and I decided that I need to do my experiement in the afternoon since I have to come in to finish it on the weekend, but in the afternoonthe hood is always full. I shouldn't have gone to the class, I prolly could have done the stuff then, right after lunch. Oh well, I'm here typing, waiting.....  I'm rather proud of one accomplishment today. I added a "Spanish Word of the Day" towards the bottom of my side bar. So even if I don't update, there is something new for you guys to check out. ^_^ It took me forever to figure out how to get it in the right place, it kept wanting to be at the very bottom of the page. And seeing as how I think computers and html is all witchcraft.....  I never got to talk to Man last nite. We chatted ever so breifly online before he was like "I just got back from the gym, I need to eat something. I'll be right back" and I never heard from him again. Damn the man, in both ways. ^_^   I think tomorrow I'm going to test run a judo practice right after work. I'll get to my car and head straight over to Diamondback and see what time I get there. Just as a test run. I'll take my gi and all, and an extra sandwich, but I have a feeling I could never get there any earlier than 7:30, and the practices are from 7-9. I need to find a place around the med center/ rice area. I think there is a group that practices at UH, I'll have to ask Spencer, I think he practiced with them once. It prolly is just a better bet to start fighting again once I move.   In the mean time, I need to get my brain back into shape. I've gotten slack on what I once loved to do: study languages. I could possibly do that during my ridiculously long commute. One way could be Spanish, the other way could be Japanese. I keep saying I'm gonna really start studying, but I never do. Grrr....   Same with the whole lose weight, get buff thing. My mentality isn't in the right place.   Laters.

      I finally went to work out, and I saw Hotness for a breif moment, in his special little trainer's cubicle thing. So now I know which one is his. I actually think I made eye contact, but not enough to count. Like, I looked over and he was looking my way, if not at me, so I paused then noticed the floor. Dammit!!   There is another body there I like to peek at every now and then. Too young I think. (what? that didn't stop me in the past, you say?) So let's call him Pretty Young Thing. Not particularly interested in making contact with this one, just some nice scenery, I would say.   There is a guy I KNOW I went to high school with, but his name evades me. Perhaps I'll pull out a yearbook and find him. He's made himself some nice arms, he has. I'll call him Yearbook for now, untill I figure out what his name really is. Then perhaps I'll say hi, just friendly-ness like.   I don't talk to people at the gym. I make it such a business event for me. Perhaps I wouldn't skip like I have been if I could just be a more gregarious person.   Another reminder, NO MORE CHIPOTLE!! Roar! And I talked all of a few lines to Man before he was like "I need to eat something, I"ll be right back." But he's not back. And I absolutely need to ask him about his buddy picture. Haha, not really. This Friday I look for apartments. Keep fingers crossed. *eep!*  Okay, I'm going to bed, I have to work and all. Blah.

      Lazy weekend all together. I'll go to the gym again tonite, though. It's been two days. Whats become of me!?!?!  Ashley, Ken and I tried to go salsa dancing on Friday night, but there was some concert going on and they wanted $35 to get in. Like hell. So we left. We ended up at City Streets, which could be cool, but wasn't. Its huge, but there isn't enough conienant parking (or maybe it was the particular night) so it seemed really empty. The crowd was around 45 years old. For me and my fellow 23yr old peeps, that seems ancient. Watching these people out and "getting it on" on the dance floor was wholey unappealing. These guys we kept laughing at had this thing with (there are a cage on a platform thingie) propping their leg up on something as they danced "suggestively" with their lady. We also got to meet a lesbian who likes cherries.   Saturday was a day of lounging bliss. Ashley stayed the night, in the morning we went to get pedicures. They had to use a friggin' razor to cut off the callouses on my feet. GROSS!! Yeah, its all the dance and judo. Well, I never knew you could actually feel things through the bottoms of you feet. I'm going to invest in one of those, I hope they have them at Walmart. ^_^   Then we went to see "The Prince and Me". I'm sure you've seen the previews. Well, Ashley is now in love, has yet another man on her list. Go find pics of Luke Mabley, apparently he is the hottest thing on the silver screen now. I don't see it. He's rather... ahhhh..... white? He could be my brother.   Quick clarification: when I say I don't date guys that look like my brother, I don't mean that they look like Clark. Not many people look like Clark. I mean, they look like they  could  be my brother. As in, they are white enough that if I were walking along with them, I could say "Oh, this is _____, he's my younger/older brother." And it would be conceivable. So its just that it rules out many fair-skinned males.   So anyways. After pedicures and princes, we went to Starbucks at a Barnes and Nobles, I bought "Angels and Demons" the prequel to "Da Vinci Code". Then we perused Bath and Body Works (I want a candle that smells like the air in that store), then took at least an hour to wander around Cost Plus World Market. I LOVE that place. I'm hoping that I'll have some spare money after I move in, after all the deposits, to get some of the neat little thing I saw there.   After that, we went home and she had to go off to see Niko, her.... ex-step dad? They still hang out, and thats good for him I suppose, but it seems kinda taxing on Ashley, she is so busy and all.   Today I went to church, took a nap, went to work, read my book and munched on pop corn outside, ate dinner, and I will go work out. Will Hotness be there? There is no telling.   The whole meeting with Man in North Carolina doesn't seem to be working out. Now he is saying he will be in Florida in May and I could meet up with him there. I checked flights, and they are only about $11 more into Miami than into Raleigh. So yeah, I really want to. It kinda depends on when I sign my lease to start, moving in and all that jazz. I really would love to move in the same day as the dance show reunion. That way I have the rest of the month to settle in and then i definately could meet him up in Florida.   Then again, I wonder every now and then, why am I willing to work so hard for a guy that I spent all of .... 10 hours?... with and really, after this possible Florida trip, when will I see him again. Its not like you can really start a relationship with someone when you have no clue when, how long, or even IF you'll get to be together again. Plenty of people are in distance relationships, but they usually start out in at least a closer place to get the foundation laid. Plus, they can make ways to see each other on at least a semi-regular basis. He's extremely busy, constantly all over the country on sevice calls and business, and I'm too poor to go meet up with him more than once every, say, four months maybe? He really does seem like such a great guy, so smart, adventurous, secure, healthy, cute, and all that. How hard should someone fight against odds for a person that seems wonderful until it kinda becomes wasted effort? I know it hasn't reached that yet. I just am venting, don't want to invest too much emotion in something that could distract me from my current situation that turns out to just be a pipe dream.   I'm going to go to Walmart, get another pair of my favorite workout pants, look for a callous cutting razor, and some lotion. Then I'm going to go lift. I need to lift.   Chipotle has been single handedly underminding my entire diet I think. One burrito (Rice, beans, pell peppers, chicken, lettuce, cheese) has 1165 calories.  A bowl with lettuce, chicken, beans, bell peppers is around 350. Yeah, seriously. Never again.   Time to get buff and cut. I need to thin out again. Laters.

      The GRE taught me that my vocabulary is in shambles. As a member of the female species, I should be able to communicate and have abetter grasp of language than most of the male species. This just isn't true for me. I have a few things I beleive attribute to this. One is that a good percentage of my friends are male, and therefore my verbosity has declined to their level. Second, as a B.S. in genetics, there was no emphasis put on language classes what so ever. The last English/ Literature class I took was in high school. Third, with my continous study of other languages, I think the more academic words of my vocabulary have been pushed aside to make room for the basic vocabulary and alphabets of these other languages. My time in Japan did not help the situation.   So in an effort to regain control of my mother tongue, I have taken to reading the NY Times in the morning. Of course, I also frequent my free online Spanish and Japanese language sites as well.   I just read this article talking about that old TV show "My So-Called Life" and comparing it to current teenage drama shows like "O.C.", "Dawson's Creek", and "One Tree Hill." The article sound like its praising these new shows because it protrays teens as how they see themselves. I say "Okay, teens see themselves as loose, perfect, and completely in control of everything. They also see their parents as evil witches and warlocks." Riiiight, thats how I saw myself in high school. Please. During my mid-teen years, I love that show "My So Called Life", I could relate to it. The characters were shy, and akward at times, confident at others, they didn't always know what to do, they struggled. They had fights with their 'rents, but they also had times of friendship with them. Teens can  relate  to that. It was real, these other shows, they are ridiculous. I can't stand them. BAH! Moving on.    urlLink NOOOO!!!  Why! Keep fighting the good fight! Shoot, I would use Linux if I wasn't so lazy to change and learn. *sob*  Once again, Man, if you read this, I'm sorry.   I doubt he does, he's never said anything so I think I'm safe. ^_^   That awesomely cut woman was at the gym again. Inspiration. I want to get back to my last September shape. I was so much easier then, I was busy all day, but it wasn't like commuting for three hours busy. Being actually busy is a good diet. Then having your own apartment is a good diet, cause I don't buy the snacks my mom does. College judo teams are good diets, cause everyone supports each other for making weight. (Of course, then they make fun of you for looking too skinny.....)   FitDay.com, I'm going to try to use this to keep track of things. Maybe that will help.   Its almost 9:30am here, where is everyone?? I know the boss isn't in today, but he never is. Sheesh.   Okay, bathroom break. Late, kids.

      I think we need to have a moment of silence in order to reflect on how extremely awesome ninjas are. And if you are unsure on this point, let me lead you to a site that explains the facts:  urlLink The Official Ninja Webpage   Now thats over with, moving on....  Judo. Its not just a sport. Its a way of life.   I've started going back to judo classes this week at Diamondback. I'm not as sore as I expected, though I am a bit bruised. But only on the outside. And already, my attitude towards life has changed. Its as though the mentality and the theories that make judo work permeate through to other aspects of my life. Since I stopped training last November (mostly due to a mysterious injury to my back) I've become something of a sloth, uninterested in the things around me, complacent about life, and, well, a straight up sloth about stuff. And already I'm feeling my old self start to come back.   I never thought that it had that kind of control over me. I thought that for the most part, yes, it was an obsession, but still just something that I did. All that talk about how martial arts are supposed to teach you about life and influence your action in all aspects, well, I thought "thats cool in theory, but come on, really now..." Well, shit. Maybe those talkers are right.   I'm more focused at work. When there is something to be done, I do it. Procrastination, I still do it, but it had become ridiculously out of control. At them gym, though I can't go as often now because of training, I've got a new found engergy for it. There is a new reason for the lifting and the cardio. The payback will be on the mat, rather than just in the mirror.   And I just feel better about myself. My general happiness level has gone way up. I feel like no one can touch me. I'm not dwelling on things that had me down as little as a week ago.   And I can kick your boyfriend's ass.   With that said, I will finish my dinner and hit the gym. Today is legs!

      Yes, I have no pants. A perk of living alone.   I'm adding a link to my brother's Live Journal, though I will call it a blog. Aren't they all, after all? Oooh, a live journal. Do you keep in in cage with food and water? Well, mine kicks ass cause I can change the layout. Blah! No. BLOG!   Anyways, he has some interesting things to say every now and then, and if you like my writing style at time, you're gonna be floored by him.   I wonder if he gets to take the mice into space? Hmmmm....

      Yeah, so this little sister of the Jessica Simpson has come out with a new song called "Peices of Me". What the hell?? I was here first, I want to set that straight. In fact, you can see the song from which I got the title quoted at the bottom of this page. Tori Amos, thank you very much. Sheesh.   In other news, I went to a judo practice last nite at  urlLink Diamondback Judo . It was me and, oh, seven other middle aged men who kicked my ass. ^_^ I miss being beaten up so much. Ha! I like to think that I held my own pretty well for not having practiced since last November. I do know this though, I need to drink a ton more water on days that I plan on going to practice. It was more expensive to join, monthly rate wise, than I expected, but for 6 hours of practice a week, still cheaper than 6 hours of dance a week at any studio.   I also got my Spanish and Japanese computer programs, with the microphone headsets, in yesterday. I'm so excited. I think I'm gonna go be all "spiffy" and take my laptop to Starbuck and load it all after my workout. Time to look like a techno-nerd. I doubt I'll actually start, I prolly don't need to talk in tounges to my computer if I want people to approach me. Ha!  My fingers hurt from judo, I've lost all the callouses on the backs of my knuckles. Thats prolly the most sore part of my body right now. I'm not that bad off, but I didn't stay for the open fighting. If I had, I wouldn't have gotten out of bed. I might stay this Thursday. Hell, yeah, I'm going back!  Hedeesh is back from California. Its Crazy Time!  This weekend I want to go to this sari store on Hilcroft by Hwy 59. Who wants to come with me. I don't want to be the lone white chic browsing the Indian store. There is also a clothing store in the same center that looks interesting. Give me a ring.   Today, I eat at the Waterfall Building. Today, I hope to see some nice eye candy. Today will be a good day, I can just feeeeeel it.

      I have a confession to make. I contacted him again. Sad, but true. I sent an email stating "Its been nearly two weeks and I haven't heard anything from you. I left a voice mail when I got back to Houston and have sent two emails. Just let me know that you are getting the emails and I'll stop bugging you."   Well, he responded saying. "Hi. Yeah, I'm fine. Just busy. Just flew into San Fransisco. Going kiteboarding!" You're fine? I didn't ask you if you were fine or not. At this point I'm mad, and I don't care if you are fine or not. Busy? Its impossible for me to beleive that anyone is so busy they can't take 5-10 minutes to respond to emails. And given the lenght of his past replies, 5 minutes tops.   More bullshit from yet another guy. When will the insanity end? I guess when I resign myself to being single and happy about it.   But now, being me and all, its been much easier on me since he was the last write. Cause, in a way, now its me doing the ignoring. So, bite me.   In other news, Clark came in last Friday and we ate sushi at The Blue Fish House on Westheimer. It was really good! The prices were reasonable too. I would definately go back if anyone else is up for some sushi!! Speaking of food, there is a Middle Eastern buffet that is supposed to be just fabulous in the same shopping center as City Streets. So if anyone is up for a "Flavor Adventure", let me know, we go there.   Then After the sushi, Clark proceeded to pass out on my futon and drool on my new throw pillows. Oh well. Ginger and Neel came over and the four of us chatted over white russians and sour apple martinis. Yup, in my place, no room for Bud. Once they all left, I pretty much passed out.   Saturday I starte laundry at my mom's, ate lunch with my dad, got my phone software updated and a new battery for it, and hung out a bit at my dad's new house. Then we went to eat at this Mexican restraunt and I got this amazing chicken thing grilled in white wine. You could actually still taste the wine flavor, a first for me. Then they (Dad and Marilyn) wanted to go to Walmart, and that was an hour excursion.   Finally I went back to my mom's house and crashed there cause it was late. Sunday was a full day. Mom and I went to Walmart, got me some little tables for my bedroom with table clothes, I set her toaster on fire, I got my car cleaned out, we bought way too many bagels and then went to the mall. I got there a pair of khaki cargo capris on sale, and a cargo style skirt, also on sale. Yay. Then I got us a couple of smore flavored coffees at Gloria Jeans.   After that, I packed up my clothes and went to meet Theo and his friends at La Strada on Westheimer. A balconey dance club for Sunday afternoon. Many gay and fabulous men there. I met several of his old martial arts friends, they are all crazy, it was great. I also drank too much mimosa (Sunday afternoon, people!!). They went on to another party at someone's house, but I went home cause I eventually had to go into work that night. Well, I was a bit "happy" so I got Starbucks chai and Chinese food. I dunno, it seemed to qualify itself at the time.   I have made a decision to start back into judo. Brian, one of the guys there, said that around 6:30, it should only take me about 30-35 mins to get to diamond back from the Bellaire area, and that is the place he says he would recommend the most. So tomorrow I will go out there and check it out, see about prices and all that. I'm not used to having to pay for judo, so this could come as a shock to me.   At work, I finished my last day of WST for the inhibition assay. Wasn't working to begin with so I wasn't too, you know, whatever about it. After I did the reading, Ping and I "fixed" this bubble "Aquascape" thing that Ismael had left behind with various things around the lab. Once we got it working and decently decorated, it was after midnight and I went home and crashed.

      I just added more things to my Blogger sidebar. Check it! I added Addie's blog, cause she started one and I found it. Ha ha! I hope you don't mind. ^_^ She left a comment on one of my previous posts, whoo-hoo! Go you! She has reminded me that "There are plenty of fish in the sea, and they all stink." Well, I'd have to agree with ya. Seeing how guys just like to dissappear and/or leave you with no warning, well, they can bite me. I need a cat.....  I also added a nice little quote, that I think I also picked up from Addie somewhere along the way.... maybe her profile on AIM? Who's to say?  Then, below that, is my Palabra del Dia. Thanks to the stylings of the new template, all I had to do was paste in the html and it fit itself to the area provided. It took me nearly all day to format the last blog template to get it all to fit right. Now I just need to find a "Nichi no Kotoba" and I'll be all set!   Darbiness and Preachaman are in town today I beleive. I'm hoping to hang with them.   I went to Starbuck today, yes, I broke down and needed a muffin. Not the same as the low fat ones at Sweet Eugenes, no one beats there. I wish they would become a chain, places need more coffee shops like that. Houston does for sure. All of the good ones are on Westheimer towards Montrose, and they all close around 11pm or 12am. What?!?! Yeah, I like being able to come back from the gym, shower, and hit up a cafe to study or read until 2am. Thats the life.  It's getting friggin' hot. What the heck?!?!   Well, they finally blew up the building across the street, now I can look outside and see tree tops and the rooves of Rive U. I love buildings that use Spanish tile. I dunno, its just classier looking that thats ugly shingle crap.   More to come later, I'm sure. I haven't hit the NYTimes yet today.

      I have found my dream home, condo actually, in New York. Check it out  urlLink HERE ! Absolutely beautiful. Too bad its nearly 3 million to buy. Some day I'll have a place like this, right? Well, its a five bedroom, 2 bathroom loft, so if four other of you people would like to go for it in say, oh, 10 years, lets move to New York!! They have any type of industry there you would want to work in, no problem!   As long as I'm dreaming, I'd like a pony.   I reading the New  York Times again, which means you are about to hear me rant and spout off stuff that I really don't know that much about, but deal with it. ^_^  Okay, first, I'm reading that the New York ex-mayor is getting flack for the way he handled the 9/11 tragedy, how all these mistake were made. Um, is it just me or was everyone in that city kinda caught off guard? Its so easy to look back and say, "Oh, this and this should have been done. We could have saved more people if we handled it this way." But, really, please, if we knew ahead of time how to handle such a thing, well we'd be psychic and could have prevented it in the first place. Thats why they say that hindsight is 20/20, cause foresight isn't. Maybe people should start calling Ms. Cleo in the future to stop such things and ask how to handle them. Give me a break.   Then I read about the trials for those people who did the abuse to the Iragi detainees. One guy got the maximum punishment, one year in jail, reduction in rank, a bad conduct discharge. Is that the same as dishonorable discharge? Well, what ever, but if its the maximum, I say YAY. Those asses, the ones who did it and the ones who ordered it (if anyone really did) all derseve to be made examples of. Thanks to them, our country looks like a nation of assholes even more than we already did. They perpetuated and buttressed the impressions that all the other nations have about Americans. Not only that, but geeze, they are HUMANS just like us. Be the bigger man, show them and the world how civilized people treat one another. I makes me sick. Just sick.   Then I read an article about American Idol cause my brain was racing too fast and I needed some dumb distractions.   I'm still in love with the condo.  urlLink  LOOK AT IT AGAIN!!   "Lets go LOOK at it." ~Wanda Sykes on why it must be tough to be a guy.   Wanda Sykes, Dane Cook, Lewis Black, Mitch Hedenberg (sp?), Sinbad; a list of my absolute favorite stand up comics IN THE WORLD!!   Well, I guess thats all for now. Its too early in the morning to say much else other than my coffee is gone and thats just too bad. Oh, and the exterminator is coming by today to go over my apartment. Then perhaps this weekend I will up my level of protection with a sprinkling of Roach Away powder around the cabinets and other such dark areas. Death be to insects.

      So I still haven't heard from the boy. It just seems so wrong, cowardly even, to just let things wither and die. I needed personal closure anyways. Soooo, I sent an email? Just said that "I've kinda stopped expecting a reply anymore. Thanks again for the weekend, it was fun. Enjoy your summer and take care." Oh well, shame, he seemed like a decent guy. Moving on.   I fumed my apartment. Damn six legged spawn of satan are dead. Now I have to go through and clean all my dishes and kitchen counters so I can eat again. I complained to the office on Monday morning, and they said that they will bomb the apartment next to me. Apparently the guy that just moved out officially today hasn't been in there in over a month. There is no telling what condition that place is in. I should call and remind them that I still want to exterminator to go over my place as added protection.   I also finally sent in my grad school application and gave the recommendation letter to Dr. Safe. Well, there ya have it. Just signed the next four years of my life over to Houston. Yippee.   Oh look! The text is wrapping today! Yay!  In College Station, Ashley and I must have spent about two hours looking around World Market. I bought two throw pillows and another died sari type sarong cloth for the window in my bedroom. I'm sticking to the whole Asian Fusion theme my apartment has going. Its all good, its starting to look like a real apartment rather than an overgrown dorm room sort of place. I just need some things for the walls and that fake tree I keep talking about.   Work is going well, as soon as the tissue culture hood is free I need to hop in there and get to town on my next set of experiments. I might have to come back in tonite, though I really don't want to.   I just bought on Ebay a Spanish language program that comes with a microphone so that it can compare your voice to native speakers. I'm so excited. I'm thinking that everyday during dinner or after the gym I can work on it a little. I really want to learn. And Kenteshia and Hedish want to learn this summer too, so we can all be Spanish speaking fools come fall.   I really don't want to come back into work tonight. I want to start cleaning up the apartment after the bombing. Then again, if the exterminator comes tomorrow, well, I might as well hold off on the cleaning until then. *sigh*  Clark is coming to Houston this weekend! Yay! Party time! Well, not really but yeah. When he finally moves into his new apartment, I'm gonna rope off a Kristin Space there and use him as a launching pad to explore that city. And the surrounding country side.   I need a nap. I didn't have any coffee today, so my afternoon reserves have been depleted by morning activity. G'nite....

      Okay, there is this spiffy little comments thing at the end of posts now, where you can give me feedback on things. Yeah, let me konw what you think about things. Advice? Comments. Nan demo ii. Ken wins for leaving the first comment, so lets all be winners and comment. ^_^  Blogger is still doing the weird anti-wrapping thing in the edit window. Whats up with that? What ever, ya know? What ever! Thats my mantra these days. Heh.   SO this apartment is infested and I'm DISGUSTED!! A  roach  woke me up in the middle of the night. And those little fuckers are fast. EW! Ew! Ew! Ew!  EW!  So MONDAY I will call the office and be like "Yeah, I need that exterminator desparately!" Ugh!   I ended up sleeping on the futon for the rest of the night with the lights on cause I hear that roaches don't come out into the light hardly ever.   Today I go to College Station and rehash everything with Ashley about the weirdness that is Man. Not Man as in Mankind, thats a given, but Man as is that guy that I  thought  was so into me. I feel duped. Of course, I've already come to the conclusion that he's outta the picture. Once again, out of nowhere.   I've determined also that he very well may be a personality much like another particular ex. One of those awesome people, intelligent, humourous, adventuresome, and really extroverted, the exact type that really draws me in, but then a tendency towards self centeredness that basically ruins any chance of me putting up with for an extended period of time. Sucks.   I'm still pissed that i've miss placed my pictures CD. Maybe its in my Mom's computer for some reason. I think that at one time I tried to read my picture CD in her computer and it didn't work. Did I leave it there? We'll find out later. I"ll have to drop by after CS to maybe do laundry and look.   I think I'm gonna go across the street to Cafe TimTin and get some greasy Chinese food. ^_^ Talk to you fools later.   Leave a comment!

      Well, it's Saturday night and I just got home from watching Cinderella by the Houston Ballet with my mom. It was beautiful. And you know what? Still no call from Man.   No call. No message. No e-mail. Nothing. Since Monday when I left the East Coast.   I think he's throwing me the deuce.   Hence the title here.   Cause, as we all know, no one says it like Missy. Tori Amos says it sometime, but you gotta figure it out. I consider Missy Elliot to be Kurt VOnnegut of rap and hip hop. Tori Amos is more of a modern day, oh, Shakespeare?  Okay, Blogger is doing this weird thing where it isn't wraping the text like normal in the space where I type. It's really weirding me out, these are all really long lines here. I hope it looks right when I post.   Well, my head hurts, I'm not sure why. I'm gonna hit the sack.

      Its Friday. The last that I heard from Man was a message on my phone Monday around 11am. Since then, I left a reply message, left messages on his MSN Messenger, and emailed him the pictures of the weekend that I posted online. No reply. Is the ball in his feild, or is there even a feild in these things?  Now, granted, during a project, and in the days, even a full week, after his return, he tends to be very busy and rather stressed.   I've been freaking out for the past four days about my behaviour in North Carolina (reserved) and wondering if I'm floating belly up in this whole thing. But Kenteshia reminded me that I can't float belly up cause my stomache would blind people so that would be kinda rude.   But I've been thinking, (yes, again) and this is what I've come up with:  if he can dicount me that easily, then so be it .  Cause really, I wasn't like that on the phone with him, I wasn't like that at the gym, and I wasn't like that when we hung out in Houston. And if he is going to take that one instance and determine his perception of me from there, forgetting the other times we talked and stuff, well, thats too judgemental anyways.   Of course, he might be doing nothing of the sort, and really is just very busy.   So here I am. Cause you know what? No matter what happens from here, be the outcome good or bad, I've got enough to keep me occupied and enough that I'm wanting to pursue. (Thanks to Ken, I can spell that now.) And its kinda sad, but rejection tends to make me get my butt in gear for other things I've been meaning to take care of. For instance, today I have finally put the final touches on my application, wrote the check, and just need to send it out. Post offices are closed now though.   Cut off contact from me, that's your loss, not mine.   I think Newman is back.   I haven't been to the gym all week. I blame that on the lamentations and meloncholic mood of my post-vacation analysises. I'll hit it up again next week. Maybe Saturday afternoon I will go to 24 Hour Eye Candy and see if a vision of Hotness can lift my spirits a bit more.   BTW,  VENDOR SHOWS ROCK!!!  I went TWICE, count 'em, TWICE yesterday. It was huge! They gave us ice cream, hot dogs, pop corn, and every place had some sort of little freebie to hand out. I got several conicals of M&Ms, some plain, some peanut, some small candies, a mouse pad, samples of cryotubes, filters and pipets (yeah, only me to be so excited about those) a dry erase sheet thing, some stick on clips for walls/ cabinets, a maganetic clip, maganets, a t-shirt with a picture of DNA on it, a timer/watch thing, a binder, several pens and pencils, and these vinyl stickers that say things like "Do you want someone in charge or someone who knows whats going on?" and "I haven't lost my mind, it's back up on disk somewhere."   Fisher packing slips smell like banana peels. Go figure.   I went once with Wei from across the hall, then I went again after lunch with Ping, my partner in crime. It was a ghost town after the hot dogs ran out there. I thought that was funny. So we got left overs and some extra things cause the people were kinda looking to lighten their load of freebies. Thats when i got the DNA shirt. I might wear that tomorrow cause I'm a dork like that.   Different subject. I read an article that says that anywoman over 5'4" is considered tall, and the average guy height is 5'9". So basically, by limiting myself to guys my height and up, I'm cutting my eligible dating pool in about half. Thats a strike against me. Second, in a ranking of 80 cities for dating and singles scene, Houston scored around 75. Thats baaaad for me. A very low number of single people in my age range, very spread out city, and a small number of places, such as coffee shops and the like, to meet and hook up at.   Boooo, thats two strikes against me.   BUT, Austin, our very own heart of Texas, and the T-sip capitol as well, ranked #1 with a perfect score of 100. Ranked high in number of bars, number of coffee shops, number of hook up venues and activities, number of singles in my age range, and amount of money spent at clubs and on alcohol.   Sadly, Seattle rated up there too, and that just made me sad again.   Then I looked back at Austin and thought, "I'm gonna be spending some weekends at my brother's place this weekend, I think." Between him and Rubin, yeah, I need to explore that place.   Okay, more later, toodles.

      Okay, I have already outlined what all happened in that weekend at the Outer Banks. It was an absolute dream, and it should have been absolutely perfect, it really should have. If it weren't for one thing: that I'm an idiot.   The entire time, well most of the time, I was quite, shy and rather introverted. WHATS WRONG WITH ME?!?!?! Here is what I think...  1) I've gotten so used to talking to Man on the phone (which I'm proud of since I'm bad at that) and when I actually saw him there before me, I got all nervous again. Whats that?? I was more animated when I first met him here in Houston! But other things contributed too....  2) I was "out of my element" in a way. I mean this is Hatteras Island, and it seems like the epicenter of kiteboarding. And kiteboarding is  his thing ! So I was all trying to be as accomodating as possible, cause the last thing I want to do is get in the way of his passion and detract him from the reason he was there. I think I over compensated by being too complacent and tagging along without giving any input.   3) There are two sides to me. There is "Newman the Human", and as  human, shoot, I know I'm bad ass. I mean, I work hard at what I do, I'm pretty smart, talented, witty, I have plenty of things going for me and enough to make me an interesting person. I've never had a hard time making friends, and most people that meet me as "Newman the Human" like me. The other side is "Kristin the Female" and, well, she's more introverted, self conscience, shy, emotional, and timid. She is the one that ove analyzes situations, get hurt easily, and is worried about what others think.   Now, given, she doesn't come out very often, but I think that when I'm really starting to feel for someone, she wiggles her way to the forefront of my conscienceness and tells me things like "What makes you so sure he's right for you? What makes you so sure that he even likes you? Look at what he's doing now. Do you think think he would act like that if he was into you?" and things like "Why would you say/act like that? Others will think you are weird. Stop it or you'll say/do something dumb."  Well, he was an angel, and I freaked out.   So all in all, I gave a really bad representation of who I am. Cause I'm so rarely like that. I don't get it. I was so excited, and perhaps its that excitement and sensory overload that set off the chain of mental explosions that shut me up. FRIGGIN'!!!  What does he think? I'm afraid he thinks "This isn't what I remember her being when I was in Houston. This isn't the way she acts on the phone. This isn't the same girl that I was so into." I'm afraid that he's backing off and starting to discount me on not what he thought I was. DAMN IT. Maybe I just think too much, I hope I just think too much.   He did say that the weekend was too short. He did say that "next time" I should come earlier to have more time there. He did say that we need to spend more time together, and that he'll try to make it to Houston for a weekend. Those are good signs, right? He wouldn't just say them to ease my mind and not really mean them, right? DAMN IT!  And it doesn't help that I haven't talked to him since Monday, the day I left. I left a message on his phone on Monday in response to a message he left while I was on the plane. I also left a few messages on his MSN the other day. Yesterday I sent him the link by eamil to where I posted the pictures online. I haven't heard a reply yet. DAMN IT! Now, given, he is on a project in North Carolina, had to have it finished by the end of today I believe, so he could be really busy. So I'm trying, really trying, not to freak out my my apparently immenent self sabotage. Not yet.   It just really sucks, cause, well yeah, he does live across the country from me so the chances of anything working out were slim anyways. But still, as picky as I am, to meet someone and be so drawn to him and him be seemingly equally drawn to me, then for me to go pull a stunt like that. DAMN IT! I'm kicking myself, constantly. Cause slim chance doesn't mean NO chance. The world is alot smaller than it used to be.   And its all my fault, too. Which is also a killer. DAMN IT!  Let me say one more time:  DAMN IT!!

      Okay, everyone wants to know about the Hatteras escapade. First, you can find my pictures  urlLink HERE  and see just what a cutie he is. ^_^ The older guy that took that first picture said we were a "pretty couple". (more smiles)  Second, I'm going to go through what we did.   I arrived a 11:09 in Newport News, VA, he picked me up, and took turns driving us back to Hatteras. It was a three hour drive, so its only fair that I do some of that. So we didn't actually get to the condo he rented until about 2am.   Saturday, we're up early cause thats just how we are. I have Kashi bars that we munch on for breakfast and then we head out to the light house (reference the first four pictures), which is the pride and joy of North Carolina apparently. We climb to the top, where its damn windy, and we go to a museum where it talks about the construction of it and how they had to move it nearly 3000 feet away from the shore because of weathering of the shoreline.   Then we went to Food Lion, picked up frozen meals for lunch and changed to swim suits to hit the beach. He does kiteboarding, if I haven't mentioned that before, and I've never really seen that and, yeah, looks really fun. While he is out, I lounge and take in the sun, read, walk around and wade. Tis quite nice, at one point I realized I hadn't thought about work, money, school, rent or any of that stuff for at least an hour. *happy sigh* The wind picked up like crazy, and his board had it out for him! He's working on jumps and tricks, just learning, and one time he crashed, the board sliced his shoulder and hit the back of his head. Like a golf ball under his skin! But, being the guy that he is, he wouldn't come in. He was having to much fun playing. ^_^  When it all finally wore him out, we heading back home for showers. We went to a nearby restraunt for dinner where they had corn bread! Aint nothing wrong with that. He was all like "but that so many refined carbs" and I'm like "dude, you ate fried chicken last nite." Then we got some mango custard to go, a blanket from the condo, and went out to the beach. The sunset was georgeous! You know how every beach house in Galveston has some painting of a beach sunset in these pastel colors, with beach grass on the shore and birds? I never liked those cause I was always like "sunsets aren't like that!" YEAH they are! Go to some beach with out the Galveston or Houston pollution and you do see that! So we had the custard (so good!), and waited until the sun went away.   Then we swang by the movie theater and got tickets for Van Helsing and headed back to the condo to chill. We watched this show about game show bloopers and laughed our asses off. Van Helsing, I didn't know what it was really about before, seeing as I don't have a TV at home. It was a bit, well, overly gothic for me. Like, there is period gothic such as "Interview with the Vampire", but this was like more grotesque, more exposed women, more unrealistic style gothic I guess. Not bad, just not my style. Its okay.   We went back and chilled. Got some Vitamin E stuff for his cut and he held a frozen water bottle to his head for a bit. He passed out while I was in the shower, poor guy got beaten up.   Sunday. We lounged around in the morning quite a bit. Had mor frozen meals while he looked for a leak in the kite. That was an ordeal, and we didn't find it either. Had to pull this 12 meter bladder out of the kite, pump it up, systematically dunk sections in water and look for bubbles. All for nothing. Oh well, its a slow leak, it'll do anyways.   This day we went to a kire boarding store where he knows, I think everyone there. He didn't get anything cause their system was down, only taking checks and cash. Oh well. So we go out and get lunch nearby. We were going to head to the flight museum where the Wright brothers first had flight. But the wind was starting to come out and he asked me what I wanted to do, and, well, I wanted to learn to kiteboard. So we turned around and hit the beach.   The hardest part, the only part I couldn't get for the life of me, was PUMPING UP THE DAMN KITE! The valves are such that you have to pinch off the valve before you diconnect the pump so it doesn't lose air. You have to pinch hard and close fast, and the pinching wasn't working too well for me. Finally he is like "here, i'll do it for the sake of time". Ugh, I'm such a goon.   So I get all the lines detangled, hooked up, and ready to go. First he straps himself in for me to launch the kite and he can demonstrate how to handle it, first while just standing in the water. Okay, thats all good. Well, so we land it and I try to take launch it. But, partly cause my pumping technique sucked, I couldn't get it into the air for the life of me. He would be like "Hold the bar vertical! Pull back on the left side!" And I was all like "I am!" And I would pull harder but then he's like "Vertical! Vertical!" He ended up having to get it up in the air for me. Not going so well...  Well, Then he hands me the bar and I'm trying to control the thing. At first I'm way oversteering the kite and bite it almost every time. I keep wanting to look at the bar rather than the kite itself and yeah, it was kinda weird at first. There where moments where it pulled on me and I was digging my toes into the sand trying not to move. Once it tugged me and he had to grab the back of the harness and pull me back.   Finally, I got the hang of it. Found a good stance that kept me in one place and figured out how to make the smaller arcs with the kite. Cool, Then he is like, "okay, do body drags, zig zag through the water" Now, that doesn't sound safe. But I did, just picked up my feet behind me and let the wind have its way with me. Well, not really, I figure out how to steer. Then, at that point, I realized how this could be addicting. Gliding through the water like that, then when you change directions of the kite, it lifts you up and you can just feel how much power you could get out of it if you know what you are doing.   So I do that a few times, walk backwards, drag again, walk back, and drag a final time. Now my neck is getting really tired from watching the kite up in the air, so I drag myself towards the shore and land the kite.   Then we pump up the big kite, I was working with the 8 meter one, and hook it up for him to go play. Just as well, cause the wind was picking up and would have made me it's bitch. So he goes out, and I actually take a nap on the smaller kite. Hey, i'm tired, okay, and the sun feels nice. Then I watch him. I take some pictures of him jumping and doing his thing and VDO a bit with his digital VDO camera that is smaller than my picture camera! It's cool, alright. He does some things that cause the kite to eat it and the owner of the beach comes out and kicks him out for be "dangerous".   So we head to where most of his friends go, then they are getting together to go down the island to a launch spot and just ride the wind back to the store. I drive him and drop him off and head back to the destination. I pick up some water and strawberry lemonade on the way. He loves his strawberries. So, when I get back, I can just see all them coming in. It looked really cool,(also in the photo album) to see all the different colors coming in, with the light of the sunset and all. I tried to get a pic of him jumping again, but the foot strap on his board broke and, he had to come in. I was kinda glad cause I was getting cold. *shhhh!*   So we head over to this Chinese restraunt for dinner and a couple show up, friends of his, and we swear they have been stalking us. They were always showing up where ever we were. We all got to talking, and Man told him how I did body drags, and they are all like "all right! thats great!" Apparently, people don't really get to that until their third lesson. So he tells me I learn pretty fast. Except I still dont' know if I can get the kite in the air on my own. We take our food back to the condo to eat, then we go out and look at the stars. It wasn't so clear the nite before, but its georgeous now. We are both pretty tired and have to get up really early, so we get to bed.   The next morning we get up at friggin' 4am. We have to drive the three hours to the airport, then he has to drive back to where he has a meeting for work. Yuck. So I drive to the airport while he dozes and works on some things. I'm so bad at goodbyes. I get my stuff, give him a kiss, hug him twice and am just like "okay... I guess I'll go now. Bye" I go in and get on stand by for the earliest flight I can catch. The rest is boring travel stuff.   Oh, one other thing, he called me around 11, after I turned off my phone for the flight, and left a message that the meeting had been canceled and he could have stayed to kiteboard after all. OH! I would have been livid! They made him change his plans last week to accomodate this meeting! Blech.   Next installment will be my female analysis of the weekend. Which can't be good cause nothing good comes of female style analysis. And why I call myself Self Sabotaged.

      At the gym yesterday, I got my body fat % taken again. Okay, last time it was at 23%, and since I have changed my diet and increased the intensity of my weight training and started doing cardio everyday. I have definately seen the changes in the mirror and have gotten comments and compliments. So I decided that it HAD to have gone down, I was hoping to oh, 20 or 19%. Well, the trainer that did it this time, Corey, he really pinched, not all gently like the last guy did. And he was all like, "yeah, you should be less than 23% this time" and no, his calculations put me at about 24-24.5%!! What? Yeah, according to his techniques, I've gone up. Well, he said its probably because of the differences in the ways he and the other guy did this. he said come back in another month if I want and get either him or Jose to do it, since they do it the exactly same way. He also said that when he takes over other trainer's clients, they usually complain that his results are worse than the last trainers. So, after this weekend, I will stay on this "menu" and workout regimine. Hey, what else have I got to do with my time??  Of course, it won't be easy. Just now, Diana, the secratary for Dr. Safe, handed me a peice of coconut cake and was like "here, i don't want it." I was like "shooooot, thanks" AND I ATE IT!! RIGHT BEFORE I LEAVE FOR A BEACH WITH A SWIM SUIT!! *sigh* I'll have to have one of those low carb salads for lunch to make up for all that refined sugar. And I'll make sure my afternoon snack consists of nuts rather than a meal bar or grain bar.   I'm still psyched that I got my MD player to work again. I switch the hair bands from a thick on to a thin one cause it hold the thing at the right place better. And if I keep it in the arm band holder, that keeps if from slipping out any more.   I got my first sunburn of the summer yesterday. I ate lunch outside. I was sitting with my right shoulder in the sun for about, oh, 15-20 minutes, and later that day I noticed in the mirror that my right shoulder is significantly more red than the other one. Its already gone now, my skin heals pretty quickly, I think.   So after talking to Man last nite, he talked me through what exactly I needed to pack. I'm like "I hope I can fit it all!" and he's like 'No, cut back! cut back!" So I took a serious look at the clothes I was considering packing and yeah, much better now. I can easily fit all the clothes in my smaller duffel bag, and i probably won't need to take the bigger back pack. I probably will cause its cooler looking than my other backpack, and I'm a dork like that.   So this evening is the mad dash to buy last minute things at Target. Snack bars and nuts for the plane ride, batteries for my camera, new nail polish and cotton balls to take the old off, sun block in a major way, my book from the library, and a frozen mean to eat for a quick lunch tomorroe before I leave. My plane rides have "food for purchase" on them, no more are the days of the complimentary in-flight meal. Not that those were very good anyways. Only when you got the sandwiches were they decent I thought, but even then the bread was gooey from over watered meat or soemthing.   Ew. Moving on.   Looks like Man will accompany me on my flight from Newport to Charlette. The guy managing this project decided to change his plans so he could go home a day early and Man, to his frustration, had to change around his flights and everything so accomodate. Don't you hate that, when people are like "oh, imma do this differently, so YOU get to change all your plans too." Blah.   No gym today! Eep! There just isn't time. Too much last minute preening to be done tonite. And last minute shopping. I must look georgeous!   Maybe I'll go for 30min to 1hr for cardio. If nothing else, the weights, well, they can wait. I don't want to be sore when he teaches me to kite board anyways.   Everyone needs to check out my  urlLink website !! There is a link to the pics from my brother's last theme party  Derelict  and links to other cool sites, such as back to this blog. ^_^ So I'll leave you now with that thought and say "Toodle-doo!!"  "tweedle-dee" said the bird.

      Wasting time until lunch, and I'm sure I will write again. Lunch. I think i'll have Subway, one of the wraps. But KimSon in the waterfall building is really tempting. No! Subway! After this weekend, next week, IU will eat wings, a burrito, and pack a better lunch! I dunno, I'll cheat next week, but I'm sure I'll go back and stick to this diet, cause I'm really starting to see the effects.    Garr: the Guy from the Gym.  Okay, I met this guy cause he randomly asked that I listen to a CD that he just recorded and tell him what I think. I listened to it, its rap/hip hop. Kinda normal like, think any song you might hear on the BOX sans Missy Elliot (the only one I listen to). Well, I was honest, I said that its really not my style but I'll pass it around and see what friends think. He's like, thats cool. I just want to get it out there, ya know? (btw, he talks kinda... ghetto?)  Later he came up while I was on cardio and asked if I was a student. No, I tell him i just graduated and now I'm doing cancer research. I asked if he was a student, nope, he just does his music recording. I said I went to A&M and did Genetics. he never mentioned a college, so I have a serious hunch that he never went. He's like "genetics? i have good genes" I'm like "oookayy?" He seemed kinda confused at the idea of cancer research and genetics. I dunno why....  Then yesterday he talks to me again. This time he's asking exactly what do I do with cancer research. Well, I try to explain as simply as I can what it is that I do. He looks at me like I'm speaking French. His reply is "Do you get to play with those things that go  bzzzzzzz ? "A centrifuge?" "Sure, yeah." The science that he knows is from CSI, that TV show. He thinks the you put stuff in there, it spins and tells you what is in it. I explained what it actually does. He's confused again. I think I messed up when I used the term "cell homogenate".   He says that he has a chemistry set in the garage he's been playing with. "what have you done so far?" I ask. 'Oh, just managed to blow things up." "hahaha..ha....ha..." "So do you get to take the mice into space?" Yup, he asked me that. "No, that would probably be my brother's department." "Oh? he's a rocket scientist" "Yeah, pretty much." Hmmmm....   I was really hoping that perhaps my obvious brain power would deter him from advancing any further. Cause you know, they always say that guys prefer not to date a woman  that  much smarter than them. And the less educated a man is, usually their machismo tells them that they should be the head of a relationship, and the leader and whatnot. Not in this case. Before he left he says that he would like it if me and some of my girlfriends or something would like to hand with him and his buds. I'm like "when?" "I dunno, you have the 9-5, not me." Yeah, don't display that too much. "Well, I'd have to get back to you on that then." Needless to say, I think I'll be really busy for a while.   I also think that maybe I should wear baggy, frumpy clothes to the gym now. Cause apparently my pants and wife beaters aren't detractive enough.   On a different note: Newman jimmy-riggin' prevails again! Remember how I ranted about SONY's damn prices for fixing and replacing things?? Well, here is what I did. I took a hair rubber band, blue to match the player, wrapped it around the earphone jack, plugged it in, and twisted the band once, and looped it over the opposite corner of the player. Now it pulls the jack to the side and holds it at the right place so that I get sound in both ears. That that! Eventually I'll just get another one off Ebay, cause thats actually cheaper than getting it repaired/replaced.   Well, its lunch time. Hitting the road to pull out money for NC and the like. I"M GOING TO NORTH CAROLINA IN TWO DAYS!!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!  I talked to Man last nite. We had missed each other for a couple of days, phone tag style. He tells me about the place he's working at now, how it's built to survive a nuclear fall out, so really neat. He asks about how my travel preps are going, and I tell about how happy I am my assay is finally working for me. We talk about bad plane experiences with other passengers. (He actually VDO taped a man snoring really loudly behind him once. This guy was annoying everyone, so no one stopped him. Isnt' that funny?!?!?!) He's burning a CD for the car trip from the airport when he gets me and whenever we drive around.   I can tell he is more comfortable talking to me on the phone these days cause he cracks more jokes, uses more cliches and silly sayings. Its a good feeling, cause I can get more and more of his personality through our conversations, and I'm more and more excited about seeing him again.   Okay, now I'm really gonna go to lunch.

      First: SONY. I bought a new MD player from EBAY for about $100 dollars. Well, while I was using it at the gym, the wire caught some equipment and snapped the jack in the player. So now the controller doesn't work and the inside of the jack is loose so there is bad connection with my earphones. I call to ask about repairs and replacements. WELL, they want $102 JUST FOR THE CONTROLLER!!! Q#$(%^!#$!#@%! !! Then I asked about repairing the jack. Well, I was todl i coudl get a refurbished one for $131.81 or fix that one for $109.33!!! Shit. I bought it for less! So, it looks like I'm just going to have to save my money for a month or so and bid on a new one on EBAY. Sony can bite me.   Then there is North Harris Montgomery Community College. They won't send me my transcript cause my address in their system is different than the one that I wanted them to send it to. But I had it sent to my apartment in College Station with no troubles. So I get to send them a fax that has something of my name and address on it, like a bill of sorts, to prove I live at this address and get it changed and then ask for some. Grrr....   OKay, I had to vent. I actually really feel better. Other than that, life is peachy!  In three days I will be on my way to NORTH CAROLINA! Aren't you tired of hearing about that? I'm so excited. Relax, vacation and see Man again. How nice will that be?!?! I'm going to pick up a book on Thursday from the library for beachside reading while Man is out kite boarding.   I think that after I go to NC, i will back off the ridiculous amount of time that I spend at the gym. I will also eat something else than a sandwich for lunch. Hmmmm... but then I will gain my weight back. Oh the issues.   OH! I'm thawing catfish! that means mucho protein tonite and tomorrow nite! I've been making fruit smoothies lately. Thanks goes to Ginger and Neel for getting me that blender! I put in fat free yogurt and my protein powder too. Thats a total of 31g of protein in there! Thats also alot fo sugar, but its before my workout, so I figure that its okay.   Hmmm.. I want a snack. I should bring up a protein bar or some peanuts or something in the future for that craving I always get around 3:30. Water, lots of water sure helps too though. Plus, then I have to go to the bathroom more with takes time away from the current monotony. After NC, I'll start my assay with the other cell lines (cause its working this time) and I'll be busy again.

      I'm trying to get a picture on my blog here, and its not working. The empty box to the left is supposed to be that picture of my eye that I have as my MSN profile pic and my AIM buddy icon. I think it is now my Newman Symbol. But its not working!! If you click on it, it will take you to my website, and sometimes when you come back, the picture is there. But thats not a guarantee.   Flowers are friggin' expensive! Or maybe FTD is just friggin' expensive. I was thinking about having flowers sent to Madre on Momma's Day cause I will be in North Carolina, but its like, damn, costs alot. To me anyways.   I also need to get my new MD Player fixed. Its friggin' annoying that it snapped in the first place. Seeing as how the warranty does not cover "Acts of God" (yes, it really says that) I'm going to have to pay to get it fixed. In the meantime I suppose I'll just have to deal with the old one. What a pain.   Going to North Carolina this weekend! Eeep! Gonna go on and close out the Wells Fargo account, use that money for the spending cash on the trip. I know he said that he'll cover everything else, but yeah, I hate to just go and really expect that. And maybe I need to bring something back for Madre since I am missing Mom's Day and her Uncle and Aunt. They are coming in for a day, they used to live in Galveston, gonna check out their old place and visit Madre.   My cousin Kelly is about to have her baby!! Due on May 25th! Named him Luka. Its a Russian name, not too out there but yet unique. I like it! Maybe at the end of the summer I can take a trip out there and visit them all. Maybe I can convince Dad that he, Clark and I really need to go and he'll foot the bill. Hahaha!   OKay, back to the research!

      Looks like I left off last Thursday, before noon. Well, that evening I had dress rehersal for the show, I was about 15 minutes late, and missed the run through of our dance. Luckily, the girls didn't feel too good about the run through and wanted to do it again, so I asked Buchner if she would mind and we did. Yay! I didn't rush home and sit in traffic for nothing. Then we cleaned it for about an hour after that. Good times, we all still click really well, better I'm almost thinking. Probably cause we are older.   Friday night was the show!! It felt so great! We got so many compliments on it and people were even saying that of the reunion dances, ours was the best! Yup, even over the younger kids! Hahaha. Rumour has it that when the younger girls saw our dance they went back and beefed theirs up in an attempt to not get showed up. Well, they did anyways. Hehehe. After the dance itself was over, Ms. Buchner anounced each of our names and graduation years, she started crying on our group and announced to everyone that I'm in cancer research.  So everyone that came up to me was like, "so your the research girl?"  Now she likes me I guess. I probably gave her the most greif of any of the colonels. That I know of anyways. I was the first colonel to get a demerit. Being at the top, the only person that could give me one was Buchner herself, so she was pretty pissed at me once. Heh. It took five years, but I finally won her over, I guess.   After all the pleasantries after the show, my age group (c/o 99, 00, and 01) went with some of the parents and Buchner to Ninfas for margaritas. Me, being how I am, forgot my ID. Goober that I am. Well, when Ms Buchner got there (I think its about time I call her Betty?) she said that I should call her mom while we are there. I did while the waiters were around and then she turned to one and was like "This is my daughter, she forgot her ID. I can vouch that she is older than 21, could you please let her order something?" There were hesitatn, but since it was this big festive gathering of people, they conceded. People were like "Yup, she really likes you now."   In high school, especially my senior year, people used to ask if we were mother/daughter, or at least related some how. Its the hair and skin type. Build is kinda similar too, come to think of it.   Anyways, the Saturday performance felt good, but not as together and tight as the Friday performance. After that show, everyone just kind of disappeared, so Madre and I went to Chili's to eat something, I was hungry! I got to watch the dance on mom's VDO camera, and it looked pretty damn good, if I must say so myself. For choreographing and cleaning it in all of, oh, 10 hours total? Yeah, it rocked! Yet the evening left me feeling kind of odd.  I'm already feeling kind of meloncholic coming back to the city I grew up in to take the next step of my life. The only people I know here really is the crew that I know from high school, and they have developed other Houston lives as well. I dont' have the means to go to Austin, Dallas, or College Station every weekend where my other friends are all spread out too. Luckily my weeks are full of work and lifting, and my weekends so far have been pretty filled up. But then this happens. I loved it, it was so much fun, but its a shock to my haphazard life to go back to my high school, dance with my old drill team, and reconnect with these people. These people I spent so much time with and didn't keep in touch with. Its crazy. Leaving the dance team behind yet again kinda made me feel like I just emptied out another peice of me. *sigh*   Okay, happy thoughts now!   urlLink This is where I'm going to be in North Carolina!!  Isn't it awesome! Man tells me that this is the only place other than the West Coast that you can get a water sunset. He sent me a sunset pic from last time he was there. And he actually sent me a post card of Hatteras Lighthouse. He wanted to rent a house on the beach, but they only let them out for either 3 nights or a week, and he needed four nights. He's getting there a day earlier. Same usually with these condos, but he was able to negotiate. I kinda think he has be just waiting for an excuse to do all this. Heh. I was telling him, you know, all I expected was a hotel room, maybe with a view. But he's like "Nope. This is your first time to the Outer Banks, we're gonna do it right!"   I'm so excited!! Its going to be so much fun! I think that he is just as excited too. He wants me to bring a DVD of my dance with me, so I got that recorded today. He's bringing his training kite so that he can teach me to kite board! Yay! Oh, its about... 9:15  there now. I'm going to give him a call before I get too pooped and crash. He leaves tomorrow, I want to see if he is going to have the new board he made ready. He's so neat! No, wait... he's absolutely fascinating! Don't get me started.

      Such as, the potluck dinner I'm going to tonite at Mildreth's place. The many CDs that I burned to keep me happy at work. Buying  The Princess Bride  on DVD from Target. Finding sore muscles after a hard judo workout. Seeing that the Google directed ads on my blog lead you to Spanish lesson resources. My pics on webshots.com (under DancerNinja) have topic direct ads that lead to martial arts resources. My bottle of Diet Coke. By big bottle of water with the sports top. The Irish flag patch on my bag. The accents on all the cute-tastic little Mexican fellas running around here. Okay, baibai.

        Friday Night:   Went up to College Station, leaving Houston about, oh, 7? A few of my friends have assembled into a band, they are really good, and I hadn't heard them. I take off, and first I go to Bob's to buy a book on judo, then I head to Northgate. They start the show at around 10pm, though it was scheduled for 9:30. I should know this is how it works. But damn, they really are good. I'm in love with this one song, Crimson Melody. Just beautiful. Then we run around to various bars and I watch my friends throw back some car bombs. I didn't have anything cause I had the bright idea to head back to Houston at 1:30 in the morning. I got home at 3am. BED.     Saturday:   Alarm frightened me awake at 10am. I dragged myself out of bed and over to the dojo for judo practice. Real smart thinking, Newman. But, seriously, I'm glad I did that. I love judo. Okay, so I fight for two hours, go home, shower, get laundry, go to Madre's and bum. I take an hour nap and then madre and I go to Joe's Crab Shack for the 33 shrimp for 10.99 deal they have going on. Oh my word, it was so very very good. And I was absolutely stuffed.   Then I went and met Hedish, Hebert and Brian over at Danny's. We ponder for a while what to do (I  really  wanted to check out the gay pride parade. Gay men crack me up.) But instead we head over to The Volcano, a bar off Bissonet near the Rice Village. It was a pretty nice place. Drinks are so much more expensive here in Houston as compared to College Station, but they use the better alcohol here and it tastes so much better. I was the DD so I just had a mojito and white russian.   Drunk men, oh my word. These two guys came up and started talking to us. One guy is like "I'm a coon-ass!" and startes dancing and singing. His friend acts all embarassed. but then he starts to ask each one of us in turn, in German "Do you speak German?" We all know what he is saying, so are like "No, but he does!" ang grab Danny. This dude's eyes were like 'oh shit', cause Danny leans over and starts spouting out all this German and the guy just waves him off. We find out all he really knew how to say was "1, 2, 3" and I guess he was using it as a pick up line (?!?!?!) and we completely ruined his game.   Well, thats not all. Brian had been eyeing this cute girl all night, and then got the bright idea to make up a pick up line. You ready for this? "I'm from the future and I've been sent back in time to protect you. I need to buy you a drink." Yes, seriously. Hedish thought it was great, but keep in mind, her middle and last names are 'Sara Conner'. Well, she was all like, "No, we're leaving soon" and some guy comes up and is like "I'll have a drink with you." Brian is just like "well... shoot, okay." Oh well.    Note:  Guys, don't use some contrived line. "Hi, my name is _____." Is fine. "Can I buy you a drink" is okay, just don't use too forcefully.     Sunday:   I did not want to get up. I never get enough sleep on the weekends, and I'm too stubborn to take naps during the day most of the time. Its a miracle I did on Saturday for an hour. I had to seriously debate that one too.   I got in to the lab abour 10:15 and took care of my stuff. Sergio came in and did his thang too. Mildreth didn't come in and I had no way to get ahold of her. We were gonna do a dinner thing, but we had never set a time. When I left, around 12:30, she still hadn't come in so I left a note for her to call me and left. I picked up Chipotle on the way to Madre's place. We watched Boondock Saints (I still need to get that back to Darby) and Mildreth called around 2:30. She had been having car troubles all weekend, still having car troubles. So we decided to post-pone the dinner thing until a better, less stressfull time.   I half slept and half watched Boondock Saints and Zoolander on TV. Then I went to Target, bought a new CD player for work and The Princess Bride on DVD, and headed home with the intention of cleaning my apartment. I did clean the kitchen, and I put away my clothes, but it stopped there. Then I set the computer to make Wav files from some MP3s, and I went to Starbucks to get a Chai Latte and low fat coffee cake. I returned, started burning music CDs and put Princess Bride on the tube. yay! It was a nice, though not a cleaning night. It was still productive in my book.     Today:   I think I will start planning out some Western experiments. I've never done a Western straight through from start to end. This can be an adventure with all the interns too. Okay, here they are, time for me to work.

      Yeah, thats right, and you can read it for yourself. Hedish O'Connor (hehehe) has threatened to kick my ass if I don't update. Well, I better get in gear. I bruise easily.   SO nothing much has happened. With this weather, nothing much can happen. I went to judo last nite despite the impending stormy weather. I love judo, I'm really starting to get a feel for what they are trying to teach me, I think. Its beautiful. I need to get one of those bike inner tubes so that I can do my drills and uchikomis at home.   Tonite I have been considering going to CS to see Jason's band perform, then coming right back home. I'm somewhat hesitant ahora because of the weater. Its GRAY and DARK out there. Depressing. I like it when its gray outside, but dry and cold. The kind of weather to wrap up in your heavy pea coat and go walking in a park alone with your thoughts. But this, the humid warmth, the wetness, the rain, the BLECH. I should still be in bed.   Last nite, I fell asleep with my Scientific American. Passed out in the middle of an article, and I've never slept so well. The power of science. ^_^  So, does anyone know of a place that would have closed curcuit/constant live feed of the Olymipics? We of the Diamondback Dojo are looking for a place where you can maybe rent a room and kick back and watch continuous, uninterupted Olympic play. Of course, we will be wanting to watch the judo. We think that with satelites, its completely possible, we just have to find a place that offers it. And we know judo won't be shown in America cause Americans are dorks, but it will be all over Asia and Europe, so the signal is going to be floating around out there. Catch it! Catch it!   The boss is in today. Brought me new compound 8 for the negative control. Brought the new printer for the lab. Brought a new ink cartridge for Jun. Will write me the memo for Dr. Gimble to get me into graduate school. I don't care about the rain, I will be a grad student soon enough AND I want to eat Chipotle. I didn't bring a lunch. I'm gonna brave the weather and GET ME A BURRITO!! Mmmmm... their chicken is so good.   Well, McAfee found a virus in my Bear Share, now I can't download music. Kazaa only seems to have corrupted files anymore. I can't find a plug in for Winamp to output Wav files. And I have nothing to burn a music CD with anyways. Scratch that, I found a program, but I have no WAV to see if it work. Gibble.   Well,thats about all for now, the interns should be in shortly. Talk to you fools later.

      Yeah, I think that was the theme of the past, oh, four days. I had that question posed to me from four different people in four days. Two guys from judo practice on Thursday, on separate occasions were like "You're about, what? 125? 130?" Ha! Not since junior high. Then Darby and my brother both, on Saturday, seperately are like "Newman, how much do you weigh?" Not that I'm shy about it, if you ask, I'll tell ya. I just found it odd that it came up so much in such a short period of time. I'm not a light girl. And my weight hasn't changed in the past, oh, 4 months or so?  I HAVE A TV AND DVD PLAYER!!! The first thing I did when I hooked it up was watch Darby's Boondock Saints movie that I've been holding onto for, goodness, nearly a year now??? Yeah, I think she can finally have it back. It was a sigh of releif to watch it. Such a good movie. And you know what else is a good movie? ZOOLANDER!! I think you have to be a genious to make something that hilarious/dumb. Like, its smart dumb, subliminally dumb, ya know?? Not just anyone can make a dumb movie with finesse, without making you want to roll your eyes from time to time. All hail Zoolander.   I need to start a library. Princess Bride, Center Stage, Zoolander, Office Space, Breaveheart, Boondock Saints, Super Troopers, these are at the top of my list so far.   I'm working on the Spanish still. I think I expect too much of myself. I'm trying to learn all verb forms and usages and such RIGHT NOW!! Thats whats most frustrating for me. Cause I HEAR THEM USE THEM ALL!!! Well, several I hear often, so I will focus on those. But there are so many exception verbs, that I just have to memorize, and thats gonna take time that I have to have to take. Blech, I just need to stop being so shy about it. I'm such a pansy about using it.   This dude that claims to be 30 and living in Tennessee randomly IMed me on MSN a few months ago. When I lived at my mom's place, I made the mistake of chatting to him a few times. WEll, I haven't chatted with him since I've moved to Adobe del Amor of the Blair House, and everytime he's online he sends a message, about how he wants to chat. Once he was like "You're only 23, you don't have a job. Talk to me." I got this message when I GOT HOME FROM WORK. I thought, "F you" and closed it. For the past month he'll send a message, then a few minutes later, he'll send that red mad face icon. What a freak.   I know, all I have to do is take him off my list and block him. Why do I have issues with taking names off buddy lists?? I have names on AIM that are long defunct and, well, I can't get rid of them. Cause, its like junk, they might use it one day!! As for this guy, I should, I dunno why I don't. Gives me a reason to feel another emotion, this one is freaked.   OKAY HEDISH! ARE YOU HAPPY?? I UPDATED!!! ^_^ This is all for her.   I just need something crazy to happen to me. Then I will write much more. Something like, I dunno, something.   Later, kids.

      I forgot to take my vitamins today. I also didn't make coffee. This makes for one really really tired Newman. I didn't bring coffee yesterday and I was fine. But no vitamins and I'm dragging ass in a major way. I'm tempted to run over to Starbucks and get me some coffee, or over to CVS and grab a coke or see if they have those double shots. If I go to Starbucks, I can nab some sweetner packets while I'm at it.   Went to judo last nite. I love judo. No, I don't think you understand. I   LOVE   judo! So John there is working with me on my technical game. I'm to stop being so defensive and stop playing such a power game. But that's all I've ever played. So I feel like I'm being reprogrammed, and having been out of it for 6 months isn't helping. Things are gonna get messy. He warns me that in practice I'm going to get thrown a lot more and I'm going to get frustrated for a while, but then things will click after a few months. A FEW MONTHS!?!?!? I hope things start clicking before Go Shibata. I want to compete there and really kick some ass.   Well, I haven't spoken to Man since Monday, when he called and I bitched at him online. For all he knows, after he said that stuff about his new number, I just closed the window and went on my merry way. I'm still contemplating. I don't forgive easily like I used to. I've had guys be bitches like such before.   Today is going to be a slower day at work. Next week I hope I can find more things for the interns to do. I'll be starting them off on their own stuff.   Okay, today they will be watching the others do things such as PCR and mitochondrial membrane potential things. So its all good. Only, well, Sergio showed up and Mildreth isn't here. But they don't really have phones at the apartments they are set up in so I can't get ahold of her and see if she is okay. I hope she just over slept or something benign as such.   Okay, I'm going to look important for a bit. Later, kids.

      Looks like I have something to talk about....  Guess who happens to be alive and well? Man Nguyen. Yup. He called me today while I was teaching the interns cell culture technique. I didn't answer the phone, I'm a "if its important, they will leave a message" kind of person. So after I dismiss the interns, I g to check my phone and the area code is 425.... hmmmm... isn't that Seattle?? So I check the message, sure enough, it's Man.   The message basically went "I know its been a long time since we've talked. I've been thinking about you. I'm at the office now (office number here). Call me back."  So I go pee.   Then I get back and message him on MSN with "What the hell??" So I bitch about everything, and he appologizes. He says that he is "so sorry" and "I should have kept in contact more" and "I completely understand" how I'm upset. So he gives me his new cell phone number and I say "Honestly, I'm at a loss" He says "I understand" and "I have a new number cause my ATT contract ran out, so I thought I would give it to you. You can call me if you want or you can close this window and not save my and not have contact with me ever again."  So I've been talking to Ken and Conner about being strong and holding out for better. Shit, I'm weak too. I want to call him and be like "When will I see you again?" and "What the hell is wrong with you?!?!" all at the same time. Ping says I should just forget him. Ken says if I call him she would understand. Cause, really, where do I meet people? Work? (no!) Gym? (Garr?) Judo? (over 40)   I can go sit at coffee shops, but really, what guys randomly go up and talk to a girl at coffee shops? I can hope against hope that I meet someone in grad classes. I've never met anyone in a class before. I'm not too keep on hooking up online. I've been in Houston since December and the one person I've clicked with lives in Seattle and went and did this.   Thats one reason I'm hesitant to let go. Another reason is I hate to think that I flew out to North Carolina, had this great wonderful weekend and its just like *poof* The End. Does it have to be 'sayonara' rather than 'ato de' or 'mata ne'?? And he really is an interesting person, I always realy enjoyed talking to him cause of all the neat things he had going on in his mind. SO what? Can I call and keep touch and just be buds I suppose? After all, he lives in friggin' Seattle, what can come of that??   I took down the pics of us when it became evident that he wanted nothing to do with me. EVIDENT!! It was perfectly clear that he was content to be out of my life! And he says that "I really have been thinking about you" "and thats the truth" So why didn't you call or email or message me.   So I've come to the conclusion that I'll wait until after judo to decide wether to call him or not. I need the time to re-evaluate my feelings and my plan of attack, if there is to be one. Plus, judo helps clear my head. I dunno, its like, the fighting wears me out so much that I just dont have the engergy for excess thoughts and emotions or something. Maybe all the being thrown around helps me get life in perspective. And maybe I can get the story on Guy. Plus laughing with the other judokas, even if way older than me, gets me in a good mood. The being beaten to a pulp also tends to boost my confidence to a point where I know whats best for me and what I should and shouldn't put up with. I love fighting. ^_^    NEWMAN SHAKES HER FIST AT ALL MEN!!!    On a side note, I went swimming in the pool last nite. It was actually quite nice. It was about 9pm, nice and dark, with this spotty cloud cover overhead. I just swam back and forth, froggy style, and on my back. I took the laptop out for music and it was relaxing. I had a slight headache that holding my breath on and off didn't help, so I only stayed for about 30 mins.   Sergio invited me to go to the Astros game tonite with the other kids from Technologio, but I declined, being that I'm not much of a baseball fan. I think I should have agreed to go, I bet they are crazy, would have been mucho fun anyways I bet. Oh well, hopefully they'll invite me out again.   I need more friends in Houston. Joe at work was surprised to find that I really don't know many people outside of work here. He says he feels sorry for me. Hmmm... I'm elisiting the sympathy of others... that can't be good.   Ahhh... tori amos, amee mann, and ani difranco. They know how to make me feel better. Ooooh, and a glass of the new chai mix I bought!  I'll go to the gym today. Prolly not until around 7, 7:30. I don't like going that late, but its a small price to pay for avoiding the massive crowd that seems to go between 5 and 7. I'm not anti-social, i'm just there for a purpose and I don't want to waste my time waiting around for others.   Haven't seen Garr at the gym for over a month. Hedish thinks he  must  be on tour with his new album. I think he couldn't make the next payment on his membership.   Okay, gym time is around the corner, so I'm going to do some Spanish and get my ass in gear.

      Well, I ran into a Japanese person that works here. Sadly, the only thing I could think to say at the time was "Nihonjin?" "Sugoi" Dammit. Oh well, I've seen him around, I'm sure I'll see him again. Pocket person.   -----  I just finished some work. I walked through a Day 2 of the assay for one of my interns (read: slaves ^_^ ) at 3:30. Then I did my stuff. Wheee! Now its almost 6 o'clock, I want to get home and make some dinner and I need to go to the HEB. Blech. I hate grocery shopping..... I wish there was a Super Walmart that was closer than Westheimer outside the loop. Okay~ later.

      So I've actually be busy lately. Yippee. Here is the run down of what I did last weekend, cause I know you are all gripping your seats, waiting to hear:  I went to Diamondback Judo to get my ass kicked on Saturday. I started laundry before I left, and finished it as I showered off the grime of those mats. I wonder how often they clean them? Then I headed up to College Station where I hung out with Ashley. We went to Sweet Eugenes, as usual, then ate at Wing Stop, rented and watched "Y Tu Mama Tambien", then I went out and hung out wiht my old judo team boys.   Sunday Ash and I went to Ross where I bought 4 shirts for $25! Then we went to Roly Poly to bug Barbra. We colored signs for them to put up on the walls, Ash's:Ashley Prefers the Poly. Mine:Eat more DNA! Buy a Roly Poly! Then we took a 45 min walk around the neighborhood before I headed up to the REC for judo practice. At judo I got my shin smashed repeatedly again and it hurt like crazy to walk and swelled up a bit. Bah!  After judo I went to Dr. Safe's lab and picked up some MDA231 cells from Kathy, headed back to Houston, hung with the madre a bit, then back to the lab to plate them out. I was at the lab from about 12am to 2:30am. Home, shower, bed.   Monday the interns from Monterrey Tech came in. We have two in the lab here, Sergio and Mildreth. Ping and I took them to the waterfall building for lunch, then I showed them basic cell culture technique. I gave each of them their own cell line they will assay.   Tuesday, in the AM I had them start their own stock of cell culture media and make trypsin. After lunch we finished the media, then I showed them the basics of the WST assay that I'm doing, both the WST part and the dosing part.   Tuesday evening I went to judo practice. Got my ass kicked. After two weeks, you would think that my head would be starting to get back into the right place, but I feel like I'm regressing. I feel like they are reprogramming me, and even though I say that things usually get messier before they get clean, I don't like it when it happens to my mentality. Stick with it, it will all fall back into place.   Today in the AM I had them aliquot out some compound for them to use with the assays and had them think through the dilutions. In the afternoon they followed Jun as he did a transfection. Then we all decided that Friday we will go to an Indian buffet, it just opened and has a special going on, 2 lunches for $10.   This has all kept me busy, I usually come in at 8:30 and I have them come in around 9:30, so I have an hour before they come to get things together and get my stuff out of the way. Then they usually leave around 4, so I have until about 5 or 5:30 to finish my things. Its fine, I like this, I like the teaching. And I make them laugh, so its all good.   Lately I've been bringing egg sandwiches to lunch. Makes me happy. Its a practicalls all protein lunch! The bread is fiber and protein, then the cheese and the ham and the egg. Its all good! Stuffs me!  So I need to go to the gym today. I always want to try to go early, but when I do, its friggin' crowded there! So I end up wasting time waiting for machines or benches or whatever and I don't get out until the same time! Argh! Ja, ne... What to eat for dinner?

      I have a new dream home. This one is not a loft/condo, but a house in Rochelle, New York.  urlLink Go here to take a gander at it!  This is exactly what I'm looking for. This cream colored looking walls, with the Spanish tile roof. And look at the area. This is just under a million to buy, so once again, when y'all are all ready to go in on this.   No! I don't like Sex and the City! No! I don't like "reality TV" shows! Ever since the first airing of "Real World"! But I  do  like Star Trek. I've even been to a convnetion. And I'm not fat or pimply, I'm just a good ol' dork.   This week we are supposed to have some students from ITESM (Monterrey Tech) come here for a summer research program. I wonder how many? I wonder if any will be in this lab? I wonder if any of the guys are cute? ^_~  I think they come tomorrow? Maybe not until Monday. Who's to say?  JUDO TONITE! THEN if i'm not too tired I"LL GO TO 24 HOUR EYE CANDY! Lets see if I can catch another glimpse of Hotness. Dammit, I should at least try to smile at him. I'm such a... yeah... scared.   Okay, later.

      Still trying to learn the Spanish.   I tried out the Japanese program. Way way way too simple. I need to find one that like the Spanish one that I have. I need the review, but there isn't much to learn from it. *sigh*.   So I was reminded by a dear friend that I didn't mention enough of the time that I spent with Jess. I went to his place on my way home from Conroe, picked him up and we went to sit at a Starbucks for 2-2.5 hours I guess. People watching and talking. We've decided that the recent engagement of Darbiness makes us feel old. High school, people! What happened to our youth? We know that when we actually go to the wedding, its going to kind of be a reality check for us. Who's next? Theories, but no conclusions.   For all you ladies that would like to know the update on him, he's doing well, taking the first half of the Bar exam at the end of the summer (yeah, I didn't know either that there were two parts). He's taking it in Oklahoma, so that means he'll either have to retake it in Texas to practice here, or just settle in OK. I told him he has to get out of there. The red dirt made my family there crazy, I don't want to see the same thing happen to him. But he's doing really well, adjusting to the country style bars and line dancing clubs. Poor guy.   Okay, so everyone knows of my current trend. I guess, kinda trend... I dated a guy named Hee, then I had this long distance fling thing with a guy named Man. Well, lo and behold, there is a young, attractive guy at my judo club named, well, Guy. I think that it only goes that if he is single, I have to give it a try. You know, keep it alive.   He's probably spoken for and I'll have to look for another Guy.. Or a Him, Boy, Fella... you get the idea.   So after going to judo and meeting Guy, I went to 24 Hour Eye Candy and saw Hotness for a brief few minutes. I bet you thought he was out of the picture. Nope, I think I'll be going to the gym after judo more often now. At least when practice is a little lighter anyways. I did a workout yesterday that made my lats sore. Yay! Another thing to add to my circuit.   Who out there DOES NOT like Sex and the City??? I can't stand that show! That and reality TV shows, they make we want to kick someone! First with Sex, they portray life as a series of sexual encounters and nice shoes. ARGH!!! Maybe if they had DID SOMETHING ELSE THAN BE WHORES they would have something else to talk about, stop being so superficial and perhaps make them feel like their lives are worth living. Of course, they probably have intellectual capacities of sparrows, so their one track mind (sex? sex!) is all they can handle, which even that is too much at times.   Don't get me started on reality TV. Just turn off the TV, put down the remote, and go live your own life. So you want reality? Go outside! Get a job! Eat a sandwich! The people that they dig up to go on these shows aren't worth watching, certainly not worth discussing at any point. Goodness.   So there is my rant. Thats worn me out and I should get something to eat. Damn, no change. I need to get back to work. Ciao.

      I finally finished installing the Spanish computer program and began using it. So very addicting! It has this feature where you record yourself and there is a guage to tell you how you sound on a scale from tourist to native. Sometimes I wonder how accurate that is, though, cause I know I've stumbled and it did't pick it up. Then again, I have it on a leniant setting.   But I've probably already put in a few hours working on that program. I'll be hablando en epanol in no time. ^_~  Friday night, dancing at Drink Houston with Hedish, Kentesheia, Kelcey, Danny and Thorsten. Saturday, laundry, fix car, have Hedish and Ken over. Saturday night, dancing agian at Drink Houston with Hedish, Ken, Simha, Neel, and Ginger. Sunday, clean apartment and start the Spanish program. Sunday evening/night, play in the lake at Danny's house. Sunday, eat too much, visit Jessi, visit Mom, and study more Spanish. This morning, get dressed, study Spanish, and go to work.   Thats the run down of my weekend. I'm Hungry and have no food at home. Well, nothing yummy.   .....  Well, I'm not hungry anymore. I just ate at Chipotle. That place is so good BUT SO MANY CALORIES AND SO MUCH FAT!! Oh well. I'm going to judo practice today, and I think that I will take a change of clothes so that I can hit up the 24 Hour Eye Candy on Jones before heading back home. Might as well, I can and they have better things to look at and I'll be in the general area. ^_^ Judo will be the cardio, I'll just do the arms and maybe abs.   This weekend, methinks I want to go to College Station and chill with Ashley and then fight with my old team on Sunday evening. That would be fun.   So sleepy from so much food. I hope I don't get late to judo cause of my new-found addiction.   Okay, later, gators.

      Thats why I didn't go last nite. To the pudding wrestling club. Cause I don't want puddin' on my hips, be it the inside or outside of them. I hope they had fun.  urlLink Hedish  better write about it in he blog!  Topic of these days when I talk to those of The Estate and The Hollister Crew: ask him out! You ain't got nothing to lose! Well, maybe I do... maybe I  like  to obsesse from afar! Okay, so no one likes to do that really. He likes Guiness and judo. Thats about all I have to go on. Oh, and he can salsa, he says. Bat my eyes and ask him to teach me. Wouldn't we look cute, salsa dancing at the dojo in our judo robes. DUHT!  Would you look at that! 'Tis raining outside and I can still see blue in the sky! Thats a recipe for a rainbow if I ever saw one. Where to look?   OH! Jewel's "Standing Still" song is on the radio. The dancer in me LOVES THAT SONG. It makes me want to frolick. I have it on my computer, I'll frolick at home before judo.   -------------------------  Okay, I had to play with cancer for a bit. OH MY WORD! Its so pretty outside now. The perfect cloud cover with sunlight. Oh man, I want to go outside to eat, but I need to not be spending money. Hey, I get paid at midnight tonite! why worry, right?? ha!  Subway has this mediterranian wrap in the Atkins friendly diet menu. Now, I'm no Atkins fan, but geeze, it was so good. Maybe I'll get that instead of Chipotle tomorrow for lunch...... mmmm, burrito. Thats a tough one......  I have to come it work on Saturday for at least 2 hours. I wonder when I'll be doing that? Will I have to come in Sunday? Lets see... yep! Written in the calendar! Written in stone. So will I go to College Station this Sundy for judo? I'll let you know tomorrow, or after judo tonite. Hmmm.....  I really could use a back adjustment/alignment methinks. My neck is just irritating me up and down these past few weeks. Maybe its cause of the way I'm sleeping with the bad shoulder, compounded upon the stree judo puts on it, and that I think I store my stress there. It feels so good when it finally will pop, but that will only happen once, maybe twice, a day.   I have decided perhaps I should try to lose weight for the next tournament. Since I can't weight lift due to the shoulder injury, it will be much easier to drop class. I dunno, we'll see.   I better be able to keep up the training when my classes start. My time management will have to get better, thats for sure.   onaka ga heta. hirugoha wo tabeni ju-ikkai ni iku.

      This time I'm waiting for my western to tranfer to a membrane for me to probe tomorrow. I'm also waiting for my proliferation assay to complete its 30 minute incubation step. Then after all that, I'll be waiting for 5 o'clock. ^_^  Yesterday I went to a baseball game with a group of friends. I'm not much of a baseball fan, but the overall experience was nice. I skipped out of work at around 5, 5:15 and Metro'ed it downtown where I met up with some people at the Flying Saucer. It was $2.50 pint night, but since I"m not a beer type, and I filled up on a coffee and muffin from Starbucks, I watched that action. We wandered on down to the stadium, which is rather nice I must say, and had $1 hot dogs. I haven't have a hot dog in probably well over a year. Its wasn't so bad. Probably will only have them when I'm at $1 hot dog nite. After the game, Hedish drove me home and I passed out.   I realized something today. I got all over the town with out ever having to drive a car. Now, I did ride one from the stadium to my home, but I took the bus or the train everywhere else. That leaves warm fuzzies in me.   I pretended like I was back in Japan.   I pretended like I lived somewhere else.   I have to get out of here sooner or later. Ugh.   OBSESSION SECTION!!!    JUDO? JUDO!   I've been reading the bios of the women's judo team for America for the Olympics.  urlLink Take a look for yourself.  There are a couple of things here that really give me hope that I can make something of myself.   Take  urlLink Celita Schultz  for instance. She is 36 and competing in her 3rd Olympic games this summer. At 36! Now, thats not really old or anything, but for an Olympian, it kinda is. So that makes me think, three olympics from now, I will be 35, and I'll have been doing judo for 16 years. Thats almost as long as I've been doing dancing. Assuming no major injuries that knock me out of the sport..... possibility?  Then there is  urlLink Ronda Rousey . She is 17 and going to the Olympics, which is really just amazing. But get this, she became ranked #1 in her weight class after doing judo for only 6 years. 6 years!! I've been going for 4 now, and part of me always thinks that these people started the sport when they were in early elementary, and thats why they were here. But look at that! I haven't trained as hard as she must have, nor do I have the contacts that she has for training, but still, it gives me hope if nothing else.   Another cool thing. Three of the girls on the team are from California and the other two were born in Texas. TEXAS, BABY!! We build them tough!   Well, I need to head out to get to my own judo practice. I got goals, baby! GOALS!!

      I feel so rested after the weekend. I was able to get out of bed easily at 7:30 for the first time in about, oh, three weeks, even though I dind't go to bed until about 1:30am. This weekend left me relaxed and rested, strangle so because it was quite full.   On Friday, I skipped out of work early to go to my Dad's and hang out. My aunt from Massachusettes was in town, and I haven't seen her in quite some time. We all go out to eat at El Palenque in Spring, it is delightful. I have the spinach enchiladas, and well, they were good, but I wish I had chicken. And I wish I had Mildreth's enchiladas. ^_^  My grandpa still amazes me. When all of his kids have mostly forgotten their Spanish, as he battles Alzheimers, and he is over 80 years old, he still can speak and joke around with the waiters in Spanish. He still remembers German too, I think, but I don't hear him use it cause who would he talk to? This man is brilliant. He has his PhD in chemical engineering. And he still stands up when a lady comes in the room, opens doors and pulls out the chair for my grandma and pretty much escorts her where ever she goes. Talk about happy ever after. They are why I still beleive and hold onto the dream that its possible to find some one person for the rest of your life.   I went home after the rain subsided and stayed up until 2am working on my skirt. I had to go to bed before I was done cause my sewing maching kept pissing me off. I'm not a pleasant person when I'm mad and sleepy.   Next day I went to judo. My shoulder is still a mess so I pretty much go, do the warm up, and sit on the sidelines and take mental notes. Oh well. This is driving me batty. I invite Guy to College Station, but it was just too short of a notice. Well, if he would just come to practice, maybe we could work it out better. But nooooo.   After that I get home, start laundry and eat something. Ash and Hedish show up and I'm still in my judo pants. Oops. I take a quick shower, conclude that my skirt still needs some alterations, and we head out to Brazil. I forgot that there was all that construction on 610, so I completely miss my exit, and have to take another way around. Still, Ash and I are there before the other people. Hedish and Hebert show up not to long after.   There was some definate eye candy there. The barista boy was pretty, I mean really pretty. Pretty and ethnic, thats how I like 'em. ^_^   Its so good to hang out with the old members of The Estate. We sat and talked there for about 2.5 hours! We kinda just went in a circle and had everyone tell their story to date. It was good times. Ash and I both had two iced coffees, so by the time we left, we were ready to just run to the next place. The girls talked me out of dyeing the underside of my hair black. So instead, I'll go for a deep chestnut color, still only the underside 1/3-1/4 of it. Just something that when my hair is in a pony tail or bun or braid that you can see.   Then we headed over to NikoNiko's, only the most amazing food there is in Houston. I got my usual, the lamb gyro with a salad. The salad alone is to die for. I just want a plate of tomatoe slices, with their herbs, dressing and feta chese over it. Screw the lettuce, olives, and bell peppers. Maybe they have an appitizer like that, or could just whip it up for me if I asked?? Hmmmm....  We all stuffed ourselves silly, then headed back to Adobe del Amor. We chilled there and chatted prolly for about an hour as we digested and attempted to wake up. Then we headed to the GingerMan in the Rice Village. Each got a drink and sat on the back porch and talked more. There is no way for us to out talk ourselves, I think. There is always something to discuss, hash out, or some reason to give each other shit. Ha!   Hedish and Hebert headed back to the Spring area at a little after 10pm. Ash and I went to Blockbuster to rent Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, cause we are goobers like that. We take it back to my apartment and MY DVD PLAYER BREAKS!! I put it in and it won't play. So I decide to take it out and wash it, but it won't open. If I turn it off it won't turn back on unless I unplug and plug it back in. In the morning I had to take a screw driver and take off the casing and the top to the actual reader part. Oh well, its was only a $9 player anyways.   In the morning we had our coffee and meal bars and headed over to my madre's place to watch the movie. Okay, get this. Ashley gets what I call "Giddy Fingers" during kinda goofy romance scenes. So, being that this movie is one big goofy romance sceene, she is going spaztic. She tries to sit on her hands to hold them down, but when the goofy romance gets intense, she tries to pull her hands out too fast and actually hurts herself. SHE INJURES HERSELF DURING A MOVIE!!! Ha! This is why we love you!  Madre comes home and takes us to Chilis for lunch/dinner. Oh! I got this margarita grilled chicken over rice and black beans, absolutely amazing. Well, after we get home, Ash heads out to get back to College Station. I stick around the momma's place for a bit longer and leave around 4 for judo practice at 6 in CS myself.   JUDO? JUDO!!!   It was a rather small practice. Just Theo and me teaching techniques to a yellow and a couple of white belts. So I didn't have to worry too much about the shoulder. I probably did more than I should have with the uchikomis. After practice I went to Bob's and paid for my old belt and ordered a new longer one. The one I have now, I can tie it around but I have to tie it kinda tight and there is only about, oh, six inches of belt left on eaither end of the knot. Not good.   Bob and Jackie told me about the tournaments that they are trying to get their kids to go to. They tried to convince me that I should go to the National Ladder tournament in Colorado Springs, but I would have to take way too much vacation time to do that. I'm going to hit up all the area things, and try to get a waiver to go to the national collegiates in the spring. Oh, I wanna go so bad so very very bad. Plus, Bob said that since I'll be fighting for A&M, they could scrounge up some money to help me pay for the trip. How aweseome is that?!?! I knew all the stress of leading that team would pay off some day. ^_^  I got to Houston around 11pm, picked up the laundry from my mom's place, and went back to my apartment. I wasn't quite tired yet, so I put the finishing touches on my skirt before I showered and went to bed.   Well, damn, hows that for an entry. I'm hungry now.

      ... Through my friggin' window. At least I have a window I suppose. Anyways, who would want to be out there. I WASH MY FACE in the morning, and I want to wash it again by the time I get to work. Damn this humidity.   With the interns gone, these entries are becoming more regular.   So guess who I see at the gym last nite? GARR!! Ha! He's back. I didn't get to talk to him, I was in the middle of an excersize when he walked by and waved. Wonder where he's been at this time. Where has be been all my life!?!?! HA!!  So I weighed myself at the gym last night, and I seem to have lost 3lb since last month. I don't know if this is a good thing or not. I'm thinking no. With judo practice and the joint injuries, I haven't been able to weight train as much as I like to, and I think that is the cause of my current weight loss. I never thought I'd say this, but I want those three pounds back!   Once this shoulder thing gets better (and it feels a little better every day) there will be no stopping me. Not like I'm going to tear myself up training, I'm going to be smarter about it. Try to at least. I've decided to start taking Glucosamine for my joints and L-Glutamine for protein metabolism and muscle recovery. I think my joints pop alot and get injured so much is because they are just looser than is normal. You've seen my elbows. My knees can bend backwards a bit too. So maybe taking these will help with those problems.   Adobe del Amor rocks. I need to invest in some pillows for hiding those wires...  There just really aren't any boys to talk about. And I feel like I'm supposed to put some plug in here about my relationships or my views on them and the like. Okay, here it is. Though I say that I've got my eyes open and maybe in person I'll talk about finding one, but usually I'll sit back and be like "okay, and where the  hell  am I supposed to fit a relationship into this life of mine??" During the week, I have my research, my lifting, my judo. I'm spent. On the weekends, well, they seem to fill up before I get to them, so really... I don't think I can even take care of a plant right now.   And really, judo is all I need. ^_^  I have judo today, lalalala.   I'm not going to have any data for Dr Safe tomorrow. Except all the graphs and stuff from the interns last week and yeah. I need to get that extra data from Mildreth. *sigh* I also need to go to the bathroom. Laters.

      Okay, now. Why don't I get anonymous people posting comments on my blog?? I want to be loved too. I recently read on  urlLink Headish Sara O'Conner's  blog someone who posted a comment randomly. I want a fan!   Work has been a drag. As soon as the kids are gone, I have to get back all my stuff into order, sort through their data, and take care of a bunch of administrative duties that I had let fall by the wayside. Wouldn't be so bad, but since I hurt my shoulder, I can't really lift and my judo training has taken a hug step back. So where is my stress outlet? Here, thats right, you will be getting it IN THE FACE!!  Cause thats where your eyes are after all.   My laptop randomly crapped out on me. Compaq. Then after two days of refusing to start up in anything but safe mode, I hit the reset button out of fury and then *poof* its fine. I dunno if it has to do with the system check that happens when you hit that button or if the computer felt the impending doom I was to unleash on it.   Judo? Judo! Can you say OBSESSED?!?!  I am the Window Shopper. (You all remember that?) I am prone to ferocious crushes. Since there isn't really a guy in sight, except for  that  Guy, my energies are redirected.   This Sunday I'll be going to College Station in the evening for a judo practice. Yeah, so my shoulder is hurt. I can still learn, and its as much of a social trip as it is a trainging opportunity. I'll invite that Guy, but he's not the deciding factor here.   One of my coaches fussed at me for doing weight lifting after hurting the shoulder. He's telling me that I seriously need to rethink and redirect my mentality depending on wether I want to be a bad-ass competitor or a bad-ass club fighter. The club fighting I could get easy. Its the competition that is the ever-looming foe. And he's telling me that I can't be going 110% all the time. That is how to get good in the dojo, but will fail me on the competition area. I have to do some things that Brian refers to as "chicken-shit" sort of excersizes and drills. One of those things is to sit back and heal. None of the "suck it up and ignore the pain" crap.   I know he's right, but damn, I hate being on the sidelines.   It has not even been one week since I hurt my shoulder. Already its driving me nuts!! I don't think I can make any tournament in August, we'll see how I feel by early September. Go Shibata is a must, I feel. Eep! My nemesis will be there too!!   Okay, I need to hit this printer a few times. Get some kinetic rehabilitation into it. Laters.

      The week will feel slow. The interns are gone, and all is quite again. Now only the sound of Chinese Chatter fills the air, interspersed with long bouts of silence. What is a girl to do? Well, write in her blog, of course.   John, one of my coaches, says that in four years, at 27, I should aim to go to Olympic Trial. I laughed. He says I have the talent, I just need to focus it. His persistance with the issue of my "being a champ" has taken me to the internet, where I looked up the bios of the current famale judo players on the olympic team. They all started early on in their life. No later than junior high anyways. Many are my age and younger. One girl is even 17!! So you know what? Yeah, right.   But all in all, there is no harm in training as though that is my goal, you know?  I popped my shoulder out in practice last Thursday. Oh, the pain. Luckily, it was about 20 mins from the end of practice, so I still had quite a work-out under belt. but trying to get out of my sports bra that night was excrutiating! I spent the weekend in Austin, so that gave me time to take it easy, missing the Saturday practice.   Today I'll go to practice and just let my body tell me what I can and can't do. I have to continute going for several reasons: 1)I paid $95 bucks for the month 2)If I take time away from the dojo, I'll lose much of the mind set that I've worked so hard to attain 3)I can still work on drills for timing and do conditioning work.   Coming up mid next month, there is a Senior Summer Training camp thing for a weekend in Hurst, Texas. I'm going to try to get some people to go there with me. This Sunday I'm going to College Station for a practice. I'll take it easy. And I've been thinking, I have an uncle that lives in Colorado Springs.... In a few months, it would be completely conceivable to take a week off (maybe during the Christmas Holidays, or even later around Easter), stay with him and do some training at the Olympic Training Center. I wonder how much the charge for practices there.... How awesome would that experience be?!?! I'm going to have to look into that.   Other thing in my life. I went to Austin to see the little brother. He's doing well. We went to a party that his friends were hosting. It was outside, so I had a mini-waterfall cascading down my back. Ew. There was this Asian looking guy there, wearing a "Made in Ireland" shirt. Wait just one second. So Clark and I go over there to call him out on it. He's like "Actually, my dad is Caucasian, so I do have some Irish in me somewhere... and to be honest..." he lifts his pant leg and on his ankle is a tattoo of a clover. "Everyone has their thing, I guess," he says.   Whoa... did I just meet my soul mate? Micheal was his name. I wonder if I'll ever see him again.  Sunday was mostly spent bumming around Clark's apartment while he and the mother cleaned the place. Madre and I came home, where she even vacuumed my apartment as well. Awwww. My apartment rocks. ^_^  I did go to the gym on Sunday night. Did cardio, bicep curls, and tricep presses. Thats about all I could think to do that didn't require me to my elbow away from my side. Anything else would make my shoulder get pissed at me.   Don't worry, I can feel it getting better. Slowly, ever so slowly, but getting better.   Okay, I should get back to my duties at hand. Laters, gators.

      Sadly, Ofoto requires you to sign in and stuff it seems, and you just can't search for pics like you can on Webshots. BUT you can put up as many pics as you would like. So here are some links to pictures:   urlLink Fourth of July    urlLink The Interns    urlLink Husky Village   I don't think I stand out at all, right?   Enjoy!

      Today was the last day for the interns to come into the lab. This is sadder than I thought it would be. I never expect them to have so much great personality. Even some of the guys from the other labs, ones that would come in and wait for Checo, came to say goodbye. I'll have pics of them up soon enough.  &nbsp; I'm really dredding what it will be like next week. The lab will be silent again. I just had six weeks of work, lots of it, but also lots of laughing and joking and just  conversation  which is pretty sparse among the other patrons of the lab. No, I haven't really cried or anything, cause I can keep in touch with them on MSN Messenger, but I bet I could if I thought about it too much.  &nbsp; So I won't.  &nbsp; I have some cells waiting for me.  &nbsp; There are always cells waiting for me.

      I know I've been lax in my updates, but I've been swamped. So here goes the update...     Friday Night    Went over to Husky Village, where the interns are staying, to party with them. I didn't realize that liquor stores close at 9pm, so when I left my apartment at 9pm, THEY WERE ALL CLOSED!! Where am I supposed to buy vodka!?!? Nowhere! So I settled on a bottle of shiraz from HEB and was on my way. I had my Kaluah.   Those kids are crazy! WE start off with a drinking game, the bounce the coin into the cup one. But instead they say "Double/Triple to so-and-so" and if them make it, that person now has to either make it or take the shots. If they miss first, they take the shots themselves. Then someone busts out some 50mL test tubes that they yoinked from the lab. At first they were like "20MLS!!!" and they would fill to the 20 with tequila, then the rest with Sprite, hit it on the counter and shoot it. Then they would yell "25MLS!!!", and you can guess the rest. Yes, someone at the end actually did a "%)MLS!!!" shot. Was super funny.   Then one kid, Inaki (pronounced, inyaki) did a series of really great card tricks for me. Then Roberto did one, and at the end, he just starts yelling, with his hands up and walks off, yelling, with his hands up. A series of weirder things are done, such as, they start making human pyramids in the living room, and we have a handstand pushup contest, then "Cotton-Eyed Joe" comes on and we all start doing the dance. Then some old song comes on and people start acting like they are at a junior high dance. I mean, just silliness all night. At one point Sergio comes in and yells to everyone that they should speak in English for me, not that I care either way, then he turns to his friend and just starts rattling off in Spanish. Yeah, way to go, Checo.   Well, someone calls in a noise complaint, the police show up and all the girls get to hide in the bathroom cause they aren't supposed to have ladies in the room after 11pm. (Did I mention this apartment complex was on a Baptist university campus?) Yeah, so then we sneak out, darting into a series of other rooms. I hide in a girl's apartment until I see that the police car has driven off. I hung out a bit more with some of the guys, then went on home.     Saturday    I was in the lab by 9am. Then I was at judo practice by 11am. Then to the dad'd place where I learned that their clothes dryer conitues to tumble even after its done. Its this neat little thing they call wrinkle guard. I didn't know this at first, so it took me HOURS to do my laundry. Its okay, I got to take a nap in there and converse with the grandparents.   After that, I went to hedish's where Kentesheia and Hebert were already waiting. We hung out for a few minutes and then headed over to Hilcroft to hit up the sari stores. We first went to this place called Roop's Sari Palace, I was like a kid in a candy store. SO many beautiful materials!! I have a few sari inspired cloths hanging around the apartment, they were about 15-20 bucks a peice and maybe 1x1 yard in size. These were 1x7 yards in size and from 15 to 25 bucks!! I bought two peices, and almost, ALMOST, bought one of the tunic things. I figure that I could wear the top with jeans and the bottoms with a black or white tank. I decided against it. The material was enough for the time being.   Then we headed over to Outfit Outlet. Cheap, chic clothes. Attempts at being chic in some cases. We found this lovely one peice outfit, pink with gray pin stripes. Sleeveless, attached belt, and these capri-ish bunched up pant things attached. Hideaous. But I got a shirt I really liked for about $10 bucks.   We headed back to my house. I figured out where to put the sari material and we went to Niko Niko's for some good food. And in line, there at NikoNiko's I saw a girl wearing a dari tunic top with jeans. OH!!! I should have bought it!! I'll be back, oh yes, I will be back. The food there is delightful, the lamb is just fabulous. Hedish the Hippie wouldn't know though, seeing as how she has gone vegetarian on us. TELL IT TO THE CHEETAH.   We got back to Slick Foot's nick of the woods and rented "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun", this movie from the 80's. It was so great and terrible. The dancing was fun, the plot was, well, there, and the acting, oh my word. "Oh, so you're like the authority on stretching now too?" Yeah, dialogue like that. Georgeous. The dancing though was really great.   Slept there.     Sunday    Didn't wake up until about 11am!! I never do that. SHipley's for breakfast, the only way to go. Krispie Kreme can bite me, Shipley's is hands, feet, and ass down the best for donuts and kolaches and all that jazz. So I eat and head out to home. I take a shower, put my old clothes back on (well, I change the undies at least) and head to work. I'm there for, oh, three hours, go home, go to mom's to hang with her for about an hour, then go to dad's and hang with him for about an hour, get some paintings from Grandma, and head back home. There I hang the paintings, hang the saris, and actually CLEAN!!! Whoa!! I still need to vacuum. I hate vacuuming the most of all, I don't know why, I think its the sound. I still don't make it to the gym. I go to bed instead.     Monday    Lab work, wheee.. I was at the lab until about, oh, 7-ish? I've been putting longer and longer hours in. I figured this would happen as I get further and further into my research. And its only begun. Partly though cause i'm trying to juggle my experiments, the intern's work, and my more administrative duties. Its all good though.   That night Ping hosted a dinner at her apartment for me and the interns. Sergio got lost for about half an hour trying to get to her apartment, and Mildreth was bringing the boyfriend too so they were just late. The food was too much! She made a shrimp pancake sort of thing, shrimp and veggies, salmon, beef, and hot and sour soup. She also gave us veggies and dip for before and had a plethora of snacks for after. After&nbsp;a while Sergio had to pick up some friends at the theater and Ping convinced him to bring them back here and finish off the food. They loved it too.  &nbsp;  Around that time Mildreth's boyfriend, Richard, had to leave. Left behind was Sergio and six women. So, as estrogenic environments tend to do, the conversation turned towards relationships and such related topics. I glanced over at Checo and he looked like he wanted to die. I asked if he would survive and he said he needs to be holding a beer or something. Ha!  &nbsp;  I have pics of Friday night on a new photo album place. I'm going to see if I can get it to link there, cause you might have to sign in or something. When I get pics of other things, I'll post them as well.    urlLink Try This

      Its the little quirks about people and the strange things they will do that just make me laugh sometimes. So let me just say "Hello" to all those who are out there reading this. Drop me a line. Tell me what you think. ^_^  I tried to write in this last nite, but my computer crashed and so I lost it all. Oh well. Yeah, I know its my playlist, but I still get excited when Janet Jackson's "Escapade" and Shakira's "Ojos Asi" play on my winamp. I turn it up and just dance like mad around my apartment. Part jazz, part ballet, and part palsy-girl. Another nice thing about living alone.   Today is a hectic day. Its 4:15 and the interns still have work to do. I can't really leave until they get their work done. And I have to go to judo practice cause, well, I need to get good and I'm hoping to entice Guy in a trip to College Station on Sunday for a practice. He's mentioned how he's like to do that and grab a Guiness afterwards. Ooo-la-la. You know how I like my Guiness. ^_^ And, goodness, what a cutie.   My favorite part of the workday, aside from going home, is when I first get into the lab. I'm always the only one there for at least an hour, so I can turn up the music, sing along loudly and badly, and dance around.   This weekend should rock, if all things go according to plan. I'll keep you updated. And with my leaving let me tell you a parable:  There once was a girl who thought that climbing trees was really fun. She always wanted to climb a skinny tree and have the branch bend back over to the ground like she had seen in the movies and cartoons. So one day she found a great skinny tree and went to give it a shot. As she climb further out on the branch she felt the branch bend and she got excited and climbed out faster. Suddenly there was a loud crack and she came crashing to the ground. It hurt.   Moral of the story: Don't climb trees after a  powerhour  and don't believe the things you see on TV.

      Short weeks are good, but that means that Tuesday has taken the place of Monday:  1) I forgot to tell the interns to passage the cells high so that we could make sure to have enough cells for the westerns later this week.   2) I ate greasier left over Mexican food before judo practice and that isn't a smart thing to do.  Note to follow: My adversary showed up at practice today. I should practice with her, thats the only way I will ever learn to beat her. I know I can.   3) Guy wasn't at practice today. I want to suggest going to College Station this Sunday for a judo practice. He has expressed intrest in doing that and then grabbing a Guiness or two. Hopefully he'll be there Thursday.   4) I didn't finish all my work during the day, so here I am, at the lab, at 12:30am, finishing up my work to insure that my cells will survive. I'll come in later tomorrow.   5) I realized I should start to pay attention to my food intake again. I also realized that my missing the gym quite often these days is taking it's toll on my tone. No good can come of this.   But I have some things to look forward to this week. Namely, that it won't be a Monday (Tuesday) anymore after this. And that I can go home and go to bed. G'nite. OH! I'm gonna burn me an 80's CD mix too!!

      Note to all who are aware:  Short grain white rice, if left undisturbed for about two days, will turn into a formless, pink kitten, eyes still shut.   But to fight this formless, pink kitten will only bring on more terror. But things usually get messier before they get better. I thought I could fight the good fight with all purpose surface cleaner spray, but then realized that upon shooting the animal with said substance, it emitted a cloud of spawn. I then had to spray down the air and surrounding surfaces to make sure I neutralized this counterattack. This is a kitten to be reckoned with.   In situations like this, you have to be tough. Kinda like a Glad Trash Bag.   This kitten wasn't going down with out a fight. This required some tougher maneuvers. So I took the rice cooker's bowl and turned it over int he sink, turned on the hot water and proceeded to blast down the forming nuggets of terror from the air. I then ran to the computer to consult a comrad. After much deliberating, I took the next step. Leaving on the hot water, I slowly turned the bowl back over and filled the basin with water, intending to drown the sucker. When the creature was finally fully submerged, I added some soap to the concoction and filled it to the rim.   Currently, I'm letting this marinate in the soap, the ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIKITTEN DISH SOAP.   And that, my friends, is the end of Sloopy. Sloopy hung on as long as it could.

      Its 9:30 AM on Thurdsay.  AND HEDISH HAS ALREADY WRITTEN IN HER BLOG!!!    I got word the other day that my entire blog entry was underlined. Oops. Html fails me again.   Last nite we had an international buffet pitluck dinner at Husky Village in Houston Baptist Univeristy. Thats where the interns are staying while they work here. I brough sushi, Ping brought a few chinese dishes, Mildreth made a whole slew of homemade Mexican food, Richard made a rice and shrimp thing, and Sergio made a mango smoothie for dessert. It was all so fabulously wonderful. The Mexican food, its true, isn't anything like what you find in the restraunts. Its so much better.   Then I had brought a bottle of wine for with/after dinner, and being the smart one I am, i didn't bring a bottle opener. We tried to use a fork, a knife, and even tweezers to get that cork out and nothing worked. Them Sergio showed me and Ping their fashioned Bachelor Pad, where they all pooled money, bought a TV and a poster. Once we went in a bunch of the guys started ragging on Sergio for not inviting them to the dinner. They were really funny. Then he pointed to a sign they wrote and was like "Whats that say?" So I translated it and everyone is like "Whoooaaa....". Hey now, I grew up in Texas. I can at least read Spanish.   It was almost 1am when Ping and I left, thats way past my bed time. I took alot of the Mexican food home, shoot, thats what I'll be having for dinner and lunch for a few days.   On another note! I got my official acceptance to the graduate school yesterday! The letter on the the official letter head of A&M and all that jazz. Its going up on my wall! I'll start classes in late August. Yay!!! I really think classes are just what I need to rejuvinate my passion towards research, cause it really has been waning recently. I see myself being a professional student, and eventually a prof. I'll just hang out in academia for the rest of my life. ^_^  Okay, I need to start trying out my Spanish, for serious. I should tell Mildreth and Sergio to kick me or something everything I don't at least try. ^_^ I'm such a pansie. Whats wrong with me?!?! I'm NEWMAN for goodness sake! Whats Newman afraid of?? Nothing!! What can Newman do?? ANYTHING SHE DAMN WELL PLEASES!! Okay, thats my pep talk to me. ^_^

      I would like to begin in the fashion of displaying a new dream home. I think most people know I would love to end up (settle down, if you will, though I hate that term) in Colorado Spring eventually. Well, I beleive I have found the house that will work for me. You can take a gander at it  urlLink HERE . You have to take a look at the pics through the house. I would change the decor a bit, but all in all, its great. I wonder how far it is from the OTC? I wonder what kind of biotech and research facilities are in Colorado Springs?   Now its time to recap my adventures of the past weekend:  Friday nite I was dying. I was exhausted, cramping, irritable. Between the judo muscle aches, female muscle aches, and a friggin' long week of work, I crashed at around 10pm. Saturday I felt so much better. Good thing too since it was a crazy day. First there was judo practice (Gomez stands me up once), then I go home to take a shower, realize I left my make up and jewlry at Mom's, go to work face-less, drive back to my mom's, put my face back on, and go to Hedish's. I don't get there until, what, 5:30? Everyone is already out of the pool, but there is still some food left. I have a sausage dog, a cookie and some of the wonderful sweet bread Hedish's friend makes. Mmmmmmm...... I hang out there for about an hour, then we all head to our respective areas to prepare for the festivities of the nite.   Ash and I go to my place to drink some coffee and prep. I decide to go stripper, so I don my pinstripe pants and the lacey tank I got a few weeks ago. People say I still don't look like a stripper. Damn it! Well, Adam and his friends pick us up and head over to Navid's rug shop. He has this big van with no back seats, rolls out a rug on the floor and surrounds it with pillows. Make-shift harem room. Everyone meets there and we ride in style downtown. The drinking starts at Flying Saucer where we also begin the sugar packet wars. Good times.   Then the party moves to Slante (sp?) Pub (Gomez stands me up twice) which also has a dance floor and balcony on the second level. I knew the bartender-ess from high school and get my Long Island super strong and free. Oh goodness, thats all I needed all nite. We mostly hugn out on the balcony there, watching the people and the lights, cooing at the Rice Lofts. Someday, when I'm fabulously well-to-do....   It was just a really great time, hanging out with good friends in Houston. Change of scenery from the small town College Station life. We really need to do that more often. After the downtown, several of us head back to my place to mix our own drinks and hang out. We are there until about 5am! Brian, Jay, and Darby leave, Hebert and Chuck crash at my place (no shape to be driving) and of course, Ashley stayed with me.   Hebert and Chuck left at around 11 in the morn, and the mother calls at 11:15-ish, so I figure I might as well get up and shower. A shower, a meal bar, and a large mug o' coffee later, and I'm starting to feel back to normal. Ash and I head to HEB for a few things (I picked up my hair dye... eep!) and meet Hedish and Hebert at Niko Niko's for lunch/dinner. We are there for a long time, rehashing the nite and all our dramas. Such as girls will do. Then we leave and I meet the mother back at my apartment. I leave her there so I can take Ash back to her car for her to get back to College Station.   Back at my apartment, while my mom works on her school stuff, i pass out for a bit. So tired. I wake up to find her cleaning my apartment. I mean really cleaning. My toilet, my sink, moping the floor, washing more dishes, my word. I won't complain, but me makes me feel like I live like a pig.... Anyways, after that we head to HEB and then she goes home. (Gomez stands me up a third time) I go to work to play with my cancer, go home, and get to bed about 1:30am.   Now I'm here. Tonite I plan on doing the hair thing. Just the under side, I only want it visible when my hair is in a pony tail or a bun or something. I'm turning in my class registration papers today, for a grad level cancer bio course from UTH. Pretty exciting!!   I think its about lunch time now. I'm outta here.

      So I'm just writing here and there as the inspiration comes.  -----------------------------  Guy, Bob, and I are driving through Taco Cabana when Guy sees an older Asian man walking through the parking lot. "I bet he's Japanese," he says. "No, they are all Chinese or Korean here," I try to explain. "No, no, he's definately Japanese." So he rolls down the window and yells out at him, with a thumbs up sign mind you, "Japan rocks, man! Japan rocks!" The old man looks at him, shrugs, and gives a thumbs up sign back.   ---------------------------   Me : The guys get a shower, washer and dryer, lockers, everything!  Guy : But come on, how many girls do we really have at Diamondback. You and....?  Me : Still....  Guy : Well, when we built it, I put lots of loving care into every detail of that women's locker room!  Me : Suuuurree...  Bob : So what  is  is in the women's locker room?  Me : A toilet, a sink and ALL THE CLEANING SUPPLIES!!  ---------------------------  At Bob's before we head out, I'm come back to the living room from the bathroom, and Guy has his arms crossed and has a peculiar expression on his face. "What are you up to?" I ask. "Oh nothing, watching TV." (Its off.) "Um... just turn around for a second." I say "Ooookaayy... I'll just have some of my quesadilla." As I turn around to open the box I hear a crunching sound coming from the couches. I open the box and THERE IS A SLICE MISSING!!  ---------------------------  At the Chicken, I asked Guy when he wants to head out, cause he's the one that has to be up so early in the morning. "Oh, I don't care, how about after I finish this beer?" Thats fine with me, so I continute talking to my boys. After, maybe 15-30 mins he comes back over to the table and I'm surprised that the beer level in his glass hasn't changed. "Okay okay. After  this  one." "Oh, I thought you just hadn't taken a sip since we last talked," I say. "Damn, I should have gone with that one...."  --------------------------  "After meeting my friends, I figured you'd never want to go to La Strada again," says Theo. "Oh no," I explalin, "I just adored all the gay and fabulous men!"  -------------------------  "Yeah, you need to come back to College Station more," Jaime tells Guy, "the beer is cheap and the girls are really cute." I reply with "Sure, but the guys aren't much to look at...."  -------------------------

      I'm talking to Kasuki online, and my head is spinning already. I sure do miss Japanese, Japan, that whole adventure. Damn, I wish I knew some Japanese around here that I could practice with, study again. Damn, why am I letting this slip away??   "What will you do now that you know this? Will you just go home and forget?"   I'm afraid thats what happening! No, I can't let you down.   Post doc, has to be in Japan. As soon as I figure out how my finances will work as a graduate student, I want to look into some real Japanese classes. Spanish would be easier, but really, am I ever going to live in Mexico or Spain?? Japan! Thats way more likely!  Actually, Germany is my second choice for post-doc, but I think that I could pick that up quickly cause its so English-esque in nature. So I won't worry with studying that unless I find I'll be definately going there.   I'll write more later, gotta take care of some work things.
