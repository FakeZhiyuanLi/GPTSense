       urlLink Teeter Toot's Blog   A day in my office, is pretty slow. Except for the occassional fired up customers wondering where the hell their parts are at...why we haven't come out yet... etc. ... etc.... Need I explain more... pretty boring.   I spend most of my day "secretly" talking to Enric online and over the phone... boredom only goes so far, and we are always up to getting to know eachother better. At least he has a computer at home.  June 2nd.  Remember that date. That's when Enric and I started.
