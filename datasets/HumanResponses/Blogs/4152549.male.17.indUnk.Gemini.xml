      I know I just got back into this thing, but looks like I'm gonna have some more time off. On Tuesday I leave for New York, and I won't be back for about two weeks. So, that should give everyone some time to catch up on all the  commenting  that you've apparently put off. It's okay, I'm not furious. Better late than never, I always say.  So, I'm going to the  urlLink Big Apple . No. More like the little apple. Or maybe some kind of mandarin orange. I  might  get to go to NYC, but that's pretty unlikely. Instead, I get to stay in the lively city of  urlLink Ilion  (I think it's actually considered a 'town,' which is, I believe, somewhere between the ranks of 'city' and 'campsite'.) To give you a clear mental image of this...er...city, I'll have to...well...You've all seen  urlLink The Andy Griffith Show , right? Ya.     Ah, Mayberry   I'll still have limited access to the internet through local libraries and such, so hopefully I'll be able to update a few times while I'm there. The good news is my dad is allowing me to use his work laptop, which is good for two reasons. First, I can play games and DVDs on it when I become inevitably bored. Secondly...Well I guess there was only one good reason for it, but it's a great one.  This trip should give me time to get off this freaking box and out of the house, but more importantly it should give me opportunities to play poker, as my relatives love the game. That alone is preventing me from dreading the journey. But I guess there's nothing I can do about it but sit in my rocking chair on the porch and wave to the familiar faces walking by.  See you all in two weeks if the plane doesn't go down.

      There's really no interesting headline news today. I keep checking back into Yahoo and CNN to see if something interesting has come up that doesn't involve some city in Iraq that no one can pronounce, but all they're really doing is rearranging the words in the articles' titles and changing the 'last updated' time every hour to prevent anyone from realizing they're lazy. Not that being lazy is so horrible in most cases, but I'm calling the shots here.  So, screw the news. I was looking through a recent entry at  urlLink gapingvoid  and saw a link that caught my eye. For those of you who are unaware of gapingvoid, which would be everyone reading this, it's a blog made by...what's-his-name...who started a business scribbling punchlines on the back of business cards.     Copyright what's-his-name, blah blah blah.   No, there's no catch, so don't ask. I have no idea what his customers are thinking. Regardless, on to the point. The link that I saw was entitled " urlLink The Sex and Cash Theory ." Needless to say, I clicked immediately. At first I was disappointed in seeing that it contained no advice on how to get either one, but I read it anyways. It proved to be much more valuable than any money making advice, and...well, I still wish it had sex advice, but you can't win 'em all. The basic idea that I got out of it is that everyone is constantly trying to plan their career and figure out what they can do that will pay the bills (Cash) and still give them satisfaction (Sex). Most people spend their entire life trying to work towards an easy balance between the two - maybe a lucky break or a 'self-discovery,' or maybe they plan to work their way up to that level. What they don't realize is that as soon as they come to grips with the fact that there will  always  be work that you don't want to do, and agree to accept it, it becomes a lot easier. This can be applied to anyone in any situation, so hopefully someone out there stayed awake up to this point.  I'm sure you're all sick of reading by now, so I'll end it here. Besides, I don't want to reveal too much of my [ urlLink stolen ] wisdom at once.

      Okay, I haven't written an actual entry in a long time, so I'm a little rusty. However, I know that I can't just all of a sudden transition from my absence back into my normal routine in one post. This takes at least two. There are, I'm sure, a few questions on everyone's minds.  First thing's first. What happened while I was gone? Absolutely nothing. If you know me at all, you know that my life is completely uneventful, and you wouldn't be asking yourself that question. If you were wondering about that, you must be new. Welcome.  Now, what will I write about? In my last Xanga post I briefly mentioned some changes I plan to make in my style. To be honest, though, I'm not quite sure exactly. For the most part, I'm planning on writing my opinions (a.k.a. the truth) on certain articles I read online, things I see on T.V., and stuff I hear people say. (Yes, 'people' includes you, so prepare to feel offended if you decide to express a controvertial or hilariously idiodic view around me.) The only problem with this is that I know a lot of people could care less about that stuff. If you're one of those people...I don't really know what to say. 'Sucks for you' is the first thing that comes to my mind, though. One thing that I'd like to bring up is that I encourage people to tell me what they want me to write about. If you like something on here or don't like something on here, seriously tell me. This site is not for me, it's for you.  I am going to try to write in the same sarcastic/cynical way I used to, so don't worry about that changing. And I will still write about the same type of stuff that I used to, just not as much. I'm going to refrain from such topics as 'What I did today' and 'The new video game I bought.' I know that I don't care when someone else writes about that stuff, so why should they care when I do. (No offense to all the losers who still write about that...)  I think that pretty much covers the transistion.  The first thing that I'd like to comment on is the death of Rick James. You should all know him as the man made infamous by  urlLink Dave Chappelle . Oh...I guess writing Super Freak and U Can't Touch This, and thereby defining the Funk genre, helped too...but this is the 00's, no one cares about that.     He died from 'existing medical problems,' 'a heart attack,' and 'natural causes.' They have yet to deliver a solid cause, so it is safe to assume that it was related to drugs.  If anyone missed that bit of news, minimize  urlLink coffeebreakarcade  for a minute and type in http://www.cnn.com. I won't link you to it because you should get some practice typing it out. It's a  news  site that gives you access to the  outside world  if, like me, you rarely visit it.  Well, that's all the material I feel like using up for today. Gotta spread my topics out over several entries so I don't run out and look lazy.

      Due to the fact that Xanga is overrated and I'm sick of it, I've decided to move my website here. This will be the exact same thing as my Xanga urlLink  , but on a better program. If you, for some reason, have a problem with that then please tell me. I'll laugh at you, and I like laughing.  The reason I chose to switch to this is:  1. Xanga is mostly known as a place to express your innermost feelings and emotions and to inform your friends on what's going on in your life. That's not what I do this for. If you want to know that crap, ask me. I might tell you, I might not, but I don't need to be posting it for the world to see. Half the readers would be bored to tears, and I don't want that     on my conscience, now do I?  2. Blogger, or whatever this place is called, is way simpler and way more flexible. I actually understand how to edit the look and template of this site, and therefore am able to customize it.  3. It looks a lot less busy. Xanga had just about every inch of the screen taken up. That's completely  urlLink unnecessary . This looks more like a website, and less like a dating service profile.  I could continue to make up BS explanations as to why I moved, but the truth is I just want something different. I want to write, and I just wasn't feeling Xanga. Maybe this will work out better. Hopefully I'll start up on this soon. I will leave my Xanga up with a notification of the move and a link to this site, so don't worry about remembering the URL if you usually get to my Xanga though your subscription list. I'm trying to pull this off with as little hassle for the readers as I can. Tell me what you think...or what you don't think, whichever you prefer to do.  Oh, and vintage entries will be made available on  urlLink my Xanga .
