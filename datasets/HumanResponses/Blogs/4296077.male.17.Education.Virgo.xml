      Well, school is on the way, so I decided to use this opportunity to ask everybody on the reforms you guys think should be done to the American School System. What do you guys think about the "Zero Tolerance Policy"? I think to some extent is nothing but @#$^&* . I mean in some states kids have been expelled from school for ridicuolous reasons such as bringing GI Joe toy pistols that measure 1/2 an inch in campus, OR this other student was expelled from school for gesturing w/ his fingers  the shape of a pistol and saying "BAM!" to a teacher, OR another student was expelled from school because his ideas were not accepted by his teachers, thus the teachers accused him of being a theat to other students, OR a high-school student was suspended from school for trying to establish an Anarchy club in school, OR a fifth grade student was suspended for drawing a picture of the world trade center on fire, OR a student was expelled from school for bringing scissors to a sewing class, OR Seventeen Stratford High School students are suing the city of Goose Creek and the Berkeley County school district in federal court, alleging police and school officials terrorized them in a drug raid last month, OR some school districts are banning body art, OR a student was suspended for wearing a shirt which opposed military action in Afghanistan, OR elementary school students in some states are banned from playing tag because it's a game that could end in physical violence, OR some kindergaren students can't play with snow balls nor they can climb the sand-box mountain because they might want to push someone off, etc etc. Now, my point of view in regards to all these, is that the US govt. just wants to scare the #$@# out of people in order to be able to control them in an easier manner. When people are terrorized, it's more likely for them to accept to some extent the intrusion of the govt. in regards to certain aspects of their lives. I am not saying that "zero tolerance" is nto helpful, but come on going to extremes such as the ones mentioned above is just plainly ridiculous. They sound dumn, but they are actual evidence. I think that we are creating a new generation of kids which are going to be terrorized and are going to feel unsafe wherever they go. Is this the type of generation we want to create? One based on fear, insecurity, and terror? I just think it's wrong! What's your belief? Sincerely,                  JRdarkJester(Make Magic Happen).-

      Hey , hey, hey! Well I guess this in fact worked out nicely! I am yet not quite sure what to write in here, so I guess I'll just comment on the fact I am 100% Green/Democrat! I love ideologies  like anarchy , activism, fighting for ur rights , speaking ur mind, etc etc. I really love stuff like tattoes, piercings, and body art! I love rock music! My favprite bands are Metallica, Van Halen, Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi , etc, etc. I am into all types of rock: indie, punk, alternative, soft-punk, old school punk, EMO, old emo, Metal, new age, new wave, retroactive-rock, hair bands, garage rock, arena rock, clasic rock, GOTHIC, etc etc! I would like to live in a world full of peace and love, but unfortunately that is just a dream. I like to raise questions and I like o go deep into the essence of life! I like stuff like science, math, psychology, and astrology. I am a person that pretty much likes to "hang-out" with any single kind of people, i am very amicable Later!
