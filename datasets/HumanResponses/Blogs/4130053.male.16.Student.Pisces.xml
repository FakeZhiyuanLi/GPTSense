       .....cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry.   Five days since you laughed at me saying    get that together come back and see me.   Three days since the living room   I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you   Yesterday you'd forgiven me   but it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry     Yes! As the Barenaked Ladies song says, it's been 1 week. 1 long week in BC. It has gone flying by as I have been having so much fun! It has been an action packed week with tonnes of stuff to do! I ate Sushi for the first time, saw my first   CFL   game (GO BC!), played golf for the first time in 2 years, enjoyed take outs from   Boston Pizza   and   Dominos  ! U name it I did it!  Today we went to downtown Vancouver to visit the   Much Music Xbox Unleashed tour   and the   Yaletown Summer Celebration  . So we had trouble finding   City TV   (where   Unleashed   was) as  urlLink   Multimap.com    gave us really crap directions. When we finally found it, it was soooo crap we left after 5 minutes! All the   Xbox   games had been out for ages! So we left and went to Yaletown. It was really cool - so many classic cars and stalls! It was really fun to walk around!  We went to visit one of Dad's old employees Stefan, who manages the   Blue Water Cafe   in Yaletown. The restaurant is one of the most trendy and best places to eat in Vancouver, so when Uncle Nigel said we could go to the Sushi bar there, I was amazed! We had a Sushi platter which was so delicious, soooo much better than the takeaway. We sat at the bar where it was made and saw them prepare it. The Head Sushi Chef is one of the best in BC.   I bought some postcards (coming to a mailbox near you, soon! [I hope!]) to send and then went to   7-Eleven   to try their famous   Slurpee  ! It was really nice. I had   Pepsi   flavour. They're a bit like   Slush Puppies   or   Ice Blasts   in the UK but sooo much nicer!  Well after an eventful week, I'm amazed I still have money left! So BRING ON THE SPENDING!

      So I'm just back from watching    BC Lions    take on   Ottawa Renegades   in Canadian Football. The Atmosphere was absolutely amazing! Although they say the NFL is better than the CFL, I still truely enjoyed myself.  We left home at around 3pm and drove to Surrey to get the   SkyTrain   into Stadium station - where BC Place Stadium is - The Home Of The    BC Lions .   In itself, the   SkyTrain   is really cool, a bit like the   Docklands Light Railway   in London.  When we arrived the thing they called the "Street Party" more like the corner party (ha!) was getting underway. SO we walked around the shops for a bit and then came back for the party. I got to try a corn dog - which was relatively nice! - and got some free stuff.   The Beat 94.5   gave me some stickers, a lemon ice tea (nice!) and free months membership to a gym! Shame it ain't valid in England! I was also given a Subway football by DJ Big D which was cool. We made our way in and donated some canned food so I could have my photo taken with the Grey Cup - it is really big and cool! Just strolled around the concourse of the stadium and Uncle Nigel got me a free T-Shirt by signing up to a credit card! lol! I also got a programme and a    BC Lions    flag! Then we took our seats. They were really good - Row E seats 105 & 106! Really close to the bench.  The game commenced with the    Lions    coming out of a helmet with fireworks which was really dramatic! GO BC! GO BC! The    Felions Dance Squad    came out aswell, to a chorus of big cheers. They were hot! Lol! :P The Game kicked off and    BC    scored a touchdown early on. The match was even until the end of the 3rd quarter when    BC    dominated. There were some amazing runs and plays in the game and some really dodgy decisions by the refs! What do I expect - it's sports! In the end the Final Score was    BC Lions  47 - 27 Ottawa Renegades  ! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!      The atmosphere is sooooo different from an English soccer game down at The Valley, slightly lower attendence tonight of 25,000 but sooo different! Whenever a player got into the endzone a huge cheer broke, also if they made a good run, another broke. They had these mini games take place between games where prizes were won -   Save On Foods   Kick To Win, Catch to Win,   Air Canada   Flight Path,   Tim Hortons   Coffee Race, Go Kart Race etc! The cheerleaders often came on to dance on the pitch. Also   Subway   were firing the footballs into the crowd - but I already had mine! A car drove around throwing stuff out occasionally. The bench was so close to us too! I saw a player get really stressed and smash up the water dispensers on the table! Lots of Mexican Waves happened and there was a crowd cheer metre up on the screen that went up when people screamed - bulls**t I know but its fun! I found myself to get more into the game as it went on!  There were big screens around showing people in the crowd, and also   TSN   (sports channel) were broadcasting. I saw Uncle Nigel and I up on the screen a couple of times, and also the   TSN   camera filmed us! I know I was on Canada TV as the camera light was flashing red! I'm Famous Man! I'm Famous in Canada! OH MY GOD!  Came back home and had a pizza from   Boston Pizza   - delicious - Uncle Nigel was giving the gal in the shop hassle cos she didn't know what she was doing, bless her. She was really sweet! She also liked my hat! Come to think of it all of the Canadian women are sweet to me, maybe just cos I'm English, or maybe its because of my good looks! EH! Haha P.I.M.P  At least I watched my first CFL game with a win. So theres 1 thing left to say - GO BC! GO BC! GO BC!

      So I'm really having fun in BC! I have watched to wicked movies -   The Rundown   (  Welcome To The Jungle   in the UK) and   The Big Bounce   both if which were so funny! I have been shopping, bought my Sister's   iPod   and 12 packs of   Juicy Fruit.   I am loving all of the shops around here! I also got my   fido   sim card so I can make cheap calls.  So I've been listening to Mercury FM and Capital FM - sad I know but I can't get a radio station with all of the music I like on. The Beat and Z 95.3 are good, but I need UK music!! Hahaha. I'm listening to Mercury as I speak!  I'm off to shoot some golf balls at the Driving Range shortly. Tomorrow I'm off to the BC Lions vs Ottawa Renegades match at the BC Place Stadium, Vancouver - I'm really looking forward to that! There is a street party before which looks fun.  On Saturday, I'm hopefully going to the Much Music Xbox Unleashed show at City TV, Vancouver - this looks like I'm gonna see all of the latest games revealed! Also I'm going to the Yaletown festival which should be fun!  OMG I'm a criminal - I stood with 1 foot in USA and the other in Canada yesterday! hahaha!

      So I'm here in Canada and I have decided to start a blog! Im in Langley, BC having a great time.  The FLight over with Air Transat was pretty rubbish but at least I had a nice girl called Brittni and her Mum Leona to chat to! Thank god as I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo bored!  I played golf on my first day, Sunday, which I was crap at lol!!! The on monday I visited the Ski Resort of Whistler which was sooooooooooooo pretty! The views at the top of whistler mountain were so beautiful! I have some good pictures!  The shops in Canada are sooooo cool! I love all of the huge shops here - like  Golf Town  where you can get all of the golfing attire you need. Also I think  Radio Shack  is quite cool too and I bought one of their mini remote control ZipZap cars! Its pretty cool!! I also bought my Canadian Sim Card for my Mobile(Cell - man I've gotta talk Canadian!) Phone.  As Mc Donalds would say - BC I'm Lovin It  BTW The Time of this post is PT not GMT

      So this is my last post from BC Canada! I've had such a great time, but I am really looking 4ward to seeing everyone again! I'm not looking forward to the Air TransCRAP flight, but there ya go!  Weather has been good today! Bit overcast nowI went to Wal Mart and bought a pencil case and ruler for school! Cost me £1.50 so I was pleased!  Packed my suitcase, everything fits (thank God!). I came to work out the tax that I can claim back. THE STUPID CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ONLY ALLOWS TAX BACK ON PURCHASES OF $50 OR MORE. So I had Olivia's iPod and the fishing license recipts and thats it - $26.54 of tax - £8 roughly! Cheapskates!  So I'm off now to have the Salmon I caught on Thursday, BBQ Stylee!  **L8RS** OH CANADA!

      So, Uncle Nigel got a wasp sting and had to be taken into hospital this Friday as he had an allergic reaction to it. So, Aunt Linda took me home and said to order Pizza. I came to order the pizza so I tried my favourite Boston Pizza! I spoke to the girl who served us the other night, she remembered me as when she asked for telephone number I said I was visiting from England! 'I think you were in the other night and you ordered pizza and bread and I mucked the order up?!' Yeah, Hi, nice pizza though! 'Hey'. So when I told her the telephone number, she didnt understand when I said "double 3". 'It must be an English thing!" she said. I just think it's because she was thick! So I ordered the pizza, for an individual, and then she tells me I have to have a minimum order of $17.99. As it was individual it was only $9.25. Gawd! So I thanked her and said it was only me who was eating!  I rang Pizza Hut, whose minimum was $10.00, but individual pizzas cost $3.95! Argghhh! So I ended up ordering a medium 'Canada, Eh?' pizza. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner for the next 3 days then lol!

      I'm just back from a day in Vancouver and I am absolutely knackered!  I got the SkyTrain into town after UN dropped me off - he played golf today! I got off at Stadium and went to the BC Lions offices as a guy (I think his name was Bill) had arranged to get me BC Lions & Felions posters. He brought them through and I shook his hand. He had got the Felions poster signed by Leah - a cheerleader - and gave me a Hall Of Fame BC Lions player autograph as well! That was so cool!  Walked up Robson after that and then had a Subway for lunch which was delicious! I went to Blue Water Cafe in Yaletown and had a drink with Stefan - very pleasant! He asked about Dad and told me what it was like living in Vancouver. After this I got back on the SkyTrain to Waterfront and then got on the SeaBus to Lonsdale Quay - this is well cool as it is a ferry that takes you over the water included in the travel pass!!!! Took some photos of Vancouver from there.  Then I got back on the train to Metrotown - a huge shopping district! I got a Roots bag for school, really nice and only $34.00 (13 quid!) and a Roots Canada T-Shirt. Roots is a leading brand name in Canada!  I eventually made it back to King George to meet UN. I was SO tired! AL and I had Boston Pizza when we got back - sooooo nice! :D  On Monday we went Whale Watchin which was so cool! We were really close to the Whales and it was really fun!  Tuesday golfed again with next door neighbour Pat and his son Jordan. they beat us by +1 but I had improved, especially my putting!
