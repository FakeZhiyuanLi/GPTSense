      SYDNEY!! Alas, I have failed. I promise to come and visit as soon as possible. I want to come up on my birthday as I mentioned on the phone. Yeah, I stay up until 3 in the morning wondering who is going to be lazy and steer clear of every watering hole with me. Sometimes I go 4 or 5 days without showing in hopes that you will return. Take this week for example....I haven't bathed yet. I'm so mad that you can walk into the 7/11 and buy cigarettes. GRRRR! It seems that all of my hopes and dreams of getting more are obliterated. Stop getting lost in the city Sydney! I will have your head for this, and possibly your legs. BTY SYD, you make too many generous offers. I will be up when I can pay for my own food and gas and I promise that will be in the near future. Sorry I haven't been online in such a while. I was moving in and out of various homes. But it seems now that I must retire and go clean one of these homes of my choice. I will write more when the time comes.

      Mom came by tonight. She hastily grabbed the rest of her wardrobe and some spices out of the kitchen. She left the gun the she had "borrowed" from my stepdad and a note on his pillow. The note stated something about her loving him always and him having some kind of exitence in her dreams. What poop that is. It makes my stomach cringe in hatred and ambiguous fear. Ame, did you go to class tonight? I saw your van at your house. Syd, did you call me tonight? You said you would. It's unusually crazy how my mother still dotes upon me. It's funny that she can ruin something so sacred and then pretend like nothing ever happened. Ah, works of the devil I suppose. Do you think it's easier to read title font than it is all caps? Take a look, EGGS or Eggs. Which on is easier for you. I prefer Eggs. I've gained ten pounds in the last couple months. I think it's because I've done nothing but sit around my room all day. Tonight I had promised myself that I would go walking but instead I opted to watch LOTR, or shall I say Lotr. I've decided that I might take some classes this fall at SVCC. I'm still undecided because I figure if I make it into VCU I better work alot and save some money.I looked up just now and spotted my graduation rose. That thing has been dead for at least 2 weeks and I still haven't thrown it out. Laziness is a virtue in some cases. That blasted AudioBlogger won't let me do anything until I purchase some posts. I should've know. They finally got their fannies up there and cut the power on at the new house. It's only taken them 3 weeks. So we got this new Chinese restaurant in town, that makes two. So the owners of the first Chinese place got mad/jealous because they felt that "Yong's", the second place, was stealing all of their business. So they ride down there and raise cane. I think that's funny. Is that constitutional? Im so excited that Doris got our hotel room for Nashville. I have recently named the trip "Nashville". Aren't you swollen with pride? She's so apprehensive of letting Ame go but she still got us the room. Oh man, I hope she doesn't decide to come along. No offense Doris but it's kind of a no mom thing. You know what else is a no-mom thing, demanding that your daughter say "I love you" when she doesn't. Definately no-mom. I better hit the sheets, hence don't wake me up unless I tell you that you can.

      Ah yes, so starts our andventures of today. My stepdad woke me up around 7:30am because I had an ortho appoint. at 9am. That is namely the worst thing anyone could do. I could've gotten up aroun 8:30 but he wouldn't have it. So on the way to the office (I've always wanted to say that) I ran a red light because it was raining like some stuff and I knew I couldn't stop in time. I have to make this quick so I can join a friend on this dinner date I arranged, at Subway. So then I went to look for a job and filled out on app. at Family Dollar. Wow...no matter what you think the place is pretty illusive. That's a good sentence. Ah, erroneous, articulate statements...it's just not me. I'll inform you later.

      I felt like doing my country some good so I decided to drop in on Ame while she was watching Garfield. It was cute. I felt bad because she went all alone. I'm a good patron. Sometimes I get this weird feeling that my life is utterly disingenuous. Maybe it's because I don't shave my pubic hair into a mohawk, I don't rightly know. Let me tell you about my illogical adventures today. This morning I woke around 10 and ate a bowl of cereal. I remember reading in BOP magazine that Justin Timberlake couldn't function without his cereal. Ah, the things I recall. I took a bath and went to unpack at the new house, then I had to poop so I came back here and did that. I went back to the house and fiddled around a bit with some clothes and wire coat hangers. No, I didn't abort a baby, just hung some clothes. After I had accomplished what I could I ate a chicken sandwich and watched 28 Days starring Sandra Bullock. That movie just makes me stare at the wall. I then randomly decided to go watch Garfield with Ame because I remebered she told me that she was going alone. After sitting through 45 minutes of screaming babies and whining fathers I journeyed to Food Lion. I resentfully purchased some kitty litter and a quart of Starbucks Coffee Almond Fudge ice cream. What a mistake that was. I think I've eaten the entire thing. I detest having a cat in heat. The thing keeps rubbing its pootie all over everthing. I'll have to scour the furniture tomorrow. I think I called my mother a whore today. It was so refreshing. I really miss my sister. She seems so distant now that she's moved out. Physically, yes, but moreover emtionally. It makes me feel all secluded. We used to play this game called "Granny and the Butt." We would get this huge blanket, I would play the part of Granny and wrap the blanket around me and she would get on all fours under the blanket, crawl behind me and coincidentally be identified as  "the Butt". I loved that game. I would turn a corner and she would hit her head. Those were the days.

      AWWW MAN!!! I don't get to go to Richmond soon! I wish that I wasn't poor, then I could go to the city anytime I darn well pleased. I'm in the process of moving. Well, I've been in the process of moving for the past 3 months but now  it's real.  Anyway, I saw  Bucklin  today at Wal*Mart, he actually acknowledged my existence. Not that I care, he's a loser anyway. There is not one cotton-pickin' piece of toilet paper in this whole house. OH! I saw "Day After Tomorrow"! Wow....that one was a good one. It was so realistic. I actually thought it would be snowing when I walked out of the theatre. Ame and I played Star Wars in the park beforehand. No, not before it started to snow, before the movie. There was this family having a cookout too. I pretended they were all droids...don't tell Ame that. Mom's boyfriend keeps calling her on her cell phone while I'm around. They just don't care! They throw their hands in the air! Mom told me to meet her at Wal*Mart at noon. She shows up at 1:30 talking on the phone with her boyfriend. GRRRRRRRRRRR! I wonder what it is like to be a groupie. Do they still exist? I hate that Christmas commercial for M&Ms. You know, "He does exist," "They do exist." Why the hell is Virginia for lovers? That has got to be the most idiotic slogan. I need to get a job...alot. Any suggestions. I was born a unicorn and i put my crystals under his pillow. OH WOW!!! I ALMOST FORGOT!!! I was looking at sheets in Wally World and this middle-aged guy randomly walks up to me. He didn't say anything for the longest time so you know I had the right to feel pretty uncomfortable. So then I walked into the next isle and tried to focus on these pillows and there he comes. So then I turned to him and said "Can I help you?" and he says "Yeah you can, I am looking for something that would look good on my bed." and I said "Sir, I don't work here." and he says "I know." So then I tried to be polite and everything and I said "Like some sheets?" AND HE SAYS, "No like you." Oh wow. I got out of there real fast, right after calling him a "SICK @$%*er!" Anyway, I thought it was a prerry good story. Well...I might not have the internet for a while so enjoy this crappy blog.

      Current Mood: Anxious Yet Apprehensive Current Music: Day Tripper- The Beatles  Guess what! I bought The Da Vinci Code tonight. I figure I'll start on it sometime in the future. I just realized that I am moving out tomorrow. Of course, I'm going to live with my mother (again) and I don't want to at all. Why am I not 18? I have recently finished watching American Wedding, what a movie that is. So predictable yet, it tries so hard not to be. I think my emotions can be best explained in the song "Yeah" by Usher. Is'nt that the way we all feel? I'm going to have a pretty eventful summer this year. June 30th I plan to visit Richmond where I will be checking out what they call a VCU. THEN....get ready...July 27th I'm off to Nashville, TN to a concert. The one the only....Hanson. Wow. All you need is love and you are what you eat. Did you know that Incense means to annoy. What an oxymoron. I don't know what else I'll be doing. Ah yes, finding another job. I hated working at Food Lion...never do it. Just ask Sydney, she'll know. And when you do it speak in complete sentence fragments. This one is boring as some stuff.

      I watched Donnie Darko, finally. What a great psychological thriller. It was such a mind boggler. No, not mind blogger you crazies. Speaking of psychological thrillers, I'm sitting in a towel. I love taking really refreshing showers. No Ame, eyebrows do not add to the protection from germs getting in your eyes, that's crazy talk. Aww, I've made freinds with Syd's boyfriend. He's so much like her but not. Anyway, I bought Tommy Boy on DVD and I think I'm sort of excited about it. MMMMM....sarcasm, it keeps 'em in line. Well I better get my black @$$ off of here and go get some soap for the dishwasher.

      Remember that game where you write down your name and the name of your crush and then you add up all the letters that the names share. Ah yes, a little game called "Flames." I used to play all the time and I acutally thought it determined my fate but then i realized that I couldn't have sex with every crush. So I think that I am going to VCU in the spring. Ah Richmond, city of...culture. I received a guitar on my 16th birthday and I just realized that I cannot play it. I've had it for two years and all I know are a handful of chords and bits and peices of random songs. I actually wanted to learn how play. I'm putting cheap spinners on my car just to give myself a good laugh. They sell them at Wal*Mart. Do you ever wonder about random unsystematic things? Like, the other night about 2:30 I wondered, "What is the reasoning behind eyebrows?" You know, things of that nature. Really, why do we have eyebrows and why is it socially acceptable to pluck them? I'm going to work at Wal*Mart here soon. Why the hell is it illegal to purchase alcohol after midnight? Is it illegal? Do you think that in the future people will have to pay for toilet paper. In 20 years from now when you go into a public restroom will you have to deposit 50 cents into the toilet tissue dispenser? What if you have the runs? That would be a pretty expensive dump. Did you know that if you type the word "poop" on Microsoft Word® it won't give you a synonym. So I get on Microsoft Word® when I type entries to find bigger synonyms for my dinky words and to check my spelling. Right now my Microsoft Word® Document reads "Random illegal poop." I find that to be quite entertaining and yes, I tried to find another word for poop. I would've loved to have lived back when the Beatles were huge. I wonder what the world was like. What's more I wonder how I would've veiwed the world. I want to meet Steven Tyler. Wow... I wish it was possible to be somebody else for a day. No, none of that Switched tv show crap, actually be them. I would eat alot of bad things and get like 345 tattoos of random naked politicians all over my body. I would clear my bank account and fly to Italy and Ancient Greece. By the way my document now reads, "Random illegal poop tattoos." That's probably the most unintentional creative thing I've ever invented. Remember that song that came out back in '97 about Sunny coming home and getting some tools and going to the kitchen? Man, I loved that song along with "One Head Light" and "MMMBOP" and "Bitch." I was 11. Man, those were the days. I think Micheal Jackson actually had a face back then. Remember that Rod Stewart song "Forever Young?" Remember the video? He was holding the little kid in the back of a truck or something going down the road. It's 3:05 am. I feel like going for a drive.

      Well I must say that tonight (noun) was the best thing that has happened in a while. It was so soul revivng to spend time with ones that make you happy.  Good ole Donnie, I love you, you know that? Zack, Zack, Zack. Ame, someday we have to make out or something. I love you guys. You make my heart say, "Finally!" I have conCOCKted a master plan for this year. Work alot and play music alot.  Also, I need to retake my SATs. "Lord, if you're up there bless me reasoning skills and good judgement, Amen."  I need Zen in my life. I need something to calm and balance me. I figure in a year I will have saved enough money to help me get through college. I hate that I will be a year behind but it's not like high school or anything so I guess I'll be fine. I need to do things in my own good time. What the hell, apathy or laziness will always conquer. NOT ANYMORE. I'm changed....in a way.  I like apathy it makes me heave a sigh of relief. SYDNEY!!! I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!! Come and be with me...

      *sighs* If you have nothing to lose your'e losing everything aren't you? What an overly introverted question. I don't know how long this has been going on but I just realized that I have nothing and the more I think about it the worse it becomes. When I look back at my life I see a shitload of oppurtunities. What the hell have I done? Do I have bad judgement?  Am I too spontaneous?  For example,I recieved 1,000 dollars for graduation. I could've used that money for a new car. I could've used it to help me through college. But what did I do, hell i don't even know what I did with it all.  It's all a blur. 9 times out of 10 I feel like there is nothing in this hell hole of a world to live for. What hurts the most is living everyday knowing that I could be something better but not being willing to make it better.  How in the name of all that is good have I been depressed for more than half of my life and not have done anything about it? I don't even fucking feel anymore. I concentrate on nothing most of the time with the underlying feeling of hatred for myself.  My fucking head hurts. I hate this.  I hate writing in this god damn blog. It's not theraputic in any way. Fuck this.

      I want out of here. I want to play with the best of them. I want the world to hear my stupid songs, the ones named "Lucy In My Lap" and "Wear The Penguin Shirt." I want to always be tidy and lazy at the same time. I want a million candles for a quarter a piece.  I want pizza to be good for you like carrots are. I want to be skinny and deep. I want new underwear. I want to be kissed. I want long dark hair. I want someone that likes the fact that I like Hanson's music. I want to go back and do everything right. I want to be healthy. I just noticed that the word healthy has "heal" in it. I want the people to know that I am more than what I am. I want someone to tell me that I taste like heaven. I want a mom. I want to lay with warmth. I want longer fingers.  I want a wish. I want to forever stay in out-of-state cheap hotels. I want out of here  .

      I left coffee in the coffee pot the other day. I dutifully promised Jeff that I wouldn't but I guess it slipped my mind. He quitely poured it down the sink drain staring out the kitchen window. I knew what he was thinking. He was thinking about mom, she used to leave coffee in the coffee pot all the time.  Wow that sounds like a really bad broken home novel. I promise my life isn't a broken home novel. I went walking today, the first time without Sydney or Ame. I pressured myself while making my way down Fincastle Ave. to walk up "the big hill." I turned the corner onto Tazewell Ave. and realized that I was subconsciously walking towards "the big hill." I walked half way up when I heard a familiar voice. "Crystal," Zack said with undoubted enthusiasm. I turned and smiled knowing that that any place on my body that could sweat was sweating. I get so uncomfortable when I'm sweating and the person I'm communicating with isn't. Anyway, we stood and watched a drunk propel a bulldozer into the nearest solid object. I decided to go into Donnie's. Excited to see me and my sweat Donnie hugged me dilligently. We talked a while about school and such. I ended up staying for a bit or two. At the end of our little chat Donnie offered to drive me back to the High School. We said our goodbyes and that was that. So the other night Sydney and I opted to go walking. We coincidentally end up at Ame's house and she joined us. As we made our way back to the high school I ever-so-boldly thought that black humor was African American humor. Lordy Lordy Look Who's 40.  I was corrected and finally realized that I should pay more attention to...everything.  We went to Sonic and I paid for some treats. It felt so good to actually pay for something. I'm a bum. I mentioned a couple firsts while Syd and Ame shooks their heads. Now comes the climax of our friendship. We rode over to the Family Dollar and lo' and behold there it stood in all it's magnificant glory a 3-horsed merry go 'round machine thingy. After searching my car we found the quarter that would change everything as we knew it.  Ame was a little reluctant initially but she got on with Syd and I as we rode with intense joy. After one ride i decided that I wasn't completely satisfied because I had not felt the vibrating pleasure that my horse had to offer.  I obtained more quarters, spilling my third Cherry Limade and manuevering between two trashcans in the process. We mounted the horses again while the classical music roared in our ears.  5 damn times we stayed on that thing. 5 damn times.  Syd hit her knee and we both ended up puking. On the way home Ame opted to tell me that every chance I get I bash her or someone in some way. I really don't understand that. What the hell Ame. I've never liked to put people down or hurt them in any way. You know if someone said that to you....I don' t want to talk about it. You know what your problem is, you take everything too seriously. And don't tell me that I'm insecure because you are too if not worse. There, I said it.  I can take it when people confront me about my problems but I sure as hell don't like it when a friend turns their problems into something that is my fault. Mom is currently in the Virgin Islands with her 55 year old viagra junkie bf. I bet she's having fun. Syd is on her way to Cancun. I called her earlier, the poor thing is jacked up on sleeping pills. Yes Syd, that is the fair outside your window. Ame is in D.C. I wonder what she is doing. I wonder if she is buying anything.  Alicia is in Pigeon Forge and decided to leave me with her dog. The thing takes a dump on everything. Speaking of dumps I need to go clean my room and get a job.  I also need to not be so i-n-s-e-c-u-r-e.
