        In my CD Player:   Blonde Redhead,  Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons      Currently reading:    Beneath the Wheel , Herman Hesse (so far: disappointing)    Quote of the day:    "To believe is to suffer.  It is like loving someone in the dark who never answers"  (from  The Seventh Seal )  This evening, I watched  Elephant  with Skinny.  I thought it was a fantastic film... Up until the point of the shootings, it reminded me so much of high school... The long tracking shots are really interesting - I forgot how much time I spent wandering the halls of Brebeuf, and how few people I spoke with (and how many I tried to avoid).  The minimalist dialogue and repetition of events is not only a way to build the characters (superficially, or externally - as the film doesn't pretend to show what any one person is thinking or feeling) but is also evocative of high school's day-to-day shit (that rarely deviates form the usual).  The reticent nature of the film is its strength, I think.  The soft piano is extra-diegetic (except when we actually see one of the boys playing in his home), but reminds me of the background noise of school:  perhaps someone practicing in the music room.  When I was in class, no one ever questioned the noises coming from outside:  the squeaking of someone's sneakers as they run down the hall, shouts, laughter.  A loud bang wouldn't have made us run right away.  When the killing begins, there's no glamour in it.  Although it is likely that a killing spree would make one's heart race, it certainly doesn't translate through the film - which I think is extremely clever.  For one, it doesn't allow us to choke on the actions of the film (filled with horror, though they are)... we remain thoughtful viewers from start to finish.  Also, it adds to the eerie and silent panic of the film.  It is the panic of ice in the bowels, and silence of incalculable sadness.  So that's it:  that is what is sloshing around in my head at one in the morning.  I'll have to think more about this film...

       Hello,      I'm WeirdLoverWilde, a.k.a. Juicy Jules, a.k.a. Hoola Hoolia, a.k.a. The Girl who likes Balls.        This whole Blog thing is very new to me - so please be patient.  I enjoy writing, so regardless of how  inane  some of my postings can (and will) be, they'll be updated fairly frequently.  Perhaps for every 95 random silly things I post, there will be an insightful word or two.      Here are some guarantees:  eventually I'll post a  picture  of myself, I'll likely write about books, music and film, as well as sexual fantasies, frustrations and conquests.  It should be  good times .        Stay tuned...
