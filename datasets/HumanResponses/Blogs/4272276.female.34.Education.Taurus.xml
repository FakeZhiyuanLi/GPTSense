      Today was the first official day of school for the 7th and 8th grade. So to celebrate we took them to a camp where we played games and introduced rules and procedures. I decided that it would be really good to go with them since I am a 7th and 8th grade teacher, and I have no idea really what the rules and procedures are. There were several other women teachers going along, and two male teachers. I started to realize that the two male teachers were also the bus drivers. I also started to be very nervous when I realized that most of the women teachers were getting on the bus with the girls, but no other teachers were getting on the bus with the boys.  So, I rode with the boys.  Thank goodness the ride to the camp was 5 minutes or less! Not that I don't like boys. But let's face it, a whole BUS load of 7th and 8th grade boys? I saw things that will stay with me for a long time. All in all it was really fun and I enjoyed getting to know the boys. At first they were really grossed out that a "girl" was on their bus, but by the end of the day they were telling each other "Hey, guys get out of the way, there's a lady coming through!" I'm so proud.  So boys, I hope you do well in my classes, and thanks for letting me hang out with you. (And I really hope you let that poor frog go. . .)

      It seems fitting that my first blog entry should be about the title. After all, if you didn't have an explanation of the title, you might be tempted to think of various ways that I could "get happy". Let me assure you, my suspicious friends, that there are absolutely no libations involved with "getting happy"! I know you are sighing with relief.  The truth is that I have a theme for the year. It's based on a biblical principle found in Philippians 4:11 ". . .for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am". I have learned that there are going to be many things in this life that I will be asked to do for Christ. Many of them I will enjoy. Some of them I will not understand, and some of them I will simply NOT want to do. But obeying is not an option. I'm going to obey not matter what (at least that's the goal) so in the words of my pastor and friend, Mark Dutton, I might as well just get happy about it. How true that is.  So, this is the beginning for a lot of things in my life. It's going to be a bumpy ride, but I'm already getting happy about it!   "But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him." ~Philippians 3:7-9a
