      Today was the last day and the shortest. We had only one session that lasted between 10:00 AM and lunch. We started by working on the tor-yus again. After working on the tor-yus, we did two sets back to back. We then had a tea break.  After the break we had Joan and Lee show us how their tor-yus had improved. Both were up front for several minutes demonstrating what they had learnt. We took a group photo and Lee presented Joe with a red envelope on behalf of the students. Joe said that he will give the contents of the envelope to the Feed The Homeless charity on D'Arcy Street in Toronto.  We ended with another great meal prepared by Virginia Amos. She sure can cook. The food alone was a reason to be here.

      We started by doing some dan-yus, a set, more dan-yus and another set. Just in case we did another set. We then took a very deserved tea break.  After chilling and talking for a while it was time for more work. Like yesterday we worked on the tor-yu. It was smoother than yesterday but my tor-yu will be awkward for weeks after this. When we finished, it was time to set up for lunch.   Lunch Break   Dee lead us in another chair set. Never thought sitting could be so much work. Then Karen lead us in some chanting. We did a new chant we hadn't done yesterday sitting on the chairs we used for the set. Then we repeated one of the chants from yesterday. Forgive me but I forget the names, they don't roll right off your tongue. Now we are on an extended tea break.  After the break we practiced push hands for some time trying to incorporate the new tor-yu into the push hands. Joe talked about letting the bones do the work and not muscling through. We finished by doing a set.   Dinner Break   We started with a set, of course. We then worked on two moves, Slanting Flying and Pat Horse. Slanting Flying was pretty much what I am used to. The Pat Horse incorporated the tor-yu we have been working on. We ended with a sitting meditation led by Mary Lou. Afterwards some of us went to a coffee shop to relax and socialize.

      I am in Tallahassee for the Memorial Day Tai Chi Workshop, I flew in on Friday. Randy who had been planning to visit his daughter in North Carolina, changed his plans (his daughter had to work over the weekend), and came here instead.  It has been a busy day. We started a little after 10:00 AM. We did a couple of sets and then Joe started us working on tor-yus. We worked on through till lunch at 1:00 PM. The lunch fare was great, prepared by Virginia Amos, and after a nice workout it hit the spot just right.   Lunch Break   We did another set and then chanted for twenty minutes or so. We looked at various ways of doing snakes (and you though there was only one way, hah!). Joe, the instructor showed us a way of sitting that helps you stretch your legs and make them more flexible. By then it was time to practice more tor-yus. By 6:00 PM it was dinner time and we set up the tables for dinner. Dinner was just as good as lunch if not better.   Dinner Break   One of the members who is a musician, brought out a lute, a 24 string instrument. He played several pieces for us until it was time to work again.  A little after 8:00 or 9:00 PM we did a set. Mary Lou then taught us some sitting Taoist meditation. To end the night the students who attended the sword workshop demoed the sword set.  As hard as I have worked, we have been given plenty of breaks and you can stop anytime you feel tired. Just when you start thinking that you cannot take anymore, its time for a break, or even better a great meal.

He taught Go Back to Ward Off Monkey, Slanting Flying and Step Up and Raise Hands.   Continuing Class  We warmed up with the jongs and we started to work on Wave Hands Like Clouds right away. After a few rows of that, Randy had us do a set. We practiced more Wave Hands after the set.

       Beginners Class  Randy reviewed the brush knee sequence. Today he covered the moves up to the first Cross Hands. The class ended by reviewing the following sequence several times: Brush Knee, Strum the Pei Pa, Brush Knee and Twist Step, Brush Knee and Twist Step, Brush Knee, Strum the Pei Pa, Brush Knee and Twist Step, Chop With Fist, Step up, Deflect, Parry, Punch, Appear to Close Entrance, Cross Hands   Continuing Class  We warmed up and we did a set. After the set we did twenty dan-yus and then we worked on Wave Hands Like Clouds for the remainder of the class. Aside from stressing the gradual stand and sit, Randy talked about the weight transfer. He talked about the right leg pushing until it was time to stand and pull the leg over. I found that aside from pushing and sitting, I had to make sure I was balanced on the left leg, otherwise I end up a bit off balance when I pick up the right leg. I also found that the left arm helps me balance while transferring my weight.

      Some of you may remember our monthly dinners. Our tradition is to get together the first Wednesday of the month at a local restaurant after class. Recently we had been meeting on Mondays. We had been going to the Thai restaurant on the circle, but we would like to find a good Chinese restaurant in the vicinity instead. Looking for Chinese restaurants nearby, I came up with the following list:     Canton Jade Chinese Restaurant  3824 W 12th Ave Hialeah, FL 33012 (305) 557-2673    China-Town Chinese Food & Catering  5223 NW 79th Ave Doral, FL 33166 (305) 599-0488    Hoe Kow Chinese Restaurant  9717 NW 41st St Doral, FL 33178 (305) 591-0222    Kam Kee Chinese Restaurant  3640 Palm Ave Hialeah, FL 33012 (305) 825-1300    Nine Dragons Chinese Restaurant  930 E 9th St Hialeah, FL 33010 (305) 885-6376   This is where you come in, I have no idea if any of these restaurants are any good. If you have dined at any of these places or if you know of another place not on this list, add a comment to this post and let us know what you think.  I am also looking for your thoughts on what night to have dinner. The first Monday of the month is particularly bad for Randy because he teaches a Tuesday morning (6:30 a.m.) tai chi class in South Miami and we have branch council meetings that night at 8:30 p.m.. Wednesdays are better for Randy but he has a class on Thursday mornings too (yes, at 6:30 a.m. again). The first Monday and Tuesday of the month are bad, Wednesdays are not that good either. That leaves the other Mondays and Tuesdays of the month (2nd, 3rd & 4th) and Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. I'd like to figure out what is the best night for the whole group. Again, make with the comments.  Making comments to a post is not hard at all. Below each post you will see the author of the post and the time. After those you should see the number of comments for that post (for example:  posted by Alex at 09:55  |   0 comments  ). Click on that comment link to add a comment. If you don't have a free account with Blogger, it will ask you to create one. Create you account and comment away, voila! If you have trouble adding a comment or creating an account with Blogger, send me an email and I'll see if I can help you.

       Not to be left out, the Texas branch has their own Year of the Monkey t-shirt. The shirt is red (a lucky color in China) has a Chinese papercut of a monkey sitting on a branch in metallic gold. The shirt costs $15.00 and all orders have to be sent in by the 20th of May. I will post the picture of the shirt at the center and we will have the order form by tonight. Please pay with a check, it makes it much easier to track who has paid.  We must have the payment before we can place the order.

      So far, I have been the only one posting. This is understandable, since the blog is under a week old. I have sent out invitations to those who have expressed interest in posting. If you are at all interested, send me a note or talk to me in class, I'll be happy to help you out. Posting a comment is extremely easy. If you can send an email without hurting yourself or others in the process, you can post a message on our blog.  I want this blog to be a place where we can find out what is happening but I want it to be an online meeting place too. Somewhere where you can come and interact with your friends. If you have a question or a comment or news you would like to share with the group, post it here for all to see. If you have a question about a previous post or you wonder what happened to someone from class, by all means, post! This is not a formal place with a lot of rules, on the contrary, we are making this up as we go along. And if you should decide that a post you made needs some work or should vanish into thin air, you can edit it to your heart's content or even discard the entire post as if it had never existed.  All I am saying is that this is your blog as well as it is mine. I want you and need you to contribute. Reading the posts and keeping up on what is happening is great, nothing wrong with that. I just want to make sure that you know that your participation is encouraged and welcome. Don't be shy, this is not hard and you do not need special computer skills to make a post, anyone with access to the internet can make a post.  I hope to read posts from all of you very soon, even if it is to only say that you like it (if you don't like it you can tell me offline).

      May's instructors meeting was chaired by Mike Huffaker. We talked about a Sarasota workshop that was attended by Mike and Tsyr Han. Mike demonstrated some of the things he was taught by Sean at the workshop. Gwen Wood showed us how transaction sheets are supposed to be filled out. She also showed us how she processes the transaction sheets so they are ready to be deposited. Gwen also told us that many members have responded to our financial difficulties and the donations for April were over seven thousand dollars. We talked about the scheduling of beginner and continuing classes.  The next Instructors meeting will take place in July. Details will follow.

      In response to a request from the society I have transferred ownership of the taoistaichi.com domain to them. The society had decided last year that they didn't want us to use commercial level domains (.com) only non-profit domains (.org).  This was entirely voluntary on my part, I owned the domain until the registration expired in a year or two and I didn't have to turn it over if I chose not to. I understood their point of view, even if I didn't entirely agree, and I decided to comply.  The society has provided us with space on their server and Dick Goodman is now maintaining the pages for the Miami branch. You can check out  urlLink our pages  on the society's  urlLink web site .  I figured since we no longer had our own personal space that a blog would serve us well. This is a much more interactive way to communicate with the members and it is much easier to manage. To be able to make posts, I have to add your name to the list. All I have to do is send you an email invitation. All you need to do is, click on the link in the email, create and account with blogger (no fear, it's free) and start posting. Everyone can read the blog, even if you don't have an account. The link to our blog is:  urlLink http://miamispringstaichi.blogspot.com/ .  Let me know if you want to join. You will need to give me your email account. Remember you only need an account to make new entries, every one can read the blog and its all free.

       Beginners Class   Randy reviewed the moves from Monday, Commencement of Tai Chi and Left Grasp Bird's Tail. He taught three new moves, Grasp Bird's Tail, Single Whip and Step Up and Raise Hands.   Continuing Class   Randy had us practice Go Back to Ward Off Monkey for the duration of the class. It was a repulse monkey intensive.   Ongoing Beginners Class   We only had four people show up for class. Since there were so few people we practiced the moves from the first class instead of working on new moves.

       Beginners Class  Randy reviewed Horizontal Single Whip, Parting Wild Horse's Mane, Left Grasp Bird's Tail, Step Up to Grasp Bird's Tail & Single Whip. He then taught Fair Lady Works Shuttles, Left Grasp Bird's Tail, Step Up to Grasp Bird's Tail, Single Whip, Wave Hands like Clouds & Single Whip. Most of the class was spent on Fair Lady Works Shuttles as the rest of the moves were not new.   Continuing Class  We warmed up with the jongs, tor-yus and only ten dan-yus. We then worked on Turn and Chop with Fist and Step up, Deflect, Parry, Punch. Randy showed us that there were several stands in this two moves. He asked us to make sure that we did each one.

       Beginners Class  Randy reviewed Kick With Right Foot, Strike Ears with Fists, Kick With Left Foot & Turn and Kick. He then taught Step up, Deflect, Parry, Punch, Appear to Close Entrance, Cross Hands, Carry Tiger to Mountain, Horizontal Single Whip, Parting Wild Horse’s Mane, Left Grasp Bird’s Tail, Step Up to Grasp Bird’s Tail & Single Whip. Since many of the moves were repeats, he reviewed those moves quickly and moved on.   Continuing Class  We warmed up with the jongs, tor-yus and forty nine dan-yus. After a water break we did a set. Amazingly we all managed to make it through the set without fainting.

      The weekend was pretty busy what with a tai chi intensive on Saturday and a lok hup intensive on Sunday. As usual, Virginia was a great instructor. On Saturday she reviewed several moves and helped us refine them. We also worked quite a bit on tor-yus and dan-yus.  Sunday was pretty similar, except that my lok-hup is a bit rusty. It was nice to get to work on lok-hup with a group of people who know more than you do. I now have a lot more work to do, but at least I have a better clue.  I am glad to report that we had a very nice turn out from Miami Springs on Saturday. Aside from Randy and me, we had Ellen, Jeanmarie and Gail. Even though Virginia worked us pretty hard, harder than usual in my "intensive" experience, we all survived.  I would like to know what Ellen, Jeanmarie and Gail thought of the intensive. Perhaps they will decide to share their thoughts with the rest of the group ( hint, hint ).

      Virginia must love Miami because she is staying the whole weekend, lucky for us. Perhaps someone will talk her into cooking while she's here. While convincing her to cook for us might be difficult, someone has managed to talk her into leading a Lok Hup intensive for us. The intensive will take place on Sunday, June 27th from 1:00 to 4:00 pm in South Miami.  The suggested donation for this event is $20.00.   The South Miami center is located in the Yoham building at 6301 Sunset Drive, Suite 204, South Miami.  See you there!

      No matter if you have been practicing tai chi for three months, one year or ten, you can benefit from attending an intensive. I have attended many intensives as well as workshops and I would recommend that everybody attend both if they have the opportunity. You should not feel intimidated about the amount of exercise or how good your tai chi may be. The term intensive refers to getting a lot of instruction in a short time not the amount of exertion involved. If you are lucky you will get a correction or two and that is what you want to happen at an intensive or workshop. Getting a correction early may save you many years of doing a move incorrectly and may help you improve your practice. Don't feel intimidated, no one will think less of you because you make a mistake, we all mess up. Actually the way I have come to think about it is that if I haven't messed up, I am not working hard enough.  I hope these words encourage you to attend. I expect to see you at the next intensive and/or workshop!

      I just found out that the Dalai Lama is coming to Miami in September. You can get more information about the schedule of the high Lama's visit and how to get tickets on the  urlLink Dalai Lama Miami  site. Who imagined that the Dalai Lama had a web site? Actually he has two I guess, the University of Miami which is sponsoring part of his holiness' visit also has  urlLink a site for the Dalai Lama . I guess that aside from being enlightened, the high Lama is also pretty web savvy. Who knew?

        The following letter was written by Paul Crowe, a member and instructor of the Taoist Tai Chi Society. Paul wrote this letter in response to questions of why we do not play music in our classes. In addition to experience coming from over 20 years of practice in our arts Paul has also completed 2 Masters Degrees dedicated to the study of the Taoist Tradition and Taoist practices for self-cultivation. Paul is currently completing a PhD also on the same subject and is teaching courses on Chinese thought and culture at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University. The Regional Management Committee, Regional Instruction Committee and, of course, Paul hope this letter provides insights into the logic and meaning behind some of the Society's guidelines.   As students and instructors of Taoist Tai Chi we have inherited something much more than a beautiful form of slow motion exercise. Master Moy Lin Shin, through his efforts and insights, gave us a very rare gift, crafted through centuries of trial and error by leaders of one of the world's rich spiritual traditions. In this, the first generation after his death, the responsibility falls upon each of us to preserve and develop this gift. One of the challenges we face is embracing change and evolution, both of which have been constants in the history of Taoism, without compromising the core spirit and integrity of the tradition. This requires wisdom, intelligence, and flexibility (a sign of strength in Taoism).  Over the years before and following Master Moy's death, a perennial difficulty has surfaced. The basic and simple approach to instructing Taoist Tai Chi has been augmented in a variety of ways. Some examples would be introducing basic "Qigong" (Ch'i-kung) exercises, breathing exercises before or after class, playing music while practicing the set, or practicing techniques from other Tai Chi schools and styles.  There are times when these practices reflect an attitude of flagrant disrespect for the founder and the tradition of cultivation he transmitted to us. These cases are easy to deal with, as the problem and the solution are readily understood. In many cases though, these additions to the standard class format are well-intentioned, arising out of a sincere desire to improve the experience for the students but stemming from a genuine misunderstanding about the nature of what we are practicing.  This misunderstanding is not surprising when we consider that for many of us our most basic ideas concerning who we are and how we fit into the world are rooted in European cultural assumptions. These assumptions include a belief that somehow the collection of functions subsumed under the vague and mysterious term 'mind' are fundamentally separate from the body. This implies that exercising the body is quite separate from cultivation of mind and or spirit. This assumption is not present in Taoist traditions where exercise exists on a continuum of cultivation of the whole person. Failure to recognize this very basic cultural divergence can lead to viewing Tai Chi as little more than a tool for achieving "physical fitness." This, in turn, affects our expectations as students and instructors.  There are very few instructors who have not occasionally felt that what they are teaching might not be stimulating enough for students and wonder: Is there too much repetition? Are these students tired of the same exercises class after class? We begin to wonder what more we can offer to sustain interest and enthusiasm. These questions reflect an active interest in the students, which is a valuable thing, but they also reveal a lack of confidence in the simple methods Master Moy employed and this lack of confidence is often rooted in a misapprehension about why his methods were so simple.  Mr. Moy grounded the simplicity of his approach in the belief that the Tai Chi he taught was a foundation for meditation and indeed was a form of meditation in and of itself. His goal was not to amuse, excite, or entertain us. He aimed to teach us how to still our hearts while we were in motion and, for those who chose to practice, while in the stillness of seated or standing meditation.  Much of modern life revolves around distracting ourselves and filling our senses. Televisions and radios hum in the background at work or at home. Our journeys through the city are littered with noise and advertisements. Desirable products beckon to us from shop windows. Less and less do we experience silence, solitude, and empty time for reflection. Taoist priest Mui Ming-do, co-founder of Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism, explained once that it is much more difficult for us in modern times with hectic, demanding lives and a myriad distractions to cultivate the Tao.  Master Moy spent his life trying to pass on a method of training that would give us the resolve and inner discipline to create spaces of silence and stillness for ourselves. The ability to be silent and still makes it possible for us to deepen our meditation but it is also a vitally important ability if we are to understand and apply the principles of Tai Chi to our bodies. The body is infinitely subtle and complex and to apply the movements of the form in a way that can affect our health we must reclaim our ability to listen to and observe our body's inner state in addition to matters of timing and balance. Master Moy's form of Tai Chi is perhaps not the most beautiful or elegant style but that is a reflection of his belief that what matters is on the inside. To gain access to the inside we need silence and stillness.  As our internal stillness deepens our practice becomes rich and deeply rewarding. Out of that meditative practice comes a desire to share what we have experienced with others and with time the confidence to accept that it is the very simplicity of the external form and teaching that unlocks many of the health benefits and the profundity of the inner experience. Conveying the external form of the movements is already a great challenge but the real challenge lies in finding a way to show students how they can re-establish a connection with their own bodies. To do this we have to put aside concerns that they need more information, more techniques, more amusements, and accept that fundamentally Mr. Moy was teaching us how to be simple, still, and quiet.       The illuminating mind is constantly still.  If it moves then it responds to the myriad transformations.  Although it moves, its basic substance is constant stillness.  The misleading mind is constantly moving.  If it is still then a myriad thoughts arise.  Although still, its fundamental substance is constant movement.    " Diagram of Illuminating and Misleading " attributed to Taoist teacher Li Daochun (fl. ca. 1288) and translated by Paul Crowe.

      Wednesday night after class we met at a new restaurant, Suvi Thai & Sushi. We had been meeting at Thai Rama in the circle, but  because of some conflicts we hadn't managed to make it in the past few months. Savi is a brand new place and it is located where the old JD's Pizza used to be. The actual address is 5683 NW 36th Street. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The decor of the restaurant is very attractive. We will definitely be coming back next month. We plan to meet the second wednesday of every month after class. See you there!

      This is my second trip to Tallahassee for a workshop. Both experiences were similar. I worked hard and improved my tai chi and I have much more work and improvements for the future. I met many people who share my interest in tai chi and I found everyone to be most agreeable. It may sound strange, but I have yet to meet an unpleasant person at a tai chi workshop.  The Tallahassee center is relatively new, it was inaugurated about two years ago. The facilities are very nice and comfortable. There is a spacious practice floor which doubles as a dinner hall, a well used kitchen, the administrative office and the men's and women's dorms. The men's dorm is located downstairs and consists of four comfortable futons. There is room for one or two more people to lay out on sleeping bags or cots. There are two bathrooms with showers, a computer that you can use to check your e-mail and a tv with a VCR and a DVD ( Note:  For those of you with wireless laptops, the network is 802.11G if you have A or B you will not be able to hook up, but if you are lucky enough to have G you can surf the web from your own laptop). The women's dorm is upstairs and has several bunks. I don't know exactly how many as I was not allowed upstairs. Men are only invited when the ladies need something heavy carried upstairs or when something needs fixing. I know that there are many more beds for the women as there are for men. If you look around you, you will see that there are many more women practicing tai chi than men, further proof that women are the smarter sex. Therefore they get more beds. Both times I have been there, Virginia Amos has cooked our meals and what meals they were! The food was both tasty and plentiful. This year there were not enough vegetarians to warrant a special vegan table but there was enough variety to please most if not all attendees.  The most remarkable thing about a workshop is not the level of the tai chi or the food or the facilities. What is most remarkable to me is how everyone works together. The attendees themselves set up the tables for lunch and dinner, which includes bringing out the tables and chairs as well as setting up the place settings and bringing out the food from the kitchen. After the meal everyone pitches in with picking up and cleaning. No one is forced to do anything they don't want and everyone is happy to do what they can. Maybe I lead a sheltered life, but I have hardly ever met such a group of happy, uncomplaining people. I am making plans to attend the Veteran's Day Workshop which promises to be just as good or better than this one. If you are considering attending one of these workshops but you wonder if it is worth the trouble, let me assure you it most definitely is worth it.

       Beginners Class  We started class by doing a set. Then we took requests for moves to review. First we worked on Kick With Right Foot and Strike Ears with Fists. After that we worked on Reach Up to Pat Horse, & Cross Hand to Penetrate. We ended the class by working on the Fair Lady Works Shuttles sequence. That marked the end of the beginner's class. The next Beginners class will begin on Monday, September 13th.   Continuing Class  We started with a warm up of the usual jongs. We followed the jongs with some tor-yus and dan-yus, we then did a set. After a quick break, we worked on Needle at Sea Bottom again.

       by Norine Dworkin   Sean Dennison executive director of the Taoist Tai Chi Society in Tallahassee, Fla., has been keeping fit with tai chi for 25 years.  "Tai chi is amazing," he says. During a 15 - 20 minute session of its continuously flowing movement, you will:    Boost your heart rate to moderately aerobic levels.   Promote circulation to all extremities.   Positively affect your autonomic nervous system and blood pressure.   Free up the diaphragm, for more efficient oxygen intake.     Why Tai Chi?   How can tai chi make a difference in your life? Check the research:    Cardiorespiratory fitness. Surprisingly, studies have found that tai chi may have a greater effect in this area than aerobics.    Muscle strength. Regular tai chi practice can boost it by 15 - 20%.   Bone strength. Regular tai chi practice may help ward off osteoporosis.   Better balance. A study at Emory University School of Medicine found that tai chi reduced falls among the elderly by almost 50%.   Blood pressure. A Johns Hopkins study found tai chi lowers it almost as much as aerobic exercise.   Rheumatoid arthritis. A University of Florida study discovered that tai chi improved the range of motion for sufferers of the condition.   Various conditions. Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, stroke, heart disease and emphysema have been shown to respond positively to tai chi.     Follow the Experts   Ready to try tai chi? Put on some loose, comfy clothes and sneakers, and follow these tips.    Study with a teacher. Books and videos can show you the basics, but a live, knowledgeable teacher who conveys the movements correctly, then adjusts your form along the way, is the key to unlocking tai chi's health and fitness benefits.  "Movement is guided by intention, and intention is guided by the eyes," says Dennison. "Where you look is crucial - it's part of the movement, the focus. You can't achieve this if you're staring at a video or a book."   Make a commitment. "There's a sequence to tai chi movements that must be learned in a specific order," Dennison explains. "Taoist tai chi has 108 movements, which take 15 - 20 minutes to perform. In the first two weeks, you might learn four or five movements, which take a minute to perform. Until you have a significant sequence of movements, you won't see as many benefits."   Be patient. "People often feel frustrated when they can't remember the sequence of movements," says Dennison. "Practice and repetition will fix those things."   Stay focused. "Tai chi works with the mind and the body," explains Edward Ware, a tai chi instructor at Crunch Fitness in New York. "Over time, you can more fully comprehend these connections if you practice in a way that promotes this awareness." The bottom line: Banish outside thoughts when you practice tai chi - focus on you.   Enjoy it! "Tai chi is about process, not result," says Ware. "There's no need to rush to the end of the movement or feel like you have to keep with other students. Tai chi is an investment that grows over time, and pays dividends in all areas of your life."   Norine Dworkin is a freelance health and fitness writer in New York. She's written for Good Housekeeping, Food & Wine and Natural Health.

       Beginners Class  Randy reviewed the moves from Wednesday. We reviewed Creeping Low like a Snake, Step Up to Seven Stars, Retreat to Ride Tiger, Turn Around to Sweep Lotus, Draw Bow to Shoot Tiger, Chop with Fist, Step up, Deflect, Parry, Punch, Appear to Close Entrance, Cross Hands & Closing of Tai Chi. We also reviewed Fair Lady Works Shuttles.   Continuing Class  We started right away with two sets back to back. After the sets we did a few tor-yus. Randy then had us work on our Needle to Sea Bottom move. Aside from coming back to center before going down, he reminded us to keep our weight on the back foot throughout the move and to turn down gradually starting at the neck.

Continuing Class  We had a bit of an abbreviated warmup doing only three jongs. We then did some tor-yus and some dan-yus. We then did a pretty slow set. We finished by doing some more dan-yus.

We then worked on Creeping Low like a Snake, Step Up to Seven Stars, Retreat to Ride Tiger & Turn Around to Sweep Lotus.   Continuing Class  Fresh from CIT week in Orangeville, Randy was in rare form. He had us work on the foundation exercises for half the class. Aside from doing a lot of warm-up, it seemed like the jongs would never end, we did quite a few tor-yus and dan-yus. We then did a set and had plenty of time left to do more tor-yus and dan-yus. By then, thankfully it was the end of class. Those of us who had the strength, crawled our way out.

       Beginners Class  Randy is still in Orangeville at CIT week. I reviewed Creep Low Like a Snake and Golden Cock Stands on One Leg. We quickly went over White Snake Turns and Puts Out Tongue (Tun and Chop with Fist), Step up, Deflect, Parry, Punch, Step Up to Grasp Bird’s Tail, Single Whip, Wave Hands like Clouds & Single Whip & Reach Up to Pat Horse. After a short break we worked on two new moves, Cross Hand to Penetrate & Turn and Kick. We also reviewed some more steps from the set that we already knew, Chop with Fist, Brush Knee and Punch, Step Up to Grasp Bird’s Tail & Single Whip.   Continuing Class  Just like Monday, we warmed up with the jongs, dan-yus and some tor-yus. After warming up we did a set. After a ten minute break, we did a second set.

       Beginners Class  Randy is in Orangeville at CIT week. I reviewed Fair Lady Works Shuttles, Left Grasp Bird’s Tail, Step Up to Grasp Bird’s Tail, Single Whip, Wave Hands like Clouds, Single Whip, Creeping Low Like a Snake, Golden Cock stands on One Leg, Go Back to Ward Off Monkey, Slanting Flying, Step Up and Raise Hands, White Stork Spreads Wings, Brush Knee, Needle at Sea Bottom & Fan Penetrates through the Back. We then worked on White Snake Turns and Puts Out Tongue, Step up, Deflect, Parry, Punch, Step Up to Grasp Bird’s Tail, Single Whip, Wave Hands like Clouds & Single Whip, Reach Up to Pat Horse.  Most of the moves we already knew, so we went through a lot of moves. Actually, White Snake Turns and Puts Out Tongue is the same move as Turn and Chop with Fist, so we were learning the sequence of moves and not new moves per se.   Continuing Class  We warmed up with the jongs, dan-yus and some tor-yus, then we did a set. After a break, we did a second set and by then it was time to go.

      Continuing Instructors Training will take place this year between July 10th and 14th at the International center in Orangeville, Canada. Randy is attending CIT Week, as he does every year, and I will be taking over the beginner class for the Monday and Wednesday that Randy will be out of town. We will have continuing class too, but I will just be leading the sets. I can only teach at a beggining level. It will be more of a practice than a regular class.

       Continuing Class  Randy had us warm up with jongs, tor-yus and dan-yus, then we did a set. After the set Randy had us do more tor-yus and a few more dan-yus. After a short break we spent the rest of the class working on Deflect, Parry and Punch.

       Continuing Class  Randy's daughter is in town, so he asked me to cover the class for him. Due to the bad weather, we only had four people show up. We warmed up with the jongs. I spent some time explaining how to do each one for the benefit of the graduates from the recently completed beginners class. Then we did some tor-yus. Again I spent a few minutes explaining the very basics of the tor-yu. Then we did some chair assisted dan-yus and snakes. I explained the basics of those as well. Being nice and warm, we did a slow set.  After a quick break we went over Deflect, Parry and Punch. The "beginner" students asked me to review the move and since we didn't have time for a second set, having spent so much time on the warm-up, I went ahead and reminded them how the move went. I showed them the move from the end of Punch Down and from the end of Fan Penetrated Through the Back. By the time we did the move a few times it was time to go.  Randy should be back in class by Wednesday night.
