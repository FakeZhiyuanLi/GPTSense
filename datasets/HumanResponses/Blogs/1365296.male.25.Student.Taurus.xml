      I admit it.  I watch  American Idol .  Not the entire show, mind you.  I watch the first few episodes that showcase the auditions for the show.  I can't watch the actual contest itself because listening to people sing the kind of stuff they have on the show pisses me off to no end.  I find it one of the most annoying things in this godforsaken world.  I want to kill people who sing out loud in front of people or sing to themselves or sing on talent shows like American Idol.  So why do I watch?  The morons that get up there and think they can sing.  Now there are those who actually think they can sing, but can't.  I rank it as one of those mysteries of the universe that will make your head implode like the Witch King if you think about it too long.  But some of the others that get up there I can't figure out.  Do they really think they can sing, or are they purposefully trying to make fools of themselves?  The world may never know.  The same thing with  Last Comic Standing .  I find this show the best of the talent reality shows.  But the audition process is amazing.  The people who audition for  American Idol  are trying to be goofy and funny.  Same thing with  Last Comic Standing .  Which begs the question, "Do they really think they are funny?"  Some of them are just acting like jackasses.  Then there are those who really think they are funny.  Its really sad because they are wasting their lives.  I know I'm funny, but only in small crowds of friends.  But this does not make me a stand-up comic.  And some of these people have said that they got into this due to winning talent shows.  NO!  This does not mean you are stand-up comic material.  Just because a small group of idiots who couldn't see talent if it walked in wearing a flashing neon sign, doesn't mean you are funny.  Ahh, the delusions of grandeur.

      I am bored.  I have done nothing today.  I did go out and turn in a job application, but that was it.  Now I find myself even more bored.  I've been sitting here flipping between  Joan of Arcadia  and  Star Trek: TNG .  Normally I would enjoy watching  Joan , but its not a particularly good episode.  Basically, wheelchair guy gets laid for the first time after his accident, detective dad has a breakdown, and Joan watches over troubled kids and teaches them the glories of the violence known as the pinata which pisses off the head girl in charge because it somehow reminds her of the beatings her dad gave her.  Oh the joys.   TNG  is equally unimpressive.  Its season two, so there's the main reason.  In a more detailed synopsis, Dr. Pulaski contracts a strange virus or antibody that makes her even older than she already is.  And it was all caused by the genetically engineered humans that are telepathic and can move objects with their minds.  If there's one thing everyone should know, seasons one and two were shitty.  Some episodes were okay, such as season one's "Conspiracy" and "The Neutral Zone".  Season two's only good episode is "Q Who", and that's only because it introduced the Borg.  I'm convinced that the suckiness known as seasons one and two are the result of Gene Roddenberry.  Why do i say this?  Well, they are similar to the original series.  There were some good episodes, but the rest were shit.  I mean, come on.  Roman gods occupying a planet?  That's just goofy.  "But its science fiction, man!"  Bullshit.  Its futuristic Greek mythology.  Its Dungeons & Dragons in space.  Oh well.  TNG got good come season three, so it all works out in the end.  The remaining five seasons redeem the show by ten fold, maybe more.  Now if only SpikeTV would start playing  DS9  in the right order.  Fucking bastards!

      Well, Ray Charles died.  My feelings on the matter remind me of an SNL skit with Will Farrell as Harry Carey talking about the death of Mother Teresa.  Just like Harry Carey wasn't a fan of Teresa's, I wasn't a particular fan of Charles.  Its sad that he's gone, and he certainly had an impact on music, but I don't find myself getting worked up over it.  Maybe I'm an asshole.  Actually, I'm sure of it.  But that's not the point of this post.  Ronald Reagan died earlier, which I did find very sad.  But, again, that's not the point.  My mom always tells me that famous people die in threes.  It always works that way.  And its odd because she's right.  Well, boys and girls, we have two down.  Who will be the magic number three?  I guess we'll just have to wait.

      Well, I'm sorry this has to be my first politically oriented piece.  This is really depressing.  But before I get started, I should qualify something.  I'm a moderate Republican.  I'm socially moderate to liberal, and fiscally/governmentally moderate to conservative.  I believe in a more pragmatic conservative agenda.  I am a Jeffersonian on one hand, who is suspect of government, a believer in local control, and someone who feels government is not the only answer.  But I am also fairly Lincolnian and Rooseveltian (Theodore) because I believe there are certain things the government must do or help do because the people can't do it all themselves.  Needless to say I've had my major disagreements with the Bush Administration.  I wasn't even an initial supporter.  I voted for Gore in 2000 (no clue why), and I supported Wesley Clark in the primary.  But in their infinite wisdom the Democrats nominated a hair-do: John Kerry.  The man is not much more than the disturbingly perfectly groomed hair on his freakishly marble chiseled head.  The man has to be everything to everyone, and because of this he fails so miserably.  If he'd just stand up for something and stop bitching and moaning and take a stand he'd be better off.  So would we.  Since my man Wesley Clark lost and John Kerry won, I've been in the Bush corner because I simply cannot vote for a guy who takes no stance.  But now I'm starting to question everything.  Its really hard because I joined the college Republicans at my school.  Big Bush supporters, they are.  Its also filled with conservatives, one or two religious right guys, and only one moderate that I know of.  Its really hard.  I'm being pulled in two different directions.  Oh well.  I'm a madman.  I'm like Mad Max, and the CR group is like Thunderdome.  Don't ask me who the retarded guy is.  Alrighty, now to the thing that has me really down and fairly angry.  Was reading one of my favorite bloggers,  urlLink Andrew Sullivan , and he linked to a  urlLink developing story  on the Bush's apparent approval of torture techniques against enemy combatants.  Basically it has to do with the al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo, but it has had far reaching consequences in Iraq.  Bush apparently approved it personally.  Granted, he didn't explicitly approve of torture against Iraqi prisoners.  But that's not the point.  What was he doing allowing torture against anyone at all?  I thought the US was better than that, but apparently I was wrong.  Actually, I'm not wrong.  The US is better than this, and the rest of the world knows it.  Its just that the Bush Administration isn't better than this.  I'm expecting the administration to move into hair splitting mode and justify the actions by claiming they were meant for "enemy combatants" and not POWs.  What's the difference?  Is one not accorded the basic human rights that we claim to love and cherish so much?  As a friend once said to me, if this is a War on Terrorism, why aren't the prisoners in Guantanamo listed as prisoners of war?  And if they aren't POWs, then is the War on Terrorism really a war?  I swear I heard the Bush Administration say the prisoners there were being treated according the Geneva Convention.  Well, it appears as though they might have lied.  Its sad because for a while I thought Bush was actually a good guy.  I disagreed with some of his actions and policies.  I don't believe the war in Iraq was an oil grab; I think there was a legitimate worry.  Saddam Hussein was a long-term threat at the most, and better to deal with him now than in the future against a rearmed Iraq.  But now I'm questioning most everything.  I'm not sure what to do.  I don't want to vote for John Kerry.  I think he's a dolt.  I don't think he will do anything of note.  I don't want to vote for the lesser of who cares.  Of course, I could always vote LaRouche...

      For some unholy reason I'm watching  The Simple Life  right now.  These girls are such whores.  Of course, I'm revealing to all two people who read this information they did not know before.  I feel bad for the Arkansas town that had to put up with these two glorified banshees.  Paris and Nicole have set a bad example.  Now all those people think all spoiled rich brats are like that...  Oh wait.  They are like that.  My mistake.

      The man in the shadows.  Its the scene where we have to two rivals sitting in a room.  Its an informal meeting with both discussing their positions and trading subtle threats.  But just beyond the reach of the firelight, in the dark shadows of the corner sits the silent man that neither acknowledges.  One sees the man as an ally, the other as a threat.  He sits silently, listening to both positions as if scouting his opposition.  When he does speak both men listen intently.  But he remains in the shadows, even when both acknowledge his presence in either a welcoming or hostile tone.  Such is the life of Ralph Nader.  His stature has significantly decreased since 2000, but neither party is either willing or able to see it.  The 2000 election was his shining moment.  But the man failed in his goals and made enemies along the way.  It is for this reason that he will do poorly in 2004.  So why is he seen as the potential spoiler?  The high expectations for Nader is boggling to the mind.  No third party candidate has ever done as well the second time around.  Few major third party candidates have ever run twice.  Perot was an exception, as is Nader.  But look at Perot as an example.  In 1992 he received nineteen per cent of the popular vote, arguably costing Bush 41 the election.  Then in 1996, with much the same concern on the Republican side as the Democrats are showing towards Nader this year, Perot comes in with only nine per cent of the popular vote and having no affect on an election in which Clinton was reelected in a landslide.  So why don't the Democrats feel that Nader will experience the same drop as Perot?  The more interesting question is why do the Republicans feel Nader will be just as "popular" as he was in 2000?  The mind boggle.  They are expecting way too much, and they will discover their error the hard way.  This has been an issue I've thought about for some time, but its been a while since I really gave it much thought.  It wasn't until yesterday that I began thinking about Nader and his candidacy again.  It started with a call from the incoming chairman of the University of Oregon College Republicans.  Apparently Nader is holding a signature gathering party next Saturday to collect enough signatures to get on the Oregon ballot, something at which he failed only a few months earlier.  Turns out the chairman was informing the various CR members in an attempt to get as many of us to attend the party as possible.  The idea is to help Nader get on the ballot so he can potentially hurt Kerry.  Needless to say I think its worthless to do such a thing since Nader won't have an impact on the election.  But apparently the Republican party doesn't believe so and is backing the operation from what I could gather.  The chairman told me not to mention to anyone that the Republicans are involved, so I can only assume they are organizing it or encouraging their members to help Nader in his effort (not sure whether its the state party or the national that's involved).  I find it a bit shady and sleazy.  One should work for the candidate they support and for no one else.  They should help their candidate win votes.  If a candidate can't win an election on his own and is dependent, no matter how small, on another candidate's potential to syphon votes away from the competition then maybe the candidate doesn't deserve to win.  Maybe the candidate doesn't deserve my vote.  I refuse to take part in such misadventures.  The Republicans are overestimating Nader's influence.  I'm also convinced that their actions will end up hurting them in the end.  But more than that, it will do them no good.  Nader will not be a factor.  Their efforts, which could have been applied towards furthering President Bush's reelection, will have gone to waste.  These efforts may end up hurting the campaign in the most drastic way possible, which would be the defeat of the President.  But I can hardly say I care.

      Today I saw the trailer for the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD.  Not much there really; just a bunch of scenes from all three movies spliced together.  Despite the lackluster trailer, however, I'm so excited about this trilogy.  Its about time it was released on DVD.  One can only hope that it took so long because Lucas wanted to make sure he could unleash the movies in their best quality.  Needless to say, Star Wars was made for DVD.  Its one of those movies that you simply can't slap onto a disk and distribute.  It needs to be applied to the DVD format with care.  It appears as though Lucas has taken extra special care, and this is a good thing.  I can't wait.

      Well, Iraqi terrorists have captured a South Korean man and are threatening to behead him.  What do they want?  South Korea's withdrawal from the US-led coalition.  Let's hope the South Koreans have more guts and sense than the idiotic Spanish.  The worst thing that could happen is for South Korea to hand another victory to the terrorists.  I can only hope and pray the Korean those bastards are holding somehow makes it out alive, but the chances are slim.  These people don't negotiate despite what they say.  I wouldn't be surprised if they killed the man anyways even if South Korea decides to leave the coalition.  These are the kinds of people (I use the term loosely) they are.  They don't care.  Its simply an excuse.  I may have my disagreements with the war and how it was handled, but its situations like this that convince me that the fight must go on.

      While reading the book  The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852-1856  by William E. Gienapp, I came to an interesting conclusion.  If Kerry wins the presidential election it will be by a very narrow margin.  If Bush wins, it will be by a landslide.  This deserves qualification.  It all started when I began reading the first chapter of the above mentioned book.  It was detailing the 1852 presidential election between Whig candidate General Winfield Scott and Democratic candidate Franklin Pierce.  Essentially, the Whigs believed Scott had wide appeal.  Despite the resistance of the Free Soil Party and the nomination of their own candidate, as well as the defection of northern Whigs who were against the Compromise of 1850, the Whig leaders believed Scott was popular and would prove to be a significant challenger to Pierce.  Is this not the way the Democrats view Kerry?  Despite the defection of such Democrats as Senator Zell Miller, they continue to believe in Kerry's popularity and potential.  He is seen as a tough challenge for President Bush.  Despite this thought, however, the Whigs were well aware of the potential problems the defections could have.  In response they abandoned past nativist sentiments and attempted to appeal to Catholics and immigrants, especially the Irish and Germans.  This alienated many in the nativist wing.  Beyond this, however, was the fact that these groups the Whigs were pandering to were essentially Democrats.  They had voted Democratic in the past and were viewed by the Democratic Party as a solid bloc.  The Whig pandering concerned the Democrats, but not enough to actively do much to counter it.  I can see the same situation developing with the Kerry campaign.  We have a third party candidate that is a threat tot he Democrats, Ralph Nader.  According to all the polls, Nader commands a significant percentage of the vote.  Granted the election is still many months off, but his polling numbers are scaring the Democrats.  This is pushing Kerry not only to compete with Nader, but also to appeal to the moderate Republican element that has shown some concern about Bush.  The real question is whether this tactic will pay off.  In the end it failed for the Whigs, leading to the disaster that befell Scott.  While there are moderate Republicans who dislike Bush, only a small portion are truly vocal about their dislike (myself included).  Some are deadset against Bush and plan on voting for Kerry, but many (again, myself included) don't know who they will vote for.  Essentially Kerry and his people are attempting to pander to the vocal minority, assuming it represents the majority.  I'm not convinced.  I don't believe the majority of moderate Republicans are going to vote against Bush.  At the most they will be about evenly split between Kerry and President Bush.  This will not be enough to get Kerry elected.  Then there's the anti-Bush element that many Democrats insist is large.  I have seen nothing to support this.  It certainly appears that way when one watches the news.  They show protests of every kind, and there has been story after story about Michael Moore and his new "documentary".  But the Bush hatred is not there.  It remains contained in the far left.  Moderate Republicans don't feel any hatred towards President Bush even though they do disagree with many of his positions.  Even centrist Democrats don't feel the hatred despite wanting someone else to hold the office.  The only people who feel such hatred are the wild-eyed leftists who hate everyone who isn't them.  These are people who would be complaining and moaning regardless.  These are people who hate Republicans as a general rule.  They are professional protesters who's idea of a good time is walking down the street chanting, "Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho...."  Just like their mistake in believing a significant portion of moderate Republicans want President Bush out, the Democrats believe their anti-Bush allies represent a significant voting bloc.  The truth is that many in the anti-Bush crowd don't vote.  Either that or they vote third party.  For the Democrats to expect so much from this crowd is folly, and they may pay for their folly.  So how does it all break down?  If Kerry wins the election, not only will the electoral vote be very close but so will the popular vote.  If President Bush is reelected, it will be by a landslide in the electoral vote but fairly close in the popular vote.  When Scott lost to Pierce in 1852 he lost the electoral vote by a landslide, but lost the popular vote by only 200,000 votes.  But as we all know, in this country its all about the electoral vote.  No one pays much attention to the popular vote unless the loser of the electoral college has the most popular votes, such as in 2000.  Kerry is speeding towards disaster.  Everything is pointing to a disaster.  Unfortunately he's taking the Democratic Party with him.  But this is exactly what happens when your party has no leadership of any kind.  This is what the Whigs experienced in 1852, and it led to their demise.  It also led towards to formation of the Republican party, which proved victorious in congressional election only two years after its formation and would elect the greatest president this nation has ever known in 1860.

      The UN, in its infinite wisdom, has decided to take on the most dangerous threat the world has faced since the Cold War:  urlLink SPAM .  And people wonder why we have such a bad attitude towards the UN.  With all the problems in the world, including famine, oppression, genocide, and AIDS, the United Nations has chosen to combat something that harms no one, more or less.  Granted, a lot of SPAM is sheer, ruthless thievery.  But a good majority of it is nothing more than an annoyance.  The only people that are taken advantage of and fall prey to thieves and scams are morons who have ignored every warning against responding to malicious emails.  SPAM is annoying, but it hardly merits a full scale UN investigation by one of its agencies.  The goal is to lobby world governments to pass standardized legislation that will allow law enforcement agencies to crack down on spammers.  Great.  Good times.  But why is the UN doing this?  Why has the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency, decided this is a pressing issue?  Why is there such an agency to begin with?  There are more pressing problems in the world that need much more attention than they are being given, according to the UN.  AIDS is but one example, and is oft cited by the UN as the most pressing world problem, but there are plenty of others.  Money quote:   "Spam and anti-spam protection cost computer users some $25 billion last year, according to the United Nations."   Just great.  Instead of costing computer users $25 billion, most of which can be reclaimed by them if the proper channels are used, it will cost the UN $25 billion.  This is money that could be better spent to help relieve the AIDS crisis in Africa.  But alas, it appears as though the UN crying about lack of funds to combat such catastrophic problems is nothing but words.  Unlike many of my Republican friends, I do not see the UN as a worthless organization that is defunct and should fade away just as the League of Nations once did.  Nor do I agree with my Democrat friends who believe the UN should be consulted at all costs and consulted with and revered.  The UN is a very important body that can do a lot of good around the world.  Indeed, it has done a lot of good and continues to do so.  But the UN is also a massive bureaucracy.  It is filled with some of the most corrupt individuals in the world.  This is something that all governments face, but some actually combat it.  The UN probably does as well, but it also puts on a good show of combating the problem.  Many individuals in the UN are friends and have worked together for many years, so its only logical that they would stick up for each other.  Under these circumstances such corruption should be expected.  The most damaging case of corruption the UN has faced is the still unfolding Oil for Food scandal.  It turns out that the Oil for Food program was filled to the brim with corruption of every kind.  Saddam bribed UN officials involved in running the program, and Saddam himself was allowed to run the program without UN oversight.  Its no wonder so many Iraqis starved and died during the twelve years of sanctions.  Saddam circumvented sanctions through the program, allowing him to stockpile cash he would use to increase his own wealth and opulence, as well as buy food and medicine that went directly to the government and the Republican Guard instead of to those who needed it.  Color me surprised.  But who was blamed during those twelve years?  The United States, despite trying to close the loopholes and end the corruption.  But other nations, such as France and Germany, actively worked against our efforts.  Now they are viewed as the most righteous nations because they opposed the Iraq War.  There's a reason why they didn't want the war: they were afraid that it would reveal the truth about their dealings with Iraq.  Its becoming apparent that France and other nations may have had something to do with the Oil for Food scandal.  It is the UN, however, that must take the blame.  They should be combating such manipulation of their organization.  Hopefully this scandal will result in a massive push for meaningful reform within the body.  Reform is something that is much needed.  The bureaucracy needs to be thinning, money needs to be directed towards those areas that need it.  The body's activities need to be properly focused.  The body also needs to reflect the democratic nature it was formed to promote and support.  It needs to reflect the focus on human rights it was designed to further.  No more Sudans or Libyas in control of the human rights committees.  The UN needs to support those nations that are democratic, reward those nations that have taken steps towards democratization, and pressure those that show blatant contempt for democracy and human rights.  But until that happens, expect the UN to act against such global problems as SPAM while crying about the lack of help for other problems.  Its like a bad Austin Powers script with Dr. Evil threatening to take over the world using SPAM.  That is, unless, of course, they pay him a hefty ransom.

      The NAACP has recently lashed out against President Bush and publicly called for the removal of his "regime."  So what's new?  They've done this before.  They've done nothing but criticize President Bush and had nothing but horrible things to say about him.  This is why the President refused to speak at their convention this time around when they invited him.  I don't blame President Bush for refusing to speak at the convention.  I'd refuse to speak at it, as well.  They obviously hate him and he would be stepping into hostile territory.  But what's funny is that they had the gall to invite him in the first place.  Did they really think he'd accept?  Did they have something shady planned for his appearance?  What's funnier is that now they are pissed that he won't attend, and have now renewed their calls for the removal of his "regime."  These people are absolutely clueless.  Of course the NAACP has been an idiotic organization for some time now.  They used to do some great things and stand up for some great causes.  But now they have gone the way of Jesse Jackson and simply stand up to get publicity.  That and the NAACP has become a worthless bureaucracy.  They have done some good things recently, most notably their fight against the Confederate battle flag.  Mostly, however, they have done nothing but bitch and moan over nothing, making big issues out of nothing.  Now they're pissed at President Bush for refusing to address their convention?  Common sense only dictates that someone you've opposed vigorously will not address your convention when asked to.  Yet they're pissed.  They've never supported him, even after he reached out to them in the 2000 election, something that no Republican had ever done before.  They constantly, at every opportunity, spoken out against him.  Some of the NAACP's members have even called him a racist, which is not true in the slightest.  Therefore, anyone with the slightest bit of common sense would expect President Bush to be skeptical of any invitation forwarded by the group and in the end refuse that invitation.  But it would appear the NAACP lacks common sense.  Then again, because I have spoken out against the NAACP, I'm a racist and my opinions mean nothing.  The mind boggles.

      I have made a decision.  It took a long, hard think but I finally made my decision.  I am not voting for President Bush.  Part of the reason is his policy towards homosexuals.  He claims to be tolerant and mindful of equality for all, but it just doesn't jibe with the evidence.  The man has shown no tolerance towards homosexuals.  He has done this through simple inaction and a refusal to even acknowledge their existence.  He refuses to even mention the terms "gay," "lesbian," and "homosexual."  The President ignores them and treats them as though they don't exist.  How can you truly care about a person's rights and equality if you don't acknowledge them?  But this issue is only one of a larger problem that has arisen since the beginning of the Bush candidacy in 1999.  With President Bush's election came the ascension of the Religious Right.  The Religious Right has always been a part of the Republican Party ever since the late-1970s.  President Reagan's election helped establish them as a prominent wing within the party, although they were not one of the dominant wings.  The wing became dominant with the 1994 congressional elections and the retaking of Congress by the Republicans.  The rallying organization at the time was the Pat Robertson brainchild known as the Christian Coalition, then headed by Ralph Reed.  At the same time several leaders of the Religious Right published books, including   urlLink Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America   by Gary Bauer,   urlLink Steeling the Mind of America  (a collection of essays by prominent members of the religious right), and Ralph Reed's own book   urlLink Contract With the American Family: A Bold Plan  .  This was the high point of the Religious Right's influence.  They were  the  influence in the Republican Party and one could not even dream of being elected without their approval.  But the 1996 reelection of President Clinton saw the slow decline in the Religious Right's influence.  They hurled everything they had against President Clinton, the one person they saw as the leading example of America's moral decay, and they lost.  It was a big blow to them, but it would not prove to be the last.  The largest blow came in the disastrous results of the 1998 congressional elections, which saw a major shift against the Republicans in congress despite forecasts to the contrary.  This resulted in the resignation of the champion of the Republican cause, Newt Gingrich.  With this defeat the already weakened Religious Right shrunk back to the prominence it held when it first entered the political fray in the late-70s.  Despite their decline, they remained in the background.  They were still an influence in the party, but they successfully operated under the proverbial radar.  Many simply ignored them, considering the group defunct and out of the picture.  After much concern I even declared them gone.  We were all wrong.  They never seemed to play a large role in President Bush's campaign, but it has now become apparent that they were operating in the background there.  One should have expected this with President Bush's declared religious beliefs.  Now reports have surfaced of Bible studies being held in the White House on a regular basis, not to mention Attorney General Ashcroft's fundamentalist beliefs and the Bible studies that have accompanied him to the Justice Department.  Then there's the social conservatism that has permeated the Bush Presidency.  It is completely in line with the Religious Right's views.  The best example of this is not only Bush's silence concerning homosexuals and homosexual issues, but his endorsement of the Federal Marriage Amendment.  The Federal Marriage Amendment would codify, in the Constitution, that marriage shall only be between a man and a woman.  At least, that is what has been claimed by its advocates.  In actuality it is much more.  The FMA actually states, "Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any State or Federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."  Supposedly President Bush and other supporters of the FMA believe civil unions and other contracts are perfectly fine, and that only the institution of marriage should be reserved for men and women.  If this is so, however, then why outlaw "legal incidents thereof?"  The current language would make not only gay marriage illegal, but civil unions and all other contracts between homosexual couples as well.  This betrays the true beliefs of the FMA's supporters, as well as President Bush's.  Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas recently wrote in the   urlLink National Review Online  , "If the movement for civil unions and same-sex marriage succeeds, we may well be dealing a fatal blow to an already vulnerable institution."  They can claim no more that the only target is gay marriage, but all legal contracts that would give homosexual couples the rights heterosexual couples have.  The FMA has no chance of passing.  There are too many opponents.  But was it always the true intention of the Religious Right, its most ardent supporters, actually to pass such an amendment?  According to its most prominent members, no.  Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council recently said in a   urlLink New York Times   interview, "Social conservatives are looking at this issue so we know who needs to be educated on this issue or removed if that is possible."  The goal was never to win the vote, although that would have been an added bonus.  It was a measure used in the goal to remake the Republican Party into a fundamentalist Christian party.  It is designed to bring about the transformation of the party into something resembling the Constitution, American, and American Heritage parties.  Their conservatism is focused on the social aspect, one that would use the government to enact and enforce what they deem to be the morals of America.  These morals would, of course, be based on their brand of "Christianity."  This will destroy the party.  It will relegate it to third party status.  That is unless a resistance movement can be formed.  It is unclear whether this will be done since this is an election year and many Republicans fear that any deviance would cost them.  Many have already declared their resistance.  The rest can walk a fine line and use the Religious Right, then betray them after the elections.  But the Religious Right is still acting stealthily.  The upcoming Republican Convention is filled with moderates and liberals.  This has been designed by President Bush and his advisor Karl Rove to show the nation of the Republican Party's diversity and the broad support for President Bush.  The Religious Right has already expressed concern over the lack of representation, but this concern has been lukewarm at best.  I'm not unconvinced that this is some sort of ploy on their part; some sort of deception on their part designed to conceal their coming coup d'etat.  The only way of stopping their plans may be the defeat of President Bush.  Unfortunately I don't see that happening.  The worst thing that could happen is a Bush landslide, which is what I feel will happen.  If this is the result come November, it will be interesting to see what happens when the Religious Right declares victory and comes out into the open.  The lines are being drawn, and the resistance is forming.  The Republican Party has some great moderate voices, including Giuliani, Hagel, McCain, and Schwarzenegger.  I only hope that they take a stand and rally their supporters to fight the coming civil war within the party.  If they don't, then the party will be doomed.

      I've decided that I should dedicate a portion of this blog towards the discussion of movies and television, either specific or in general. So, without further delay, I shall start.  I went and saw M. Night Shyamalan's  The Village  this afternoon. I'll say straight away that I loved the film. I think it is his best film to date.  urlLink  The Sixth Sense   was a good film that I really enjoyed and had a nice twist that I wasn't expecting, but for me over time it loses a bit of its appeal. While I consider it to be a well-made film, I don't plan on buying it because I know it will go the way of  Jurassic Park  (i.e. it will sit and collect dust on my shelf after being watched only once). Never saw and don't have any desire to see  urlLink  Unbreakable  . I thought  urlLink  Signs   was a good film that spoke to the spiritual nature of us all, while at the same time speaking to the skeptic and those who have gone through crises of faith. It did its job, and did it well, and was a story of redemption on a certain level.   The Village  is totally different from the above films. It does have the type of suspense Shyamalan is known for, and while the film does have thriller moments, I would not label it an outright thriller. But the twist endings Shyamalan is best known for is oddly missing in this film. The movie does have a twist to it, but it exists mainly in the lives of the characters and their simple village. Unlike  The Sixth Sense , this film's ending slowly evolves as the movies progresses, climaxing about three-fourths of the way into it. Right from the start I began wondering what was going on, then I moved to a sense that something wasn't right with this village and the village elders that ran it, then I slowly began to realize what the reality was. All of it was confirmed, and then the movie began the wind down and finally ended. When it ended we were left basically where we left off, with the status quo uninterrupted. This is probably where the unexpected comes in, because in Shyamalan's past films the world around the main characters has totally changed, along with their view of it. But in  The Village  the world is left roughly the same, except for the obvious characters who have always know what has been going on. All the actors made great performances in this film and really gave it a lot of depth. Of these I recognize Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, and newcomer Bryce Howard (the main characters). The other actors were great as well, but it was the main characters that stood out and gave  The Village  its soul.  The main characters are as follows: Edward Walker (William Hurt), the de facto leader of the village and the one man the village elders, who make the decisions, look to for guidance. We quickly realize that it was him who first established the settlement, along with the rest of the elders who agreed to follow him. Then there's Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), the quiet young man who knows no fear and seems to be curious about the woods, the creatures, and the world outside (known as "the towns"). The character of Noah (Adrien Brody) is a mentally disabled young man, essentially a little boy in a man's body. And there's Ivy Walker (Bryce Howard), who is the younger daughter of Edward Walker. She is blind, but she is smart as a whip and can see more than most people (a cliche, I know, but she pulls it off in a subtle and non-clicheic way). All four characters are involved in the story in some way and make the story happen. The other characters are nice and very well acted, but are simply backdrop.  I've debated whether or not to provide spoilers, but I can do this fairly well without. The one thing I really liked was that the movie was essentially a voyage of discovery for the viewer. We aren't shown the truth about the village or the circumstances in one sudden twist as in  The Sixth Sense  or  Signs . It is slowly revealed and we slowly begin to see what's going on, with our suspicions confirmed at the climax. Many Shyamalan fans who are now accustomed to his now clicheic twist endings might rebel against this, but it doesn't detract from the film. It was a conscious choice by Shyamalan and it worked.  Another nice twist that I liked was in Joaquin's character. He's not the hero in the film. You think that he might be based not only on the massive advertising, but also based on his fearlessness of the creatures and his eagerness to venture into the woods. But in the end he is not the one who enters the woods and confronts the creatures. Its the one person you would not expect, and not want to enter the woods (actually there are two that enter, the second being the one you don't want to enter, depending on how you feel about the character). And there's also a minor hero in William Hurt's character when he agrees to the journey and defends his decision vigorously to the elders. The villain in the movie is two-fold. On one end it is Adrien Brody and the action his character takes that leads to the unfolding of the story. The second is the village elders and their secret, and one might interpret their choice as a denial of the truth and freedom, as well as the perpetuation of fear. But they have their reasons and when you learn of them you tend to feel sympathetic and understand, even if you don't necessarily agree with them.  The advertising for the film is rather interesting. They've basically pulled a  urlLink  Master and Commander   on us. We all thought  Master and Commander  would be this big action flick; a  urlLink  Gladiator   on the high seas. The reality was that it was more dramatic and visual than action packed. The same is true with  The Village , although it may end up biting Shyamalan and the distribution company in the ass. Its billed as a horror/suspense/thriller. Its none of those things, at least completely. It is not a horror film because of the discovery nature of the picture. Horror films are packed with fast-paced action sequences that scare you, and  The Village  has few, if any, of these. Certainly not enough to qualify as a horror film. There are elements of suspense in the film, but they are quickly resolved (minus the main "battle" sequence that serves as the climax). Same for the thriller aspects. Its a voyage of discovery and a story of the village and why it is there, with elements of suspense mixed in.  The problem is that people now expect suspense and thriller movies from Shyamalan. Part of this is his own fault for making three of these types of films in a row. The other part is also the ad campaign for  The Village . With  Master and Commander  there was not only a sense that there was some drama in it, but there was some great action in it as well. But with  The Village  not only has Shyamalan painted himself into a corner with his past three flicks, but when people go to see a horror/thriller movie they want exactly that. This movie has no horror and little thriller, if any. And while it looks beautiful and was very well shot, it doesn't have the gorgeous shots that make  Master and Commander  a truly great film.  Master and Commander  was a celebration of old naval life on the high seas. One cannot say the same about  The Village . There is a sort of admiration of the simple way of life that shines through, but there's nothing that comes close to the celebration of nature that we get from  Master and Commander ; in fact, one might say we get the opposite. Therefore, many will definitely be disappointed. As I walked out of the theater, I believe I overheard one teenager say to his friend that the movie "sucked". That's because it wasn't what they came to see. Of course, this movie isn't exactly aimed at the teenage or college demographic, but still. I dare say its like going to see a movie billed as a science fiction film, only to discover its closer to the present day and not so much science fiction as you were led to believe.  That being said, go see the movie. Its definitely worth your money. Its different from Shyamalan's past stuff, but in a good way. He hasn't quite gotten out of that twist ending corner he has put himself into, but he's done a good job at working his way out. He proves once again that he is a great filmmaker.

      I'm watching a documentary on CNN titled "True Believers: Inside the Rise and Fall of Howard Dean", fascinated by the behind-the-scenes look of that campaign.&nbsp; It seems like it was just yesterday yet at the same time so long ago that the primary campaign was rumbling along.&nbsp; It will have been a year come mid-August that I began really tuning in to the election, with my first enthusiastic reactions pointed squarely at Dean.&nbsp; That marked the beginning of&nbsp;the election adventure I immerse myself into every four years.&nbsp; This election adventure actually happens every two years, but its the presidential elections that really get me high.&nbsp; Its so lively, and its a national excitement.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; I've loved it ever since 1988 when I first discovered the fun that are elections.&nbsp; Starting in 1992 I've been hooked.&nbsp; The most fun I can think of is sitting with friends watching the election results come in.&nbsp; Now its 2004 and the second presidential election I will participate in, and my excitement is beyond explanation.   the 2004 election began for me&nbsp;in the summer of 2003.&nbsp; It was mid-August and I watched one of the debates.&nbsp; I was immediately struck by Howard Dean and his seemingly straight talk manner.&nbsp; I was actually&nbsp;pretty enthusiastic about him.&nbsp; But after a day or two of thinking about him, my enthusiasm subsided.&nbsp; Dean seemed very attractive, especially to younger voters like myself, but something seemed off.&nbsp; I immediately began to question him and his rise to the top, and quickly became convinced that he was not what he seemed.&nbsp; Something was off, and I knew his rise was premature and headed for a crash.&nbsp; Then there was the cult that surrounded Dean.&nbsp; I've never been one to worship&nbsp;a man, and I wasn't going to start.&nbsp; It was too much, and I knew it wouldn't last.   In my research of the others (those who had a chance, mind you) I came across a most unlikely contender that wasn't: General Wesley Clark.&nbsp; I've liked the man ever since 1998 and Kosovo Campaign.&nbsp; He's about the smartest man alive, and I immediately took a liking to the man.&nbsp; He was up front, smart, and I knew right then that he was my candidate.&nbsp; I signed the "Draft Clark" petition and expressed my full support for him.&nbsp; I'm proud to say I was a part of the draft movement, and the joy I felt when he finally announced was simply grand.   I donated $120 to his campaign.&nbsp; That's how strongly I felt about General Clark.&nbsp; I believed then, and still believe, that he would have been the best candidate to run against President Bush.&nbsp; But it wasn't to be.&nbsp; He came in immediately not as the anti-Dean, but as the alternative to Dean.&nbsp; People like myself who were wary of Dean looked at the General and liked what they saw.&nbsp; Many supported the General.&nbsp; And many more declared the General their second choice.&nbsp; General Clark rose to the top and began to give Dean a nice scare.&nbsp; The closer New Hampshire got, the more and more it looked like the General might pull an upset.&nbsp; And that is exactly what would have happened.   Then Kerry came out of nowhere, along with Edwards, and stole the show in Iowa.&nbsp; Clark had chosen not to campaign there, believing it was too late for him to&nbsp;achieve any sort of formidable presence there.&nbsp; He was wrong.&nbsp; He has even admitted that he was wrong.&nbsp; Edwards and Kerry proved that Clark could have done great things there had he only diverted some of his money into establishing a campaign in the state.&nbsp; Instead Kerry rose to the top, winning back supporters that had bolted him earlier for Clark and other candidates when Kerry's campaign appeared to be near collapse.&nbsp; Kerry also recovered much of the veteran vote that Clark had recently held.&nbsp; Walking into New Hampshire Kerry saw a significant bounce that pushed Clark into a third place tie with Edwards, who himself came out of nowhere in Iowa after spending very little time and money in the state.&nbsp; Come New Hampshire, Clark would come in third, but it was a weak third that he barely won from Edwards.&nbsp; I had told those on the General's&nbsp;blog that he would have to finish second in New Hampshire; third or less and we would lose the nomination.&nbsp; They didn't believe me, but I turned out to be correct.&nbsp; It was crushing.&nbsp; I stayed loyal, but I could see the proverbial writing on the wall.&nbsp; Clark had lost that night.   Now its late-July and I'm getting ready to watch the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; Its an exciting time, if bittersweet.&nbsp; I sit here contemplating the what-ifs and what-might-have-beens.&nbsp; After moving over into the Bush camp in late-April, I've moved back into the undecided category where I started nearly a year ago.&nbsp; I have soured on President Bush and his social conservatism (the only conservatism the man holds).&nbsp; Kerry is no better at this point, following the advice of one of his favorite sports, para-surfing, and going in whichever direction the wind takes him.&nbsp; I don't believe he would be any better than Bush, but he certainly couldn't be any worse.   So now I've relegated myself to a simple observer, reveling in the excitement of the election.&nbsp; I have my Clark paraphernalia readily visible, and I'm feeling the excitement of so long ago.&nbsp; Now the real fun begins.
