      It was a graduation party for my friend (who will be attending MIT, Yay!) that had too many different groups of people. Since she was sort of a social butterfly, her party consisted of old friends, newer friends, track buddies, church buddies, and sisters' friends. The guests split into three sections of her house in which the part I was at decided to create chaos. It started with the infamous prickly pear omletes. My pyromania returned (we made s'mores after swimming. My first s'more! so I learned more about American culture and how it was friendly to quasi-pyromaniacs) as I burned the little spines off and then had the joy of skinning the plant.  Amidst talks of how awful the prickely pear omletes were the last time my friend made and the slimy texture of dissected plant, we decided to make a smoothie. It's consistency was very much similar to saliva and that marked the start of a party joke. Everyone tried it, some hated it while others tolerated the neutral taste. Of course, things went downhill when one of my partners in crime decided to announce how it was like saliva. Lovely thing to say about something I worked hard to de-pricklify. Of course, boredom is sometimes the key ingredient of ingenuity or insanity so we got another prickly pear pad and blended it up with random ingredients to make... a "facial mask".  There were oatmeal and melon so it should exfoliate...

      Went fishing yesterday... well, it was more of my parents fishing while I read Catch-22. Still need to finish that book. Anyhow, we got back late at night so I got to witness crazy, insane drivers. On one of the major and rather deadly intersections, someone drove through the intersection about two seconds before their light turned green. Isn't that how accidents happen? Impatienly anticipating the light?  Anyhow, my leg reminded me it was going to be June soon since it started to spasm. It happens every year, usually right before swim team. The good news is that it does that and I grow about half an inch during the summer... yet the doctors say I won't be growing anymore. Humph.  Ah, and just when I was about to clean my college files, I got more. The fact that so many "elite" colleges are sending me the "interested" letters are making my ego quiver in a very bad way. They make it seem easy to be accepted... but then again, how many "interested" letters do they send out and how many students are actually accepted? And of course, to add insult to injury, or vice versa, Harvard's office of admissions sent one of those letters too with the conclusions being something like "of course, getting into a college like Harvard is a competitive process..." making me feel insignificant. One good day on my PSATs suddenly make me "smart". No matter what the colleges say, test scores  are  highly important. And that makes me whimper since my English grammar is dismal... Chinese doesn't have a thing called tenses so we don't need to conjugate and worry about keeping the tenses straight. Grr.  *** and I am still trying to persuade my parents on that national convention program. Really want to go, but costs are kinda high. For a person who hates fundraising -- asking people for money, basically -- I feel like I am sitting in boiling water.

      It's one thing to be woken up wiht your mother excited about a fishing trip... It's a whole new world when you are doused with philosophy, more specifically evaluations of evaluations of marxist philosophy right after you are mentally awake.  Oh dearie... apparently my dad won't let me sign up to go to the Republican National Conventiion unless I get MARXISM in my head. Honestly... I don't see how it connects, but I really want to go see a real life party convention. It would be interesting and I get to find out more about various aspects of American politics.  Right now, I must prove that I can understand and utilize Marxism/Maoism so I could get the $2,400 tuition and airfare to go. Oh dear, it's going to be a long summer with philosophy, art history, and biology every day.

      There are moments in life where people decide to just start over... or at least the sociology textbooks and fictional books say there are. Oh, and my parents telling me mind the clock since I am getting older and the likelihood being able to change decreases. Well, I am switching blog hosts again... for the second time since March. If the chameleon actually made it on the Chinese Zodiac, I should be born that year.  What prompted my decision to change? Well, letters from colleges and extremely expensive summer programs and death of my band director and jasmine blooming and a mix of a viral infection and allergies -- just life in general. And since it's summer, I thought a change might be good for my sanity... knowing there is still something I can control in my own life is always a plus.  So this is just a rather wordy introduction.

      Sometimes there are so many things going on that you don't have a coherent way of describing all that's happening. Anyhow... What's happening? Lots but nothing unusual. I did get my paycheck awhile back which made me wonder about the longevity of social security. Um, how long will it last? With all the political analysts and people in that crowd complaining about the government deficits and the Bush administration, I now wonder if the $21 deducted for social security and Medicare will ever be returned to my possession. So... Maybe I should major in economics when I'm in college?  Speaking of which... I need to update my senior resume for my counselor, like what I did during the summer and what not. Oh, and one of the funnier things in college planning: keep track of the process. Hmm, what am I supposed to write? I really want to get into UPENN or Yale and I am worried that I will be out of town again when the Yale representatives come? And..Ohoh yes, my various new additions to my already long list of colleges to apply for. Oh dearie... It's already getting stressful.

      I had hiccups the entire day... Well, it was more of during two-hour intervals. The birthday party I attended was for a six-year-old so I ended up being the unofficial babysitter/mother/sister. It was AWFUL! There is a reason why I do not ever babysit. Some people say it's a good way to earning money, but I prefer a job like research or even filing papers. For one, I can't stand insubordinate children. You ask them to do one thing and they do another. When you get strict, tears flood and I start crying too... *shudder* There were at least ten children under the age of ten. Aack! I never got to work on writing of any sort. It seems I will be busy completing an art history paper while trying to finish a chapter of biology. Oh crappie.

      I did plan a visit to the art museum today for research for my art history paper, but that ended up as a messy trip. Amidst cries of a lost cell phone (my parents'), sleeping in a little too many hours, and unsuspectingly placing a binder on an wooden desk that was a piece of art (oopsy... And sorry for the umpteenth time), I found my paintings for analysis within five minutes of stepping into the museum. Of course, the fact that it was a rather small building for a state university made it easier. If I were at the Metropolitan Museum, it would take me half the day to find one painting even with directions from people who work there. Then I miscalculated the time it would take me to gather the notes for the paintings and yeah... I ended up waiting outside for a half an hour before I got picked up. Yep, opted for heat instead of the freezing museum.  Afterwards, a party at a friend's. Silent Marco Polo demonstrated how I was lousy at finding people with my eyes closed. Honestly... It was one of the more embarrassing moments of my life. Of course, embarrassment reached a peak when I ended up over turning in a backwards somersault and rammed by elbows onto the steps and my head connected with the decorative but hard rocks at the rim of the pool. I guess I could blame the desert theme of the pool for the red scratches on my elbow. Eekies. At last, I was deemed incapable of playing board games (along with the inability to play pool games) when I was "killed" after four rounds of rolling the dice. Meh, I did get a cute little llama finger puppet from the party host. She just got back from Peru and I got a new addition to my postcard collection! It's a rocky condor... Or rather the floor plan of an Incan ruin was in the shape of a condor.  Now I am back home wondering when I would have time to actually finish Catch-22 for my book club composed of the friends at the party. Technically, I should have been done by the last weekend of May and for June, Eragon and The Solitaire Mystery. Definitely need to catch up on reading since we are to finish Sinclair's The Jungle by next weekend.

      I need the Borrowers story to be true. If it is, I may seem less like a lunatic in the lab. Honestly... The racks do have legs or there are people "stealing" them! So I was working on assays (DNA activity) so I had a rack containing 24 DNA combinations lined up on them. After I was done gathering the data, I moved the rack, my lab notes to the lab station. They were all there when I left to edit the data and make charts. It was still there when I returned twenty minutes later to record the day's work in the lab notebook and to clean up my mess. In the five minutes between me dumping the samples in the trash and putting away another set of DNA, the rack was GONE! It went *poof* and disappeared leaving me to rant like a lunatic because that was the only rack that was christened as mine, and I use it everyday! In shorter time for me to notice my disappearing rack, my mother decided to let me get a different rack from her stash of lab equipment... Guess what? I found my rack nicely stacked in the back.  So the mystery remains... Who took my rack or who was the unfortunate nice person who put away my stuff before I got to take care of it?     Quick comments about lab stuff:   There gloves should adjust for people with strange thumbs. The between the thumb and index finger should be made closer to the wrist so the tips of the gloves don't get caught when snapping the lid of a tube shut.  If a hazardous waste bucket is getting old, people should replace it before it actually cracks and floods the vacuum hood with the hazardous waste.  Trash should be emptied at least once every two weeks... Decomposing pipette tips are so gross.

      My first seminar! It was about pigmentation and how DNA testing could determine a person's appearance... to an extent. For example, from looking at the responses of certain genes to promoters, one could infer the hair color and eye color of the person. Skin color cannot determined since people do tan and change easily.  Unfortunately, I lack the basic knowledge to understand the scientific diagrams of the pigmentation cells so that was pointless. Poopy.  Here's the one thing I learned today: there are 4 kinds of albinism so one can't say a person is an albino because they look light. To truly know, one must look up the family background of the person and determine the difference.  Point that I think I understood and found was new: red hair and hazel eyes could be signs of albinism... I think (I reiterate).

      It's so strange... maybe I should read some more marine biology books. My parents bought home mussels from Costco and it became a dish. Personally, I don't like the squishiness of the thing, but since my dad made it, I decided I probably should try. Despite the texture of the mussel, the sauce my dad made tasted yummy. So it was more of eating mussels for the taste of the sauce. Meh. anyhow, I starting chewing on some hard stuff, which was a pain with my braces. Now, if you know anything about pearls, you would know that they are rather hard. So ouchy jaw. I never thought I could find tiny pearls in mussels, but I guess it makes sense since they are kinda like the oysters that made pearls. The way they eat is similar so the extra stuff oysters get to make pearls could be eaten by mussels.

      Follow up from the last post... I seriously doubt my own sanity at this point. Currently, I am laughing hysterically at my own plight. It's so strange to worry about an exam for art history when my friends are vacationing in Macchu Piccu or at a summer camp or merely lounging at home with a good book. My perception of what a person should do during summer vacation definitely matured or mutated to something like work in the summer, work in the school year, and work some more. I love the notion of work hard and play hard, but I need to find time to play hard. Guess that's what I'll be doing during the weekend. Somehow play, read for art history and biology, clean the house, and followups for my experiments all at the same 24-hour block.  I'm hopeless at this point.

      One of the first things I said to myself after school got out was "I'm going to have a nice long break. No stress, just fun." Guess what happened? Apparently I am already a workaholic in training. My day is insane. From work to art history to work to home and teaching myself ecology while learning what I need to know for art history. Gah, it's like school almost.  And my computer is giving me problem... I had a lovely entry typed up yestreday. Just as I was completing my last word, Internet Explorer crashed. Bye bye babble and hellooo blank screen. Grrr.

      I don't know whether not I should be embarrassed about this . . . The exact scenario of my parents getting "hitched", as the saying goes, was basically fuzzy to me until yesterday. Before then, all I knew was they they met in college and their friends pushed them together and then they got married. At a tense meeting with my great-grandmother, I realized my relatives only found out they were getting married two days before meeting the official people for the marriage license. Great-grandma got miffed, planned a ceremony of sorts the day before my birthdate in three years and then life went on.     Among other things, I finally got to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban... Wow, what a wonderfully hilarious movie. The humor was nice. I laughed a lot. The laughter-filled time was enough to drown out the noises of a rude audience. Cellphones (of reluctant parents who brought their children to view for probably the third time) rang throughout the film while the people behind me made jokes the entire time. Geez, people were behaving like they were in front of their own televisions instead of in a public theatre. Oh well... I did get a good laugh. My only prickly point about the movie is how it didn't seem to flow well. The multiple shots of the Whopping Willow smacking a bird was humorous, but it did get kind of boring... or maybe the constant chatter and snorts from people behind me ruined that.

      Why I chose to take this course? Well, my counselor said it would be an enlightening environment and the course would help me expand my base of trivia knowledge to something other than calculus, chemistry, physics, US history, partial history of UK (and France, USSR/Russian Federation, Mexico, Cuba, China, and Nicaragua), and biology. So she said art history would be one of those courses that would come in handy when I am having an informal chat with my future employer... Guess she has some high expectations for me. Anyhow, facts I learned today that I thought would be interesting to share:   The Medici family sponsored a pirate to climb the papal hierarchy. The man eventually did become the pope. Women did paint. They mostly painted manuscript illuminations, so like picture books. There is an International Gothic style in painting that characterize the images in many of my picture books. It's houses are in a cutaway style to show what's inside and out and the people are a lot bigger than the trees and buildings. And last one right now, perspective -- the way to arrange a painting in a specific fashion although most likely in the most realistic fashion -- was created by Brunelleschi in 1424. The name of this perspective is linear perspective which aids the creation of three dimensional forms to make the subjects stand out with substance instead of a paper doll.   Well, this is the quick and superficial summary of my art history day. I am mainly concerned about how I can conduct experiment when I have to leave in the middle of the morning to go to my art history class. Today, I started the transformation and completed it when I returned only because the bacteria could wait three hours before I needed to do something. So my lab work seems to be very little right now, not enough to even fill a page in my lab notebook.  And to continue my worries, only for the opposite reason, I am wondering how I could teach myself ecology while half self-teaching myself art history and do experiments as well as do my mandatory cathartic writing task all before any of my deadlines. Icky... This feels as tight as school only I don't feel like I am doing anything for lab. And that didn't make much sense so I should go back to reading my art history text.

      Either I am spoiled or the syllabus for Art History is completely pointless. Sure we have topics to review for the next lecture, but where?! There isn't a chapter specifically for High Renaissance nor are there any for Neoclassical or Romanticism. Grr... no reply from teacher.  More Grr... the umpteenth Grr for the day.

      I now have an art history teacher that is a stickler for proper student behavior. That means I HAVE to show up to class on time. It might be problematic since I depend on the university tran to take me to class from my internship . . . public transportation ruling how much my teacher will like me. Not too comforting, especially since I got lost three days trying to get to the fine arts section of uni and getting back to the lab. Walking in swirlies is not fun when the temperature is over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  In the afternoon, I had to sit through 3 hours of lab safety lecture. Grr, it's was all common sense. I almost fell asleep. Speaking of which, that's what I am doing right now.

      Needed to vent. Just about freaked out by the fact that my Art History class starts tomorrow yet my text book hasn't arrived yet!!! Online shopping is gradually depreciating in my mind. Too many hassles and I am just getting more and more untrusting because of it. GAH! I want my book... It's just not right to take a book from an academic freak. *wailing*  Okay, so I paid for standard delivery... yet the person mailed it under media mail of US Postal Office. Grr... cheap, slow delivery. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr! Media mail is like around one dollar. I paid almost four dollars for shipping...  *breathing in and out... relatively calmly... will speak with professor*

      It's summer. In my short term decision during AP week, I opted for the June SAT testing time for my subject tests. Three tests, three hours, oh my poor sanity. For me, I hate the whole bias regarding time distribution. You get less than a minute for each writing multiple choice while you have more than a minute for math problems. There is something wrong with that, at least for a person with English as a second language.  Oh phoofy, and then I get teased by college promotion letters saying how I could be accepted if I try... um a bit late for that seeing as I will be a senior in the upcoming year. Ah, it's life.  And then I get home, open up my computer, and get greeted with various online news places showing all the articles regarding the death of former President Reagan. And he was one of my favorite presidents during modern US history. I didn't really like his supply-side economics, but then again, I don't like any president's economic policy.

      My first job started on Tuesday. And since then, I've been exhausted because my supervisor is a slave driver and also my mother. Lovely working in the same lab as her... It doesn't matter though, pipeting is my kind of fun. It's rather boring when you have to do that over and over and over again in the replication process of the DNA by feeding E. coli bacteria (which I did for my seventh grade science experiment), but I actually get to do something interesting.  My list of what I have done so far:   DNA restriction enzyme digestion helped in the ligation and transformation process DNA purfication   So, what did I find out in my long series of pipeting and shaking? Well, the DNA I did the digestion on was screwy... it was the wrong DNA. Ha! Take that, you person. So my mother was running the experiment on the wrong DNA... good for her for suspecting it, bad for whoever gave her that DNA. Then we did DNA purification and our results got worse as time went on, so my partner in crime and I were allowed to go home.  Other discoveries:  I hate driving, particularly during traffic hour I hate milk and growing old because I am not a bit more partially lactose intolerant I LOOOOVE pippettes =P and any squishy apparatus in the lab I hate the smell of the medium and bacteria... worse than sour milk I am stuck in Catch-22 and I can do nothing about that My handwriting is pretty   Now I will see if I could get the picture of my gel on here to show the world...

      Oh lovely. I got my driver's license today. Passed the exam without problems and now I am stuck with the job of running errands. Considering I absolutely dislike driving, having to make quick shopping trips and basically be the errand person, I probably will be hyperventilating for the first month of being an official driver. Honestly, city drivers are so darn insane... and intracity "highways" are the home to lunatic drivers -- think traffic lights and driving at 60/70 mph.  The truly lovely part of my day: I GOT A DIGITAL CAMERA! Yep, very happy. It's tiny and cute and I'm going to bring it with me everywhere!!!  It's a wonderful day.... and I don't feel like complaining about what I was going to complain about. *smile*

      I love the rain... always loved to play in it and such when I lived in China. The lovely humidity, the plethora of green, and of course, the light rain showers of southwestern China just makes it seem like the perfect rainy time experience. Not much thunder and lightening, so it was perfect for kids. I remember stomping in the puddles and getting my skirt wet and dirty. And when I got home, my parents or grandparents would lecture me about getting sick and ruining the skirt. &nbsp; Of course, rain in the dry desert of the American Southwest is much different. The times when we really get rain is during the monsoon season. A storm like tonight -- thunder, lightening, lights blinking -- characterize my new favorite type of rain. While I can't go outside and play in it... at least during night time... it's so much fun watching the water pounding on the streets. And one has to love the streamy look the falling rain by the street lights. It's just great... and relaxing although the trees outside sways violently, an enjoyable contrast to the quiet serenity of home with dimlights and the television echoing the flashes of lightening. &nbsp; *** I am in no way disturbed. As I reread what I wrote, I sounded somewhat psychotic with the whole transition from a spring shower to a monsoon storm. Anyhow, I just like water a lot.

      Grrr..... Icky, very icky. &nbsp; Reasons why I dislike milk:   I am partially lactose intolerant -- limited consumption of ice cream and highly regulated consumption of whipped cream (whose absence makes Italian Sodas not that interesting)  Growth hormones for milk cows also in milk as well and my thryroid goes biserk. Swollen throat is  not  fun at all. It makes me choke really easily   Sniffles... now I am pretty much on a soy diet. Not that soy is bad, but I still have this little wish of getting at least one inch taller. I mean, 5 feet 5.5 inches is somewhat average. And of course, I can't stand having also those fives. It's spiteful... darn AP exams.

      I am a perfectionist that could care about nothing. Really, I get so serious about something and then if provoked, I drop it like a hot potatoe... or how I drop a china plate when I find creepy crawlers on it -- got yelled at by my grandmother for dropping China awhile back due to ants.  It's pathetic how I want my braces off. Kind of like: "I don't care about appearances; I want to feel my teeth!" Anyhow, my orthodontist appointment is tomorrow, and I am at the point in which I could get my braces off. HOwever, my bite is still screwy and the rubberbands are useless. Grrr... half of me want it all over and the perfectionist half demand perfection.  Having a sloven and a perfectionist living in the same brain is pure torture.

      This is probably very superficial, but my mood does change rather quickly.  So my mother and I went to the lab this morning. Bad news first: my lab partner person's transformation was bad... The agar got toasted since the plate wasn't covered. Good news: There were extra bacteria so we could regrow them. Only problem is the 24-hr delay. Good news: MY PCR DIDN'T GET RUINED! I'm just happy that the machine broken near the end of the program since it all replicated without a problem (at least for set one and two). I found negative and positive results, so it wasn't a fluke. The results were real, I suppose.  Anyhow, my break is about to be over... The gel is almost set so I need to check the rest of the sets. Phew, I hope they are all perfect little PCR products...

      There's something about technology that doesn't get along with me. First my web server thing wouldn't let me log in. Or rather, internet explorer cannot find the server to the login page 8 out of the 10 times I try. Grr... can't change stuff and it's just plain frustrating. Anyhow, on a more serious level, the PCR cycler at work broke on me. 72 reactions was pretty much all ruined. Oh poo...

      Wow... I love going on vacation. A week in nature is the best medicine for everything. So I should have my muse back then. Of course, in all vacation planning, it's a cost/benefit decision as well as ruling by preference. After so much of art history, I really want to go to a large museum and just stare at wonderful works all day. Also, Alcatraz, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf -- all places in San Francisco that I want to see.  So, either Yosemite or San Francisco... hmmm, tough decision that isn't allotted much time.

      I'm frustrated so I'm going to whine about what's bothering me.  The experiment I am working on is getting nearly no where. I retrieved the targeted DNA from my PCR product but for some reason, after I retrieved the DNA from the gel, there was nearly nothing left. I hope my ligation product will actually be enough to complete the transformation process. Otherwise, the plate will have no bacteria on it... grr!  My muses have deserted me. I can't draw and I can't write. It's driving me insane. So my refuge now is to read... Eragon is rather interesting. I do wonder when the next book is out. The plot is finally standing on its own.  Unfortunately, my last resort of creation is at a dead end. Since I understand nothingness of php whatevers, I cannot find out how to turn on register_globals. It's a security risk, but kind of necessary for the script I found and since I am rather stupid on webbie stuff, I can't modify the code. Oh poo.  Amidst the rest of my personal problems, last night was a party for drunkards as two of them found the area around my house as a lovely resting place. Not feeling very safe at the moment... In addition to everything, I desire a vacation very much. *begging for some time off for some part of my consciousness*

      I really do worry about my own sanity sometimes... I think I am already developing symptoms of being a workaholic. Insomnia, anxiety, and the constant heavy load of work I need to take care of. It's just absolutely lovely. Model UN paperwork for the school board, applications for various programs, my senior resume -- all waiting to be taken care of and completed tomorrow. I really ought to study for my final now.  And it's not a good sign that I want to give up... grrr. I have way too many voices in my head. It's no hard to make a decision with so many voices giving me suggestions.

      It's ironic, just like the rest of life. When a person achieves or is close to achieving something, the joy makes her dizzy... Or this may just be life in my world. Anyhow, my art history class will be done on July 8th and I completed my biology assignment. This sense of completion and basically and open summer sort of made me into a ditz than a workaholic.  Strangeness of the day:    I started the day with conversation about swimming up the river of de-Nial with sunscreen as protection.   My breakfast consisted of fruit. Supposedly healthy, but I basically didn't have breakfast. I think my dad think I may have an eating disorder... Erm, I don't have a problem with my body weight although I can make myself throw up on cue, but that;s due to my allergies and nasal drip that causes me to choke.   I had pancakes for dinner. Also, Asian family making pancake... Not a pretty sight. Of course, the one person in the house that can't cook Chinese food makes the perfect pancakes. Unfortunately, my mother's cooking isn't always consistent. At least I can sort of make pancakes...   I have decided that I needed a best friend. As in singular... One friend that I can depend on and chat freely without feeling the need to pretend.   Adding onto the list... My dad thinks I have insomnia. Hm, that was determined awhile ago.    Well, must go to sleep before my dad goes ballistic about being healthy.

      Don't use one-dollar words when you can use a 50-cent word... gah, heard that too many times in English class, particularly my sophomore English class. Of course, that was rebutted when I took a college English course and proved meaningful fluff gave me a very good A for the class. Hmm... Maybe you should lather the generic "it" thick like the Baroque artists.  Meh... 5 hours of sleep and I've been drowsy for the entire day. To think, I was able to handle that during the school year. Oh well, perhaps this had to do with the fact that insomnia is back and I am not used to it. I need to get used to it soon though. I can't always cling on 10 hours of sleep... *wail* I dun wanna grow up!

      I would love to tell the world how much faith I have for the people living in it and I would be absolutely ecstatic if I could say I could depend on all my close friends. It's a pity that every time I get close enough to consider a friend a life long close friend, my little bubble of optimism pop as I begin to regain my sight of a person. It seems like I have semi-clear judgment of a person at first impression then I start turning a blind eye on all their deficiencies as a person. When I start trusting the person completely, all my expectations collapse as the person's dependability is laughable. It's rather pitiful how my social life is. No wonder I come off as aloof when people first meet me. I guess my multiple failures in finding THE best friend left some scars.  Oh well, I guess the overused quote "if you want to do something right, do it your self" does have its merits...  Although I didn't want to do what I have to do in the first place.

      7 days without Internet access. Yep, I was whining, complaining, freaking out, annoying the hell out of the program coordinators, and wanting to kill fellow MUN people that were a bit slow in understanding messages.  From last Sunday until Saturday… The economics camp was disappointing as an academic camp. I learned absolutely nothing new about economics. It was the polar opposite for the leadership portion. Personally, I think I grew as a person due to the experience in having to be squished with the other campers in nearly all activities. Closeness (literally and figuratively speaking) definitely gave me a whole new outlook on life. Honestly, who would have thought I would be hugging people – more like clutching strangers for my life – after only a “hello”? I would suggest for all to go to the program, although please take note that the economics is at the most superficial level. Just for those wondering, the program is called Economics for Leaders of the Foundation for Teaching Economics. You can find more information about it at  urlLink http://www.fte.org/ .  Sunday… today Quite a lot of pictures taken with me whining about the car going so fast. Other notable events? Well, the Costco gas station closed 20 minutes before we got there. Exclamation of the day: Jeepers! Gas prices are at $2.35 per gallon of regular unleaded gas?!  Anyhoo, I mostly tried to perfect my photography skills… at least skills for photographing in a movie car. Below are some lovely pictures taken by yours truly.  *** I can't wait until I'm at Yosemite!!!!!!! Well, I am on the border. In the park would be great. I want to be hugging a tree! ***
