      We saw shrek 2 last night, tight ass tuesday. Very good movie, and we really enjoyed it. The theatre was filled with  kids, but I don't think the jokes are targetted to kids, but adults. Very well done.

      Went to the Dentist today. I hate dentists, I wouldn't go to one, unless there is any thing necessary to be done to it.  I had a filling a long time ago and the dentist siad, the dentist who did the filling before didnt do a good job, and it has rot to the bottom, therefore when i drink water, it hurts the nerves.  OH Boy!

      Just got into contact with my cousin, Steve. We haven't been keeping touch for over 5years now, as we are all busy with our lives and work. He was studying in the UK for 2 years and he lives in Hongkong (that's where my mum is from.)  Feel good to be in contact with him again.

      On sat, we went to Bridge Road to do some shopping, nothing in particular to buy. Drove past many times on the way home from Church and there are signages of sales everywhere.. Tempetations. So we went there for lunch and looked around at the shops. Picked up a cheap top from Cotton On for $10. Good Buy!  Sun: sat on my ass all day and played games on the computer. Good way to spend a sunday.
