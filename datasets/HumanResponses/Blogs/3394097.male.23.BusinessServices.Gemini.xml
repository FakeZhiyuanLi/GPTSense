      Three weeks to graduation!  I have never been so conflicted about a major event like this before.  Nothing like achieving a life goal and being scared to death at the same time.  Oh well, I better get back to studying, otherwise all this fear will be for nothing.

      Great article in the NY Times today about  urlLink simplicity  and why technology needs to be designed around it.  The first thing that came to mind when I read this was the current trend to pack everything imaginable into a cell phone.  Maybe I'm just crazy but if I'm going to take a picture I'm going to take it on a real digital camera that has 3 megapixels and can sync easily with my computer.  I am currently in the market for a new phone but can not find any that fit the bill of simplicity while still taking advantage of useful new technology that really does make life easier (Bluetooth, predictive typing, etc..).  But I suppose this whole trend won't stop until we can watch tv on our phone while taking pictures of our friends and listening to the latest pop trash on the built-in mp3 player. Because everyone knows that we don't want devices that make current life more enjoyable, we want devices that don't leave us any time for our current life.

      Well I thought it was going to be close there, but it looks like the oil companies are going to survive.  Still, that gas boycott sure showed them!  I would have loved to hear the laughter yesterday at the big oil companies.

      The general assumption is that we Americans are pretty silly, even simple minded folk that just want to consume as fast and as much as we can.  Well I hate to say that the current reaction over the gas prices, as well as the well publicized "gas boycott", has simply proven this better than anything we could have ever done on purpose.  Until people realize that driving an Escalade actually does have an effect at the macro level we will not see wide spread change among american drivers.  So I guess it is ok to drive that Tahoe, just don't forget it when you go preaching to your friends about how this war is really just for oil.  And by the way, if you drive a civic twice as much as your neighbor drives his big SUV......well hopefully you see the point.

      On a personal note, I just wanted to mention that I graduated from Seattle Pacific University on Saturday!  It feels very strange to be done, like I'm caught between two worlds.  At least it will give me more time to pursue FreshPerspective and other opportunities.

      There is a great discussion going on about homeschooling and its effect on a child's manners at  urlLink Philip Greenspun's Weblog:  .  Make sure to check it out, especially the comments part.  It's good to see that the issue is being discussed, maybe over time more homeschooling discussions can develop that may eventually lead to reduced misunderstanding about the whole issue.  Also, great comment about "family schooling", that is truly the best homeschooling approach in my opinion.

      So I'm sitting here at the awesome new  urlLink Zoka Coffee Shop  in the U-district and I'm just thinking about all the sociologists that say that we as a society are becoming more isolated.  While I think they may have a point in some areas, I think that some things are actually getting better.   I say this because I am sitting at a small round table with three other people that I have never met before, and we are all sitting here peacefully doing our homework or what not.  Two of us are online via the free WiFi, and one is studying some printouts of something.  What I am most surprised about is that we all seem perfectly comfortable.  Strange thing is, you would never walk into a Starbucks and sit down at a table with someone else.  It seems that some of the smaller cafeÂ´s have succeed in creating an atmosphere of community that encourages us to sit closer and relax a little bit.  Who knows, we may even start talking to each other again!

      So it looks like Sprint may finally have a Bluetooth cellphone.  Both Nokia and Motorola have announced Bluetooth phones for the CDMA network, two plus years late!  I have avoided upgrading for two years because all you could get was a crappy picture phone.  Sorry, but if I want to take a picture I would like to be able to tell what the picture is.  But being able to have my contacts all up to date, now that is something useful.  I'm just hoping these phones hit the market before my old phone completely dies.
