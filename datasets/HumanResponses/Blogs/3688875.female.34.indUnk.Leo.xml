      Part 3  TITLE: Of Mice And Mbuna Fish 3/? AUTHOR: Bear DISCLAIMER: I don't own the characters, but Joss and Mutant Enemy etc do. In fact, I own nothing but an overactive imagination so please don’t sue me! RATING: PG SPOILERS: Season 5 AtS, post “Damage” PAIRING: Spike/Xander SUMMARY: AU.  Spike was bored, phoned Xander who is in Africa, read part 1 and 2 DISTRIBUTION:  If you really want it, just ask. FEEDBACK: Yes please NOTES:  I love slash, but can’t write it, so this is just general stuff.  It’s turning into a series, I know how it’s ending, but I’m stuck on the getting there.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Xander was dumbfounded.  He’d never expected to hear that voice again.  Maybe he had died after all.  “Hullo?  You there, mate?”  “Spike?  Is that really you?”  “Yeah, large as life and twice as bad.”  “What do you want?”    Xander couldn’t help the hostility colouring his voice.  They’d never been friends.  It wasn’t fair, once you were gone, you should stay gone.  Otherwise, how do you move on, how do you get on with your life.  “Heard ‘bout Anya.  Andrew said they fought bravely side by side.  Probably means she went saving his pathetic ass.  I wanted to say that I was sorry.  Knew she still meant a lot to you.”  This wasn’t what Spike had meant to say.  He’d meant to have a bit of fun, irritating the boy.  Now he was being all sympathetic and touchy-feely.  This might be even better though.  It really freaked people when he had a proper conversation with them.  Angel still couldn’t handle it, even after all this time.  “Well, thanks, I guess.  Anything else?”  “Just wanted a chat.  So what are you doing over there?”  “Sorting things out.  A lot has changed.”  “I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to talk about it.  Okay, well, what’s it like over there?”  “You’d love it – why don’t you come over, work on your tan.”  “Get Mr Snark!  I know what the weather’s like, I was in Africa not so long ago, you know.”  “Yes.”  Yes?  What sort of come back was that?  The silence was becoming awkward.  Spike began to have a horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach, and he knew it wasn’t the meds.  “Just what exactly are you doing over there?”  Spike asked, hoping that he was wrong.  “Finding out my heart’s desires”  Idiot!  If Xander was going to do what Spike thought, then he was going to get himself killed.  Spike had only just got through the trials himself.  “Gee, thanks a lot for your confidence.  Not that you need to know, but just to tell you, I’ve already done it.”  What?  Spike was sure he hadn’t spoken out loud.  “Well, I heard you.”  Spike looked at the phone, then looked again, not believing what he saw.  “Umm, Xander…”  “What?”  “The power’s gone.”  “What are you talking about?”  “The phone’s not working any longer.”  “Oh.”  TBC

      Listening to:  Somewhere only we know by Keane  You know, I sometimes wish that I could wake up in the morning and think "Great, it's Saturday" without realising a minute later that it's actually Tuesday.  All I want is a week full of Saturdays - is that too much to ask?  Well, yes, I guess so.  Leaving you now, but I'll be back soon.    I kinda want to slay the dragon.  Let's go to work.

      Second part of the Spander fanfic I'm writing  TITLE: Of Mice And Mbuna Fish 2/? AUTHOR: Bear DISCLAIMER: I don't own the characters, but Joss and Mutant Enemy etc do. In fact, I own nothing but an overactive imagination so please don’t sue me! RATING: PG SPOILERS: Season 5 AtS, post “Damage” PAIRING: Spike/Xander SUMMARY: Spike is bored DISTRIBUTION:  If you really want it, just ask. FEEDBACK: Yes please NOTES:  I love slash, but can’t write it, so this is just general stuff.  It’s turning into a series, I know how it’s ending, but I’m stuck on the getting there.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Xander now wished that he’d paid more attention in class.  Then he’d sure know the words to describe how he felt.  Somehow excruciating agony and overwhelming exhaustion were such pale imitations.  At least it was now over.  He’d survived.  As usual, he wasn’t quite certain how, but the simple fact that each breath was causing such pain reassured him.  He’d never felt so happy to be hurting.  It kinda took the edge off the disappointment.  He wasn’t really sure what he’d expected, but he had thought he would get some answers.  That’s why he went through with the trials.  Finally, he’d knelt there, battered and bloody, almost ready to keel over into darkness.  He heard the voice first.  “You have done well, human.  You have endured the required trials.”  “Damn right I have.”  Xander had spat back.  “What do you claim?”  “To know my heart’s own desires.”  The demon’s hand reached towards his chest, a flash of brilliant light and one word.  “Granted.”  Then darkness.  He’d woken sprawled across his bed in the hotel room, and he’d regretted it instantly.  The heat and the pain made sleep impossible.  So he lay there, unwilling to move.  Nothing for him to do but think.  He was pleased when the phone rang, stopping him sinking deeper into dark thoughts.  Gritting his teeth against the pain, he reached for the phone.  The display showed that it was Andrew’s number.  They’d all promised not to call him until later that week.  Panic set in – what was wrong?  Why did they need to contact him?  Despite the worry rising up, he couldn’t help the tiredness in his voice as he answered.  “What’s up?”  “Hey, Harris.  So where’s my mbuna fish then?”  finis

      Just spent an hour reading some very good fanfics - I love Yahoo Groups.  There are some people out there as strange as me.  And I have a bad feeling that there are still some that are even stranger...  Anyhoo, I'm actually feeling tired now, so I'm going to go to bed and see if I can't dream up the next chapter of the as yet still untitled series.  I know how it's going to end, just don't know which road to travel to get there.  Been listening to: The Reason by Hoobastank (hope that's spelt right?)  TTFN

      I'm a newbie writer, so this is a first time thingy for me, please be kind.  Now, I know that's just asking for trouble.  This is a bit of gentle Spander fanfic.  TITLE: Of Mice And Mbuna Fish 1/? AUTHOR: Bear DISCLAIMER: I don't own the characters, but Joss and Mutant Enemy etc do. In fact, I own nothing but an overactive imagination so please don’t sue me! RATING: PG (for a bit of language) SPOILERS: Season 5 AtS, post “Damage” PAIRING: Spike/Xander SUMMARY: Spike is recuperating and is bored.  Xander sent Andrew a Mbuna Fish. DISTRIBUTION:  If you really want it, just ask. FEEDBACK: Yes please NOTES:  I love slash, but can’t write it, so this is just general stuff, not even fluffy or mushy.  May turn into a series, I know I’m not done yet.  Just don’t know where to go next.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Scratch, scratch, scratch.  This was driving him nuts.  Those bloody mice had been running around in the wall cavity forever.  He couldn’t wait to get back some decent strength in his arms.  He would have smashed through the wall already and crushed their puny skulls.  Yea, Big Bad talk.  How the mighty have fallen.  He was William the Bloody, a feared Master Vampire, being driven gradually insane by sodding mice.  He grimaced at the thought.  He hated feeling this weak.   Reminds me too much of when I was Roller boy.  Suppose it reminds him as well.  No surprise he doesn’t visit.   Or it could have been the sign he couldn’t help once the drugs wore off.  He smirked at the thought.    Poor Fred, she had been so pleased that he’d fully recovered his motor skills that the “Wow, excellent, Spike” had been out of her mouth before she realised.  Angel hadn’t spoken to her for a good few hours.    No hardship there then for the chit.  So everything back to normal now.  Except no more picking on Tall, Dark and Brooding for the moment.    Not until Spike was reasonably sure he’d be able to get a few decent punches back in.  Right now he was bored.   B-O-R-E-D.   He hated to admit it, but times like this he missed old Sunnyhell.  Or rather he missed the folks and the millions of chances for mischief.  The guys here were just too busy to worry about him most of the time.  A wicked thought occurred to him.  Reaching over for his duster, he patted the pockets and found what he was looking for.  He switched the mobile on and started scanning the list of numbers.  They’d warned Andrew long ago to keep hold of his wallet around him, so he’d lost his phone instead.  It served him right for the whole hero worship thing.  Not that Spike wasn’t a little flattered maybe, just thought Andrew needed reminding that this particular hero was as likely to turn round and bite him as save him.  Well, maybe not, with the soul thing and all.  But over a century of evil doesn’t just go away like that.  There were a whole host of names that meant nothing to Spike.  Then…  Buffy.  No.  That conversation would not be fun.  Sides which, she knew exactly where to find him.  Dawn.  No.  He liked the niblet too much to pick on her.  Willow.  No fear – she’d probably put some mystical whammy on his ass.  Xander.  Perfect.  Spike dialled.  A sleepy voice answered.  “What’s up?”  “Hey, Harris.  So where’s my mbuna fish then?”  finis

      If you read this blog, as time goes on, you'll find out that I'm really into Buffy and Angel.  It's the excellent writing and acting as well as the delectable James Marsters, truely.*g*  So then, if anyone does read this, and has an opinion on what I'm going to say, please comment.  You're welcome to your opinion, whatever it is.  Does Angel still love Buffy?    Sure, he goes looking for her in "The Girl in Question" but forgets what colour eyes she has.  They're not blue.   He gives up the chance to be with her as a human in "I will remember you", whatever he says, he likes the champion/hero kick too much.   However, most tellingly, in "Heartthrob", he admits that he's accepted her death and he's pretty much okay with it.  Sure, he's had 3 months to come to terms with it, but this is a guy who still regrets what he did to Drusilla over a hundred years later.

      It's kinda strange that I'm not tired at the moment.  I've got very little sleep this last week and I'm still not tired.  Guess I'll just sit here and wait until I've got to go to bed or fall asleep here.  Sibling 3 is home at the moment and we're going to have pasta tomorrow. Yes, very random thoughts.  Reading at the moment:  S/X fic Listening to:  The Darkness
