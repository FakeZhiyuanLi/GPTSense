      June has been fairly dead as far as union gigs go. IATSE 873 has the Ice Princess (or something like that) beginning this week and I received a call from Rach saying she's heading a NABET 700 Feature some time this week that she wants me on, so hopefully I'll be working soonish. Apart from those I finished Strands last week, a new hair salon on Queen West. Was a small job, some internal copper graphics, the exterior facade and an inexpensive plexi sign with vinyl logo. Received a call last night from Casandra, a previous client from a few months back, she would like me to antique a large radiator in her tennants living room, do some touch ups to the bathroom walls, paint the enterance way and is now interested in having me antique the tub in her quarters....all good.  Funny the way this industry works, last month I had to beg for time off. Was called in to do a favour at Hotsets which turned into an 18 hour cluster fuck on an All Bran commercial. Used the subway set we worked on back in '98 for a Kellogg's commercial in Germany, turned out pretty decent considering it was a last minute job. Was also a good laugh working with mates from years back. True talent is hard to come by, teamed with a great work ethic, the ability to deal with tight time constraints, highly strung out, over worked artistic individuals, lack of food, coffee, lighting...we pulled it off without loosing our rag with each other and quite happily toddled off to Jamie's in the early am for a winge and a bevvy.  Also did a three day stint for Hotsets on the new Cure video. Hadn't a clue Robert Smith was still out and about- was a goth for quite a few years, though Fields of The Nephilim, Sisters, Morrissey...was more my thing. Pulled a 10, 12 and 16 hour shift back to back on a holiday weekend so the pay cheque was nice. Unfortunately, it was a day or so after the 18 hr shift, basically the favour was an extended one :) I had run out of clean clothing, didn't have my kit with me as I hadn't expected to do more work after the All Bran gig, the shop was closed and I ended up having to do wood graining with my fingers LOL. Shit happens :)

      Rachels gig turned out to be a series called the News Room, a CBC production, straight paint, nothing very exciting but it paid decently. Was quite an odd experience really as whilst I was busy rebuilding the corners of a window wall I looked up to see a tall blonde bloke wandering round the set with the lighting crew, took a second to register but when it did I near on fell off my ladder, the blonde was a guy named Otto whom I dated for a short while 20 years ago. Scarily he looked exactly as I had remembered him, still has the long hair and the 'rocker' thing goin on. Fuck I'm old and it never even hit me till that very moment. Certainly doesn't feel as though 20 years have gone by but I was infact 15 at the time and turn 35 next week so really there's no hiding from it...   Finished off Casandra's tenants place the same week as the News Room followed by a week of no work once again so I finally got round to reading the Da Vinci Code which Rach loaned me a few months back. Was quite a good read- conspiracy theories, a quest, a mythical journey, the occult...took 2 days to complete it and admittedly he's a good author, however, the plot and his writing style was a bit too similar to Anne Rice's Talos or perhaps Tale of a Body Thief... Having been a FOTN fan for years (Fields of the Nephilim/Nefilim) I have a passion for all things related to Fallen Angels, Watchers, Nephilim...and one of the characters in the Da Vinci Code was most certainly fashioned after the watchers, Salis/Silas (can't recall), anyway he was exceptionally tall, an albino with violent tendencies, described as the ghost for his white skin and red eyes shone...My guess would be the author is familiar with the work of Andrew Collins or perhaps an FOTN fan himself :).

       urlLink      Finally got round to registering a domain name on Monday past for my company, most of the site is built but not yet uploaded as I'm still debating which host to go with or if I will be my own server...  Need to invest in some comp upgrades quite badly, if and when I get a rush on of work I'll splurge a bit.   Missed the Strands grand opening bash, completely forgot about it. Hopefully they won't be too offended.

       urlLink       Have been quite busy in rl as of late, some personal issues to deal with...None too pleasant but such is life at times.  Managed to get a few days work in over at Cassandra's, exterior trim work- doors, windows...I find exteriors a bit of a pain as there simply is no means of quality control. Blasted bugs, leaves, debris...blowing onto the fresh paint work, almost seems pointless spending all that time doing a good prep job if the final result isn't up to par.   Matt's place is to be done next, if and when the rain lets up. Guess he has some stripping to be done on the second and third floor windows via the use of a blow torch. Not sure I fancy the work myself, having double jointed elbows makes lifting heavy, bulky things rather difficult especially up ladders whilst trying to support oneself with one arm, holding a propane tank with the same one and using the other to burn off crusty old toxic paint. Yeah, not really my cuppa tea, though I suppose it would be a new skill to add to the resume.  Had a call from Hotsets this past weekend to do some scenic for a commercial and received a call from Rach saying she'd past my name and number on to a key over at NABET as he was looking for a good scenic...unfortunately I was busy digging up my parents yard and laying down a cascading flag stone/crazy paving patio. Bleedin 'ell my thighs, back, wrists, fingers, palms, knees, shoulders...all ache like mad.  Well thats about it. Dosh still trickling in though not much of it and even less film work, though IATSE is supposed to be stompin by the end of August, 3 Features coming in and I have mates positioned as heads on two of them so it's simply a case of playing the waiting game for a whee bit more.
