      Clearly this isn't gonna be a daily thing then...I guess life is just too dull at the mo to write about! :)  Tried getting in touch with Gemma again...but it's the same old story of totally half-arsed/random replies. No doubt she'll text me at 2am tomorrow night again. Women eh?  Work today's been a breeze, the server crashed so it's meant doing pretty much sod all. Shame the net was down too, but everything's&nbsp;fixed this afternoon now and I've got Dad's b-day present sorted (Hitman: Contracts on the Xbox for eighteen squid. Bargain!).  Nowt planned for the weekend...Arsenal on the box versus River Plate this evening, then Ajax on Sunday. All of the big guns are out and there are still rumours of Paddy leaving next week for sunny Spain.  The Amsterdam thing with Prak & Reimondo is in the balance, just waiting on Prakman to get in touch from China. Could do with a break, but fancy somewhere hot and after my last little 'trip' there maybe I'm better off staying at home! :)  Been buying up some CD's and DVD's...Zabiela's Alive on Renaissance is a bit of a masterpiece. Only listened once, but technically and tunes-wise it's stunning. On the film front, The 'Burbs has finally made R2 DVD...sweet! Picked up a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;ponce-films with Emmanuelle Beart starring for obvious reasons. Elephant Juice & Un Couer En Hiver...oh and The Ninth Gate, just for a look at Polanski's missus. Lush ;)  That's pretty much it for now...back to the new office sound system. Bit of Underworld up next. Now we're talking.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Not too much going on today...at least no more grey hairs have showed up (yet!)  Arsenal news is still revolving around Vieira/Campbell and the Trabelsi deal which seems to have collapsed. Think I've sorted my Fantasy Football team for the season...fingers crossed it'll be another £50 won, but crossed even tighter in the hope that I won't be here to collect the winnings in person! If I'm still in this job by next May things will not be looking good.  I'd better get off my arse and start jobhunting properly then hadn't I?! Oxford's still an option (flat share with Blair again) but I'm up for going anywhere really. I need a change...some new people and new places would be good for me I think.  Scored the Goal Of The Century on PES3 last night. Gerd Muller on the volley from 30 yards, first time from a long punt from Lev Yashin. Historic :) (Sad cvnt that I am! Still, it was great!)  Will bring in the old hi-fi tomorrow and have some decent basslines at work at last :)))  That's my lot!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      My ears have just about recovered now...Fabric was wicked. 10pm-7.30am of quality tunes, great atmosphere on an awesome sound system. The main room was totally rammed for Sasha, so we had to take the odd breather, but apart from that it was on the floor all the way. The warm-up DJ, Margaret Dygas was top drawer...dug out some old Tyrant tracks andplayed some mad tech house.   I got a bit lucky with a blonde Aussie school teacher too. Which was nice. Lost her in the crowd after a while but had half an hour of fun all the same :)   My knees are definitely bollocksed though...arthiritic at 24. Fantastic. I'm starting to feel shattered now too. Got back yesterday at 3pm, slept for a couple of hours and then got 6 hours in last night. Overtime at work again this week so it's bound to catch up on me!   Pretty quiet here at work today...Ian (weird goon from the warehouse) is getting stick for bunking off again and it turns out The Rock was&nbsp;sneaking them out&nbsp;at Simon's house in the early hours when he came back over to the visit the other week. Cheeky bastard ran up £20 worth on perve-lines :)   Worst news of the day...Kerri pointed out my first grey hair. Thanks chook. A proper wirey little fecker it was too. Jeezus I'm getting old!   &nbsp;

      Friday afternoon then...nearly out of this place for the weekend!  Got to get the old barnet chopped tonight as for some reason I've not been to the barbers for about 3 months. I look like a cock! Off to fabric tomorrow so it needs fixing :)  My mixing last night was appalling...so out of practice on the decks it's untrue. I'll have another crack later but the signs aren't good. I need to get back into it properly, have loads of good tunes at the mo but without the skills they're going to waste!!!  Today at work was pretty decent actually, me & Kerri had a laugh and chat most of the day. No arguments, and it was nice and chilled! For some reason we get on fine together but when you add other people to the mix it can go right off :0 We figured out that we're definitely very different people so that's probably why we don't always understand what each other's trying to say I think... Loads of people off today and there's nothing much else going on. Won the darts again...what&nbsp;a legend I am, eh?  Also got my prize through from the Silver Planet label competition - a bunch of free records, CD's and stuff that will be soon heading for Ebay ;) The Bill Hicks DVD came thru as well so that'll be a laugh for later.  Heard nowt from Gemma, so I'll take that as Game Over on that one! Strange, strange girl.  Bit of an argument this morning about what my future plans are with Mum...I wish I knew! I'm still as aimless as I was when I was 16. The only things I fancy as a career are hilariously unrealistic... Still, she's right in that if I stay here much longer I'll be 30 before I know it. Scary stuff. I need to find a woman to kick me up the arse about these things!!! As it is, I'm 'happy' (well kind of) to just let things drift...  Will definitely look into getting my driving done soon though. Saved about £700, plus I've got 2 weeks overtime money coming in the next fortnight so I'll be pretty flush for a change :)  That's about it for today then I reckon. Still no news on the Vieira - Real Madrid move, hopefully we'll hang onto him. Old 'Ooh Aah' has&nbsp;signed for Boro. The last of the old school has left Highbury :( Good luck chief!  &nbsp;

      This might just be the best time for me to do this little blog thing...I get an hour on my own upstairs at work each day. Boring as fook, so I'll use it to ramble&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;from now on.  Crappy day at work...it's baking up here in the office and with 4 of us now crammed in it's a bit of a nightmare.  Nick the new bloke seems alright, but he's churning up the same old 'discussions' (AKA arguments) that we've been over a dozen times before. Todays bit of fun revolved around 'what would you do if someone walked up to you and smacked you in the face?'. It's highbrow stuff. The office&nbsp;girls (Kerri & Sarah) maintain that when we've spoken about this before I've said that this sort of thing never happens...  If that was the case&nbsp;I was either winding them up (easily done) or trying to make the point that I don't put myself in that type of situation. For a start, I don't go out in town that much anymore (pissed enough £££ up the wall at uni) and when I do get out it's usually to a chav-free decent club. I'm off to fabric on Saturday for 6 hours of Sasha with my old flatmate Blair and his Oxford mates. Should be quality.  Well, Kerri got in an arse about things (lovely girl, but she's got a real fiery streak in her), and I started to get a wee bit annoyed that their view was 'you're&nbsp;a chickensh!t if you don't fight back'.&nbsp;Tomorrow it's just me and her up here as Sarah's off and Nick'll be working downstairs covering for the spawn of Harry. Usually if it's just the two of us old-timers up here we talk a bit more and don't argue too much. Fingers crossed!  Will try to put a mix together tonight as I've not been hitting the decks too much recently...I think if I can knock out a decent CD I'll try for a gig up at the UEA again. No harm in having a go.  I texted Gemma to see what the deal is with her texting me but as usual didn't get much back...very sulky/babyish reply. Basically she either wants to go out again or not. Simple, no? Silly tart :)  Well, nearly time to go...I actually feel a bit mental doing this as it's similar to talking to yourself! :)

      Right, this'll have to be a quick...got to get set for work in 5 minutes. I've read about these blog things before and thought it might be worth doing. I have so many different things whizzing around in my little brain that it might be worth putting some of them in print!  Will write some more later, but this is basically gonna be about what's going on in my life, women (or lack of them!), mates, my music, football...the usual gub.  Not sure if anyone apart from myself will be reading it, but just in case I'm Mike, I'm 24, a bit of a slacker/dreamer and I'm off to do some work now. Can't wait. More later then...

      Long time no write...not that much going on at the moment.  Very good win and performance against United yesterday in the Charity (Community) Shield. Seems that Vieira will go but the future looks bright judging by the kids yesterday and Jose seems set for a helluva season. Can't wait for Everton on Sunday :)  After Oli from the GU board tipped me off about a £100+ no lose online casino scam a few months back I was kind of hoping he might come up with another one from somewhere. Saturday morning I got news of another loophole meaning you got £200 of free games at Captain Cooks Casino if you deposited £100. All well and good, but my 'free' money was blown inside an hour and according to the small print I have to wager my original ton 10 times before I can withdraw it!!! Not good. Still, I did win £120 on the Ladbrokes thing so nothing's lost overall. But £100 potentially/likely down the pan is hurting!!!!!!! Who knows - I  could  actually win some money? Mugs game innit.  Weather is hot, sweaty & I'm aching  like an old man today. Overtime this week too :( Still, I'll be needing the extra dough!  Mum & Dad got back from Paris (Dad's b-day trip)...sounded like they had a good time. Still hoping on a holiday myself b4 the years end. Might just take a week off work and chill though. Could look for a new job in that time.

      Panic over. Mum just had to rush home at lunch to search for Twiggy (the cat) after she went AWOL this morning. It's hard enough to get her to go out for a wee but she seemed to have vanished off the face of the Earth. Apparently cats 'go off to die' so Mum feared the worst. Where was she? Asleep in the bottom of a wardrobe...little bugger :)  Work's been pretty dull...Kerri came in and was sick, then I started picking up these bad stomach pains too so I've been sat cramped up at the desk for hours. Bloody marvellous.  Ash passed his theory test...good job chief. He's getting the whole driving expereience free on the MOD house. Lucky git...apparently I can get £13 per hour lessons so I'll start up as soon as possible. Need to get my licence!!!  In football, Real have bid £16-£18m for Paddy according to reports. They can stick it. £25m+ and then we'd be talking. Still, who could replace him? It'd be a backwards step to sell one of our big names surely? The ginger ninja has retired from international football. Could have been a legend but to be fair he's been played out of position for the last 3 or 4 years and he's not entirely to blame (is he Sven?, you useless Burns-alike cvnt). Frankie Lampard will be pleased.
