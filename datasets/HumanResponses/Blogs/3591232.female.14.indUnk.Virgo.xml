      yea...i know i haven't written in here for a while becuz i have been typing in my xanga. no offense janelle. well yeah i'm just gonna start talkin about the whole mall with friendz experience that happened on saturday (6-26-04). so me, brie and steph went to the florida mall for this all girl outing. hot topic, gadzooks, spencers, pac sun, OLD NAVY, dillards and SEARS. we were supposed to go home at 6 but instead we went home at like 8. yeah.. we all got good deals when we reached SEARS. there was a 50%- 80% off everything and then take another 30% off!!! we got to sears at 6 where my mom is supposed to pick us up but then she told us about the deal so of course none of us could leave with this huge deal. so we got sum pantz and shirts and tried them on. me and brie got the stuff that we were gonna buy in like 30 minutes but steph got one thing and tried it on, then she got out of the dressing room and got one other thing....gggrrr!!! get like 5 things and then try it on instead of getting things one bye one. it took steph 2 hours to get 1 shirt and 2 pants (and she also got perfume from pac sun). 2 HOURS!! and to make a "ha ha" steph was trying on pairs of pantz and then she got mad and through a pair of pants over the dressing room stall twice...to make it hilarious steph almost hit this one lady that worked at sears TWICE. But yeah that was a great day. we gotta do that again and again and again maybe we should go to festival bay or millenia but i still think the florida mall is better. so yeah... pe@ce out

      Dang man...my day became seriously sucky when i found out that me, brie, and steph couldn't go to the mall 2day GGRRR!!! But oh well my boys julian was there to comfort and talk to me for like......the whole freaking day. "blush" oh yeah i also got my camera hooked up into my comp so if you wanna chat and see me on your computer screen just ask, but....the only catch is that you gotta have Yahoo Messanger, so yeah i'm sry 2 lyke 1/50 of my AIM buddies. Another good thing that happened is that i got to visit my grandma who got a stroke on tuesday. she's made a lot of progress: she can move both sides of her body, move her head, hear everyone's voices, and she can finally keep her eyes open to look at us... the only bad part is that she still can't talk

      Hey pplz, this day has been a pretty good day. I mean like i'm going to the movies with my buds at B&G club and then hopefully my boy Julian will be there watching with us. BUt anywho there has been sum tragic items happening in my lyfe; my lola (grandma) had a stroke on tuesday night, i was balling my eyes out but sshh!!! my parents don't know that i cried my way to sleep that night. and thanx julian for being there (on the phone) that night. The next day I went over to B&G club i was a bit sad but my buds, steph, brie, hernando, juan, and daniel were there to comfort me. They kept my mind off of my grandmother for a while. Later on I went to winn dixie to buy sum flowerz. Suprisingly I saw one of my classmates from school, travis. It was fun talkin to him again becuz i haven't seen him since school ended. But yeah..then at around 5 my family and i went to go and visit my grandmother at the ICU in Osceola Regionl Hosptial. It was so sad to see her just lying there on the hospital bed like a vegetable. But good news is that she can still move and hear, but she can't talk and i overheard the nurse say that her brain was mostly affected. Then i held her hand and said "lola this is Nicole" and then she opened her eyes and then closed back suddenly; tears came out of her eyes. I wanted to cry so badly but i couldn't let my rentz see that i would break down.At 6 (the visiting hours are over) we went to my aunt's house to go ahead and check up on her. When i got in there she handed me a box and a card. The box and card were the presents that my lola was going to give me this saturday when she visited (my lola and aunt always visit on saturdays but they didn't come the past few weeks becuz they went to the Philippines 4 vacation). I hope she will get through these hard times

      wow the weekend is so much better than today. i got bruised while playing kickball, ouch!! but hey i'm alright. Later on came the compass math class...it was gay becuz we had to do work, then i got hit in the head with a bunch of beads and i blame steph and brie for it. but hey i'm still alright. Everything else went okay until we went to games. Hernando i'm sry you got hurt i hope you feel better tomorrow. my freaking teacher believed we were playing a trick on him and then he got hurt. that's crap!! we didn't do nothing of the sort. I hate it when sumone infers sumthing without asking what happened. GGRR!!!Now one of my buds got in trouble becuz she took all the blame even though it was an accident, she said it was an easier way to stop the problem. Danielle...you didn't have to but thanx for being brave!! Now i gotta go becuz there's lightning outside and i don't want my comp to get hit.

      I just got bak 4rom Seaworld. I was fun until sum of our buds got into an arguement. That ruined our trip for like 30 minutes. But all in all we had a great time. Ridin Kraken twice, World Arctic once, and Journey 2 Atlantis once was good. OH MY LORD the craziest thing happened to me when we were about to leave the park. This old couple came up be hind me and brie and tapped me on the shoulder. He asked "r u 4rom Hawaii?" well of course i said "no" becuz i'm filipino all the way!! Then he said "well...with your pretty hair and beautiful eyes i figured that you were probably 4rom there and my wife and i just came back 4rom Honolulu" I said "okay, thanx, and hope you have a good day". Then my buds started saying "nicole just got hit on by a 60 year old man" LMAO that is mad funny, but yet gross at the same time. Anywho i goota go get ready for my aunt's b-day party.

      Hey ya'll i'm goin to  Seaworld. I sorta don't wanna and wanna go...if you catch my drift. I was gonna add my post in the middle of the night but sumthing came up. i'm chattin wit these 2 dudes and then they both start arguing about the whole senior/freshman roles in Gateway. I got tired and sorta mad that they didn't drop the subject. this went on for like about 20 minutes. I had to be the mediator so i dragged them into a chatroom so they can work out their arguements. Finally they dropped the subject and i was able to finally calm down. I went to sleep at like 3 in the morning and woke up at 6 so i don't think i'm ready for Seaworld. peace out ya'll

I'm heading to sports in like 10 minutes and then games right after. Then goes lunch and then we're off to the movies. "Day after 2morrow" or "Harry Potter 3"?

But anyway I gotta go...we swithing over to sports. oh yeah STEPH IS MY BESTEST BUDDY EVA!!!! you happy now steph????

      hey...um...me and julian broke up 2day so yeah...i'm reminiscing throughout all the good times and stuff. i still luv him but hey...what can i do about it? i think i'll be ok after a few days. it will take a while to get used to the new adjustment.  so since this shyt happened i i decided to go back to this site. so yeah i guess i'm just ending this 1st entry with this:  I used to think I loved you but now I know for sure. I will be there forever and I will always be yours. I have changed a lot since we started our relationship. Going through hard times and a lot of crazy shit. But I’m still here, with nothing to fear, just knowing  that you love me gives me tears.  Your parents just don’t understand how it hurts when we’re apart. I still love you to death with all my heart.                                 -JULIAN
