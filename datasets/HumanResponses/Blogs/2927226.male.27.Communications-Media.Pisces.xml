      OK, so turning 27 was no big deal. What made the B-day a little more fun was having my housemate, Joe, celebrate his 26th just two days later (Thursday). Still, I think I'm gonna start a new tradition... I'm gonna start taking off work on my birthday so I can enjoy the day however  I  want -- whether it's sleep in 'til noon or assemble a scrapbook or drive to Philly for a cheesesteak.  In my mind, birthdays should be special in the way you want them to be.... if you want to work and ignore them, fine. But if you want to have the day to yourself, more power to you.

       urlLink From the pages of the Delaware State News....   Uh, yeah. This is the fun stuff I get to write about.... seriously! How could you not laugh after reading this? I had a good chuckle with the state police spokesman, picturing some good ol' boy pulling up in front of the police station and walking inside and proclaiming, "I've got a car full of hand grenades. Who wants 'em?"   What a dummy. Who sits there and collects 32 hand grenades and then drives them to the police??? Um hello? 911, can I frickin' help you? Had one of the live grenades gone off and this guy had died, I'd have the winner for the 2004 Darwin Awards locked up already. But alas, this idiot probably went home and procreated.   Shit.

      Welcome to my latest creation.... my very own Blog! I plan to post several musings on my favorite subjects -- baseball, music, wrestling and life in general -- as well as an account of my career as a reporter. Believe me, some interesting things happen in my office and on my beat.  And so,  on with the show!

      Two words:  Dover Downs .  Those words mean nothing to you unless you: A) Like to lose money to one-armed bandits, or B) L-O-V-E NASCAR. The Downs is part casino, part hotel, part international speedway. Two major NASCAR races are hosted here each year, which draws 150,000 rednecks and thousands of RVs to Dover (and thus lowering the IQ of the state by 30 points) and rakes in about $95 million in revenue for associated businesses. While I HATE NASCAR with a passion, I have to respect the fact that I live in a town that actually has a guaranteed tourist draw outside of its history.  As for the casino, it's just video slots, but who knows? I might strike it rich someday! :-P Either way, Dover Downs is contributing to society (albeit by producing more broke, drunk rednecks, but you've gotta start somewhere).

       urlLink A perfect example of why I can't live in a town right out of "Deliverance"   So, two candidates for Frederica Town Council are running for office with the understanding that if they are elected, they could nix the town's two-officer police force -- a violation of the town's charter. Great idea! Why don't we turn off the water and reinstitute a central well for the town? And bring back the town crier!  "Stupidity" doesn't begin to describe this pair. I'm certainly curious to see if they get elected, which would prove my theory about elections -- the idiots always outnumber the educated.  Even better than their campaign platform is the hand-written flyer they apparently are circulating around town, which reads, "We stand for honesty,  integrator , and with the support  from  the community. We want to make a  different  for the town."  I might make mistakes when writing, but if you're going to hand out flyers while running for mayor (even if it is a hamlet of 650 in the middle of Podunk), you might want to double-check the spelling first. *sigh* Now how do I follow that up with a "Why I like living in Dover" post? :-/

      Welcome back to Delaware Revisionist History 101. I'm your unbelievably young professor, Dr. Drew. :)  Today we take a break from 300-year-old history... I simply don't want to put you to sleep!  Why is Dover cool and unique? We have  Dover Air Force Base , a major military installation in the US. How important is it? Well, during WWII, Hitler had two targets circled on his map of the US: 1) Washington DC (duh) and 2) Dover Air Force Base. The base is a major cargo transport base, shipping military supplies to all over the world via the C-5 Galaxy, the largest plane in the US Air Force. The damn thing's cargo bay is one foot longer than the Wright Brothers' entire first flight!  Also, Dover AFB is home to the only port mortuary in the US. When soldiers die in action (Vietnam, Iraq, the Pentagon victims from Sept. 11), their remains come here for identification and preparation for a military burial. It was a pretty chilling moment on Sept. 12, 2001, when you could hear and then see Chinook helicopters flying right over your head toward the base, and you knew what was inside.

      The joke has been out there for a while now, especially among my friends who have (briefly) visited Dover -- Why would you live in a town like Dover? What the hell possessed you to move to the boonies instead of a blossoming metropolis?  Well, let me try to respond in a series of posts.   First, let me offer a  point  before I go into my  counterpoint .... Dover  is  a semi-boring town. There is almost nothing for anyone between the ages of 21-35 on a regular basis -- no concerts, no real nightclubs, not even a real coffee shop to veg out in. The stores in downtown Dover close at 6pm on weeknights and before 5pm on weekends. For a city with two legitimate undergrad colleges, there is very little for students to do, and even less for poor 20-somethings to find. Hence the reason I venture to Newark or take to the roads on weekends.  However, Dover is interesting if nothing else because it is the state capital. It's a 300-year-old city (once you get past the Appalachians, there aren't too many of them) with a great deal of history....  Today's lesson:  Caesar Rodney , a Dover resident and former governor (or president) of Delaware. Rodney, as the story goes, rode 80 miles from Dover to Philadelphia in 1776 to cast the tie-breaking vote among Delaware's three-man delegation in favor of the Declaration of Independence. His historic ride and vote gave the Continental Congress a unanimous vote among the 13 colonies for independence, and the rest, as they say, is history.

      It was a fun little sight to behold, one that I couldn't resist commenting on...  From Tuesday's Delaware State News... (read the entire article  urlLink here ) "The newly elected councilman rebuffed Mayor Schaeffer's attempt to congratulate him after the results were announced, sidestepping him to talk to reporters."  Patrick Cahill does not like his neighbor one bit, and the newest member of council happens to live next door to the mayor. Fun stuff. The mayor, it seems, was out to get him last September when an ordinance came through that would have forced Cahill to remove his sailboat, which ironically was stored in the side yard next to the mayor's house. It wasn't pretty last year, but the context made tonight's snuff well worth it.  The mayor came up to shake his hand and said, "Congratulations and good luck on your upcoming term," to which Cahill responded, "Yeah right," and moved over to talk to us. Pretty funny stuff, if you ask me. All I could picture was Fonzie doing the "Aaaayy!" while pulling his hand back and running it along the side of his hair. Smooooooth.

      Well, the big Dover  urlLink election  has come and gone, and the youngest of the six candidates won. Speed managed to steer clear of the personal politics that surfaced during this campaign, and it's my guess that it helped propel him to victory.  The funniest thing about the election is Friedman, who raised $11,000 and garnered only 539 votes (out of 4,605 cast). That's $1,000 per percentage point or $20.51 per vote. Horrible, especially for a $45,000 a year job. Don't think I won't have a story on this soon.  The downside is that now that the election is done, I won't have my favorite topic to occupy my time. I actually have to be a reporter and dig for stories again! Dammit!

      Not everything I write is negative... check out  urlLink this heroic tale  of three men (one in particular) who pulled a 76-year-old man from a submerged car. Sometimes people do great things, and sometimes they happen to have greatness thrust upon them. In this case, one guy made a wrong turn and was thrust into the hero's role. Hats off to this guy for his efforts!  His  "Things to do" list  must have looked funny... Wednesday - Buy groceries Thursday - Get lost on way to Justice of the Peace, save guy from sinking truck Friday - Get married Saturday - Honeymoon  This type of story is a great reason why I love reporting. Being at the scene of a horrible accident surrounded by police and firefighters talking about the grim situation..... and then there's a happy ending. See? It's not all doom and gloom.

      Yeah, it's not exactly the millions that bigger campaigns throw around, but for a city of 33,000, raising  urlLink a dollar a resident  between five guys seems silly to me. Sign of the times, I guess. Whoops! the sign just got stolen!  Fuck!

       urlLink Just desserts or sour grapes? You decide....   Well, it looks like the police and the victimized candidate went through with it and pressed charges against our friend for allegedly stealing his $8 campaign sign. Local political experts have said this could hurt his chances to win, but could hurt the victim too. You think???? Pressing charges for $8 seems a  little   harsh to me, but if he's truly on a crusade for what is right and fair, good luck. This shit happens all the time... I just think this is the first time a candidate actually was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.  And now, with all these food references, I'm off to the kitchen. :-P

       urlLink A new method of campaigning....   I don't even know where to start with this one.... If it's true, this guy has to be the dumbest candidate on God's green Earth. I've heard the expression, "There's no such thing as bad press," but I'm telling you, any way you slice it,  this  is  bad press . There's no doubt in my mind that if he's arrested, he's done. Toast. Say what you want about voters being dumb and not caring about stuff like this.... stealing your opponents signs (and getting caught red-handed by said candidate) is, well, pretty damn stupid.  At least pay a kid $10 to tear up a few signs for you.

      Sometimes, my job is the most difficult thing in the world. I can't get a story to come together to save my life. I sweat, groan, pace and bite my nails over the lead (first sentence) and how to craft the piece. Somehow, I know it all will work out, but it's getting to that point that's damn near impossible.  But sometimes, things fall into place in such an amazing way that the story just writes itself. Observe today's  urlLink hot story  from the State News.... this damn thing was  too much fun  to write!  After the past week that I've had (professionally and personally), this is exactly the type of story I needed. I have struggled to write what I consider an engaging story for a little while, but this one was perfect. Any time I can get mayoral candidates squabbling like 8-year-olds on the playground, I'm there.

      So I had the opportunity this past weekend to do community service for the first time in several years.... and it was such a great rush! I can't explain it. Picking up trash alongside a road seems oh so simple and such a nondescript service (any functional human can do it), but at the same time, it was a great departure from years of "inactivity."  It's not that I haven't participated in service projects since graduating, but most of them have been "big events" like charity sports tournaments and such. I can't describe how much fun it was to lie down in dirt to get stuff out of a ditch or even straddle the ditch to pull hubcaps, used condoms and  do-it-yourself catheters  out of the ditch. Yeah!

      Just so you don't think I've been completely negligent, here's  urlLink a little fun  from last week's Delaware State News.... the top half is the fun stuff.  It's been a while, and I'm sure I missed a couple great stories to get up on the blog, but this is a great example of small-town politics. Such fun. I'm gonna miss this when I eventually move to a bigger paper.

      Check out this  urlLink great little story  about my favorite law enforcement agency, the Frederica Police Department. Just imagine if Boss Hogg wanted to fire Sheriff Roscoe P. Coletrane....  Good god, I can't even make a joke about it. I feel bad for the chief, who comprises half of the town's police force. He's just trying to do his job and the mayor is all about giving him the boot. Now you know why I don't want to move to tiny hamlets like this.

      There are so many World War II stories that have never been told, and every day, there are less stories that can be told. More than 1,000 WWII vets die each day and most of the surviving vets are in their late 70s or 80s. Check out this  urlLink State News story  I wrote a couple weeks ago about one Delaware veteran who was lucky enough to survive being shot (a Purple Heart recipient) and attended the dedication of the WWII memorial in Washington.  My grandfather, like many of yours, was a WWII vet. He answered the call bravely and served without hesitation. So many of us take it for granted, but this being the 60th anniversary of D-Day, I decided to talk to my Pop-Pop about the experiences he almost never mentioned.  Firstly, I found it ironic that he was 27 during D-Day (the same age as me) and he suffered from a similar problem that affects me (a bad back), yet there he was, fighting in Europe to stop Hitler's army from marching toward world domination (it almost sounds like a James Bond plot). My grandfather drove a radio truck for an engineering unit that rebuilt bridges so Allies' vehicles could continue through Europe. When I asked him on Memorial Day about the war, he sidestepped many details, stating that he "didn't like to recall most of it." He said he put a great deal of the war out of his mind. However, he did share with me that he was hospitalized due to his back shortly before D-Day and missed the landing. It turned out that his injury was a godsend in some ways -- most of his unit was wiped out during the invasion.  While it's not a heroic tale similar to that of my friend in the news story, I'm still in awe of what he and many like him accomplished 60 years ago. There's no other way to say it than simply, "Thank you."

      For the purposes of understanding the lingo here, go watch  urlLink "Mean Girls" &nbsp;first.....  This weekend, Evan and I experienced movie reality in action at a good friend's party in DC. While at "Ben Bash VI" (cheap plug!), we met several girls who participate in Ben's adult kickball league (he's the area president). Most of the girls in question were nearly drop-dead gorgeous. Just sick. Let's leave it at that and move along with this little life lesson.  The girls typified the Plastics from "Mean Girls." They were beautiful, popular and&nbsp;dressed in tight, revealing clothes (one girl was wearing a camisole, which I'm told is the all-new rage in fashion -- lingerie worn on the outside). I'm not complaining about their appearance, but substance, that's a different story. I started conversations with two of them during the evening (just idle chit-chat, I wasn't looking for anything), and got the all-too-traditional blowoff of "I'm going to get a beer,  I'll be right back ."  It wasn't the blowoffs that was frustrating. It was seeing how they were only interested in each other and blew off nearly everyone else at the party. They were they're own clique (complete with a few a guys who came with them). They ditched the party at the same time, basically claiming that the party was leaving  with  them. There was an air about them that was palpable. Everyone felt it. Just a disappointing realization.  The lesson (if there really is one to learn here) is the well-known adage that beauty is only skin deep. Beautiful girls aren't always the most desirable. Yes, they're fun to look at (and they're clearly advertising their bodies when they were painted-on jeans and lingerie), but that doesn't make them the best girls out there. See ladies? It's not just girls who are looking for a "nice" person.

      I've been reporting this story for the past week, and it's been an emotional tale here in Delaware.... a state trooper on patrol was killed by a drunk driver who was racing north in the southbound lanes of the highway. This was a 31-year-old corporal who was the father of two and regarded as a dedicated family man.  Now, the almost-depressing twist: the driver of the other car had a  urlLink .336 blood alcohol level , more than four times the legal limit in DE. According to the state medical examiner, people with a BAC that high could be in&nbsp;a complete stupor and even suffer an alcohol-induced coma.  One of my paper's copy editors said it best: .336 is great, if we were talking batting average. But blood alcohol level? That's horrible. I really can't say anything else about it. Just read the story.

      Well, this past weekend has come and gone, and what a weekend it was! Let me see if I can do Grand Chapter 2004 justice....  The conference itself rocked, mainly due to an expertly assembled agenda arranged by Tammy and Ben  and  a wonderful group of delegates who had a great sense of humor but still were respectful enough to get shit done in record time.  As for being National Secretary, it's kinda bittersweet... I'm going to miss roll calls at GC (mainly laughing so hard that I have to put my head on the podium), making important decisions and learning how to challenge myself to think critically. But it's a choice I  had  to make. I don't know where I will be in a year (reporting carries people to different locales every few years) and I needed time to get my young, professional and personal life in order.  One thing I  have  to address.... Saturday night at the Capital Ale House. Never in my life have I been the center of attention like that, especially by girls. I'm not used to having girls approach me and ask to kiss me  or  just start licking my face. Very weird. Not something I would like to happen every weekend, but one time in my life was enough. After reflecting on it for a few days, I consider it one of those experiences that I should tuck away in my memory because: 1) It was a damn good memory, 2) It was like a dream come true, and 3) No way in  hell  it'll happen again unless I win the lottery.&nbsp; :-P  Lastly, and most sentimentally, I really did get choked up during officer changeover. That was the first time since I stepped down as VP of Alpha Eta and moved to Historian (lost a race for chapter secretary -- can you believe it? -- and parliamentarian). I teared up then because many of my closest friends were graduating.  But Sunday, reality sunk in, not that all seven of us were leaving Council, but that I had  been  on Council for the past two years! You sometimes get caught up in the moment and don't even realize where you are. That's how I felt at times. I  knew  I was on Council, but that had just become part of who I was for two years. Sunday, that part of me was fading away, and I truly am going to miss it.

      John Cougar Mellencamp surely couldn't have meant  urlLink Cheswold  when he penned his hit song. This is exactly the reason why I can't move to a town with less people living in it than my high school (1000) or hell, even UD (14,000 at the time).  Small towns breed small mentality. It's an amazing phenomenon. Education, world views, culture, sophistication.... it all seems to diminish as the town's population shrinks. I work in Dover, a city of 33,000 and the capital of Delaware. People wear suits to work and to council meetings. There are art galleries, department stores, a performing arts center, hotels, law offices and a general feeling that you can live here and be fulfilled.  Then you have Cheswold.... a tiny hamlet of 300. Town Hall is a house that doubles as police headquarters. Council meetings are held in the equivalent of the dining room with two six-foot tables set up in an "L" serving as the dais. I'm not going to bash the town because that's not my job. What I've described is factual. The opportunities to expand your horizons within town limits are miniscule.  *sigh* Dover might not be the Mecca of Life, but at least something is going on here. There's something to do other than hang out at the fire house and drink beer (we have bars for that!). Maybe the move to DC will open some more doors for me. Who knows?

      Proof that I still can write  urlLink a nice, touching story  about a person overcoming a hardship....  Ironically, Councilman Salters had the same type of surgery that I did, so we've bonded over that. Remarkably, he had his surgery 60 years later in life than me (I was 15 when I had my spinal surgery). Knowing how tough and painful recovery and just  life  can be after this surgery, I'm crossing my fingers for him.  Maybe sometime I'll document some of the crap I've gone through as a result of my back surgery (pain, recovery, limitations, etc.) Thoughts?

      Ah, the weekend that was.... I remember it as if it was yesterday (ummm, jackass, half of the weekend  was  just yesterday).... Yeah, anyway.... Seriously, just a great weekend that was highlighted by a lot of quality time with close friends from UD and PSP.  Friday night, I took off from work to Dewey Beach for some routine debauchery at the bars.... I joined forces with some beach-house roommates of J-Ro (my housemate and co-worker) and we hit up the Bottle & Cork for the Pat McGee Band concert (Joe didn't want to see them since he went to VCU in Richmond and they're from there). We had a good old time, came back to the house and I crashed there, capping off a steam-blowing night.  Saturday was all about spending time with long-lost friends. Lunch and hanging out with Michele (the Big) in Rehoboth started the day and it ended in Dover with Dave and Emily (who got  engaged  recently) and Jason, Summer and Rebecca at Smithers (ah, the old crash pad).  And lastly, today was the BBQ in DC at Joe and Ashley's new house. Lots of old schoolers there and lots of fun stories shared. Matt put his new squeeze to the test, feeding her to the wolves (us) for an afternoon. She gets a passing grade for now, but it's an "Incomplete" until she survives and entire weekend. (Dan's Katie passed this trial last year at the beach with flying colors, and we don't bite!)   Weekend lessons:     - Emily is funny as shit. No lie. I hadn't hung with her in a long time and forgot.   - I shoulda taken pics of Joe and Ash's new house before they start redecorating. It's day and night after they start tearing through a place -- paint, shelves, decorations, etc. They should quit their day jobs and remodel homes together.... they could have their own show!   - Dewey is the greatest place on Earth and Joe's beach house is heaven. Imagine 20+ 20-somethings all congregating in a house full of couches and air mattresses, enough liquor to stock a bar  and  a keg-erator. With bars every half-block, thousands of other singles moseying throughout the down and everyone drunk and looking to enjoy the summer, I'll leave it up to you to fill in your own blanks. The bottom line: if you haven't been to Dewey, you're missing out.
