      Life since last two months is tough, damn the rule that says cut "very," I need the word to describe my situation: it is very tough. Reason is my bathroom. Two months ago, the hard-to-catch sound in our bathroom turned out to be a water leak. The apartment complex's complex plumbers came and "plumbed" the bathtub out, with toilet seat sitting on drawing room's carpet, driving my Korean friend so indignant (We Koreans don't shit, know that?) that I had to say a few blunt things, and, well, my Korean friend seems to have defected to North Korea since. After one of the dirtiest, and darkest, also dorkiest, existence in my life history, our bathroom became whole again (after two days or so), but hot water refused to come. Cold baths everyday soon gave me cold.    One afternoon, I went to the leasing office, ostensibly to give them "a piece of my mind." The little fella, who is grey-haired and "tough" apartment manager, gave me the sweetest, the stinkiest, and the seldomest (I just coined it, Okay?) spanking (verbal only). I fought back with reason, reeling under the repeated stabs from his insolent tongue, but I have read Gandhi and Christ too closely to kick the knave. Then began a brazen display of autocracy. All kinds of crazy and "spent-up" people walking into our house and putting ears to bathroom wall and floor. The littel fella accused me of being uneducated (I forgot to ask him what the capital of Canada was). The fella said that I should have had the sense to report the leak earlier, judging from the sound in my bathroom, before--he mentioned a few thousand gallons--half of Lake Mead flowed out of the pipe. I replied that I lived in a place where one heard many sounds, including those of ghosts, but the fella said that he was too too busy, and that he should not be wasting his screwed-up life over a harassed nincompoop like me.   Since then I have become paranoid and, sometimes, I imagine the fella sending people out again to dig up my bathroom, refusing even to give me an alternate bathroom, so, unable to urinate, I may die of some kind of urine leak! My fear proved right when fella sent a felli yesterday (sounds feminine? then it's fine) to "request" my permission to rape my bathroom again. Generously, Fella ran inside his office and returned with a key for apartment 127, so if I wanted to shit in the middle of the night, I'd have to walk past 10 houses to this place to shit in darkness, fearing that, anytime, fella's fellows might decide to report me as a housebreaker. I left this morning with good news. One and the only one sensible worker in this Leasing Office told me, pleasantly, that my bathroom was to be reborn today, that one in-house plumber, who had been living in the US for the past 27 years but spoke worse English than a Bhutanese, was fired because he had botched up the work in my house: bathroom casualty.   I added "high" to the title of this blog, because the summer class I am teaching is going well. I prepare for the class as a lawyer prepares for a hearing.

      Who does not have them? Yet when you're having one of them, it feels so bad you want to give up on everything and see a demon in every person you meet. Well, today was one such day for me. Early on, I got the indications. A verbal duel with my wife who is good at it. Not that I am much different. The worst part came in the library where I sat on a sofa, a chair, and a toilet seat, trying to make sense of a few sentences. After a grueling, emasculating five hours,the result was two and a half page worth of editing that will pass through my eyes tomorrow again. All right, let me write about what was good today. I read on rediff.com an interview with Lt. Gen. Brar who talked about the famous (for me it is famous) Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. I wrote a three-line comment and the same was put up on the site by evening. It was satisfying to read my words in print--words that mean to me the world. At about 9 p.m. Suhas and Pradnya came over. We had pizzas together. They are a nice couple. Meeta enjoyed her Jalapeno-topped pizza. Then, after our neighboring couple went back, I tried to sleep but was not successful. I decided to proofread Suhas' thesis so that I could work on my things tomorrow. I completed it. That's good. Just before going to bed I wanted to look at my name on a case study I wrote with Kelle that is now a part of UNLV's Business Writing textbook. It was so satisfying, that one look. I want to write another case, with Heather Lusty. Her idea, sent by her father, is good, too. At last, when I was about to  disconnect the net and shut my laptop down, I remembered that I hadn't "blogged" today, so all these words. I love words. I hope my love is reciprocated. Tomorrow.

      So Perry began yet another thing for me. This "blog" thing. I have always wanted to write diaries, even before I decided to be a writer. But our actions, not intentions, decide who we are, and my wish remained unfulfilled until today when I started this. Thanks to Perry. I have titled this collection, and I will make this a collection, "Living in Vegas." Why? Because you doubt if you ever live in Vegas. It's such a quiet, business-like city, don't get taken in by the strip? I have been living here for the past 18+ months and liked the place despite some not-so-likeable experiences. Let me tell you what I like about Vegas.  1. I like its down-to-earth, keep-minding-your-business attitude 2. UNLV, of course 3. MFA program 4. Lied Library 5. Writing Center 6. UNLV campus 7. UNLV Bookstore 8. Flamingo - Albertsons - which is where we get our groceries from 9. The desert climate and landscape 10. People in general - they seem to be more accepting of foreigners 11. The sky 12. Birds - I don't know them yet. I wish to know about them. Wish had an ornithologist as a friend. I could take five walks with him a day. 13. For some sentimental reason, I like Sierra Vista Drive, the street where I first lived after coming here. 14. My humble achievements - among them, a co-authored business writing case, a possible novel  More tomorrow.
