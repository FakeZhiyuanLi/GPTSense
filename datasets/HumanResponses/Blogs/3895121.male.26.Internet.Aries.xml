      One of my good friends at work was officially terminated yesterday. I mean she didn't show up to work for almost last two weeks and didn't call or return calls from work.   When our new manager started work, we all hated her. Some of us still do (I am in that group). My friend and I made a bet at that time about who will be fired first - her or me?   So Yesterday I lost the bet.&nbsp; She was really a fun person. We used to go out for lunches and stuff. She was a kid just 19 years old. I think now she is going back to school. May the force be with her.   I will call her sometime so she can come and get her wager. but wait, we didn't decide on the money.   I'll miss her.

      A special friend visited me today at my place. It was short sweet visit. She was going to her relative's place and decided to come here even though she had to go 100 miles out of way to see me. This is the second time she visited me.   We were dating each other about 3 years ago and then broke up with a mutual understanding. She has been a very caring and understanding friend. I can talk to her for hours and I can share anything (well almost everything) with her. We have been talking for hours everynight for last 2 months (which probably is why I can't go to Gym in the mornings).   Anyways, we have this special something going on between us. We both know it and feel it. Actually we have even talked about it. I like this girl and she has most of the qualities which I am looking for in a girl, who I will marry. But I will not do anything about it because of her family. She has an elder sister and I have seen the family interfering in the sitster's married life so much which I or my family would be able to stand.  &nbsp; I have so much to talk about this girl. I will continue this post later.

      Went clubbin last night. returned at 3:30 this morning and slept until noon. I don't know why I go to clubs. Spent atleast $50 dollars on beer/cover charges/parking. I don't dance. I don't ask girls for thier phone numbers. I just go ther to hang out with friends. I need to stop doing something I really do not enjoy. Maybe I need some new friends which enjoy doing what I like. But I menally feel I am too old to make new friends. Just Kidding. I just don't know where to meet new friends. What to do.   In the afternoon I started studying for the new project starting this week at work. I have two meetings planned for tomm morning which I have to head since I will be lead person on this project and I have no clue on what I will talk about. I will start studying again in a little bit.

      I signed up for 24 Hour Fitness Gym last week (7 days ago). I haven't gone there once. Shelled out $150 and $26 per month auto deduction from my credit card.   I don't know what's wrong with me. Is it that I don't have a commitment to go to gym daily or is it I have so many other things in life that this is not a priority?

      Major changes at work scene. Thing not working out with the new manager and some serious addition to my job role. The new job responsibilities can only be justified by doubling my salary but I donâ€™t expect that to happen. I have annual review coming up in september. Let's keep our fingers crossed.
