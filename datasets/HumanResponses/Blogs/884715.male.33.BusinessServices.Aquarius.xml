       urlLink  From USA Today      By Dan Vergano, USA TODAY  Hollywood, the modern muse, has brought the Bronze Age to the silver screen. Troy, based on the early epics of western civilization, The Iliad and The Odyssey, tells of a Greek siege of the ancient city of Troy. The movie echoes the tales composed by the Greek poet Homer in about 750 B.C., but it doesn't follow them exactly.  In the movie, as in The Iliad, the Greeks attack Troy to retrieve Helen, the wife of the king of Sparta. She has run off with Paris, a prince of Troy. But Achilles, the Greeks' best warrior, stops fighting after he is insulted by Agamemnon, the Greek king of kings. The Trojans begin to destroy the Greeks. The tide turns against them, however, when the death of a close comrade brings Achilles back to the Greek side.  Using The Odyssey, the movie's tale continues, relating the story of the Trojan horse. The Greeks pretend to sail away, leaving a giant wooden horse as an offering to the gods. Elated, the Trojans bring the horse into the city, hoping that the gods will credit them with the offering. That night, Greek soldiers hiding in the horse climb out, taking their sleeping enemies by surprise.  Clearly the filmmakers have taken some liberties. But how much is real about the legend itself, which acquired the patina of history in early Greek and Roman societies? USA TODAY's Dan Vergano talks to classics experts, archaeologists and scholars to find out.   Was Troy Real?   In 1871, a German businessman named Heinrich Schliemann began excavating a 5-acre mound in Turkey called Hisarlik that he later reported was Homer's "mighty-walled Troy." Now under excavation by the Project Troia team led by Germany's University of Tubingen and the University of Cincinnati, the mound overlooks the Dardanelles straits linking the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, matching Homer's descriptions.  Homer called the city both Ilios and Troia. In Latin, the Romans called the site Trojanus, which in English has been shortened to Troy.  "Probably most archaeologists would say, yes, Hisarlik was Troy," says archaeologist Christopher Ratte of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. Excavators have found layered remains of at least 10 past settlements at Hisarlik dating from 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1300.   The sixth-level city is believed to be the Troy described in The Iliad. Excavations in the 1990s found that a harbor and large city surrounded the hilltop citadel. "The upshot is that Troy was very wealthy," says archaeologist Eric Cline of George Washington University, which would make it a prize.   "Clearly the seeds of the Troy saga are there," says Kristin Romey of Archaeology magazine, which has a Troy retrospective in its current issue. The city is now seen by scholars as a tributary colony of the Hittites, who ruled Turkey at the time, rather than the Greek city depicted by Homer.    Was There a Trojan War?   "I wouldn't be surprised if there was a war or many wars fought over Troy between two empires, Greek and Hittite," Cline says. "Troy was a plum ripe for picking."   The Project Troia team has reported finding heaps of sling bullets, evidence of burning and signs of an earthquake in Hisarlik's sixth settlement, which appears to have been destroyed around 1275 B.C.   Hittite records suggest the Greeks may have warred over the city as early as 1400 B.C. Bronze swords of Greek manufacture from the spoils of war have turned up at the site of the Hittite capital.  "Homer was likely telescoping 200 years of conflict into a single 10-year war," Cline says. Homer lived centuries after the time of the Trojan War, but some descriptions of combat in The Iliad match conditions from the earlier time. In The Iliad, warriors wear helmets covered with boar's tusk and settle battles with single combat, one chariot-riding warrior against another, practices out of fashion in Homer's day.    Was There a Trojan Horse?   "Even in classical antiquity, the authors of stories regarding the Trojan War had doubts about the original existence of the colossal wooden horse," says Brian Rose of the University of Cincinnati, co-director of Project Troia. No archaeological evidence exists of an oversized wooden horse there. Instead, the horse is seen as an allegory for other, less dramatic endings to the war:  • In Homer's time, the Assyrian Empire had mastered the use of siege engines to batter down walls of cities. The Trojan horse may be simply a poet's description of siege warfare, Ratte suggests.  • Sieges often bring disease. The Trojan horse story may hide the transmission of a disease from Greek invaders to Trojan defenders that ravaged both sides and left the city defenseless.  • Horses were a totem animal of Poseidon, the god of earthquakes. The Trojan horse may be a metaphor for a quake that decimated the wealthy city, leaving it prey for Greek pirates.   Was There an Achilles or Helen?   "Is Homer history?" asks Frederic Winter, a classics scholar formerly with City University of New York. "Well, wars have been fought for dumber reasons, and wars have lasted longer than 10 years. But we have no archaeological evidence of one woman running away and starting a war there."  "We have no evidence that there ever was an Achilles or a Helen," Rose says. But he notes that in one Hittite text there is a reference to Aleksandus, ruler of Wilusa — the Hittite name for a kingdom where Hisarlik now stands. Aleksandus may be a modified form of Alexander, which is another name for Paris. Some interpret this text as referring to Paris, ruler of Troy, in the late Bronze Age.   Most likely, Winter says, Homer was telling his clients, who lived in a greedy world of fractious city-states, a story of "the good old days" when the Greeks united under one banner to fight for honor.  "It all seems a little implausible," Cline says. "Honor may have been the excuse for a war they would have fought anyway."

       urlLink  From the BBC   By Martin Hutchinson   For plenty of cinema-goers, the prospect of seeing Brad Pitt as a loincloth-clad hero is enough to encourage them to see the film, which opens in the UK on Friday. But many others will want to know whether there is any truth in it all. Did Troy exist?   Its makers Warner Bros are no doubt hopeful that their latest sword and sandal epic will bring home the Oscars as Gladiator did in 2001.   The "book of the film" is The Iliad, reputedly written in 800BC by the blind Greek poet Homer.   Modern culture is still familiar with the tale. "The face which launched a thousand ships" is a well-known quote referring to Helen, the beauty at the centre of the story.   And any football fan knows the significance of an injury to the Achilles tendon, referring to the warrior hero with a fatal weakness.   Even computer users recognise a "Trojan horse" as something dangerous, if not to life and limb, at least to their PC, referring as it does to the crafty subterfuge which enabled the penetration of Troy.   The story appears to have everything - a 10-year conflict between mighty nations and their warrior heroes, triggered by the abduction of Helen of Troy - the most beautiful woman in the world.   But Professor Brian Rose, an archaeologist from the University of Cincinnati, has been trying to separate fact from this fiction for decades.   He says the Troy legend is as relevant today as it was to the ancient Greeks.   "Look at the story - it talks about a coalition of forces heading off to fight in the East, a conflict between East and West. Who would not recognise that today?"   For centuries experts have pored over Homer's description of this lofty, heavily fortified city and attempted to put it on the modern map.   The text seemed to place it by the side of the Dardanelles - the straits between the Aegean and Black seas. It is difficult to imagine a more strategically-important spot in terms of trade.   In 1870, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann began excavating a mound at Hisarlik, a few kilometres from the Dardanelles. He found remains of a substantial ancient settlement.   In fact, closer examination of the site revealed not just one city - but several, built one on top of the other. The deeper you dug, the further back in time you travelled, right back to 4,500 BC.   So was one of them Homer's Troy? While there is no obvious cause for the abandonment and rebuilding of some of the cities, there is clear evidence of a violent end to others.   In particular, one caught the eye of researchers. Dating roughly from 1200 BC, this city bore all the hallmarks of having been destroyed by an invading army.   Professor Rose said: "What we found was a five-foot 'destruction level' with evidence of burning, bones, and piles of stones for slingshots - it is consistent with a sack of the city."   A recent study by University of Delaware geologists of sediments in the flood plain beside the city, suggests many of the battlefield details of Homer's Iliad may have been close to the truth as well.   Many archaeologists now believe that there was indeed a war, or perhaps several wars between Greeks and "Trojans" - most likely the western end of the huge Hittite empire which then dominated what is now Turkey.   What they really needed to prove that this indeed was Troy was some written evidence from the time that might suggest a conflict, and virtually none has ever been found.   However, when fragments of Hittite writings from this era were unearthed, they offered some tantalising clues.   They spoke of a dispute in the West at this time, and described a city whose name was similar to Ilion - a later name given to Troy.   No document from the period has ever mentioned a Helen of Troy, or an Achilles, but these writings mention an individual called Alexandros - an alternative version of the name Paris.   While Paris may have been a real person, it remains doubtful that his city descended into war over his desire for Helen - the strategic position of Troy on the main trade routes between East and West is a far more likely explanation.    Wooden Horse   Professor Rose said: "If a war was fought over Troy, it was much more likely to be for money and power rather than love."   Even the existence of the famous wooden horse - one of the highlights of the movie - is in doubt. No trace of it has ever been found by archaeologists.   Homer's epic was the blockbuster of its time, and it is possible that in a different age - eyesight permitting - he might have been a cinema scriptwriter himself, hyping up the battles and bringing in the love interest.   Audiences experiencing his stories for the first time this summer may be seeing a little more truth than in the average Hollywood potboiler.

       urlLink  From the BBC     A coin that solved the mystery of a little-known Roman emperor is going on display at a new exhibition.       The bronze coin, that bears the face of Emperor Domitianus was found by Brian Malin as he combed a field in Oxfordshire with a metal detector.   Only one other such coin exists, showing the face of the man who ruled Britain for just four days, but was dismissed as a hoax.   Mr Malin's coin is on exhibition at the British Museum in London.   Experts say his discovery proves the earlier coin, found in France 100 years ago, was genuine and that Domitianus did exist.   The coin, estimated to be worth more than £10,000, goes on display on Wednesday at the British Museum in London.   Historians believe Domitianus was the penultimate Roman ruler in Britain, an upstart from the legion who was ousted for treason for daring to declare himself emperor and having the coins made.   Mr Malin, a father of one who has been searching for treasure with his metal detector for more than 15 years, found the coin in a field in April last year, 10 miles south-east of Oxford.   It was in a pot of 5,000 others, stuck together and also bearing the heads of emperors.   Dating from 250AD to about 275AD, they spanned five emperors and a time of great upheaval for the Roman Empire.   Richard Abdy, Roman coin curator at the British Museum, said: "The Roman empire was beginning to fray. Domitianus, it looks, ruled in 271AD, he was the penultimate emperor and there was only one coin with his image.   "There have been references to Domitianus in two ancient texts but they described him as an officer who had been punished for treason."   Dr Chris Howgego, curator for Roman coins at the Ashmolean Museum, said: "It is exciting and valuable and interesting.   "Brian Malin deserves a lot of credit because he did not even delve into the jar and brought it into the museum punctually and he is rather sweet.   "He has not once asked about the value - he has asked 'how important is this and what can we learn?'"   In line with Britain's treasure trove laws, a coroner's inquest will be held and an independent panel will decide how much the 5,000-coin hoard is worth.   The panel will then mediate between the Ashmolean, which has said it wants to buy the pot of coins, and Mr Malin.     Notes and Observations   This is article definitely could be used as a starting point for an on-going campaign, one that is surrounded by the concept of a treasure hunt, or the retrival of lost objects of art.  However, instead of a romanesque coin, a coin substituted from an ancient Chessentan city-state (now a destroyed ruin or sunk beneath its the lands Northern shore) or a rare mintage from a successor state of Netheril (both of the Forgotten Realms) could park clues as the these emporer's lost treasure hordes as well as his or her existance based in fact, not belief or truth.  Yes, an interesting idea to spark a treasure hunt say the least.  - JW

      By Justin Parkinson 2004/03/04  urlLink  From the BBC   For a complete version of the article click and comments,  urlLink  Here      As if murderous orcs and magic spells weren't enough to contend with, there are two languages to learn - loosely based on Welsh and Finnish.   Undeterred by the challenge, a group of schoolboys has volunteered for lessons in Sindarin, the "conversational" form of Elvish, invented by Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien.   Zainab Thorp, a special needs co-ordinator at Turves Green Boys' Technology College in Birmingham, is offering after-hours classes, where pupils struggle through vocabulary and verb tables.   She said: "The recent success of the Lord of the Rings films has increased the interest in learning Elvish.   "The children really enjoy it. It breaks the idea that education should simply be aimed at getting a job."    A Little Romance   Tolkien, an Oxford academic who was expert in ancient languages, developed two forms of Elvish.   Sindarin - based on the sounds of Welsh - is the more commonly used. Quenya - related to Finnish - is largely a ceremonial language.    USEFUL SINDARIN WORDS  - Bast - Bread - Toss - Low-growing tree - Bess - Woman - Edhel - Elf - Annabon - Elephant - Salch - Grass  Tolkien, who died in 1973, only wrote down around 350 words in Sindarin, so Lord of the Rings experts have had to work together to increase the vocabulary for everyday use.   Mrs Thorp, who studied ancient Egyptian at university, said: "Tolkien never left a word meaning 'to love'.   "In one film, there was an early scene where the word 'aniron', usually meaning 'I want' - in the sense of wanting a cup of tea - was adapted to mean 'I love' between Aragorn and Arwen, two Elvish speakers.   "So this word now had romantic associations. David Salo, the expert working on the script, had to think of another word to mean 'I want', in case it seemed like one male elf asking another for something later on was mistakenly thought to have amorous intentions.   "So, he had to come up with another phrase roughly meaning 'It's necessary for me to have your help'.   "We have to be very careful to use words properly, as Sindarin was invented by Tolkien and we should show it respect."   But other than declaring one's undying love in an unusual fashion, what use does Elvish have?    Railway Sounds   Mrs Thorp said: "A couple of the boys are very into role-playing games. Knowing Sindarin is useful when giving orders to their Elvish armies.   "The reason I'm offering the lessons is to give the boys, some of whom have special educational needs, something to boost their self-esteem.   "They have responded very well and are eager to learn more. It's also very useful if they want to go on to university to study, as it involves looking at some of Tolkien's old manuscripts. This develops some very complex skills."   The number of Sindarin speakers worldwide is unknown but thought to be growing rapidly, following the success of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.   The final part, The Return of the King, won 11 Oscars on Sunday and has grossed more than $1bn (£540m).   Tolkien based the sounds of Sindarin on the Welsh words he was exposed to as a boy, living in a house overlooking the railway line from Wales to Birmingham.   Mrs Thorp said: "Tolkien liked to create beautiful sounds. It's very different from just studying a language like French: the boys are doing this for fun, like he did. That has to be a good thing."

      One night, I've scribbled down an idea regarding a meteorite crater, like the one in Arizona state, in regards to the faiths of Talos and Selune.  I was considering the area of impact a hotly contested holy sight (I.E. open warfare) for the two faiths.  I was wondering were I can place one say near a medium to large city that hasn't been used since the introduction of the first box set.  I'm leaning towards the Lake of Steam region, but I would like some more opinions.  There are some things I need to list members to take into consideration...  Background - There is nothing more destructive or more spectacular than a meteorite impact.  A meteorite impacted on Toril shortly before the end of the Avatar crisis (within 07 to 10 days) and decimated a city, but it did not destroy the city outright.  The Church of Talos (rather an underground cult) survived the decimation as did the Church of Selune, both with a large respective congregation each.  - An obvious omen, nay, a divine sign of great displeasure showing the raw power of Talos the Destroyer.  Talos must be pleased or his wrath will be even greater ("I can't say what greater is than a meteorite impact but it could involve the foot of Talos...."). They will not dispute this fact.  The evidence of the destruction is clear.  This is holy ground of Talos and all within it is their property.  They will fight to the death to keep it.  - The High Priest or Priestess of Selune disputes this fact and hotly blames the Talosian clergy for the destruction of the surrounding area. much of the city, and argues that the Priest of Talos "beckoned forth" the meteorite from its true course in a grab to consolidate their power and strengthen the faith of a corrupt godling.  He points to the fact that the "meteorite" was not a meteorite, but a large blue star sapphire wrought when it entered the atmosphere of Toril.   This star jewel is not to blame for the disaster that has befallen the people for the touch of Talos corrupted the jewel and used it to spread devastation and lies in its wake.  This star jewel must be removed from the confines the meteorite crater and purified by a high priestess for it is not the will of Talos to ruin Selune's gifts to her righteous (and rightful) children.  - The Talosian cleric considers this edict blasphemous and called for his bloody and violent death.  He has placed a bounty on the Selunite's head.  Obviously, this Selunite is treading in matters of Talosian faith where he or she should not.  - The survivors (The Talos faction, their allies, and their slave labor) spent the last ten years, up until 1372 DR, rebuilding or rather building something spectacular.  Rumor has it that the High Destroyer of Talos is constructing a dome to cover the entire circumference of the crater.  It's interior shall become the newest crown and greatest temple to the God of Destruction on Faerun.  (It's a life long project estimated to take twenty-five years to complete, much like the pyramids of Egypt.  And it's nearing the half-way mark of completion....   Miscellaneous Notes   - I've considered using the Faith of Talos and having them exercise a monopoly on power in the area.  This would force the Clerics of Selune and their mercenaries into the status of underground rebels, freedom fighters, smugglers, etc.  - The Church of Talos is not too picky on who aid in the construction of their latest shrine (slave labor, slavemasters, Deurgar, Underdark natives, etc.).  They are going to make it a wonder-of-the-world for Talos first, Toril second.  -I need the impact site, say near a large body of water with adequate resources (such as iron ore, carbon, a little adamantium and lots of limestone) and definitely access to the tunnels of the Underdark.  - The survivors and converts of the faiths split the city along evenly divided lines.  Mercantilism to the Maw is dangerous and but profitable for both and evil aligned companies and parties.  Labor, whether it be contacted or enforce by the whip is in short supply as are food stuffs, fresh water, raw goods, and other services.  Raids and banditry are a constant danger.  The High Priest of Talos is no violent idiot and what's good for the temple is good for Talos.  What viable trade routes or roads could lead to the Maw?  The impact was deep enough to reveal several subterranean passages to the Underdark.  ....And thus a civil war was born from an idea called "The Maw of Talos"  (c) Jeffrey Williams, 2004.

        The King cometh: The "barebones" Return of the King DVD is due Tuesday.   By Mike Snider   urlLink   From USA Today    Picture from New Line Cinema   The competition for the year's top-selling DVD begins Tuesday with the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.    The question on the minds of many: Can any '04 release top Finding Nemo's 21.5 million DVDs sold?   Peter Jackson's final chapter of the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy, which brought in $376 million at the box office, will rule in sales this week, with little notable competition among new titles.  But Return of the King faces big-time competition for the year. The major players:   •The Passion of the Christ (Aug. 31, $30). The surprise blockbuster is a notch below Return of the King, at No. 7, on the all-time box office chart, and that could indicate a close race. If churches buy in bulk as they did at the movies, it could be huge. Passion "is the real wild card," says Scott Hettrick, editor in chief of DVD Exclusive magazine. "It is really hard to predict how it will do on DVD. It could be a runaway success and get to that 25-million-plus stratosphere."  •Star Wars Trilogy (Sept. 21, $70). The movies make their DVD debut in a four-disc set, along with lots of extras. The trilogy has been the most-requested DVD since the format launched and should sell millions. But its price tag is steep, and the movies won't be available individually. Yet Video Store Magazine's research director Judith McCourt says: "With Star Wars, anything is possible."   •Shrek 2 (not announced but expected at the holidays). Even though Spider-Man 2 and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban also are expected at the holidays, industry experts predict Shrek will be the season's breakout. Live-action blockbusters typically can sell 18 million DVDs; animated titles have topped that because they appeal to a wider age range. "Given that track record, Shrek 2 has the best chance" to top Nemo, Hettrick says. Also in Shrek's corner: For the first year since DVD hit the mainstream, Disney doesn't have a monster animated film scheduled.   But, McCourt says, "there's always a summer surprise (at theaters), and I don't know what that is going to be this year."   Don't count out King for the DVD-selling crown At Borders, public relations manager Jenie Dahlmann says the release will benefit from being first and having little competition. "We have seen that any Rings DVD has been increasing in popularity. We don't see the enthusiasm dying; we see it growing," she says.  King "is rounding out someone's collection. We think it's going to be huge."  The movie's studio, New Line, hopes the entire franchise gets a boost. It's also releasing Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy ($90), a six-disc collection of the three theatrical versions. The studio expects sales of the first two to increase as well. The 11 Oscars won by King "add credibility to it as one 10-hour movie," New Line's Matt Lasorsa says. "We have tremendous expectations because this is the completion of the trilogy."

        Wand of Dimension Doors     History:  The manufacturer of these useful utility devices was the half-elven wizard Doloran Metziir of Westgate who lived some 125 years ago.  The wizard-merchant was known and well praised by his colleagues in the Art and was a frequent adventurer in Cormyr, Sembia, and the Dalelands.  Although he rarely instigated such confrontations, Doloran unfortunately and frequently crossed paths with the Night Masks on numerous occasions.  Doloran was an honest and forthright merchant who would rather haggle or persaude a potential customer in parting with his gold coins than pilfer, swindle or rob outright.  However, his open reputation earned him the contempt of the Night Masks until he was forced to slay three guild members in an act of self-defense.  Conflicts repeated themselves and soon escalated to a degree that often places his very life in danger. In one confrontation, Doloran, nearly delirious with poison, was able to dimension door away from his enemies and seek the curative magics from an Ilmatarian custodian.  Doloran vowed to Ilmater and Mystra that he would never allow himself to be caught in such a dire predicament again.  Thus his motivation was born to craft his Wands of Dimension Doors.  Over the decades of his long life, he was able to craft thirty such wands for friends, family, acquaintences, and wizards he considered friends.  Eventually death from advancing age took Doloran from his few remaining friends and students, but not before he penned his knoweldge into a set of three books.  All manuscripts are identical in each book (as written in Mystran archieves) as he gave one to his neice, Talamara the Brazen and his worthiest apprentise, Chalane of Mulmaster.  The third of three books was delivered to the War Wizards College of Cormyr were it rests in protective hands to this day.    Talamara and her copy disappeared in a violent tropical storm somewhere in the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Rumors and dusty tomes record that Talamara became petty and spoiled in her search for new magics.  In doing so she erroneously crossed paths with a high cleric of Umberlee who took her life and her copy of Doloran's works.  Unconfirmed reports has her today as undead, possibly a sea zombie or sea ghast, serving yet another of Umberlee's worthy priests.   Chalane's copy is believed to rest with his mortal remains somewhere on the southern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  His crypt is protected by the tight bonded magics and remains sealed even after sixty years.  No one has yet penatrated the doors to tomb within that period of time and many scholars believe Mystra herself has a direct hand in this situation.  Some state carefully and without blasphemy that Our Lady of Mysteries is waiting for the day when the abjurations will collaspe and her chosen servant will bring forth this lost magic to those worthy of it.    Function:  This wand functions in a method similar to the fouth level spell  Dimension Door .  When activated, the wand projects an energy bubble thats "pops" into existance as a shimmering disc-shaped doorway 7 ft in circumfrance and in any location desired by the user up to a maximum distance of 60 ft.  The wand can be used to "pop" a dimension door on a physical object such as a wall, door, or any inorganic object up 7 ft or more in circumfence.  However, upon contact with any living creature, it will pass harmlessly through it or any other object.  If the bubble strikes against undead, the bubble "pops" against and harmlessly dissipates wasting a charge.  The spell functions at eighth level ability and can transport up the wand weilder and an additional 400 pounds of matter.   Caster Level:  8th    Prerequisites:  Craft Wands, Quick Spell, Dimension Door  Market Cost:  24,000 GP  Cost to Create:  10,500 GP + 850 EXP      Personal Notes   Those wishing to expand of Doloran Metziir's personal knowledge of wizardry may do so.  Bear in mind though his favored spells schools are transmutation and translocation.  He also enjoyed abjuration magics and spells that envenomed weapons with a spoken word or phrase.  He was also fond of weapons that would bend or twist out of the hands of his enemies then turn and attack them.

         Two other character ideas, also based in the Forgoten Realms campaign setting are Esina Esined based on Denise (A V3 Character Kit).  Esina was born of the Moonshae Islands, but do to a tragedy in her youth, was washed ashore on the Islands of Latan were she was raised as a housegirl and servant to Ymra, a noblewoman of Latan.  There Esina was raised in arts and arms of sword and duty.  Her abilities as a sorceress would later manifest under the tutilage of her mistress, Ymra.  Esina is a multi-class character, a Fighter/Devoted Defender/Bard/Sorcer.  Her loyalty to ymra is beyond question as is her love and companionship.   Ymra Solmyr of the Blue Star, based on Atlantean Princess Aura (A V2 Chaarcter Kit)originates from the Isles of Latan.  Ymra is a cleric of Selune and extremly adept in the Art.  Ymra is a noble's daughter and considered royal blooded.  Ymra is the master to Denise, but does not treat her as such.  Ymra is devoted to Esina, as she is devoted to her.  A strong friendship that has on more than one occasion embraced bodies and transcended feelings and spirituality.  Ymra is multi-class character, a Fighter/Cleric of Selune/Wizard.  The Atlantean Princess Aura kit has apprently mean removed from the Renderosity store.  I will atempt to find a suitable picture or two in the near future and re-edit this posting.

           Delenhoure by  Orion1167  and Kashmira by Eowyn and Papu are two character designs I intend to use to illustrate PCs I have for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.  Delenhoure will be the basis for a character named Olijhanna Zo'Rhahn.  Dlenhoure has the right hieght, figure and that bitch demanor I am looking for in a spell-casting merchant.  Kashmira will be the basis for Olijhanna's "adopted daughter."  For the lack of a better term.  Kashmira is Olijhanna's devoted slave, bodyguard, and lover.  Although she has no name, Olijhanna is fond of calling her "Holly".  I need someone who is petite, agile, and has a tom-boyish beauty to her face and figure.  I needed a figure who pose and body language was not elvish, Ayrian, or blonde in a inner European sense, yet waifish but pleasing to the eye.

          Another Character idea for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.  I'm thinking of her a Ranger/Druid of Auril or Shaundakul.  Racially, she is an air genasi.

      I'm fiddling around with idea of a V3 character, Ehven by James Adadcytle, with the Drow Witch skin texture by Daio.  My second choice would be Kaede for Victoria 3.  She has similar body morphology.  I'll keep Ehven's body morph as it willcome in handy will other elven renders.  It's an idea and some pictures I would like to keep in storage for a bit.  Skin the hair color here and there, the pubic hair to a stark, and the eye color to match a surface heritage. I'll come back to them at a later date.       Daio's ProClub V3 Drow Witch is too large to fit onto my weblog, so any visual critiques or a peek by the cruious will have to be a the PoserPro store.  You do not need a membership to view, but if you wish to purchase product or download and save from the gallery, then, yes membership is required.  Daz 3d has a Drow texture I'm going to examine and post a potential link.

          Advanatages: Ki has the figure and physical body morph I am looking for in a petite V3 character without having to purchase the Stephanie or Stephanie P3 base kit.  Drawbacks:  Eye color is disproportionate with the character I am designing.  Her blue eyes and outside the norm of a gene pool that is asian and Japanese by genetics and geography.      Advantages: kaede has a better bust-to-waist-to-hip ratio, or the one I am looking for in a woman of asian or mixed asian/caucasian birth.  She is also a cheaper purchase than Ki.  Disadvanatges: None    Advanatges: Proper eye colors and tattoos that could be incorporated into Kaede or Ki with some work for the latter.  Plus I've already purchased Sayuri.  Disadvantages:  Wrong facial morph and wrong body morph.  Sayuri would serve better in a pure Japenese render, possible medieval or cyberpunk ala Akira or Ghost in the Shell.  Body morph males her a full figured woman rather than a lean adult.
