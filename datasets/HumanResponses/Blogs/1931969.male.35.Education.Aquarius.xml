      Greetings.  People say third time's the charm.  Well, I hope they're right since this is the third time i've tried to build this blog.  The first time was ok for about a month and then everything that could go wrong, did in fact go wrong: computers crashing, drives burning, you name it.  the second time, well, it was more of my fault, so I hope this time we'll do better.  I am writing from Patras, Greece and i am interested in all those things (small and big ones) tha make you go "hmmm..."  be back soon.  ikd, 20042805135000

      Hola!  It's a very warm 33 degrees Celcius (that's about 88 deg. on the Fahrenheit scale) here in Patras, Greece.  Euro2004 football is on the telly from Portugal, the Italians were given their tickets back home (compliments of Scandinavian air-lines, eer ..., sorry, I meant Sweden and Denmark), and who cares about work?  The outdoor cafes and bars and restaurants are filled to capacity, there is a buzz in the air, people chatting, having fun, relaxing.  No worries about the office tomorrow, the economy, the Olympics (yeah, right!). Nothing.  That brought to mind a picture I was sent to a couple of days ago from a friend.  source is unknown, as is the author/maker of the picture.  It fits perfectly though with the general atmosphere of euphoria, this "feelin' good" thing...    Is there a better way to spend your day in the office?  I think not.

      Hi.  A good friend of mine sent me this interesting image.    One can only assume that the Hungarian(s) bureaucrat(s) who was/were working at their local department of transportation was/were not fluent in English.   However, one cannot but simply ask the question: "What were they thinking when they issued this car plate?"  Cheers,  Ioannis, 20040621154000  P.S. No, I am not going to write/discuss about yesterday's game between Greece and Russia for Euro2004.  As one sports site put it very eloquently, it was a russian roulette game, but the bullet exploded in Spain's head :) icd

      In the general climate of pan-hellenic euphoria after the 1-1 draw against Spain,  I think that Otto Rehhagel, coach of our national soccer team, should be our next president of the hellenic republic.  He deserves it 100%.  Mostly, because he took a bunch of overpaid, under-stimulated, super-egotistical players and turned them into a superb fighting team.  Be on the lookout now for the final match against Russia on Sunday, when a draw is enough to  send Greeks into the second round, and an entire country into pandaemonium.  Cheers, and as the Greek fans chant: Είναι τρελός, είναι τρελός ο Γερμανός (He is crazy, the German is crazy)...  Ioannis, 200040616211000

       That is the question!   Here are the choices for all of us on planet Europe, today on Sunday June 13, 2004:  1) Euro-elections. 2) Euro-football. 3) (special choice for mediterranean countries only): Go to the beach.  The dilemma is even more complicated given that, at least here in Greece, there is Croatia vs. Switzerland (at 7pm local time), there is England vs. France (at 9:45pm, also local time).  Then there is Formula 1 from Canada (around 11 pm).  Somewhere in between there will be all the regular talking head shows about the elections for the European Parliament held over this weekend in 25 European countries.    And of course, don't forget that there will also be more triumphant stories about Greece's victory over Portugal at the kickoff of Euro2004.  Whatever you watch, enjoy it!

      Hello,  I had planned something else for today, but I heard on the radio that Prof. Xenophon Zolotas, a well-known public figure in Greece passed away at the age of 100.  He was one of the youngest professors of the University of Athens, Governor of the Bank of Greece, member of the National Academy, and in 1989 served briefly as prime minister.  However, most of us here in Greece remember him because of two speeches he gave back in the 1950s at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  He used only Greek words adopted by the English language.  One of the words was the winning word at the US Spelling Bee contest (the word was "authochthons").  Here is what he said about the speech:  ====================  ``I always wished to address this Assembly in Greek, but I realized that it would have been indeed Greek to all present in this room. I found out, however, that I could make my address in Greek which would still be English to everybody. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I shall do it now, using with the exception of articles and prepositions only Greek words.''   And here is the speech itself:  Kyrie,  It is Zeus’ anathema on our epoch for the dynamism of our economies and the heresy of our economic methods and policies that we should agonize between the Scylla of numismatic plethora and the Charybdis of economic anemia.  It is not my idiosyncrasy to be ironic or sarcastic but my diagnosis would be that politicians are rather cryptoplethoristic. Although they emphatically stigmatize numismatic plethora, energize it through their tactics and practices.  Our policies have to be based more on economic and less on political criteria. Our gnomon has to be a metron between political, strategic and philanthropic scopes. Political magic has always been antieconomic.  In our epoch characterized by monopolies, oligopolies, monopsonies, monopolistic antagonism and polymorphous inelasticities, our policies have to be more orthological. But this should not be metamorphosed into plethorophobia, which is endemic among academic economists.  Numismatic symmetry should not antagonize economic acme.  A greater harmonization between the practices of the economic and numismatic archons is basic.  Parallel to this, we have to synchronize and harmonize more and more our economic and numismatic policies panethnically.  These scopes are more practical now, when the prognostics of the political and economic barometer are halcyonic.  The history of our didymous organizations in the sphere has been didactic and their Gnostic practices will always be a tonic to the polyonymous and idiomorphous ethnical economics. The genesis of the programmed organizations will dynamize these policies. I sympathize, therefore, with the apostles and the hierarchy of our organizations in their zeal to program orthodox  economic and numismatic policies, although I have some logomachy with them.  I apologize for having tyrannized you with my Hellenic phraseology.  In my epilogue, I emphasize my eulogy to the philoxenous autochthons of this cosmopolitan metropolis and my encomium to you,   Kyrie, and the stenographers. ====  May his soul rest in peace.

      Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.  (Όσα κι αν εύρη η χειρ σου του ποιήσαι, ως η δύναμίς σου ποίησον).    The rest of the non-speaking, non-reading Greek can dismiss the above sentence.  It's all Greek to you.  I was looking at my  urlLink "new" homepage  the other day, and stumbled across this verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament.  Its simplicity, its power, its wisdom struck me hard.  I don't know why.  The first time I read the phrase it was in the classic "The Caine Mutiny" book by Herman Wouk.  I have never found a more powerful phrase from the Holy Bible, with the exception of the opening of the Gospel according to St. John.  But that's another story for another day.

      and so on.  Way back in the ancient history days of the web, I had access to the raw logs of my webpage.  Now, ... well things are different.  Though, yahoo did provide some stats, they were in summary form.  There was no information about countries, IP addresses, browsers etc.  Plus, yahoo had these annoying pop-up ads.    Change hosting site and moving to the good people at portland communications.  Plenty of space.  Now, what site-metering service to use?  I started with  urlLink extreme-tracking  and it was great, but it only kept the last 20 or so visitors.  No logs. No back ups (bad idea)...  Moved over to  urlLink stat counter .  So far, great reports, graphics, logs (in cvs or xls format).  Great, thus far.  I am also experimenting with  urlLink site meter , yet another service.  I read about them this morning, as I was leafing through the  urlLink O'Reilly  book on  urlLink blogging .  I moved the blog to site meter, and I am keeping the  urlLink rented site  to stat counter.  Just to check on things.  Of course, one might ask why I bother with all these?  As if this page gets dozens of hits daily.  No, this site doesn't receive so many visitors.  But, call me curious, weird, or whatever, I just want to know who's knocking on my web-door, how they find the place, whether they like it or not.  So, whether you are a new or a returning visitor, leave your name (or even assumed one) somewhere, drop a line and just say "hi"...  Ioannis, 20040731184000

      This has been a busy period of time for everyone.  I mean besides the daily work load, there is a move involved from the current living place to a new one, thankfully only a few blocks down the road.  Basically, the out-going place is a mess right now and here are some quick images I took this morning.  I expect things to get even worse in a few days time.  Image of the  urlLink empty bookshelves in my office , and two images from a packed with boxes living/dining room  urlLink (1)  and  urlLink (2) .  For those interested, all pictures were taken with an S55 Siemens mob phone and the attached camera at 640x480.  No further processing was involved.  More pictures later on.

      In a post at  urlLink Boing Boing  Cory Doctorow suggests ways to bypass the registration uglyness that certain sites throw upon the hapless reader.   Further, there is a very nice util/plugin available  urlLink here  that will generate random userids/passwds for registration-mandatory sites, such as the NYTimes.     I tried it and I can tell you I will try it again and again.  I have no grudge against registrations except I cannot remember all my combinations of userids/passwds.  That would lead me to recycle a set of userid/passwd and some where along the line lose it with all the consequences that may come with such a loss. I have no problem clicking on a button, but I have no desire to enter a zillion details (that's personal information, I might add) about jobs, employment, salaries etc.  Keep the web free. That was the original idea, that is still the idea.  Keep news and information free.  The alternative is ... well, read Caleb Carr's "Killing Time" and you will understand.

      It's not news by now, but it's newsworthy.  King Otto II (i.e., Otto Rehhagel a.k.a. Otto Rehhakles), winning coach of the Greek national football team, has not abdicated his throne. He rejected the multi-million euro offer by the German football federation and decided to stay in Greece and continue the work he and his colleagues have started for 3 years now.  In other words, we will see all of you in Germany in 2006 at the Final Game of the World Championship against Germany or maybe Brazil?  Το πήραμε το ... ευλογημένο, άλλο πια, άλλο πια δεν περιμένω και το 2006 στη Γερμανία τελικό, τελικό με Βραζιλία.  Ioannis, 20040711021500

      Well,   Now that King Otto I and his band of underpaid (according to European standards), underestimated, and misrepresented players have won the Euro2004,  Now that the lights have been switched off finally and everyone had a chance to drown his happiness or sorrow,  Now that the big question is "will he stay or will he go back to Germany?",  I would like to remind all those ill-mannered, bad-tempered weirdos who did not believe in the team (both in Greece and abroad) the old adage that says:   Offense wins games, but defense wins championships .

      Well, I am not going to comment on the night-long celebrations and festivities held in Athens, Greece upon the return of Greek national football team.  The major news networks have already done so in splendid fashion.  You can read what the  urlLink BBC ,  urlLink CNN/Sports Illustrated , and  urlLink Reuters  wrote.  However, I believe that this quote by legendary football (as in US-style football, not soccer) coach Vince Lombardi fits the bill perfectly:  ===== I firmly believe that any man's finest hour --- his greatest fulfillment to all he holds dear is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle --- victorious. =====  And this is exactly what our team did: they withstood all pressure, they beat seemingly unbeatable opponents and in the end, they stood there exhausted and victorious for the whole world to admire.  We are the champions. Period. Δεν μπορώ να περιμένω, σήκωσε ... το ευλογημένο  Ioannis, 20040706115000

      In the overall spirit of euphoria blanketing the country only hours before the crucial semi-final soccer game against the national Czech team, it reminds me of the days of summer 1987.  Back then, the Greek national basketball team beat several major basketball powers to claim its first European Title.  France, Yugoslavia (yes there was a country once upon a time called Yugoslavia), Soviet Union (remember that, too?), Italy all went down.    People danced on the streets, the whole country just ... stopped for a moment or two to grasp the reality.  And the music, ah, the music.  The final countdown by Europe, nice song from the german band set the rhythm for the celebrations.  I only hope that we will be able to repeat that feat in soccer, as well, and celebrate to the tunes of the "Final Countdown" once more.  Till then, ... Czechs be ware of the Greeks.      Δεν μπορώ να περιμένω, φέρτε το ... (το τιμημένο)    Ioannis, 20040701141000

      A very quick addendum to the previous posting.   I was reading and re-reading my last entry about information not being knowledge and I wondered about the accuracy of the statement.  A quick google search and the first hit gave the title to this entry. Apparently, it comes from an article titled "Information Does not Equal Knowledge: Theorizing the Political Economy of Virtuality" by Marcus Breen.  Here is an excerpt from the abstract:  This paper argues that causation theory has a role in discussions about knowledge in the virtual context. Drawing on cultural studies, it suggests that the fragmentation of rational knowledge in the postmodern world has produced a focus on information that is unaware of its history. A knowledge gap has been produced that needs careful consideration by those people and institutions advocating the use of virtual technologies.  Although even this point of view is specific (as was the original one by Caleb Carr), it supports the original idea about the disconnection between information and knowledge.  As Breen puts it, "the fragmentation of rational knowledge in the postmodern world has produced a focus on information that is unaware of its history."   Excellent point!  Information without history (ie, without the background, without the source or the reason) does not make knowledge.  Such information is without merit, value and does not assist in the creation of new knowledge.  Ioannis

      I was updating my  urlLink Quotes page  with this  unusual  quote from author Caleb Carr:  For it is the greatest truth of our age: Information is not knowledge   I started wondering about the implications of his statement. Is information knowledge or not? Is knowledge something more that bits of information piled together?

      when you are in the theater.  If there is one thing that annoys me the most, this must be the sound and sight of a mobile phone ringing (or lighting or vibrating) in a theater.  The other day, I was attending a wonderful performance by Deborah Myers with the Plucked Strings Orchestra of the City of Patras (more info  urlLink here ).  Before the show started, the organizers asked for all cameras, mob phones to be switched off.  Well, some "smart-ass" guy thought "hey, wouldn't it be cool to take some pictures?" In an instant, two event staffers approached him and politely asked him to delete the pictures and shut his phone off.  That reminded me of something I read in  urlLink zdet.com  about a couple being pepper sprayed and arrested in St. Petersburg, FL while talking on the phone in a movie theater.  Well, apparently, this odd couple were talking on their phones and after refusing to turn them off, they became aggressive and verbally abusing to the police officers who responded to the scene. The complete account is here:  urlLink St. Petersburg, FL incident .  I don't know if such extreme measures were appropriate, but it was about time somebody did  something on behalf of all the movie goers and theater audiences who don't appreciate being interrupted by mob phone ringtones, melodies, lights, vibra sounds etc.  What do you think?  Ioannis.
