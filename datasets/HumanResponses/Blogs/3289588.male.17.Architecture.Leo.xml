      I have really enjoyed this class a lot and I would like to have a career in computer engineer. I really enjoy making the first website cause when I showed it to my friends they didn't even want to believe that I did it. So I explained it to them and then they were like damn you did do it. They want me to teach them how to do it. I might have to make some money off this skill that I have learned. Of coarse I haven't done the best that I could have done but if I have an opening in my schedule I might have to take another class with Mr. Rea.   This class is going to help me in the future because when I go to college and if they try to teach me to make a web page I will already know how.

      Well I handle boredom pretty good cause I always dose off into space and I don't do drugs or anything like that cause I value my life too much. I would rather play basketball or football with my friends. Or go out to eat and watch games or maybe go to a game room and shoot some pool. I am always to busy to get bored so I don't have to worry about drugs or other bad stuff like that.

       First I will graduate high school then I'll go to college and I'll play the lotto. If I win then I will have a great life without work cause I will invest lots of money and have it work for me. If not then I will just have to stick to my career which is going to be something important and I am going to make lots of money doing it. Maybe I'll be a computer engineer or major in business management. And in these jobs will be very rewarding. I'll have a big house drive a skyline and treat my wife like a queen and I wouldn't care if my friends say that I am whooped cause I don't care what people think. So if I go to college I will have positive outcomes.

      I would like to be a little cute puppy because when girls see me they will want to hold and pet me. They will say aww look at the little puppy and when a puppy does something wrong all they say is aww it's ok and they will kiss and hug me. On the other hand I would like to be a flying lizard cause they can walk on walls and they can fly I don't think that there is a such thing as a flying lizardbut I don't care. I would fly every where and scare lots of people. the end

      My hole family is the coolest family but if I have to chose I pick my dad. My dad is the coolest because he supports my hole family. He works day and night and he trusts me and is very proud of all my accomplishments. He is always there when I need him and is always on my side. He likes to travel to and we like to go fishing when ever he is not working. When ever I have a goal in mind he is always by my side until I accomplish it. I think that I would like to be most like him because he is responsible and is also a very hard worker. He is also a perfectionist and I try to be also.

      In the future I plan to go to college and get a well paying job. I also plan to buy a big house and treat my wife like a queen. My wife will never have to work or do anything besides make me happy and spend my money. I would like to take my wife on romantic trips to other countries. I plan to be very successful and live a very good life. When I do get my well paying job I will try to get a car collection. One of my hobbies will be racing so that my wife can tell me no don't do that and she can worrie about me and then I'll still do it.

      I regret going to Furr high School last year because that school sucks and they messed up my life. I could have been a senor this year and I could have been headed off to collage this fall. But they messed up my credits said that they could not give me credit for the rest of the school year so I didn't finish the school year last year. So I am stuck with another high school year.  I would do anything to go back and change ever going to furr high school. The only thing that I ever liked about that school was the football team because there is so much chaos there. IT's like nobody like each other there because everybody is alway's fighting at that school. I have never seen as many fights in my life as I seen in that school.  Wait the only other thing I liked about that school is that I got to lift weights at lunch and in one of my classes. Other than that I don't really like anything else about that school. So I really regret going to that school yeah.

      I am up for anything and I love to do crazy stuff. One of my favorite things to do is travel and see new places and try new things. Like one time me and my friend were in my kitchen and my mom said something about my sister in Minnesota and me and my friend looked at each other and said lets go to Minnesota. That night we got our stuff ready and then the next day at five in the morning we were on our way to Minnesota.  We were so anxious to get there that we did not even stop anywhere unless we had to put gas. When we put gas That was our chance to go to the restroom or to get something to eat. We bought lots of stuff for the road of coarse. We went like in September so the weather was perfect. We sped almost the whole way over there, ok the whole way over there sshhhhh don't tell my mom.   We got lucky cause we don't even have a radar detector and we did not even get caught until we were on the way back. Guess who's turn it was to drive, yes of coarse it was my turn to drive and with my luck I got pulled over going about 130 miles and hour. The officer didn't even have to use his radar to see that I was speeding he said he saw me from a mile away and he tryed to catch up to me for about ten miles and finale he got me. He said that he almost lost hope and stoped chasing me but he saw my lights in the distance so he kept going.  Yes I got a ticket and so did my friend cause he is 22 and I am under age and I don't have a license. But we had lots of fun in Minnesota. We went to the biggest mall in the world which is Mall of America, it was so nice and very big we didn't even get to go to all the places that we wanted to go because we were so tired.

      Hey yall my name is Eric and I am 17 years old will be 18 in August. I live in Houston,  Texas but I am originaly from Calif-orn-I-A am a very outgoing person and I am up for anything at anytime. I like to stay out late at night and kick it with my friends. I Love to race. I like import cars muscle cars are ok but I would rather make something fast than to just buy something fast, I count that as cheating.   My favorite basketball team is the Los Angeles Lakers and my favorite football Team is the Oakland Raiders. One of my favorite restaurants is Hooters cause the wings are good and I can watch all the important games and boxing matches there. And the fact that there is beautiful girls in little shorts and tight shirts helps it out also.
