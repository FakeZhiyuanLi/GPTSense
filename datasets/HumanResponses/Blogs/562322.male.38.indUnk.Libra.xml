       He Is Risen!   I wish I knew how to say it, and not have it sound like a cliché.  But I have to say it: Jesus is risen!  On this day, when so much pain encompasses the world, when the very land of Jesus is wracked with violence and suffering, I must speak the truth.  He is alive!  The problems of the world seem so overwhelming.  I find that despair is often at my door.  But we can know in our heart of hearts that the pain we see will  not  have the final answer.  The pessimist would say that all of the suffering in the world is reality. He would say that Christians who are joyful and have hope really only have their head in the sand.  Yet the pessimist misses the fact that the joyful, the beautiful, the sacred things that happen are just as real as the evil that we see.  To see only the evil is to despair.  To see only the good is to deny reality.  To see the evil, but to see that God will eventually be victorious, that good will win, and that truth, beauty, and mercy will have the last say, is to be a Christain.  I’ll say it again:  He is alive!  Jesus is risen!

       Great Joy   I want to make a note today of the great joy in my life.  I tend to write in order to deal with problems.  When life is going well then I tend not to write.  I love my family!  I look at my children and I am  overwhelmed  with love.  It just flows and wells up within me.  I desire their happiness, holiness and growth with my whole being.   Hektor, in book six of The Iliad, captures this feeling:   Then taking up his dear son he tossed him about in his arms, and kissed him, and lifted his voice in prayer to Zeus and the other immortals: `Zeus, and you other immortals, grant that this boy, who is my son, may be as I am, pre-eminent among the Trojans, great in strength, as am I, and rule strongly over Ilion; and  some day let them say of him: ``He is better by far than his father'' ...',  (emphasis mine)   It must be a tremendous burden to have children, love them like this, and not know the Lord.  I would have unrelenting anxiety if I did not know that Jesus loved them even more than I do.  I would go crazy with fear for them.  Thank you, Lord, for your love and care.

       On being a rotten parent   Last night was a  very  frustrating night.  My four-year-old daughter, Amanda, has pink-eye.  She is supposed to receive drops in her eyes three times a day.  Amanda doesn’t want drops in her eyes three times a day.  She doesn’t want drops in her eyes once a day.  She would rather be forced to sit still for ten straight hours than get drops in her eyes.  (Actually, if given the choice between the two, she’d choose neither.  She has yet to fully grasp the concept that a choice between several things you don’t like has to include one of the things you don’t like.  But I digress.)   I tried a variety of tactics to get the drops in her eyes, but they all boiled down to bribery, threats, or force.  Last night, none of them worked. (I didn’t really try force.  I made her sit in my lap, but I couldn’t figure out a way to make her hold her eye open against her will.)  She kept getting more and more upset, taking more and more time.  Eventually I had to give up.  By that time it was also time for Emily, my six-year-old, to also go to bed, so they both went without our usual long story time.  I really didn’t know what to do in this situation.  I felt bad for Emily since she missed out on the story and had to put up with all the screaming from Amanda.  I felt bad for Amanda because she needs the medicine, plus it does her  no  good to win fights with me.  (More on that thought later.)  And I felt bad for me because it put the whole evening in a depressing mode.  I am glad that I had the grace to not try to really force her to take the drops.  In a situation like this it is very hard to tell how much of her behavior is motivated by fear and how much is willful disobedience.  A good friend and I were talking yesterday about how much our image of God comes from our fathers.  It is an  awesome  responsibility.  I realize that I fail miserably in that responsibility in many ways.  Yet, I also have many times where I can see that Jesus gave me the grace to do the right thing, say the right word, and show my children the love of the Father.  We have to be really humble, begging God to make us the parents we should be and to protect our children from our failings.

      I finished the main ``Freespace'' campaign.  That was a really fun program.  Now, instead of just installing another campaign, I’m going to go to bed.  Tonight I almost completed my taxes while Densie (my lovely wife), Donna and Gene (my wonderful in-laws) took care of the children.  It is wonderful to have them (almost) done.  Tomorrow I start on Mom's taxes.  God bless you all.

       Retreat at Pacem     The following are excerpts from my journal entries written while I was at  Pacem in Terrace , a wonderful retreat center in Minnesota.  I took this retreat in early February.  When you take a retreat at Pacem, you get a little one-room cabin in the woods.  You spend your time praying, reading, writing and sleeping.  With the exception of weekday dinners you do  not  spend time talking with other people.  It is amazingly peaceful.   February 1, 2002     Tonight I sit in my little hermitage at Pacem in Terrace. I'm at the St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalene hermitage.  I am enjoying the quiet.  My thoughts coming up here were somewhat scattered.  Earlier I had fears about the silence, fears about boredom, and fears that I would feel afraid!  Now the Spirit of Peace is filling the room.  I feel scattered, but not distraught.  I need so much just to experience silence.    My thoughts turn to Dear Denise who is very likely experiencing no silence right now.  Bless her, Lord!  Bless my entire little family.    Looking for an anchor for this time, I opened my Bible to Psalm&nbsp;30.  Verse 2 reads ``Oh Lord my God, I cried to Thee for help and Thou hast healed me.''  That is my anchor tonight.   February 2, 2002     What a joyous, calming time this has been!  The Lord is marvelous and gracious to me.  I feel so much at peace.    It has been a time of soothing.  Last night I slept almost 13 hours!  I didn't feel exhausted when I went to bed around 9:00 PM.  But I woke up, realized the sun was up, and rested a while more.  When I finally got up, it was almost 10:00 AM!    The simple ritual of making my meals has given me great pleasure.  Arranging my bread, fruit and cheese while brewing a cup of tea was, again, soothing and peaceful.    When I cracked the window for fresh air I was delighted to discover that falling snow makes noise!    I am struck at how much we must all miss in the constant noise that surrounds us.  Last night, well after dark, I had been looking out the window.  It was inky blackness.  There were a couple of stars, but almost nothing else ware really intelligible.  Then I turned out the lights.  It was amazing to see how well lit and clear it was outside!  What had been an uninviting gloom became a forest underneath a blanket of stars.    I  must  cut down on the noise and chatter in my life!  How much is the Lord trying to say that I never hear?    During my walk I was asking Jesus to calm my spirit.  I want to know if where I am is where He wants me (especially regarding job, use of money, etc.).  If it is not, then where should I go?  My concern still centers on money.  We have so much while others have so little.  While praying, several thoughts came to me:             Jesus desires all to be saved, and has made it possible for all (from the morning's office of readings).           Jesus chose for me to be born at this time, in this society, in this family.           He is with me, loves me, does not want me to live in servile fear.        It was a calling again back to prayer.  Jesus wants to speak with me, communicate His love to me, each day.  When I am listening and loving He can direct me in these other areas.    Sertillanges' book has addressed itself to the act of writing.  He emphasizes the importance of it, and how one  must  create in order to continue to grow.    My first reaction was discouragement.  I started to cast about, thinking about things I could write.  Then, came anxiety about my schedule.  How can I write and do all of the other things I'm suppoes to do?  I fell pulled in 20 direction in life, and I never seem to walk any of the paths well.  It seems I should take a look at my roles in life and the major responsibilities in each.  Then, purpose to focus on particular areas and make progress in them.    But first, I must return to focus on the Lord.  Desire to live well is, I pray, a gift of grace.  Anxiety and panic in the face of my many responsibilities and obligations is not.

The big news lately is that I've been teaching a class on Greek and Roman liturature to some home-schooled high school students.  It has been rather challenging to adequately prepare for the classes, but I've enjoyed it.

       Great Books by Polish Popes:   OK, so the list of Polish Popes is not extremely long. But one of the great books by John Paul II is "The Way to Christ". It is a set of talks he gave to some retreats back before he became Pope. His insight into human nature and what it takes to be truly fulfilled is amazing.

       Video Games, Books, Writing   Does anyone else out there struggle with being useful with their computer?  (Kind of ties in with the Douglas Adams quote, now that I think about it.)  I'm the kind of person who has always loved playing with computers.  I was in eighth grade when my father brought home our first computer: A Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I computer with Level II BASIC and 16K of RAM (That's right: 16K!  Four times the memory of the low-end machine!).  It turns out that I was just the right age at just the right time to really benefit from this machine.  I was old enough to play with it and start working my way through the "Teach Yourself BASIC" manual.  The really good thing, however, was that computing was new enough that there were very few games available to play on the computer.  I was forced to program because I could not just go out and buy good games.   If I was born a few years earlier, I might have gotten turned on to some other hobby and never really explored computers.  If I was born a few years later, there would have been so many great games available that I never would have bothered to learn to program.  I can say that with some confidence now, because it takes a lot of self control for me to not just throw in a video game when I really know I'd like to be writing or reading.  That is just the struggle in so much of life, isn't it?  It is what Christianity calls "seeking the greatest good".  it is doing what is best when there is something good nearby.

       Recent Reading:  Monsters From the Id , by E.&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Jones     I should start off by saying that this book has provided me the most intriguing reading I've had in recent memory.  It is the first time I have waded into the waters of serious literary criticism, and I really did not know what to expect.  The experience was refreshing and thought-provoking.  He has an original and fascinating interpretation of the series of  Alien  movies that alone is worth the read.   Monsters From the Id  traces the development of the horror genre.  It starts with  Frankenstein  and works its way through to  Aliens&nbsp;III .  Jones makes a convincing case that the beginning and continued popularity of horror are due to psychological responses to sexual "liberation" and its  consequences. The thesis of the book is encapsulated by the two quotes that make up the first page.  The first is from the Book of James:    Everyone who is tempted is attracted and seduced by his own wrong desire.  Then the desire conceives and gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown it too has a child, and the child is death.     The second is from the classic movie  Forbidden Planet:  "The Krell forgot one thing, the monsters from the Id."   If I am reading correctly, his basic argument could be expressed as follows:              When sexual activity is separated from the moral order the  inevitable  result is pain, sorrow, horror, and death          Starting with the French Revolution, the Enlightenment (to which we are all heirs) very explicitly rejected that there was      any standard of morality to which men should be bound. In fact,      Enlightenment thinkers saw the key to all human happiness to be      the casting off of restrictions on sexual activity so that all      people could completely fulfill themselves.               The inevitable pain, misery and death followed the      loosening of sexual morals.  Different times and locations experienced this suffering in a variety of ways. During the French Revolution it manifested itself in sadism and widespread brutal violence. Germany  and much of Europe were haunted by the devastating effects of syphilis. When the "Enlightenment" liberation of sexual morals came to America it brought in its wake  divorce, rape, broken families, and the "unspeakable crime" of abortion.               Western civilizations have accepted at a very deep level that there are no moral values, and the sexual freedom is fundamental to a fulfilled and happy life.  This commitment to sexual license is so deep and so axiomatic for so many people that they are absolutely at a loss to explain the suffering that is rooted in immoral sexual behavior.  The realization of the connection between immorality and suffering  must  be repressed.  But this repressed idea then surfaces forcefully in other ways.  One of the ways is through horror.         The repression of the connection does not make it go away.  Sexual immorality brings with it a general sense of dread, foreboding, or the feeling that things are not right.  The monsters of the horror books and films are the manifestations of this dread.          At first, I was skeptical, but Jones has me convinced.  His thesis explains one aspect of most horror films that has puzzled many critics. Why do so many films associate the attack of the monsters with sex?  Why is it so often the case that characters in films are attacked and killed during or right after sex?  The implicit message sent is that sex is dangerous and that having sex will hurt or kill you.  Yet one can hardly accuse the horror movie industry of prudishness.  Would it not make sense for most writers and directors of these films to send the exact opposite message?  Jones is arguing that the writers and directors of these films can not see the connection between immorality and suffering because of their ideological commitment to the primacy of sexual license.  Yet their subconscious makes the connection and so the connection is expressed in these books and films.  These films then draw audiences because they are saying something true, even though neither the makers nor the audiences can explicitly acknowledge the truth expressed.  If you're unconvinced, I urge you to read the book for itself.  It is well worth it simply for his discussion of the series of  Alien  films.  You can find the book at  urlLink Spence Publishing .

       Book log:  Making Christ's Peace a Part of Your Life  by Dietrich von Hildebrand   This has been the first of Dietrich Von Hildebrand's books that I have been able to complete.  (Probably this is because it is actually an excerpt from his book  Transformation in Christ .)  It is an extremely challenging work analyzing the peace that comes from Jesus.  Von Hildebrand discusses what it is (and is not), how we can get it and how we can lose it.  He also spends considerable time discussing why it is important and the consequences both of finding and losing it.   Short Review: Read it.  Very, very good.   Some insights:       Distinguishing between true peace and simple absence of conflict:      The absence of all inward unrest is by no means invariably a good.  It is a good on the condition only that it comes from a harmony with objective good and expresses a response to Truth.  Sated contentment or a peace of mind due to thoughtlessness or illusion, is not a good but an evil - no matter how pleasant it may subjectively feel. [pg.&nbsp;35]       Evaluating our emotional reactions to things that happen to us:  First of all, the attitude must match the goodness or badness of the thing to which it is reacting.  If we are sad at a friend's good fortune, or take joy at someone else's pain, then our attitudes are wrong.  Secondly, the intensity of the attitude must match the objective importance of things to which it is reacting.  Do we get more excited about a football game than someone coming to know the Lord?      Most importantly:  True peace can come  only  to those who surrender to God:      The nagging unrest of him who doubts and of him who writhes in the fetters of sin, the most deeply painful experience of unrest will dissolve as soon as he achieves an unequivocal surrender to God:  peace will come to man when he lets himself fall into the arms of God... [pg.&nbsp;43]     There is much more that I'd like to write, but I must be off.  May the peace of Christ be with you.

       The Night Before Christmas   Well, it is the Night Before Christmas.  I was planning on writing about a professor of religion speaking on NPR today, but at 1:06AM I just don't have the energy.  We have gotten all of the kids down, we have the presents wrapped, and we are all eager for the morrow.  Unfortunately, the morning will arrive for my children at the crack of dawn, so I best get to bed.  It was the usual struggle this year.  It is so easy to get swept up in the flurry of preparation, and lose sight of the fact that this is a celebration of  Christ's birth! .  So, let's end this with a word of thanks to Jesus, the Word made flesh, who clothed Himself in our humanity to save us, and let us be with Him forever.  Thank you, Lord!

Davey managed to fall and cut his lip pretty badly a couple of days ago.  It required a trip to the dentist and doctor, but he was spared any stiches.  We've seen indications from others that we can expect more of the same from our boys.

       Complaining as an Art Form   The other night my youngest daughter, Amanda (who will turn six in a few weeks) discovered that I had committed  a most insidious and vile act: I had brought home a pizza from Papa Murphy's that was contaminated with both mushrooms and tomatoes!  The poor little thing was completely distraught.  She cried and wailed.  She explained to me repeatedly that she  hates  mushrooms and that she  hates  tomatoes and that she was  really  expecting a plain pizza with pepperoni, not sausage like this one had.  (In her defense, she was tired and getting over a cold.  She is prone to emotional outbursts, but this was quite a bit more severe than usual.)  This went on for about 20 minutes until her hunger started to get the better of her upsetness.  She was still whimpering and muttering as she finally sat down at table and started to eat.  During her travailing the rest of the family had started eating.  There were only two pieces left besides the one that had been sitting on Amanda's plate.  As she ate, Amanda continued to mutter and occasionally complain as she removed bits of mushroom and tomato.  Then, without the slightest pause, she cried, "Hey!  You didn't save me any more pizza!" and started to cry about the fact that there was only one extra piece for her besides the one on her plate.  Some nights, you just gotta complain.

       Recent Book:  Amusing Ourselves to Death   by Neil Postman  This book had been sitting on my shelf for some time.  I started it once several years ago, got distracted from it  and never went back.  Then, around the turn of the new year, a radio station was talking about people who he died in 2003.  Neil Postman's name was mentioned, so I found and dusted off my copy and dove in.  This was an incredibly insightful book.  I, like many others, have long felt that television's influence on society was, on the whole, extremely destructive.  But I had not been able to explain  why  so much on TV is so bad.  Why did TV draw such consistently horrible content?  Why were examples of intellectually challenging and coherent programming so incredibly rare?  My first tendency has been to simply blame the people in charge of television production.  If the people creating the shows are focused on the trivial and the banal then we would expect their show to reflect that.  But this never really explained why so many of the people producing TV shows are unable to deal with any kind of serious intellectual content.  Postman makes the argument that it is the medium of television itself that drives such vapid content.  Television, by it's very nature, demands at least two things:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All information must be presented in a "context free" manner.  You will never hear an announcer say, "If you missed yesterday's episode, don't bother watching today."  This is especially true of the news.  All stories are given in little snippets that are entirely self-contained, without any real background or context provided.  That would take way too much time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly:  Everything on television takes the form of entertainment.   From  Sesame Street  to the evening news, everything is a form of entertainment.  As our society has come to accept television as the standard mode by which we know the world, all other media have to change to mimick it.  For example, newspapers have shorter stories and more pictures, and a radio story would be considered very "in-depth" if it took ten full minutes to consider a single topic.  Most significantly, schools have to adapt to entertain their students.  Educational topics that can not be reduced to entertainment are not successfully taught.      On Politics   In a passage that presciently described the Clinton presidency:  If on television, credibility replaces reality as the decisive test of truth-telling, political leaders need not trouble themselves very much with reality provided that their performances consistently generate a sense of verisimilitude.  I suspect, for example, that the dishonor that now shrouds Richard Nixon results not from the fact the he lied but that on television he looked like a liar.  Which, if true, should bring no comfort to anyone, not even veteran Nixon-haters.  For the alternative possibilities are that one may look like a liar but be telling the truth; or even worse, look like a truth-teller but in fact be lying. [pg.&nbsp;102.]

       Trouble In Resolutionville   Well, we have some trouble here.  It is already the second day of my resolution to write for ten minutes, and I don't want to do it!  This means that I may just ramble on here with nothing at all to say.  That would not be good, since I really do have things to say.  I'm just too lazy to try to organize all of it.  Make that: I'm just too lazy to try to organize  any  of it.   Haikus About Work and Children   When Nathan wakes up  at one or two or three  he cries until  fed.   Work is great. My job  feeds my family. Reading  procedures is dull.   Amusing Ourselves To Death   I'm in the midst of a book with this title.  It is a frighteningly lucid description of the way television has shaped the way we look at the world.  The problem is not just the fact that people produce and broadcast bad TV shows.  It is fundamental to the way the medium works.  I will give a complete review when I'm done.

       New Year's Resolutions   It's resolution time!  This year's list is rather short.  My hope is that by keeping it small I might actually make some progress.             Do my best to leave work by 5:00 Pm.  Denise (that would be my beloved wife) said this is one of the best things I could do to help her in the new year.                  To do this successfully, I'll have to focus on leaving for work earlier and probably cutting down on lunches and coffees with friends.                    Spend at least 10 solid minutes a day writing.                  For a very long time I have felt that I just consume and absorb information without producing much of anything.  I  need  to have some outlet!  My writing can be in a journal, this blog, the back of an envelope,  anything,  as long as I'm writing.      A Week To Forget   This evening is the last night of a two-week break from work.  My most excellent employer, Guidant, has a company-wide shutdown from Christmas Eve through January&nbsp;1st.  This year they threw in January&nbsp;2nd as the floating holiday.  The result is that I could take two vacation days and get two weeks off.  Nothing to complain about in that, is there?  Now, the first week was great.  We had a very nice Christmas celebration.  But starting on the Friday after Christmas my kids started getting sick.  Soon, all four of them were down with the flu.  Shortly afterwards my wife got sick as well.  I can say that it could have been  much  worse.  We did not have the stomach flu, thank God.  But everyone was moping about, and there were several nights where I was awakened a number of times by children wanting to be comforted, or wanting to sleep in our bed, or wanting  water or medicine.  The sleep depravation was getting very severe.  But we have appeared to weathered it, with the only remaining symptoms being tiredness and slight lack of appetite.  The high fevers are a sad memory, and it looks like we are on the mend.  This ended up being one of those vacations which will make returning to work a very recuperative experience.

       The Religious Right as the "Other"   I was listening to public radio in the shower this morning.  There was a report on the controversy over sex education in the public schools.  The story told was that of how the "Religious Right" had been so effective over the past couple of decades at influencing the content of sex education courses.  Apparently, many of the more "progressive" sex education programs and educators are now on the defensive, with abstinence-only courses in the ascension.   Of course, the report was completely devoid of what I would consider substantive discussion.  It did not talk about the effectiveness of programs at curbing teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease.  I am not surprised that it did not give a full accounting of the questions that burn at the heart of the controversy, for these questions are deep and profound, and can not be reasonably presented in a three-minute report.  These questions regard the nature and meaning of sexuality.  And we can not seriously discuss the nature and meaning of sex without talking about the nature and meaning of being human.  It is frustrating, though, that there was not even the slightest hint of recognition that these issues are at the core.     The entire report was about the political action of the "Religious Right" and how it mobilized to counter many public school sex education programs.  The sense throughout, although you could tell the reporter was attempting to appear objective, was that conservatives were "other".  It was painfully obvious that the reporter was not speaking of something he knew,  or to which he could begin to relate.   Oops, I must go.  See you later.

       Reading    A Cry of Stone  by Michael O'Brien   This is another fantastic novel by Michael O'Brien.  If you have not already read his  Fr.&nbsp;Elijah , then stop reading here, go buy the book and read it.  It will be much better than anything I will ever write.    A Cry of Stone  is the latest book in the "Children of the Last Days" series.  It does something that I would have thought almost impossible before I read it:  It presents true poverty of spirit as something desirable and attractive.  O'Brien gives an account of the entire life of a poor (fictional) native woman from northern Canada.  Her name is Rose, and she has known great deprivation from her earliest memory.  The novel shows how God uses Rose in so many ways.  She is constantly aware of her weaknesses and smallness, but she just as constantly offers her entire self to the Lord.  It is an amazing book.    In the Fullness of Faith  by Von Balthazaar   A series of reflections on the "distinctively Catholic" elements of the Catholic Church.  Very insightful.

      The subject is babies that survive abortion attempts and are born alive. This quote is stunning in its callousness and depravity (emphasis is mine).   Professor Thornton, of City Hospital, Nottingham, [apparently channeling Satan directly] said: "Once it is born, you can't kill the baby but the law doesn't say anything about to what degree you resuscitate it.    "The way it is dealt with is by sensible doctors and sensible nurses keeping it under their hat and allowing the baby to pass away peacefully."    Professor Campbell does not believe that a baby born in this way should be kept alive at all costs.   "What paediatricians do is spend resources keeping a baby that is going to die, alive. It is absolute nonsense.  It does show that is up to us (obstetricians) to make sure the baby is not moving. "

      Today, has been a very difficult day to focus. I've been getting  far  too little sleep lately.  I find it curious that when I am extremely tired at work, I don't have a hard time staying awake or working with the computer.  The tiredness manifests itself in an inability (or at least unwillingness) to stay attentive to the task at hand.   When I am tired, I fiddle with my background image and cursors.  I adjust the sounds my computer makes for its default beep.  I repeatedly check e-mail, or see if there are new versions of utilities available for download.   I found it useful today to just spend the last hour of my time at work reading a new book on object-oriented programming.  I will be posting a more thorough later.  The book is by David West and titled   urlLink Object Thinking  .  I'm about halfway through it and am thoroughly enjoying it.   Rather than complain about lack of sleep, I best  head off to the land of Nod.  God bless you all.

       This book, by Marti Olsen Laney came very strongly recommend by a friend.  It's main point is that introversion is a personality type (one with many advantages), not a character defect.  It's All About Energy  An  introvert  is someone who gains energy by being alone or with one close friend in a quiet setting.  An  extrovert  is someone who gains energy by being with other people.  These definitions are very important.  Many people things being an introvert and being shy are the same thing, but introversion is not shyness.  Shyness is the feeling of anxiety caused by being in the presence of other people.  Both introvert and extroverts can be shy.  Olsen Laney makes the point that she is a social introvert.  She likes being with other people. She has always had jobs (librarian and therapist) that bring her into contact with many different people.  But such contact, even though enjoyable, is draining.  As an introvert she needs time alone to recharge.   Actually, It's All About  Me   I found the first part of the book to be especially useful.  She spends a good deal of time talking about characteristics of introverts, including common strengths and weaknesses.  A couple of her points really struck home.   Introverts often have a hard time starting tasks, because they feel they have to have very in-depth knowledge of a subject or problem before they can really tackle it.  This resonated with me very deeply.  I read this at a time when I was starting a new project at work and was having a very difficult time just getting going.  Realizing that this is a tendency common with my temperament freed me to put my hesitancy aside and do some initial work before I felt really comfortable doing so.  It was very freeing.   The concept of a "social introvert" really helped to explain some of my more puzzling reactions to situations.  I have come to understand that feeling drained and worn out after a social event does not mean the event was a failure or that something was wrong with me.  It is simply part of my introverted personality.   Has It Changed My Life Forever?  No.  The book is very good, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is an introvert or lives with one. But it was not as life-changing (at least for me) as some of the reviews seem to imply.   The first part of the book (which explains the main concepts, talks about the physiological brain mechanisms underlying the temperament, and provides insight into common characteristics, problems and strengths of introverts) was very useful.  However, the last part of the book is an extended discussion of coping mechanisms that introverts can use to deal with the extroverted culture in which we live.  I don't know if I'm just not that introverted or if I'm old enough to have figured out how to deal with most of these situations on my own.  The last section was not very helpful, and I found myself skimming the last third of the book rather than reading it thoroughly.

      This  urlLink rather sarcastic satire  from the Most Excellent ScrappleFace was depressingly echoed (albeit seriously) in  urlLink this article   from the Minneapolis Star Tribune.   I was very tempted to post both articles side-by-side on the exterior of my cube at work, but I feared it might prove to be a CLM (career-limiting move).

      My dear wife, Denise (actually, she's my only wife),  and I were at a conference for Catholic Homeschoolers this weekend.  The conference started on Friday night, and Denise took our four children to meet me at St.&nbsp;Thomas University (the conference's location) after work.  As Denise was getting the children out of the car, another car pulled up to hers and a family composed two adults and one small child stepped out.   The mother looked at our van-load of four children and started to remark how amazing it was that we had such a large family.  She repeatedly complimented Denise at her ability to handle so many children.  She said several times that she had no idea how Denise could keep up with them.  She said she could hardly handle the one little boy they had.  She even gave our oldest soon (who was on the threshold of turning three years old) a tennis ball.   She was very kind, and I very much appreciate the fact that she was trying to be encouraging.  But it saddens me that a family with four children should inspire such awe.  Yes, they're a handful, but children are also an amazing  gift .  We don't stand in awe of people who work weekends and evenings to get a promotion or raise.  We recognize that they are making an investment in what they believe to be important.  Well, in being open to having and raising these children we are investing in what we believe to be tremendously more important than any promotion or raise could ever be.
