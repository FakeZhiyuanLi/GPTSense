      couple of things I want to jot down: David acknowledged our love-hate relationship.  He called me his "arch-nemi-friend"  and the other day reinforced it.  He told me he fixed the turbo on his car with the help of his father in law.  I asked why he didnt call me, he said because he/we/i was mad at each other.  I felt relieved to know that that shit wasnt all in my head.  We get along pretty good sometimes.  The other day was really good.  We were working/slacking off together all day.  We caught up on a whole bunch of shit that has been going on and had some good laughs and fun.  I was so pissed when I realized I was going out of town this weekend.  I was really excited about Yael moving back.  I started to plan to be in Austin when she first drove in.  But then it hit me.  I am going to be out of town.  I will see her as soon as I can.  I am so glad that things are better/back to normal between us.  They were pretty bad... and it was really wearing on me.  She means a lot to me.  More than I want to admit.  And I have invested a lot into this relationship.  And I am not giving up that easily.  I really think that we have a happy future together.  I cant wait to see her again.  Mary?  The last thing I needed from her was my key.  Which I checked into myself and found that she didnt have it.  So that should be the end of that.  We have nothing connecting us.  Just a vegabond of a friendship

      Lastnight was not good.  Have you ever been in doubt about the one thing you were so sure of?  It fucking sucks.  I don't know what or who to believe in now.  It seems like everything is fucked up.  Everything has been brought into question.  This is exactly why I moved my faith into machines a long time ago.  Humans are just to coplicated.  In a machine, if it stops running, there is a reason.  And with a little wrench time and new parts its running again.  But when people break or do something completly unexpected, only that same person knows the reason for thier actions.  What they say is wrong is exactly that.  It is what they want you to believe.  Maybe it is true, maybe its not... But there is usually alot more to it that what is said.  Stupid humans.  They themselves complicate the simplest most trivial matters.  Machines are free of emotions and feelings.  It is never going to stop working cause you looked at it funny.  Or you came in this morning and didnt say hello.  Stupid humans.  And its compounded by the fact that I let this person in.  I let them into my world.  And this is what they choose to do to me.  This is why there is no one in my world.  No mother, no father, no sister nor brother.  Friends?  I can count them with one hand.  And I keep a close eye on thier actions and words.  Trust, but verify.  That is what I now live by.  So what will result of all of this?  I'm as eager as Yael is to find that out.  You know, I have been thru this before with Yael.  Right before I went to visit her in February.  She did something very similar to this.  This time was worse, I can not believe how badly I wanted to get off of the phone yesterday after hearing all of that.  I just wanted to hang up the phone and run.  Run far away from all of it.  I was laying there in pieces when she called back.  Every ring of the phone stung my ears.  I curled up in bed and wished the ringing to stop.  It did, or maybe I fell asleep, or both.  I woke up very exausted.. I found my phone and saw a voice mail waiting.  Should I check it?  I did.  It was Yael.  So I immediatly call her.  She does some explaining, I do a lot of listening.  And now I do a lot of thinking.  It seems like she is afraid.  I did not know that I had such an effect on her.  But does the negative effects out weigh the positive ones?    Is she better off without me?  *sigh*  I feel like I have nothing.

      Yep.  I talked to her today.  Another instant argument over some stupid shit.  A few hours pass, and she calls.  She apologizes and shortly there after another argument arises.  This time I just hang up the phone.  I don't need that shit.  It is so fucking stupid. Grrrrrrrrr *phone rings*  Great..  its her.. .  She wants to take me lunch tomorrow, and apologizes again.  She needs professional help.

      If there is a finite number of sounds that can be made and heard,  but an infinite number of combonations.  Then is it only a matter of time before you hear just about everything*  (to a certain extent, I know the combonations can be long and infinite, but lets not get out of hand)  What was I talking about?   Anyway.. . Although me and Yael talk to each other practically everyday,  it is never a dull moment.  Just the other day we went on an interesting tangent.  We had a conversation by spelling everything we said.  It was nerdy, and geeky, but a lot of fun.  I gotta run.. . i think "the man" is watching me... .

      Yael told me I was her best friend.  It totally blind sided me.  I didn't know what to say.  I had never thought about her that way.  And I don't use those words lightly (best friend).  She already means a whole lot to me.. .  and now I feel more secure about her.  I feel like she will always be a part of my life.  I am no longer worried about her just leaving.  I have always felt a little insecure about that.  The distance has always been an issue, and I never thought we could manage it as well as we have.  I also know that her family has a very strong influence on her.  So should they ever decide remove me from her life, I knew they would succeed.  I think I get along well with them.  I also felt that she is still young and may change on me.  She is also continuing her education.  Although not certain about a career, she wants to do great things with her life.  And I can't interfere with that.  I won't.  I will make sure that I never hold her back from the pursuit of her dreams.. .  Even if it means I can't see her anymore.  I realize I am somewhat of a slacker.. .  but I am out to change that.   See that shit?  She inspires and motivates me to do better!  I love her.  She is my best friend.  Yael

      LOL  fucking looser ass Spurs.. . All they lack is the ability to score.. .  Kinda like me! ROFL  but with me there is only one girl I want to score with.  Another sunday.. . I feel lazy.  I see my borther and his family at my house and I feel I feel. .. how can I describe it? its not good, nor bad, not happy or sad.  I guess I don't like them.  He is not so bad but he does pass judgement on me regularly.  Which I despise.  And so I like to be transparent when he is around.  I often wait until he leaves before I will come out of my room.  BLah.. .  I need to clean my room.  Yael is going to be here soon and it is a mess.  *sigh*  I miss her.  I miss her soooo much.  The flower she gave me is loosing its scent.  Shit i need to get out of here.. .

      Damnit! Why does shit have to be this way! Why! What the fuck did I do?  I thought I was doing everything right this time!  Maybe I was just too late.  Late again.  That is so fucking ironic.  Right after that happened, a picture of Ruby appears.  Not magically, mind you, but in an old ass roll of film that I just developed a few days ago.  Why! Why is it that when I finally get the balls to commit to someone I get shot down.  Like I am too late.  Relationships are very serious things to me.  I don't just jump into any ol' relations with someone I don't love or someone I am not 100% sure of.  That shit hurts when it doesn't work so yes I am going to be extra fucking careful.  I am not into making the same mistakes.  And now I am in an uncomfortable situation.  I got shot down by the one friggin person that I am so in love with, Yael.  I am not saying that all hope is lost.  But now Pirscilla has jumped in there.  She really likes me, but I dont want to be with her.  When I am out with Pirscilla, she tires to get close, but it makes me uncomfortable.  It feels like I am cheating on Yael.  Fuck! this sucks!   This is all in my head.  Ouside of my head the weather is fine.  Happy smiling people are everywhere.  Yael is out there, happy and doing her own thing.  And me?  I sit here with my thoughts.  Round and round they go.    I take Yael very seriously.. . and I am starting to think that maybe I shouldn't anymore.  Maybe we are not on the same page anymore.    But I still love her.  *sigh*

      Well I didn't think she was like that.. . Everything I have heard from her told me otherwise.  And that is what really attracted me to her.  But now I know that is not true.  And where does that leave me?  Has all of the time and effort that I invested in that relationship gone to shit?  This sucks.  But it just proves my "unamed theory" about relationships and life and maturity.  I can say that I still feel the same about her.  But I have always felt uncomfortable when I am with other girls.  A feeling like I am cheating on Yael.  We are both offically "single".  Maybe I should start acting like it?  Who would have thought that all of this shit would surface after one drunken night of girl on girl action.  LOL

      Yael!   I am so worried about you right now.  Ever since last night when you told me that you had something to tell me in person.  I was barely able to sleep.  I was talking with Priscilla for a long ass time about it.  She kept telling me to just go (lastnight) so I could get it over with.  But I didn't want to be all tired today during work.  LOL I'm tired anyway! I should have just gone, but I wasn't sure if that would be ok with you.  And I didn't feel comfortable calling you back.  I kinda seemed like you didn't want to talk to me... Oh man I felt so shitty hearing your voice yesterday.  I know there is something on your mind, and you just wouldn't say.  And that kills me.  And that makes me feel like you have something bad to tell me.  But what could it be?   I feel the stress and anxiety throughout my body.    I keep telling myself that there will be a positive outcome regardless of what you tell me.  But deep down I know there are things that you could say that would end my world as I know it.  *tears buildup*  You mean the world to me.  But all I can do is wait.  Yael, please please lets talk today!  Just let me know if I can see you today and I will.  Peeeeeease!!!!!!   *sigh* -Roberto

      Man, it kinda feels like I got yelled at on Sunday! I just wanted to see Yael, but I guess it was a little too early form them.  And that is the other thing about Yael.  Her family.  Her family plays a big part in he life.  Very unlike my own family.  That is not a bad thing, but it adds another variable to the equation.  For example: I had told her awhile back about going to a concert with her on Sunday.  Then right after getting yelled at about the morning thing she tells me she cant go.  Going to be doing some family stuff (church, lunch, blah).  That doesn't kill me, but it sucks.  Like I said, it (he family)is another variable that I have absolutely no control over which at any given moment will immediately change everything and anything.  I'm really starting to feel kinda of unsure about her.  I think we are on the same page (love), but she has quite a few limits and restrictions on what she can do.  Which makes me a little sad.  I just wonder if things will ever change.  Shit I need to stop thinking about all of that and be more patient.  *sigh*

      Yesterday was a very watery day in San Antonio.  Flooding all over the place.  My five minute drive home turned into twenty!  Once home we switched vehicles and proceeded to our final destination with ease: The Gentleman's Club.  LOL  Yes sir, in the middle of all of this flooding and fury, team smart decides to there!  Braving the elements for bare breasts!  It was a nice place, but the same ol' nasty girls.  We tried to invite Ed,  our elderly salesman, but he couldn't make it.  LOL that would have been funny.  What was funny was that I left my wallet there! LOL I wasnt even drunk!  Everything falls out of those shorts! I swear! LOL  Anyway...  . I get home later and talk to Yael.  I get really sleepy and start saying crazy shit.  LOL It is wierd how I am aware that I am saying some incoherent ass shit, but I cant stop it.  LOL But before that, I really felt something talking to Yael.  It was like I felt the Love.  I could almost feel her presence in the room.  I really hope I can get to spend more time with her soon.

      Another soggy day in the Alamo City, it's soggier than yesterday.  But yesterday was alot of fun.  I went to Austin to see Yael.  I was just planning on watching "Iron Fist Pillage" with her, but they had other plans for me.  LOL  We (her family) went roller skating.  I haven't been to a skating rink in over five years.  It was so much fun! I wish I had brought my own skates though, those house skates sucked.  I tried the quads at first, but I did'nt feel good on them, I am used to inline skates.  I only fell once.  And that I blame on my shitty ass skates.  The front wheel almost came off!  It was that loose!  But anyway, it was fun.  Hanging out with her family wasn't that bad either.  I'm not sure if they like or approve of me, but I know that they don't dislike me.  At least I hope so! LOL  I think Yael enjoyed the movie too.  I know I enjoyed her company.  But a couch would be nice.  That seat thing is not comfortable, and the floor isn't any better.  It was a good night.  When I got back home, I was a bit suprised that Mary didn't call me.  She is either calling me every half-hour to talk about bullshit or ask me for something, or not calling for days or weeks at a time.  She is really starting to fade out of my life, which is a very good thing.  She has changed so much since we met.  If I would have met her today, I wouldn't want to date her.  You know, I worry about Yael doing the same to me.  I guess it is like "out growing" each other...   blah

      Yep, another dose of mis-fortune for Mary lastnight.  Some people shot at her rear window while driving back to San Antonio from Corpus Christi.  The window didnt shatter cause of the tint, and they shot at her with a pellet gun.  She called the police and they were arrested.  Someone has a voodoo doll of Mary. LOL  She has some bad karma or mojo or whatever floating around her.    And then there is Yael.  Things are starting to get.. . well I dont know. .. how can I describe it?  It is furstrating, having something so beautiful, pure, innocent, so far away.  I mean she is closer now, but just out of squeezing range.  And I like squeezing her.  I love her, and I hate the fact that I cant see her everyday.  I need more patience.  And I thought I was a patient person!  But sometimes I wonder if things will ever change.  Her family needs her.  She needs to get back in school.  And she needs to get a job.  It makes me wonder if she will have enough time for me.  I have always wondered about this:  urlLink Google Answers: Why is the sky blue?

      she told me yesterday that it was not fair to either of us to be friends, because she is dating someone else.  i wish her the best with that.  and i'm sorry i wasn't good enough.  i tried my best, but i hesitated to get with her.  and she started to have doubts about us. .. and now here we are.  or i should say here i am.  I enjoyed every minute I spent with her.  And I think she did too.  I won't ever forget any of the awesome times we shared.  I will always love her.  She never did anything to hurt me.  I hope that maybe she just needs some time to herself to realize what we have.  And some time to get out there and be free.  How can you know good from bad without expierencing both?  It is the same with right and wrong.  The one thing about all this that I don't like is that she still thinks that Mary is still apart of my life.  She was in the begining, but she isnt anymore.  And another thing! If we were such good friends, why the fuck did I never her about her meeting this fucker? huh? FUCK THAT!  I told all the shit that is going on in my life.  good, bad, all of it!  I told her about mary! i told her about pirscilla!  did she tell me about him?  not until it was too late.  fuck!

      Why the hell do I always loose sight of my plans and goals?  Then I end up where I am now.  Lost.  I wonder what the fuck am I supposed to be doing.  Is what I am doing right now what I should be doing?  Round and round we go.  I think what happend is that a big part of my plan changed on me.  Yep.  Yael.  And the best part is that she doesnt even know it!  Maybe I should have learned this lesson already.  Dont make anyone apart of your plan.    *sigh*  And now the boss is yelling at me.  Great.  Just great.  Maybe the weather will stay nice today so I can ride later.  That soothes me.  And now stupid Pirscilla is sending text messages to my phone.  Almost as if nothing happened the other day.  Fuck that!  I am not getting tangled up in that shit.  Fucking Leo.  I wonder if my face is going to be scared.  I keep forgeting that I am bruised up pretty good.  People give me wierd looks.  I guess it does look like I was in a fight or something.  At least it is already Wednesday.  Just two more days.  I can make it.  Two more days then I can sleep.  Mmmmmm sleep.  I think I will get my ass back in school.  Yep.

      Damn I feel disoriented.  I feel like I may have lost what I was living for.  And I was sooo careful with her.  Sooo patient.  Soooo honest.  Dont go telling anyone this, but I did a lot for her.  When shit would get me down, my thoughts of her would pick me right back up.  I felt like I could make it thru whatever because I knew that someday we will be together.  But now it seems like we are getting further apart from each other.  I asked her why she did not want to be with me (bf/gf)   And here is the list she came up with: 1. Distance (duh) 2. Not ready          needs to get settled          needs transportation          not sure about me anymore                   has doubts                   trust issues                   insecurity  about the way I feel about her (i think)  And that sucks.  That fucking sucks!  It is all my fault.  But it is not the end of the world.  But is it the end of our world?  Is our comfy apartment where we watch southpark gone?  I don't know.  But I do know where I stand.  I love her.  And that stung me, but I smiled.  I smiled because maybe she wasn't happy with me, and she is breaking away to be happy.  And that is why I smile.  Because now she will be happier.  Even if it is without me.  As long as she is happy.  I tried.  I really tried my bestest with her.  And I can accept that I made mistakes.  Some which cannot be mended.  But here is where the irony of my life strikes: I dont think pirscilla wants to talk to me anymore.  She said I kept talking about Yael!  And that she knows that I love Yael and that she cant compete with that.    What could I say?  It is true.  I dont see Pirscilla as a romantic interest.  A friend, yes.  More? nope.  I know exactly how I feel.  And it may not matter anymore.  But shit life isn't all smiles and giggles.  I need a hug.
