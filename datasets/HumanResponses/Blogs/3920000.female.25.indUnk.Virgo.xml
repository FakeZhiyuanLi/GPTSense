      &nbsp;&nbsp; Today is just another day,&nbsp;&nbsp; or is it?&nbsp; Is today the day the war is ended?&nbsp; Is today the day you get the phone call saying that someone you love has been seriously injured,&nbsp; or just won the Publishers Clearing House 100,000 dollar prize?&nbsp; Crazy, I know,&nbsp; but my point is that every day we get up and start the day the same way we did yesterday and the same way we will tomorrow.&nbsp; Does anyone else ponder these things on a daily basis or am I just a thinker?&nbsp; I think about these things because in&nbsp;a weird way, I kinda like the idea that we will never know what the day holds.&nbsp; I am not one of the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on horoscopes ( though I get a kick out of them)&nbsp; and 99 cnts. a minute phone calls to a psychic to determine what my day holds.&nbsp; I would rather live the day and see what it brings, not try to figure out what the day will bring in order to live my day.&nbsp; To you these are probably just random thoughts, but to me, they are me.&nbsp; Things that go through my head on a daily basis.&nbsp; I guess I just wanted to finally say some of&nbsp; it outloud.

        THEY TOLD ME I WAS STUBBORN,  THEY SAID I'D NEVER DO.   THEY SAT ME IN THE CORNER, ONLY TO SIT ME NEXT TO YOU.  VENGEFULL EYES OF FURY,  A HEART SO FULL OF RAGE.  ONLY A HAND OF WISDOM COULD HELP ME TURN THE PAGE.  I SEE A NEW ASSURANCE,  IN THE LIFE THAT I HAVE FOUND,  LEAVING THE WEATHER BEATEN ONE LYING ON THE GROUND.  A STRANGE NEW PEACE HAS FILLED ME,  A CALMNESS ALL ITS OWN.   IT SEEMS SOMEHOW THROUGH YOU, I HAVE ACTUALLY GROWN.  ME AS A PERSON AND ME AS A WHOLE, ME THIS NEW BEING HAS FOUND A BRAND NEW GOAL.  I WILL BE WHAT I NEED TO AND I WILL BE WHAT IS TRUE, I WILL BE WHATEVER IT IS THAT IS NEEDED BY YOU.  I'LL LOVE YOU THROUGH ALL LIFE AND I'LL LOVE YOU THROUGH ALL PAIN. I'LL LOVE YOU IN THE SUNSHINE,  AND EVEN MORE IN THE RAIN.               FOR MY SON- HAYDEN          by sarah wagner
