        May 12, 2004....   Seven Feathers... and milepost 88.6  Gordonl, Darrell, Chellie, Me... Kendra, Cari, Natalie and Sammie...   all going back.  Back to a lost time and back to a lost friend.  Each had a "moment" in mind.  Each having something to say.. some could not say.  Meeting again... Faces full of excitement and angst.  Sooo LONG AGO..  the jolt of hearts  pounding within.  The never ending.. feeling of life and anticipation.  For hours drinking coffee, warm Hamm's or Old Englishe... Together.. the five.  Back again. For You! No Hamm's.  Standing before this spot.  A spot that was chosen to mark your life, Your loss.   The kids chose not to stand at this spot.  They walked on.  The youth and determination you once had - forcing them down the highway. They were driven to prove the toasts and tears were given at the wrong location.   They walk south - slowly.  Talking, remembering... searching as you would have... to be right.   It is my belief... there is a marker on the roadside that marks your life.  Before the end.  The life that was filled with EATING .... bratwurst and froot loops, writing and sharing, and loving each other.    For you.  We came together again.  For you... our own RAD.  The four remaining of the five, plus one.  We all went to that place we all called friendship, and love.  You brought us back.  I know that makes you happy.  And that is all that anyone has anymore.  The thoughts, feelings, writings etc, that comprised our RAD.  What one knows with no doubt to be YOU.  To reach out and cherish that which would have made you laugh, to love to live.  That makes me smile.

         December 17, 2003  As night fell I waited. I was not sure if you were going to show or not.  I had come to accept the growing distance.   That sometimes you would walk through the door. ... and others you were walking through in thought.     We had discussed it before, remember... ??   What to do if..  You said... "If the cops show up and ask where I was.. I was here with you..."    We were together officer, you must be mistaken.    December 17, 2003  9:00pm ish.  I was upstairs, reading or watching tv.  Dozing nonetheless...  Kendra came in.. "Mom... there is a cop downstairs for you!"  she said with a certain panic.  That same panic overtook my mind.  Uh oh.. what did he want?... The kids, Ron... A complaint?... Hmmm...  As I stepped closer to the door... The aura struck me hard.  I felt it..even before I knew it.  I stepped slowly .. one frozen step at a time...   "Does Ron Doer live at this address?" ...   uh oh.. we were together officer - rushes to the forefront of my mind, ...   "Yes.."       "... well, there is no easy way to put this" he said towering above my 5'3" frame in his blue uniform...   FREEZE... he was here!... We were together.  He SAID we were together!...the room is spinning but the officer stands still...   what?...   "Ron was killed in a car wreck on I-5 tonight."   FREEZE... WHAT?  It can't be true because we were here at home together.  here!..   "It happened at milepost 88.6.  He went very quickly."    HE WENT WHERE???? HE WAS HERE!!!!...   "Do you have the phone numbers for any of his family members?"    His FAMILY!  Oh, God!.. his family.  Sammie... oh Sammie... Your Daddy is gone!  ....   Suddenly... isolated moments of time, images of you... go flashing and bouncing in and out of my mind.  frame by freeze frame... your smile, your laugh, your creaking knees.. your hair... your eyes.  your tears...    YOUR TEARS >>>  How sad you were.  I wish I could go back to that night you sat at the radio.. "Every Breath you Take" remake by P. Diddy... Tears and sorrow, terrible pain.  You needed a hug... I am so sorry.  I was afraid!  I was afraid, but I don't know exactly why.  Maybe because your pain was so deep I could feel it from where I stood, yards away... and to get closer.. Maybe it felt like I  would lose that small grasp I had on "?"... my own emotions.  It was not long before this that you had come and drawn me out of my room.  Away from the emptiness and lonliness of my own loss.  Away from the void I created for myself.  I walk repeatedly past the stereo.. you there on the floor, your arm reaching up to replay the song.. the sound of your voice quaking from the pain.  And, just as you replayed the song, now I replay that moment.  The moment I went upstairs instead of towards my friend.  Please forgive me.. I now know what it is like to need a hug - and not have the friend there to give it.     I miss you terribly!.. I am sorry I did not understand just how much you missed Crystal... I never lost someone I loved as deeply and purely as I love(d) you.  "I wish I weren't alive" you said...  as I watched your pain.. I asked you.. "and what about the rest of us?.. Then we can sit and feel the way you feel?!.."   "What?.. no one would miss me if I was not here... no one would cry for me!" was your response.    At first.. I admit... I did not really feel like crying.  I had watched your broken spirit suffer such agony.  I had actually prayed to God, that He RELEASE YOU FROM THE PAIN  Then my thoughts went to Gwen... Just a baby.  How would she recover from this?  She was already fragile.  You were trying to build her up.. give her confidence.  Teaching her to drive.  Giving her the experiences most 17 year olds have and take for granted. Your spirit so loving.  Forever helping those who needed... Gwen, Tyler, Myself.  How would you help her through this Ron?.. I know you would be so angry at the mere hint there would be any charges whatsoever! You would stand up and insist she has suffered enough. You would not be hushed, but get louder!   Oh Gwen!... Please don't blame yourself!.. There is nothing you could have done!... It was an         . I pray you find peace in knowing .. that our friend has gone home.. where he REALLY WANTED TO BE!... If you knew his heart and loved him... you would understand what you need to do.    LIVE>    I know.  RAD was a hypocrite.  You live, while I die.     For now..   the moment stops here....  > urlLink     urlLink  Click Here        > urlLink     urlLink  Click Here

      December 18, 2003  Springfield man killed in crash    A D V E R T I S E M E N T   All State Real Estate VIEW FULL AD         AZALEA -- A Springfield man was killed in a collision on Interstate 5 near Milepost 88 Wednesday afternoon.  Ronald Allen Doer, 33 , was a passenger in a 1986 four-door Honda Accord driven by Gwen x, 17, of Roseburg.   At about 8:20 p.m., the southbound Honda passed a 2003 Freightliner tractor-trailer driven by Clarence , 64, of Central Point, and went out of control, according to an Oregon State Police release.  The Honda struck the guardrail and angled off into the front axle of the semitruck. The Honda was dragged underneath for several hundred feet, the report states, before the commercial vehicle could come to a stop.   Doer, who was wearing a seat belt, was declared      at the scene.  Hull, who suffered minor injuries, was cited for driving under the influence of intoxicants and additional charges are pending.  A second passenger, Reed  17, of Glide, was taken to Three Rivers Hospital in Grants Pass for a broken foot, according to OSP. The hospital nursing supervisor said this morning she did not have a record of Reed, who was not wearing a seat belt, being admitted.   The incident remains under investigation.

      I remember sitting in front of the computer last December 9.... you were behind me in Bill's "Antique LazyBoy.." eating fruity pebbles (your favorite)... You had been asking me to type up your poems... and so we finally sat down to do it.. we typed the Happy Holidays, and then Hello Again, and Nothing Left.  I enjoyed going over the words with you, perfecting your projected imagry.  I may be slow, but here they are.  Finally. I am sharing them on this site because they are awesome.  They show just a small piece of your heart.. that was so big.  Here are your words.      Hello Again  I never really said good-bye  Cause I couldn't watch you leave  I wish you could've known  What you meant to me.  You filled my heart so full of love  More than I dreamed it could be   Being here without you  I'm a man without a home  Standing in a desert  Lost and so alone  I need to hear your voice  For, it's like water to my soul  Which is dying from dehydration  From a love I'll never know   You were the light  That was in my life  Without you  There's darkness all around  I'm finally so far lost  That people think I'm found   They tell me that I'm coping well  With my greatest loss  Can't they tell  That I'm in Hell  And what part of me it cost   I don't care if they don't know  That they're too blind to see  To them I'll always be "friend"  But, I'll never again be me   I need to hear  From you my friend  Two simple words  ..Hello Again.    Nothing Left   Why can't I ever be  "the one that wins it all"?  It seems I only live  to see how far I'll fall.   I think I'm getting close  To finally moving on,  I feel life draining out of me,  And don't care that it is gone.   The road we travel on  Death is sure and slow  But I am driving recklessly,,  So sooner I will go.   You see, I challenge all the      s  And the wrath of Hell  To kill the very soul in me  Kill and kill it well.   There is no light ahead of me  It's somewhere left behind.  Looking in my mirror  there's no me that I can find.   This world keeps spinning forward  Not the world in which I live  For I stopped living in it...  When I had nothing left to give.    Your World   Carried in the gusty wind  Those voices from the past  Pain from being your only friend  For friendships do not last.   The voices echoe inside your mind  you think you still can hear.  These silent sounds bring friends to sight  Even though there's no one is near.   Shadows move across darkened walls  The ghosts are finally real  No one hears your desperate calls  Or knows the way you feel.   You built a world all your own  Your life's not part of life  Things are different than they seem,  In darkness you found light.   You live a life that is not real  Deep inside your mind  That's where you have to go  To keep the friends you find.   There is no wind in the past,  It's where you'll always be  No voice behind these padded walls  Locked up safe and free.   Memories are what you use  To live your life today  Where everyone had to go,  You know I couldn't stay.   You kept the spoken promises  that were always made  Empty words of innocence  Were never meant to fade

      Happy Holidays   Dear Old Saint Nicholas,  I hope I'm not too old to write to you,  But Christmas is coming quickly now,  And I know not what to do.   You see I'm all alone  Faith and Hope have been destroyed  So I am not a man no more,  I'm just a little boy  I  I'm scared and all alone  In a world I don't really like  Don't think that I am wishing for  Gifts like a puppy or a bike   It's said you're full of miracles  I need one over here  Cause she's been      now,  for almost one full year.   I try to hide the crying,  I can not stop the pain  But I don't think that anyone knows  That I've slowly gone insane   I know you think I'm selfish  But I might not see come light,  So I guess I should be first  When you go out on Christmas night.   If you wonder if I've been good...  My whole life I've been nice...  Even times when I did bad  So before you decide - think twice.   Santa can you change my heart?  And what I'm going to do?  Or come on Christmas morning,  Will it be that I'm      too    Ronald Allen Doer  May 12, 1970-December 17, 2003  Your wish has been granted.
