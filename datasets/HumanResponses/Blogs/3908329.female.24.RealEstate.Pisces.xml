      The following is an event that happened to me about 4 years ago.  It's all true. I actually wrote this about two years ago for a class and as I was clearing out some old stuff I came across it and thought I would post it. I cut some stuff out... just because I don't care to recall all the details.  I changed the names, except the security guards and the dude.  I left his name because I refuse to protect him and his sick ass mind.       I was somewhere between being asleep and awake.  That place where you can hear what is going on around you but it all seems surreal.  In my languid state, I slowly realized I was not in my own bed but in the suite of the 14-room  urlLink resort  which had become my home since landing in Jamaica three days earlier.  I stretched and for a last few glorious minutes, savored the warm sea breeze caressing my bare legs.  I finally pulled myself out of bed and padded out onto the tiled veranda just like I had every morning since my arrival in Negril.  As I leaned on the weathered patio railing, I could make out the silhouettes of the early morning fishermen against the seemingly endless sea.  Even at 7:00 in the morning, the air was warm and thick with the saltiness from the ocean.  I was relishing this time alone to connect with the island of my heritage and think about what it must have been like for my parents to grow up there.  In the distance, I could hear the natives starting their day; the sound of cars being started and zipping by, a friendly “Good morning!” or “Wa a gwan?” being called out to one another.  Even the animals seemed to have woken up.  The birds were chirping and the mosquitoes were buzzing.  I loved how each morning this scene played out only slightly different than the day before.  I didn’t know then how different that day would turn out to be.                I was mentally going through what was planned for the day when I finally went back into the room to wake up my boyfriend, Aaron.  After the inevitable groans against having to wake up, he finally sat up and strode over to the balcony much the way I had a few minutes before that.  I went downstairs to check if my friend Marissa had woken up yet.  She had and was busy picking her outfits for the day.  Our excitement about the trip was obvious in our giddy conversation about which part of the seven-mile-long, white, sandy beach we were going to sample next. The place was pretty deserted since we decided to go during the off- season to save money.  There was one other room being used by Jim; an outwardly friendly guy, your “everyday Joe” from Milwaukee, WI.  He was about 45 with salt-and-pepper hair and an average build.  Jim told us he had a job dealing with the internet, was unmarried, gay, and did not get along with his family.  He had checked in the day before, and since then had become fast friends with Marissa.  I didn’t really like him when I met him.  Some may call it instinct or intuition, but something just was not right.  He wasn’t rude or obnoxious but there was something about him that I did not trust.  We were all dressed and on our way out the door when we bumped into Jim.  Immediately, I had that feeling like my skin was crawling.  “So where are you guys headed?” he called from his balcony. Marissa was the first to reply, “Oh, we’re just going to get breakfast and then we’re hittin’ the beach.”   Aaron and I continued walking like we hadn’t heard him address us at all.  Marissa invited Jim along with us for the day, which he all too eagerly accepted.  But for some reason, I did not voice my trepidation.  I thought that maybe Marissa wanted Jim to join us so she wouldn’t feel like a “third wheel”.  Thus, I tolerated his presence out of respect for my friend’s judgement and possible loneliness. After breakfast, we all decided to walk about two miles down the road to Rick’s Café in lieu of the beach.  We bargained with hagglers along the way and I shared my knowledge of the island, the language, and the culture that I had learned from my family.  Once we got to Rick’s, Marissa and I started drinking some fruity, frozen, rum concoction the bartender had whipped up for us and Aaron was videotaping the tourists jumping into the sea from the cliffs.  I was vaguely aware of Jim lurking in the background watching us but I was too caught up in the excitement of the place to pay much attention to him.  A few hours later, as we were enjoying the live entertainment, Jim showed up with drinks in hand for all of us.  “They are having a two for one special at the bar!  I got you guys a drink for inviting me out with you today.” We accepted without question.  That was the mistake that would change my life forever.  Somewhere in the back of my mind I wondered why he just bought us a drink without asking us what kind we wanted.  But, I pushed that thought out and replaced it with reason.  I figured he was out with us all day and was normal, no one else seemed to have a problem with him, and I am on vacation and need to loosen up.  My logic was wrong.  We had already returned to our suite when Marissa realized we were all acting strangely.  We were laughing hysterically at everything from the chairs to the pictures on the walls and Jim was taping all of this.  It wasn’t until Marissa tried to put Jim out the room and he wouldn’t leave that anything seemed amiss to me.  It was obvious to Marissa, however, that we had been drugged.   Marissa yelled, “What did you do to us?  What did you put in our drinks?”  When he didn’t answer I realized she had hit the nail on the head.  I noticed that Aaron was passed out on the bed, but I couldn’t move.  I had no control of my limbs.  I could taste my tears but I could not feel them rolling down my cheeks.  Marissa was frantically trying to get him to leave as I watched on in horror, unable to help.   Jim yelled something unintelligible to Marissa and I saw the most sadistic, mocking sneer on his face.  Amazingly, throughout all of this, he never stopped filming what was happening.   Somehow, Marissa made it over to the window and desperately called for Alex and Zuki, the security guards.   Her voice was penetratingly wretched as she cried out for help.  When Jim heard our protectors coming, he finally put down the camera and left our room.  I could see Marissa crying and pulling the tape out of the camera and destroying it but I was still paralyzed.   As immobile as my body was, my mind was ten times the opposite. If Jim came back, would we have been able to defend ourselves?  Would Zuki and Alex be able to protect us?  Would I ever feel safe again? In the midst of these thoughts, I did the only thing I could do.  I prayed. I felt intense relief when at last Zuki and Alex made it to our room and asked what happened.  I heard Marissa explaining, but to me it all sounded like a buzz.  I could decipher Zuki telling her not to worry because he and Alex would be up all night keeping guard.  They assured us that in the morning they would ask Jim to leave.  Jim did try to come back to our room that night, but when he saw Zuki, he said he just wanted his camera.  Marissa gave it to Zuki and that is the last thing I remember about that night.  Aaron doesn’t remember any of it.  Marissa won’t talk about it. The next day, Jim checked out on his own.  He went to Zuki and confessed that he had done something terrible and he had to leave.  Zuki told us when they checked his room they found notes he wrote in journal format.  In his haste to leave, he forgot to take them, along with a few other minor things.  The notes were about us.  He wrote about watching us change through the shuttered windows to our room.  He wrote about how he planned to drug us and record himself violating us.   Jim was gone but the fear he triggered wasn’t.  For the rest of the trip, I found myself constantly looking over my shoulder and being suspicious of everyone.   We took turns sleeping and listened out for any new noise.  Thankfully, Zuki and Alex kept their promise and stayed up every night from then on watching and protecting.  I will always be grateful to them. In Jamaica there is a saying, “Always follow your first mind.” I wonder what would have happened if I had followed my initial feelings.  I wonder what would have happened if Marissa had not had the whereabouts to get Jim out of our room.  Would we still be here?  Would I be writing this?  Maybe, maybe not.  I can’t dwell on it for too long though.  I just try to forget that day and night.  I dwell on the other parts of the trip; the parts that were good.  I have closed off that experience.  Maybe at a later date I will be able to make peace with what took place.  For now, I am content to forget it ever happened.

      Respect is a very relevant part of any relationship.&nbsp; I expect my friends to respect my decisions, even if they don't necessarily agree with them.&nbsp; Obviously if I am doing something crazy or harmful to myself,&nbsp; I would want someone to intervene but as far as personal choices that are my own choices,&nbsp; state your opinion then fall back.&nbsp; Last night I was on the phone with my long long time friend and she asked me how was church going.&nbsp; Now I thought this was a strange question but I answered her and she goes, "mmmmmmmmm hmmmmmm.&nbsp; well I'm still trying to convert you."&nbsp; So my response is convert me to what?&nbsp; Because I just KNOW she is not about to start this with me.&nbsp; Her problem is that I am Catholic.&nbsp; A lot of people have opinions and problems with that and I am fine with others prejudices BUT everyone has to do what is right for them and Catholicism happens to be what is right for me.&nbsp; No I do not worship the pope or the Virgin Mary or none of that other nonsense that most people think.&nbsp; No I am not brainwashed and yes I have the common sense to question all aspects of my religion.&nbsp; Yes I do believe the church is corrupt and I am sure there is a lot of ish that goes on behind the scenes that I don't know about.&nbsp; But I also think that goes for any organized religion just&nbsp;because of the nature of it being "organized".&nbsp; However, my faith is not in man.&nbsp; My faith is in the Lord.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; My parents are very open-mided and have exposed me to all religions and beliefs.&nbsp; My father is totally anti-Catholic and actually anti-organized religion of any kind and my mother was raised catholic but is by no means devout in any way shape or form.&nbsp; They never ever made me go to church or made me pick&nbsp;one religion over another.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;even think there is such a thing as a "right" religion.&nbsp; I just think people should&nbsp;do what is best for them.&nbsp; So anyway, my friend proceeds to tell me how I am going to hell... excuse me but are you for real??&nbsp;&nbsp; She is non-denominational christian and tells me that I need to join her church because God speaks to her pastor and to the members of her church.&nbsp; At this point I wasn't even responding because there was no point.&nbsp; I just asked her to respect the decision I've made.&nbsp; Exactly how I am not shoving scripture about false prophets down her throat and respecting her decision, she needs to reciprocate that.&nbsp; I could easily have pointed out all the things wrong with her life and why she really needs to get off her high horse and get her own ish together before trying to convert someone but what is the use.&nbsp; I am secure enough in&nbsp;my beliefs that I don't feel the need to&nbsp;defend it but I do wish she would get a grip.&nbsp; One of our other best friends from high school happens to be gay and she sho nuff looked at him with the same mmmmm hhmmmm and told him he is going to hell and was really like let me see what my bible says about you.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT THE???&nbsp; First of all, I was offended because he is one of my best friends and I love him like a brother.&nbsp; I don't care if he was having sex with bunnies, I would still be his friend and I would never think poorly of him (well actually if he was having sed with bunnies we would need to have a talk with a professional but I would still love him the same).&nbsp; His character and person is not reflected in who he is attracted to.&nbsp; Secondly, who came down and granted her divine wisdom as to who she can condemn to hell.&nbsp; I have my own beliefs about heaven and hell that contradict GREATLY with my or any other religion but even if I did believe people are gonna burn in a fiery pit (which I don't) I still wouldn't walk around pointing my finger at folk damning them.&nbsp; I was so irked.&nbsp; I could really go on and on about this but I'm done now.&nbsp; aaarrrrggggghh&nbsp;

      I had a dream last night that was a little weird.&nbsp; I went to visit my high school for some reason and one of the security guards asked me for my ID so I showed him my license.&nbsp; The security guard then tells me he doesn't remember me and I told him it's probably because I graduated years ago.&nbsp; So we are walking to my car and talking about how the school used to be and I couldn't find my car.&nbsp; well actually we were so enraptured in convo that I walked right past where I had parked it and didn't realize it was missing.&nbsp; When I do finally find my car, these bad ass lil kids are pulling everything out of my trunk and setting it on fire.&nbsp; I saw one of the little boys holding up one of my notebooks about to throw it into the fire and I grabbed his lil wrist like stop it and I went off.&nbsp; I mean I WENT OFF and was about to beat errrry last one of those niglets and one of their momma's was standing there like you can't talk to my kid like that.&nbsp; So in true lizzie fashion, I proceeded to cuss out the momma (I was really trying to fight in the dream but for some reason my fists weren't obeying my commands).&nbsp;&nbsp; I was telling her that she needs to watch her bad ass kids and that's what's wrong with the world and blah, blah, blah.&nbsp;  I don't know what I was smokin last night but I can't really&nbsp;blame the dream&nbsp;to anything going on in my life right now.&nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't had any encounters with bad children recently and I haven't lost any notebooks or&nbsp;anything like that&nbsp; So I figure this is one of those random dreams that don't really mean anything.&nbsp; It was way linear which made it seem so real at the time.&nbsp; Hell I even woke up mad!&nbsp;LOL!&nbsp;  Uhm I am ashamed to admit that I am not very web or HTML savvy (as if you couldn't tell)... and well uhm.. see it's like this.... what I mean is... aaawww hell I don't know how to post pics... there I said it!!&nbsp; I wanted to put a pic of all my magnificence *wink wink* on here but I am slightly retarded.&nbsp; The direction don't seem like it should be hard but I am perplexed.&nbsp; Uhm do you mind keeping your laughter and guffaws to a minimum... thanks.&nbsp; So if anyone is curious as to what I look like, with all my magnificence *wink wink*, then that's just too damn bad!!&nbsp;

      So we I went to my book club meeting on Saturday and lemme just say that there was DRAMA.&nbsp; Why were two of the women about to get into fisticuffs?&nbsp; and these are older ladies.&nbsp; I am one of the youngest members at 24 and the other young person (who is my age) is the daughter of one of the ladies about to tussle.&nbsp; I could not believe it.&nbsp; I really thought it was about to be on and poppin and me, being the hoodrat that I am, was front and center with the popcorn and a Corona.&nbsp; Hell I don't know them like that to be trying to break shit up!!&nbsp; I don't really know how it started but there was the back and forth going on and then the next thing I know... well let me set it up for you.&nbsp; Lady #1 we'll call M-Dawg and Lady #2 will be referred to as J-Money.&nbsp; M-Dawg is probably in the age range of 27-30 and J-Money is probably in her early 40's... too&nbsp;damn old to be tusslin!&nbsp;&nbsp;M-Dawg is very proper and demure and mild-mannered so it shocked the hell out of me that she was really gettin with J-Money.&nbsp; I mean imagine&nbsp;Julie Andrews from Sound of Music about to bitch slap Babs from Da Band... mmm hmmm.&nbsp; Exactly... COMEDY.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh did I mention they are cousins!&nbsp;&nbsp;HA!&nbsp; good old family.&nbsp; anyway they never actually faught which&nbsp;is a good thing and as much as I would have enjoyed seeing a good smackfest, I wouldn't want&nbsp;it to go down like that with these ladies I see every month.&nbsp; By the end of the meeting everything was cool but it did look like a Springer episode for a minute!&nbsp; Our book selection for&nbsp;August is  Dead Above Ground  by Jervey Tervalon and for&nbsp;September we'll read the sequel  Lita.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our June selection was  A Child of God  by Lolita Files.&nbsp; I didn't finish reading it yet but almost everyone in my book club rated it a 10 or a 9.&nbsp; I am reading it now and so far it is very very good!&nbsp; Apparently it is much better than any of her other books.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of my weekend was&nbsp;rather uneventful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Went to church and played X-Box all day yesterday.&nbsp; oh and my allergies are kicking my ASS!!!&nbsp;

      The weekend has arrived and I have no money and no plans.  Well actually I have a book club meeting tomorrow for a book I haven't read yet.  I don't even remember what this month's selection is.  Actually I was reading another book... Friday Nights at Honeybees.  I'm not even gonna get into it but it was a good book.  I thought there could be a little bit  more to it but whatever.  In other news I saw I, Robot last night... it was better than I thought it was gonna be.  I need a margarita with extra tequila and I'll be a happy person.  yeah I think I might have to hit up happy hour today.

      I need some money.&nbsp; I am trying to come up with a scam... a good scam... no a&nbsp;GREAT scam.&nbsp; this job is paying me peanuts and I am scammin' these mofos errrrday for almost nothing... might as well start scammin for the big bucks.&nbsp; Speaking of "the job" aka Hades, WHY DO PEOPLE THINK IT IS SMART TO START RELATIONSHIPS WITH CO-WORKERS??&nbsp; It never works out.&nbsp; okay maybe once in a while but the majority of these things just don't work out.&nbsp; there are 5000 + employees at this company and there are more people having affairs and gettin it in with fellow employees than I care to discuss.&nbsp; Granted we spend most of our time here and it is inevitable to get to know people you like but let's keep it real...&nbsp; when yall do break up (and you will... usually over some dumb jealousy type ish) then you got to look at this fool everyday.&nbsp; And&nbsp;when he starts dating domeone else at the job (cuz&nbsp;they never learn) you gon' be all bitter and shit.&nbsp; wanting to jab him in the corneas with paperclips.&nbsp; that's not healthy.&nbsp; no one wants to be up under each&nbsp;other all- the- damn- time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.  Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.  Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,  Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.  Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.  For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.  And stand together, yet not too near together:  For the pillars of the temple stand apart,  And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow. " Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet Can I get an amen!!&nbsp; and that ain't just for workplace romance either... that goes for all relationships.. a nukka need to breeve (yes BREEVE)!

       R   emember when love wasn’t complicated?&nbsp; it was more like , “Do you like me? &nbsp;Circle one. Yes or No (no maybes).” when it was easy?&nbsp; when a dollar made you feel like the richest kid on the block?&nbsp; when you really thought M.A.S.H. could  would  determine your future?&nbsp; but that was then and this is now. and now things are complex.&nbsp; love is complex.&nbsp; because when i am with you, everything seems right.&nbsp; i feel all these things from the past again.&nbsp; i feel like a kid again.&nbsp; like a kiss from you makes me the richest kid in the world.&nbsp; like our conversations would  should  determine our futures.&nbsp; but when i am not with you, my love is convoluted.    O    ne day it will all be clear again.&nbsp; i will understand love.&nbsp; loving others.&nbsp; loving myself.&nbsp; loving you. &nbsp;even though i am not supposed to… not yet anyway.&nbsp; what am I to do until that day?&nbsp; the day when the dawning of my subconscious will be a release from that which confounds me.&nbsp; i am constantly perplexed by all that is you and me.&nbsp; what is and isn’t supposed to be. &nbsp;me and you. and what we feel, what i feel when we are&nbsp;close    C  loseness to you leaves me wanton, yearning, moist. Separation from you leaves me desperate to be close to you again.&nbsp; enraptured by you.&nbsp;my sagittarian obsession. you are fire and i am water.&nbsp; under the right circumstances, we can become steam…    K  inetic, volatile, powerful, cleansing.&nbsp; we are all these things. steam trying to escape the confines of that which contains us.&nbsp; but we can’t be together.&nbsp;&nbsp;remember when love wasn't complicated? when catching fireflies was a favorite summer night activity? when holding hands meant you were a couple?&nbsp; i remember when love wasn’t complicated.&nbsp; i remember it every time i kiss you.

      I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity... and by stupidity I mean all the dumb broads in the world who think it is cute to act retarded. One of my friends is like this... she thinks it's cute to be lost ALL THE DAMN TIME. She can't possibly be as dumb as she pretends to be and it annoys the crap out of me! We take the same elevator everyday and everyday she get off the elevator like "oh where are we? I am lost!" WTF?? How can you be lost when we've worked in the same building for the past 4 years... give me a break. You all know people like this. So why am I friends with her you ask?? Because she isn't really retarded... it's all a farce and I made it my duty to force her to accept her geekness with pride! I am what you would refer to as a super geek and I am darn proud of it! Yes I am in a book club and I love the discovery channel... SO WHAT! I know everyone can't be proud of their inner dork (we all have one), but she is out of control. I am not going to act like I've never "dumbed down" to try to fit in. After all, I grew up in what I would call a... for lack of a better word... HOOD! After years of suppressing my geekhood, I realized that I didn't really give a merry-muthafuck what anyone else thought.  Okay so back to my friend... when it's just us, she is as geekified as I am. We will talk about all types of ish... intelligently to boot. But let a wee-wee walk into the room and it's like there is a magnetic field around the penis that sucks all her brain power. Not that we need to be "smart" all the time. I am just as silly as the next person... hell, one of my all time favorite movies is Pootie Tang (I know, I know... shuckin' and jivin' but I still laughed). I guess my real issue is that she is not being true to herself. I think it is absurd that she takes on a whole different persona when ever there is a ding-a-ling within earshot. But fear not!! Truth and self-acceptance shall prevail!

      Took a quiz I found on this blog http://www.novaslim.com/sunray/   here is my results... 20 Questions to a Better Personality       Wackiness: 44/100 Rationality: 38/100 Constructiveness: 68/100 Leadership: 68/100    You are an SECL--Sober Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a politician. You cut deals, you change minds, you make things happen. You would prefer to be liked than respected, but generally people react to you with both. You are very sensitive to criticism, since your entire business is making people happy.  At times your commitment to the happiness of other people can cut into the happiness of you and your loved ones. This is very demanding on those close to you, who may feel neglected. Slowly, you will learn to set your own agenda--including time to yourself.   You are gregarious, friendly, charming and charismatic. You like animals, sports, and beautiful cars. You wear understated gold jewelry and have secret bad habits, like chewing your fingers and fidgeting.  You are very difficult to dislike.    I definitely agree except I am becoming more about me as I get older.

      It always amazes me how judgemental some people are.  I mean it is easy to point the finger when you have never experienced anything in life.  I think it is hypocritical of people to condemn someone else's life for any reason.  For instance, I am against smoking but I would never sit and tell someone how they are killing themselves and I would never say I'm not going out with them because they smoke.  That is their business and it would be insincere of me as I am an avid fan of alcohol.  One is no better than the other when you really get down to it.  We were having this debate at work which is what sparked this post in the first place.  I honestly think that people who are always up on their high horse looking down their noses at others only do so to because it makes them feel better about themselves.  If you are truly secure with yourself and what you are doing, then there is no need to point out to everyone how good you are and how bad the rest of the world is.  I know we are all judgemental at times, it's in our nature.  I've seen young girls with a half a piece of clothes on and jumped to conclusions.  That's human nature.  But when you try to box others into a category, you are really just boxing yourself out and can be missing out on a wonderful person because you just know you are better than them.  Get a grip .  If you are really that much better than the next man then help him up.  Don't just bash him and step on him to elevate yourself.  Hoorah to you for being such a righteous person but that does nto give you the right to put other people down.  Everyone makes bad decisions and there is not one person in this world that can say they have NEVER done something they are ashamed of or knew better than to do and did it anyway.  And another thing, just like how going to church does not make you a Christian, neither does not doing one sin make you sinless.

      2004-07-12 - 2:32 p.m.  These muthabytches I work for are crazy!! I swear my job is exactly like that movie Office Space. No one gets promoted based on merit or work ethic... it's all a matter of who has the most chap stick and can kiss the most ass. I am so irked right now by this place... It's purgatory and I work for the devil. I just know it. That is exactly why I have to get this writing thing together so I can be out this bitch! I've decided to write a novel. It's about love, lust, betrayal... all the good ish. I don't want it to be a typical "black novel". I want it to examine the complexities of human emotion and making wrong decisions even though you know it's wrong and there is no way it can work out. I've gotten as far as the prologue. I had two subsequent chapters completed also but I deleted it because I just thought it was crazy... I did show a few people the prologue to get some constructive criticism and so far everyone likes it. Here is an excerpt from the prologue (since that's all I have done).  There are about two or three paragraphs prior to this part but here it goes:   The only light in the room came from the alarm clock on the nightstand flashing 11:28. Sasha knew she wasn’t going to get any sleep and her curiosity was getting the better of her. She picked up the phone and, surprised at how easily she remembered the number, called his cell phone. After the third ring she was about to hang up before it could switch to voicemail when he answered.  “Hi Aaron. I am sorry about being rude to you. Are you okay?”  “You remember that parking lot behind the Moorestown Corporate Complex on route 38 right?”  “Of course.”  “Can you meet me there? I would much rather talk to you in person.”  “When?”  “As soon as you can.”  “Okay I’ll be there in 30 minutes.”  Ten minutes later Sasha was on her way to hear whatever it was that Aaron wanted to tell her. She couldn’t figure out why he would pick that particular parking lot to meet and talk. Although it was secluded and no one would be able to see them from the road, it also used to be one of their favorite places to meet. Sasha pulled in and parked. There was no sign of Aaron so she turned the headlights and the radio off so she could hear the rain. She wanted to be as relaxed as possible before seeing him. While waiting, Sasha recalled the first time they found this parking lot. It was a warm spring night in May and they decided to meet up there for a little rendezvous. She showed up in a denim skirt and white sleeveless button down top and he had on a gray and white Roca-Wear sweat suit and an all white Lakers hat. She left her underwear at home that night and as she recalled straddling him in the back seat of his Benz, both of them half dressed, she was incredibly aroused by the memory. Every time she closed her eyes, she would see his face, his neck, shoulders; all the places she kissed, licked, sucked, nibbled. The warmth was intensifying and her skin was tingling when he pulled up beside her. She wasn’t ready to see him yet, not after the things she was just thinking about. As she sat there trying to banish the memories, she heard him knock on her passenger door.    I am new on the web so I know no one is reading this BUT if anyone happens to stumble across this, let me know what you think. Keep in mind that it is a rough draft! I have redone the first chapter like 5 times but nothing seems right. I will keep at it though... we'll see what happens.    But on another note, I watched City of God last night. That movie is so good. I am gonna watch it again tonight. It took me a good 20 minutes to get into it but once I did, I was hooked. It's a true story about this Brazilian slum and the "hoods" that lived there. They were GANGSTA!

        I had some bangin' ass jamaican food for lunch today. curried chicken with rice and peas. mmm mmmm. I got it from a local restaurant and was shocked at how good it actually was. I mean they had nothing on my mom's cooking of course but it was good for a little whole in the wall spot. So my cousin (same girl from the pink shoes story) and I are bustin a fat grub and reminiscing about the last time we ate bula or bun and cheese or ackee and saltfish and it hit me that my children (when I have some) are gonna be deprived of these things because I can't cook jamaican food! I am a disgrace *hangs head in shame*. Don't get me wrong, I can cook almost everything else very well. My macaroni and cheese is not to be fucked with... but when it comes to jamaican food... I just don't know how to cook it. well maybe it is more that I've never tried than I don't know how. I've never had to. My mother was a stay at home mom and when I came home from school, she was already stirring a pot of brown stew chicken or oxtails or whatever else we were having for dinner. The most I had to do was maybe peel a potato or something like that. I am now on a mission to learn whatever I can from my mom so I can pass it on to my children and they can pass it on to theirs. It's bad enough my patois is severely lacking and although I can understand it perfectly, I wouldn't dream of talking it to anyone outside my immediate family. I don't sound as bad as miss cleo but I don't sound good either! So I called my mom and told her I am gonna make myself a cookbook of all of her jamaican dishes. She agreed I can watch her cook and write down whatever I want but of course she has no measurements or anything like that. I am definitely going to do this because my cousins and I are the first generation off the island and when our parents die, I want to have something to pass on to our future generations. After I make my first jamaican dinner. I will let you know how it turns out!

      Okay I am OUTRAGED!  urlLink this bitch  needs to have her fingernails ripped off with rusty pliers. This is just so damn sad. It sickens me that someone can rationalize letting a 5 year old smoke crack!!! I feel so sorry for this little boy and the ramifications the actions of his mother will have on his life in the future. There is absolutely no excuse for this...  I am thoroughly disgusted.

      So you all know I am from NJ... obviously. I'm not going to bother blogging about our governer's "I'm a gay American" speech because it's been the topic of discussion for the past few days and I'm tired of talking about it. But  urlLink this  is a very good explanation how the majority of us New Jersey folk are feeling...

      My friend Diddy and I are starting our own company... tentatively called HA, Inc.  (HA standing for Hoez Anonymous or Happy Asses).  We are going to release a line of self help books as follows: "Hoes, Smarten Up!!" The self-help book for Hoodrats! "Chicken Soup for the Clucker Soul: Inspirational Stories from Cluckers Worldwide"  (clucker meaning chickenhead of course) "Confessions of a Jump Off" or "Confessions of a Side Piece"  We have a few more ideas swimming around in our head.  We came up with Ha, Inc. because we are always laughing at someone...  we are serious pranksters!  We went on a foiling spree we called "Operation Foil Wonderland" where we covered people's cars with aluminum foil.  We hit up my 2 of my cousins and one of Diddy's friends.  We covered paper plates with foil to make spinners for their cars!  EXTRA FUNNY.  I can't find the pictures of my one cousin's car but we literally covered his whole car in foil!  We prank people at work too.  we stole our friend's mouse ball out his mouse and put it in his candy jar.  We switched around letters on one of our friend's keyboard since we know they can't type worth a damn and are always looking at the keys!  We've decorated someone's desk with "It's a Boy!" stuff so everyone would think they were pregnant!  HAAAAAAAA!!!  We haven't pranked anyone in a while though.  Yeah we might be too old to still be pranking but the shyt is funny!  I'll be a prankster for life!   Anyway, if you would like to reserve your advanced copies of Hoes Smarten Up or Chicken Soup for the Clucker Soul...  let me know!  Sayonara!

      I am back from Canada!  I had such a nice time.  I got to see a lot of family that I haven't seen in a good many years.  We did some sightseeing but just chilled for the most part.  It amazes me that Montreal (where I was)  looks like any other city/suburb but the people are so different.  Even in the poorest sections of the city, people had so much pride.  The streets were much clean, everyone was courteous and it was just overall a very nice experience.  Definitely what I needed to get my spirit in order.  So updates on "the boy"... I am finally really totally completely fed up with this fool.  Our conversations have pretty much been just about the weather and other such nonsense.  He did ask me how my trip was but I didn't even feel like starting this whole cycle of being cordial and then having deep discussions and then him actually being open, only to shut it down again.  I am actually proud of myself for not being beat.  It is hard for me to leave people behind.  Scrabble girl and I haven't talked since I told her about herself.  She did, however, call all of our mutual friends crying on the phone and talking about she didn't know I was upset and she doesn't know where all this is coming from or why I would call her a bad friend.  You see, when I did tell her about herself, I didn't leave it at just the shoes.  Maybe it was the wrong time, but I let her know about all the competitiveness and bullshyt she pulls on the regular that I am not gonna tolerate from her or any other person I call friend.  (she's really done too much to type but a few examples are that if anyone in our circle likes a guy then she has to be the one to get with him... even if she's paid no interest in this person up until that point.  And she will do this by any means necessary.  One of our friends is bigger than the rest of us but she is BEAUTIFUL inside and outside and has no problem pulling a nukka but scrabble girl looks at her one night and says "let's see who can get the most numbers"...  FOR WHAT?  anyway those are just two smaller examples).  Anyway, she made her rounds on the phone and a few people called me to tell me she was crying and that I was over-reacting but when I told them how ish really went down, they understood where I was coming from.  She is going around telling everyone how I am mad over a pair of shoes that she said she was getting first and she didn't know I wanted them.  What the???  Not only can I not believe that she is crying to everyone for sympathy, but then you are gonna lie on top of it.  Trying to make me look bad... Oh hell naw!  And what's more is that I didn't even tell anyone in our circle what happened aside from the two that I consider my soul sisters.  mainly because I am not interested in any one taking my side or anything like that.  but she is really calling everyone to give them her side of the story first...  And her little crying thing is fake because I told my cousin what happened and she told scrabble girl that she was gonna get them for me as a gift and scrabble girl told her that if my attitude is adjusted when I get back from vacation, then she'll give them to me.  UHM 'SCUZE ME... does she not know I will mollywhop her ass.  my cousin didn't tell me she said this until I was in Canada because she knew I would have walked directly to her desk and adjusted her damn face!  so she ain't even on bitch please status anymore.  Nona, honey, I might need you to come bail a bitch out of jail though because I may be forced to administer the good old fashioned Camden two piece (and I ain't even talking about a leg and a thigh neither)!  HMPH!

      yall.... scrabble girl is at it again. WHY did this bitch go buy my shoes. I had to address her ass because this lil competition bullshit is out of control. the story goes a lil something like this... my cousin works at the same company as us and she knows I have a shoe fetish and I love pink (since before everybody has been rocking it this year). She came to my desk to show me the BADDEST pair of BCBG pink 4" stilettos. Scrabble girl was at my desk when my cousin came to show me. Now Scrabble girl 1) doesn't like pink 2) never wears 4" stilettos.... ever. I told my cousin I was going to get them directly after work and I got all the info from her. Scrabble girl sat on my desk and agreed they were cute but that's all she said. So anyway, I tell my cousin again that I have to have them and I am going directly at 5 to get them. I then turn to Scrabble Girl and ask her if she wants to go to the mall with me after work so she said yeah. Then she went back to her desk and emailed me that she had something to do after work but can I wait until 6:30 because she wanted to go. So I thought nothing of it and agreed to meet her at Macy's at 6:30. When I walked into the shoe dept. this heffa had MY shoes in her hands talking about oh they only had one pair of 6 1/2 left and she was getting them. I was about to go off. I literally had to stop myself from punching her directly in the eye. that is some funky ass shit.  she proceeds to purchase them and then is like oh well you can see if they have them somewhere else. I had to walk out of Macy's I couldn't stand in there with her because I was gonna go off on her wannabe ass and I decided to just walk out instead of getting arrested up in there. and I refuse to act a fool around "the others" since that is always what they expect from us anyway. but that 's not even the kicker. I haven't talked to her since I walked out of Macys and she emails me this morning like "if you want them that bad you can buy them off me." Is this bitch for real. As if she is doing me some sort of muthaphuckin favor. uhm let me think about it... how bout no. Am I over-reacting? I might be over-reacting but I am taking this as a sign of some serious character flaws. I explained to her that friends don't do that competitive devious bullshit to which she replied... and I quote, "it's not my fault if I do things that bother you and don't realize it " (do I even need to say anything). so I must put her on bitch please status. I categorize all my friends as follows:  Soul Sister- this is someone who is my sister in spirit. we have a deep understanding and respect for each other. Relationship is one of loyalty, honesty, openness. This is the person I will plot on unsuspecting mofos with. (currently 2 people besides my momma hold this title)  Party Diva- this is someone who I call to go to the club because I know we are gonna have a good time. we can drink together, hang out together, go shopping, go eat. you might even know a few of my cousins... BUT I ain't telling you any of my business cuz "we ain't cool like that". (all the rest of my friends- mostly work associates)  Bitch Please- Don't think because I am cordial to you we are cool. I gave you a chance to be party diva and you must have shown your ass in more way than one because I usually employ a three strike rule before putting anyone in this category... aka Scrabble Girl.  uhg I can't wait to take a break from (as Keisha so accurately described) grown ass fools! The bitches...

      1) Yesterday I had a good talk with the weirdo from  urlLink this post . Nothing was really resolved but at least I did get some of my feelings off my chest. I was just going to post our conversation since it was over email but I deleted the email yesterday. To summarize he was saying that he's been feeling a little trapped lately and he feels the need to escape. I just told him he needs to be true to himself and stop with the frontin on everybody. I pointed out that he can't look to other people and to social status or situations to make him happy but he needs to be happy with himself. He is, in essence, trapping himself with the all the bullshyt. He said he agreed but he can't be himself because of his circumstances. Now I knew he was once again feeding me the bullshit... not keeping it real. I told him as much and pointed out that he makes his own circumstances. Of course at this point he shut it down and hit me with the PC response "We have a lot in common and I think your advice is good." What the?? Yall I am done. He is a re-re. It is so official. See normally when he is feeling down, I would have assuaged his ego and pretty much try to encourage him but this time I just put his own bullshit back in his face and what does he do? Does he stand there and finish the conversation HE started? Nope... he does the bytch move and runs for cover. He really is quite selfish. This is what is making it easier for me to say to hell with trying to be friends and to hell double time with all the potential I thought I saw in him... oh did I mention he is hella older than me... but he is acting like a little kid and I am just done. (I still got a soft spot for him though... aaarrrghhh)  2) Anyway, I went to a book signing last night for Karen E. Quinones Miller ( Satin Dolls, I'm Telling , and  Using What You Got ) for her new book  Ida B . My book club went collectively and had such a nice time. It was at a club in Philly. We did some networking and met some other authors. Good fun!  3) Bitches! Me and two of my friends all work at the same place. now instead of working like we should be doing, we were playing an online game of scrabble. (I guess you can already see where this is going). Anyway I was winning by a lot. the one girl, who I've mentioned  urlLink here , gets mad and is seriously like you can't use the dictionary, if you are not sure a word is a word then you can't use it. uhm what? isn't that what the dictionary is for. We set the rules in the beginning of the game as follows: Any word can be used if it can be found on  urlLink www.dictionary.com  and no acronyms. that's it! simple right? Well apparently not because this biatch really came off on me because I was winning. so I was like this is stupid and I just won't play becasue it is not that serious. As a result, she is now not talking to me and dissed me for lunch. You read this correctly, she's not my friend cuz I won't play scrabble. I am amused by this because we are too damn old to be mad about a game. I know she is a slow one so I am not gonna be mad. I'll just wait for her to get over it. weirdo  4) I am still looking for a scam. I am open to suggestions :-)  5) Crack is Wack  6) Pod restaurant in Philly is the devil (I was gonna link it but there website is down or something)... I swear I could eat there everyday.  7) Bourne Supremacy was the shyt.  8) Amel Larrieux's new cd  Bravebird  is fan-phuckin-tastic  9) I can't wait to dance off all my aggression on Friday.  10) I need sleep.... and some of that watermelon twist smirnoff!!

      So I have been dreaming like crazy lately. My fellow Pisces know that this is not uncommon for us but this is ri-damn-diculous. Every night it's been long dreams that seem so real I am actually starting to feel like I am not getting any sleep. Actually, the content of the dreams are forcing me to deal with some things I had on the back burner which is good but I'm sayin tho... can I get a break. I need like a good 18 naps to get my equilibrium back. sheesh... Anyway, I am real geeked about my weekend! I am going to the  urlLink First Fridays  event and I haven't been to one in a looooooooong time. Should be fun! And then Saturday morning I am going to Canada to visit family. I haven't been back to Canada in about 7 years. I can't wait. I definitely need the mini vaca to just chill and escape all the crappy events and people that are stressing me out here. It will give me some time to reflect on my life and do a little introspective inquiry. Get myself grounded again. I really need to get on my selfish kick and do me for a while. I feel depleted. This trip is exactly what I need to satiate my spirit. Yes a trip and maybe a little of that watermelon twist smirnoff!!

      A man never knows how to say goodbye; a woman never knows when to say it.  ~Helen Rowland  This is so true.  I think I am finding myself in this situation with the exception that I know it's time to say goodbye but I am a creature of habit and there is a part of me that is avoiding the inevitable.  Well actually I am starting to come to grips with what it is.  I see all the potential in this person and I try my best to bring out the best in him.  I see what a funny, smart, interesting, passionate, spontaneous, adventurous person he is on the inside but he puts on this front to the whole world, including me, like he is just this cool, calm, always in control person that doesn't even seem human... more like a robot.  I know this isn't the case after over 2 years of friendship with this person.  When he has let his guard down, I've seen glimpses of this fire that makes him an extraordinary being with all the human qualities that endears someone to us.  But the majority of the time, when he puts up that wall, it is back to being a walking commercial.  I wish he could just be the person that I know he is on the inside.  Not the cold, emotionless person that he shows to the world.  I thought we were better than that but he treats me like joe blow one minute and then like his best friend the next.  I try to accept him either way because I do consider him one of my best friends.  I tell him everything.  but I am starting to feel like our friendship is a big facade because he never keeps it real with me.  There is always some kind of game and quite frankly I'm not beat to play games with him.  I don't see the point in playing games.  I am a very straightforward person and what you see is what you get for the most part.  I share me with him in my entirety.  he knows my mind, my world.  I know him a lot better than he thinks he does because I've observed and I pay attention.  I know how his mind works which is why I tolerate the bullshit but everyone has a breaking point and I think I have reached mine.  I know he cares about me more than he would like to and he knows I have mad love for him.  I also think he is uncomfortable with his emotions and the fact that I take him out of his comfort zone.  I challenge the control he has over his emotions and himself.  I've told him time and again that I don't want anything except his friendship and honesty.  I've told him if he is uncomfortable with the intensity that I bring then I will fall back.  Of course he says this is not the case but why else would he push me away.  He abuses my friendship and my spirit in the worste way.  Am I a glutton for punishment?  I did try to fall back and I stopped emailing him and I stopped seeing him and then he came after me.  he emailed me and looked for me.  and sucked me back in.  then here I am just being me and he just.... I don't know how to put it but it is like he can't handle me as I am but I almost feel like he wants to.  Not like in a be his girlfriend type of way because that is not the dynamic of our relationship.  I mean like he just wants me to be there.  Like he just wants to be sure of me.  He is always testing me and testing my loyalty and trustworthiness.  That's a selfish type of friendship though.  that is a one-sided interaction.  He wants me to give what I have been giving but he doesn't want to have to give anything in return.  He doesn't want to be vulnerable emotionally.  t leaves me wondering were we ever really friends or was it always something else?  In my naivete and blind trust in him, did I miss something that would have warned me I was about to have my heart broken by him?  He did break my heart and not in a romantic sense but just by not living up to his potential as a person.  Yeah it is definitely time for me to say goodbye.  I just don't know if I can really do it...
