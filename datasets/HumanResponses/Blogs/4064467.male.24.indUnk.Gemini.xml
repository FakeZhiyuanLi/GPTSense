      I just watched the new Blue Collar Sketch Show on the WB. It was pretty good. I happen to think Larry the Cable Guy is a great comic and Jeff Foxworth and Bill&nbsp; whatever is his name is aren't bad either. I hope the show stays on for a couple weeks though, it'll give me something to look forward to watching on TV. As it is, I don't bother watching anything unless I just happen upon it.  I should be getting my new RedvsBlue Season 2 DVD next week. I can't wait for that! The first one was great and this season was good, but it'll be nice watching them on my TV instead of my computer.   I'm not heading to TN tomorrow. Found out that I'll need to meet with the owners of the company I'm interested in working for another time. That's not bad though cause I got stuck with a Teleconference tomorrow afternoon that would have screwed with my leaving time anyways, so it worked out. I'll probably just head to Richmond and hang out with the folks.  Well, what else is going on. Not much I suppose. Looking forward to a new video game next week, that'll be a nice change.&nbsp; I wonder if I'll ever grow up and stop playing video games....I doubt it. haha  Okay, that's it. I'm out. Enjoy!

      But I thought I'd take a break and post.&nbsp; My step brother got a pretty sweet new truck yesterday.&nbsp;    .   Found out a little about one of the job offers yesterday. I'd be interested, but only if the other job didn't turn out to be something I want.&nbsp; Either way, I know I'm quitting this one the 9th of August. I may be broke and poor soon enough.   I'll know tonight whether I'm heading to TN tomorrow after work or not. I don't mind driving down, but its a 6 hour trip and I'll be making it at the end of a long day so I'll be exhausted by the time I get there. I'd rather go down and spend a couple days, but I don't always get what I want.   I'm going to get back to work...more later.

      I'm on here again....I don't know why.&nbsp; I've just been relaxing since I finished up with work though.&nbsp; I need to find out more about the job offer I received today, but I have the rest of the evening.  My stepdad's hunting dog just had pups yesterday. We have 9 squirming and active pups and I may go down and check them out this weekend. If not, then I'm heading to TN to check on another job situation.&nbsp;I have to figure it out sooner or later...something has to give.  Well, I'll end this. I think I'm going to play some guitar or just continue relaxing...either way its all good.

      Okay, here I am again. This might get addictive.....well I doubt many people come to read this anyways.  I suppose over time people (if anyone reads it) will learn more about me. I don't feel like doing an story of my life or telling about myself...I'll just let those type things work themselves out.  I've been doing some listening to some new music lately.&nbsp; The bands O.A.R. (Of A Revolution), Pat McGee Band, and Carbon Leaf.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest everyone give these bands a listen if you haven't before.&nbsp; I've grown to like them all and hope to see O.A.R. in concert next month.   I just finished up with work for the day though and I actually got a job offer also today. I need to find out more about it and see what the opportunity looks like. I do know that I'm quitting this job in August and will be moving out of my apartment the first of September...just need another job to move into.

      This shall be my first post ever on this blog. Not really sure how this will work out, but I'll give it a go.&nbsp;  I'm a 24 year old college grad living in Fredericksburg, VA. I've been in the working world since October and I'm ready to make a career change. I guess we'll see how that goes.  This at the time will be all for now. I gotta figure this thing out.....

      This is a rant.....so stop reading if you aren't interested.  I made my weekly trip to Walmart today. I try to keep the trips to once a week, but sometimes thing will be crazy and I'll have to make a return trip.  Going to Walmart is like traveling to a foreign land...you never know what is in store for you each time you venture in there.  Walmart is like the mixing place of society. Everyone from all walks of life come in there on a quest to find whatever they are looking for. Some people just like to walk around...it's like a social experiment everytime I'm there.  You can see some of societies many problems also....I'm talking about the parents who treat their kids like dirt, the parents who can't parent and have wild out of control kids. You see the people who haven't mastered counting to 10 or 20 because they've never come close to being under the 20 items and less or the 10 items or less line.   You see the people who are always rude and bothersome, the nice people, and well every other type of person is there too.  It's always an adventure.  Sometimes I feel like I'm going to go crazy while I'm there, but as soon as I walk out, I say to myself "Self, you've just made it through another trip to Walmart!"  You never know what you'll see or what language you'll hear while in there, but most importantly you'll see how everyone else is living.

      Went down to Richmond this weekend to hang out with the family.  Had a relaxing weekend, which is always good.  We have 9 puppies at the house so there was plenty of activity going on. They are all growing and doing well and the momma dog is getting her strength back everyday.  The pups are Wirehaired Pointing Griffons.....what you ask? Yeah, they aren't real real common. I only think there are a handful in Virginia, but they are good dogs. Mostly used for hunting, but this litter will give us a good amount of $$$. haha They were pretty cool though. I ended up doing a lot of helping with them....today I used the syringe and squeezed milk through a tub into their bellies so they grow a little easier and also to make things a little easier on the momma.  Okay, enough about dogs. Looking forward to this week, should be pretty good. I'll either be heading for a job interview this weekend coming up or I'll be heading down to my buddy's engagement party in NC...either one will be a good weekend.  I'm hoping things work out though with this job down in TN. I'd love to get back down to the area again and this job would provide my ticket....we'll just wait and see how it goes.  Okay, enough writing. I'll try to keep up a little more this week.  Oh yeah, I got confirmation today that my box seats to the VT and USC game at the end of this money. My buddy and I speptn about $300 a piece and got 4 box seats at FedEx Field....so it should be fun. Okay, I'm out....later
