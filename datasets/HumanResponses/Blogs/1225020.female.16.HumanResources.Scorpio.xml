      so i found out that journals really suck. and i dont even know why i have one. these past couple days have been hard...im leaving vans. my last day is wednesday. i want to leave, but i dont want to leave the people i work with. and that makes me sad. i have been fighting with danny a lot latley and i dont know why..but i know its me though.  he has taught me a lot since i have been with him, and i just want to thank him for putting up with me. i think i am like this in regards to me leaving for mexico.  i am totally stoked to go, i have never been anywhere, besides nevada and utah and i know this is a once in a lifetime expierence. i just dont like the fact that i am in a totally different country than the person i want to be the closest to. its been about 8 months, and in those 8 months i have learned to want somebody, and definatley to need somebody.  and i am sure alot of you know that when you love someone you need to just hear their voice, or feel thier touch..and if you havent then your time will come..trust me.  i cant do this for a week with him. and it just hurts. so it basically just comes down to im going to miss him like crazy.  i know this will test our relationship, and i know everything will be okay. i just know it.  i trust him more than anyone..and i know he loves me and would never hurt me. so i dont even know what i am worried about.  so enough of that. thats just what has been bothering me. i saw emily at hot dog on a stick on my way to work.  she has changed so much...i waved and she waved.   its just so wierd..i have so many memories with her its kind of hard not to miss them.  she introduced me to the best friends that i have now, and without them i dont know what i would do.  its just weird i dont know.  well im gonna go shower or something.

      my ear hurts, i cant sleep on it. i have to go clean it. i am home alone..i have to go shower and get danny lunch annd go give it to him at BP. went to b-dizzle and then after that danny robert alyssa and i went to some scary contruction site and we jumped into sewers( without fecal matter) and we lit off fireworks.  it was so loud you could go deaf.  and so then the whole tunnel started filling up with smoke and we couldnt breathe so we left.  OH. and i must say this story...we are walking to try and find this spot and there are big sticks that line certain measurments sticking out of the ground that are about waist length high.  danny purposly walks into and the stick gives him a nice nut tap.  so to get revenge he tries to "karate kick" the next one he sees and as you know that plan backfired and it broke, but the bottom half of the stick went into is leg.  and that resulted in me seeing the biggest splinter of my life.  haha. we went back to dannys house and we watched the nathans hot dog eating contest on ESPN.  hah. it was awesome.  im gonna go shower now, go have llunch with danny and then i have to work 5 to close.  RAD.

      so these past 2 days have been very fun and busy.  Sunday danny and i went to the fair.  It was a lot of fun..we didnt go on any rides or anything because i didnt want to die. We fed camels in the petting zoo and looked at all the pools. boy did i want to jump in.  Danny won me a goldfish.  I named him Basil..like the spice. haha.  He was cute but the bag kept leaking and i didnt feel like feeding him all the time so i left him in the parking lot.  I KNOW that sounds mean, but its a 10 cent goldfish. And dont even worry , i have gotten enough shit from my family for doing that. So after that, we came back to my house and my dad barbequed and then ran through the sprinkler and danny got mad at me because i put him in a headlock and got his hairwet but it was all ok later and then i cant really remember what we did after that.  Yesterday i really didnt feel to good, i got john to cover my shift yesterday. that was nice of him.  i hate working at vans.  i just got off today, and i need to rant on things that piss me off there.  I HATE when you are greeting people and you say" hello how are you doing today?" and they just walk right by you without saying anything. And while i am there hanging up shirts i am thinking to myself" what a fucking dick hole" and then i find out that they are deaf and then i feel like a wang.  So thats one thing, and THEN. This one really gets my goat.  When your helping little kids and your putting shoes on one of them and then one of the siblings starts making faces at you, like sticking out there tongue and shit, and then i just think to myself, well should i really stick my tongue out at him? but then the mom might see....and blah.  so i just ponder while the little kid keeps doing it and then i just say to myself"be the bigger person just be the bigger person" and then i let it go..but i am not satisfied. I hate customer service. So i put my 2 weeks in today, i am pretty stoked about that.  Im gonna go to club sport now. I saw anchorman. HAHA. i love that movie. IM JUST IN A BOX OF EMOTION!! kills me. oh i got my orbital pierced.  On my left ear. i know it sounds gay but it looks pretty good. it hurt alot. i dont let pain hurt me like you cant tell on the outside that it hurts but when a guy is sticking the needle in yes it fucking hurts i dont care what anyone says, your just screaming on the inside. thats what i do. haha. tammy came in and visited me today.  it was good to see her, i miss her bubbly personality. i miss playing v-ball with her. she was fun.  alright im gonna go now so bye.holy shit this is long.

      so yesterday was a long day, but a good one.  Danny and i went to modesto to look at puppies that were up for adoption because my dad said that they have like over 100 dogs that they need to get rid of.  So we get there and they have 5.  So at that time i am like" ok dad thanks alot" but they had this real cute black lab puppy that was SO CUTE GOD DAMNIT.  and so we left.  We got lost for 2 hours in stockton because danny claimed to know where the freeway was but i just let him drive, i didnt say anything. haha.  so we got home is the bottom line.  We went to Mountain Mikes in livermore and we ate and played video games and we came back to my house.  My dad was being so helpful to danny and i about where to get a puppy and telling us where to go and everything and once i say that it might now work out right now he just laughs like its a fucking joke. and that made me mad.  But my mom gave me money. i guess i just have to be sad now in order to get money from my mom.  we went back to dannys house and played DAAAAVE MIRA BMX and i did a barspin. he took me home, and we talked about old times, like before we went out and making moves and everything and it was just funny.  i love him to death.  so it is like 8:30 in the morning and me my sister and my mom are going to petsmart to look at what they have there. i might have to work at noon but lets just hope i dont.  i want to go to the fair tonight.  YAY. no rides though.  rides suck.  EXHIBITS BABY.

      so today i have the day off, and so does danny.  Already this day is nice. Last night i worked, tammy, ben and aub came and visited me!! so i was happy even though i had to go take cardboard down to the dumpster, i couldnt really talk long and i felt bad, so sorry i left in a rush.  I had to mop, but it wasnt bad i was mopping like a mad man.  So after i went over to dannys and amber and ashley were there.  Ashley is really nice, i like her.  anyways, we went to coldstone and got ice cream, and i am obsessed with having gummi bears in my ice cream and they put lots but they were STAIL. but i ate them anyways.  So we went back to dannys and watched DONT GET ELIMINATED!!! this helps me a lot with my problem with asians. heheheheh. So today has come...and me and danny are going to the modesto pound to look at some puppies there.  I am very impatient and i get my heart set on things and once someone says YEA LETS GET A PUPPY i get REALLY REALLY excited like jo jo the circus clown and i hold them to that, and then when they dont get a puppy im all dissapointed like a jerk off. but that is how i am. and i need to learn to stop being so gay. so im sorry.  ANYWAYS. so im stoked to spend the day with him.  lets pray we come home with a puppy................................=).   COMMENTS PEOPLE!

      so i just woke up, my mom found me on the floor and told me to go climb in her bed. oh man it was comfy.  Worked last night, it was fun..im kinda sad Steve is leaving.  He is the only one there that has a wierd sense of humor like i do. All we do is play the same song over and over and dance.  Danny came in and visited which was awesome because while i was consolidating shipments i was going to call him.  He bought a hella cool shirt and some sandals and i gave him 50 percent off.  =)  He got me a banana-banana smoothie from surf city too, and waited for me to close.  I don't care what anyone says, I have the best boyfriend ever.  Danny and I came back to my house, and i tried to get money from my mom but that was to no avail.  So i made me and danny some food and we watched sports blunders show on ESPN and we hung out.  It was nice to just lay down, i was tired from dancing in the previous hours of the night.  So it ended up us falling asleep.  which is AMAZING because danny never falls asleep when he is with me.  so that was nice. and then he went home and now im going to get my dads truck smoged and get breakfast and danny is coming with. but he doesnt know it yet.  i work tonight too, 5 to close. so stop by if you want.  BYEEE

      LONG TIME NO TALK! so im bored and a lot of things have changed since october. I'll just give you the obvious. I passed junior year, i got my license, got a car, a great and loving boyfriend that i have been with for 7 awesome months, i got a job working part time at Vans annnd......i have great friends. I got back from vegas with alyssa and her family not too long ago, which was totally cool despite some misunderstandings with danny. But it worked out of course like it always does and not to mention it was hot as frick there and walking like 10 steps made me want to melt. anyways, i leave for mexico with danielle on the 24th and i have to say i am stoked for that besides the fact that i have seen my boyfriend every single day since December 5th of 2003 and not seeing him for 7 days will be a challenge for me. i love him lots. so im sitting here, just did dishes because i am awesome and waiting for a call from the shop to tell me when my car is ready. my car is awesome and everyone knows it, and the front suspension is STILL on and was NEVER OFF, thank you very much. My air conditioning is broken which is not very cool whatsoever seeing as how it gets like 80 something degrees here and my car is like dark and heat consuming. so i just sweat everywhere i go and it works out fine. BUT HERES THE THING. my car isnt in the shop for the AC. fucking shitty i know. its in for the freaking power steering because my steering wheel decides to be cool and just not move sometimes. and thats a problem. So enough about that. went swimming yesterday. that was fun. and i have to shower now and go to work and then do the same thing tomorrow. AWESOME. 143 closing at Vans. bye bye
