      2004-04-30 14:20:00;  i'm moving tomorrow. not to chicago, but to a house with someone from school. i'm excited but a little scared. I'm sure we'll get along, but i feel a little awkward about the whole thing. i think it'll be an exciting time. all i need to do is decide what's going to happen in the fall, and how i'm going to get there, but i'm just not going to worry about that at all. i already have bags and dark spots under my eyes.   a couple of days ago i had a breakthrough as i was practicing. well, to start with, i had a break down earlier that day starting with my suckass lesson. of course i felt like utter shit because i could have done better. could'a would'a should'a. but it made me really depressed. not just that though. it's everything piled onto one shoulder and i feel humped over cause I can't deal with it all. i have too much pride and my ego gets bruised. i felt like i make all these efforts to get better and i still am not healthy. i talked to kevin and that was helpful, but the reallly awesome thing happened when i was trying to sautille (rapid uncontrolled bouning bow). i've been trying to do this off and on for years. i try for a while and then i have to stop for a while because it's frustrating and i'm so stiff in my body that i can't do it. after a while i can't move at all. so, i was looking in the mirror. i dropped my wrist, i let tension go, and just like that i was doing it!! it was awesome. i felt that this was god telling me that he can release me from all the tension that rests in my body and in my mind. i feel so much better now like something was pulled from out of me. anger. resentment. torment.  i'm going with the flow. i'm going to do whatever it is i need to do to get to where i need to get. i'm actually....happy?

      2004-04-28 15:49:00;  i'm extremely dehydrated - you'd think I'd want to do something about that.   everyone can see through me. i'm equivalent to a jellyfish. there's nothing that isn't exposed, and of course there's not much they can do ( the jellyfish) about that besides hide or try to blend in. i think i'm making all these strides to get better, and i still have trouble getting it together. i try, i want to, but it's so hard. ok. the whole personality thing. even though i feel relatively under most of the time, i try to, in most cases, come across as friendly, somewhat happy, and together. though, when you're not happy no matter what you do you'll never appear to be, or at least i haven't figured out how to. but i don't wanna just fake. i want the real thing. faking taxes all my reserves, and then i end up lashing out somebody or crying at the absolute worst time to cry. i have a blurred view. i'm dehydrated. i made a list a few journals back of all the good things about me, true of me? something like that. positive things. i really believe them - the things i wrote. i just don't know how to live them. i don't know how to make those things mine.   the funny thing is that i try and try and try and try and try somemore, and pray and try and then i'm told it's too much. it has to be effortless, natural. what the..... is anyone natural? most people are fake as hell, and here, is a person who genuinely wants very badly to figure out who they are, who wants to find their happiness, and get her self confidence back. i keep thinking there's something around the corner. there's a breakthrough waiting with my name on it. just sit still and hold tight.   I can't go home. that's no longer and option. i'm like dammit!!!!! i'm not even sure i'd want to be there in the first place. i'm not so sure i know where i'm supposed to be. supposed to - is that relativity.   yet again, i'm reminded that i have to stop feelling sorry for myself. get out of the gutter. light the fire. find a way out of this, because if i don't, and soon, i will be consumed by ...... me.

      2004-04-27 11:14:00;  i came up with this idea in the middle of the night. i couldn't sleep most of it. sometimes when that happens i know there's a problem i need to invest some time in because it stressing me the hell out. i remembered the last counseling session i had - i said something like, "none of the choices bad choices." seemed like pearls of wisdom when i said it, but i wonder if i really meant it. i mean, the decision to go home for a while. that one really hurts my pride, my ego, and i simply don't know what that would mean for me. what would that mean? i think i need to figure that out before i get there. i don't want any pressure to be any more christian than i already am, which consists simply of believing and having faith in god, being a good person. i don't want to be forced to go to church or take communion of any of those things. it has to come naturally or not at all. i don't want eric to be pushed on me. i don't want to be with him in any way outside of our friendship. i couldnt picture myself married to him, especially. annoying friends make annoying spouses even though he's a wonderful person *disclaimer* as i've said a milliion times, i want the healing i need to be between me and god - our terms, not what my mother thinks i should do. i'm very afraid of that.   so the plan is to talk to mimi about moving in with lucy instead of me, and then try to give her the job i have currently at the music library. i think that would work out for all three of us, if not then i'd stay here and live with lucy because we already shook hands on it and i can't take back my word - she's counting on it. i figured out in the middle of the night when my personal briliiance happens that even if i had two jobs i still wouldn't make enough money to move and have a little money in my pocket for emergency stuff.   i'm just very concerned that i'll go home and be miserable, but i get the feeling that i won't, and maybe this will be the first time i'll have a sense of what a family should look like. it'd be nice to know in case i decide to have my own some day, and it'd more importantly be part of the healing process. oh, the healing process. it is just that isn't it. what ever happens, the goal is to get out of here asap. memphis doesn't have a good conotation for me. it's not a happy tamar place. mostly because of the images i had of living there with my last step dad. this one's pretty cool, and the last one's okay, it just seems they all turn into monsters when they're with my mom. maybe that's a bit harsh, but she admitted that not me. see, memphis is the past. i hated my family situation, i hated the summer jobs i had to work there. i hate that i won't really be able to practice. ok. i've thought it though, but i can't predict what the outcome would be.   i think i've got it down now.

      2004-04-26 08:14:00; last night was one of the best i've had here; a memorable moment. mimi and i went to the roof of the school of music and practiced. i cannot fully explain how amazing the sky was just before dark. it was blue reflecting light from the crescent shaped moon and the one visible star. the cool air breathed over my body taking with it any anxiety i had over getting caught. my endpin rested between tiny rocks that covered the whole area. my bow and my fingers broke the dashing wind. mimi is far over to my right, she has vivaldi and i have haydn. we could see the tops of all the building in the distance. god, this was perfect.  12:22p.m.  i realize i've managed to screw up my finances in a big way. someone please tell me it's not that bad. i don't know what my problem is. i just have a hard time trying hard enough to get and keep it together. there's no way i can move the way things are going right now. i'll have student loans to pay back, and barely scraping by with rent. i'll have to get another job asap so I can get everything squared away. talk talk talk. i hate talking. i'd rather stick my foot in my mouth so i'd never have to talk again. i can just do, and only prove myself in that way. that's what's wrong. i'm like one of those weak people who never does any of the things they say they'll do. it has to get redundant after a while. who wants to be known as the person who never does anything. i should have gotten another job a while ago, but i didn't. something's wrong with that. i guess i thought i'd magically start practicing. i'll have to come up with another hundred dollars by the end of this week so i can pay rent for the new place i'm moving into which, by the way, happens to be fabulous. i'm excited. it'll be much cleaner - or at least i'll feel that way since everything looks clean and not so old and dirty it'll never look clean. ever. lucy will be my new roommate for the next 3 months, and whiskers the cat - sweetie pie. venting is good. venting is good. venting is good.

       2004-04-25 15:06:00; i've been especially frustrated the few days, and so i've relied on coffee more than ever to keep me "uplifted." i do have to give myself kudos for trying to stay motivated. i've practiced my cello a ton this week, especially this weekend and actually had a good time. i'm still insisted on making my earlier decisions definitive - keeping with the plans. i had this big talk from jackie, my current cello teacher, a scolding as she called it, and she really got me going i guess. she says she knows i'm talented but have let so many things weigh me down. that's when it's time to fight she says.   laying off the sweets - i've been good the last couple of days, and i'd like to keep it that way for as long as i can. haven't done the yoga, but i have to tonight or else - something.   i haven't heard from amy even though i called her a couple of times this week. i hope she's just too busy to call. still, i have to do what i have to do with or without her.   kevin found out this week he has a enlarged heart. so far the doctors say he's fine, but they're still running tests and he, kevin, doesn't really know anything - the doctors haven't said much. it's common among african american men to have enlarged hearts, and or people with diabetes. i'm reminded of a conversation we had a few weeks ago about him feeling as though he will die early on in life. i think he might die soon, but i don't know, and of course, i don't wish that. right before jessica died we talked on the phone for a while. maybe god is allowing me this time to spend with him like the time I spent with jessica before she died. i shouldn't think that way. he's fine, and i'll stay away from horrible thoughts like that.   i really need to be about finding a second job right away if i'm going through with my plans. of course i'm terrified, but i feel justifed. things will be fine, i just need not freak out. find a job quick. walmart needs people all the time, or a grocery store. i want the second job to be a place where i can work at night.   i have to play for master class tomorrow. i hope it will go okay. i practiced more this week than all the weeks i've been here. actually, this would be normal practice routine.

      2004-04-23 10:11:00; i'm having one of those female "i hate my body" moments. haven't been doing the yoga as of late, and i'm afraid that's affected me emotionally in a very negative way. not feeling good in your own skin is one of the more uncomfortable feeling for me to struggle with. i've been letting the stomach hang loose and free wanting to get used to not slightly sucking in all the time. i don't even realize i'm doing that half the time. i suppose that also applies to my cello. i'm tense and i don't realize it until later and i have to force myself to relax, which also applies to the rest of my life. the constant struggle to be free. yes, i'm getting there slowly...slowly. grrrrr!!! i have an obsession with my body. perpetually looking in the mirror checking myself out and poking at myself. it's not so bad when I actually feel good about myself...the poking  i haven't talked to any of my friends recently. i've especially wanted to talk to amy and tell her of my plans for the summer and fall. for some reason i need her to approve, but last night i was thinking that i would do it anyway, because, of course it's only my decision to make.    so, I write my supposedly interesting music, and it's just that - interesting. it is if i say so myself, but i don't know who and how to get it to people who would understand or appreciate it - people with the same taste as mine whether it be bad or good. i wonder the point in writing when really no one i know really understands it - or they don't understand it according to my knowledge. three songs wait in the computer and i don't know if i even like them. maybe they should be finished any way, and the ones i don't like other people will like. but.....but i don't want to spend quality time trying to feed the meter. either it's accepted or rejected - point blank. i think the main problem i have is that i hae all these interesting ideas with no realy sense of how to develop them - always too far out in left field. something like that  i'm still cranky, and i honestly don't know why or what's makin gme this way. it'd be nice if i could just go somewhere and lay on the groound for goodness sake. just lay and be if only for a little while.    I think my day will go much better once i get some coffee. i'm extremely volatile.

      2004-04-21 14:51:00; April 19, 2004  I am writing this letter to let you know how glad and honored I am to have had the chance to work with you during the past few months. I appreciate your sharing your thoughts, feelings, and experiences so openly with me. I consider it a privilege to have gotten to know you during this time, and would like to share some thoughts about the strengths and positive qualities I think I've seen in you during our work together. These are merely my impresssions, and I offer them as a final part of our counseling together. I hope they are things you also prize within yourself and that I am simply commenting on things you already know. If not, I hope you consider them as things you can learn more about and embrace in yourself.   First, I want to thank you agina for sharing your music with me. One of the most unique things about my work with you was that I was able to learn about you through your music, as well as in the counseling room. I am honored that you felt able to share your CD with me. It gave me another way of learning about you. I experienced your music as unique, compelling, thought-provoking, and very honest. I believe these qualities describe my experience of you as a person, just as much as they describe my experience through you musically. I am impressed with your creativity and how you use it to express yourself.  I have experienced you as being very authentic, insightful, introspective, and honest. I appreciate your dedication to learn more about yourself, and to grow as a person. I have experienced you as someone who is always striving for greater understanding and perspective. You seem very open to a variety of experiences and ways of thinking. You seem to me to really want to know who you are and what you believe, and are constantly striving to figure those things out. A willingness to face such difficult questions takes a lot of courage, and I appreciate the way you strive to gain insight into how experiences both your past and present effect you and contribute to your current views and responses to life. You have been through a lot, yet you seem to continue to strive to become a better person and to make and find meaning for yourself. To me, this attitude and willingness communicate a great deal of resilience.   I have also found you to be very resourceful. You seem to search out things that will help you and incorporate these things into your life. This was clear when you sought out counseling before and after coming to USC. This proactiveness seems very important, as you continue to take care of yourself physically, emtionally, and spiritually. As I read back through my notes, things I noticed were yoga, journaling or writing poetry and songs, enjoying cooking for yourself and eating well, making friends with your inner child, finding positive people to have in your life, reading books you find inspirational or helpful, and listening to music that makes you feel good. The variety of things you found are impressive to me, and in mu opinion, show that you are actively looking for ways to take care of yourself and improve yourself and your life.   I am sad that USC and South Carolina were not a good fit for you, but I'm glad you have found meaning in being here and see some constructive pupose in your coming here. It seems to me that you have used this difficult time as a chance to grow and understand yourself better. I know being here was not easy, but I have seen you do some important things to make the best of the situation, such as getting a job at the library, giving music lessons, getting involved in Lynn's group, and preserving your friendship with Kevin. I hope you will find the next place you go more of a good fit than USC and South Carolina, in general. I wish for you firneds who will accept and encourage you and work that you find meaningful and allows you to use your strengths and talents. I hope you will allow yourself to ask for what you need from others in terms of support. I also wish you clarity as you continue to explore the issues that you are unsure about.   As I wsa reading through my notes, I came across the session where you told me about the beautiful rainbow you saw. To you, this rainbow symbolized hope and comfprt. Ihope you will keep this meaningful image in mind as you move forward into the next part of your life and beyond. I pray that you will use your unique strengths and positive qualities to continue to help yourself when you face difficult situations in the future. You are truly a special person.  Again, it has been a pleasure working with you and getting to know you. I wish you all the best.   Sincerely,  Carmella

      2004-04-21 13:05:00; today was the last counseling session i'll have with c. we spent most of the time together talking about what i've gotten out the experience. i've learned so much about myself since we started working together last october, and i know i've done some impressive growing.  what i've learned:  1) i have to stop being so hard on myself. i don't have to be perfect and i shouldn't expect myself to be.  2) life is full of adversity. having a hard time doesn't mean god's trying to kill me. 3) my past is just that - my past. i don't have to keep going back there. my family isn't what it was. home isn't what it used to be - realize it's positive now.  4) my life is not a disappointment. i'm lucky to have the opportunity to live my dream. how many people actually get to do that? not many.  5) when and how i got started with music doesn't matter. i'm still a good, talented musician who wants to influence others in a positive way. it is my gift, and absolutely no one can play the way i play. i am unique. i am musical, and free from inhibitions. i will not allow depression to rob me from being expressive. 6) i'm a good person. i'm a good friend. i love, and i live to love. i am worthy of love and affection. i give, and i deserve to get in return. i am a wonderful peron.  7) i believe god loves me just as much as he loves everyone else. he doesn't play favorites. 8) i will stop comparing myself to other people.  9) i have confidence in myself 10) this should be number one, but i really do love myself despite how i might feel at times. 11) i am interested in my own well being. I will take good care of myself emtotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically.  12) life is good. 13) life is good 13) life is good 14) i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i CAN do it. I  can DO it. I can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. i can do IT. i can do it. i can do it. i can do it. I CAN DO IT! 15) I CAN DO IT WELL!!  just a few things I pick along the way this year. with all the things that's happened, maybe i should be thankful it happened here and not in a place that is completely foreign from where i'm used to being. being in school helped me have the counseling i needed. i had the time to examine some things, and take steps toward changing. things are so much better now, and i should allow myself the understanding to know and live it.   i love my life. that's the most positive i've been in a very long time.

       2004-04-20 15:03:00;  this morning i had the inevitable talk with the landlady about the rent, which was not the first time i've had trouble with that. having a roommate wth cheaper rent will be a good thing for a little while until i get back up. i had to tell her that i was moving out before she evicted me. i knew it was coming - she asked when i would be finished with school. that was my cue - no introduction needed. by the end of this month i'll be in a new place with kitties. a cat would be nice. something to rub on.

       2004-04-19 08:19:00;spent the night at Ks, met a new friend. I hadn't laughed and joked like that with anyone in a very long time. Makes me wonder if the meds. are finally resting in my system. confirms I really do need them. I would like to hang out more. not necessarily with more people, just more. I feel a little less moody these days, but I still don't trust myself - the comfort - never having it with most people. my new friend and I were looking at the ny times. there's so much in there. so much of the stuff I'd like to see or be involved in. that's how I know I don't belong here- I look in the local paper for things to do so being alone doesn't mean I have to stay at home counting the blemishes in the walls, and there's not one thing that interests me. no plays, no poetry - just tasteless music from the local scene. no, I didn't go to the music festival this weekend. THe more I thought about it the more I realized I would hate being there reliving the younger version of myself. Besides, I couldn't imagine spending $25 to be bored. I could do that for free in the comfort of my own home which could be dangerous sometimes and I try to avoid that these days.  what would I be like if I didn't suffer from depression? Would I like myself or even recognize myself? sometimes, I wonder if I'm too afraid to just drop it off though I know damned well it could never be that easy- I"ve tried. eek! I remember benjamin telling me I could turn it off like a light switch. wow!! now that takes talent. the imaginary people are pointing at me telling me that I'm screwed up - newsflash- I think I've shook them off for the time being, but they'll be back. I'm starting to realize this is something I will always struggle with and that's fine by me, and anyway, I'm not the one who's screwed up. everyone else is but they're too stupid to know it becuase they never really look at themselves.   THis past week I decided I'm not straight, gay or bi. I just am. I am and that's all there has to be, so I shouldn't have anymore issues, right? it's settled. doesn't matter anyway. there's no person looming in the empty spaces of my mind, and so I fill it with smoke. I fill my chest with smoke, my eyes and my heart. everthing hides behind the artificial cloud. everything that is anything.

      2004-04-18 16:12:00;  just logged away a million books, and I feel pretty good about it. tried to call C. and A. this morning and neither of them answered. it was ok at the time, but later I started to get a little sour and annoyed. this week is my last counseling session with CM. I'm supposed to be thinking of the most appropriate way to say goodbye. I don't know what that is. I knew it would happen though. either she or I would have to leave. it's a part of the system. I really will miss her and maggie her dog. I'm not so sure what a good goodbye would mean for me. I can't throw my arms around her and hug her, or cry about how things will be different now. I do know, that I she understood me and was very sincere in caring which I always appreciated. I'm looking forward to the next phase in the healing process. I think it'll be very interesting.   I had a good weekend although I can't say I did anything other than drive around in my car, and rent movies. didn't practice, didn't finish the music I'm writing, but somthing happened somewhere that made me feel as if I did important, worthwhile things.   I've a hard time not thinking about certain people in my past who make me feel bad about myself and angry. it's the people I went to church with in TN. It bothers me to think about them, and know what they thought about me. I hate that it still affects me emotionally. I hate that I still can't get around them sometimes. It's trying to bring me down, and you know, I just can't let that happen anymore. Those people are gone and they will continue to be gone forever and ever and ever. I'm only thinking about the future and what that has to offer me.   Urghhhh. The science of things.

      2004-04-17 12:41:00; didn't mean to come in today and end up working but, it's cool and I can always use the money. The day is absolutely wonderful, and I'm excited there will still be time to enjoy the richness of the sun at the end of my shift. I had a talk with my mum this morning, and it went quite well. lots of "I'm proud of yous" and prayers for health and my future. I'm so lucky to have her as a mother. sometimes I get so selfish about feeling lonely and unloved that I forget about the people, my family and friends, who really do love me unconditionally - who stay active in my life and give me encouragement.  plans are around the corner. more and more thinking. more and more doing, which is where I want to be- doing all the time. this summer will be a very busy one, but one I'm looking forward to. there's so much excitement in the air I can feel it on my skin and taste it on my tongue. I'm very happpy these days. there's a ball of energy circling in my stomach...I'm charged, I'm finally fit to run and laugh, be. The five year old is out and is ready to experience life.

      2004-04-16 11:07:00  last night I played a gig at this medical society thing. it was fucking hi larious. all these drunk doctors were drunk off their asses - giddy -complimenting us in their drunken slurs - probably off work for the first time in a while. it was a good night, paid well, and I got free wine - my thing. it amazed me that so many of them are as young as I am. It was nice feeling the freedom I've been wanting. There were no inhibitions - it was fun!!   Today is friday, and I'm looking forward to doing something for myself over the weekend. There's this outdoor music festival thing and a few cool bands playing tonight. I think I might hop over and hang there for the rest of the night. It's a wonderful day, and I can't think of a cooler way to spend it.  I thought I'd spend today not complaining about all the music stuff and the rest of my life stuff. There's only so many things I can say about that anyway without getting tired of myself or redundant.   So, rock bands. Better Than Ezra - I don't know if they can be considered rock, but they're playing tonight. I saw them when I was a freshman which seems so long ago and not so long ago at the same time: a completly different person from then. I'm less stiff, if you can believe that. Really, I am....serious.  just a couple of weeks of school and things are looking up. looking up. looking up. I think I';; spend the weekend writing some more "concept music" and I actually plan to practice.....scales.....etudes.....music? I'm all about scales and etudes!! fun:():  huh

       2004-04-13 17:39:00 I had a great time visiting with my friend last night. It's been a while since I've hung out with someone other than myself. It was refreshing.   We talked a little about this journal, and why I'm doing it and what I hope to get out of it. i don't know, maybe there's a chance that some person will read this and be able to relate and understand where I'm coming from - maybe get somthing in return. IThe forum is a little bit hard to get past - a little cheesy at times, because I have expectations from this, and I keep looking for that thing that will pull me in and I'll think AHAH. It'll be nice when I get that. I'll hang around a bit longer and decide if this is actually worth my time. I'm excited when I come here, though, I'm excited before I get here.  I wanted to talk to my friend k. about moving, but he's one of the people I'm keeping the info from. i still don't know what I'll do in the end. I'd hate to make a million plans and not see them through. I'd rather not tell anyone just in case it doesn't work out and have to resend. I hated that last semester - wanting to leave - saying I would - and ending up staying.   It's all good though, I guess.

      2004-04-12 13:35:00;  I'm feeling quite testy today. there's a hotbed of anger brewing somewhere in the pit of mystomach, and I know who I can take it out on. I know where I want to go with it. I'm so selfish. No I'm not.   I'm waiting for the day to be over so I can go home and not be bothered by anyone. when I'm like this, i have to go into a cave until the quake dies down. There's nothing left for me to do but create - compose - record - play. I'm inspired the most when my mood is this way, and everyone wonders why my material takes on the tone it takes on.  I played my cello a bit today. haven't touched it since Thurdsday. I'm so angry all the damn time. I'm angry at it, at myself, at the people around me who seem to be getting all the things I've worked so hard for. I'm jealous, I'm enraged. Everyone else seems to be doing well. their lives are taking off while I haven't even started. my life it still. I'm waiting for the signal. The weather is always too turbulent for take-off. On the other side of the world, where everyone else seems to be, it's a perfect day - no clouds, 70 degrees and a steady breeze. I'm struggling and nothing's happening. I hate that I'm so fucked up because that just means I can't do anything until I'm not fucked up anymore, and who the hell knows when that'll be? I just want to work and be successful. I'm not lazy, I'm not complacent, I'm a hard worker, and all I want is something to show for it. that's it. it's got to be my turn some time. not anytime soon, I guess. 50 sounds like a good round number. For some reason I know I'm meant to have a hard life. I'm meant to be emotionally mixed up, confused, angry and narcisisstic. there's got to be something I'm not doing. thinking positively hasn't helped. looking ahead doesn't help. staying where I'm gets me nowhere.   I don't know what to do to change things. I'm in counseling for gods sake!! I mean, for years now I've done everything I'm "supposed" to do to bring my level of happiness up, and get my life going. there's some trick i'm missing. I'm afraid I'll be like this for the rest of my life = always pretending - always trying to be in a good mood. waiting for the medication to kick in. huh. I'm at a lost - even god doesn't help.

      2004-04-12 08:59:00; I stayed home this weekend -easter. I didn't talk to anyone or do anything. My attempt at being outside was driving around looking for something to do - a park, anything. I rented a couple of movies, and spent last night recording a new song - brand new as of last night. That made my weekend - gave it meaning.   saturday I visited my inner child. it was hard finding her in hiding. when I finallly got her, she wraps herself around my leg like a child away from it's mother for the first time. It took some time but I finally convinced her that I'd take care of her. she'll be okay. I wept. We both did.  I"ve thought a lot about going home for the summer. I don't know if it'd be a good thing for me at the moment with all the conflicts I'm having with myself and with my mother and religion and the whole of everything else. I just can't decide what I should do. Anything would be ok except for going home. I can't do that, but maybe it's what I need to do. I know I want to work on myself - for healing - but I need that to be on my terms and not what my mother thinks I should do. Somewhere, sometime, my thoughts should count for something - should be validated.   writing for me is this huge release. Music is how I speak the best - I authenticate myself through it. I'm scared at leaving even if it's only for a little while. I don't want a "little while" to turn into a long and winding road. I'd have to veer off at some point.   I haven't talked to Carol in a while. I don't suppose I will - not right now at least. All weekend I wanted to talk to Amy and tell her my plans. Maybe she can talk some sense into me. If I stay here any longer I'll down spiral more. I don't think I ever made any real effort to be here, mostly becusae I didn't want to be here in the first place. I don't want to plant any roots. It'd end up staying forever - like Murfreesboro. That wasn't so bad, but I didn't want to end up in another place like it. It had it's place, and now it's time for an atmosphere change. I'm scared as hell though. I wish I could go home, but I don't want to be there either. I don't want being there to mean I have to be with Eric in any extraplatonic manner. I don't want it to mean my mother is running my life. She will inevitably. It's her job. There's got to be another solution.   gotta be

      2004-04-09 15:13:00; since I'll have gone two days without updating, I'll just say as much as I can to make up for the lost time.   My mom called last night. we went a while without talking, mostly a misunderstanding - the phone works now. she's the worrying mom who needs to know what my plans are - I told her she's a little much for me right now - too much worrying and the nagging that goes along with it. I didn't mention the nagging - the constant asking, but I think she got the picture. I'm still making plans for the summer, but I'd feel better once I have everything in place. I'm thinking of subleasing a place with someone i know, but it's up in August, and I'm not so sure that will be enough time for me to have what I need to move. It's not that I have much - I don't really own anything - I've always gone against that so I don't have to drag it all around. I'm not done moving yet.   as the weekend approaches I can feel myself getting more and more frustrated. probably because I'll be alone all weekend long. I'm used to that - being alone. I live that way, I travel that way - the only place I'm not alone is at university and of course I'm expected to be social while there. I think it's the whole family atmosphere. its a family weekend, and I have none to retreat to, not even as an option I could turn down. Once I'm thinking about family I'm thinking about being alone in the uncomfortable way - I have a hard time with that one. there are moments when I can get by without feelling anything for this "thing" if I need something this bad, to fill a hole, it'll never come. I'm not half a person, a decimal. I am as complete as I can get. should stop being so hard on myself. am I the abnormal one here? I think everyone else is the problem.  everyday all of my thoughts are somewhere in chicago. I question my sincerity. I want to call amy and tell her I'm coming, but I can't just yet. I think maybe she'll try and talk me out of it, or ask me what my real intensions are. I don't know what they are. I just remember being there and loving it. No, it's not about her. although I'm not so sure I would go there if she weren't there. I just figured it'd be nice to be somewhere where I new at least one person. It's comforting - and I can't move to NEW York. I'm thinking about moving home for a while so i can save and move with less hassle, but home. Oh home. I don't know if I can handle being there. I don't want to be forced to go to church, or feel guilty for not going, or have "the conversation" for the millionth time.   and I digress. my hands hurt.

       2004-04-09 12:10:00;  easter is this weekend. I'm not unsually excited about it. Actually, the fact that I didn't even realise it was this weekend astounds me in some way. I believe in the almight and his son, but you know I haven't been to church in a while, and I don't plan to go this sunday unless I feel particularly convicted or compelled. besides, where would I go exactly? I'm not familiar with any of the churches in this town, and I am no respecter of any denomination. I've been a member of or have gone to so many different denominations in the past that they all eventually carry the same weight - okay, well maybe not catholicism.  god and I have been having some issues lately, but they've gotten better. I don't feel so much like I'm going to rot in hell for all of eternity, and I don't think his sole purpose is to punish me for any and everything sinful.   somwhere between elementary school to late teens I decided to live in a religious bubble - it kept me sane in the midst of crazy parents. I believed until my fist were red and my eyes were popping with veins. I read the bible with love/conviction "If I don't read tonight God won't bless me." seems everyone gets it but me. yes, it all looks better through the looking glass - as longs as my eyes are not the ones gazing.  I'm 27 years old - wait 26, just now starting to figure this whole thing out. Something really interesting must be lurking in the shadows waiting for daylight.   Could I be a librarian? The thought has come to mind to try to go for library science. I don't think it'll hurt anything, but I still wonder if I'm meant to be a cellist on the professional level, or if I'm meant to do something else. For so long I've said that if I were interested in something else besides music I would go for it. I think I may have found something I like. It's a nonthreatening environment. Nothing about this scares me, and that scares me. It could be that yet again I'm running away, when really I'm trying to find myself once and for all. or at least have a clue as to who I am so I can spend the rest of my life working on it. It's as if I'm waiting for some divine answer to fall into my lap, or tattoo itself to my wrist. I'm digging my foot into the ground on this one. I should give it a rest for a while. think about not thinking.

      2004-04-08 20:52:00; so, I've randomly looked at other people's entries, and I wonder if other people would view my thoughts in the same way I view theirs. Of course, we all feel the way we feel, and we all do what we do, but you know, I was hoping that I could learn more about people other than who they're dating today, this last week, or whether or not they had homework. However, I do consider that the things I mull over could be completely meaningless to anyone who may read this. ...and then I consider how utterly boring my life might be from the onlooker's point of view. Classical music, reading, writing, rareclub going, drunk getting. It's hard to find people I have things in common with. There are many things I enjoy, but the combination of this wonderful thing plus wonderful company is like throwing a stone into the ocean and then trying to retrieve it. The odds of that happening...not so much. It's all good. It's all good. I'll keep doing my thing.

      2004-04-08 16:33:00; Okay, so I'm at home today basically just chilling, and the occassion "freak out" because I keep having this eery feeling that I'm supposed to be somewhere, and of course the equally frightening feeling that some creditor is going to call and harrass me if I should dare answer the phone.   It's a dreary day outside, and I haven't taken my medication yet - after which I'll be happy again, more energized more productive and less groggy.   I've spent most of the day thinking something really wonderful will happen, but I know it's a set up. I'm thinking she'll want to talk and we'll be wonderful, together - I'll be happy? I don't know if it's possible - being happy with someone. I try to imagine what that would be like and what that would mean for me. I think it means I don't have to work so damned hard to be different - make myself new. I've made so many strides to "get better" though. I'm here, and I'm learning, and I'm willing to make the changes, to better myself and my current situation - make more money, cook for myself, by myself flowers or easter candy- lots and lots and lots of candy for the addict. I'm doing all the things to make me love myself more so I can possibly love someone else. Maybe it isn't that I don't love myself, it's that I've listened to people tell me that I don't love me. I think I do, more now than I ever have. It's like I'm trying to convince myself.   I bought some groceries today - a little self esteem booster. I did yoga last night, a little self esteem booster, tomorrow I'll do something with my hair - self esteem.   Yesterday in counseling I said I think the proposed moved to Chicago will open some important doors, Like somehow my life will know to improve because the environment itself will be an improvement. The signals will all mix together, and I'll be on this huge cloud overlooking everything I've struggled to overcome. This step is so important. It's a huge statement in my life. It says, "I will not let being afaid keep me from doing what I need to do." The attitude starts before I leave. The cello will become less and less of an enemy. It'll be less and less painful for me.   There was this professor yesterday who talked to me about children and language and syntex in relation to music. Kids just do what the hell their told, period. Grown-ups think to damned much. I think to damned much. My special one person project is to find a way to get back that thing we all had when we were kids. We just did whatever the hell we did and we didn't care who was watching or why. We didn't have any real expectations - we just did. That's my mission.   O.K. back to work.

      2004-04-07 13:28:00;  Ok, so I go to couseling. It's not that big of a deal. My best friend goes to counseling, and believe it or not that's not the attraction. She's been a great friend - one of the few people who understands me - the one person I share most of my life with with reckless abandon. I never feel like she judges me. Maybe that's the attraction. Plus, we can talk for hours on end about music, which is a huge part of both our lives, and other things that make absolutely no sense what so ever. Since I've moved 7 hours away, I don't get to talk to her as much, and that can be hard sometimes, because we spent so much time together during our school work week - like every second. Right now, I don't really have a friend like that, but that's ok for now. I'm sure I can use the time to focus on myself.  I'm really excited about Amy coming to visit me this summer. I really don't want to put any expectations on our friendship, so I'm trying to keep that conversation we had about us in mind. Any, I still enjoyed writing the song for her- I'm in a writing mood lately. I can't wait to get home so I can do more recording and other stuff. I'm also hoping I can spend more time writng poetry and other things. It'd be nice if I could shurn out a short story or something like that.   I"ve been talking to my counselor about this whole freedom thing I've been thinking endlessly about. I feel so close to it. Last night though, I was a little scared, becaused I started to get a little depressed - in the middle of the night I guess that's ok, it's normal to be that way sometimes. I should expect the occassional blue mood.   I'm reading this, and I wonder if I sound like a 15 year old.

      2004-04-07 10:42:00;  I went to see a friend give a presentation on Creole music - scholarly neglect of this musical tradition, why it's important. I'm glad I had a chance to go. I have a lot of family in New Orleans, and beside I enjoy learning about something that could be directly related to me/ or perhaps indirectly.   Tonight, I have my engagement with Lou Rawls, which I can, at this very moment, care less for, but I need the rent money. I have no idea what the occassion is, but I'm planning to get something out of it. I've only seen him do stuff associated with the NAACP or life insurance. This should be interesteing to say the least. I've never been fond of his singing. I am a little concerned that I haven't been able to see, which makes sightreading very difficult. I don't think the music will be very hard, but everything looks so unclear to me.   I went to bed a 8:00 p.m. last night and woke up, the first time around, 5:40 with a train horn in the not so distant background.   I've got to go to couseling. I almost forgot.

      2004-04-06 17:59:00;  yesterday's rehearsal wasn't so bad. my stand partner did agree to play the solo stuff, so that's a load off my mind. I don't have an ego. I can sit assistant principal, no problem.  I spent much of today recording the song I wrote for Amy. I think I like it, though it's hard to tell after just completing it. I have to ruminate and ponder and think about it - they're all the same but different. Really, I need to clear my head, and stop thinking so much. I am so full of emotions - so many things happening inside me. I'm afraid to give place to any of these thoughts, not that their bad, but more so that I should just concentrate on other things. I know I have expectations, now, that I can't give in to. Much too much to handle.  I have to focus solely on myself and the things I need to be doing right now.   The days are getting longer, and I seem to be getting happier, perhaps because the sun is now befriending us all - no longer guarded by those dark clouds. the wind is less whipping and more gentle. I opened the blinds in my house today for the first time is a long, long time. There are messages on my machine that I have yet to listen to. They all want something. No one calls just to say hello - well, except Chat who seems to be my saving grace at the moment., and I can't forget my mum - who still reminds me that I have to have my life figured out before school ends and summer starts. Humph. She's a good mum - she means well, and I supposed all mums worry about their kids.   today was a good day.   i have to keep reminding myself that school is almost over, and I don't have to do this anymore, unless I have rendered my self insane and school is my asylum. Something like that.   I'm praying for a good lesson tomorrow depite the fact that I haven't practiced much all week, and it's now frustrating that I can't see the music because I need new specs, but that's all there is and I can't be upset. It's alright. I should get some candy and go home. I'll probably practice better there.

      2004-04-05 12:51:00; I think I'm getting used to this journaling thing. I guess it helps being in front of a computer almost all the time. I needed to practice this weekend, but of course I didn't. Last week I convinced the conductor of our school orchestra that I shouldn't play the solos in the up coming concert. I really don't have the strength to pull it off, or feel like I will do a good job. At least not right now. I'm still working on the confidence thing. I'll be working on that for some time. I'm thinking a year. I can't believe I just gave myself a time limit.   My friend Amy said she's coming to visit me from Chicago some time over the summer. That would be incredibly awesome!!! I met her this summer working as a counselor at Blue Lake in Michigan. I didn't like being there, but it beat the hell out of working some retail or fastfood joint, plus I got to spend my summer with my best friend Jennifer before I moved away. Having them both there with me was great, helpful, sustainging. I started writing a song for Amy. I think I've finally come up something cool. Something that would be worthy of her attention. I should record some cello with that.  In a little while I'll have to conduct a master class with the other cellists in the orchestra. O.k. now, I'm struggling to learn the music I didn't practice over the weekend, because it'll be obvious to them I have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm at work now. I'll have an hour gap - I can get by. I'm really hoping my stand partner will play the solo stuff. I don't want to. Last week I played like shit, I even took my meds. just before I played in hopes that I would be ok. The conductor gave the orchestra a speech about practicing solo parts before rehearsal. I practiced the part, it just didn't sound good. I could've been humiliated, but I did that last week in a concert - so I chose to be mad instead.

      2004-04-05 08:10:00;  It's barely after 8:00a.m. and I'm slighly awake and getting more so as I continue to realize how cold my body is even inside of two shirts and a leather jacket. I'm in a library. It's where I work and probably the best thing that's happened to me in a while, or since I moved to SC. It's a calm place in the music school where I'm currently working on a certificate. Here, I don't feel the anxiety I place on myself. The pressure to perform is not an issue.   I came here for school, and I'm slowly learning not to be as I won't be returning in the fall. I feel as though I'm already done. I don't need this. I don't need any of this anymore. School has been a crutch for me. Two degrees later I still can't get up enough courage to leave. I was the only one who didn't know I was hiding there croutched on the floor in the corner with my hands over my head refusing to come outside. I think I've finally opened the door, and when school is over in a few of weeks, I'll be completely immerged in the beginnings of what could possible be a good life.   Music has been my life for so long - the only thing I really know how to do and have gotter quite good at punishing myself when I don't like how I've done something, which is all the time. I think being in school causes me to worry too much about what other people think - whether or not THEY think I'm good enough. You see, I am a narcissist, because according to me, everyone spends their time thinking about how aweful I am. This isn't the environment for me. I have to remove my self for a while, for how ever long it takes to be sure of myself, to not put so much goddamn weight on what I think everyone thinks of me. A lot of thinking, I know.   So, I'm excited about new prospects, rediscoving my love for music, learning how to appreciate myself, value my playing. usically, I can pick and choose what I want to be a part of. I plan to be much more adventurous and explore genres outside of classical music as far as my primary instrument goes. Hopefully, in a few months I'll be moving to Chicago or some place like it. I have an amazing friend there who I'll be happy to get to know better. I'll have to work two jobs, and I'll complain alot, but it'll be worth it in the end.  that's enough for now

      2004-04-04 17:46:00 Today, I decided to clean my house. I mean for real clean. It's one of the reasons I can't seem to get comfortable there. It's not messy, it just looks dirty no matter what, cause it's old, and there are the occassional cockroaches, which scare the hell out of me - I hate killing them. No, it's not the killing that I hate, it's the crunch and the white residue that I hate.   I've tried keeping a journal before, but I can never seem to continue with them after a certain amount of time. I get bored I guess, so I thought I'd try this to see how it works. It'd be interesting to see how often or how long I stick with it.   I was talking to my friend on the phone earlier today, and I asked her if I have communication problems. She said yes, like yeah, I was expecting to hear something else. Thiss made me think. I don't talk to most people, especially when I'm a part of a large group of conversationalists. What does that mean? I'll have to time to figure that one out later....

      the weekend is over, and i can get back to work. there's something oddly somber about the weekends that make me long for the work week. i find myself clammoring for ways to keep myself occupied, not thinking to much in one direction. i'm glad i was able to get some work done, quality work, practicing. i feel so much more apt at being a good musician. somehow motivated to be more consistent, which has always been a sore spot for me. i think i could be a genius if not for this weakness. i'm growing more and more to love scales and etudes. i feel my growing in them.   i'll be glad when jennifer's home so i can go see her. i'd love to spend a little time in her space ocuppying her senses. i have this strange hunger inside of me that won't dissipate. i think it's time for me to visit my friends especially. i miss my mother, but that's another issue altogether.   i forgot to mention my brother sidon sent me a gift for my birthday - a gold necklace with silver intertwining. i wish i could send him something for his. i think i decided to burn some cds for him - the radiohead collection i have plus a few things i've written. he might be one of the few who could halfway understand my ideas and such. it's all good. i've learned to just love my stuff and my ideas even if i'm the only one who does. i'm the only one who matters anyway.

      i was talking to a friend of mine about the letters i'm writing to my state representative, the first about gays and lesbians right to marry, and the second on the confederate flag that sits on the front lawn of the state capitol. i understand not everyone sees this as a symbol of hate, and i'm honestly open to those opinions, but i also have to acknowledge that while there was a time this flag did not represent hatred and bigotry, it does now, and probably will forever. it makes me think of the swaztika (sp?) and those people who deny the impact it has as a strong representation of what the jews endured as a result of the nazis. it didn't begin as a sign of hatred. it actually meant something good - the acutal meaning fails me right now - the truth of the matter is, it uncovers a lot of wounds those people and the people who fought for them suffers(ed). I find it appalling that people could be so insensitive as to allow that to continue. It's a horrible thing. whatever good the flag stood for at the first is completely undermined by the hatred it now represents not only for me, but for many hundreds and thousands of people. how can we allow just a few people who are determined to hang to horrid thing decide it should wave from the front lawn of this state capital- which is supposed to be for the protection and rights of all the people represented in the state. i'm just at a lost for these people.

      got my car back - a $400.00 gift from the mechanic, or shall i say to the mechanic. his gift to me was the list for additional things that need to be fixed. yay ten year old car!!! i'm not ready for another one. not ready. i'm just glad i don't have to figure out how i'll get around.   so i'm not playing the shumann cello concerto. it's disappointing because i was very much looking forward to it. he actually said i should play dvorak before i play the schumann. i think i disaggree. i've listened to it a number of times and the dvorak a few times, and well, hands down, the dvorak is harder - it expects more bow technique. the schumann is musically more challenging i would say. so, this leaves me to think my teacher doesn't believe in my musical capabilities, which is where i flourish. actually, except for sautille, which i can now do thank you very much, i am very apt in bow technique. there!!!!!  i'll not complain too much about my teacher and the fact that we has every right to think what he thinks. he just doesn't know me musically, at all. no one here does, and yes, that would be my fault. i flaked out a lot, and, of course, trying to commit suicide and being a complete zombie for almost the entire year didn't really help my reputation. nope, not one bit. so, if i'm to be here, i'm just going to have to prove to myself again, that i'm a musical beast, dammit!!! I am a musical beast. besides, i can't believe i take lessons from a guy whose entire approach to making music is scientific, not that i can't learn from that, but still. he hasn't moved me. michael, jackie, benjamin, and even julia on the other hand, are musical geniuses.  huh!!!

      i have a couple of ideas i'd like to explore, one of which has been on my mind for quite some time now. i enjoy composing music, but as of late i've hit some sort of rut/ a baracade if you will. i'm very interested in playing my cello and singing at the same time, but i don't know how to go about doing this. do i write the cello part first, or come up with a vocal melody and then score the cello part underneath that. Actually, that sounds like a great idea for getting off the ground. the second is, what do i write about, or sing about. how do i do this.   first lyric: gave you up at the dinner table   i came up with that last night night as i was working on something else, an article on gender, thinking about where i fit, and how i've tried to fit into these small crevaces (sp?) where i don't belong.   slip into these crevasses - also a nice one.   i shouldn't try too hard to make something happen. it should be natural. that's my thought.   my car is going to cost me about $400.00 dollars. luckily i have it, but i was also wanting to cure some of my financial ailments with that money. of course, something would go wrong, but i'm hoping i can fix things more and more - decision decisions. i still need to get things together. stop talking. it makes me feel guilty.

      i went and talked to my cello teacher, and i feel awful because i gave him some spiel about sticking around, when i have no idea exactly what i'm doing or how i should get there. i'm sick of feeling cloudy and unsure of things. i'm sick of the pressure coming from my mom to get my life together. i think i can make things work around here for one more year and try to get things together for a doctorate. i think i agree with carol. i should take it easy and try to just get through everything. i'll be fine in the end, i just need to figure out how things are going to work. i know my mother thinks i'm making horrible decisions for myself, but i know i'm not. i got a birthday card from her yesterday. "Am I dissappoointed in some of your decisions....yes, but I love you whatever." it's as of i've become a dissappointment her which is disappointing to me, but you know, at some point you just have to do what you have to do no matter what that is no matter what other people think of it. i have to remind myself of that everyday. even this morning as i'm putting on my clothes, i'm concerned about what someone may think of my clothes. are they to masculine. can i be pinned as a butch lesbian. i don't want to be a butch lesbian. i just want to be - femme, but my version of it doesn't square up to other people's version, and that's totally fine with me even if i have to start over everyday with that thought. it's okay. everything's okay. i have to be fine with the sacrifices i need to make to have what i want in the future - just a comfortable life.   the resumes are being printed off today, and they are going to the people they need to go to. my car is being taken care of today and not tomorrow or two days from now. it has to be done today. right now.....

      today is my birthday. i'd like to congratulate myself for successfully completing another year. one of my best friends Robin came here from out of town to have lunch with me. i'm so glad she came. it really added to my day, my month, my last few months. i feel so much less lonely. i still miss my friends in a huge way. i don't think even i realized how much i needed them or took for granted they'd always be around. it's hard not having anyone to really talk to. people who are around when i need to talk to them. i had a great time visiting with her in this quaint little coffee house joint. it was really cute. she really liked it there. she seemed so full of life today. i feel so full of life today.   today my mom called and a wished me a happy birthday - did i say this earlier? - and gently reminded me that i need to get a job, and that she realizies was born gay, but we're all born sinners. thanks. thanks alot. great to hear that on my birthday. then as i was leaving my car wouldn't start and i had to get my roommate to get me to school so i could meet with robin and get to work.   i'm not letting this minor detail stop me from having a good day!!! it's been so much better than i could have thought it'd be. i'm in a descent mood, and maybe it's the coffee, but i'll take it anyway i can get it. coffee is my friend.  i decided to write an article about gender roles in the modern society. as of late i've been really interested int the topic. I'm hoping to put a liberal/liberating spin on the subject. somehow i need to narrow it down a little so it won't be so consuming. maybe just about women since i'm more interested in women's issues. i've read bitch magazine, and girlfriends. one's lesbian, and the other is feminist. they were both interesting. i hope to be able to contribut to bitch someday. that would be very cool.

      i realized a few moments ago i haven't talked about my cello very much, which is funny, because it's one of my constant thoughts.   i started playing when i was thirteen - about thirteen years ago. i've worked very hard to be where i am, and although it's a good place, i offen feel bad that i'm not doing something grandiose. i'm a perfectionist, and believe-it-or-not that can sometimes make me lazy. i know i'll never be what i want which can be depressing so why even try. wrong attitude i know, but i have it. actually i take that back. perfectionism doesn't make me lazy, it's the depression. sometimes is seizes me and i can't move or think. i'm actually taking meds now because the depression became horrible and i had to do something about it. if not, i don't think i'd be here today to talk about it. i'm getting a performer's certificate at usc. i just finished my master's degree in performance a couple of weeks ago. it makes me sad that my degree holds no importance in the real world. i'm principal cellist of the usc orchestra - last season at least. who knows what this season will be like. last semester was horrible. i'm still putting the pieces back together after my attempt to off myself. i don't think i'll ever do that again. counseling has been a good thing for me. it helps me with my music. so many musicians suffer from depression - artists in general. i named my cello george from a bugs bunny cartoon. i'm slowly getting back into the swing of things as far as practicing goes. i feel much better. still working with my ever changing moods - depression, but at least i can work now. i'm looking forward to learning schumann cello concerto and hopefully bach suite IV. there are so many things to jab on and on about. i hope i'll include more thoughts about george and how he's affected my life. it's been a wonderfully hard journey, and it hasn't gotten any easier. i hope it never does!

      jennifer's in the hospital. hallucinations. sometimes i don't understand these quick decisions. seems everyone is quick to jump on the "let's put jennifer in the hospital" bandwagon. i wish they wouldn't do that or that she wouldn't do it to herself. at least not so many times. i'm just concerned it'll be hard for her to get work someday with all the mental hospitalizations possible on record. i thought it'd be nice to visit with her this weekend, but i'm starting to see that won't be possible. i won't be able to spend any time with her assuming she's still there when i get there.   there used to be demons out to get me. maybe i was hallucinating, but i don't think so. I'm not even sure i believe in hallucinating. i think we are allowed to see the inside world sometimes - maybe good, maybe horrific. i think i'll coin that term for myself.   the last couple of weeks have been very trying for me. i'm trying to stay "up" emotionally. i'm trying very hard to remain occupied - keep my mind on things that are lifting.   i went to church this weekend. i think i like litugical churches. i think i want to go to one. this particular church is lutheran - i thought it was catholic. mimi goes there sometimes. i just wanted to see what it's like. is lutheran catholic? i have no idea. there's a presbyterian church i'd like to visit. i still find it baffling the "conservative" churches are more liberal in mind set and the "contempory" churches are so conservative.   about the liturgical church. i like hearing classical music. it puts me in a quiet, still kind of worship. everything has a particular meaning, although i don't necesarily want to visit a church that doesn't deviate from the strict rules. I wish all the songs weren't hymns. anyway. i hope i find a place where i can belong and still feel free to be myself whatever that is.   that's all for now

      yesterday.i had a little talk with this girl kelly who works in the library with me. i told her all kinds of stuff. i guess it's been a while since i've really talked to someone and really needed to desperately, although the conversation didn't happen out of desperation. i was genuinely happy she wanted to listen to me - glad to see that seriious look on her face - vein stretched way across her forehead as if she was listening with such a grandiose intensity that her face could crack right in front of me - almost never true for me. i actually rambled. something i haven't done in a while, and then the conversation ended. she had work to do. my shift ended almost three hours ago but i'm still here. yet again, i don't want to go home, but at least this time i'm not sad about it, and at least i feel a little less pathetic because of it. we, kelly and i, talked about my communicatin problems - my masculine and feminie traits. I am more of the former than the latter. masculine trait - i have communication problems. feminine trait - i know why i have communications problems. i think it's an interesting subject matter: masculinity and femininity - why they exist and who or what determines it. I'd rather be both, actually i'd rather be neither. i don't need to be either. it's a false sense of self. the commercials - white european males - have always told us who we are, and which one of os is better than the other.   i've been thinking about my clothes. i'm not changing them per se, i'm just re-evaluation and recorordinating. getting more and more comfortable with myself. good. it's about time.  I had a talk with my mom this morning.  -  of course i almost always leave the phone feeling some kind of guilt . I haven't gotten another job yet mostly over pride and anger at myself. really, i don't want to work in retail unless it's something i really want to do. it's hard working in places like walmart because somehow i almost always get taken advantage of. i hate that i'm too nice sometimes. i have to get over it and just do it on monday. i have to stay on top of practicing. i have to. i don't want to talk about it any more.

      i've decided to try a personals add. i've done it before and met chat, and dorothy who just happen to be equally wonderful women. so lucky. i don't know, just seems like a logical way to try and meet some friends. people who are just as unique as i am. i want to get my picture up and going, but there's a little problem with that - technical problems with size and all that. but i'm actually excited about the prospects of being able to go out and have a little fun. but i keep thinking that i'm broke as hell and who knows when i'll be back on my feet - for real? or ever?   waiting from a reply from dorothy. i hope i don't sound nagging or anything like that, but she did kinda, or very straightforward ask me for advice. I wanted to help her, but I don't think I'm any better off than she is, or maybe i am, but i'm still too afraid to act on any of it.   today is a much better day from yesterday.  my friend robin is coming to take me out to lunch on tuesday on her way to the hilton head or whatever the hell it's called. it's been a while since i've seen any of my friends. since christmas, which in retrospect wasn't that far away, but it feels like forever to me. Hum, I guess it's been almost five months or so. grrrrrrrrhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

      i think i've decided to try and meet people but i don't think i know how. it seems like a simple process but not so much for me. it's scary becaues i never know what kind of mood i'll be in from moment to moment, and i'm afraid i'll be figured out as someone who is slightly unstable. although i think the word unstable is too strong of a word to descibe myself. i guess i can say i definitely have a circular personality. quite colorful, and who can complain about colors? overall, i have this slight anxiety of having to entertain, which I can do sometimes only if it feels completely natural like oil flowing off my skin. it's something i have to deal with. it's something i had to deal with yesterday. the realization of being lonely was so strong. it would have been nice to have someone to talk to, but that would defeat the purpose of being lonely. if i had someone to explain this to i wouldn't be lonely at all, would i?   i want to change my appearance. not into something that doesn't fit me. whatever i do it has to be comfortable. nothing outlandish or over the top. i went through my closet and there's not much in there. it'd be nice if i could do a little shopping, but that would require money, and i'd have to rob someone, so i'll have to hold off on that for a while and come up with a more legit way to get some cash. i think i figure out what i like and can still keep my integrity. all i need to start the new look are flip-flops? damned walmart.

      i just spoke to jennifer and there's another possibility for work. i know i should pursue everything so at least one of them will work out. it's in jackson tn, and I would be teaching students, and who know, maybe playing the symphony as well. the only draw back is that it's in jackson tn, but who the hell cares. it would be work and jennifer and i could possibly wdo this together which is an awesome thought since she and i do work very well together. i also work well with james. i guess i work well with everyone. plus the people in jackson tn would be willing to pay to have us suzuki certified which means we'll be teaching and growing as teachers at the same time. that's a great deal. one i could live with and would go very nicely on my resume. it could help me get a job somewhere. maybe even at a college if they have some sort of program working with kids or something like that. this is all very exciting and i'm looking forward to making so decisions about the fall. it all seems to be happening very fast. we'll see. like i said before, there are no bad decisions. it's all good.   t

      i spoke to my friend james last night, the one i miss teaching and having margaritas with, and he seems to be doing well, but he always does. although i don't think he's this way with me, he tends to hide his feelings. his brother died seemingly unexpectantly. i know that's got to be hard on him and his family. i don't think they were terribly close, but still... there was a time we weren't sure if sidon was dead or alive since we didn't know where he was and we hadn't heard from him in almost a complete year. we were all scared, but hopeful. he finally came around. the one thing i don't like about my family is that we do have way to much pride for our own good. no one wants to let anyone else see them down, which is funny because we should feel the most comfortable around our family members when facing adverse situations. i wish i didn't have so much pride. i'd have a second job by now. i'd be doing whatever it is i have to do instead of sulking about where i have to do it. i should really get over myself.

      I got a great email from a friend. someone who's facing some of the same issues I face about God and making the right decisions for my life while not putting too much weight on what other's think I should do. I love myself way too much to not be happy anymore. God sends comfirmations. I can love who I am, and I don't have to wait for him to "make" someone love me. Isn't that a  horrible way to live and love - waiting and waiting for all the wrong, selfish reasons?  Is that really love. It can be hard not to mistake a deep, sincere, friendship for partnership. It's time to give that up. I'm learning more and more about how to just accept myself and just be. Don't worry about two years down the road. Don't worry to much about next year. Everything will fall into place if I just continue to work and let it. I can't do everything at once. I need to be in school next year, and I need to be okay about it.

      from jennifer to me:   We both posses a great people-skill.  Not one that is useful in the workplace, not the kind that stands out in flashing lights. Because we aren't people persons.  But we see the character, the dimensions, the depth, the skews.  We see the thought processes and the growth and the tiny, subtlest cues that people give off subconsciously and consciously.  With that gift, we could make a great living as writers or psychologists. The good writers and therapists have the skill...and we, as patients or clients, or readers...well, sometimes it gets in the way MAJORLY. It is hard to be a mental patient when you have the skills those treating you either do or are supposed to.  On the other hand, we are mighty fine musicians, damnit, and they aren't. So there.  And, yes, let's set a date to blow up the music building.  First, we have to steal all the cool stuff out of it...wouldn't want it to just get wasted! Ah. Entertaining daydreams.  What I could do with the minidisk recorder that just sits in the office.  Be proud...I have not even opened the drawer or looked at it once.  Anyhow. I want you to know that your kind words really lifted me up today. And I don't think that your depression has turned into acceptance. I think that you are a very strong and powerful woman through your depression and, though it will return and then go and then return, you accept who you are. I really feel that these years we are having are existential crisis.  You and I seem to be having ours at the same time and that is what happened after blue lake.  We no longer had our comfortable surroundings and people (I did, but it was all different and so I really didn't) to define the path of our day to day lives and consequently our overall journey. I believe, I really do, that once we find what we are to be, we will be two of the most powerful women around. Maybe no one will know that, but the people who we influence will.

      i'm trying this again because i fucked up the first time and made it disappear.now i have to try and think about what i wrote. it was better the first time around believe me.   i'm disconnect. i have no friends. i have them, there somewhere. i have jennifer who is my life jacket even from seven hours away. i miss familiarity. i miss margaritas with james after teaching. i miss playing rachmaninoff with windell, and my lessons with michael. there's no place for me that's mine, except in my car while driving. no matter where i am, the atmosphere will be the same. i like that.   things are still okay at the new place. there's an 18 year old cat who likes to scream at the top of its lungs when she wants attention. it's a strange cat, but if i were 100 or so in human years i'd be a little eccentric too. i left her outside by mistake a couple of days ago with no food or water. i thought she'd ignore or hate me, but she's okay and actually more affectionate towards me. i like having her around. i really like the stray kitty who comes to the door everyday at least twice for food. when i leave i'd like to take her with me.  i don't know who lil jon is, and because of that i'm not connected to my people. these are not my words, and they weren't serious when they said it, but i don't think it's possible to be disconnected to my people. i know my peeps quite well, i mean, i'm one of em. i feel a sense of comfort when around my people and sometimes I take my subculture for granted or get wrapped up in my own elitist superego. i'm still connected.   as ofr other things though, i can't let myself be too open because i'm still not sure exactly where i stand, and i don't want to think about it right now. i can't be too concerned about those things.  still hanging on to vegetarianism - standing up to the corporate pigs for my own health and the protection of animals. humans are horrible.   having a hard time controling my moods. of course i want people to think i'm happy. i don't know why i want to cry right not, but i do. there's nothing wrong that hasn't been wrong for quite some time now,  but still - i'm no longer that upset about it even though i'm slightly stressed still. it'll be okay. i'll figure it out. was stoicism better? still, i'd like to think it's better to feel something than nothing at all.

      I'm a little upset at the moment - feeling like a complete loser, like a nobody. I know I've said this a gagillion times, and I'm actually sick of myself, but there's got to be something that I can do to make things different, to feel important and wanted. I can say that I love myself more, that's a good thing, but I also feel like 30 is gaining on me and I better do something quick before I get there and look back over my life and realize I still havent' done a  damn thing with it. I'm seriously afraid I'll be one of those old people who regret not doing the things they want to do. I can't really say I've done much of anything. About a week and a half to go before I turn 27. that gives me 3 years including this one to get it together. That's it. 3 years and counting. I'm honestly trying not to compare myself to those around me, but I can't help but think that for myself, and myself only, I should be doing something other than going to school all the damn time, never leaving, never trying, never getting anything done. I can't pay my bills. I have to practice all the time, but I can't do that if I have to work to pay the bills that are stacking up one after the other after the other after the other. It's annoying - and ..... heartbreaking....actually. I have to do something.

      it's amazing what one can do when there's just a little thought applied to the process. ten-key, people go to school for this sort of thing. it only took me a few minutes to learn the basics - where everything is.   haven't heard from a. in a long. slightly worried she might be avoiding me. maybe she hasn't and i'm a fool to think she is. of course it's all about me.   it's gay pride here in sc. i don't have any pride for anything. i don't feel anything. i am nothing, and i think i like it that way for now. there is nothing happening in my life where i need to make any decisions. i'm not hoping or wanting for anything or anyone, although sometimes i can get emotional - like any of us can.  last night i had a god moment watching joan of arc. she believed but she maybe, according to the movie believed what she wanted to believe in some cases. it's very easy to mystify religion and shift into some world only you and a few other living souls live in. it's sad. they look down on others who are not apart of their world.   there's a tiny fragment of a relationship with god dwelling somewhere in me. i don't trust myself to let it out completely since I was so broken and feel betrayed from it. i can't rush it. things will be fine. i'm still here. i'm, not going anywhere - i just hiding from the public yey.

      i've decided to apply for a teaching job in nashville, at least for starters. i feel comfortable working there mostly because i know people who live there. important people. okay, maybe not important, but at least i like them. i really can't see myself working at walmart at this point in my life with a masters degree and maybe other things going for me. i have to admit i'm a little afraid of the application process. i just don't really feel qualified. well, i feel qualified, i don't think they'll think i'm qualified because i'm not certified to teach in a school, although i've done a little of that, and it has to have not been for no reason at all. surely i was given that opportunity for a purpose.

      ...despite. I got a call from Walmart. not too terribly excited about it. not at first at least. thinking about money, the fact that i need it, and then there's the thought " this is a temporary thing." if i were to work there that would be the sustaining sentence that will keep me going. i'll possibly be less sstressed out about things - money mainly. I can maybe get out of credit card debt, and the other debts I'm in. there's another interview tomorrow before the walmart one. supposedly, according to the add in the newspaper, it pays well, though 'm only working an additional 19 hours per week. i'm not interested in killing myself for the cause. although, the killing wouldn't happen before i'm done, which is i don't know when. don't know about the moving thing still, with the school having fucked me over. fucked me over. fucked me over. I don't really kow what to do about that, except I should just charge over to one of those offices and see what's up. if there's anything they can do to make things a little more tolerable for me. i hate to have this problem. it sucks, but you know, still living in euphoria.  in the last couple of days i've about eaten 8 candybars, two huge pieces of icecream cake, two cupcakes, and there's still a hole burning in my chest.

      2004-05-05 14:48:00;  okay, so she's taken. married to be exact. i hate we had that conversation, because now i feel a little weird being around her, like she thinks i'm stalking her. i COULD be in certain circumstances, but god no!!!   school is finally over, the jury is done. it went okay. i lost the pianist halfway through, but i don't care very much for juries - people who know nothing about my playing can't decide what i've learned or if i've learned anything at all from one performance which may or may not be good depending on what kind of day i'm having. so, i just don't care what they think - at all.   i've put out applications. today one went to walmart. i just don't care anymore, except maybe a little, but the little is turning into definitely anywhere i can make a buck is fine by me. the summer feels like it's going fast and it's just begun. just begun. just begun.   i'm still living off the whole "last week" experience - aside from being cranky due to constant hunger. i decided it's okay to steal things like food if you absolutely have no money. i can really see how poor people are driven to crime. it could be addictive if you let it. i mean, one day you're stealing food so you can eat, and then you think up all these other things you need, and of course, there's only one way to get it. TAKE IT.   in case i stick around here in the fall, i'm planning my recitals which is a little harder that i initially thought it would be. i'd like to play some unaccompanied pieces, but the Bach pieces i'd like to commit to are already taken. thinnking of continuing my lessons with bob is a frustrating thought. i think i'd have to be a little more assertive pertaining to what i want - i think that's become important at this point in my learning. i have to actively pursue some financial plan since the school has officially fucked me over - the capitalist bastard assholes.   anyway, i don't want to feel awkward around her. i'd just like to be friends and not worry about other stuff. i mean, i just don't really know what to say or do - how to act really - yeah be myself, but still. i'm a little frustrated with the ways things have gone since then.

      2004-05-03 12:47:00;  i've moved into the new house. i'm really comfortable there so far. there's a cat. i've gotten used to the idea of having one around. it's something i need, but glad i'm not solely responsible for. things are looking better. i'm thinking better - handling things better than I ever have before. there are still many things I need to do to get myself on track. still looking for that second job. trying not worry too far aheasd of myself.   i juries in about an hour. i'm a little nervous about it, but i'm reminding myself that it doean't carry that much weight - at least not for me. I can't wait for school to be over. i really need the summer.

      lately i've been doing some thinking about myself and god and the bible. just in the last few months i've changed so much about the way that i think about things. i wish i could talk to my ex-roommate tricia about all of my new findings. i like the idea of not going to church, at least for now. i still be in jesus - i don't think that'll ever change, but i'm not so sure i believe as heavily in the bible as i used to. i'm not even so sure it was divinely inspired. it says in the 1tim 3:16 that the scriptures are divinely inspired - not the letters that paul wrote to his buddies. surely these are not scriptures to be analysed and molled over for centuries as we seem to think. anyway, i just do seem to see where many of those thoughts fit into my culture - the culture of today. god is the same yesterday today and forever, but who really knows what that means? it dosn't imply that he's old fashion. i don't think he should. i do think it means we can always count on him/her in the same way we have for ages, and for ages more to come. it doean't meant that he/she can't change.   speaking of changing. i wonder about relationships with people, especially those of us who are single. it all of a sudden becomes different when you're married.  you have to find new people to hang out with becuase there's this other person you've committed your life to. i mean, the single person gets left out. it's kind of sad in a way. basically, if i could just have a sex partner, i'd be happy with that for a while. other than that, i don't think i want to be beholded to one person. not if it means not communicating with other people, becuase i don't know, it just doesn't seem to be fair that someone would want so much of me that i can't have any kind of like outside of that person. if i were to be in a relationship, i want it to not fit the mold that every one else seems to fall into. i want a separate life - one of my own.   it'll be interesting to see how my and jennifer's relationship changes as we move into other areas of our lives after having move away from each other.   anyway, i think a part of me wants to be  in a loving relationship - and i actually feel as though i can make that happen, but the other part of me feels like i can't be in one, because technically i never have been, and i don't know that i'd know what to do. i've changed a lot over the past few weeks and months.  hmmmmmmmm

      i got a phone call from NPS today but of course I didn't pick up the phone. Note to self. PICK UP THE DAMNED PHONE. who knows? they may want me to come in for an interview. otherwise-why would they bother call me? i've decided though, that I have to go to chicago. i just have to. it's good to have options though. maybe i could also apply to get a job in chicago. that would be the most awesome-ist thing ever!

      i'm looking on the internet to find apartments or a place to stay or whatever in chicago fo august. it's an exciting process. i'm having a lot of fun looking at the pictures and letting my imagination run wild. what it look like if i were living in this space? what does the neighborhood looklike. as of right now, i'm looking in the area of town where i might be taking cello lessons and or practicing. that would be wonderful. i like thinking and planning. so much fun.    i'm still trying (being the operative word) to stay positive about the whole thing.

      i had a little freak out moment last night after i got an email from amy. she's so sweet, but i'm araid i don't know how to take her. i think with all the negativity i have inside of me looming to get out, i'm try very hard to rid myself of it, i don't think i'm readily able to recognize her kindness, when i so deperately want to know of it and feel it at a moment's notice. she is such and awesome girl. i told her in an email that i am blessed many times over to have her as my friend. i love that girl!!!  anyway, i thought she was being a little finicky, when it is i who is being lightfooted as jennifer put it. i talked to mimi last night and she helped me see things in a more positive light - no pun intended. i called and let her know for sure, without any shadows or doubts that i am coming. i've decided to just calm down and put my faith in god that i'm doing the right thing and that all will work out the way they should.   i've decided to look for an apartment that has a free month's rent. i don't know why i hadn't thought of that before, but there are a few places i'm interested in that offer a free month's rent. that'll give me time to find a job somewhere, hopefully without reservations or giving place to my ego, and be able to make rent thereafter.   i told amy not to stress herself out over anything. it will all be fine. i know it will. i love her. i do. i'm so glad she's my friend. i'm extremely lucy to have the likes of her, kevin, robin, becky, and jennifer in my life. i don't know what i'd do without them.

      i'm finding that it's very hard to stay focus, or to do all the things we say we'll do and not watch them fall by the wayside. i'm very happy i'm haning in there with the things i've been commited to. i've got the letters to sc and tn state reps. sealed, stamped and ready to be sent. i'm excited about that, about taking a stand for my right to marry whomever i want as long as i'm doing it for the right reasons. i don't think it's wise to take away people's choices. it just doesn't seem right - even if i had religious convictions about it. it just doesn't seem right to take away a choice to do something, especially one that does not hurt other people or self. so, i'm looking for more ways to get and stay involved. it's a beautiful thing.

      To use the Constitution to discriminate against any group of people is shameful. It is neither compassionate nor conservative. It is a radical position that would insert discrimination into the document that has guaranteed and expanded liberty and equality for over 200 years.     The U.S. Constitution should not be amended to limit the rights of a group of people.  Further, the power to regulate marriage and the granting of civil marriage licenses is a power that has historically been reserved to the states. A constitutional amendment to prohibit governmental recognition of same-sex relationships would take this power away from states.    The amendment would do much more than define marriage. Leading legal scholars agree that the amendment could forever invalidate civil unions or other legal protections for same-sex couples -- such as the right to visit a partner in the hospital or to receive partner health benefits -- even if state legislatures passed them and voters approved them.     The rights and responsibilities of marriage, other forms of relationship recognition like domestic partnerships and civil unions, and basic civil rights protections are essential components that make all families, including families headed by same-sex couples, safer and more secure.  Marriage licenses, which are granted by the state, and religious marriage, are two separate things. Religious institutions will never be forced to bless relationships with which they disagree, just as today religious institutions can refuse to marry couples of different faiths or individuals who have been divorced.     Please oppose any attempt to build discrimination into the very document that should protect everyone and please oppose any other legislation designed to prohibit civil, secular recognition of same-sex relationships.  I look forward to hearing from you on this extremely important issue.

      i went to the internet cello society today and engaged in forums and chat for the first time. i was always too scared to get involved,  but now that i'm a little older and a little cello wiser, i think i fit in more than i thought i would. plus everyone seems to be very nice and i liked having conversations with people who have the same interests as i do. i'm very excited about that. it's just a fun place to hang out for a while. i think'll go back there again tomorrow.

      spoke to amy last night. she's looking into a place for me to stay. it'd be really great if we could just move in together. i'd be happy with that, and i get the feeling she will be also. i can't believe i'm actually going through with this. i'm extremely excited and happy.   last night I was thinking about all the times i've tried to do all the right things to set my course straight, to feel and be happy. really, all it takes is a decision, and to just keep deciding over and over again until it becomes a part of my being. i'm so much more close than i thought i was. i just have to accept the person inside of me trying to get out. that's all. i'm free.

      i woke up today in pretty good spirits. i know everyday won't be this astounding vacuum of happiness i seem to be floating around in for no apparent reason other than the fact that that's where i decided to dwell.   even with someone else's good news, which can be depressing to other females, i seem to be doing fine, and am still happy for my friends. that's the attitude i've chosen for myself. i'm hanging in there, and that's a good thing.   practicing is so much less annoying now. maybe because i'm setting little goals for myself, and really, i don't ever want to quit, so i just have to find a way to keep going and make the cello my friend - not the annoying kind that won't go the fuck away, but one i want to stick around and keep me company for years to come - until one of us dies.   i'm really excited about the next few months, as if the chicago thing might happen. i'm hoping it will while trying to be realistic. got a phone call from amy. i'm eager to here what she has to say. i hope it's favorable. i told her i wanted to be close to her, so i'm hoping she understands that. she says she feels we're meant to be together whatever that means. if nothing more than a very close friendship and work comes out of it, then i'd be really happy with that.

      when you start to thinkn something new, like changing your life, things come along immediately and start to challenge those changes. today there are things challenging the wonderful day i've had. i'm excited i can talk to myself and remind myself of the wonderful things i've decided to live and be. i'm excited to have these challenges because it only lets me know i'm on the right track to being who and what i want to be. i'm ready and accept these challenges with open arms and heart. i'm ready to move and move and move and move.

      i've decided to start back practicing five hours a day. each day i am to tentatively decides when to start. i think i'm practicing much better these days. i just have to keep deciding and going after what it is i want to do. the popper idea is a good one. turn some of the etudes into songs tamar-style. i'm kind of excited   i have to admit. i'm a little jealous of jennifer getting married. not of her relationship, but i'm a good person, and i've waited and waited. sometimes i wonder if i'm just meant to be alone, but that would be the old tamar thinking and not loving herself because somehow i've come to believe that i'm not good enough to be loved by anyone, and that just isn't true. if anything, there is no one out there is who really good enough for me. maybe that's not true either,but i do know i'm a wonderful person who loves hard and deserves that same kind of love in return. i do.

      learned about a new religion today called kaballah. it's a religoin that's not a religion. somewhat close to judaism from what i can gather. i find it intersting though that so many of us are looking for the way. we think we need mysticism. i had it for a very long time - even through chrisitanity. many of the kaballist seem to look for mysticism and not religoin - seemingly christianity is not mystic only rules. i found the rules in my own beliefs, but i do know there are things that cannot be explained, i can never explain them. i lived in my own world for a very long time. it's a very lonely place, mysticism. it's hard to associate with other people, because no one else believes in the same depth. very few people have the "enlightenment" and understanding. i do know, that i am not ready to go back to such places. i would go in and never come back out.   i did learn one thing though, or agreed on one thing. i don't believe the bible is taught in the way jesus intended. i don't believe christianity is taught the way jesus intended. i do know that many of us are upset with the churches and the people who call themselves christians. i'm not perfect by any stretch of the word, and i don't use that as a scapegoat, but i wish we'd all acknowledge that we don't know anything, and stop judging people. i no longer believe in one interpretation of the bible. not anymore. universily, we are to love one another and have patience and understanding. that's all.  tamar

      wow!!! my best friend, jennifer, got married this afternoon, or yesterday afternoon. I'm really excited for her and happy they finally went through with it!!  i've been happy all day. possibly because it's finally nice outside, but mostly because i just decided to practice like i normally practice, that i sound ok, that things are just going to go well because i expect them to, and dammit they just will. so. there it is. here i am, and i'm ready to move. yay!!

      one of my biggest faults is that i expect to know everything. there's a feeling that accompanies all decisions or choices that lets me know whether i'm doing the right thing or not. i haven't gotten that in a very long time, and so now i know nothing besides the confusion that stays settled in my bowles. i'm frustrated, because i can't see and no one can tell me. i know i am not able to wait any longer, because i've been waiting the last few years for a sign of some sort.   i will go to chicago and i will be stranded. i will stay here, and i will continue to sit in the middle of the path knowing full well that all the cars will just go around me. that isn't a true risk. this gut feeling keeps me safe and still when i need to be unsure and moving. i don't want anyone's religious truth clouding my perception, nor do i want my hapless love to serve as a hindrance. perhaps i need to go where there is no influence at all - where i know no one. perhaps i shall stick to my second plan, but the original is where she is, and that's where i truly want to be. i would be a fool to go through with it? i would be a fool to stay here. getting my head together is hard - making sure all my intensions are honorable so i don't get spat out in the end.

      isn't ready to move to sc right now. she suggested i move to chicago in the mean time. i don't know what's wrong with me. i really want to but i'm afraid. i don't want to go there and fall in love with her and have my feeling crushed. i want us to just be plutonic, which we will be, but i don't want to have expectations of something that won't happen at all. i have to honestly be prepared for the something that defintely won't happen. i understand her and i understand our friendship. why can't i just be spontaneous and just do it. i'm getting more hours, a little more, at work, and can just take advantage of that and just move there. i can do that with no hesitations if i know we'll do the san diego thing, and you know, what if we don't do it, then i have to be prepared to do whatever it is i have to do when i feel like i need to do it. the whole point of going to chicago was to be near her, because i feel like i need that. maybe i don't but i feel like we need to work together or something. the whole point of moving to san diego was to be near her, because before then i hadn't thought specifically about san diego. so why not just go for it and make it happen when i have the time and the energy to do it. so just do it. so just do it. i can do it and it'll be great and we won't have any regrets whatsoever.  tamar

      these all seem to be about amy these days. she tried to call me last night to "chat." I'm wondering what she'll say to my request.  my mother is giving me info on getting a job in all these places I don't want to be. i don't think she gets the point. i need to live= i haven't been living. grrrrrrr.

      i tried to call amy last night and invite her to move with me to san diego in august - couldn't get ahold of her so i left a message on her voicemail. the conversation i had with chat is still with me. august seems so soon, but it also seems perfect. my heart flutters when i think of the prospect of moving. it makes me happy and nervous, but really, all of these feelings are wonderful and exciting. i have so much to look forward to, and so much do before it happens. i can see it being a very beautiful butterfly-like transformation. it will be my greatest adventure. and why wait till next year when all signs point to go in blinking neon tamar lights.   why not. why not.

      went to see rasputina last night at new brookland tavern. had a great time. found a new band to admire, Faun Fables. the other band was just okay. i tried to call amy yesterday, but sh'e not to be reached. hopefully i'll get a chance to talk to her tonight. i left her a message explaining i'd call tonight. i'm going to ask her to come with e to san diego in august insetead of next year. if it's something that needs to happen then what the hell are we waiting for? anyway - it's not some romatic triumphant thing. i figure we'd write music together and do stuff. or i'd just do my thing and she hers, but i'm going with ot without her, and that's that. my mom keeps trying to help me and she's not really helping me. the jobs in the small towns that have nothing for me. i'm a performer - i should just find a place where i can live and work and be able to perform.   change my attitude before i' leave shcat says. i'm willing to do that. i'm willing to work on that. i'll go back and find the list and also go back and fine the letter. the good one. i'll read them and read them and read them and say things and learn to believe and have the kind of faith i used to have when i was smaller. younger. when i really believed.

      had a conversation with her this morning. i'm so glad she's such a part of my life. sometimes you just know when god sends you someone, and i know without a doubt that she's one of the people god sent to me. i'm not sure if i add anything to her life, i sure i do, but i'm glad i can be doing most of the getting. basically she's telling me I can't be afraid anymore. i have to make my life happen. going to san diego is a go idea, but only if i'm doingit for the right reasons. i don't want to go because amy wants me to, she's too scared to go by herself, or i'm too scared to go by myself. it's for me - to get something out of it that's going to change my life in a drastic but meaningful and powerful way. i can't put these thoughts into words, it's hard for me to do that. i have to talk to amy. i need to talk to her. i think whatever i do, i'm just going to have to go, and if she wants to come, then fine.

      i just saw the movie kissing jessica stein. maybe i needed to, but i'm trying to think less like that. everything doesn't have to be some divine mystical huge deal, but i enjoyed the movie with lynn, one of the women in our group - the leader per se. it was just she and i, and i wasn't sure if i wanted to say yes, lets watch, or no we'll take a rain check since no one else showed. i said we should watch the movie, and i was trying not to be uncomfortable, and i was wondering the whole time if she was, or if i was being entertaining enough. i had to make comments here and there - not for her, but for me. it's like i'm trying to be communacative, but i'm not really saying anything worth saying, or i'm laughing a little too hard. i'm glad i had a chance to watch it though. there are some discussion points. challenging sexuality and the constructs we've been handed - tearing them down and creating our own constructs. that's where i am right now. i'm more comfortble with being who and what i am, i just - not so much trying to come up with a definition - trying to figure out what's comfortable to me.   i said i wouldn't talk about love or any of those things, because i don't want to be one of those stupid people who can't live unless they're dating, but i do have to acknowledge that it's a part of all of our lives. it's a part of my life even though i've never experienced a "relationship." so, in saying all this, i have to realize that amy and i moving in together is not about romance. it's about our friendship and where we are in our lives. we understand each other - "get" each other, and that's something to be said. maybe we'll move there and she'll meet someone. so, i just don't want to think or expect anything other than what i have already.

      i'm having back pain. noticable this weekend, but definitely today. seems to have gotten worse since yesterday's practice. it bothers me that i'm having such trouble getting it together. all the stupid shit that seems to be getting in the way or taking forever. dammit!!!!! for the final time, all the stuff is being sent off tomorrow no questions asked. it will all be finished tonight. no matter what. fucking dammit!!!!!  i have this idea to turn some of the popper etudes to songs. thing is, i have trouble finishing anything i start. i'm extremely frunstrated. i think i'd have a since of urgency if i knew what the hell it is i need to do. that would get me going, but there's nothing, and i'm very sure i won't be leaving. that's fine, but since i'm against that thought i'm not doing much to stay. get an apartment, find more money for school so i don't have to take it all out on loan. i think this year will be much better that last year, though, and having even the smalles inkling of a goal seems to be helping just a little.  i'm so lathargic. i'm so lathargic. i'm so lathargic. i'm so lathargic.

      I feel so much better now that I've sent at least two of my recommendations to where they need to go. I'm hoping everthing will be in withing a week and a half. That would be more than awesome. I also need to get in gear if I'm planning on sticking around this year for school. I have to put things in place...apply for financial aid, figure out why the school wants all my money, figure out how to get an assistantship. Needing a loan to stay here would be not a good thing by any stretch of the word. I'm getting more excited about plans now. They seem to be a little more tangible. Things I can actually do.

      got an email from amy today inviting me to move with her to san diego in a year. she could continue her schooling there, and I guess i could get a job somewhere. she's really funny. i love her, though. if she was really serious about that i'd do it! she said she's ready to make a move and take some risks, and i really feel like i'm ready to do the same thing. i've felt it be great to do that with someone so i don't have to feel alone - we'd both have some emotional support, which is important when making a big transition like that. anyway, i can't think of a better roommate. i think we'd be good for each other.

      I started a new song project last night. it's exciting!!! i have some good ideas to explore and am willing to spend more time on them. i'm trying to be a little more patient.   got a phone call from my mum yesterday. interesting, i already knew most of what she'd say. it's as if she calls and i get a pre-recorded message - the same one each time. it'd be glad to have something to say to her besides my own pre-recorded message, "there's nothing new going on." if i have to say that again...  i heard back from dorothy. i was concerned i may have said something wrong - i can be very shrewd at times. i really wanted to give my thoughts to her as honestly as i can - let her know i am not as strong as i let on. i'm faultered, i'm weak and i need as much help as i can get even though i have so much pride - i can't ask. i'm working on it.   yesterday i had a god moment - all these fears circling me, but i'm getting a little better at casting them aside. what to do what to do, my constant thought is my fear of giving in, up or out. what if i just stop everything and go down a totally unexpected path. a place where no one in the world would expect me to go. there'll always be something. maybe i can go where no one will find me an impose their thoughts on me - audible or inaudible. i wish i could just disappear.  i'm still waiting for the coffee to kick in.

      last night i caved and ate a hamburger. today i'm back in full force, craving another though. i'm fighting the hole in my chest and am tempted to fill it will all kinds of smokey goodness - cigarettes et al. i know it's not good for me, but i'll only live once so why not experiment and test the limitations of my body. who's gonna know...maybe the morgue. i haven't made any new friends via the internet and i'm thinking what the hell, who cares anyway? i'm staring down at my big fat thighs - i know i can't have a hamburger now, besides, there's all that talk about the united states' poor inspection of the meats we consume on a daily basis. last night was a weak moment and burger king was just across the street. i'll have to find a way to fight it off - be passionate. wouldn't it be cool to write a requiem for myself? it's hard to do that since i'm not so sure if i'm dead or not - the things i wish were dead. they all need to die unless, of course, i change my mind. tonight, i will have a bean sandwhich - i really need the protein - that's why the meat failure - i'm lacking essential vitamins and my only excuse for not taking them is that i don't want to have orage pee. silly i know, but it all ready is since i frequently choose coffee over water. need to stop that.

      I'm really concerned about my diet. When I think I'm doing the right thing, I figure out that I'm bloated and fat, again. I know the yoga is helping, because I notice subtle differences in my body that when I look in the mirror make me feel really good about myself, but I have to remind myself that I'm on this quest for a reason, and I need to stick to it, and coninue to modify it until I find what really works for me. I spent the greater bulk of last week eating veggie burgers for meals, and I had one yesterday. One way too many I think. I need to stop and try to get much more fruit and vegetables into my diet. I went grocery shopping yesterday, and decided, as I did before but wasn't ready for it, that I don't want to consume bread - or at least very little - or dairy products. I could focus on clothing wear more, but I'm not going that far right now. I want to get comfortable with this new idea of healthy eating and taking care of myself.&nbsp; I've been doing well for the most part. I just need to keep motivating myself, and of course, cave every now and then and have a snack that's not so healthy. I've decided that I'm not eating McDonald's fries, or fries from any of those establishmenst, because they do contain meat and while I'm not opposed to killing animals for food, I am opposed to the way we treat them, which has changed drastically over the years as machines&nbsp;replace human affection. I'd like to spend some time cooking more and discoving dishes that will be tasty. Yeah!!!!! I need to find a way to replace the cream in my coffee with non dairy creamer. That's a good start and possibly the final installment to being pescaterian.

      today, i went to the library, public, and checked out a couple of books on the kabbalah, zohar. i am excited about learning and reading with an open heart, of course, slightly guarded. i have a new curiosity that i feel ready to ecplore and see what happens, where i land. it seems, though, there are things leading up to this moment. there was the "Madonna" article, and then there was this computer research, leading to newspapers and and a biography on Einstein, Amy, and now an actual book on the topic. of course, I&nbsp;am bent on finding my own ideas about god, but i'm justing being open to other ideas, because for the&nbsp;first time in my life, i feel ready to recieve them. &nbsp;however, thoughout all of this, i am focussed on remainting grounded, because that is the wisdom of the universe.

      This is a post from someone who calls himself Tristan. He doesn't post often, but i read his blog once, and I have to go back from time to time to see what he's written. I think he's really interesting. This is my favorite of the few blogs he's posted. these are the exact things i think. it's nice to know someone else share's my enthusiasm. I doubt he'll ever see this, but in case, i apologize for copying your thoughts to my blog - but this one really is a keeper.     urlLink Reich der Weltennacht   Saturday, July 17, 2004     Random rantings  I have been thinking about something that's been in my mind for the last days. The fact that the same situation affects different people differently. How everything is coloured by our perception of it. They say that a genius is the person that suffers the most&nbsp; when difficult situations arise. I can identify with that. Not that I am a genius or anything, far from it, but I think that it is only when your ability to empathize grows and become an overwhelming part of your spirit that life in this world becomes almost unbearable.It's like Wagner correctly pointed out in Parsifal "Durch Mitleid wissend"... compassion. The ability to feel what others feel, especially pain (that's why in German it is Mitleid..Leid=Suffering Mit=fellow... fellow-suffering). How can someone vouch for the existence of God in a world that is so full of pain, where your position in society depends on things that are absolutely out of your hands like looks or intelligence or even money. How can there be a world so full of injustice where people have a disease that consists of people not wanting to eat to stay thin (anorexia) when there's so many people in this world with nothing to eat. They can't afford to be anorexic, if they find food they eat it because they don't know when they'll have the chance again.Mankind has progressed so much in terms of providing people with luxury items that were reserved for loyalty in the past (for example as recently as 500 years ago, washrooms could only be found in a king's castle) yet there is something else that we lack as a people. We have to create problems where there's none. Young people everywhere that can afford anything they want to get now have to fit in society and so they have to be "bad guys" and prove that they are the "real deal". No one is interested in art, music, history anymore. Everybody is just thinking about having a good time and partying as hard as they can. For some reason I see no fulfillment in that and that's why I don't partake in it but a lot of people do.People&nbsp;think that we are here to have a good time and to party it up. After all we are only going to be here for 80 years or so (if we are lucky) so we are better off enjoying it. I agree with it but life is much more than that. It is about love and living life to the full by expressing one's emotions. The love to our parents, the love we have for our romantic partner, our relatives, etc. I am not a religious person (although I don't know if I would consider myself an atheist) but I sincerely think that if we were to follow the precepts laid out by that brilliant rebel that lived in the first century AD we would all be better off. It is very simple, Love yourself and&nbsp;love your neighbour. Respect people, animals and things because they all have a purpose on earth. Ignore race, colour, religion, etc. because those are things that DIVIDE us whereas we should be looking for things that UNITE us.Unfortunately the teaching of that great rebel are most of the time ignored and the things that are the very opposite to his teachings are carried out in his name. Who wants to follow a rebel's teachings if I can get my way by using HIM for my purposes&nbsp;by tainting his name? Who would want to do what that rebel taught us? Who would want to follow Jesus of Nazareth's teachings?I, despite not being a member of any religion (especially Roman Catholic), do.  posted by Tristan @  9:19 PM  &nbsp;  0 comments

      i don't know if it's the coffee, but i'm getting less and less sleep in the middle of the night, which makes me feel lazy when i wake up in the late morning ours. there really isn't much that i can do at that time in the morning, except dream away, which can be dangerous.   i did get some good practice in today, which is always welcomed and encouraging. i'm excited, excited, excited, about life and everything else. i feel great!! i talked to my mom last night. I have a little afraid to tell her my plans for chicago, but she made it easy for me. i wasn't going to bring it up at all. we've talked about it, but i know she disapproves not of me going, but that i'm not going with pocket loads of cash. i'm trying not to be too excited, and watch out for things will attempt to drag me down into some hold i can't get out of. i mustn't let that happen.   i'm more and more interested in the kabbalah. i haven't done much more reading on the topic, becuase i'm still very cautious, but i don't know, it seems kind of cool and trendy, and me, i'm not into those things,&nbsp;but neither am i&nbsp;out. i keep reminding myself to find god on my own terms and not look for some else to give me guidance.&nbsp; one other thing i'm starting to notice lately is my little fixation with horoscopes and the weekly conscious tune-ups from Yehuda Berg. Okay, it could kust be me because these things are almost always broad as far as information goes, but some of these things are right, and i can see how people can get addicted to looking at them and trying to live them out in some way. i don't know, it might be kind of dangerous so i'd better watch out. who is this human trying to tell me what to do or how to think? Yehuda Berg, though, the things he discusses seem to be on a much deeper spiritual level than horoscopes. It's really informative and interesting information such as this:   &nbsp;  Weekly Consciousness Tune-UpJuly 25th ・July 31st, 2004    Can You Handle the Truth?I mentioned last week that we were entering the three most negative weeks of the year. Last Sunday we entered into the most challenging 9 days of these three weeks, and with the most negative day approaching this Tuesday, July 27th, starting Monday night, July 26th, things are getting more intense. After Tueday, everything will lighten up. The question is, what can you do about it? Sitting around isn稚 the answer ・there痴 always a benefit to difficult times ・so what can you do? What痴 your opportunity? This week痴 energy is very powerful, and there are a few things to note.My teacher and father Kabbalist Rav Berg explains that these 7 days you need to remember what you learned when you first started Kabbalah: there is a force existing in the universe called Satan, a negative force that exists and surrounds you no matter how spiritual you might be. It痴 there, it痴 in you, and you have to be aware of it. Its greatest ploy is to make you forget it exists.No matter how good your intentions, or how spiritual you are, Satan is there. And Satan plays an important role. Remember, it痴 why you池e here ・so that you can use your free will and make choices in your life.This force is at its peak power these nine days, so it痴 necessary to have clarity as to what you need to transform in you in order to protect yourself.Here is an exercise that you can do ・write down on a piece of paper, the sentences:1. This is what I appreciate about you. 2. This is what you might want to change. Leave spaces for answers. Then give it to a friend and ask them to fill it out! Pick a good friend, one who has no agenda other than love for you. The amazing thing you will realize is that both the good and the bad traits relate to the same issue. For example, if someone writes that you are a good leader, a great teacher, and know how to show others direction, what could be the negative aspect of that? It most likely will be ego, and a need for control. The core essence of your being is one thing. Good and bad are two sides of the same coin.The energy of this whole month is about converting negativity into positivity. It痴 about converting bad to good. For example, a person born under the sign of Cancer is beautifully sensitive; it痴 an aspect of Light in them. But the Satan turns it into something bad, such as hypersensitivity.There has to be this Satan force, though. And you should never underestimate its power.The moment you understand that your essence is good and it is the Satan force that weakens it , you can take the good back from the bad. How do you do that this week? There are three ways: 1) Take all that痴 bad about you and bring it back to an embryonic state when it was only good! Let痴 say you池e jealous. What would jealousy be at an embryonic state? It would appear simply as a big desire ・wanting to have it all. And that痴 good! But Satan changes it into not wanting to have to work for it ・just wanting it now and not wanting anyone else to have it. This week, take all your negativity and bring it back to an embryonic state to see the positive in it.2) Don稚 react to anything negative, no matter what goes wrong! Don稚 deal with it! Be an ostrich and stick your head in the sand ・let the Light take over! The Zohar promises that if you don稚 react, the Light will take care of everything. If the bank calls and says you池e missing $10,000 dollars ・don稚 do anything. Surrender, trust the Light, and everything will be fine. 3) Become a witness to your own actions. The Zohar says this is a profoundly simple tool to convert negative to positive. Have an 登ut-of-body・experience; take yourself out of any situation you池e in and look at your behavior. Imagine a friend behaving like you and ask yourself if you would put up with them. Most of the time, if you see your own behavior, you値l find other things you want to change.It痴 painful to see your garbage. But this physical process is necessary for your spiritual one. People get more confused as they get more spiritual. It痴 because the more you do, the more that comes up. After 20 years of working on yourself, you can get tired ・it痴 hard. It痴 hard because when you first start working on yourself, you deal only with big stuff. The further down the spiritual path you go the deeper you get into the details.When you start your first Kabbalah class and you want to correct yourself, the only answer you get is to restrict. Very broad, very easy. Then in Kabbalah II, you hear you have to restrict your ego. Then in your third class, as you learn more, you hear that you have to restrict your ego in a specific way. The more you learn the more specific the work gets. You are continually refocusing.The whole idea is to realize that the more you study and do, the more direction your restriction has. Yet the more you have details, the more you know you are progressing!Do this week痴 exercises with excitement. Know that each uncomfortable truth you face creates a bigger opening for the things you are searching for to enter your life.   All the Best,Yehuda Berg   72 Name   &nbsp;   now, doesn't that make you think about things in a really interesting sort of way? i've thought about my life in a much more positive way. mostly because i want to, and there really is no other way to live.   anyway, that's my rant for now.

      talk about needing to control myself. I had a conversation with amy yesterday, and i've thought about nothing else but her ever since. we're both excited and anxious about my move in a few weeks. We decided that Aug. 14 is the day i'll arrive there. she'll be done with her finals by then. my heart is pounding with anticipation. i have to push away any expectations on my part and just allow our friendship to flourish naturally into what ever beautiful thing it'll turn into. this fall will bring with it big things for the both of us. she's scared, and i'm scared, but i'm positive and hopeful for the both of us. i can see that we really need each other right now. i pray that i will not be selfish, but true to her and myself. i don't want to be thinking solely about myself, but her as well; our friendship and what's best for the us both in regards to that. i pray that god will keep me, and her, and bring us both the peace and happiness we both search for through him/her.   anyway, i have felt my happiness for a long time, and it doesn't come from any outside forces. that is to say, that amy does not MAKE me happy, nor does Wellbutrin ( haven't taken it for two months) and nor does leaving this place. i believe that.&nbsp; anything from here on out is an addition to the happpiness and peace i am learning to enjoy. i wonder though, we all have flaws and need to work on them continually: I wonder how to go about working on yourself without feeling depressed about needing to work all the time, without end. I guess the key is to realize that we all have flaws, and it's a blessing i can see them or have them gently pointed out, and work on them. that's a positive way to see things.

      in regards to the last few posts about depression, i really do feel much better these days. must be womanhood. who knows what triggors these things, although i think chat may have a bit to do with it. ever since our last conversation i've been feeling how she felt at that time. no wonder no one wants to hang around a sour puss. it's contagious. i picked up a book of poetry by charles bukowski. it didn't have the same affect this time as the last several times. it's not as if i was ever a true fan of his, but i liked the simplicity of his works. now i read them and see them as they are. ramblings of an old tired man who'se stilled depressed about his depressed youth. it's sad, yet i still hold a sort of fascination for his raw honesty. i can appreciate it for what it is.   anyway, thoughout all this nervous energy, i still feel good about everything. i pray i'll get things together, and that amy will still have me at her place since that seems to be one of my few choices these days. still, it's a choice, and really, i prefer it.

      i feel as though i should be out of the house, and here, i have made my way to the music building hoping to get some work done, but feeling completely uninspired. again, i am thinking there is nothing in particular that keeps me going. desires that make me want to work hard enough for soemthing i feel passionately about. can write about this a hundred times and it'll still be here. you know what my real focus is now. i don't have to tell you again. i have to make phone calls today, or they'll never get made, i will spend most of my time on this as it is the only thing i feel i can do - add to the cause. so, i am off. off again.

      there's a young, stray cat that comes around the house where i live. my roommate named it "squeaky" which totally fits the timbre of its young meow. now i know why people live with pets. i forgot how incredibly healing animals are. they do take up where people leave off. there's a cat who lives in the house&nbsp;with us &nbsp;named "whiskers" who's much older, but still needs the same amount of attention. she likes her fair share of head rubbing. in the middle of the night when the house is asleep, she selfishly screams outside of my door waiting for me to jump up and pet her head. of course, i roll over and ignore her. she's got to learn somehow that there's a time when i'm not to be disturbed. however, this morning she laid on the bed with me while i read my book, and it was a marvelous time. she's only done that once before. it was nice to have some other living, breathing body on the bed looking at me in total want of affection. this time i appeased her, because it appeased me, too. as for squeaky, as soon as she sees my car pulling into the driveway, she awakes from the top of my roommates jeep car and greets me with a series of scrappy meows - sometimes for affection, mostly for food. i noticed this week how much that affects me. i'm happy when i see her - giving her food and light taps on the head. i think i realized in the past few weeks, that there's so many ways to be affectionate, or that i'm much more affectionate than i ever gave myself credit for, because i actually communicate with these creatures in a loving kind of way. developing relationships with these cats has helped me to see how much i've grown over the past several months. i can trust myself to love another unselfishly - not just romantically, but in general since that's where it matters most.

      okay, so i went to sleep in my clothes last night. lately i've been fighting a serger of depression that's trying to spread from my mind into the rest of my body, but still, i'll pressing on with my decision to stay away from feelings that are encouraging that. i don't want to feel as though i'm not making any progress even though sometimes i think i can't see any. i know i've made some strides and only saying that brings on more challenges. i think that's what this is. last week i read the weekly kabbalah post saying this month will be a hard month emotionally and that i should focus on someone else besides my self. really, who should i be so focussed on, but, i have to admit, i should spend more time praying for others that for me even though i haven't spent much time praying for myself either. it seems that everyone is fine and i'm the only one who isn't. this morning i woke up feeling lonely  - hating my body and the clothes i subject it to. i wish i had money, but really, is that it?   so i've been thinking about lesbianism lately, and i begin to think that i do have resentment toward men. i don't think they're capable of compassion even though they may think they are, i don't see how they can be, but then, jesus was a man who was supposedly full of compassion, but he was no ordinary man. i have brothers who i consider to be very sensitive. i love them very much, and my father also has a big heart, so where does it come in that i feel as if i am uncapable of loving a man, or that a man could ever fully love me? i know that i've experienced abuse from men, but i have experienced that same kind of abuse from women as well, so how do i decided where my compassion lies. lately, i've been overwhelmingly lonely for myself, for friendship, fo love. it's funny though, no one really wants to talk about it. it's depressing to think about it, or to think someone else might feel lonely. it's hard to feel left out and possibly unwanted. maybe there really is no on e out there for me to love, but it doesn't make sense that i have all these feelings reaching a boilling point and there's no where for them to go. i don't know what to do with them. maybe i'm supposed to give them over to jesus, but i'm not convinced he takes these feelings away from us until an appropriate time comes along. i think we;re supposed to find a way to deal with them. anyway, i know this will pass - it always does, and then i'll coast until the next round. it's unending.

      &nbsp; In response to Chad Joines's article:  &nbsp;  Not including Monday as part of the Easter holiday is in no way infringing&nbsp;upon the Christian&nbsp; tradition. The actual celebration begins on Good Friday and ends on Sunday, which&nbsp;is plenty of time to acknowledge your personal beliefs. USC is a state&nbsp;institution which by law is supposed to be separate from the church regardless of the dominant religion of the student body.&nbsp;Furthermore, most churches are not open on Monday, so the only things&nbsp;being&nbsp;ruined are travel plans and bar-b-ques.  &nbsp;  In response to Joinses's juxtaposition of church and race,&nbsp;they are two separate entities and should be treated as such.&nbsp;To compare the two ignores the fact that Christians have for centuries used their faith to dominate peoples of color, and to this day those of&nbsp;opposing views. Consider how this country was founded and the conservative buffoons who run it today. MLK day is a day preserved to remind&nbsp;all of mankind that we should&nbsp;strive for peace and unity whether it be race or religion.&nbsp;Also, race is not&nbsp;something we should merely "tolerate."&nbsp;It's not a choice. However religion is, and everyone deserves the same respect and understanding for whatever choice they make in that area. There are many students at USC whose non-Christian religious&nbsp;affiliations are never recognized and therefore&nbsp;never&nbsp;get a special day off from classes. The Gamecock editorial board&nbsp;was right to state that "Those of a particular religion shouldn't receive special recognition." If the Christians get a day off, then so should the Jewish, Muslims, Pagans, etc. Substituting the word "race" for "religion" as&nbsp;Joines suggested, shows a lack of understanding for people who for centuries have been discriminated against in some way, usually by Christians in this country, because of their ethnicity or "race" as you put it. In conclusion, if you need to go to a Christian private college to have your religious needs met, then there are several to chose from.  &nbsp;  Tamar Moten  Graduate Student  Music/performance

      &nbsp;i can feel my body trying to get depressed but i won't let that happen. i'm staying fit and healthy, and i'm honestly trying my best to keep a positive frame of mind and conjure up as much positive engergy as i can to into the&nbsp;air around me so i can be surrounded by good things. i think part of the problem&nbsp;is that i feel a little lonely since my friend mimi is out of town this week, and i have no one else to hang out with. i think beck's busy again getting ready for job interviews, and kevin has class, so that leaves me with no one to communicate with - really. i've worked 43 hours&nbsp;this week much of the time with the same person, and while&nbsp;he is&nbsp;a nice guy, i've grown quite tired of looking at him day after day. we don't have much to talk about, or i don't have anything to talk to him about. so, we're pretty silent majority of the time. also, all this&nbsp;time i'm trying to find a&nbsp;focus for my cello. part of the reason&nbsp;i&nbsp;don't feel like i can get going&nbsp;despite my efforts to get&nbsp;motivated ( watching&nbsp;videos&nbsp;about artists i admire, reading things) i don't&nbsp;feel like i&nbsp;really know what to do with this instrument - still. i don't want to be an orchestra member, really, even though i've said that's what i want to do because it makes since. i'm a cellist. cellist play in orchestras. there's little use anywhere else. i feel like college especially this year, has been little more than a holding&nbsp;place until i can figure out what it is i want to do with&nbsp;myself. i know chicago&nbsp;will play&nbsp; a huge roll in helping me determine my destination as i know i'll have more options, but i&nbsp;wonder more and more if this is what i need to do with my life. my passion, other than the cello, is helping people. i don't want to live my life solely for my self. i want to be in a&nbsp; place where i can help people get food or shelter or whatever. more than anything, i want to feel like i've made a difference in the world around me - like i've raised awareness in important issues. when i die, i want to be satisfied that i've done my best to be a good person and to have contributed as much of myself to this world as i possiobly could, and i wonder, what has the cello got to do with that? maybe i'm still scared and i need time to think. i'm giving myself a little over a year to figure this out, other wise i think i should move on, becuase right now, for the a while now, i'm just barely holding my head above water.  sorry i ranted on like that, but i just want to get that off my chest.

      i'm currently compiling a list of aparment complexes that i'll be calling over the week - for obvious reasons. again, i'm trying to stay focused on things that are absolutely necessary - things i can tangibly place my hands on with surety.  &nbsp; i've i'm excited about the 3 or so new songs i've started&nbsp; all of which are very cool in my most humble opinion. i hope to complete them before monday at least so i can send them to dorothy. i'm excited about my friendship with her. i can see it turning into something beautiful, as friendships go.  &nbsp; i talked to jenniver o. about my move to chicago in the coming weeks. she seemed to be excited for me. you'll love it, she says.&nbsp; i know i will. things are going well, and my spirits are high. last night i fell into a bit of sensitivity, but i have fully bounced back upon going to sleep and waking. i feel slightly rejuvinated.  &nbsp; alas, i am healthy and strong - gaining more strength and faith as the days go on.

      love is a brewin'. i'm trying to stay on the task at hand these days. there are important things that linger in the air needing my constant attention - namely my cello. i'm also thinking about love and where i fit into all of that. best way to know is to do absolutely nothing about it and see if something happens. really, there is no one so that shouldn't be to hard a task. i've been writing to dorothy lately. how i enjoy writing her. she's so young, but highly intelligent, which is always a major attraction for me. i remeber the time we were really emailing each other. i was so excited about her. i remeber how i was terribly nervous for our first date and how i figured she must've been nervous too, how i injured my lef a few days before jumping up in excitement. she is amazing - caring, loving, and all the wonderful things most of us aren't. she and amy are the same kind of loving person. i'm happy they've both popped into my life, and i'll stave off any attraction i might have for either of them. i suppose it's not meant to be, but that's exactly the thing that bothers me. i don't want to think of anyone in that way. it's never returned, and i hate feeling that way alone. it sucks. so, i'm staying away from it.   i got an email from the human rights campaign explaing the us senate did not get the votes needed to pass bush's discriminatory band on gay marriage in america. if that were to happen, i would consider leaving this counrty. really, it's given me something to fight for. it felt good to have sent the letters to the local senators here in sc, that i somehow played a role however small it may have been in their decision making. i'm starting to learn the sound of my voice, and be in tune with what it is i want to say. sometimes it's hard for me, saying, especially since i can almost never find the words and i blank out mid sentence. i don't know how that happens. in fact sometimes i can't remember what it was i was talking about in the first place. more than anything, i want to have a voice, and also more than anything i want it to count towards something noble and just.   i'm really excited about the number of hours i'm working this week - about 43. it gives me courage and hope for my move to chicago. i'm still positive and prayerful about the move and job - everything surrounding it. i've been thinking very much about the kaballah lately. i don't know what that means, if should investigate or stay away from it. i know they don't believe in jesus as the christ, but interested in their views on god - and i know christ isn't going anywhere for me, but i think there are things out there that the bible doesn't really go into for me. i like the positivity of the book or what i know of it at the moment.   i have to think about a way to seriouly learn the guitar in order to write me music. i have to continue to practice my cello regularly so i can progress and do something positive i with it. i want to be a progressive instrumentalist. that's it.

      a few days ago i applied for an orchestra teacher position in chicago whereas a teacher's license is not necessary. i feel very hopeful on this one. i'm remaining faithful and prayer full that things will work out in my favor if i continue on the right track. positivity is a much more powerful force than i ever reckoned, and i do believe it is the most powerful of them all if only we can figure out how to harness such power for constructive creative purposes. i'm learning more and more about this force as I continue to pray and meditate. that is key.  i realize in my friendship with amy that i may be a little unsteady. of course i don't want to be. i don't need to protect myself from her. i know and understand this now. i do have to guard my heart because of my feeling for her, but i shouldn't disconnect it altogether. i think, in some way, because she interprets my attitude as distrustful towards her, I have caused her undue uncomfort in our relationship. i have to remedy this right away.

      i was looking on line yesterday and found a teaching job in chicago for which i don't need a teacher's license. that is brilliant!!! i'm trying to stay motivated and continue to move ahead. there are parts of me that want to realize that i'm making a big mistake and so i should prepare for that. makes sense, but i also want to be moving forward all the time. that's my only answer. i find myself praying more. not religiously, but spiritually, and i'm trying to remain faithful to the realization that things will work themselves out if i just hold on tight and believe that they will. that is the key to living sanely. i was reminded the other day of mat 8:10 where jesus says we shouldn't worry. that things will be fine, because the father takes care of us all. that was soothing. good to think about things in that way.   i wanted to call chat last week, but something's wanting me to wait until this weekend, and so i'm waiting. i just want to be ready for her when i call. i don't want her to have to babysit my emotions anymore. feels like i'm sucking her nipples. they are huge!  took my care to the shop today. more problems, and i'm trying so hard to not be worried. both good and bad things keep happening, but the good things are out weighing the bad things, so really, i have to be happy about that, and of course, that keeps my mind on the right track, you know? the car is much more road ready now, and i feel much more confident that things will work out in my favor. now, about those brakes. if they can just hang in there.   things are looking up slowly. i'm making better plans and hopefully better solutions to fit these plans. i'm looking forward to the next few weeks to see how they pan out.   life

      i talked to amy last night. we're getting closer to the day i move in. this time, i could really here the excitement in her voice. i know she really wants me there, and that makes me feel very warm - not invading her privacy which she will lose a great deal of once i'm there in her space. we'll both lose that, but i'm sure i'll scarcely miss it.  i have yet to tell my teacher about the move, and i'm not i'll let him know of my decision until after i'm gone. i could tell him face to face, which of course is the adult thing to do, but i remember talking to him about moving to nashvill, and then basically showing up at his office door for lessons. it didn't happen quite that way. i did plan and make arrangements, but felt that it wasn't the right thing to do at the moment, or maybe it was the right thing, and i could have avoided the financial mishap as a result of my staying. oh well, i figure it'll be best to tell him in the face, but it'll be more convincing to write him from chicago since i ruined it the first time around.
