          "CATWOMAN Thirty-Seven" - Paul Gulacy   This cover has a very introspective feel, with the obvious lack of action. Her left leg outstretched, her right leg brought up in front to protect her body from the fandom gawping (And sometimes glooping) on the cover. This direct and obvious confusion of two alternate viewpoints; Laid-back and threatened, would seem to suggest a confusion. Catwoman's face is level-pegging the Moon, the satellite which gave us "the month", a popular publishing unit. Combine the two elements of feminity and the monthly unit and you're obviously led to the menstrual cycle. Catwoman is ready for action and yet not ready. She obviously has the painters in.      "NIGHTWING Ninety Nine" - Scott McDaniel   The obvious positioning of a clock (A method of time-keeping, a storage place for units, a la, the Moon) with the fearful symmetry of a left-leg extended and a right withheld would be enough, but the blood smeared down his leg (With no obvious wound) and his attempt to find solace in comics' classical male father figure would seem to suggest narrative parity's between this work and the Catwoman released this month. Nightwing gets his red wings.

      Obviously I have misjudged the fandom elite with it's excellent taste. RAPE CRISIS hits the number one spot with a bullet ("If any of the events of this issue have affected you personally then dial 0898 GET-ALIFE-NERD and stop reading so many comics"). Only briefly holding back another comic which is riding a poor innocent all the way to the top - Don't worry, Jim! We'll save you! Help is on the way!   Number of titles featuring female leads: 24 Number of Nu-Marvel revamps: 19 Number of titles not featuring super-heroes: 2   And as the ULTIMATE take-over of the ULTIMATE Top Ten continues, we reach the anals (sic) of the NOT QUITE SO STUNNING teens. Normally, a time for ugly sexual changes and perverse thoughts executed in secret... Here we find WOLVERINE: END. Obviously subtlety is creeping back into the comics world, as next month it's DAREDEVIL: BANJO STRING.   Number of even-valued issues: 26 Number of odd-valued issues: 24 Number of animal/insect-based titles: 12   The fact that the 100th issue of GRANT MO-FUCKING-RRISON's JLA languishes at 17 in the charts is a sordid and unfortunate story. But seeing as how DC's latest marketing ploy is TARGET THE RETARD, it's unsurprising. Another GRA-SHITEING-NT MORRI-CUNTING-SON success story, NEW-X-MEN has also sunk to 23 from it's sterling position atop the Pops only a short time ago. When he was still writing it. I sense a mystery!   Number of titles written by Brits: 11 Number of titles featuring WOLVERINE: 9 Number of series titles featuring superlatives: 17   Also, only two team-ups this month. Quite a disappointing turnout really. Hardly the hardy days of yore when you had to print gatefold covers just to get all the teams/characters/side-kicks/passers-by who were headlining the latest mini series. One team-up I'd rather not touch by a creator I enjoy and another one I'd definitely not touch by two creators I wouldn't spot in a police line-up if they were wearing HAWK & DOVE costumes.   Number of titles I actually bought: 2 Number of titles I was vaguely interested in: 12
