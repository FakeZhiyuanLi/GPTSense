"take ur time.. don't hurry to take a decision..." what is this... if i could take a decision on my own then would i ask anyone!!!  bb says: oh dear u r too young.. so don't hurry me : (thinking) am i really??? az  : oh u look older than my dead grand ma.. just kidding!!! me : alright! i don't mind az... (but me sad.. me thinks.. why don't they really think that the    other person has feeling too) me : (thinks) alright.. no one's good enough.. grow up now.. u r old enough to do the right thing.. and do what u think is right!!! me : (thinks) yeah.. finalized... i do wat i want... taking a risk...
