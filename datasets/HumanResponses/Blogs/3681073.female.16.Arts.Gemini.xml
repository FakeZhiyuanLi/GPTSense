       when trying to explain a new culture one of the first things poeple look at is who the people of the culture worshiped. I wonder why has there never been a culture where there was no worship of a higher power? well i've pretty much answered myself. Because it is human nature to need to aspire to something greater, to have a goal in life.  Every culture has it's own variation of a heaven and a hell. A god and a Devil and some sort of higher part of the population known as priest or the like.This, I think, also comes from that need of aspiration and the need of an explanation of ones existance.  -Why do we exist? -God created us. -why did god create us? -to care for the earth. -if god is so powerful why did he need to create us to take care of the earth?  this is when it gets handy to shove into the religion that one of the basic rules is not to question gods judgment, that we must follow blindly if we want to get to heaven.  -What is heaven? -The most wondrous, perfect, happiest place. -how do you get to go to heaven? -once you die if you have followed gods will you are rewarded by going to heaven. -What happens is you don't follow gods will? -then you go to hell. -what is hell?  -the worst most horrible unhappiest place ever.  now of course to know what to do to follow gods will you need to know what that is. So at this point you need to explain those rules. this is where the ten comandments come in And the people who inforce these rules. Or rather the people who keep the population just afraid enough of going to hell that they want to behave to god's will.   -What must we do to go to heaven? -follow the ten comandments. -why? -because those are the rules god set up for us to live happily. -What could someone do to deserve to go to hell? -to not obey god and stray towards the devil's path. -Who is the devil? -the ruler of hell, the enemie of god. -why is he the enemy of god? -because he is evil and god is good. -How do you know god is good and the devil is evil  -Because god told us and is teaching us still  -But maybe god is a liar. -Don't speak thus! you'll get god mad and go to hell   so we've established good, evil, God and devil   so far the only goal in life is to get to heaven. But we have a whole life to live before that and we must do God's bidding during our life    I just wanted to show that the most basic parts of a religion are all based on  theory  and not on fact and for any religion to work the first rule that must be obeyed is to not question what is said for no matter what it is true.  I guess folowing a religion is perfectly fine but I somehow just can't accept that there is no more basis than this  and that people can follow blindly   and therefore I continue my search for a reason for the concrete and scientific.

       My first reactions when I heard that the small town of Huntingdon was thinking about a curfew where that of surprise. I never though of huntingdon as a town with delinquants and runagade teens but more of a rather calm place to live in. Quite clearly the new mayor Stephane Gendron seems to think otherwise. The curfew will be applied starting on july fifth. Once this curfew is applied children under 16 will not be aloud on public property after ten thirty. This is supposed to discourage vandalism and make us feel safer. By locking up our youth after a certain hour of the evening we are suposed to be relieved and safe from all those evil teenagers who hang out in the parks and scare off all who stand in their way. Frankly I believe locking up the most important population a town could have (wich is the one the towns very future existence relies on ) is an abhomination. What does this teach the future generations? Once something gets out of hand locked it up in the basement? Surfing the web earlier I came upon an article from the Montreal Gazette in wich there was an interview with a representative of the Sureter du Quebec. This representant was quoted saying that there is no more vandalism in Huntingdon than in any other town where there is a certain youthful population. If Huntingdon is no worse than any other similar town then why is ours the first to contemplate such a solution if that is even what it may be called. All together I find this ridiculous and demeaning for a town that states quite clearly it wants to make itself a place on the map.Well their place on the map may be close but I do not believe our town wants to be remembered for being the first to chain down the future because the past was not ready to give in yet.

       When someone put a set of rules in place it's for a reason, right? Well usually thats the case... People don't just tell you not to run by the pool because everyone else does. They tell you because you the chances that you slip, fall and hurt yourself are greater on a slippery wet surface.   So what are some of the big reasons people put rules in place?   reason number 1: what you're doing is dangerous and might cause injuries and who wants to get hurt anyway?   reason number 2: what you're doing is breaking something of value example: jumping on the couch breaks the springs and causes the seating to sag wich makes the couch uncomfotable. By making the couch uncomfortable you are defeating the purpose of the couch wich is to have a comfortable place to sit so... Duh! don't jump on the couch!   reason number 3: what you're doing in this specific situation is unfair... Thats why there are rules in a game or competition. Example you take turns playing and each of you plays the same amount of turns before the end of the game unless another rule contradicts it.   I think those are the biggest reasons to put rules in place. Now basing yourself on those rules please explain to this simple minded person wich is myself why my high school would put these folowing rules in place.   1-Students are not to die their hair if the color chosen is unatural.(this means we can't have pink or blue hair.)   2- Female students are not to wear bandanas.(head towels.)   3- The school nurse is not permitted to give any medical remidies to any student whatever the reason without a permisson from one of the students parents ( sure they need to tell our parents if they want to give us a tylenol but if we get pregnant they are bound to secrecy!)   this just goes to show sure there is a reason for these rules. But how will it hurt or hinder anyone if my hair is purple? Are our schools so terrified that they need to stop all self expression?   I know for a fact that our principal is pushing to for us to cover up all tatoos and body piercings (we are a public school by the way not some super-exclusive private establishment) I know many people do not find these things apealing but the world is moving forward and even the most down to earth people are getting piercings and tatoos and some of them are not in places that can be hidden easily. Some have piercings on their lips and eyebrows and others have tatoos on their wrists and necks are they doomed to wear long sleeves and turtlenecks if they wan't to go to school?   If the times are changing then shouldn't the rules do so accordingly? If there are more ways of expression in this era doesn't that mean there is a need for such a thing. What is happening around us is not a jump into the oblivion it is simplty moving forward to the future and if we are moving so quiclky it is because we can and because we are truly prepared for it.   We strive for a future we don't know yet but how can we accept it if we constantly run to the past for reasurance? We have taken a world and molded it to our uses now it is time to use what we have created for its purpose to support our future. So please parents teacher and historians we need to know the past of course it's important but we need to move toward the future. The past is over and cannot be changed but there is so much future to come.   Let us remember our past and learn from it as we move towards a future and keep in mind that even our future will be the past to someone

      The more I understand the world the more I want to cry  The more I see what my future holds  The more I wonder why  the more I grow the more I know The less I care to hear  What must I do to make it through and come out standing strong how can there be any happiness  in a world that is so wrong  A future missing joy of life  A tree without sunshine A child that grows knowing only strife is this world really mine?

      How often have you wondered why we exist? How many times have you stayed up for hours on a summer night trying to see something in the dark?  well the darkness  always seems to get darker and hours are getting shorter, Time is wasting and answers are no closer than they ever were.  Sure you can scream out in rage or lock yourself away and deam yourself unworthy to live while you know not the reason of your own existence or, or you could continue on day after day, week after week  as if these thoughts never even crossed your mind. MOst people chose to go on ignoring the questions but I'm not most people and I don't act like them either. By now you probably ask who is this person? why does she speak as if she's figured it out? well I haven't figured anything out at least nothing you haven't already come to on your own.   The problem isn't that there is no answer or that it is a reserved comodity for those few enlightened well the answers are there they are not too complicated but too simple. Ask a five year old for the truth and they will give it willingly ask a thirty year old and they will offer you a mess of theories about everything and anything and then tell you some fairy tale to back it all up. The five year old might be seen as simple minded or inexperienced but it is just at that age that a person has everything that they need to survive in nature, in the world as it was before it knew of corruption. they are innocent enough to get out of any sort of trouble with truth and honnesty and at the same time they have all the survival instincts input into any race from it's beginings. HAven't you ever noticed that a kitten can survive almost as well as a cat but we trust not our own chidren to survive without all the special care and attention we give them. When a baby cries it isn't for attention but for food or a diaper changing the baby knows what it needs it is our own problem if we can't understand there needs and then try to justify their crying with all the reasons of an adult. THey don't think like adults but they do think.  the five year old has more truth that a fifty year old and if you ask the eighty year old he will tell you so   but guess what I am no thirty, fifty or eighty year old I am a sixteen year old who listened to the five year old heard the thirty year old watched the fifty year old and imagined all the life experience of the eighty year old and told the world about it now it all depends if the world dares to listen to a sixteen year old with a wisp of an answer somewhere in the dark of a warm summer night.

      Have you ever fallen in love?  How can you know that it's happened once it has? Why are we able to feel such emotion? How does this help us?   How can I make it stop?  How can anyone stand it. This feeling in the pit of your insides that tells you to cry and smile and laugh and scream all at the same time. The feeling that finaly somthing in your life is going right but at the same time that there is nothing you can do to keep that feeling going and yet all the while as you are enjoying and relishing in this new found assurance that the world is ok you realise that this feeling is making you fall apart. Everything you thought you had everyone you thought you knew all your perspectives about everything have changed and you realise again that you know nothing and are an ignorant little scrap in what we call a world, a univers. But then you realise thats what this is about, love,  I mean the feeling exists to help us cope with our trivial nature to give us something so strong  we would kill, conquer, and die ourselves before we would let anything happen to the few people connected to us    why ? why are we forced to go throught this how can I make this love stop It is destroying me everything I told myself is turning out a lie an obscenity to keep me in line a line someone drew out of thin air  all I want is to hold him and never let go but the thing is I've never even held him or spoken of these feelings to anyone so is this just an illusion ... a day dream to help cope with my lack of reason or is it real ? I don't care anymore .... Please answer me tell me why do ui feel this way ?   please make it stop make it better.
