        29 and counting   Driving is the worst. I don't get out much myself. I lead a very uneventful life ninety percent of the time, but, Amanda always has a mile long to-do list, and it being that her car is brake-less, and my car being a stick-shift (which she can't drive... actually she can... but thats a whole other story altogether) anyways: Her and I drive around  a'lot  doing errands, and its torture enough to count the days left here in "good old Michigan", but to be in my car, and driving around this slush covered state, constantly having to blare the de-frost, and scrap the windows, my feet slipping below on the sheet of ice that has formed on my floor mat... it's unbelievably tempting to just drive. And to keep driving... until I can turn off the heat in my car, until I can roll down the windows, until the roads are dry and ice free.

       "I hate html"  Sadly enough, it took Chuck and I most of the afternoon to figure out how to add links and change the text color for our blog. We searched through the many lines of html in our 'blog template' looking for jumbled messes of letters and symbols that actually made sense... I haven't had to write html in over seven years, since my freshman year of high school in computer class, and even then I was too busy not paying attention to actually pick up anything educational.  Then Chuck accidently deleted our work. But, in the end, we managed, (...yes I realize the pointlessness of that story...) And our blog lived happily ever after.

      Amanda was selling some CD's the other day for extra cash and she came up with an idea for a bandname. So when we get to California, we're starting a garage band. The Wicked Pickles. I get to be lead vocals, Mike can be bass, and Amanda will be on lead guitar. Speaking of selling CD's, I couldn't believe people will still pay money for them, even if it is only $3 a piece. Unfortunately, I think $3 is looking pretty good for the California fund. She got about fifty total.   I finally sold the truck (a giant '89 F-150) and bought myself a '95 Escort LX. I like the car a lot. It's an automatic, so I won't have to shift in the worst traffic in America, and the body and interior are in great shape. I know nothing about cars, so I didn't really bother asking much about the engine and stuff, but the guy was a mechanic and said they put in a new engine with only 60,000 miles on it. I'm putting my faith in a guy with oil-soaked hands and clothing, but he seemed too dense to be putting one over on me. (I hope that comment never comes back to bite me in the ass)   The room I'm staying in at Jessica and Andrew's place flooded the other day. Fortunately my belongings were on the other side of the room. Actually, most of my stuff is already in the car. I don't have anything to do with it now, so my car sits wherever I park it, ready to drive 2,500 miles (god willing) with all my personal effects in tow. I have to get the car checked out today because the engine warning light keeps coming on, but I'm hoping it's nothing serious.   I had a dream last night and I actually convinced myself not to go in the dream. It was so strange to wake up and think you've done something like that. I had decided to stay here and go to school, because my parents came over and convinced me and brought my sister and lots of baked goods. I'm not sure if my subconcious is trying to tell me something, but the urge is still to leave.   If anyone reading this wants to send us money for the trip, I can send you our mailing address. We accept personal checks, money orders, or paypal. Or you can just ship us a big jar of pennies. In return, we'll send you a very nice postcard of a japanese girl or guy in the latest japanese fashions. thanks readers.

         "Anticipation"   The moment I finally decided I was going to California, I remember a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. There were so many unanswered questions. I wasn't even sure if I believed I was really going. And would I fall flat on my face and have to come back, knowing full well that my parents wouldn't help me out if that happened.  Many times I considered backing out. Even when we were still planning just how we were going to do it. I would sit cross-legged on the couch and wish something would happen that would bar me from leaving. Something beyond my control. I thought about just telling Mike and Amanda to leave without me, or not go at all, and hope that they could forgive my cowardice.  But I couldn't lose my best friends, so I kept planning with them and hoped the feelings would go away. I prayed for God to give me solice and courage that I was making the right decision. My instincts still told me this was the direction I had to go.   Then one day... I couldn't wait. In fact, it really started to bug me that I couldn't leave yet. It's only two weeks later and I can barely stand the waiting much longer. The cold weather is a constant reminder that I will soon be much farther south.  The fear is gone, only to be replaced by the worst kind of anticipation. I know it's the way someone must feel when they are headed in the right direction. I know I am headed in the right direction, and I hope that God will take care of my friends and me.   I have nothing to lose, and everything to gain by moving 2,500 miles away from my home, and I can hardly wait...

        "Brave people do it anyway"   That is, by far, the best piece of advise I've been given lately (possibly ever).   On Cristmas Eve I asked God for courage; I'm getting closer to my dreams everyday, now. I wasn't sure at the time, even what I was asking for, now I think that I have a pretty good idea.   I've told everyone I know and everyone I've met, that I am moving to L.A., since the first time I went to visit my Uncle Thurman there, in the summer of '96. That's been my plan for 7 1/2 years. I guess you could call it more of a dream than a plan; I knew, somewhere in the back of my head, that it might not ever happen. But here I am, less than 6 weeks away, chasing my dreams, confronting my fears. Of course there were so many in the begining, and everyday I remind myself, that "it's OK to be scared, but brave people do it anyway". And it's working. I know now that my fear cannot hurt me, and that God will not give me anything that I cannot handle.   We search the internet everyday for apartment leads and job openings, we look around for things that we can sell, and we've started packing the things we plan to take. We still aren't sure if we'll be able to come up with all of the money we need, but I know that it will all work out. I am more excited than affraid now, after all, the magic 8 ball says "all signs point to yes", "it is certain"..... the ocean is calling me..... this is my destiny.

       So many belongings... so little car space  Well I helped Chuck gather up the last of his things from his parent's house this morning. We filled the truck again... not expecting that one, out of all us; Chuck was the one thought to have the least by far. And I think he still does - but its becoming obvious that all of amanda and I's personal belongings is gonna be tricky to pill into two little escorts.  But the good news is that we found a bike rack that will attach to the trunk of my car, and easily hold three bikes. So 'whew' I can stop worrying about that :) Now just the t.v., and computers, the speakers, the cameras and their cases, the clothes, DVDs, the list goes on and on. How does someone with so little money manage to get so many things? Okay, I have a question, I have two cars; one is a 'two-door Ford Escort' and the second is a Mercury Sable (rusty but trusty). Now the escort of course is the car of choice because its not held together solely by rust and dirt, it has working heat, and it doesn't squeek in the rear like the trunk is about to fall off while driving down the highway, but - the sable has four doors, a trunk (both desperately needed for all my crap), and cruise control (a very nice feature for long trips). So the question is posed: Which car should I take?  urlLink e-mail  me your advice, and I'll post the good stuff on our blog.

       Movies start like this.  I'm moving to California and my parents aren't happy about it. I won't have health insurance, a job, a place to stay, or even that much start-up money, but at least I'll be there. I'll be in Hollywood, where every day is sunny and warm and I can forget there are cold places in the world.  It was three degrees outside today. I'm sure it's been this cold just about every year around this time, but it seems even colder now. I just keep thinking "you'll never have to worry about this again". You might be poor, your job might suck, you might spend 20 years trying to break into an industry akin to a high school popularity contest... but at least you'll be warm... and at least you'll be with your friends... and at least you tried. That's more than most of them can say.  I don't have anyone to bail me out this time, so I don't have any reason to come back. I keep telling myself there are people in the world that didn't have parents to bail them out in the first place, and I'm sure they made it fine.  We're going to be ok. Things are going to work out.

       40 more days.  I'm still "broke as a joke" (as The Girl would say). But sitting here listening to Pearl Jam's live version of 'Yellow Ledbetter' the feeling that everything will work out feels more logical than I'm destine to fail. And I know that worrying will get me no closer to the west.   Everyone's parents know now, we've all broken the news and Chuck's parents were the only ones to have any issues, and no one can seem to understand why.  The three of us have spent our lives working up the nerve to go out and give it everything we have, knowing the dangers of falling flat on our faces 2,500 miles away from any immediate family. The last thing any of us need to hear (especially from our parents) is that we are making big mistakes, and that we won't be helped if we leave and whole list of other un-encouraging topics.   But we are still all going; still all leaving the 29th, we still are going to make our own mistakes, and live our own lives.  Getting off that subject: The other day while the three of us sat around and talked in greater detail about our plans for California I decided to call Bryan Godwin (who owns a production rental service out in North Hollywood) who is a friend of Amanda's (The Girl's) family. It was defiantly encouraging to hear from someone who has made a life in the film industry offer his advice and possibly a job.    Well - its time for me fill out online job applications. So, till that day.

       12 hours left  I'm too overwhelmed to think. The cars are packed. The house is empty. We're ready... as we'll ever be. This is it: " tonight's the night, tonight's the night, tonight's the night ".  I can't promise we'll update from the road, but we will try, there's always public libraries. For those of you who are curious:  urlLink here's a map of our route . It's a little on the scenic side, but we figure this might be our only opportunity to go driving around, site seeing for a week.  I can't wait to be there. And at the same time, I can't wait to see my family and friends again. I love you all. Wish us luck. With 26 hundred miles ahead of us, we might need a little.

       down time  I woke up this morning with my heart pounding 'outta my chest. Its close. I can feel it. I shouldn't even be writing now, but I'm in need of a break. Its strange I'm so ready to go (except for the whole saying goodbye part) but there's so many routine things left to do. I just finished the dishes. The house needs to be vacuumed after we get the rest of these boxes off the floor. We have bottles to return. It kinda' takes the spontaneity out of it, if you can say this was spontaneous, we have been preparing for a month.  Amanda and I are going to try to stay up all night packing and finishing up things around the house. Tomorrow my dad is going to stop by and drop off the love seat (it will stay here until Billy picks it up with the Uhaul. Actually my whole family should be stopping by sometime in the afternoon tomorrow... we [Amanda and I] thought we would have time to run out to Onsted, but we underestimated the mess that would become of our house. It's going to be hard to say goodbye.  It seems like I got on here to say something more interesting. But Amanda starting showing me a photo album from when she was young. Now, I can't think of anything but all the things I have to do in the next twenty-some hours.

        4,000 hits (with some below the belt)   Our website has reached nearly four thousand visits since we first began. It's only been a little over a month and it seems like such a huge number. Now I'm sure we can take into account how many times we checked is (we, meaning our family and friends), but there have been four thousand unique visits that weren't by bots or spiders. The tech-savy know what I'm talking about, but if you're like me and new at this web game, search engines like Google have crawler programs that literally go out into the world wide web and find web pages. The hits I'm talking about were from personal computers.  So yay for us. I'm always under the impression that I have no audience, but it would seem we've started a following.   Mike and Amanda leave on Sunday. I'm elated. I wish I were going with them now, but it's a small matter. I'll be there soon enough. Billy and I are going to try and make the trip as quick as possible. Not with excessive speeding, but without excessive stops. I'm hoping we can make it in three long days. It's been done. Actually, I've done it.  I doubt there will be many more posts from Mike and Amanda for a couple days. They're running around frantically (and I mean that literally) trying to finish all the things on their chalkboard list. Among them were getting an oil change and getting rid of Mike's car. I called him this morning to tell him I got a mowhawk today and he told me he sold the car for $25 to a dealer in Hamburg. I thought it was worth at least $27.  So, to my best friends, I will say simply: May the wind always be upon your back, the sun always upon your face... and may you not spend all of my $1,000 for first, last, and security deposit.   Godspeed Mike & Amanda. Enjoy each other.   p.s. If you were reading closely, you might have noticed I said "mowhawk". Don't think I was kidding.

        Last Night Out       Tonight the four of us went out, probably for the last time before the trip.  As much as I really didn't want to go to Theo's, there were about as many fun things as there were not so great.  I know it's a little vague, but I don't want to incriminate anyone.  Let's just say Chuck's pants are ripped and the refrigerator door is now good for more than keeping the light off and the food cold.  Let's just leave it at that.  I don't really have a lot to say, but I just wanted to put this night on record for ourselves.  Until next time..........

       asking for trouble  It's hard to tell from the picture below, but thats two half's of a futon frame sitting on the roof of my escort. And worst of all, its hanging on for dear life by means of some string and a long white strap I found.      To explain: The frame has been sitting at the Romig/ synergy office (now just Romig) for months, and last night while final cut was compressing I decided to make the most of my time by driving out to Jackson to pick it up. After all; Amanda and I still needed something to sleep on out in California. So I get there around 11 o'clock and there's no power. So, I get a flashlight thats basically dead, and start searching for an allen wrench which I remember last seeing somewhere on the floor. After twenty minutes I find it in the pitch black. But I can't hold the flash light, work the allen wrench, and use the pliers [I found to loosen the bolts] at the same time. So, I carry the futon, in it's entirety, outside and set it in-front of my headlights and go to work. I'm half way done with dismantling it when I realize I need two different sized allen wrenches.  "Damn"!   So I go back inside, the flashlight barely lighting the way, and search on my hands and knees for another twenty minutes (knowing that there was no way the futon was fitting in the escort without taking it completely apart... believe me: I tried). So finally I accept that its not in the room. So what now? I didn't drive an hour out there in the middle of the night to go back empty handed. Thats when I saw the string. Well you know the rest; I spent an hour tying down the frame and wondering if I would even make it out of Jackson before disaster struck. Amazing enough. It held the whole ride home.  Anyways. I have to get back to building a dvd, so I'm just gonna link these next three pictures and not go into great detail about them.  urlLink This first picture  is one I snapped of Amanda while we vacationed on Beaver Island for a week. It's my favorite picture of her.   Next, I have two pictures that  urlLink Nick  (my brother), and  urlLink Mandy  (my sister) gave to me at the going away party last sunday. Nick has been busy teaching Mandy how to play the guitar, he said she is catching on incredibly fast. I can't wait to watch them ' jam ' together. For the ladies reading, yes, Nick is available. As for my sister, my mom freaked when she saw she was wearing make up... but seriously; look at those eyes. She looks like a model, I imagine she'll break a few hearts in high school.  Ok. Back to work.

        storms move across the country do it yourself   The title is yet another google search phrase that caught our website. It's almost like a haiku.  It's nice to be back from the dead. Though Monday was a horrible experience for me, I'd rather it was all done in a day. I stopped puking sometime before I went to bed, and generally felt ok the next day. Apparently this is all attached to some type of epidemic. Doesn't matter anymore. Though I'm sure I lost about 5lbs.  Anyway, I decided I should let everyone know Michelle took great care of me all day. Only to go back to Ohio for her spring break sounding like crap. She got me juice and everything. Not to mention I wasn't speaking (or really concious) the entire day, so I'm sure she had fun talking to my cousin and her husband that she'd met once. :)  All kidding aside, Aurora loved Michelle. When we left to go to lunch together the next day she balled her eyes out and pounded on the glass as we drove away. I felt like crap and so did Michelle, but I'm a heartless bastard, so I just drove away. It was nice to eat again after 40 hours too. That first bite of alfredo sauce is just... well it's more than I can describe with words.  My boss is taking my leaving very well, to the point that he might even be able to find me work in LA. He did a lot of his lawyer stuff (don't know what else to call it) when he still was one in California, so he might know some people to hook me up with. If not, it's still cool cause he's going to write me a letter of recommendation that I'm sure will be very nice. All this and all I had to do was put in a two weeks. Go figure.   Everyone at work wants to take me out drinking before I leave. I don't know what it is with these people and intoxication, but I think they're just saying goodbye the only way they know how. I'm going to something in March that's basically just a bus ride to several different bars with a dinner at the end. You get a t-shirt and everything. I'll look like a real drunk. Not those fake kinds you see on TV.  Olivia talked to me the other day. Sounds like she's doing well. I miss her. I'm trying to get her to see me before I leave but her clever husband must have her tucked away somewhere. There's a lot of people I'd like to spend an entire week with, but it looks like it might be more like a few hours for each. If I didn't have to work so much, I could get a little bit of this stuff done. I haven't even seen my sister in 3 weeks.  So, to summarize. I'm busy and tired. Michelle is good. Livi is cool. Bad brother. Drunk. Work in LA maybe. Too poor. Blathering. This post is dumb, I'm going to bed. Fix tomorrow maybe. Probably not.

        I should be packing   But instead I'm procrastinating on the internet. Mike drove out to Jackson to pick up his futon frame (so we will have a place to sleep when we move) from his old office, and I stayed here because I was packing and didn't want to stop. My goal is to have the bedroom done tonight..... we'll see if that actually happens.   I  can't believe it's already going to be Thursday tomorrow, only 3 days left. Wow. I've been so busy stressing out trying to get everything done before Sunday that I've barley had time to think about the fact that I'm not going to see anyone after that.  I spent some time with Jenny and Sarah on Monday night for the last time before I go. It was so hard to say goodbye. When Jenny dropped me off we hugged close and kissed and she said "I don't want to say goodbye so I'll just see ya later". When I came to the door Mike opened it to see a few tears falling down my cheek and said "are you.." then he gave me a hug and I just couldn't contain the sobbing that immediately followed. I'm going to miss her hugs and her smile and her voice and all of her encouragement. And the way she laughs at herself when she does stupid things and the way we share everything and never judge. I'm going to miss her poetry.      That is Jenny, on the right holding her daughter, Judah. And that's her husband, Abel, and their son, Adam. She has such an amazing and beautiful family.   Jenny and I were brought into each others lives by God, for an important reason, she and I both felt it the instant we met. Although we may not live in the same city anymore, we will be friends until we die. Neither one of us ever questions that.  It's so weird to say goodbye to someone when you know how long it will be before you see them again. I'm not looking forward to saying goodbye to my parents, my sister and Crystal.

       Tuesday, February 24, 2004   10 Things I Hate About Cigarettes       I wanted to say it was nice meeting everyone on Sunday.  I wish I could have gotten to know some of you more, but it was all a bit chaotic.  It was great to see so many people supporting the trio.          It's getting kind of close to 'go time' for me, too, I guess.  Tomorrow I start packing/throwing things out.  That may be a bit difficult, since I keep everything.  I also have to figure out if I want to rent a U-haul or buy a large van for the trip.  I figure with the van I can always sell it and get most of my money back, but I don't know if that's do-able yet or not.  I'm also stuck on whether I should put things in storage here or take them out there and put them in storage.  I guess it will depend on much I keep.  I'm hoping Chuck has opted to lag behind a couple of weeks and make the trip with me.  It's a long trip to do on your own.  It would be nice to have some backup.      Someone asked me the other day why I was going to California.  For those who are curious, I've been wanting to make the trek to California for years now.  I've always been into entertaining and creating.  It's what I want to do in one form or another.  So, around seven years ago, myself and a close friend at the time (James Korloch, an extremely talented man in his own right-I think he has a profile on IMDB.com, actually) decided we were going to make the trip out west and become something.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the we planned and we eventually it was just an afterthought.  I felt like I had let my father down, though, and it always bothered me.  You see, just a few years before, my dad had become stricken with throat cancer and was dying.  I pretty much put my life on hold at that point, so that I could spend all of my time with him.  I loved my dad more than anything else and I wasn't going to miss a second I could have with him.  Near the end, he had called for me in the middle of the night to talk to me.  His voice was just a faint breath with a trace of gravel because his throat had been eaten away by then.  I held his hand and listen to his every word like it was his last.  He talked for a few minutes, but it got to be too much for him.  Before he finished he said, "I love you, Son.  I want you to follow your dreams, whatever they are and don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it.  You're a good person and I'm proud of you."  I remember what he said, because I kept a journal of my days with him, so that I would never forget our time together at the end.  I didn't follow my dreams before.  I let them pass by the wayside and it's always eaten away at me.  Now I have a chance to make up for that and I intend to so, with interest.  I don't know what's going to happen when I get out there, but there is nothing that's going to keep me from trying.  I'm not much on revealing things about myself, but there you go, a little insight into me.   That's my main reason for going to California.  For more insights into me, read my new autobiography 'I Laughed Until I Cried (And Vice-Versa)', on sale in June at a bookstore near you.   -I love you, Dad...

       the waiting game  I spent an hour and a half importing footage from a play I'm editing, I brought it into final cut and noticed; "there's no sound". Then I noticed the timeline only read as being a half an hour long [not an hour and a half]. Something was off. The video was playing three times faster than normal, the aspect ratio was un-stretched, and the sound was missing.  Poop . So, I've restarted my computer and am trying again. I was really hoping to be cutting film by now, I need to get this production out by mid-thursday. So, I'm cutting it close ( no pun intended ).   Anyways, Amanda is in the bedroom making "thank-you" cards for everyone who attended the going away get together. We both should be packing, but she is feeling under the weather and I'm just procrastinating.  I got back our caliblog.com  go west  stickers today. They turned out great. Very simple. We plan to stick them anywhere and everywhere we can on the drive out there. So, if your between Michigan and southern California then keep an eye out. We'll be leaving our mark.  I got the escort insured today, I went into the secretary of state to get the title switched but it was jammed packed. It's basically the last loose end I have to tie before going. Aside from a handful of hard goodbyes I have left.   Jen stopped by last night to pick up Amanda for a girl's night. I decided to give her my first camera, a Christmas present from my mom. I asked her if she ever bought a new one, or if it died on her, to let me know. The camera has very sentimental value to me and I hope someday to get it back. But, Jen has two beautiful daughters, Judah is two and a half, and Eva is only one. Jen is incredibly artistic, and she is with her daughters all day long. I know she'll put the camera to more use than I would. Plus, I always kinda' wished my parents had more video of me when I was growing up, i guess this is me living vicariously through Jen... or something. I wish I was rich enough to buy Jen an iMac and a miniDV camera... she would have a ball with iMovie.  Well, times up. Looks like the footage is all imported. I apologize if this post is extremely boring to read... I was merely killing time.

       the best advise  Today, while I was in the shower staring at the wall, thinking how the hot water never lasts nearly long enough, I wondered where I would be showering in two weeks. I thought about how somewhere out in Hollywood right now, someone else is also busy packing, getting ready to move out of their apartment, unknowingly making room for us.      I did a  urlLink google  search for "california coast" today as I was waiting for a DVD to finish writing. The picture above reminded me of the bike trip. Which in effect, reminded me of what it felt like then to leave for the west. To be honest: its exactly the same. No, wait, thinking about that more, I would have to say: it's worse. I was leaving for only two months then, in six days I am leaving for much, much longer. It's a hard thing to think about.  But I try to think back to the nights before I left for the trip, and how I was completely unaware of how amazing [and difficult] an experience I had ahead of me. And I know that as hard as it is to wander so far from my family and friends, the lessons I will learn along the way will be worthwhile. I keep reading  urlLink this excerpt  from something I have been writing for sometime now, and it helps me stay focused. It reminds me of my coach, and how he always taught me, " no one ever did anything great in their lives without taking risk ".   I know now that it's the best piece of advise anyone has ever given me.

        7:23am   I woke up a few hours ago with my head pounding. I felt hot waves rush up and over the back of my neck. I tried to turn over in my sleeping bag and go back to bed, but suddenly my stomach turned in that old familiar way, and I knew what was coming.   I made it to the bathroom as quickly as I could and realized in about two seconds that I was either very sick, or my food had been very poisoned. After being glued to the commode for a few mintues, the saliva in my mouth started to build up, and a cough turned into a lurch. Then I lurched again, sniffed, and thought to myself, "Why does this always have to happen in Jessica's bathroom?"  Sure enough, I leaned forward over the bathtub and vomited for so long it was difficult to breathe. I bade farewell to my chicken and potatoes dinner. I could feel stomach acid rip through my esophogus and nose canal along with spit and mucus. Tears started to well in the corners of my eye as I held onto the side of the bathtub, to avoid hitting the rug, or Aurora's bath toys strewn about within. The smell was overpowering as I wished I had gone to bed on an empty stomach.  I just sat there for a few moments afterwards, with my legs pressed up against the side of the cold porcelain and floor. I had both arms draped over the edge and spit out the rest of the offending goo in my mouth. Afterwards I was breathing a lot easier than usual. I decided the acids in my stomach must have cleared out my nasal passage pretty well. The adundance of oxygen made me euphoric. I thought surely the worst was over.   Not quite.   And if you want details, just re-read the first few paragraphs two more times. I spent the better part of two hours in the bathroom, lying on the floor, or perched over the toilet or bathtub.   I feel hot and miserable, and I have a feeling that before the end of the day I'll be able to further explain in excruciating detail my sickness. To make matters worse, I have to be to work at 9am. Normally I'd blow it off, but I'm the opener, so I can't. Damn responsibility.  I was going to write an entry this morning about me going to California. I wanted to tell everyone that I am leaving. For some reason, everyone thinks I'm going to stay. You all have it very wrong. I'm not waiting for a thousand dollars here, just gas money and some change. So no more pools or comments, please. It's killing my fun. I'm already leaving a few people sore, so you're not helping any. Sorry to go off there. Just wanted to be clear. I AM going.  However, for the moment, I'm just going to work. Let's hope the smell of seafood soup makes this all better. But I'm guessing it probably won't.

        Going Away  I'm sick..... I feel like crap. But still.....today was a good day.  I woke up and thought I was going to die, then my sweet sista, e$ brought me some medicine so I was all good for the party. It went well, I think. Lots of people showed up, I was actually surprised, something like 60 people total. WOW! It was pretty crazy trying to talk to so many people all at once. Chuck said afterwards that it felt like he "just went to Mike and Amanda's wedding or something". I was so exhausted. But still, I wish it had lasted longer so I could've spent more time talking to people individually. I was just so happy that everyone came, it made me feel so loved and supported. It really made me ready to go, talking to everyone about moving and hearing all of their encouraging words. I know that I am backed by so many people, this can't possibly go wrong. Mike said the party today made him sad to leave, that it really sunk in that we are leaving and we are going to miss so many people. I've been thinking about that a lot lately, and I've even started crying a bit, but I know it won't fully sink in for me until about a week after we're there.      My mom reminded me today that when she left her small town of Pigeon, MI and moved down here to go to EMU, she also was the only girl moving with 3 guys. Coincidence?   My dad told me the story of when he first moved away from home to go to Delta College, he left with only 150$ and all of his possessions in the trunk of his car. He ended up sleeping in the parking lot of the school for a couple of weeks waiting for his financial aid to start. Then he made some friends who needed a roommate and they took him in.   My dad once told me "money is just money, you can't take it with you when you die". I remember that all the time. He also has always told me "don't let not having enough money stop you from going for your goals, just pray and ask God for what you need and he will make sure you get it". I think he's right.

        It was me!      Apparently, there's been some confusion about whose idea it was to move to California. Amanda told me everyone thinks it was Mike's idea. This is preposterous! : ) I'd just like to set the record straight right away and claim full responsibility for this irresponsible decision. Maybe I'm just a little bit selfish to want to take all my friends with me, but I think it's where they belong.  In other news, a girl at work told me she has a friend that works at Disneyland in Anaheim. She said the people that sing there get paid $40,000 a year. She's going to call her this week and see if she can get me an audition. I'm going to have Michelle help me figure out what key I sing in and buy some sheet music to see if I can audition for them. It sounds really goofy to play a Disney character, but hey, $22 bucks an hour sounds pretty good. Jessica said the best part would be that 95% of the male performers there would be gay, so I'll have my pick from Jasmine to Cinderella.   Looks like this will be my last week (s?) at Zoup. It's been a wild ride, but the belt is starting to dig into my lap. They've been leaning on me so heavily the past month or so that I don't really feel as bad about leaving them. I mean I'll be giving my two weeks and everything. Anyway, they helped me and I worked hard for the time I was there. It was a fair relationship.  We're not sure if I'm going to be able to leave on the 29th. Unfortunately my funds are a little bit lower than expected. I'd sort of set a bar for myself and I'm a little bit under it right now. We're still trying to figure out whether Mike and Amanda will wait for me, or if I can leave early with them or what. If I do have to wait, it's going to have to be at least a week. It all sucks. I really want to go with them, but I can't leave with almost no money. I'm just hoping my Michigan tax return will get here before the end of the month. On the plus side, if I leave after them, Billy will have someone to ride with. I was a little worried about him coming over all by himself.   A lot of my old pals are coming out of the woodwork to say goodbye. It's strange how many people I've heard from, wishing us good luck and whatnot. I was just writing letters to people the other day that I haven't heard from in a long time. It's so weird that these people have been a part of my life for so long and I'll probably never see many of them ever again. Stinks...   Someone got to our page the other day by typing this into Google "wait for me to move out west its okay if you don't. i hope you know you're my favorite thing about the west coast. i wish i stayed. i hope you wait" I don't why, but I find that really cool. Amanda says it's song lyrics, but it sounds like prose to me. I'd like to paint it on my wall.   Thanks, Livi, for the comment the other day. Nobody seems to comment on my blogs, which leaves me to wonder just how boring my posts are. (Naturally, this is all just fishing for some comments. : ) But hey, I'll take pity.) Thanks to everyone for being so supportive. We all appreciate all the cool stuff you leave for us. We plan to keep this thing going for a long time, so stick with us.  When we talked about moving to LA, we made a list of pros and cons. One of the cons that I added to the list was that happiness can't be a place. Happiness has to come from inside. You can't just move somewhere that's sunny and warm and expect it to solve all your problems. However, I've thought this through a bit, and I've decided that if you want to solve all your problems, it's nice to be sunny and warm. : )  We love you guys.

        What about us?   People are so upset about us leaving for California.  I know they're going to miss us and it will be a life adjustment for them, but 'Stop thinking about you're freakin' selves!'  Look, I understand that I will be missing from their lives and I don't want to hurt anyone, but their losing one person.  I am losing not only that person, but every other individual person who is losing the one 'me'.  I'm seperating myself from everyone that I love and have had in my life, PLUS carrying the guilt that I'm hurting the people I love, PLUS upheaving my entire life, PLUS worrying about what's going to happen once I get out there.  We're not walking on air saying "Yeah, it's almost time to go to California.  Things will be great once we're there." ---This is a hard decision and we're making sacrifices to do this, and only a few people in my life are saying, "I'm sad that you're going and I'll miss you, but I'm so happy you're not willing to let your dreams die."  Most people are just predicting our inevitable failure.  That's so sweet, isn't it?  'I love you, but I can't wait for you to fail miserably, so that I can show you how right I was that you shouldn't have lived your own life.'  If you're still living at home or under you parents direction, you have no right to make that call because you have yet to truly live your own life.  If you are an independant person with a life you've created based on the decisions that you've made, then you're a hypocrite.  What makes you good enough to take a point in your life and become what you make of yourself, but for some reason the person that you supposedly care so much about doesn't have enough worth as a person to be allowed to do the same.  If we fail, so what?  That's what happens in life:  You succeed, you fail, you learn.  That's always changing.  The only thing that shouldn't change is the love and support of the people you care about.  If you're not going to be there for us if we fail, how are you actually here for us at all?          I love the people that I'm going to California with.  They're a part of my life.  Do I think they have enough experience or appreciation for certain aspects of life to make it without guidance?  Probably not.  But I believe they have the potential.  They're not stupid people, they will learns things they never thought they would and life will probably throw us all for a loop a couple of times, but we'll each be there to pick the other one up when it does.  I believe in them enough to close one eye and take a chance with them, and I have no safety net if it fails.  I just have me, so I'm taking a bigger chance than anyone.  There's no going home to my family, it's not there.  Maybe we'll make our future and maybe we won't find it there, but the only way to truly fail is to never try at all.  Face it, it's a done deal.  It's going to happen.  We have to try.  You have a short time left to spend with us before we leave, it's up to you what you do with it.

       10 days left  In the bedroom, on the wall at the foot of the bed, hangs a giant oversized chalkboard, Amanda has been using it to keep a list of important things left to do before the 29th. Today's list:  Cancel utilities... finish designing Elizabeth's DVD cover... jump the Mercury & clean it out...    I managed to cancel all the utilities and finished the DVD artwork, but the Mercury didn't go as planned. This morning I parked my Escort nose to nose with the Mercury... got out the jumper cables and tried turning over the engine but just got clicking.  So, of course, I waited - hoping the battery just needed a bit more juice. So after about two minutes of sitting in the Mercury, leaning back in the seat, I noticed something: it was quiet. Quieter than it should be. I got out and saw that my Escort wasn't running any-longer. I jumped in the drivers seat only to find that my gas tank had run itself bone dry. Two cars in the drive way and neither one was going anywhere.   For the most part of the day, I just sat around not making the most of my time. I waited [13 hours] as Final Cut exported/ compressed the FutureStars footage I have finished cutting for Pioneer's theatre guild. During that time I spent a few hours trying to figure out why caliblog.com wouldn't load (the server must have gone down). Watched the making of Taxi Driver, studied up on  urlLink Media Carta , read alot of breaking news on yahoo, and talked to Billy on the phone.     It's funny, this time last year this house looked similar: boxes stacked in every corner of the house, the walls without pictures, the t.v. sitting on the floor of the living room. It's been a year exactly today since I officially moved in with Amanda. I wouldn't have guessed that a year from the day I moved in, that we would both be preparing to move across the country. We made it this far... and without much difficulty... I believe that when I say; we will be okay... I am being reasonable. I love you, Amanda.

       Hello...Is this thing on?  Greetings and salutations out there in Cyberland (Well, technically you're not in 'Cyberland', you're in the tangible world.  But you are looking at this message in...whatever, you know what I mean!).  This is my first official entry into this blog, so let me start by saying that---Michael is forcing me to do it!  They have been cohearsing me through this whole thing.  I humor them for now so that no one gets hurt, but mark my words:  Their uppin's will come!  You know what?  No...this isn't my first official entry.  We'll call this my 'clearing of the throat' paragraph.  My feet are now wet.  I'm now in my groove.  So for my first trick... I'll talk to you tomorrow!

       the "artist" type  Earlier this morning, Chuck's dad [Jim] left a  urlLink rather lengthy comment  in the cali: urlLink guestbook . But he was cut off mid-thought due to the max-character limit. But I am assuming that since he put 80% percent of it out there for the world to see... he won't mind my linking the completed letter on the blog.  I only feel the need to post it in its completed form because it is one of the recent non-supportive comments / conversations I've had in the past few days about us leaving. Coincidentally enough: both non-supporters have been conservatives. But, both have used the: " all three of you are going to get a big education. Like it or not... " approach.    And it makes me wonder ; what effect is that fact suppose to have on me? Am I suppose to be scared of this "education"? Should I try my damnedest to avoid these 'life-lessons'? Actually: I can't wait to "learn".  It has been argued that my leaving "sets me back, as opposed to moving forward". And I wondered how chasing my dreams is a step in the wrong direction.

       I'll miss you  My little sister left that comment. The 29th is coming up so fast it makes me sad to think about the family and friends that I will leaving behind. But mostly: my little sister and little brother will hurt the most. I don't know how to best put this into words... with my parents... I know them - they are at the point in their lives where they know enough about themselves where they are who they are... and I know fairly well who they are. And I trust that in the months between my leaving and coming back for any special events, they will still be the same parents I know now.   But as for my brother and sister... especially my sister - its so incredibly scary to leave them behind. She is young enough to change drastically in those few hypothetical months... and I don't want to not know my baby sister... it would kill me. I wish she (Mandy) and Nick (my brother) didn't have to stay behind... I wish I could pick up my whole family and take them with me -  hell , this state is so cold and ugly six months out of the year I don't know who wouldn't want to leave.     The past few weekends I have been spending sundays in Onsted with my family. The last time I was home Mandy wanted to go car sledding. What is car sledding you ask? Take a rope... tie it to the back of a car or truck... grab a sled and have fun.  So the three of us [Nick, Mandy and myself] drove behind my old school since it was one of the only places that still had a good layer of snow on the parking lots. Thanks to the nights before of slow rain; everything was under a thick sheet of ice... it made it much easier to do tricks while being dragged: like spinning around in circles at twenty miles an hour. Fell off a few times but it never hurts (unless you unexpectedly get dragged into an iced over pile of plowed snow... ouch). But it was alot of fun... and it will be one of the only things I miss about winter.  But in closing: I will miss everyone I am leaving, my mom, my dad, my brother, all of my family. I will miss you too, Mandy. More than you will ever know.

       the adventures of...  This is just a teaser. A page Chuck once did as a joke... not many people have seen it, but for those who have...  all of them : have wanted more (including myself). So, of course, I thought I'd put it on display for the world to see... all eight of you out there reading caliblog. And in return I am hoping to get enough response to inspire Chuck to continue our chronicled cartoon adventures in the film biz.   So please,  urlLink everyone take a look ... for those with slower connections, give it time, its a large picture, but I think well worth the wait. Be sure to leave a comment [below] afterwards.  I think this is perfect timing to get another wave of response - with our road trip coming up fast, it would make a great and long waited addition to the would be "adventure of..." series.

       caliblog: grand opening     Finally. Caliblog is up and running. And we couldn't have done it without Andrew from  urlLink getmeonline.net ... no more advertisements... no more picture'less blog entries... so, Andrew, if your reading: Thank you.  Today Chuck and I talked for a while, and I nagged him into saying he would leave on the 29th with Amanda and I. So for those of you who posted your supporting comments... I owe ya' one. I have been looking forward to playing frisbee in the Grand Canyon for weeks now, well... not "in the Grand Canyon"... but in and around that general area. Anyways... now I still get to.   Okay... I'm having trouble writing because t.v. [Friends] is very, very distracting. But the real point of this post anyways was to just see a picture of us on the blog. Its exciting... yes it is. For those of you who don't know already, this is us at a friend's Halloween/ birthday party last year,  from left to right: Chuck, Amanda (the Girl) and myself.   Okay... I have to go grocery shopping now.

       valentines on a shoe string  Valentines Day: Flowers for a loved one... 50.00 - candy hearts... 10.00 - a romantic candle light diner... 45.00 - Saving every penny for a cross country move...  doesn't allow for any of this .  Amanda and I sat on the couch and exchanged v-day cards we both made for each other, my card [for Amanda] had two pairs of cut shoe strings (this has nothing to do with the title...)  Actually this is going to take some explaining: When Amanda and I first met I used to wear a short shoe sting around my left wrist, it was cut from my last pair of running shoe during cross... the same shoes that trained me into state competition... so, of course, they were sentimental to me - and to remind myself of all those miles... all those years of hard work... I always kept it on my wrist. (Until one day I was out with Amanda and looked down to notice it was gone... and I didn't find it... so I was sad) Anyways; Amanda a few different times had mentioned she wanted a shoe string also... so we could both have one ("aww... how cute"). So; finally:  In her card I put two short shoe strings, and we each tied one on each other's wrist. Amanda joked that we had finally 'tied the not'. Then around 8 o'clock we went to see  urlLink 50 first dates  using a packet of free movie tickets Amanda had got as a Christmas present. It was actually cute... and sad a few times (I know... I'm a baby). But unfortunately we couldn't go out to diner... I couldn't buy her a dozen roses... no box of chocolate hearts... we had to save as much money as possible. But it will be worth it when we finally get to see the ocean.

       since tuesday  I got to sleep in today. My past few days routine has been work and then some more work with a little bit of sleep in between ever other "work". Ugh... hence: I haven't posted "since tuesday".  urlLink Zoup!  hasn't been terrible, but it hasn't been great either. I'm pretty sure Greg, my boss, doesn't think much of me. Chuck asked why I was even concerned with getting Greg to like me, I am quitting in a few days anyways. I guess it would be more exciting if I saw how long he would put up with me... but I am guessing it wouldn't be long. As far as 'synergy' goes - I'm in over my head with footage I have yet to edit. It will be interesting to see how I manage to pull it off.  I got an email recently from my uncle Kevin, who [unfortunately] I rarely see these days. But I remember him being around alot during my childhood. And I always liked him - he always seemed to know what to say to make someone laugh, a personalty trait I wish I could say I had, but when it comes to being around strangers - I'm not much for cracking jokes. And it probably sounds funny, but I always envied my Uncle Kevin for that. Anyways, I wanted to post his email on the blog - I thought it was incredibly encouraging.     Hi Mike, I was just finished reading your thoughts and comments you posted, on your web site. I think this is best thing you can do for your self. Being out on your own so far from home will cause you to learn things about your self that you never knew before. I am proud of you, for chasing your  dreams, and not falling into some dead end life of just working to put food on the table. Michigan is a great state, but it is  also a tough state to find good paying jobs. You find it very hard to get a custom to the area and life style of California, but you will find it very rewarding in the end. I hope to see your name on the big screen some day soon.  Good Luck!!! your Uncle  Kevin     If your reading Kevin, thank you very much for the email. Its nice to hear from you, and its nice to be reminded that I have family and friends that are out there wishing us the best.  I have a question for everyone reading. Chuck has recently asked what I thought of him staying behind a little longer as Amanda and I still leave for California on the 29th. His reasons are saving more money, and Amanda and I will have more time 'alone'. Now, Billy is leaving after the 29th, but he (having deciding only days ago) obviously needs more time to relocate.  But, neither Amanda or myself want Chuck to stay longer. We have been counting down the days till the  "three of us"  get to leave for the west - till the  "three of us"  get to spend a day exploring the Grand Canyon together - and hanging out in Vegas for a night. Waiting till the  "three of us"  get to pick out our new place. And if it were up to me, I would have Billy there with us also.  So - the question: Do you think he should stay behind?

        17 Minutes from Night  Work was really slow the other night. I stood around with nothing to do for a long time. Apparently warmer weather makes for terrible soup sales. So I decided to try and make myself busy by changing all the trash bins in the dining area of the store, productive guy that I am.  As I walked to the back, to get some garbage bags out of the janitor's closet, a little flash of orange light hit me in the eye. I turned and looked to see where it had come from, and realized the sunset had lined up perfectly with the peephole on our back door. I walked up to the door and peered through the hole to see a perfect miniature orange sunset and a clear blue sky over the factory behind our store. The concaved shape of the lens made a shining circle to outline the outer edge of the hole.   It was one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen, at just one tenth the size.  I could picture my profile from the side; face pressed up against the door with a little beam of orange light covering my eye. I felt like the only thing keeping me from leaving right then and there was that door. I wanted to follow the sun. I hate that we have to leave in the morning. I'd much prefer the cowboy movie ending where I drive my car into a brilliant sunset.  On a contrasting note, I got a flat tire. Life has a funny way of balancing out those perfect moments.

       Thanks for your support!   I feel so fortunate that my family has been so supportive and encouraging. My dad got my brakes fixed for me today. It's been over 2 months since I've been able to drive myself around, I can't drive Mike's stick so I've had to ask him to take me everywhere...... it sucks. That's one less thing we need to worry about paying for. Thanks Dad :)  Tomorrow will be a long day. I'll be gone from like 11:00 am to 11:00 pm. I'm meeting my step-mother, Badria for lunch to hear some of her encouraging advise, which always seems to put my mind at ease. Before that I have to drop a CD off at foto1 to get some prints made of Mike's mom's wedding that I've tried to send to them through their website 3 times already with  no luck.  After lunch I will be going straight to the tanning salon to start my 1st day at the new job (that I'll only have for 2 1/2 weeks). I worked there a couple of years ago, my best-friend, Crystal, works there and she told me I could start back in January but it's taken a lot longer than she expected. I put off telling her I was leaving until after I started the job because I knew she'd be upset that I'm going and not want to get me the job (which I desperately need). It's been so hard not telling her, the closer it's getting the worse and worse I feel. Several times in the past few weeks I've almost just given up all hope of getting the job and just told her, but I didn't. It will be so nice to work with her for a little before I go, I really will miss her so much (she's been my best friend since the 7th grade). I don't know how the hell I'm going to tell her. I haven't worked since Christmas, that's the longest I've ever gone without working, since I got my first job when I was 16. I guess I have kind of been working, helping Mike run his production company out of our home. Anyway, back to my long day, I'll be finishing up  by stopping by my sister's right after work to hear her tell my mom and Ray some news they probably won't like but that I already know cause I forced it out of her. That should be fun.  Mike and I drove up north to Frankenmuth a couple of weekends ago to meet my grandparents for dinner. It was really great to spend some time with them. My grandma Shirley gave Mike and I tips on how to live on a budget and told us all about when she moved far away from home for the first time and had no money. They gave us a nice card with some cash inside (very helpful) and I hugged my grandpa for a long time when I said goodbye and kissed his cheek. It makes me sad when I think that I probably won't see them again until next Christmas, I wish I had spent more time with them over the last 2 years.   My grandma Betty also gave me a very nice tip when she paid me for some house work I'd done for her (also very helpful with our cali-fund). She has always been one of the most caring people in my life, always doing so much for all of her loved ones. And of course I can't end this without mentioning the oodles of help I receive on a regular basis from my mom and her extremely generous Ray, financially and any other way you can think of. So to all of my family and friends: I love you so much, you are greatly appreciated.  And now I must go to bed... Michael is calling...... again. Why is it that everyday he is constantly telling me to "write a blog" and them when I do, he tells me to come to bed? I'll never understand men. Goodnight.

        Michigan Really Is Lovely   Mark Maynard posted on his website today about our blog. His feelings seem to reflect everyone else's. People wish they could go with us, or wish they did when they had the chance. Yesterday I thought to myself "Hey, I can always join the army if it doesn't work."  My parents are a lot better now about me going. I'm pretty sure they still disapprove, but the talks we have are all typical parent stuff now. "Where are you trying to get a place?" and "Where are you going to try and work?". My dad was actually supportive. I was driving him to the airport and confiding to him my apprehension about the trip. I almost just wanted someone to agree with me and tell me not to go, but he said something like "Wouldn't you regret not trying?" Suddenly I realized, yes. I would regret it.   Quitting my job won't be fun. I'm not looking forward to telling my bosses I'm leaving them. They've promoted me and placed such trust in me. This always happens. I work hard, get a little bit ahead, and regret doing it because of all the extra effort I have to put forward when they finally up the ante. However, it's a small matter. I'll be gone soon and they'll have forgotten within a couple months.  I bought myself a home budget book in order to keep tabs on my spending. I'm going to try and save all of my receipts so that I can see clearly how much I spend on everything. I want to be as responsible as possible in such a chaotic (if not hair-brained) scheme. I'm hoping to put money aside as the months go by to eventually start an IRA for my retirement. I don't mind being a starving artist for a couple decades, but I don't want to die one.  I'll miss springs, summers, and falls in Michigan. I love the leaves and the smell of the seasons. The landscape can be quite beautiful here when it's determined enough. I'm going to miss my family, the tight-knit bunch that we are. I hope I can improve on my ability to write letters and e-mails to let them know how I'm doing. I'll especially miss my sister. I hope she comes to visit me soon.  Well, I'm tired and prone to making typing errors, so I'll quit while I'm ahead. If you're in California and reading this, make sure to keep it warm for me. I'll be there to take my place shortly. Making Michigan yet another erstwhile home.

       100 %  We got the call today. Billy said he had gone into work this morning feeling 90 % [sure he was going], I don't know what made it final for him, maybe it was looking around and seeing the same routine, the same job, the same people he was used to seeing for the past four years... maybe he thought he would miss his friends... maybe it was something completely different.  Around two o'clock the phone rang, the caller ID read Target, we knew it was Billy - he simply said; "I'm 100 %".  He was handing in a list of Targets surrounding the Hollywood area to his TRL (Target slang for: team relations leader). He's hoping to transfer - Chuck, Amanda and I used to also work at Target but we all, in our own ways, kinda' burned that bridge. So, unfortunately, we won't be so lucky. But, its official: there's four of us.   These past few weeks Amanda has been busy emailing all of her 'connections' out in Hollywood. And they have been incredibly helpful in letting us know what areas are best to look for apartments in and so on. And up till today, all of the emails have been uplifting. And then Amanda gets one saying; "we might be dreaming about the price".  Needless to say, this email was kind of a bummer. And confusing - considering the apartments we have been looking at online run in our budget [$850 to $1200] and seem to have enough square footage [upwards of 950] to suite four people. So... are the online listings wrong? Are we somehow getting ghetto apartments in North Hollywood? Who knows.  Good news for me: Amanda has a car! Amanda's Dad paid for her brakes to get fixed. So for the first time in two months; Amanda can drive again. But really we hardly ever go places without each-other... so now she'll just drive me around. But really the best part of it is, that her Dad saved us $350... so we owe him big time for that. Okay - my stomach is freaking out... time to eat.

       help!  I feel silly posting this but, here it goes: we need help with our site... we bought a domain name [ urlLink caliblog.com ] we bought server space with  urlLink getmeonline.net ... and of course we have this blog.   All three work individually but thats it. So anyone who might be reading this if you have any helpful tips on how we bring them all together, please leave them under our comments links below. Thank you.

       entry: 10   Nervous... anxious... unprepared... hopeful... scared...  these emotions (and then some) keep coming and going (probably about as quickly as they can be read). I'm having one of those moments - better described as a panic attack. I can't focus my thoughts, or my feelings, I know I need to be positive, but one after another the: "what if..." questions keep surfacing. Questions I know damn well can't be answered with any other response than: I'll adapt. I'll compromise. Life goes on. I'm just moving...  Or am I?  Is it; I'm finally thrusting myself into the one place where I have no more excuses, no more bull**** to hide behind. I'll be in California and if I'm not filming/ editing/ or writing... at least my own projects then I don't have what it takes. Then I'm waiting for the "vanity crew" or the perfect opportunity, and they'll never come.  The days are counting down fast - and its not only [almost] time for me to: pack up... drive 25 hundred miles... find a new job... and a new place to live - but its time to: "do or die" (dramatic as it might sound).  Am I ready? I believe I am, and that (I think) is the best I can do, the best anyone can do. To sit here and say: 'I'm the next big thing [or] of course I'll make it', would just be cocky and arrogant. And thats no way to go into something as challenging and competitive as filmmaking. No way to go into anything.  19 days and counting.... 19 days.

        Mike is a Blog hogger!   I'd just like to say, (getting back to what Mike mentioned in his last entry) that this blog would not have been possible without the encouragement of, fellow respected blogger, Mark Maynard. It was he who suggested to Chuck that we keep a blog to record all of this adventure, and since no one had mentioned that yet, I thought I should. I like to give credit where credit is due. Thanks Mark.    Our house is looking bleak now. I got inspired the other day and started to pack up. I took down all of our pictures and decorations. I cleaned off the fridge and packed up my candles. Everything looks so white now. I piled my car full of stuff and took it to Rynah and Adara's. It feels so much better to give my things away to people who will use them than to just throw them away. Emily and Jenny came over the week before last and went through a bunch of stuff I'd decided to get rid of. They each left with a bag of clothes and three other bags of various stuff from the kitchen and bathroom. They kept trying to convince me to keep everything but I told them I had to get rid of it, and besides, it's not so hard giving it away when I know they're taking it. I'm actually starting to like this purging thing. It feels good. Like I really am making a big change. Not just moving to California, but really starting over. I'm changing so many aspects of my life, of who I am. I'd say it really started just after Christmas, when I had a great discussion with my Dad and Badria about what was holding me back, keeping me from chasing my dreams. I finally admitted, out loud,  that I was afraid. My whole life I had been so ashamed of this, I'd never told anyone, not even myself. I used to call it shyness.  It's still hard not to give-in to my fear but I'm not giving up. I'm working on it everyday. There's this book called "the life you were born to live". I used to call it my bible. It really shoves is your face the kind of person you are and the things you need to overcome to be happy with yourself in this life. Next time you're in the book store check it out, it's by Dan Millman. It really is amazing, I've given this book to many of my friends and they all love it.  Mike is begging for me to come to bed so I'll have to finnish for now.

        "blog'oholic"   Amanda and I rented 'IMAX's  urlLink Everest ' from Hollywood Video (since I have unsuccessfully tried to downloaded a DVD rip of it for the past two weeks), I highly recommend it - I think its the first time a documentary has ever brought tears to my eyes.  But the reason I mention it is: the entire time I was watching these three strangers coming together to do something so amazing, it sparked a kind of hopeful confidence that had quietly faded in the past few (boring... suspenseful) weeks. I had lost ahold on that feeling of "this is an adventure/ journey/ challenge/ and I can't doubt myself already - or I'll never last".  But unfortunately Amanda is watching 'Thirteen' now, and the movie is kinda a  buzz-kill  as far as inspiration goes. Listening to two underage (bitches) teens...  bitch ,doesn't do alot of inspiring.  I'm only 45 minutes into it and I'm already convinced I never want to have a daughter.   Anyways, enough about that (terrible movie), we got our first comment the other day, by the one and only Mark Maynard from  urlLink Crimewave USA ... it's an honor.

       the fifth gripping week  First off: anyone who can tell me where the title: "the fifth gripping week" came from, will win a box of bumper stickers from SendTretter©. Anyways - it is (coincidentally enough) the fifth week into our decision to move. Only three weeks left to go, and they're going quick. I called about 10 apartments today from online ad's,and  I understood about two of the conversations I had. But unfortunately I didn't really get anywhere, which is discouraging, but it's to be expected.  It's still up in the air if Billy is coming with us or not, but between the three of us, I think we've almost roped him in. So, everyone cross your fingers.

       Working for a living   I hate it when this happens.  Today [all day] I have been moping around the house, dragging my feet, depressed about money, more importantly; the money we need to start a new life.  And (like I said) I hate it when I worry, I especially hate it when I worry about money. Because, everybody knows:  "...money isn't real, George... it doesn't matter... it only seems like it does..."  But, someone must still like me up there, because right about the time I was plopped down on the couch, staring at Amanda's feet as she searched online for apartments in Hollywood, the phone rang. She picked it up, but quickly handed it to me and jumped up to turn the answering machine off (since it likes to pick up halfway through the first ring). Since the machine was on, and interfering with the voice on the other end, all I heard was; "...name is... from... ann arbor... would...", followed by a loud: 'beeep', from the machine. So, naturally, I thought I was being sold something from someone, and about hung-up on them when I asked the person to repeat who they said they were, I don't know why I did this because I never think twice about hanging up the phone on solicitors .  It turns out it was Greg from  urlLink  Zoup!  , where Chuck works, and where almost three weeks ago, I applied for a job. Of course (having spent the whole morning/ afternoon depressed about having no money) I quickly agreed to coming in to train the next day a 10:30 in the a.m., which is cutting it close considering I have a job to film at Pioneer High School around 6:00. But I'm sure I'll manage. So, now between editing and serving soup, I have two jobs for the first time in my life. Scary...

        Where I Find My Heaven   A few days ago I really started to trip out about leaving for California. It seems like I'm on a rotating emotional thing.... (I couldn't think of a clever analogy). I'm afraid, then I'm excited, then happy, sad, mad. Whatever. I'm sure this is the way everyone feels when they're about to do something that will change their life for a year at least. The only Hollywood I know is from movies and television. In all honesty, I have no idea what it's going to be like out there. All I know for sure is that the weather will be nicer, so I don't have to worry about wool socks anymore.  My dad's leaving for Asia on February 8th, so I'll only get to see him when he gets back, on the 28th. One day, and I'm gone. I wish I had talked to him more about everything, but I just couldn't think of anything to say. I don't want them to be unhappy. I'm trying to believe they aren't being irrational, but that's what everyone else seems to think. I understand they're just trying to look out for me, but I want to look out for myself for once. I still haven't talked to them, since I told them I was leaving.   I'm leaving a girl behind... I hadn't thought to talk about it before, but it seems pertinent. I've only been dating her for a month and some change, so it's not exactly like a broken high-school relationship, but I'm still sad about it. We'd talked about staying together and her coming to see me in the summer, but she has two more years left of school in Michigan and I'm starting to remember the last time I tried something like that.  The girl was only an hour away at the time, and it failed miserably. I don't know what I'm going to do. I know where I'm supposed to be, but I've never known who I'm supposed to be with. I don't know how she feels about it. Not too sad I hope.  So that's about it, I guess. I'm ready to go now. I've almost completely prepared myself. I just have to talk to my parents, fix my car, get my money, and ride off into the sunrise.

       "...and it's been so long since I've seen the ocean - think I should..."  This post is simply out of boredom, I have been waiting for the past hour (and then some) for Final Cut to render two parallel video tracks. Ughh... what really stinks is I have been "working" for almost four hours, but I have only probably cut video for a half an hour, the rest: the waiting game.

        This one's about Billy   There has been an addition to our group (Mike wrote about this last night). While we were trying to convince Billy to come with us I was only able to see the advantages this would be for me, but now that it actually might happen, I've been a bit worried; thinking about the possible problems this could cause: Four is a lot of people to share one bathroom, one kitchen, one fridge..... And then of course the obvious.... three guys, one girl..... I'm sure I'll feel left out a lot. I'm beginning to feel this is less about Mike and I moving to california (in a way to start a new life together) and more about Chuck, Mike, and Billy setting off on a mission together to make it in the movie biz and I'm just a tag-along. And what if they hate me? Living with an anal neat-freak could be hard if you're a sloppy boy.

       untitled  On our Pro's and Con's list when we were first discussing packing up and moving west, # two on the con's was: "Billy will still be here."  So, who is Billy - and why would we miss him so? Chuck and I moved to the Ann Arbor/ Ypsi' area in 2001, we both got jobs at Target (where I met my beautiful girlfriend: The Girl) here is where we also became friends with Billy, the kind of individual you meet where you think; what is this (talented, funny, smart-as-hell) person doing here at Target, when they could do so much more in so many other places, especially a place like Hollywood.   Today he told Amanda and I that he is planning on moving with us. I don't know if all our begging, or the coincidence that his lease ends the day we leave for CA, persuaded him to come with. But I hope he comes, it won't be for at least a month after we've left, but he will decide before the 29th of this month. It's coming so soon. Everything is only days away.  "...A chance to turn it all around..."   (anyone know where thats from?)

       Mike has poor taste in clothing  No, I did not pick the title for this blog. Chuck has changed the template from: " place title here " to the above " Mike has poor taste in clothing ". That bastard.      Chuck has been checking prices on Mopeds all morning, we've been talking about selling our cars for some extra cash, so we can  urlLink ride in style . It hasn't happened to me too many times yet, but the traffic jams here can easily add an hour onto your 20 minute drive to the beach. And another plus to having a moped would be parking, our apartment only assigns you one spot, so the three other cars have to find places on the street, which sometimes can be a block and then some away. Not that I mind the walk,  hell , it's never too cold here to stroll down the street. I think  urlLink this one  so far is my personal favorite. It makes me laugh to think of what I would look like cruising down the highway on one of these... but... I will be "cruising" right past everyone stuck in their car under the sun.  Amanda took the picture above. I am 98% sure it's from the first time we went to the beach. I know we've mentioned it recently, but didn't go into much detail, the other day we went to Santa Monica, and "it was good". We stopped by the Emmy's statue, played frisbee on the beach for a while (until the sand pooped us out), walked the pier, snapped some pictures, walked around the Promenade and saw some weirdo in a Yoda costume singing to the beat of a Brittany Spears song (I hate George Lucas). We wanted to make it to Venice but it got dark while Amanda was using the rest of her gift card at Urban outfitters... I hate that place too (I know, I know; I sound bitter. But I'm not, I just think Lucas writes shit to sell toys to his cult following, and Outfitters capitalizes on "cool", which just comes off as a store full of posers).   Maybe someone out there could help me. When I first started using DVD Studio Pro, I managed to figure out 90% of it... except for how to add movies and stills before a menu. If anyone out there reading can help me... I will... umm... send you a free caliblog tee-shirt. We don't have those yet, but I will make one special. How exciting.

We've been bugging him to start a comic strip about us... so we could post them on the blog. And he came up with this, I don't know if it's final for our characters... but it's very cool none the less. From left to right: Billy, Chuck, Mike, and The Girl. Enjoy.

       html is the pits  Holy crap, I've been staring at the screen for too long. As you can see the site has had a bite of an overhaul. Let us know what you think. Because after all this work - if you don't like it... we'll hunt you down and slap your wrist.     [  above: here's a pic that Amanda snapped just before we left Ypsi. Yes... I am aware I look strange, but finding a picture where I don't is too much of an undertaking. So - I'll live with it.  ]  We got our mail box key today, wow... if thats all I have to talk about on the blog then I need to get a life. Hmm. Sorry the comments were down all day, I know you all must have been freaking out. All six of you (who actually comment).   Chuck, Billy and myself wandered down into the subway across the street from Universal Studio's before going to drop our applications. It was even cooler than the one here in NoHo. And it's always empty. We wanted to shoot something down there, I don't know what, the short we are working on now doesn't really involve the metro... but you never know (when you'll need a subway... wait. What?). I feel way too tired to be writing, and it's clear to me I've been watching too much of the "Best of Will Ferrell".   I have a game for you, it's called "Where's Michael" ("yeah, I know... not very creative"). Look at the picture below and try to find me. I'm there... somewhere lost in the desert.     Well... I'm sure that was fun. Okay, confession time. I am just trying to post a bunch of pictures Amanda and I took while driving west. But - even though there is alot more - I will stop here. a) because Amanda wanted to write about them when she post. [and] b) because I am tired, and this entry is stupid and uninteresting.

       We now return you to your regularly scheduled site...     Well, as you can tell, we have been making some changes to the site today, kind of personalizing it a bit.  I think everyone should tell Mike what a great job he did (bravo, Mike, bravo), well, actually Chuck took it upon himself to try a few changes and then spring them on us.  So, really he got the ball rolling.  Then, he went through a bunch of templates trying to find a good one we all agreed on.  We ended up kind of improvising.  Then Mike struggled to make it work (emphasis on the 'struggled').  Just to let you know everything is back on track, so please enjoy.  I'm going to grab a Pepsi and relax.  Talk to you soon.

       day 11 and counting  We've been here for eleven days now. Billy is to my right searching the internet for guitar tabs, Chuck is to my left flipping through iTunes for a song that doesn't suck... and there is a plastic cup in-front of my with a  urlLink giant beetle / bumble bee thingy , that Amanda had smashed in the window earlier... but like all great villains; it's back. To exacts it's revenge.  Anyways, onto the news. Apparently CA had it's  urlLink first power emergency  this morning, the whole state is on 1st alert. So far we're okay. Billy is singing "sweaty palms... sweaty palms... what are they feeding you..." to the tune of 'smelly cat'.  Well... I wanted to put more on here, and maybe I will tonight. But for now - the four of us are leaving to go over to best buy to buy... something. I forgot what.

        Very busy day   We all went to see our first movie in LA tonight. We decided on the Universal City Theatre, just three miles from our place. It's connected to about 30 stores in a long outdoor walk. It's actually a really cool little strip mall type thing. Only every store looks like they have about three times the budget of a normal store to design the exterior. Hot Topic had giant flaming torches, Billabong had a working "ocean coastline" under their entrance, and the Hard Rock Cafe had a giant Fender guitar. Also the movie theatre had a 12ft Hulk ripping through the wall and smashing the ticket sign. They spend more money on everything here. Even McDonald's on Hollywood Blvd has giant film reels hanging above you.  The movie theatre was absolutely packed, and everyone made a lot of noise during the movie. Their reactions were more like those of people at a premiere back home. Nobody seemed to mind voicing their opinion halfway into the movie, but it wasn't too annoying. Mostly we were all just laughing or jumping at the same parts. Oh, almost forgot. The movie was Dawn of the Dead. I know what you're thinking, but it was actually pretty good. I'd recommend it for the non-squemish. This movie has a lot of history too.  I think we'll be going back soon, just to check out the stores and stuff. Billy and I had fifteen minutes to stroll around before the movie started (since Mike and Amanda went to get something to eat) and we didn't even make it all the way to the end. We did see a few places I'd like to go. Turns out LA has a "Howl at the Moon", a piano bar that Jessica has always told me is really cool. You can request just about any song and they have dueling pianos to play it for you. We had a really fun night. Though the movie tickets were $9 and the parking was $8. That's right. I said parking. Get used to it.      The morning we spent at Billy's cousin's party for her daughter. Her name is Azrel and she just turned 4. I almost took out Crystal's boyfriend's dad with a frisbee, while Mike and I were tossing it around, but he was pretty nice about it. We had some great barbecued chicken and her mom gave us some giant oranges and cake to bring home. The oranges are as big as my fists put together. They look tasty, but I haven't had any yet.  I think tomorrow I'm going to hike up to the top of that hill off Mulholland Dr again. It's been a lot clearer this weekend, and I'm hoping the fog or clouds or whatever was hanging over the city will be gone. It was beautiful before, but there was sort of a point where you couldn't see anymore. I wanted to start running again, but the last time I tried my knee felt really sore. It hasn't bothered me as bad lately, but I don't want it to be bad again.  Other than that it's look for work and keep mental notes of the places I want to take Michelle when she comes to visit me in a month. I've already got the two from yesterday and today. I'm sure they'll be more. I've sort of been wondering when I'm going to stop feeling like a tourist and start feeling like a native.

        Dawn Of the Dead       If you like scary movies, this remake of a horror classic is definitely worth seeing.  The group and I saw it tonight at Universal Studios (also pretty cool).  From beginning to end, it's worth the money...unless you aren't good with these kinds of movies (Mindy).  Anyway, check it out...

        Not so bad...    We haven't been here very long, but we've seen some pretty cool things, so far.  One of the first nights we were here we went down to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  We walked around Mann's Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theater (where we took some pictures on a little machine).  We saw a few museums (Guinness Book, Ripley's, Hollywood Wax, History of Hollywood...), but most of the places were closing down once we got around to them.  Three of us wanted to watch 'Starsky and Hutch' at Mann's (which was the current celebrated movie premiere), but one of us thought the admission price was too much of a concession.  We'll come back...     It's seems like everytime we go for a drive, we end up stumbling over something accidently.  I think we've seen just about every broadcasting station and quite a few production studios already, without even trying.  Yesterday, Chuck and I decided to go driving around looking for new grocery stores (food is alittle expensive-$4.40 for a gallon of milk?  $3.00 for a dozen eggs?  That's crazy!) and ended up detouring and finding Mulhulland Dr., so we took it.  The road is a very curvy, up the hill and back down again type of road.  As we started on the road, Chuck noticed a great view of the city.  I couldn't see it from my side and he looked to find a better view from the road, instead stumbling across a little spectator point.  We got out and looked at the city.  It was amazing!  The sight was just like a helicopter shot of L.A. you would see in a movie.  As we started to leave, Chuck exclaimed how after this great sight and all the time we've been here, we still haven't seen the Hollywood sign yet.  Just then, I hear, "Hey! there it is!".  It was right behind us.  How funny is that?  We drive down a little further and found a small hiking trail.  We trekked around it a bit and fell in love with the area.  I think we'll start going there on a regular basis.  The day before, we found a HUGE park that seems to go on forever.  It's right next to the L.A. Zoo, apparently, but we didn't see it.  It had a little Choo-choo for kids to ride on, which is nice.  There was a softball field with a lighted scoreboard, and mountains...lots of mountains (very green, very pretty).  There was a small film crew there, as well, but we couldn't tell what they were setting up for and we had places to be.  Actually we had nowhere to be, but whatever.  It's so funny, when I left Michigan I said goodbye to nature, but I've seen more nature in the last few days then in a year of being in Michigan.  It was beautiful.  If you get a chance, come see it.  Our couch is always open...

        view from the top   A week in Los Angeles and I finally saw the Hollywood sign. Billy and I drove along Mulholland Dr today and stopped at a little park on the side of the road. The view was spectacular. We hiked to a peak in the mountain and looked out over the entire city. It's possible I've seen more beautiful things in my life, but I wouldn't be able to remember what. The sun was shining brilliantly, and for a few minutes we were the only two people at the top. I want to go every week. I wish Michelle could have been there.  The only thing I have left to see is the ocean. 2,500 miles and I still haven't seen the ocean.  p.s. It's true. I have been sleeping on the balcony.

        It's Late, I'm Tired   So, I'd intended to write a good long post tonight, but then I started replying to all of the folks who've emailed me in the last week or so and now (several hours later) it's 1:30 am and I'm ready for bed. But I thought I should say at least something (and hopefully I'll have more time to write tomorrow). Shitty things about today.... A) we got stuck in a traffic jam for and hour and a half then gave up and turned around, so we ultimately spent 3 hours in the car and didn't get anywhere. B) Mike put a completely full, x-large Dr. Pepper on the dash and then pulled out of the Taco Bell drive-through spilling the entire thing all over my car (not fun to clean up), also: they put cheese on my rice, didn't give me a spoon and mike's quesadilla was the worst he's ever had. C) It is sunny and beautiful all 3 hours we spend in the car, then the second we decided to get out and eat our food at the park, the sun goes behind a huge cloud and we're shivering... and of course we get back in the car... the second the sun comes back out (no lie). I know not many of these things would be all that bad by themselves, but one after the next.... kinda made our day suck. So we decided to go home.... and stay there. On a good note.... A) In the car today, as Mike and I were approaching our traffic jam, I looked over and saw 2 deer eating on the side of a hill (mountain), then a few seconds later I saw 1 more eating from a tree. How nice, I thought. It feels really good to just be driving all normal like, thinking about life and what you've got to do that day, and then you look up and see mountains and mountains, all over in the background, that you didn't even notice before and you think... Damn.. That's beautiful... that's why I came here. B) We put up our giant chalk board (the one we saved from the Whole Foods garbage pile) in the kitchen. C) I got our bathroom all unpacked and set-up, I even put up a toothbrush holder and some towel hooks. D) Mike, Chuck and Billy spent most of the night brainstorming ideas for the short they want to do. I'm not sure if they got anywhere. Eventually, Mike took off for a run, Chuck left on his bike and Billy retired to his room, so I decided to write.  A few side notes: Chucks been sleeping out on the balcony (he says it's great), we can walk to our grocery store in 3 minutes (it's a block and a half away), people hand out free movie screening passes on the street, Chuck and Billy found the Hollywood sign today, there must be like 30 sushi places in a 2 mile radius of our apartment. I know there's lots more but I'm too tired to think straight now.... more tomorrow.  Night- night.

       stop the fcc!  I was doing some catching up on  urlLink Die Froschkonigin , and stumbled across  urlLink this link .  Is there anyone else out there tired of the FCC telling everyone and everything what they can  urlLink watch, hear & see ? Their definitions [restrictions] of "indecent" are beging to effect  urlLink all forms of media .    "C'mon, give it a look, you don't have to sign anything." - cristen    Okay. That's all I have to say about that.

        Getting there is half the fun???    O.K. I know I haven't really posted too much in the last week since we left for California, so let me get back on track.       So we're all set to go Monday, the 15th of March, that's good.  I'm supposed to pick up the truck at 9:00 a.m., but they call and tell me they don't have it yet.  So I finish getting my things together, which it turns out is WAY too much crap.  Chuck comes over ready to move...doesn't happen.  The truck place finally calls.  The truck I was supposed to have needs some work done.  I have to take a 20 ft one in it's stead.  So now I went from a 10ft. box truck to a 15ft and now a 20ft. truck plus a car dolly.  So, now I'm going to be going down the road measuring about 38ft. long.  That should be easy enough to get around in.  My friend Keith takes me to get the truck.  It's huge!  He laughs at my situation as only Keith can  (friends are funny that way).  My first little drive home with the truck...not so good, but I got better.  My roommate and I get some things loaded up, but for some reason, the pleasant we had been experiencing had begun to turn piercingly cold, so that was good.  I decide finish loading Tuesday during the day, when it warms up.      I get up Tuesday to find out that Michigan has decided it was time for a little snow...ALL DAY!  We get a little bit done, but not much.  I'm starting to get a reservation or twelve about the move.  It's not good.  Chuck decides to give me some space for a day.  What a guy.     So, we finally leave Wednesday afternoon.  We are on the road.  It's all down hill from here, right? Thhhhppt!  We stop by Target on the way out to clean out my desk and I say some last goodbyes, then we ran to Meijer for some last minute provisions.  There I saw Mary, a girl from work.  She was the last person I saw on the way out of town.  Bye bye, Michigan.    6:15p.m.-We leave Target   7:47p.m.-We leave Michigan and hit Indiana.  We stop to fill up just before the border and it costs 60 freakin' dollars!  That was not a good sign.  By Terre Haute, I was out of it.  I hadn't gotten much sleep that week and it was catching up with me.  We stopped at a cheap hotel and slept.  It was nice.  In the morning, the lady at the front desk talked to me about the trip.  She actually asked for my autograph, just in case.  I obliged her and then wrote the Caliblog address on the back.  That was pretty cool.   -THURSDAY-   12:08p.m.-Welcome to Illinois!   12:45p.m.-The time zones changed.  It was cool Chuck was looking at his phone and it jumped back an hour.  I guess that means we're making better time now.  We just gained an hour on the trip.  We had to make unscheduled stop around 2:00 p.m. because Chuck had to tinkle-winkle.         3:15p.m.-Hey!  The St. Louis Arch!  I've never actually seen it.  It's pretty sweet, actually.  There are some big riverboats along the river below.  Chuck risked his life to get a picture for you all, in case you haven't seen it.  We actually circled all around it, so we got a pretty good view.    3:17p.m.-Welcome to Missouri!  Just for the record, St. Louis has lot of freakin' brick buildings, Mama!   4:23p.m.-Chuck and I were curious about Route 66, so asked a girl at a gas station across from Six Flags and followed her directions to a road that didn't look all that 'magical'.  Apparently 'Business 44' and 'Route 66' are the same.  That's why we couldn't find it on the map.  Ten minutes of sucky traffic was long enough if not too long.  There were no hookers or anything!  Back to the highway, where it's a little more interesting.  Side note:  Don't ever stop in Rolla, Missouri.  Trust me.   5:00p.m.-Oklahoma, quite possilbly the worst state in the entire country for more reasons than I care to list.  Oh, if you ever go to Oklahoma City, DO NOT stay at the Regency Inn.  You'll wish you hadn't.  We ended up getting a handicap suite, apparently.  The bathroom was about 18 ft. wide and the shower was about 3 1/2 ft. tall and no wake up calls, just an alarm clock that doesn't work anyway.  I was awoken half-naked by the cleaning lady.  I invited her to jump in and catch an extra 15 minutes of sleep, but she declined...or did she?  Rock on!   -FRIDAY-   12:35p.m.- urlLink Shake it, baby! Shake it !       3:15p.m.-Welcome to Texas, good riddance Oklahoma!  Soon after the border we pass the second of two gaint crosses.  The first one was way back in Missouri, I believe.  Chuck snapped a picture of the first one.  This one, though, has a platform at the bottom encircled with men, possibly Jesus, carrying the cross in a partial circle.  At the top of some stairs are Jesus and the two criminals crucified on the cross.  No church around or anything, just like the last one.  Does anyone know who did these?  I'd like to know, myself.   6:58p.m.-We are now in Mountain Time.  It feels a lot like the last two time zones, actually.  One minute later, we enter New Mexico.  Now this is more like it-very beautiful!  The desert, the brush, the mountains-very peaceful.  As we drive into the mountains the sun starts to set, which is nice, but since we're driving directly west, guess where it's going to be.       The sun falls right on the highway to the point where I can't even tell where Chuck is in front of me.  I'm getting a bit nervous. For about an hour, we burn out our retinas to the point that we can't even see anymore, plus we have horrible headaches now.  I can make out, just barely, the first sign to get to Vegas at about 9:18, but by this time we just want to get to California.  Hey, apparently today (March 19) is Bruce Willis' 49th birthday.  My original inspiration to break out of my extreme introvertness when I was younger.  Man, I LOVED 'Moonlighting'.    -SATURDAY-   4:20a.m.-We made pretty good time this stretch.  We are now in Arizona.  A lot like New Mexico.  Of course, it's pretty dark right now, so maybe I'm wrong.  We pull in to Target to take a quick nap just before we hit the last highway switch before Cali.  We wake up to the amazing sight of this huge snow-capped mountain directly in front of us.  It was breathtaking, to say the least.  Well, time to get back on the road.   1:55p.m.-California, here we are!  San Bernadino and the beginning of the Mojave Desert, God's big ol' ashtray.  This thing is fierce, man.  Neither Chuck or myself would be surprised if we died out here.  I thought the deserts in NM and AZ were desolate, but this is ridiculous.  It just doesn't stop, for crying out loud!  Well, we DO eventually make it out of the desert, but Mike and Amanda are going to be gone when we get there, so decide to stop and eat at one of my favorite eateries, KFC.  Not very impressed with it.  Everything tastes completely different!  This sucks so bad.  But not as bad as when we get back to the parking lot and find out there's no through route in the lot.  I CAN"T GET THE TRUCK OUT!  After a short while of being guided by couple of different by standards, I wiggle it out, but only by inches, if that.  Back on the road, as much as I wanted to avoid driving straight through L.A., we are directed differently.  It took an hour, a half of a tank of gas, and a lot of control to get that truck down the L.A. freeway.  All I could think about was tearing off Mike's legs and beating him with them.  That was my driving force.  We did, obviously, finally make it.  After a short time being stuck in the driveway for lack of other places to put the truck,  urlLink we were welcomed home as seen in Mike's video clip .  That part was pretty nice.  We are finally here!  WooHoo!  Now comes the hard part...   Well, that should cover me for a few days.  I'm sure that most of you will skim through this instead of read it.  I just wanted to have a small account of our trip in here.  Trust me, it's small.  I cut out a few things here and there, but you get the idea.  IT SUCKED!!!   ...but I'm feeling much better now.

       stats don't lie  Okay - we know you're out there. We know we have followers. The site stats don't lie, but our guest-book does. Just last month we had almost 5,000 hits, and this month (with a week and half left) we have over 9,100 hits. Just today we had above 300 hits... but we're all wondering why none of these people sign the guest-book. Why?  Ok, so none of us sign guest-books either, but we'd really like to know who's watching us. So if you can take even a minute to drop a line on there, we'd appreciate it. And if you've already done it, thank you. We appreciate the heads up.

       sneak peek  Well, this isn't the 'tour' of our apartment I was planning on posting [that will be coming soon]. But,  urlLink this is a sneak peek  into the documentary I've been making about our move [which I will put on DVD after I finish 'Bye Bye Birdie'].   What your watching is Amanda and I making our "welcome home" sign for Chuck and Billy only a few hours before they arrived. Then the rest is fairly self explanatory. Stay tuned for more after a quick commercial break.

       stay west     Internet is nice. Especially when it is free [and wireless]. I'm sitting on the porch right now; Chuck's VAIO on my lap, the silhouette of several palm trees against California's purple sky to my left, the mess of an un-packed apartment to my right. Chuck is busy snapping digital pic's with his camera inside. Billy is chatting on AOL and Amanda is having a blast organizing the bedroom. The night weather feels perfect right now. I could go for a nice walk right now.  This is difficult: there is so much to right about, that I can't decide what to start with, and I keep sitting here getting no where. People reading this are probably under the impression nothing exciting is happening here and it's quite the opposite. Chuck and I drove down the block this morning and played Frisbee for a while, but somehow, it was overcast today. Which was a first, it's defiantly been the least appealing weather we've [Amanda and I] had since arriving.   I've been looking forward to shooting a short my brother gave me before I left. You know the one, Nick. It making me antsy just thinking about it. Actually I have alot of editing I should get to first. Damn t.v. is distracting! Kevin Smith is being interviewed about 'Jersey Girl' on some late night show. Now it's 'Family Guy'.   Chuck today said our daily hits have more than doubled since last month. Looks like were getting a little bit of a following. Amanda the other day at the library got an email from a girl who spotted one of our 'caliblog' stickers at a Love's gas station. It sounds like they might become 'pen-pals'... but not with pens... yeah. Anyways, here are the pic's Chuck was busy snapping earlier. [ urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ,  urlLink 3 ,  urlLink 4 ,  urlLink 5 ,  urlLink 6 ] Enjoy.

        Internet is good   Well, we've finally spent our first few days in North Hollywood and the reviews are in. California is great! It's been exhausting and emotional, but I think we're going to pull through here. We're all starting to get settled in the apartment. Boxes are being closed up and slid under beds until the next move. Items are being placed where they will probably sit for a long time without being used (i.e. books and movies). It's starting to feel like home and one big happy family.  Many many things are very different here. Los Angeles is a crazy place. The people drive like maniacs (Mike is adapting well), the women are beautiful (thanks to the latest scientific advances), and the gas is very expensive. I've applied for work at a few places and seem to have gotten some positive feedback. Hopefully, I'll be working at a place called Trader Joe's soon, which is a lot like Whole Foods in Ann Arbor. They sell all the stuff you can't buy at the regular market, and they're apparently in the top twenty shopped stores in LA.   The apartment is great. There's tons of space and the price is right. Billy and I share a room, and Amanda and Mike live across the hall. The neighbors next door sold us a really great table for all three of our computers. Speaking of which, we have internet right now thanks to sort of an accident. We're piggybacking on another tenants wireless connection. It happened today when I turned my wireless card on. So, we have a cable modem and cable TV without paying for either. What a country. :) And just so nobody gets crazy, yes, we will be paying for our own connection. (Only because Mike's computer won't hook up.)  There's so much I'd love to tell everyone, but tonight is another night spent settling in. All I can say is this. It was worth it.  Here's a picture we took for free at a photobooth in the Chinese theatre. More on that tomorrow.

       Are you still out there?     Well, I finally get to post online from California.  The trip was the most excruciating three days EVER.  Luckily, Mike and Amanda were here in our new place to welcome us with open arms.  So far, besides the different businesses, it's not all that different.  The place we are living is pretty laid back, we are in the Arts district of NoHo.  No job so far.  It looks like I definitely have one unless my Human Resource person is absolutely no help or even damaging to my transfer (She does have a habit...)  I'm getting kinda used to the area around where we live.  I mean I could find it...eventually.  I would have written sooner, but I couldn't seem to log on from any outside computer.  Still not unpacked or unloaded, for that matter.  I did get to go to Mann's Chinese Theatre, though, and that pretty much satisfies my Hollywood sightseeing needs.  I'm not going to write much, right now.  We're in the middle of moving some things around, but I will definitely have plenty to say tomorrow, so please come back.  I'm glad we had this little talk. Ciao!

        we're there   With some degree of difficulty, we've finally arrived here in California. The trip was long and difficult, the gas was expensive, sleeping in a car sucks, and I'll be sunburned for a couple days, but we're alive.  I can't say much, because I'm in a public library and I only have fifteen minutes, but I just wanted everyone to know we were here and we'll have internet in a couple days. Thanks to everyone for your support. We love you all. I'll talk to you all soon. : )  p.s. the weather is perfect.

        it's been three weeks since i've had a home   in about 15 minutes mike and i are meeting the landlord to pick-up our keys. i'm so happy, i don't know how to describe it. i can't wait to unpack my things and settle in, buy groceries, decorate with candles and pictures of my friends and family. i can't wait to RELAX.  i changed our time zone (for the blog) so from now on when we post it will list it in our (cali) time.  we are getting our internet turned on on the 23rd, so there won't be any new posts for a while, sorry. but when we are back on they will be good, promise. lots of pictures and everything:)  i wish i could write more but we have to go now. billy and chuck are doing fine, they are almost to new mexico by now i think.   thank you tim and tricia for all you have done for us, (letting us stay with you and making us feel at home, cooking us great dinners, the wine, the great talks, the maps and cool books, the list of apartments you talked your friend paul into getting for us, the jobs at nielsen, the intern list, the help with resumes, cover lettters, apartment search, all of the great advise, anything else i forgot about...) we'll never forget it. i wish there was someway we could repay you (if you ever think of anything please let us know).  bye for now.

       one more day  I keep thinking I move in tonight... I've told myself ten times today; "no... it's tomorrow night". I'm getting antsy though, last night after Amanda and I ate at our favorite Chinese food restaurant we thought we would go take a look around, maybe peek in the windows (even though it's on the second floor). Plus; Amanda hadn't seen it yet. Since everytime we went together to view an apartment, no one seemed to buy that she lived here and was just my friend... they all wanted her to fill out an application (but... her credit is, well, bad). Anyways, I'm starting to ramble. Onto the point:  It was around 10 o'clock here and we had been busy walking around looking at the greenery and scoping the porch from the sidewalk, trying to figure out what parking space would be mine (I'm in number 7 even thought we have apartment number 9... strange), for whatever reason we decided to try the door, and for whatever reason it was unlocked. So, we wandered in, but it was pitch black because the power isn't getting turned on until tomorrow afternoon. Long [and boring] story short:  We couldn't find a flash light in the car - the neighbors across the hall (while we looking for a flashlight) locked the door because they thought someone was breaking in - then they saw it was me - let me back in - and gave me a flashlight.   Amanda really liked it though, I did good, she said. It has lots of space, a fridge (which is rare here), lots of storage space, tiled kitchen counters, a balcony, two baths, two bedrooms (obviously), a dining room area, a big living room, lots of water pressure (Chuck will like that), it's in a nice neighborhood, surround by palm trees, two blocks from the red line (which goes straight to Nielsen), and a whole list of other little things which are no more exciting to read about than any above.  Chuck and Billy have been keeping us up to date from the road. They crashed a hotel last night and are hoping to bust out a good twenty hour day (I think they might be crazy... Billy can only drive 60 mph since he's dragging a car behind his half-a-semi). Yesterday I was in a book store (that used to be an old styled movie theater) reading ' urlLink Dude, where's my country? ' (very good book actually) and Chuck called me up on my cell, he was so excited to finally be on the road. He said just before leaving, while eating at Bob Even's, he started to wonder if this was right, but as soon as he got in his car and hopped on the highway, he knew this was it. This was what he was supposed to do. No regrets.   I agree [more and more everyday].  To answer some quick questions people have been leaving in the comments:    ...what does your jobs involve and did Amanda quit the other one? - Love ya, Mom    Our jobs at Nielsen are pretty much just market research (a fancy term for telemarketing) but we don't sell anything, just ask people about their movie going habits, who they like, and vice versa. It's easy and it has very flexible hours. And yes, actually just today Amanda left her job at j. jill to work at Trader Joes (basicaly Whole Foods) and  part time  at Nielsen.     Awesome! You gotta place! That's an answer to prayer. Hey, I have been reading all your postings, and haven't seen any kind of credit given to the kentobean for playing a MAJOR role in bringing the California Dreamers together! SUP WITH THAT!?  - Kentobean     Kent... It's good to hear from you. I don't know how that happened :) but Amanda is going to soon give credit where credit is due, and write a very nice long blog entry about how different our lives would be if it weren't for you playing Cupid. So, stay tuned.  Well, I was planning to answer more questions... but the internet here is starting to take a crap.

       in writing  The lease has been signed. We move in the 19th. The walls need painting and the carpet is going to pulled up and replaced. In the mean time:  It was Amanda's day off from j. jill and we've been waiting for a nice day to go to the beach. Since it was sunny as hell all morning we decided after a few errands we would head out to Venice. Traffic was backed up on the 405 but we eventually made it and then out of no where: fog. Or more like mist, coming off the beach with the wind, it became very cold, and very hard to see. We still strolled around walking in and out of the different shops, watched a few boom-box performers do there thing infront of small crowds. Bought a Mexican-styled throw to cuddle up with on some rocks by the shore. It was relaxing... a little chilly... but relaxing.  Well, I'm a little sleepy and both Amanda and I have to wake up tomorrow and get to Nielsen in the morning for our training. Only three more days till we move into our new home. I can't wait to buy groceries... is that strange?

       Someone up there still likes me  I know the past two weeks must have been a test of some kind, cause I feel whipped, and it's not over yet, it's straight onto job hunting for me. But, yes, the good news is just in: we have a place! We did it! Actually, we had alot of help (Thank you everyone! You know who you are). But I go in tomorrow at noon to sign the lease. That was a close one... to be honest, I was starting to get really, really worried. Best of all this place, is a month to month lease, so we can keep looking on the side - there are far bigger and better apartments in the area there's just a wait - so this is even better than we had imagined.  The interview at  urlLink Blackbox digital  went really well today (thanks again, Tricia), they just finished doing the effects for  urlLink HellBoy  [I thought Billy would like that], but the place was awsome; like some dream office: artsy, sleek, friendly, laid back, but still fast paced, I loved it. And best of all: they use Mac's. They got a whole room of G4's and G5's connected to run the effects programs. I almost wet my pants.  Amanda and I went for a walk down the Santa Monica pier last night. Thats where Palisade's Park is at ( urlLink like the song ... and the movie Confessions of Dangerous Mind) but while we were busy watching a crazy guy balance all kinds of stuff using his mouth, the rides all shut down, we turned around and it was dark. But we still wondered down to the end of the dock, looked out at the black ocean. It was nice to relax for a moment, and not have to be driving around like mad looking for jobs and place to live. Actually work doesn't seem to be too hard to get around here, its just a place to call home. Very different from Ypsi.    "Ever notice that 'what the hell' is always the right decision?"    --  Marilyn Monroe    I've been here for two weeks and its finally starting to set in: were going to be okay, things are going to work out.

       So...here we go!    Well, today's the day.  I have a few things to take care of and then that's it, but the computer comes down now, so I figured I get in one last entry.  I picked up the truck today and it's huge!  They had to give me a twenty foot truck because my truck was having mechanical problems.  I don't like it...  Chuck doesn't think we'll make it out today, because my apartment is a mess, but I'm going to try.  He and Michelle are actually in the other room.  He thinks I'm packing as we speak, so 'SHHH', don't tell him.  I still have to pick up Amanda's couches too, but she didn't leave me a number to get in touch with her mother.     Before I go I just want to thank everyone again for their support.  You've all been great.  The next time I talk to anyone I'll be on the road with Chuck.  So everyone take care and pray for us and for those I didn't get to see, it wasn't because I didn't want to, there just didn't seem like enough time in a day to do everything I wanted to do.  I'll make it up to each you.  Well, it's been fun, but back to work.  I'll talk to you all soon enough, God willing.  All my love, Billy...

        hardest goodbyes   This post will be brief, since there's a lot of work left to do today, before we leave. I just wanted to thank everyone that helped me out so much. Jessica, Andrew, Joe's parents, my boss, Michelle, Mark & Linette. I love you all. And to my family, since it might be a while 'til we see each other again. You guys take care of yourselves. Keep the clan tight.  Billy and I will be leaving at dusk today. We're packing up his truck, chillin' out for a little bit, catching an afternoon matinee and maybe something to eat, then we're headed off into the sunset. Well, actually, we'll be going south first, but you get the idea.  It's been incredibly hard to let go. There are so many exciting opportunities ahead of me, and all I can think about is all the things I'm leaving behind. My family, my friends. A girl that treats me much better than I deserve.   It's been emotional and I can't think of anything to say. I miss my friends and I look forward to seeing them. I wish it wasn't going to take three hellacious days of driving to get there, but it's a small matter.  I hope we make it. I hope I can see my friends and shake their hands. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams... I hope...    As for now, it's radio silence...

       Man, Am I Tired!        I went out tonight with some friends for a last night out type of thing and I have to say, I don't think I can take saying goodbye to many more people.  Friday, on my last day of work, they had a small goodbye party for me, which was really nice.  People each gave a little speech about me and a got more than choked up.  Afterwards, I went to Stockbridge, where some of my family and friends live and it was more of the same.  I think I cried on ten different occasions that day.  The strangest thing was, most of the people I've seen to say goodbye to are people I haven't said 'Hello' to in quite a while.  I know I haven't seen them much more than I will when I get to California, but it just seems so permanent.  My cousin, Danny, is having a dinner for me today, sometime after I actually go to sleep.  That will be the last of my goodbyes, I believe, and then Monday is all business.  I am so burned out, emotionally.  I'm trying not to even think about the trip.  I'm just going to go through the motions until I hit the west coast and then let all of this hit me like a bombshell.       Just in case people think I don't write on here very much, the truth is I have written some very long, thought out, and personal comments.  The problem is my computer cuts me off sometimes after, like, an hour of typing and I lose everything that I've poured out on the screen.  It's so emotionally discerning that I just say 'screw it' and give up.  But I promise to do better...maybe.  Perhaps not so much on the road, but a little bit.       Don't have much to say, so goodnight Chuck, Amanda, Mike and everyone else who's probably already asleep, so it's actually moot, but whatever.  *Your winning lottery numbers are: 10, 15, 23, 28, 40 & 43.  If you are one of the lucky winners, please come to the Forrest Hills crematorium for immediate disposal.  Thank you.*

        i stared this as a comment....it just got too long   i love you chuck, i know i don't always act like it but i do (please don't ever forget that last part). i can bearly see right now, i'm all teary-eyed (havenig just read your last post). it has been great haveing mike here to lean on, i couldn't do this without him, but i can't wait until you get here.  you're right, if we weren't a tight unit before, we will be now. we are eachother's best friends, we are very lucky. it's so hard to leave our families behind, and now, hopefully, we'll become eachother's family.  i love your optimism. that you say you're not worried, it feels right, you have faith. and you're right ,we couldn't be in better hands (we're in God's hands). i believe that everything happens for a reason and everything is happening just the ways it's suppoessed to (just the way he's planned).

       a minute apart  Crazy. Chuck's entry was "posted" at 1:09 AM [Detroit Time] and my entry was posted at 1:08 AM. Strange to think that him and I being 2,600 miles away decided to write at almost the exact same time. We must be made for eachother. Oh! Wait... what? I've said too much.

        you can always trust a cookie   I know the last post was mine, but it's been a very long day back in Michigan. The party just roared on. We had Aurora's birthday, hung out all day, and watched videos at night. Andrew took me out for chinese food and my fortune cookie read "You will conquer obstacles to achieve success." It seemed general, but it's still a welcome omen.  To tell you the truth, I'd been a little numb to the goodbye parties up until tonight. I've said goodbye to so many people at so many different times that it's like I've already left. It wasn't until tonight when Courtney got all teary-eyed on me that I realized the truth. I'm leaving my family for what might be a very long time. It's kind of scary. We spent a few hours watching old home movies of the parties we have and weddings and such... I spent so much time talking about what a tight crew we are, that I had forgotten what it was really like.   I have basically one day left. Tomorrow is cram packed with last minute goodbye and errands. Picking up my letter of reccomendation from Greg, saying goodbye to my parents, Jess & Andrew, hanging with Michelle one last time. My sister. I wish I could take them all with me. Actually, I just wish they had movie studios in every state. (I mean they might... well you know what I mean.)  If Billy, Mike, Amanda, and I weren't a tight unit before, you can bet we will be soon; because there isn't going to be anyone else to rely on. I'm not worried though. I don't think I could be in better hands. This just feels right. I know it's an unplanned, uncalculated risk, but it's right. I have faith. And for whatever it's worth, this might be my only chance. So I'm taking it.

       nothing worth doing is ever easy  Don't you [let me] forget it. Well so far there has been the expected ups and downs along with the occasional slaps in the face. But I remain optimistic... I believe in retrospect this will be a valuable test of patience and determination. But, you know what: I knew this would be hard... you knew this would be hard. Lets talk about something different.   I went for a swim the other day. You know when you eat too much ice cream, and the front of your brain starts to sting with a sharp cold numbing sensation? Well, diving in the second time was less  shocking  than the first, but my eyes were closed because I still had my contacts in, and so I was running my hand along the bottom to  feel  where I was at in the pool. It was starting to slope upwards and I knew I was almost to the opposite wall when my forehead began to feel considerably colder than the rest of my body.  Almost there ... then came the cold burn.  Any second ... the ice water rushed across my head harder as I kicked faster to reach the end sooner, it was almost unbearably freezing. I was ready to break any second. Then: Yes! The wall - I jumped out of the pool and clutched my forehead with both hands. Thank God the California sun was beaming down in the backyard, it was my only saving grace. Hmm... I was considering erasing this pointless story, but I'll leave it just because I can.  I have an interview Monday morning in Santa Monica for an internship at  urlLink Blackbox digital . I'm trying not to get my hopes up, actually - I probably shouldn't even be mentioning it just yet. Chances are: It won't be  that  easy. I need to be prepared to go through fifty interviews with no sign of luck. But there's always a chance I guess.  Well, I keep writing paragraphs of crap and then erasing them. So, I think I'm feeling a little too groggy to be writing an entry right about now. It must be past my bed time. "Till that day".  Actually before I sign off. I need to post this because I find it extremely funny, especially with all the republicans hard balling Kerry for being too " wish'y washy ".  urlLink I love facts like these... they are so easy to fotget . Enjoy.

        It's coming full circle   I went to workout with Courtney on Friday. I'm not sure why I went, since I can't exactly start a regular workout program here right now. I was the only guy in the class, even though she said there are usually more. At first the stuff they were doing was really easy. Some of it just looked silly (ex. jumping jacks). But after they really got rolling, I was getting my butt kicked.  A whole day later and I'm more sore then when I was in my car accident. I didn't tell Courtney, but I almost puked in the locker room. Housewives kick butt. The lady running it asked me if I had any comments at the end. I said "Yeah. If any of you are doing this because a guy told you that you could use it. Go home and punch him in the face."     Today is Aurora's 2nd birthday party (my cousin Jessica's baby). We're also having a going-away party for me afterwards, so hopefully there'll be some of that 3 ft sub left over. Today is my goal for getting all my stuff out of their place, which is mostly just my clothes and computer. Fortunately, both are packed away quite easily. Jessica and Andrew are awesome hosts if you ever get the opportunity. Not only did I live here for free, but they also feed me all the time. I'm grateful.  It's almost been two weeks since Mike and Amanda left and I can't believe it. The time has gone so quickly. But I really feel like I got everything done that I wanted to do. I saw all the people I wanted to see and got together all the things I needed to. I think this worked out really well, considering Amanda and Mike have been able to stay at her Uncle's for so long. I know it might have been awkward with the three of us there.  It looks like we'll be leaving Monday. I'm not sure if in the afternoon or morning or what. So if you've got anything to settle with me or Billy, I suggest you give us a call. Meantime, I'm going to go finish my laundry now. This might be the last time I ever do it for free.

       We're Going To Be Sleeping In a Bus Stop...         I must say I'm getting a bit worried about our future living situation.  I talk to Mike and Amanda everyday and it seems a bit discouraging.  I'm not worried about a place to sleep, my fantastic cousin, Crystal, is out there if I need her, but I will have to give my rental truck back, eventually.  I do have an interview for a transfer next Friday at the NoHo Target, so cross your fingers on that.  If I get it, that will be a lateral move, otherwise I will probably have to demote for now to stay with the company.  The last thing I want is to go somewhere else, especially when filling out applications for apartments.    Speaking of apartments, everyone ask Mike about how it's possible to get someone to raise the rent of an apartment you just finished looking at.  I just find it funnier than I do anything else.    I thought that work was going to be easier the closer I get to leaving, but they're working me harder this week than the last few months.  It's 2:00 a.m. right now.  I probably should be in bed for work already, but I just freakin' got out of work a little bit ago.  I'm too wired to sleep.  For those of you who want more pictures on here, I'm sorry I don't have a camera or a scanner, so I'll have to rely on Chuck's eagerness to that part.  I should be done packing in another day or so.  I've just worked some odd shifts and haven't had a lot of huge blocks to do anything, except for when I'm being lazy.  Anyway, five more days and then we're on the road.  Punch me in the face and black my eye!  That sure is soon!  I should probably go ahead and exchange most of my Michigan currency for California currency before I get out there.  I hear there is a lower exchange rate there.  It's good to stay ahead of the game.    Well, I'm going to try and get some sleep before morning comes.  Everyone take care and if you dream of me, remember, whatever I did in the dream doesn't count against me in real life.  Until next time...

       mama said there'd be days like this  "Ugh..."  Breaking news: we were turned down for an apartment in NoHo [North Hollywood]. It was our first. I could just scream: " I have money... lots of it... take it! Now "! But, I don't suppose that would do much else besides scare away the landlords. I dropped off more applications for another apartment just a few feet away from the place mentioned above - Billy and Chuck still have to fax in their info, before the lady will even look at us. So, since that is anything but promising, I have been calling every apartment in the area, and time is running out fast. Only seven more days... maybe eight. It's getting down to the wire. I did however have one pleasant conversation on the phone with a landlord today - a nice guy named Ted, another place over by NoHo. Anyways, enough my running in circles.  Amanda is at work right now, she got a job at a snoody clothing store for 30'somethings in the mall, a place called  urlLink j.jill ... she hates it though, her boss is a real power hungry snob, who after walking Amanda around the store for an hour, showing her which [overpriced] cloths she should buy to: "look the part", told Amanda that if she had interviewed her first; she wouldn't have hired her. Even though she kinda' did interview her first, but that's besides the point.   I had an interview at Kinko's yesterday for an opening during the graveyard shift, but that didn't go so well. To explain: Amanda's interview was at 2 pm, I dropped off a resume and was asked to come in at 3:30 pm. So these two interviews are less then 10 minutes down the street from each other, the thought that an hour and a half wasn't enough time never even crossed our minds. But the [ expletive deleted ] interviewing Amanda had to take her shopping for an hour and screwed it all up. I was hoping Amanda would walk any second, Amanda hoped I had already left, I didn't know the number or the street name it was on. And you get the idea: I showed up late. They weren't impressed. I'm still unemployed.   But, I have an interview tomorrow afternoon at  urlLink Nielsen Entertainment , thanks to Tricia (whom we're staying with at the moment), she works there doing box office research [among other things]. She has been helping out a lot... a lot, a lot. Yesterday she came home with a job list for interns, one of those "underground list (you can only get if you know someone who knows someone)". So that of course is: 'crap-my-pants exciting'. Then ontop of this favor, she helped my write a resume last night, along with a cover letter that she assured me looked great [she said she reads thousands of them]. So I spent a while last night emailing my cover letter & resume to people on the list, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

        Billy's packing. Mark & Linette gave me money.      Mark and Linette have paid [undisclosed amount] for the exclusive rights to the story of my California trip. I'm honored to be the first recipient of the  urlLink Crimewave  Art & Culture grant, though I believe the best possible use of the money will have nothing to do with either. Mark also paid for dinner, which was very nice, and very expensive. The guilt will be enough to write a fabulous article.     Billy is still working on packing up his stuff. All those white boxes are just comic books. He still has a crapload of stuff in his room, and just 5 days to get the rest of it into corrugated cardboard. I'm not too concerned though. I'm sure he'll get it done in time. He said most of his packing has to be done by himself, so I can't really help him with anything at this point.   What happened to everybody? Am I the only one posting on this website anymore? We're not going to be able to hold our audience for much longer. I'm adding one more picture to this several picture post. Joe's parents gave me a hundred bucks for the trip. They were extremely generous, so here's a nice picture of me with them. I'm sending them a thank you note from California when I get there.     Everyone, please keep reading and I promise I'll kick everyone in the butt for not posting for so long. If any more problems come up, I can deal with them in a timely fashion. I forgot, my boss gave me fifty bucks too, but I don't have a picture of him.

        My erstwhile co-workers...   Well, everyone at work decided to have a going-away party for me this Sunday. For some reason, I was sort of dreading it. I wanted to go, but I haven't really known them all for very long, and I didn't want it to be some big phony awkward scene. But I went anyway and man... it was crazy.  From what I remember, we did something like 6 shots. Which ended up being 10 for me, since Maureen made me drink the last two of hers. Bridgette got me an 8x10 photograph of myself in a frame that everyone signed. My boss gave me fifty bucks, a box of condoms, sunscreen, and an inhaler. Then he gave me a hug that lasted a minute while he told me how much he'd appreciated working with me and how he knew I was going to be successfull. He wrote it on the picture frame too.  I had to crash at Maureen's place, because I didn't want to drive anywhere. I couldn't go to sleep because the 10 shots were Jager-bombs (pronounced Yay-ger), which is a can of Red Bull mixed with a shot of Jagermeister. You get drunk and hung over, but the Red Bull keeps you awake for half the night. I woke up on the couch with my fists clenched over my belt. I had terrible nightmares about falling and my car not working.  Needless to say, this will be my last indulgence of alcoholic beverages. At least until my wedding. Suprisingly, I didn't wake up with a hangover, so I walked back to Zoup (since Maureen had split for work) and got a ride back to my car from my boss.   All this from people I've known for just three months. It's amazing how beer brings people together, (even when they don't really want to be.) I've always had a lot of respect for Mike for not drinking occassionally, like the rest of us. But I think it's easier to understand why this is something people do so much, if you drop yourself in every once in a while.  Work is done now, and all I have left to do is say goodbye to a few more friends and take care of just a couple more things. I have it all written down on a calendar to remind myself. After that it'll be coming up with enough money to make it. If we get this place Mike and Amanda found, it shouldn't be hard to come up with next month's rent. So I should have a little while to find a job.

        just a quick note   Mike already fell asleep and I need to join him, cause we have to get up early in the morning. I just wanted to thank a few people, for without whom this move would not have been possible.  Thank you to my Mom and Ray for your financial help and your promise that I will always have a place in your house to call "home".  Thank you to my Dad and Badria for you financial help and for your incredible encouragement.  Thank you to my Uncle Thurman and Tricia for opening your home to us and going out of your way to help us find an apartment.   I also noticed that we forgot to mention the caliblog stickers. We put them up in just about every restroom we visited and a few other places too. However, we must've over estimated our bladder control because we ran out somewhere in NM. If anyone has reached this site due to seeing one of our stickers, please leave a comment and let us know.  That would be cool.

       Deep breath:  Got introduced to everyone at a bar in Hollywood. Finally met  urlLink dennis  face to face. Saturday we hiked up to the Hollywood sign with Amanda's Godfather. My shins still are recovering. We ate at a great little restaruant and saw  urlLink the fat kid  from "The Sandlot". Drove around NoHo and Studio City for hours. Called twenty apartments from their front lawns hoping to get a tour. No luck there. Tried to buy a Thomas Guild at several different places. No luck again. Apple wasn't currently hiring. Went to the mall for applications. Amanda picked up fourteen... I got two. Walked past  urlLink Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Jr.  sitting infront of the escalator. Watched Moulin Rouge with "Thurman" and Tricia. Ate shrimp for the first time... ate some more. Talked movies after dinner by the pool.   "Gasp'   And thats just the half of it. I'm so exhausted. But it's not over with yet. Tomorrow morning we are turning in our apartment applications and hoping for the best.   Billy sugested we bring the landlady some cookies because they're "straight from the heart".   Then we are going to (hopefully) open bank accounts here. Then I have to go into Kinko's to talk to Kim. Both of us need to call Nielson to set up interviews. Drop by Bed, Bath & Beyond... Pet-co...Staples... and who knows what else. Look up theaters in the surrounding area and see who's looking for help.   But on a lighter note: Amanda and I decided to take a short break, and actually enjoy the best thing California has to offer: the beach. I know it's snowing in Michigan, but it was 70  plus  today. We walked barefoot in the sand at the spot where the ocean washes over your feet (I missed that). Spent eleven dollars on a hot dog and two drinks. And drove ten minutes in the wrong direction on the 101. Actually I believe its the first time we have messed up on directions since leaving Michigan.   I tried to call you Mandy, but you had already gone to bed. Sorry. I told Mom to have you call Amanda's cell when you get home from school and we can finally talk... I miss you very much. And that goes for you too, Nick, Dad & Mom. I will be calling soon (hopefully during some point in between our mad dash of erands).

       overdue  I know, I know... I've been here for days now, and haven't posted more than a paragraph, I'm sorry... and I will attempt now to do some catching up. Where to begin: We've been out all day long (again). We starting this morning by helping Amanda's, Uncle Thurman, and Tricia [his wife] clean out their Hagen-Dazs shop out in Santa Monica. They donated all the left over tubs of ice cream (fourteen plus in total) to a homeless shelter. Then Amanda and I dropped by [unannounced] Sarah G.'s apartment... but she wasn't around... great neighborhood though ("... right near the beach, boey !").  Then we [Amanda and I] started calling every apartment we could find, setting up visits and asking all kinds of questions. But, aparently not too many landlords stop by the office on a Saturday evening. So we only got to check out one place, but, that one place was very promising:  Roomy enough, nice neighborhood, close enough to downtown Hollywood, and best of all - in our price rang .  Actually: you know what, people... I lied - this is going to be a terrible attempt at "catching up", because they are out there cooking diner and it's calling my name. So, as for the rest of the story, you'll have to wait :)

       "Gas is more expensive because crude oil is more expensive." Thanks. That explains a lot.   Who's to decide what's good and bad?   I won the Crimewave grant! Wahoo! I sent a proposal over to Mark Maynard and he called me a lazy bastard and said I won. So I guess maybe I was just a favorite from the beginning. I drew a really cool schematic using only characters on the keyboard, but apparently that wasn't good enough. Anyway, I'm going to use my newly found grant money to pay for gas. Which, by the way, I can't stop hearing about on TV. The national average is now like $1.70. It's over $2 in California.  Mike called me from L.A. He said the weather is perfect and everyone is being really positive. They have a huge list of places to check out. He said we might even be renting a house instead of an apartment, which would be awesome. We're going to be just like a sitcom. Consequently, I'm holding a competition to see who can come up with the best name for a sitcom with Mike, Amanda, Billy, and me. The winner gets a special prize. You can put your submissions in the comment thing. (I promise the prize doesn't suck.)  Everyone at work is throwing me a going-away party. Bridgette posted a sign at work that said "Chuck's going to LA, So we're having a going-away party!" I'm going to marker over the sign to make it say "a go-away party". Greg is even putting the tab on the store, so everyone can drink for free. And all I did was put in my two weeks...   My car gets lighter each day as I decide more and more things to leave behind. I'm still amazed at how not packed Billy is. His apartment looks exactly the same. I went over tonight to help him pack and he put one statue in a box. Then he sat on the couch and watched friends. "This could take a while...", Chuck thought. We've also decided to maybe leave on the 14th, instead of the 15th.  I made a list yesterday of things I had to take care of. My bank says I can close my account from LA, if I just send them a letter with all this info and they'll send me a cashier's check. I'm glad I thought to check on that. I made a little calendar too with my last week and a half planned out. I've got three parties and about 4 people to see separately. Only two days of work left!  Additionally, if anyone out there reading this owes me money, I have to collect now. No? Alright, well just checking.

        Thursday, March 4, 2003 They made it look easy...        Well, Mike and Amanda have made it to California, and they couldn't be happier.  I only talked to them for a second, but they have a lot of plans to get ready for our coming.  Hopefully we'll be able to get a fairly reasonable place, which I'm sure Michael will talk about when he writes very soon.  My cousin, Crystal, called me today.  She's pretty excited about me coming out.  She said I could actually stay with her until we get settled, if I need to.  I thought that was sweet of her, but she's always been one of my favorites, anyway.  It will be nice to actually know someone who lives out there, so that's something to look forward to.       My friend, James, e-mailed the other day warning me that California wasn't everything he had expected.  He gave me a bit of forewarning.  He had just gotten back from there that morning.  He has a movie he's going to be releasing sometime this year titled 'Ritual Season', I believe.  He's really into the horror genre.  Keep your eyes opened for it.  I can't wait, myself.  He's a pretty cool cat.  I really miss his company.  So, you hear that Mike and Amanda...watch out!  California is a shifty place.  Don't lose my money or I'll throttle you with my bare feet!         Chuck just left a few minutes ago.  I get the feeling he and his girl are not prepared for his departure.  I think they're trying to soak in as much time together as possible and tear apart at the last possible second.  That's cool and all, I mean, from the time I've spent with her, she's really cool, definitely a keeper.  I'm just really worried about both of them when it finally comes to the last second.  I just hate the idea of how much this going to hurt each of them.  They seem so happy that it's almost bittersweet.  I'm really happy for Chuck, but I know what's coming around the corner.  Just be careful, guys-and be ready.  It's really, really close.       I went into work today and they had the new schedule up, and under my name it was just 7 'U's (for unavailable).  It was a little surreal.  It's right there in front of me and it still isn't completely sinking in.  My cold feet are freezing up.  I feel like I'm going to have an anxiety attack when it finally hits me really good.  My heart's already beating a little fast just thinking about it.  Don't worry, there's no backing down, but WHOA!  What the heck am I doing?       Before I go, I just want to say how great Mike's family is.  They are so supportive...of all of us.  I just wanted to say a quick 'thanks' to all of them:  Tim, Deb, Nick, and Mandy.  Mike's a very lucky guy.       Until next time...

        where I left off  I had a few more things to say before the prudes at the last library cut me off (even though they had more empty computers and we were the only people there). Doesn't matter..... Tucumcari is a ghetto place anyways.  I wanted to tell my pot hole story....  It was close to 1am and we were trying to get to my cousin's before we fell asleep. We got off the exit ramp and were driving slow down the dark streets looking for her street sign when I hit the biggest pot hole in the world, my car stalled and I pulled it over down a side street (this area of town was a bit creepy) I knew right away what had happened. My gas cut off switch had been triggered. I had to empty out most of my very packed trunk to find the button and push it back in it only took a minute, and we were back on the road. I guess that's a pretty boring story but I only mention it because if I had not had that exact thing happen to me with my first car, in high school I wouldn't have had any idea what it was and surely would've freaked (Mike knows zip about cars so he wouldn't have been able to help) but I didn't .... I was proud... I felt experienced or something.  So I wanted to say thanks to my cousin, Michelle for making us a nice bed and letting us spend the night in her nice house. I'm sorry we got there so late and we didn't have time to visit like I'd hoped. Congratulations on your engagement. I love you!   P.S. Bonnie, will you please take a picture of Millie's puppies and email it to me or something, I know they are probably so cute! Man, do I wish so bad I could have one..... I miss having a pooch :)

       kingman, AZ  Arizona is amazingly beautiful. We decided to skip the grand canyon due to snow [it has been snowing since New Mexico], and have been making great time across the desert.   We stopped off here in Kingman to fill up on gas (at 1.99 a gallon... don't worry Chuck, and Billy. That's the most expensive its been... by a lot) and grab something quick to eat. We figured since we skipped driving up to the grand canyon we are half a day ahead of schedule and wanted to catch up here on the blog.   Everything has been going great. The drive has been a little on the lonely side, but thanks to my Dad lending us a pair of (awesome) walkie talkies, it's been tolerable. I can't wait to see Vegas, I can't wait to shower either. We won't be gambling, but it will be nice to have some time to spend with eachother for once on this drive.  We should be in Hollywood by 7 pm tomorrow. I'm gonna give Amanda a chance to post now (plus: I have to blow my nose). This post is boring (says Amanda) but I'm under pressure to keep it quick.

        Public Library Tucumcari, NM 11:45am  Well I only have about 15 minutes until I have to give the computer up. The connection is so slow so it might not be long enough, it took 5 min already just to check my email. I just made a comment on Billy's last entry from the visitor information center about 45 min ago, then I got so excited and so happy to be in NM that I blasted "one more time" by Daft Punk (it's a 13 min song and I listened to it twice) and danced all the way here. Finding the library was a bit tricky but we made it (Mike had to go #2 so we were in a hurry :) hee hee).    The trip hasn't been too bad so far, actually today has been great. We woke up at sunrise in Mike's car parked at the super 8 motel in Elk City, TX. Yesterday when we left my cousin's in Kansas City, we hit the worst wind I've ever driven in all the way through Kansas, the bikes were catching wind all over the place, it was crazy. Eventually Mike figured out a better way to secure them and they haven't moved an inch since. Then we took a nap at a rest stop and when we woke up the wind had passed.  I talked to my Uncle Thurman on the phone at a gas station in Witchita, Kansas yesterday. He is anxiously awaiting our arrival, I think. He said he now has a whole list of places for us to check out when we get there, he and Tricia (his wife) have been so incredibly helpful, they are awesome. Really I think my uncle just doesn't want us to be there for ever. So we shouldn't have any trouble finding a place before Chuck and Billy get there.  time to go... ahhh!!!

       ...and then there were two.     Well, Mike and Amanda left out on their trip yesterday morning.  I know I'm going to see them again in a couple of weeks, but It was kind of sad.  Plus, there is no promise that any of us will make it out there in one peice.  Not that I think anything will happen, but you never know.  I hope you guys are having fun, if you get this message.    With the two of them leaving it really gets the ball rolling with a resounding 'BANG', doesn't it.  There really is no turning back now.  That's fine, just a bit scary.  We're in it together, though, so at least we have each other (wherest thou goeth...and all that jazz).   I tried to leave a message yesterday (Sunday), but, as I'm sure some of you know, the site was down most of the day.  Today I reserved my truck for the trip.  I was able to get a fair deal, which is good, but still expensive.  My projected date to leave is the 15th of March.  Hopefully that is cool with Chuck, but I don't know, because his phone is not working (So call me, Chuckles, if you read this.)  Well, this is just a quick update and a 'Howdy', so until next time, be good...and Mike and Amanda, be safe!

       mike maddox ate my brain  Today I get an email mixed in with the massive amounts of spam yahoo lets through on a regular basis from Mike Maddox, who is Mike Maddox? I couldn't  really  tell you...   I do know he went to my school; I do know he was in the same grade as me; and I do remember that when I was in elementary - he used to try to convince me that we were best friends because both our names were 'Mike'.   Anyways, I get an email from him that he sent out to everyone in his address book, and all the email has is a link. No explination, no attachment, nothing. Due to curiosity I didn't just delete it and it took me  urlLink here . What this is, I do not know, but I do know one more thing about Mike Maddox; he's a wierdo'.

       day at the aquarium  I had a feeling there might be a few schools going to the aquarium yesterday. As we were walking inside, about 10 buses emptied out onto the courtyard, spilling row after row of children, wearing name tags or homemade t-shirts to identify themselves. They were organized in lines against nearly every wall or outcropping their parents and teachers could find.   Fortunately, they all had short attention spans and if you waited behind them a minute or two, they'd run off to the next exhibit, giving you a few minutes to check out the sea life before the next swarm ran over your feet. I feel like an old man for saying it, but sometimes it was like they really weren't looking where they were going. I can't tell you how many kids took a header into Michelle's side because they were running straight, looking left, and yelling at their friends behind them.  All that aside, the aquarium was awesome. It was two stories tall with plenty of helpful people and exhibits. I forgot to turn off the camera's flash at first, so here are the pictures that came out ok. At least from the digital camera.      A scuba guy dove in to feed the fish. He waved at all the little kids. I was going to flip him off, but Michelle wouldn't have let me.     Another picture of the tank. That's real sunlight through the roof.

       like peas in a pod...  I thought I would write a quick post while Michelle is drying her hair. We're getting ready to go an aquarium in Long Beach called  urlLink the Aquarium of the Pacific.  You get to pet sharks and stuff, so it sounds pretty cool. It's going to be about an hour drive in traffic though. We're already a little pink from our last day driving.  We had a blast yesterday. I took her to the Santa Monica pier to listen to the street acts and stuff. There was a farmer's market right next to the 3rd Street Promenade. We walked through all these rows of fruits and veggies and hari krishnas and fat jamaican guys in overalls selling [and I quote] "Lavender lotion... the love potion." Michelle wouldn't take any of the free samples, so I stole her a cherry.   Earlier in the day, we were walking on a really smooth brick sidewalk and someone had spilled a shake on it. A TV crew was filming this homeless guy with a sign that said "A smile will be fine." I walked right in between them and slipped on the shake in my sandals. If I hadn't been holding Michelle's hand, I'd have taken a dive. Of course, she dies laughing at me, and apparently the homeless guy was in tears. And the TV crew has it all on tape of course. [lucky me. They'll be watching that outtake for years]  After that we went to Citywalk (a mall at Universal Studios), just to look at the stores and get some lunch. A lady mentioned they were shooting something for American Idol and we saw where the set-up had been, so Michelle said we should go look for celebrities. So we walk where we can't see any people, between two building, and none other than  urlLink Simon Cowell  strolls right next to us, going the other direction, bodyguards in tow. Michelle actually didn't recognize him, so for those of you that don't know, he's the judge from American Idol. [I'm only kidding, everyone knows that.] She recognized him after he walked in front of a poster of himself, to chat with some Japanese tourists. He actually was pretty nice to them.  After that we took a drive to Pasadena to see the movie  urlLink Touching the Void , which was incredible. It's a documentary [basically] about these two climbers going up this impossible mountain. It's really really good, so go see it, if it's showing anywhere near you. Pasadena was gorgeous. They had all this architecture and mountains. The drive home with all the lights all up and down the sides of the mountains was breathtaking. I wish everyone hadn't been going 70mph, or we might have had a longer time to see it.  Everywhere that we went yesterday, Michelle knew how to get there and I didn't. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she'd lived here before. She'd been to Santa Monica once, and remembered it. I've been there three times and I didn't even know what highway to start from. She has quite the sense of direction, and boy did I hear about it.   That was pretty much the whole day. The best part of this week is that we seem to be using each day to it's full potential. I didn't even really have the time to write yesterday. It's going to stink when she leaves Friday, but she'll be back next week, and we've got even more stuff planned. Plus I'll actually have some money this time. I'm thinking Universal Studios, probably.   Well, she's done with her beautifying, so we're outta here. Time to brave the 101 and get some breakfast. Later days!

       the [other] girl has landed  I found out yesterday that it was snowing in Michigan. Meanwhile, we were roasting. The valley was about 100 degrees yesterday. I took Michelle to the mall and all the local places, since we were supposed to go to a tv show taping yesterday with Billy. I wanted to get back by 5:30.  I took her up Mullholand drive, which curves along a mountainside, to get a better look at the city. Then we went to Burbank and the mall and Ikea and stuff. Mike and Amanda went with us to Santa Monica later on. We had chinese and went to the beach. The ocean made Santa Monica about 10 degrees cooler, so then the weather was perfect.  Last night we tried to sit around the house to chill out a little, but the heat was almost unbearable. I kept passing out on the couch, so Michelle watched my Futurama DVD a little. Finally, Mike and Amanda came out of their room and we all drove to the store to cool off. We debated going to the S. Monica again, cause they let everyone sleep on the beach, but everyone just passed out. Our air conditioner is broken. Billy checked it this morning and it's covered in frost.   So big plans for today. We're going to the beach again, only this time were going alone and taking a picnic or something. It's still too cold to swim, but the cool breeze under the sun is... well, perfect.  I'm elated. I'm glad she's here. I haven't felt this centered in a long time. I wish she didn't have to go back.   Here's the  urlLink video of us picking Michelle up at LAX.   Also, her mom bought me a frisbee and attached this to it. It's terrifying, I think, but I guess it's the thought that counts.

       A2 is in tha house!  This week's movie of us walking around Ann Arbor really makes me miss it. If you happen to be from the Ann Arbor area, you may recognize a few things if you look closely or slow it down a bit. That was a fun night. I really think Mike did a great job making the video interesting, every time I watch it I see something new.

       almost forgot  I updated the  urlLink weekly movie  [I know, I know... it's a few days late] last night. I was suppose to import some footage and re-cut a short Chuck and I helped a friend film in Ann Arbor two years ago, but I never got to it with all the other editing I've been doing [you can expect to see it sometime in the future].   So, anyways; the new weekly movie: which is a little hard to watch; [is of the three of us; Chuck, Amanda and I] we took the camera out with us while we went for one of our many midnight walks around downtown Ann Arbor... and then we sped up an hour of footage into a two minute music video. It looks great at full resolution, but that would be far too big of a file to put on our server [maybe... hmm... I might try it now... I think we actually have the bandwidth for it now], but this clip is more like a sixth of the normal resolution and the frames [since they're interlaced] kinda bleed together. I like to watch it frame by frame because its like going through a slideshow. Either way you watch it, I hope you enjoy it and I hope it doesn't give you a head ache. We are working on something to put up for next week... we'll see if we come through.

       random video  I might have mentioned the other night Chuck, Amanda and I went out filming around Universal and downtown Hollywood by the Kodak Theater. Well... most of it will never see the light of day cause we were just out goofing around and it's obvious. But here are a few random clips from the night that are watch-able.      Above:  urlLink Chuck giving Amanda a piggy back ride  outside the famous Mann's Theater. Which actually isn't the "Mann's" anymore - I guess it went bankrupt and is now owned by someone else... how does the most popular theater in the world go bankrupt? Strange.   I'm just gonna post these with as little explanation as possible [due to there's nothing really to explain; we were just running around with the camera].  urlLink This second clip  is Amanda loosing Chuck at Universal and "somehow" ending up out side of the Metro downtown... if you thought about were she lost him and where she ended up looking for him... and you knew the area, it would make very little sense.  I realized after watching this clip that the image is so small and dark is might be very difficult to tell what's going on: Chuck is hiding behind a trash can, then Amanda runs out in-front of the water fall, and when the coast is clear Chuck makes a break for it .  And now  urlLink we are somewhere  inside the Kodak theater [we would later get busted by the security guards for filming without a permit], there's no sound to this because the whole short 'chase' video was suppose to have music laid behind it, but I decided I'm lazy.  And finally;  urlLink my favorite shot  of the night, it was an accident but I like the way it looks. Don't worry Amanda doesn't actually palm the camera lens... I just made it look that way. For those of you wondering where this is at, we are down in the subway off Lankershim Blvd.

       She's here.  We picked up Michelle from LAX last night, just before I had to go to work. My boss let me off early, cause I told him she was coming down to see me, so I'm out now. It's almost 3 though, and I really need to go to bed. So I just wanted to let her parents and everyone know she's in good hands. Tomorrow is going to be a blast. Night, all.

       and then there were five  Michelle flew into LAX about two hours ago, and Chuck left for work an hour ago. I can imagine that must suck for the both of them, Chuck said he is praying for it to be dead like it has been the past few nights and that he will be let off early considering there are more people scheduled than normal.  Before we drove into LAX we [Chuck, Amanda, and myself] stopped by the Temple Bar where the  urlLink ifp  plays independent films every month for free. The first film was crap - crap from the first shot. I'm not even going to bother going into it. But the second short, called "small change" was really good actually. If anything the first short [which was an incredibly long 25 minutes] was a confidence booster, it's defiantly something look forward to [getting a short played there that is].  Its been so hot inside the apartment today, sticky hot, the kind of heat where the back of your knees sweat while you're sitting. We've been cranking the a/c all day long but it never seems to get farther than the living room. So, needless to say, both the bedrooms are slow roasting ovens.

       wasted  I watched a short film titled, " urlLink Marla " [as in Marla from fight club] by a film group called " urlLink Another State of Mind ". I am jealous; envious; bitter; and very impressed by their work. I can feel the pressure building inside - the little things building one on-top of the other - another wasted day. Another unfinished project. Another idea shot down. I just want to film fucking anything! I apologize for the swearing but I needed that. Every idea or project I suggest it is shot to pieces or brushed off with a general compliment. Not enough story, not enough character development, too little action, too little dialogue, too anything... it never matters what. Marla is a great short, well shot, creative, original [in a strange sort of way] and guess what; lacks story; lacks character development; action; lots of things. But surprise, surprise: it's very interesting, and very well done. And from the looks of the behind the scenes bonus materials; it looked like it was a lot of fun to film. Ugg... I should be out doing filming right now, by myself if I have to, but as much as I want to film "anything" I don't want it to be nothing. Life is passing by... time is passing by... opportunities... chances... ideas... and I'm well aware of it. When am I going to react?

       P.A. in L.A.  The last couple of days at work have been really slow. I go in around 11 o'clock, we print a few copies off, and by midnight the place is pretty much dead. There are a few regulars that use the computers all night, but they pretty much leave everyone alone. I know it sounds cool, cause I get to sit around and get paid to surf the web, but trust me. It's boring. But I know it's one of those things that when I'm somewhere else, I'm really going to miss getting paid for nothing.  Yesterday my boss told me she was a PA [production assistant] for all kinds of places in Hollywood. She can't work anymore though, because she lost her car. She's getting a new car pretty soon though, and she said as soon as she was working again she could recommend me and get me a job as a PA. Apparently they get paid twice as much as we do now, and all you have to do is drive around and help out on sets and stuff. It'd be awesome just to be working near actual real shoots. I told her to sign me up.   She also gave me the names of some websites I'm looking into that are hiring for Hollywood type jobs. I just need to type myself up a new resume to send out to these guys and get my suit laundered. This Friday will be the first time in a long time since I've actually had some money to spend. I'm still down to thirty bucks, and all of that's getting spent on Michelle. She leaves the day I get paid, and comes back 5 days later. I can't wait to show her around California. I wish she could have been with us yesterday when we went to Venice Beach. It was so beautiful.  I made up some business cards for mike today. I know he's going to freak out when he gets them. He's been putting stickers up all over the place, but I think this would be a bit classier. It's actually really cool. It's just a plain white business card with caliblog.com typed in the center. It's like one of those cards they hand out in movies. I want a version that says "go west" too, but I'm going to see what everyone thinks of these. I can't wait to hand one to a celebrity. [and don't think I won't].  Hearing Michelle's voice on the phone yesterday flipped me out. I can't wait for her to get here. I'll try to keep posting, even though we'll be hanging out all day. Maybe now I'll have something to write about again. First place I'm taking her is to a taping of a TV show with the Indian guy from Van Wilder. You know the one who says "I want to take it to the car wash! You know. Get it waxed!". It's going to be directed by David Schwimmer from Friends, so he'll be there too.   Billy's been talking about taking a warehouse job in the mornings so he can try and get into a theatre troupe around here. I couldn't agree more. Billy was born to be in front of people. He has way too many quips to be wasted on me all day. Speaking of being wasted all day... Just kidding. I just wanted to say it twice.  My car is running like a big piece of crap and I got a letter in the mail today that says my insurance is cancelled. I was trying to ride my bike to work, but the stem is too long and my arms are overextended across the frame. It adds stress on my already bad knee and I can't ride without feeling sore. So soon as I get some cash I gotta buy a new stem. And a bed. And some work shoes. And food. And gas.... [what was I talking about?]  First we all complained that it was only our families that commented, and now everyone's pissed that our families don't comment anymore. Or at least not as much. We just love the attention. Amanda's post was written deliberately to get nice comments and it did not have the desired effect. I'm pretty easy to please, so just knowing it's out there makes me happy. I know those 550 unique visitors to the site are at least SOME people not related to us. So, to the unknown audience, I salute you. Now, comment, You spineless turds!  To my family and friends, I miss you all, but with every passing day I feel closer and closer to California. My new home is growing on me. I can't say I don't' occasionally long for what is familiar, whether it's better or worse, but I can say I'm enjoying what's new.

       there's beauty in the breakdown  Will we ever learn? Once again we go out  cameraless  and end up kicking ourselves the whole time.  Since it was so beautiful [and incredibly hot] today, we drove out the beach; the whole time Chuck, Amanda and I were walking around Venice, with every apartment we passed we wanted more and more to live there. To have a small little balcony overlooking the boardwalk - watching the sun sink behind the ocean every night. The apartments may be smaller, but I don't even know what to do with half the space I have here. Venice Beach and Santa Monica are like Ypsi and Ann Arbor, the more I visit the two the more I think I'm willing to make the move. Hell, the internship I interviewed for was in Santa Monica... I don't have to live in downtown Hollywood to be 'where it's at'. Not to mention Venice phone numbers begin with 358. Which happens to be Chuck's long time lucky / un-lucky number. The reason it's either or is because he hasn't been able to figure it out yet; the number seems to connect itself to good and bad experiences.  Crap! I just realized today is the beginning of a new "weekly movie". I have two and half hours left to upload something new, this weeks short didn't do as well as our first run. Last I checked it only had hit 55 downloads when the 'Great Tower' was in the near 80s. Ahh, you win some you lose some. Actually;  urlLink here's a little something  my brother sent me the other day, a short 30 second commercial for Onsted schools. I miss him, I miss my sister - I miss my family... this video defiantly brings those feelings to the surface. I am looking forward to visiting home for my bro's graduation, but unfortunately he won't be having an open house until he returns from Kenya [my brother is like Indiana Jones... he goes to exotic country's left and right].  Chuck the other night, while looking up who knows what, stumbled across a  urlLink project called "loft cube" . I want one. They build this special "loft" and fly it in on a helicopter, dropping it on a rooftop. It's crazy, and I want one really, really bad. If I could have one of these on a rooftop not far from the ocean; I would be  materialisticly  complete for the rest of my days. Okay, that's a lie - I would still crave a number of  urlLink apple  computers and toys [G5; iPod; Cinema display; maybe an iBook].   I got hired in at  urlLink Ikea  today, so now I am juggling two jobs... we'll see how long that last. I am plotting on starting up the video production work I did back in Ypsi out here, considering there are  urlLink over twenty theaters with-in No Ho alone , I should be able to nab one repeat project. Plus I just can't stand to work for someone, I became spoiled back home with working my own hours and getting to cut video for a living. But whether I make more money or not doing it here - hell, I'll film theater productions and cut 'em up for the same 8 bucks an hour I make at toys 'r' us - I don't need to make a killing out here. The free time alone is worth the responsibility... out here I could use all the free time I can get for writing / filming / editing / living a life that will make me happy / enjoying the weather / you get the idea.

       "Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating."  I just got back from work a little while ago. I should've crawled back into bed with mike, like he asked, but everyone is asleep and I felt really inspired on my way home, so I think I'll take advantage of this opportunity.  I only worked for 3.5 hours this morning. I have to get a second job. This is the second day in a row that I've been sent home early due to cutting back on hours. And I only had 22 hours this week to begin with. I hope Mike doesn't leave Toys R Us for Ikea. He could get benefits from Toys R Us, too and he could actually do both, since Toys R Us is just a few hours in the morning anyway. If Ikea hired me, I think I'd do both. If Best buy hires me, I will.   When I got up at 5 am to get ready for work, Mike was still up. I'm not sure what he and Chuck were doing, but Chuck is always up at that time (due to the overnight schedule and all). So that explains why Mike is still asleep. They'll all be getting up around noon or so anyway. At 1 pm we're all leaving to go see a run through of the "Joey" show's rehearsal.  On my way home from work some old lady cut me off really bad, then 2 seconds later I saw a cop run a light right when it turned red.  I'm going to post a few pictures of myself.      This is what I looked like when Mike saw me for the first time, my hair was in braids and he thought it was hot. I'm looking at my hand through a magnifying glass that I found in Chuck's room.   I was going to talk a little bit about myself for the folks out there who don't know me, in a shameless attempt to make myself more popular on this blog, but I can't remember what I wanted to say. I guess my feelings are just a bit hurt that no one ever leaves [positive] comments on my posts. I know "it's not a popularity contest"...blah blah blah... And I suppose it does make sense, since the only people to comment are usually Mike's family, Billy's "girlfriends" and occasionally, Chuck's dad.   I've been really obsessed with this song lately, by 'The Postal Service' called ' urlLink Such Great Heights '. I especially love the  urlLink lyrics . I also really like the song from the 'Garden State' trailer called  urlLink 'Let Go' by 'Frou Frou' .  If you're ever bored and have a minute, scroll down to my links and check out 'Voice Yourself'. It's a very cool sight. Click on "Thoughts from within" and watch the video. Maybe it will inspire you. Another really great thing I found from that sight was  urlLink this page  on industrial hemp facts. The first time Mike and I read it, we were blown away. I know it's a bit long, but if you just skim through it I'm sure you'll find tons of interesting information. Hey..... it might even change the way you live...... that makes it worth mentioning for me.  I got really homesick earlier this week. Not all that homesick for Michigan, just homesick for some friends.  My only friend out here is Sara G. who lives in Santa Monica. She moved out here 2 months before me. For some reason we haven't managed to hook up yet. And, yes, I do realize that I live with 3 friends, but sometimes a girl just needs someone to talk to who isn't one of her boyfriends best friends. I miss my girls back home. And my mom and Emily. Some of the time I really feel like I have no friends here, like I have my Boyfriend and he has his friends, and I'm all alone.      This is my dog, Shy. He passed away last Thanksgiving, I've been missing him a lot lately, too. I got him on St Patrick's day, when I was 21 and he was 8 weeks. I raised him... he was my baby.   I had kind of a hard beginning of the week..... and last week... hell, I've been moody. It's been hard. Maybe it's just hormones. I'm obviously still adjusting. Living life here in CA isn't much different than living life anywhere else, it's the moving away from home and moving in with 3 guys that I'm not adjusted to yet. Mike and I haven't really found where our relationship fits into all of this yet, either. But I'm sure it's going to work out eventually. And I am grateful to have all 3 of them here. It's true. I am.     This is Mike and I in Oct. 2002, we had only been dating for a couple of months.   Michelle is coming next week. That will be fun. At least there will be another girl here to hang with. My step-sister, Amber just got accepted to the California Institute of the Arts, in the Film Direction Program. She'll be moving here in the fall. I'm so excited! And she's coming to visit in July, I think. My best friend, Crystal is also coming to visit sometime in May or June. And my mom and Ray will be stopping for a day on their way to visit my godmother in New Zealand, at the end of May.     This is my stepsister, Amber, and her man, Alex. Taken the same day as that last one of Mike and I.   I suppose I should get in the shower now, before the boys wake up and want to leave. I'll have to add my pictures later so this post will probably be posted later. Thursday 4/22/04 10:30 am

       JOEY     After writing this, it turned into something that probably should have gone on 'Caliblog: reviews', but it's too late now, so whatever.  Well, as Mike mentioned already, we went to see a run-through (final rehearsal) of Matt LeBlanc's 'Friends' spin-off, 'Joey'.  I must say, it was pretty funny.  He was cool, too.  He would gesture to the crowd everytime he would walk by to another scene.  When you watch him you can tell he feels like he has this huge burden on his shoulders to be accepted by 'Friends' fans without the chemistry that made the show so popular.  I would like to see the show succeed, being such a big 'Friends' fan myself, but I think most people are going to use the new show as a sort of 'Friends patch'.  Slowly weening themselves from the show that has been a part of their lives for the last ten years.  Once they have gotten their 'fix' and start looking at the show on it's own, they'll realize the balance that made 'Friends' what it was is missing.  'Friends' was an ensemble cast.  No one person made the show as endearing as it was.  You can call the new show an ensemble, but let's face facts:  people are tuning in to see Joey.  As much as you may like one of the other cast members, they're still going to be his supporting cast.  It's up to LeBlanc to carry the show.  The character is great, don't missunderstand, but too much of any good thing is still too much.  He needs an equal character to play off of and he just doesn't have it.  I hope I'm wrong.  The show that we saw, though...very funny.  It's supposed to kick off in September and I'm looking forward to it.  I guess we'll see what happens then.

       Michelle  I've never been able to get comfortable at this table. Not completely anyway. I tried buying a new chair, but that didn't seem to help the situation. This should be a sign to me that I spend too much time in front of the computer. If I only jumped on for a half-hour each day to check my e-mail and post occassionaly, I doubt the problem would be as severe. However, as it stands [or sits] I'm moderately comfortable in Mike's oversized red chair, for the moment.   I'm still not sure about the overnight gig. I mean here I am at 2am while everyone else is sound asleep. I haven't been able to come up with any ideas for posts in the last couple days. I think I've been a bit frazzled, with Michelle coming so soon. She'll be here in 4 days. I can't wait.  I wanted to write a post about how I met her, but I didn't want to bore anyone. I suppose you guys can scroll down, or skim the paragraphs. Michelle and I sang in the a cappella group together. That's how I met her anyway. Though, at first, I never paid her much attention.   My biggest deterrent was the cross she wore on a silver chain that always hung over her modestly high-necked sweaters; and a best friend that fainted if you cursed and forgot to speak under your breath. I've never seen her in a tank top in public, and she wears pajamas to bed. I'm talking Samantha on "Bewitched", full blown, pants and blouse - 1960's pajamas. It's a cute kind of dorky.   Also she's taller than me - especially in heels. About 6 inches when she wore these giant black heels on Thursdays. (She drove to Detroit to work with autistic kids every Thursday, and always dressed in businesswoman type stuff) I hated that. I can't stand girls that are taller than me. But without the heels it's only a couple of inches and most of the time I don't notice anymore. She's my leggy brunette.   I found it all pretty off putting at first. I didn't think she was anything like me. I'd already used the a cappella group for it's number one asset [Michelle], so I stopped showing up. I always felt like an idiot with the other members anyway, because I was the only one who couldn't read sheet music. I learned all the songs by ear, the way I've always done it. It just doesn't work as well when you're the only one who's supposed to sing your part. Michelle quit too, eventually.  Slowly but surely, I was with her all the time. The more I hung out with her, the more I realized I liked having her around. Before you knew it, we were dating. Nobody said anything for the longest time. So when we decided we needed an official date, I gave Michael Dec. 15th. I know that now, because he put it on his iCalendar, for reasons I can't explain.  Of course, nothing perfect lasts forever, and I got it into my head that I should move to California. Being out here has made me realize how I feel about her. If anything makes the heart grow fonder, it's distance. Not because I'm lonely without her, but because she really made me happy.  I just read all that and I hate it. It's short and muddled, but that's all I've got. I'm gonna go lie down now. I need to get some sleep. Michelle can fill in the details later. Goodnight, anonymous friends.

       a fine line  We all went to see a free run-thru of 'Joey' today over at Warner Bro's. Despite the fact that we had to stand around for three hours before it started, it was fun. But, wow, there are some strange, strange people in the world... and some of them really [and I mean really] like Matt LeBlanc. I was sitting next to a 18 year old girl who apparently was looked at while he was walking from side of the set to the other, and she was in tears going on and on about how he looked her straight in the eyes. The show was okay actually, it was better than I expected it would be. And now that I've seen a run-thru; I hope Matt LeBlanc does well... but something tells me people are going to see Joey and want friends and it's just not going to be friends... and even it tried to be... people would still be turned off by it. But hey, Frasier did well... but then again Frasier is  Frasier .  I'm just talking about nothing [in case you haven't noticed yet], actually, I've been fairly unhappy with my post lately. They've been feeling too forced, and I look back and just see 'blah'. But, then again, what can one expect when they lead such an uneventful life. I need to get some sleep in before work, hopefully my post with start taking a turn for the better.

       my feet are smelly   I just spent four long hours in a muggy truck lifting heavy objects; my feet are sore and smell like dirty socks. Note to self... it's been seven years - time to get new shoes.   Last night Chuck and I dragged Amanda [kicking and screaming] out for a night of running around on camera, we decided it's boring to just make a video of us standing in front of famous objects waving like dorks, so instead we thought we would make a hint more interesting; so with no real opening or explanation, Chuck is being chased by Amanda through the streets of Universal City, down Hollywood Blvd., in and around the Kodak theater / Chinese theater, and in the subways. As of now, the video remains unfinished; it was around one o'clock and we told Amanda we would have her back by midnight since she had get up at six for work (so we suck). But in the end, we had a fun time and if we can come with something goofy for an ending than it should be online soon for all to see. I know... the suspense is terrible.    I think I will be marking sept 5th in my calendar; a US geophysicist, Vladimir Keilis-Borok has  urlLink made the prediction that southern California  [a 19,300-square-kilometer are of it at least] will by hit by a 6.5 earthquake by sept. 5th. Now, for our family members reading; don't be alarmed, earthquakes may do some damage to buildings but in general no one dies during them... if anyone does; it's due to some freak accident. I knew an earthquake would come some day... I suppose I was just hoping to ease into the experience; so much for that.   Blast! I was going to take some pictures with Chuck's digital camera but the batteries are dead. I could walk to the car and get more but I'm too lazy.  I have a dilemma; Ikea called me and offered a job [assuming my criminal background check comes back clean], but if I take it then Amanda and I will be on completely different schedules. Plus, we really like working with eachother. Do I take the Ikea job [which pays more, and has benefits]  or do I stay with Amanda at the dirty Toys 'r' us unloading trucks under the hot California sun?  Well I would like to ramble on for another few paragraphs but Amanda wants to put in "Boyz in the Hood".  Oh but before I go, I have to tell this funny [pointless] story: I was running out to the living room to look up a website I had book-marked on the Mac, and I was trying to be quiet because Chuck was passed out face down on the couch, right as I was making my way past him, out of no where, he woke up as if the police were kicking down the front door and he had a warrant out for his arrest. He jumped so suddenly that it actually made me jump, and then he just sat there on his side; disoriented and foggy-eyed, looking around trying to figure out "what the hell just happened". Perhaps you had to be there. Okay. Goodnight cruel world.

       We've been had.  I was looking at places to advertise today, because I thought maybe we could get paid to put up some ads. In the process, I found a website so similiar to ours that a simple slip of the left hand could result in being brought to the wrong page entirely.  Ladies and gentlemen,  urlLink calblog.com   I'd say we were here first, but his archive goes farther back than ours.

       HI, AGAIN   I know I haven't really posted much as of late, but I really haven't had much to say.  I'm just working at Target a lot.  Chuck and I went out and saw a couple of movies this weekend:   Kill Bill Volume 2  and a private screening of  Mean Girls , which comes out on the 30th  (see Caliblog: Reviews).   Mean Girls  was the first movie that Chuck and I actually went to see at Mann's Chinese Theater, let alone our first Hollywood screening.  I know, why that movie?  But it was a good movie, plus it's written by Tina Fey so it had to be funny.  We both laughed quite a bit.  I will admit, though, we weren't exactly the target audience, considering the crowds of young girls, but, oh well.    I have an interview at IKEA this morning for a supervisor postion, but I'm not all that thrilled about it.  I just figure it's good to see what's out there.  I really want to find a job outside of retail for a while, so I can get involved with one of the many theaters around here.  It's hard to do that when your schedule keeps changing.  I would really like to get into the Groundlings, which is a very popular improve group located out here, but I need some more stage experience.  So, I'm going to try and do as much of that as I can.  I also am going to start putting together a voice sample tape to try to get a job doing voiceovers.  I would be happy just being able to do that.  Anyway, I have to get ready for my interview, so I'll sign off for now.  Ciao!

       "My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it."  We just got back from seeing 'Eternal sunshine'. Incredible, phenomenal movie. I must've cried close to 10 times throughout the whole thing. As I walked out of the theater I said to Mike and Chuck "I want to go see it again tomorrow," fighting back the urge to brake out in tears (once again) as I spoke. It's not even a particularly sad movie, just really hit me some how... can't really explain it. I love to see movies that really effect me. It's such a great feeling.   We saw a preview, before the movie started, for a film called ' urlLink Garden State '. When the preview finished all three of us said, in unison, "That looks awesome". It was very inspiring. I came home and watched the trailer 2 more times. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it when it comes out.  P.S. The title is a quote from the movie.

       v.o. over black  We opted for "Eternal Sunshine" over filming; it would take me ten paragraphs to describe the way it touched and changed me. I recommend it to everyone. I realized 3/4ths of the way into the film; it's been two months since I've picked up my movie notebook. So here I am, sitting alone in the bedroom with the notebook by my side, I think I will open to random pages and pick a section to write here for the world to see [In no particular order]:     above: "sorry... I'm a sucker for random pictures... this one has just been collecting dust on the digital camera for far too long".    + Opening Narrative: "...I can't tell you this story as it should be; as you have grown accustom to: a story with a beginning... a story revolving around love, around revenge, around truth and the way things should be... a story with your all to familiar happy ever after. Because, I really don't know these details. To be honest - if one were to keep in mind to never believe everything one hears - then I don't  know  anything... but I believe in a story - I believe in a man that's name is rejoiced under the breath of people who only have hope to hold on to. A hero to those whose opinions are never heard - and an outlaw to those who measure they're quality of life and self-character by the thickness of their wallets..."  + Opening - (narration) "I was born w/ a bible in my hands and Jesus Christ in my heart... that's what my father always told me."  + Cut to: Tom driving - smiling - (pan down to money and drugs). Cut to: Payphone & Tom. Dials # and waits. Cut to: Chad's phone ringing picks it up as if expecting call.         + Rough idea: Man getting up - getting ready to leave home... gathers up some belongings and goes out door. Goes downtown... and dies. (I don't know how) And either the instant before he dies he sees all these perspective changing things - or directly afterwards. He sees a vision - numbers come into focus - everyone has numbers by them - counting down - and for a moment he thinks everything is pre-determined - but then looking closer he sees the numbers jump up and down when people make little decisions. And that their time left on Earth is determined by which path (literally) we take in life...and then go into how it's not necessarily something to fear - the numbers are chances - chances to do something amazing in your life... maybe in the end he doesn't die - he looks down finally at himself and sees he still has time left...   + Fade in: Girl's bedroom - morning. Girl lays in the arms of guy; both asleep. Girl wears hospital wrist band... both fully clothed.  Flash - hospital. Girl asleep - guy sits next to her in chair...  Cut to: bedroom - Guy wakes up - careful not to wake her..  + Chuck: "she's not my girlfriend..." Billy: "what about the other girls you're seeing"? Chuck: "what other girls"? Billy: "Exactly".  + "I don't want this to be my life. I don't want these to be my mistakes."  + Somewhere out there is (God) change; and if we can find it in ourselves to do that... maybe we will find ourselves one step closer to God.  + For opening scene (falling) use: "What a wonderful world".   It's funny to look at 88% if these notes/ and ideas and outlines... they seem so silly. Perhaps it's time to fill this book with some more recent material. Well... enough for now. I have things I need/ want to get back to.

       do what the tv says and no one gets hurt  I was reading a study today that said 81% of people support ' urlLink tv turn off week ' [which runs from tomorrow until the 25th], but I wonder how many people will actually be able to manage leaving the tube unplugged for a whole  one hundred and sixty eight hours . If it were up to me I would never have the tv on... I can't stand 90% of it. Everytime I hear a laugh track on some random sitcom I think about how the loops the networks use are from the old 60's shows, essentially; you're listening to dead people laughing. I don't know what is worse; the fact that I know that, or the fact that... no - I just decided... I'm twisted for thinking it. Anyways, yeah: tv turn off week... it is definitely [in our culture] a test of endurance and self-control... which when you think about it; is kinda' sad. "Consumerism has got us by the short and curlies".     note: the above image is suppose to be a "mouse-over"... so if you put your cursor over it and nothing happens, or if it just appears funny to begin with; then I apologize.    Today's plans: Either go see ' urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ' or drive to Santa Monica/ Venice and film a short we've been talking about. It's beautiful outside today and I would like to go film... but Amanda is in the mood to go see "Eternal Sunshine" (I guess, technically, she has been in the mood for two months now). It's not that I don't want to go, I just can't say no to a day of filming, but looking at rottentomatoes;  urlLink it has gotten amazing reviews .   Chuck is passed out the couch at the moment, but last night before he took off to go to work; he mentioned that, Nina [his overnight boss/ supervisor/ trainer] doesn't mind the employees printing off their own personal jobs (as long as they aren't huge and time consuming), he had already cut and binded his own personal notepad, he was thinking of making "caliblog" business cards next. We're shameless (and dorks), I know.   There was a small stack of mini-flyers on a table in the break room today as Amanda and I were leaving, apparently Randy [one of our fellow employees] is in a band called; " urlLink Steriofiend ", they have some mp3's it looks like on their site - I haven't listened to any yet, but they do have a girl as their lead singer; which I'm always a sucker for. They're playing at the Roxy on the 25th [hey... the last day of tv turn off week... Coincident? Probably.] Hmm... I wonder if I'll go, it might be fun to check out, I have no idea where or  what  the Roxy is, so based on that alone, it might be educational [considering I don't know anything thing to go do around here yet].   Aparently I thought it was wise to sit my laptop on the floor while writing this post, and now I have a cramp in my neck and my wrists feel funny, worst of all; this post is a little on the boring side... so, I think I'll be wrapping things up for now.

       cont'ed  As I was saying: the interview for Best Buy went well; it was short and the interviewer didn't have a lot of questions for me, which left me wondering what kind of impression I left [too quick to tell], I suppose time will tell. Below I left saying I had to run to the bank before it closed - but less than two minutes after posting I remembered I had an interview at Ikea I had to be at in less than 20 minutes (and it's a ten minute drive). I would go into details but there's nothing really eventful to recap. I guess there never is... I'm just lazy to be honest.   urlLink      By the time any of you read this the 'Great Tower' short will be pulled off our server and replaced with the new weekly movie. It had a good run [71 transfers in 7 days] considering it was our first attempt. Sorry we never got the 'extra(s)' up and running. I am working on it, I swear. Okay, so next up for the  weekly movie :  urlLink a short film titled "y ahora muero" , shot while Chuck was taking film classes at Washtenaw. This [I feel I should warn] particular film is a little on the depressing side. I apologize if anyone watching this is offended, or upset by it's material (that I can assure was not the intentions of the filmmakers). Their intentions were to get a passing grade.     The main character in this short is played by Juan, Juan is an inspiring person to meet. He's from Portugal [if I recall correctly]; he came here [to Ann Arbor, Michigan] by his self... barely speaking any english... enrolled for classes at Washtenaw... and after a short period of time managed to find an apartment walking distance from Ann Arbor... and of course; he found a job. He said the first few nights he was here [ wondering what the hell he was doing ] - he had no where to go, and couldn't easily talk to anyone, he would cry until falling asleep. Some of you assholes out there might crack a joke at that... but I think it's incredibly brave.   " It kind of dwarfs the whole leaving Michigan to come west doesn't' it "?  Anyways; This short played at the Ann Arbor Cinema Slam in 2001, which I admit was a bit of a thrill watching our work on a movie screen. It got a few bad reviews complaining about the choice of music (the score from "American Beauty"), which probably are somewhat legit. But you know what; it's just a film class project. Did they expect us to get it scored? Jerks.  Well, enough rambling from me (for now). We hope you enjoy.  p.s. - I promise next week's short will be less-depressing.

       "we meet again"  I forgot to mention this in my last post: I had an interview for Best Buy a few days ago [they are opening up a store in West Hollywood]; I was running behind (thanks to L.A. traffic...  God bless it ) and had to make it to the 6th floor, so I was half running up the stairs towards the elevators when I looked up to avoid someone coming down the stairwell, and oddly enough; it was  urlLink the fat kid from Sandlot  [again].   Of all the celebrities strolling around this town... I see him twice within a month's time. Why not John C. Reily? By the way, if you [Patrick Renna] are reading this; I apologize for calling you "the fat kid from sandlot". Nothing personal.   Crap, its getting late - we have to run to the bank before rush hour hits. So, hopefully, I will resume this when I get back.

       am i wasting my time with title puns?  Sometimes it's hard not to feel like Jerry Lewis at a telethon with these posts. All I'd need is the microphone because my hands are already sweaty all the time from this blazing hot laptop keyboard. I guess it just goes to show that maybe I'm on it a bit much. I'd be out more, but I only got my first paycheck today. Anyway, I feel like posting is important. I wouldn't want our audience to think we don't care about them. And if chronicalling the boring moments of my everyday life is what makes you people happy then so be it. I can't guess you feel any other way, because nobody comments.  Well, today was sort of uneventful. We were going to go to the beach to shoot a little commercial idea we had, but by the time we were all up and out the door it was already 6pm. The sun was setting, and we were on the 101 in traffic thinking "There's no way we're making it on time." So we just went to the mall and had some Panda Express instead. Somehow we spent almost an hour in the Hello Kitty store.  Then on the way home we went to the Whole Foods Market to get some soy ice cream for Amanda. While we were discussing the difference between fertile and non-fertile eggs, I saw  urlLink Lisa Nicole Carson  from Ally McBeal and ER. I read her profile on IMdB when I got home and apparently she just moved to LA. So for anyone who was wondering, she's probably a vegetarian.  Mike and Amanda and I started talking more about the film group last night. We decided it's going to be called Co-Op Films. I think it's a good name. People should be able to get the idea of what were about right away. I'm not sure how were going to build our base, but how do you start anything really. I woke up from a nap and Mike's already designed a logo which I think is pretty nifty.  Apparently change-of-address forms don't work anymore. Even when you get the confirmation letter in the mail. Several people have mailed me things that aren't making it to my front door. We're not sure why, but if this keeps up, I'm going to have to get a PO Box. If you've sent me something, you might want to keep an eye on your own mailbox to see if it comes back. What really bums me out is that Jessica tried to send me my shoes that I left at home, and I'm sure now they're on a plane back to Michigan, or locked up in a closet somewhere. It's very aggravating. Michelle's letters are the only mail that gets through, oddly enough.  I suppose I'll stop wasting all of our time now. Big day tomorrow. Gotta buy some shoes and convince Billy to go see Kill Bill: Part II with me. I haven't really been dying to see it, but I could use a movie. I mean isn't that why we're out here? Later days, gang.

       you can't spell apathetic without pathetic  While I was making breakfast yesterday morning, I asked Billy what he thought my worst quality was. I'm not sure why I was thinking about it, but he seems to know me as well as anyone, and he's usually pretty straight-forward. So he thought about it for a while, and told me it was my apathy.   apathy:   n. 1. lack of enthusiasm or energy: lack of interest in anything, or the absence of any wish to do anything 2. emotional emptiness: inability to feel normal or passionate human feelings or to respond emotionally   I only put the definition there because I had to go look it up.

       Happy (belated) Birthday, Emily!   I stared to write this post last night, but it got so late, after the landlord dropped by, that Mike wanted me to stop writing so that we could watch "The Devils Backbone", (a movie we rented) before we had to go to bed and we couldn't stay up late because we had to work at 5 am this morning.   My sister turned 26 yesterday (the 13 th). Wow. That means I'll be 25 soon. That makes me feel old. I hope that she had a great birthday, I wish I could've been there.     This picture of my sister and me was taken 3  years ago in Las Vegas, the week we came out for my Uncle Thurmon's wedding. It's my favorite picture of us (she's the one on the left). Aren't we hot!?   My Uncle Thurmon's birthday was on Tuesday of last week (Happy Birthday Uncle Thurm!!!). He and his wife, Tricia, invited us over for a small gathering at their place on Saturday. It was fun; food from the grill and lots of margaritas! It was nice to see them again. It was the first time we've visited with them since we moved into our apartment. I hope that we continue to see them periodically. I'd like to have them over to our new place, but it's still somewhat packed up here. I'd like to be more settled in. I'm weird like that, I want the place to look perfect for our visitors (especially our first visitors).  On Sunday Mike and I went to Ralph's (supermarket) to pick up a ham (they were giving them away free if you spent over $50, which we did on Wednesday but we forgot the ham so we went back, with our receipt) and some other Easter dinner food. Billy bugged us for 2 days to go and get the free ham and after we did, he and Chuck went to his cousins for Easter dinner anyway. Mike and I enjoyed the evening alone. I made ham, scalloped potatoes, green beans, deviled eggs, biscuits and gravy. Mike said it was good. He stuffed himself (and if you know mike, you'd know when I say "stuffed himself", I really mean it).   I haven't written in a really long time, yes, I'm aware of this. I just scrolled down the blog page and noticed that my last post isn't even on the page anymore (you actually have to go to the archives to read it!). Well.... I guess I'll update.... Mike and I are working at Toys R Us. It's ok. I like to work with him. We get to ride together and it keeps us on a similar schedule, which is nice (you know, both sleeping and awake at the same times is good for the relationship). It's also nice when I'm feeling all crappy because I'm at work and it sucks and then I look up and see Mike's smiling face looking at me. That makes me happy every time. We're stocking early in the morning which is cool cause then we have the rest of the day free. We also both interviewed at Best Buy (just to keep our options open) earlier this week. They do a series of 3 interviews so we won't know anything for a while. They are opening a new store in West Hollywood some time next month, so that's were we'd be going. We'll let you know if anything comes out of that. If they offer me a job, I may do both (TRU and Best Buy) for awhile, since they'll both most likely be part time, and to see which I like best.    I'm feeling a bit more settled everyday (so hopefully we won't have to leave). My Tibetan prayer flags are up and the smell of nag champa is in the air. Mike and I returned the car top carrier we used for our move here to Target and got a cupboard (to put some of my art stuff in and pictures and candles on) and a table for the TV and DVD player. I've done my best to make our bedroom feel like home for me. It's my little escape I guess. This place can get very small if we're all home all the time (as I believe Chuck mentioned in an earlier post). Occasionally I do feel like I'm a tag-a long and they're all just wishing that I would leave. But I know that I can get a bit overly sensitive sometimes so I'm trying not to worry about it. It has been nice having a little of Mike's undivided attention lately. For the most part, it's helped to get me out of the emotional rut (relationship wise) that I was in last week.   I wish this post was less boring, I have more things to say but I really don't feel like they're the kind of things I should post on the blog. I would like to start writing more so I can do less catching up on the boring stuff and more of just writing what I'm feeling.   But for now I've said too much and I have to go.

       falling asleep on the beach  Equals bad. Well, I'm burnt to a crisp, my face hurts no matter how relaxed I keep my expression. To explain; Amanda and I got out of work around noon, now after the confrontation with Ted last night, we weren't going to take any chances; I spotted our resident manager talking to a plumber only feet from the stairway leading to our apartment, so - Amanda bolted back for the car, I walked past the two smiling and casually came inside - I changed - packed a change of cloths for Amanda - grabbed a camera - and we headed for Santa Monica to kill some time.   Thats when Amanda thought it would be a good idea to lay down in the sun for awhile - so we strolled down the ocean and laid in the sand. Next thing I know - it's an hour later - there isn't a cloud in the sky; and of course - I am red as a lobster now. Which sucks.  So the moral of this story is don't fall asleep on the beach.     Above: I was surfing the internet, looking at other random blogs, when I stumbled across this photo - you can only see four of the rock stacks in this photo, but in reality there are about thirty of them [most as tall as myself]. This was taken at a beach in Venice, I only know this because Amanda and I went for a walk there two weeks ago. I highly recommend walking the Venice strip and checking these out... they seem to defy the laws of gravity. There are no rods, or cemented joints used to support the rocks. Actually; while Amanda and I were there, a small group of people walked up and barely (very barely) touched one, and it toppled over, and of course - they couldn't put it back.      Above: Another random picture from  urlLink the same site I found the rock picture on . I don't know why, but I think this picture is awesome. I think I am just a sucker for flying above clouds; feels like your in an entirely different world when all you can see is rolling 'hills' of white. Yup. Ok, thats all the random pictures for today.   Anyways; to calm some of your nerves - I talked to our landlord on the phone for fifteen minutes and it went well. I won't go into details, but I will just say; I think we lay low for a while, things will be fine. So thats a relief. I know I will definitely sleep better tonight than I did last night. Anyways;  I wasn't sure I was going to bring this up [it still being in the very early stages of planning] but; " what the hell ", I am going to start a film production/ community/ democracy/ network... ("see, I don't even know  what  to call it yet"), but here is the idea behind it:  When I was young, and first learning to draw, I copied from comics I read, and pictures I liked, and of course; after many years of practicing from good examples, I didn't need to copy anymore. I moved past the imitation process and started to create drawings from scratch. So - I think it would be a very useful learning process to take that idea and apply it to film; to take scenes and moments from our favorite films/ shorts and recreate them.   Well, back in Michigan this idea was difficult to push considering Chuck and I knew about two, maybe three other people interested in film... not exactly a crew. But here; "...thats a different story all together".  Of course, we wouldn't  just  do scenes or shorts from existing films, but it would help to keep busy - and to familiarize ourselves with each-other as well as with the [preferred] creation process. The group would consist of volunteers (who go through a simple interview process... "don't want to get any crazies in the group"), these volunteers would make-up a board/ democracy (so to speak) that would vote on projects and help share the responsibility of production, from 'pre' to 'post'. Groups would be formed - and for each individual project people would be rotated in their area(s) of interest. And thats it; hopefully the group would slowly grow and grow and take on new levels and help people like us network and accomplish films we can be proud of, and more importantly; learn things that better us as filmmakers.  So, thats it in a nut-shell. Now, if you'll excuse me; I have to go apply more aloe to my face.

       what a tangled web  Ok, so last night we got a little scared, and our posts were a little hasty. I just want to let everyone know not to worry. We'll figure this thing out. And if the person who would freak the most can say that, you've got to believe it's true. Somehow, we'll either make things cool with the management or find a new place to stay. We're all working, so that's not a problem. I mean sure, we might have to live with friends for a week or two while we find a new place (if it comes to that), but we have people that would let us crash. So no worries, people. Remain calm.  I'm not entirely sure why we lied in the first place. Apparently it's the only way to get an apartment in LA. Though I don't see what good it does us if we get kicked out. I guess it had something to do with our credit histories, or maybe just that we're four people in a two-bedroom. I suggested fessing up (due largely to my lifetime fear of authority figures), but nobody agrees with me. I guess it probably wouldn't do much good at this point.  Mike's going to call the landlord today. Billy's going to write him a script of exactly what to say and how to say it. I think we're going to tell them he was planning on adding me, but just hadn't mentioned it yet. We're hoping it might be effective in getting me on the lease. Then the only person left to explain would be Amanda.   Frankly, I think the guy knows everything and he's going to kick us out the first chance he gets. Not to mention keeping our $2,200 deposit for his trouble.  I take it back. Resume freaking out.

       the time to hesitate is through  So it looks like we're going to get kicked out of our apartment. Call me the pessimistic one, but I've got a bad feeling about this. Our landlord stopped by today for a little chat with Billy and Mike. He kept asking Mike if it was just the two of them here. And what could Mike keep telling him but yes. Unfortunately, they've seen us all here for the past month,  all  the time, so it's got to be painfully obvious that it's not just two bachelors living here.   This is stressful. I just got a job, and now it looks like I might not have a place to live soon. Our only plan is to find a way to tell our landlord without him kicking us out, or split up into two one-bedroom apartments. Currently I'm checking prices on Extended Stay hotels.   We're screwed.  (p.s. No April fools, guys. This time it's serious.)

       my heart is pounding   We just had a visit from our landlord, Ted. It didn't go well. Chuck and Amanda hid in the bathroom while I stood and introduced Billy (the only other person Ted knows about... kinda'), I was nervous the moment he knocked on the door. As he stood there in the doorway; looking past us as we spoke; waiting for something that suggested more than two people were and have been occupying his apartment. I was asked five times [not once or twice... five times] if I was being honest. God... my heart is pounding. I wish we would just be left alone, we'll pay rent on time, we'll be quiet, we're nice people. We plan, we've planned all along, on getting Chuck on the lease - looks like that will have to be done sooner than originally expected. I hope this blows over... we don't need this... we're not even on our feet 100% yet. To trip and fall, actually, to be pushed from behind and fall flat on our faces now would be discouraging to say the least.  Well... we'll see how this pans out. We are all brain storming on our "how not to get kicked out" strategy. Okay, writing this entry isn't helping my nerves as I hoped it would. I have to go be nervous somewhere else. Stay tuned.

       Even God had his day of rest...  I've adjusted to working overnight, but I'm in serious need of a day off. Fortunately, today is that day. I worked last night, but I didn't get out until 8am. We had one job to finish and I was trying to squeeze it in before 7am. I was supposed to cut some paper in half and bind the halves with coil, but when I took it to the cutting machine, I put the numbers in wrong and it cut the thing in half. So we had to make it all over again and I had to stay an extra hour. The funny part was that when we reprinted it, we realized the day crew had collated it incorrectly and the cover was on the back. So if I hadn't screwed it up, we'd have given it to the customer with the cover bound to the back of the book.   Meanwhile, I'm out of money. And I mean almost completely out. I'm down to my last $18, so if I don't get paid on Friday, it's going to be a rough two weeks. I still have to buy myself a haircut and a pair of comfortable shoes. Speaking of haircuts, sorry to everyone who voted I keep the goatee, cause I shaved it off. I was getting tired of the hair on my face. I couldn't stop thinking about it all the time so I got rid of it. I know that sounds wierd, but I'm a very self-aware person.  Only two weeks left 'til Michelle comes to visit. Hopefully I'll have some money to actually take her out. Knowing she'll be here soon just makes me miss her. If I knew I wasn't going to see her in a year, my mind might not be so occupied with her all the time. I promise I'll put up lots of pictures of her vacation. I know she's a fan of pics on the site.  Billy and I went to his cousin Crystal's on Easter Sunday. She made an awesome dinner, basically just for us. We had ham, apple pie, stuffing, mashed potatoes, deviled eggs, and caserole. She's a really cool chick. Hopefully we'll be able to score some barbecue off her on the 4th of July. Mike and Amanda opted to hang back here. Amanda made mike some eggs and ham and other stuff. Mike pretty much polished off the entire 11lbs ham by himself. I don't know how he keeps that girlish figure.  Once we all have a day off here, we should be working on one or more of the shorts. Hopefully one of which will be put up on the blog. I don't know which movie Mike's selected for the next "movie of the week", but I have a feeling it's going to be my student film "y ahora muero". It's a pretty depressing short, but I like it. Some good editing and one of the best shots Mike's ever gotten.  I know not much has happened lately of interest. I think Billy's all but given up writing on the blog for now. He doesn't seem to think anything interesting is happening. Myself, I'll keep posting no matter what. I'd post if I was bed ridden for a week. Mike's more interested in the technical aspects right now, and Amanda just can't find the time. Hopefully we'll all get back in the swing of it. With more readers than ever, this is the time to flourish.   I hope maybe this website can sort of work as a gateway for us. If we can get recognized and someone pops on here and downloads a short, maybe they'll offer us jobs somewhere. We are, after all, near about 5 major studios, all within 5 miles. Even the Cartoon Network's right down the street.  On a completely different note, someone mentioned last week that I was the youngest of the four of us. I thought it was funny that I hadn't really put any thought into that before. It just occurred to me that I'm really young. 21 just feels really young right now. Don't ask me why, 'cause I couldn't tell ya.  Bridget has promised to send me pictures of my going-away party at Zoup, so I'll post them as soon as she gets around to it. That was the night I had 10 shots inside 10 red bulls, in case you'd all forgotten. The debauchery was set on high that night, so the pictures should be fun. I might have to do some clever editing. Anyway, just thought I'd mention that.

        urlLink      We here at caliblog are always striving to keep our small but growing audience base interested and coming back for more. Your comments help guide us in the right direction - so don't be shy to suggest new ideas you would like to see, or just to let us know we're on the right track [Hold on my water is boiling].  Okay [many hours later *] back to the subject at hand: the newest idea / addition to caliblog; [drum roll] a weekly movie.  How does this weekly movie work ? Well, I'll tell you - since the short films we'll be uploading on our server will be anywhere from 5 to 15 MBs in size - they will only be available for a short period of time [hence; the week]. Now, to be honest; when I started this entry last night - I was only intending on linking a movie for a week, but I am getting a handful of ideas sitting here staring at the screen.   First idea: the "weekly movie" will be given the top slot on our links (to the left), it will tell the length and size of the file, (second idea:) it will have trivia for the film as well as credits and when it was shot. Hmm... (third idea:) maybe if our server has the space ( ...and Andrew, if you're reading this - that was not a plee for more free space... we can actually buy more this time ) we'll link extra features, like a DVD would have, commentary, perhaps a behind-the-scenes slideshow. Okay, I think I might be getting carried away.     Draw back the red curtains, our first short film is actually one of the first short films Chuck and I shot. It was filmed on location in Tecumseh, MI. Hmm... (fourth idea: movie synopsis), this film I think, might require more of an introduction than most. This short titled; 'Return to the Great Tower', is a sequel to a film shot by a good friend of ours, Kevin, his film (titled, 'The Great Tower') is about... we'll actually, it's on the artsy / expressionist side and I'm never quiet sure what it is about. But to be as simple about it as I can be, there's a guy and he is called to a great tower (a water tower) and there he receives a gift. So, our addition to his project was for the most part just a tip-of-the-hat to Kevin for being who he is. Anyways; The Return to the Great Tower is an unfinished project, but the clip which you are about to watch; is the finished opening sequence / credits for the short.  So, with out further ado; Rolling Chair Productions in association with caliblog, presents: ' urlLink The Return to the Great Tower ' ( note: due to it's size - we would suggest right-clicking on the link and saving it to your hard-drive ). Enjoy.   *  We [Amanda, Billy and myself] ate some mac and cheese with hotdogs... well, Amanda had tofu, but anyways, then we drove out to spy on Chuck- see how he was doing on his first day on the job. We laminated our social security cards (even though on the back it recommends you do not).

       mommy, why is the bunny being whipped?  Truth is far stranger than fiction: I would like to start this blog on a very disturbing note;     ...a church trying to teach about Jesus' crucifixion performed an Easter show with actors whipping the Easter bunny and breaking eggs.  Performers broke eggs meant for an Easter egg hunt and also portrayed a drunken man and a self-mutilating woman...  Melissa Salzmann, who brought her 4-year-old son J.T., said the program was inappropriate for young children. "He was crying and asking me why the bunny was being whipped," Salzmann said.    I am speechless. All I can think is; organized religion is starting to scare me. Chuck spotted this on yahoo!'s homepage, you can  urlLink read more about it here .   Moving on: Livi won Billy's riddle (which read; " Name two eight letter words, one of which is one syllable and the other five syllables , the answer was; " How about... 'strength' and 'ideology' "), she'll soon be receiving our grand prize; a handful of 'Grind you local library' stickers from 'sendtretter©'. In case some of you are wondering what the sticker means, "grind" is a skater term, so for the most part, it means: Rebel, and skate at your local library. Now you know, and that's half the battle.  Well, the t.v. is spouting out commercial after commercial, and I can't think, so till later.

       All alone  Work has finally separated us. Mike and Amanda are sleeping, since they have to be up in 5 hours to go to Toys R' Us, and Billy's at Target doing an overnight. So, for the first time in a while, it's only 1am and I'm the only person on a computer. Creepy.  The place I applied at called me today and I passed my background and drug tests. Not that I was worried I might fail, but it was nice to do well on a test. I go in today around 10am to fill out my final paperwork and seal the deal. She's going to start me on Friday night. Then it's back to the night owl schedule for me. It's going to suck while Michelle's here, but I actually prefer overnights. Always less people, and even less employees.  As I've mentioned before, I'm still going to interviews for other jobs. I figure what the heck, if they're willing to pay more, I might be willing to switch. The lady that called all three of us about the Best Buy interviews told Mike and Amanda to wear suits if they had them. She never said it to me, which I found unusual, but I've decided to wear the suit that I just happen to have. Purchased by none other than my father. It's a really nice suit. I rarely get to wear it, because I don't have an office job or attend church regularly, but I like it a lot. I think a suit makes a man look that much better, even if he's not all that attractive. Like Pat Sajak.   The guy at Toys R' Us that was telling Mike and Amanda all the rules of the store warned them that when people are jerks, they should just walk away and get a manager. He went on to use Jennifer Love Hewitt as an example. Apparently, she'd been in the store a week ago and acted "like a B". His words, not mine. This is my first bit of celebrity gossip since I've arrived. I'm sure Mike and Amanda will get their share of celebs in a store that's in the top ten most shopped in LA. We were discussing the other day that we've been here for two weeks and already I've seen 3, Amanda's seen 4, and Mike's seen 6 celebs. It's wierd.  Nobody seems to be posting. I hate for two of mine to fall right on top of each other, but if I have to work on this thing by myself, so be it. I've been trying to increase our monthly hits by using a different trick each day. Mike put us on a link exchange. I visit sites that I like and leave comments with our web address connected to it. I'm a shameless self-promoter, but it's working like a charm. And we seem to be getting an excellent response from Blogger's homepage as well. I hope all you new readers like the site.  We've learned how to save a little bit of server space, so hopefully we'll have more movies for everyone to download soon. Everyone seems to enjoy them, so we'll keep making them. Hopefully, on a sunnier day this time. The last video was grey, trust me, compared to what LA usually looks like. The sunlight here is never in short supply. And we're going to have vids to prove it.

       four punchlines to the same joke: the caliblog writers  Last night the water got shut off at midnight. Apparently a pipe burst in the basement and our landlord wasn't sure what to do about it. Mike and I had just gotten back from a run around town. We ran past some girls and one of them shouted "Isn't it a little late to be running?". Before Mike could answer I decided to try and make us sound cool and said back "Never.", as though I run more than twice a year. Mike thought later that it might have been funnier to say "What would you suggest we do at this time of night?", but only Billy would have thought of that one on the fly.  So we get back, sweating like mad, and the shower doesn't work. So we try the kitchen sink and the bathroom and the toilet and nothing's on. I was certain it was rent-related, since we decided to pay on the last possible day. It just seemed odd that it worked at 11:59 and stopped at midnight exactly. This morning the water from the pipes was draining into the street.  I've noticed the past couple weeks that our neighborhood is primarily Latino. All the shouting that takes place on the block at night is usually in Spanish. There's a lady next door who constantly yells at her children in a tounge I don't understand. Billy and I have started trying to find online lessons, but I haven't listened to them yet. I'd like to learn it, if I can. All I know now is how to say hello and the directions left and right.  I've never talked about it before, but I just wanted to say that all the people here have been really nice. I know there's a stigma attached to residents of big cities like Los Angeles, but so far, I haven't met a single jerk. The only encounters we've had have been with motorists. And people act differently when they're behind the wheel of a car. A guy in an SUV cut us off today really bad. If Amanda hadn't told us not to, we probably would have thrown a handful of pennies at his car. (Come to think of it, that probably wasn't the best idea.) Speaking of cars, we saw one today that had all four wheels stolen. It was parked right outside Universal Studios. So if you buy nice rims, buy a car alarm. There were cops all over the place.  Amanda took us to this really expensive diner called Jerry's. The special on hot dogs was two for $11. They actually had a $6 peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She felt really bad for suggesting the place, so we made sure to rub it in a lot. We also saw Cedric the Entertainer just as we were leaving. He's really short. Only about 5'8".     The reason for my title (which I half borrowed from Billy) is just to say that I really enjoy the posts of my fellow writers. I think what keeps this site fresh are the eclectic styles it contains. I hope everyone reading it enjoys it as much as I do. Once more things start happening to us, I promise it'll be a little more exciting to read. Until that day, it's going to be grocery shopping and celebrity sightings.  On a more personal note, Michelle told me she's said much nicer things about me before. She told me I should have posted one of those comments instead of the ones I chose. Actually, I was just trying to get a rise out of everyone, but apparently I've failed. Becky went so far as to say it was sweet. And I was only doing it to be funny. Oh well. I guess I can't please everyone. Or can I....?  (P.S. 17,000 hits in 5 days. I know some of you people are new. Don't be afraid to leave comments.)

       andrew saves the day (again)  Caliblog apparently has a guardian angel. The gang at caliblog owes thanks to Andrew from  urlLink get me online  for the extra 25 MBs of server space for free, we had no idea you had been keeping up on our adventures and mishaps; and especially that you thought enough of us to donate space. You saved the day again, Andrew. I wish there was some way we could do something for you [besides keep paying for server space --  which we will definitely be doing ], if your reading, and there is a p.o. box we could send a card to, it would be the least we could do. Otherwise; thank you very much... we've never met, but our impression is "you're one hell of a nice guy".     Above: Just to hold our audiences' attention; a random picture with the four of us in it! This was taken about a year ago at a good friend's birthday/ halloween party. I'm in there -- hiding behind Amanda and her devil horns. (Wait, this is my chance to score some brownie points;) look at how beautiful Amanda is... damn her for being so photogenic, when I can't take a normal picture to save my life.    And now; back to more recent events. As you can see from the last entry, we've been experimenting with  urlLink audblog ; you can call in by phone from anywhere, anytime and leave, basically, a voice message that the service automatically time stamps and post on your site. Anyways, there's a  urlLink method fest  going on down the street in Burbank, Dennis Hopper spoke there yesterday -- maybe if anything interesting is going on in the next few days we'll drop by and make a call during one of their concerts, or guest speakers.  Today kinda' sucked. I slept most of it away on the floor with half my body under the futon. I don't know why exactly, I just felt bummed and sleepy. Around nine o'clock at night we [Chuck, Amanda and myself] thought we would go out and catch a showing of  urlLink 'Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind' , but before the movie, we needed to eat.  Long (and boring) story short:  we should have eaten tacobell; missed the 10:05 showing; ate at Jerry's on Ventura and it sucked ass  [read more about it on our new  urlLink caliblog: reviews  site... be gentle, it's a work in progress];  the busses weren't running at Universal, so we walked; we missed the last showing at City Walk; and now - I have upset stomach .   But on the plus side, we saw  urlLink Cedric the Entertainer  while we were leaving Jerry's, he was short, thats all I have to say. And while we were parking across the street from Universal we drove past a car sitting on two cinder blocks [we are still kicking ourself for not having the digital camera handy] that had all four of it's tired removed, apparently while they were in the park. I have to admit as much as that would suck... it was pretty damn funny.   Due to the bonus server space: you all can expect a new and improved tour of the apartment. We have been half-waiting for Billy; who wants to move some of his belongings into storage before we unveil the curtain (so to speak). If we have the time, we might actually make it more of a "tour" tour instead of just someone running around the rooms with a camera, maybe we'll make it into a bit of a sketch. Hmm... or maybe that would be lame. Who knows? You'll just have to stay tuned.  Chuck lost his free wireless internet connection yesterday. Either someone caught on to his piggy-backing, or else they just don't have it on for whatever reason. Oh well, it was good and fun (and illegal) while it lasted. Well, it's 3:30 in the morning, and even though I slept all day, I should probably try to go to bed since I have orientation tomorrow (or today, I guess), and I don't want to have to go straight there out of bed. So, goodbye and goodnight, for now.

       Michelle is a sweetie.  I thought, since Michelle is coming to see me in a few weeks, that it might be nice to let everyone know what she thinks about me. Brace yourself, folks. I now present, the nicest thing Michelle's ever said about me, and the meanest thing she's ever said about me (true, though it may have been).   "...My stupid boyfriend was supposed to come over tonight after I got out of rehearsal and got done practicing. He told me to call him when I was done. I called, he didn't answer. Called again about 10 minutes later. Still didn't answer. I guess it wouldn't be too big of deal, except that he has my car because his stupid truck is broken and stuck in some guys driveway next to his best friend's house.  And since he works about 45 minutes away ... I don't want him to lose his job, I loaned him my car until he could figure something else out. Thinking that, when I called him, I'd be able to talk to him and that he'd come to see me. Apparently not. I don't know why I put up with so much crap."   And here's the nicest thing I could find.   "Chuck came over around 7, we got a pizza, and flipped back and forth between Independence Day and the Super Bowl.  We watched the last few minutes of the game, and from what I've heard those were the only good minutes of the game.  After that he stuck around til about 11:30 and went over to his Mike's."   Here's what we looked like the last time I saw her.        p.s. I miss her.

       Finally!     Well, after being here a few weeks, I'm finally back to work starting today.  I went and talked to the Store Manager at a Target out here this morning.  I'm going to go in and help out another team this week and probably start training to be a Cashier/Guest Service Supervisor next week.  Now I can go buy something...WooHoo!    If you haven't looked at the video clip from Mike's post, you should.  It's kind of cool.  Just be warned-it will take a few seconds to get started, but be patient.    Okay, well I'm going to go outside and build a snowman and then come in for some hot chocolate.  Take care...

       hollywood hike  As Billy mentioned yesterday, we went hiking in and around the Hollywood Hills off of Mulholland Drive. Unfortunately caliblog is low on server space [we are in the process of buying more] but I had to cut the video shorter than I would have preferred. When we left the apartment the sky was clear and sunny, and when we got the lookout point the sky had turned grey... it was still nice out but we couldn't see the ocean and the city was kinda' foggy on the eyes.  Well our first month's rent is due today, so I have to go get ready to make a run to the bank. So, for your own personal enjoyment;  urlLink the caliblog: season one video  you've all been waiting for.     Oh, I almost forgot;  anyone who gets Billy's question below will win a hand full of 'sendtretter©' stickers (pictured above) signed by Chuck himself. If thats not incentive, I don't know what is.

       Chuck's blog of note.  Found a blog today. It's a girl that writes poems using only the subject lines of hundreds of spam e-mails she gets every day. And it's actually decent poetry.    urlLink Here she is.   Mike and Amanda disappeared into their room at about 6:30. It's been a few hours, so I was starting to get worried, but Amanda just popped out again. It's 10:30. Let me just say...  I have  no  idea what was going on in there.

       catching up  Okay. I'm going to do some catching up on old pictures Amanda and I took while on the road. Partly because I have been putting it off, and partly because half-way into my entry my computer crashed and I lost what I was writing... so I'm too lazy to re-write it. First:     Above: Amanda snapped this one while driving (obviously), I really like it. For the most part it is probably all Amanda could see of me for 5 days.     Above: I don't know what I am doing, but I'm standing outside of a TacoBell somewhere in New Mexico, we had pulled over because the sun was making our eyes heavy.     Above: Ray, Amanda's step-dad, took this picture the morning we left. I know, how our cars made it is a mystery to me too.     Above: Here's the marquee for a parking lot we crashed in for a few hours, it was a little rough, Amanda emptied out my passenger side so she could sleep next to me (plus she didn't leave any room behind her seats... so, they didn't lean back). It kept getting cold in the car, and every hour and a half I would wake up and start the car for ten minutes with the heat blaring. Really, I was more worried Ypsi [my hamster] would get too cold. Speaking of Ypsi, here's a picture:     Above: This picture was taken in a vegas hotel about an hour before Amanda and I left for the casino's, I believe I am talking to my mom on the phone; letting her know that I was still alive and well.      Above: We were too hungry to go grocery shopping, so as usual, we settled for TacoBell.  Damn convenient, fatty fast food.  This was our first night in the apartment, Chuck and Billy didn't arrive till later the next night, we had no furniture... just a futon mattress and some sheets. But still it felt great to finally be in our new home sweet home.     Above: We tried to do most of our driving at night, since it's easier on the eyes and there's less traffic, which is a bonus when you have so many personal belongings in and on your car you can't see anything but ahead.      Above: Here's what I am talking about, blinds spots all over the mother-- this is at the New Mexico border... it looks like it might actually be warm, but actually it was freezing. Matter of fact; only two hours later we were driving through a full blown snow storm.  Well, that's about all the pictures I have worth posting. Plus, it's come to my attention that we are running a little low on server space, so time to upgrade. Yesterday at the Studio City Kinko's I got some new "caliblog.com  season one " stickers printed up, so keep an eye out.  Chuck and I were just discussing caliblog merchandise [yes... we are shameless self-promoters], maybe some t-shirts, some new stickers, your basic cali-coffee mug, you get the idea.  "Goulet" ! Actually we were just saying it would be cool for our own use to have these things, but hey, if people out there show interest; you never know.

       a fun day  I woke up around 8am today and decided to go for a little walk. So I drove to Burbank and parked next to the Cartoon Network corporate headquarters on Third & Palm. I walked around downtown for a little bit to check out all the stores. Then I was crossing a street and a guy walked up next to me and said "I didn't see any cops." At first I thought he was a nutball, but then I realized he was talking about a motorcycle cop down the street. He was giving pedestrians tickets for crossing when the light wasn't on. So fair warning to anyone visiting California, don't cross a street the way you would in Ann Arbor, MI. Billy already got a $45 ticket for parking on the wrong side of the street.   So Mike and Amanda came in second on the employment race. They both got jobs at Toys R' Us yesterday. We were all getting a little concerned about the money situation, so this comes as very good news. Looks like were going to be able to pay rent in May. Yahoo!  I started working on a script today that Billy and I had talked about back when I worked at Target. It's about 5 hired assassins, and I think it's pretty funny. We've been working on a short as well, but I was getting sorta depressed since the subject matter was a little serious. Parts of the stuff I was writing today were making all three of us laugh out loud. I take it as a good sign. Hopefully, we'll all be working on it some more.  I'm still adjusting to life in California. I know I haven't posted in a couple days. I've felt a little out of place these last few days. I miss everyone back home, but not in a gut-wrenching way. I guess it was just a combination of not finding work and being cooped up in the apartment all day. We don't have a lot of entertainment money to be throwing around right now.  Ok, so when we got here a couple weeks ago I was looking pretty scraggly. I hadn't shaved in a week or so and I was starting to get all the scruff growing in. Billy told me to shave it into a goatee and I did, and I really like it a lot. I think for the first time I actually did something that makes me look a little older. However, in the spirit of democracy, I'll be holding an open forum on whether or not I should keep it. Are Billy and Mike enough facial hair for one house? Toss your vote into the comments and maybe I'll post a picture or something later.  It's hard to think of things to write about now. I think on some level we're still pretty mixed up over here (emotionally speaking). I had no idea how much this move was going to test me. I'm always so worried about keeping everyone happy in a neutral kind of way that I often forget to deal with my own stuff. I know that doesn't make sense, but I don't think there's another way to type it.   Is it safe for me to be talking about all of this? I hope there aren't any psychos out there trying to track us down by the information we put on the blog. I don't think we've given any of our last names, but everyone knows where we work and what our place looks like. If you are crazy, and you're reading this, we're good people. Leave us alone.  To all my Michigan people, it's good to hear from you all. I have ten e-mails in my box to respond too. Sorry if it takes me a while (even though I'm not doing much during the day right now). Of course my job is overnight so I guess I'll never be doing much during the day. Keep writing and I'll write you back.  Billy and I are trying to learn spanish. Half the people in this city speak it, so we think it'll come in handy. Right now he's listening to a program he downloaded on Kazaa. Turns out it's all about how to swear in Spanish, so we know a few choice phrases already. We'll have to keep looking...

       politics are funny  I was reading  urlLink some news on Powell ... and something occured to me: Why doesn't the Bush administration give Saddam a lie detector test?  With everyone involved with Iraq under the gun about it's legitimacy, why wouldn't the white house just put the man with all hidden stockpiles of WMDs infront of a camera and ask him some questions? Hmm... strange.

       The coolest thing about living in L.A  I saw (fuckin') John C. Reilly!!! Can you believe that? Mike, Chuck and I were all pretty much speechless, for over a hour yesterday, after we spotted  urlLink John C. Reilly  loading up his car in the Ikea parking lot. At first we all just tried to "act cool" and walk by like we didn't notice, but then Mike just had to say something. "I know you must get this all the time, but you were really great in Boogie Nights, thats like our favorite movie." And John C. Reilly replies, with a smile, "Oh...Thanks!". WOW! Were we star struck or what? It's one thing to see someone you kind of recognize but don't know their name, or someone really popular the everyone would know (like Jay Leno) but too see somemone you really, really, genuinely  like, and think is a great actor and is in some of your favorite movies (Magnolia, The Good Girl, etc...)..... yeah...it was cool.      Today Mike said we should've beaten him up, thrown him in our trunk, and brought him home to have him act out scenes from his movies for us. (if John C. Reilly ever happens to read this...we're not crazies, we would never really do that)  Billy and Chuck are watching The Muppet Movie right now, (where they move to Hollywood to try and make it in show-biz) ironic, huh? Mike is busy setting up his laptop so I will finally have a computer of my own to use. And I just finished making my favorite [vegan meal],  urlLink sesame tofu and potatoes .....YUM!  Ahh, just another fun-filled Friday afternoon, here in North Hollywood, where the sky is grey and it rained yesterday. That's right I said "rained". Only lightly, for about an hour, but the streets flooded. They have a really crappie drainage system here.  Some of you may be wondering why it always seems to take me so long to post. Well, I am the only person here without a computer of their own. Honestly, these guys really do spend 95% of the time, that they are home and not sleeping, on their computers. It's sickening. Mike will let me use his for a minute, but he gets so antsy and doesn't know what to do with himself. And it's hard to concentrate out here at the x-large L-shaped desk where all 3 of their computers are (loud music on one side, porn on the other). Fortunately Mike got his laptop working and I should be able to use that, as my own, in the bedroom for a while. (Thanks Mike, I love you)  Chuck got a job today (the same position Mike had an interview for, but missed, while I was interviewing at J.Jill). Mike and I both have interviews at Toys R Us tomorrow. Toys R Us was actually the first place that I planned on applying to when I got here, because I have so much experience with them (5 years), but when I called a couple  of weeks ago they said they weren't hiring. I decided to give them a try again yesterday and this time, asked for a manager and he seemed really excited. He asked me to come in right away and fill out an app. When I turned in the application I asked for him (so I could give it to him directly) and when he walked up he knew exactly who I was, "your the girl who called" "yes, that was me".   I got a letter in the mail box from my dear, sweet Jenny, today! Yay! I miss that girl. I miss my monday night girls nights, most of all. And my mom.... I miss my mom. I wrote  (typed) my Grandma a letter last night. I wanted to actually write it on a card or something but after about a paragraph my handwriting can get almost illegible.   So far I haven't noticed a big difference between living life here or in MI, other than the weather. It's still life as usual. Still gotta work and pay the bills, run errands, do laundry, blah blah blah... But the weather is worth it. The entire climate is 100% different. We are surrounded by mountains and green and flowers and citrus trees. I love it! And of course... the ocean. Stepping out of your door into beauty always brightens your day.     I feel great. I feel happy. I'm proud for myself for doing this.  My life might not be perfect, but at least I feel like I'm doing something about it.

       O.K., maybe not.    Well, let me just tell you the kind of response I got to my April Fool's Day entry.  I received quite a few e-mails, some calling my bluff, some a little worried, and some just plain pissed off-not to mention a phone call or two.   Of course it was a joke!   Sure, maybe we are running low on funds, and yes, I do hate Mike with every fiber of my being, but I'm here for the long haul one way or the other.  Even if Chuck's 'come hither' eyes do pierce through me, like sunlight through an hourglass, I can take it.  I'll admit, the first week was hard, but things are good, now.-----So to summerize:  Amanda's the responsible one, hate Mike, Chuck wants me, I'm staying.  That's about it.  Ciao, for now!

       Well, that was fun...     Regretably, today will be my last post.  My part of this little adventure has come to an end, for money reasons as well as reasons I'd rather not mention.  I admit, my decision to do this is even hastier than my decision to move out here (It all happened around two o'clock this morning), but this is a safer choice.  My grandmother is going to buy a plane ticket for me to go to Tennessee.  I can stay with her until I get some savings built back up or indefinitely, if need be.  I just realize that this isn't what I want.  I wish nothing but the best for the rest of the group.  I'm sure they'll do great.  A lot of you knew I wasn't all that crazy about coming out in the first place, but you still supported me.  Thank you, so much.  You can still e-mail at my link if you want, but I will not be posting anymore-So, I just want to say thank you, goodbye, and God bless...

         I wanted to say happy Memorial Day to everyone out there.  I hope everyone who had a three day weekend enjoyed yourselves.  Actually, I'm sure most people won't read this until tomorrow, so...Happy Tuesday, everyone.  Woo-Hoo!!!     I, unfortunately, did have to work today.  I'm spending the week training at stores that are a bit out of the way for my job.  Oh well, at least I have tomorrow off.  I can watch the Piston's game.  Hopefully, they can put it away tomorrow night.  I was actually supposed to go to a screening of 'The Stepford Wives' with Nicole Kidman (Well, the movie stars Nicole Kidman.  I'm not actually going  with  her.  Though, that would probably get me to dimiss the Piston game a lot easier) down in Hollywood, but it could be the final game of the series.  I want to see if my boys make it to the finals tomorrow or not.  They're back at home so...     I wanted to tell those out there who are a little unsure of my stance on living in California that, despite what some of you may think or may have heard, I am not going to be leaving the Golden State anytime soon.  I'm here for the long haul.  I'll be here until I do what I set out to do.  I know that when I first arrived in Cali I was a little skeptical and more than a little homesick, but now that I've gotten over the small period of adjustment, I remembered what I came out here for in the first place.  Now that I'm back in a regular job and things have settled down a bit, I am refocused on the task at hand.  I gave up too much to come out here to just turn around just because it's a little uncomfortable.  Admittedly, it hasn't been all that bad.  I've seen a lot of things I never would have seen otherwise.  Plus, I've gotten out of that comfort zone I called a life back home. It's time to make things happen.  I know we will.     On a semi-related...I was sitting around just thinking about some things the other day and I realized that we all know people who have now decided to move out to sunny California.  Wouldn't it be excellent if, say, three years from now we have around 50 friends and relatives who have been inspired or convinced to move out here because we decided to close our eyes, take a deep breath, and just do it on the spur of the moment.  It would definately make home seem a little closer, that's for sure.     One final note before I sign out:  I just wanted to say thank you for all of the support that we've gotten from you people out there.  The great thing is, not all of you are people that we've known for years.  Some are just people who've come across our site and just liked it.  You've all been great.  For those of you who think the site has gotten a bit routine, you have to realize, this has been our transition time.  Sure, there was plenty of interesting prose and quite a bit of emotion as we anticipated our little venture, and our excitement carried over for the our first few weeks of discovering our new surroundings.  Right now, though, we're just getting our everyday lives on track.  I know some of you are waiting to hear how we progress on 'making it in Hollywood'.  For you, I just want to say, be patient-good things are just around the corner.  To everyone else...I'll be dreaming about you tonight, baby!     For those of you movie fans out there: If you haven't yet, you should check out the preview for 'Garden State', a new movie written & directed by, and starring 'Scrubs' star, Zach Braff ( urlLink Garden State Trailer  or  urlLink Garden State Internet Exclusive Trailer ).  We think it's going to be one of the movies to catch this summer that may not get the publicity of the big blockbusters.  Give it a look-see.

      My contacts are bone dry and I'm having trouble seeing what I type. I would go to sleep, but I've spent the last forty-five minutes exporting random short clips from Amanda and I's road trip. So I have to share something. The majority of the tape is far too boring to post raw, so eventually I'll drop music behind it and make a little five minute recap. But until then:  This was the last time I saw 818. i doubt you could miss it,  urlLink but notice the ridiculous amount of junk in our front yard  we couldn't fit in the cars.  I believe this is the day before we hit California, and I saw this coming from a distance and thought it was  urlLink a little part of history .   Amanda and I had stopped on the side of the road at a look out point to stretch our legs, long story short: I thought the river was close - I was way wrong - and on the way back in the very, very, very hot desert, I almost...  urlLink well, just watch the video to find out .  Here I was trying to sneak up on the cat during it's usual afternoon nap,  urlLink but I didn't quite make it  without smashing my toe on a chair.   urlLink Now for this next clip , you have to understand just how cold the water was, during my second dive my forehead actually began to sting, it was worse than any brain freeze I've ever experienced, but it started on the outside and worked it's way past the skin. I don't know for sure why I jumped in - partly just because Chuck was complaining about the snow in Michigan on the phone and I was saying it was so hot I was going to go for a dip [mainly to rub it in]. The other part must have been stupidity. Because, wow... it was chilly.

      Billy just came into our room a few minutes ago and woke me up. Michelle decided to call me to say hi before she went to her friend's house. I can remember telling her I'd call her when I woke up, but I guess it didn't stick. Now I can't go back to sleep and I'm grumpy. This is my way of chiding Michelle for liking me.  The last few posts are just too depressing. I've been thinking about all the e-mails I've received and comments people left. I was kinda suprised at the response. To be honest, I haven't changed my mind on the subject. I still think I spend too much time in front of the computer, but I can see everyone else's angle too.  I guess I'm just going to have to learn to limit myself. My posts might be a little shorter until I can learn to edit less.  So, for today, I'm posting a comic book Billy got me for my birthday. It's James Kolchalka's version of the Hulk. The strip reminds me of when I try to act like something doesn't bother me. It's called Hulk v.s. the rain.

      I finally have a nice relaxing day off.  I think Chuck and I are going to do some running around and maybe catch an early movie.  I have to be back for the game, though.  Woo-hoo Pistons!  2-1, baby!  Two more wins and we're in the finals.  All we have to do is win our two home games.  Chuck has even grown quite fond of the playoffs.  It's pretty cool to watch him get overexcited about something he never really cared that much for, that is until he saw the Pistons in last year's playoffs, because they are, of course, awesome.  I think it maybe a pizza and Pepsi night for the game (which is on that tool of the devil...cable).  Anyway, I'm going to get out of here - stuff to do..."Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes!"

      Well, I would agree with Chuck, except...  When "caliblog" started it served a number of purposes:  1)  an easy way for all of our family and friends to keep in touch [or at least to keep tabs].  2)  it also served as a memoir [and it being 'public' also allowed our audience to lend their support].  3)  and finally, I think "caliblog" served as a watermark [not the "logo" watermark, but the "where the water used to be" watermark], a place to plainly state our goals and then as a constant reminder [both for our readers and ourselves] of our progress.   Without this blog, I believe time would pass just as easily as it has in the past,  hell ... "caliblog" has only been up and running for four months, I haven't really  done  anything [film related] in two years.  So, I'll still be posting on a regular basis. After all this entry only took fifteen minutes to write... I think the real killer of inspiration [and especially time] around the apartment is cable tv.   Any of you reading out there - please, share your thoughts on this.

      When I was working on the first issue of my magazine,  Suddenly Routine , I went to interview Mark Maynard, the creator of  urlLink Crimewave USA . Crimewave is a magazine that chronicles Mark and his wife Linette's lives since way back when they first met.  The thing that I liked the most about Crimewave was Mark got to talk about whatever he wanted, but mostly that he got to talk about himself. I thought, "Hey, I could write about me," and a magazine was born. Well, if pregnancy lasted 4 years, that is. It took me about 48 months to make the first issue.  I like telling stories, especially from my own perspective. Making a blog about going to California was like that first issue all over again. Only now the results were immediate. No publishing, no printing, and minor edits. It could all be on the web and across the world in a matter of seconds. Talk about instant gratification.   The blog can be split into three sections. Talking about leaving, the trip here, and all the things we did once we got here. After that, it was supposed to be about finding work in the entertainment industry. At first, I never wrote about it because I had too much on my mind, and I wasn't really working towards it anyway. Moving was a big enough step, and I needed some time to chill out.  Then the time started to stretch. Suddenly I'm parallel to my life in Michigan, only 2,500 miles away. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. I wasn't really doing anything that had anything to do with film. Not even filming or writing on my own. It was easier just to let time pass.  I might only elude to it in a couple posts, but I'm on here too much. I spend more time checking out the website than... well, almost anything. You can tell by my 2-second response time when it comes to comments. Not to mention site design, and all the bells and whistle we constantly add.  Billy's had a stronger stand on this than me from the beginning. Yesterday he said his last three posts might have been "Worked at Ikea today." "Worked at Ikea today." "Worked at Ikea today." Maybe he doesn't go to the beach with us as much as we'd like, but his point is still well taken. If I'd had a blog in Michigan, I can imagine it being similar to this one. Though I haven't checked to see if there is a michiblog.  Lately, I agree with Billy more and more. I know everyone likes reading about us, and what we did at the beach or work, (at least I hope you do) but this is getting out of hand. It seems like I spend more time writing about my life than living it. The irony isn't lost on me completely. A lot of crazy stuff happens where I work and it usually makes for a funny quip each morning, but that's the sort of thing I should be saving for my zine.   The blog is new and growing. I think it's important that we not lose focus on what it was supposed to become in the first place. At least what I thought it was going to become. Read the title at the top and ask yourself how often we talk about making it "in the industry", short of whining that we aren't. Well, I can only think of one remedy.   I won't be posting for a while.  Can we amalgamate and help the blog become even better? I think it's going to take a concentrated effort. We could all spend fewer hours basking in the electronic glow of our computer screens. Mike wrote, "I should be writing more... filming more... thinking & taking action more." He'd have a lot more free time if the two of us weren't obsessing over webstats and page designs. (I know Amanda wouldn't mind)  Maybe sometime down the road there'll be a mike.com, where he can be as garrulous about politics as he wants. Or a chuck.com where I can talk about how much it annoys me to photocopy things. Believe me, it won't be far off. Too many things happen when you work overnights in LA. I just want caliblog to have purpose.  Billing my credit card $9 a month doesn't make me the owner of the site. At least not in the sense that it belongs to me. If everyone disagrees, I'll simply try to stick with this goal for myself. It won't bother me if Mike, Amanda, or Billy talk about whatever they want. I'm just showing them how I feel about it. I think I know where each of them stands on the issue.   As soon as I feel like I've got it under control, and perhaps set some time limits on myself (Maynard law of blogging) I'll make a personal blog and write all about how I waste my free time out here. First I need to get away for a while.  When I do post to Caliblog, I'll make it as informing and entertaining as possible. I'm just trying to complete the goals that I've put upon myself out here. I can assure you when the day comes that I'm working as a production assistant for the next Coca-Cola commercial, I'll write about it until the cows come home. That's a promise.  For now, I need to continue my life unfettered - sans blog. If something comes up, I promise you guys will be the first to read about it.

      I was just reading some of the early post [before we had left] and found them very inspiring. Partly because we took a big chance and came out on top [despite the self-doubt fueled by certain non-supporters], but mostly because I find myself in a new and similar situation with my love for film. I know what I want to do, and I know the many roads that eventually lead there, and I know it's going to take some necessary steps and risk.   I can't help thinking: I'm not getting any younger. I've been in LA for three months and haven't  done  anything. And when I say that 'I haven't done anything', I don't mean; "what the hell -- I haven't struck it big yet", I mean "I could / should be writing more... filming more... thinking & taking action more."   Plain and simple: I want to make shorts & films, and it's going to take more than just Chuck and I [and dragging Amanda along isn't going to cut it either]. We need people who share similar goals, and we need lots of them.  Which I believe; is where "co.op films" comes into play. I have a lot of work ahead of me, and I don't even know exactly where to begin. I started to write a "mission statement" [you might call it]:     co.op films is as it says: cooperative film-making . Our goal is simple, seek out aspiring minds in film, whether those aspirations lie in screenwriting, marketing, or any and every step in-between.   All volunteers are rotated, allowing :    * everyone to eventually show their talent    * volunteers to take on large projects when they have time or assist when they don't   * to create a team environment where no one is at the top of the ladder for too long    My hope is that co.op films will grow in size and therefore creativity, but in the meantime [as exercises] recreate unique and challenging scenes from inspirational films. I personally am I huge fan of long-shots [John Frankenheimer / P.T. Anderson / Martin Scorsese], and would love to take on all the complications of a three to four minute long-shot.   Anyways, I didn't get on here to write about any of this, and now it's very late and I have a long day ahead of me tomorrow [my brother's graduation ceremony], so it's time I call it a night.

      I meant to post this last night, but it wouldn't upload. But better late than never, Nick and I helped Mandy and her friend, Kelsey  urlLink make a video about dairy for school . It's not done but I thought I would show it anyways. Enjoy.

         I don't have anything to post today, but since I'm going to be a little more active on this site from now on, I was just curious what kind of things you folks out there think we could do to improve Caliblog.  Let us know.  Until then, don't go outside...

      What I never mentioned about the  urlLink Past the Breaking Point   short was that Mike and I had actually spent the night in the car the day before the shoot. We were in downtown Ann Arbor the night before, and I guess we decided it would be easier to go to sleep than to go home.  We only got a couple hours sleep in my metro (a very small car) which was parked at the top of the parking garage. That's the same place we filmed a lot of it. I'm still a little suprised the cops never showed up, with me running around waving a gun over my head. The spot's visibility is pretty good over the city.  Needless to say, we were all acting a little silly. A lot of it wasn't recorded to tape, but a lot of it was. So for this weekly movie, we've decided to release the Past the Breaking Point blooper reel. I hope it can make everyone a little bit happier, this being the middle of the work week.   For those of you who didn't see the original, I suggest you watch it before you look at the blooper reel. Otherwise none of it will make any sense.  urlLink Right Click  & "save as" for slower computers. For those of you with DSL, it should pull up reasonably fast. It's about 5.3mb. I promise it's worth it. If you don't believe me, here's a screenshot.     Now that that's out of the way, I present to you,  urlLink Past the Breaking Point: The Blooper Reel .

      I mentioned the other day that blog was getting a little on the 'pictureless' side, so I walked around today and snapped a handful of boring pictures to share with the world. How exciting.      Above: Usually this creek [the famous Onsted Creek] is bone dry, but MI has been getting lots of rain lately [none so far since I've been here]. Once in a blue moon this bridge is under a good foot of water, and I have some fond memories from cross of people not quite making it across.      Above: Here's the messy one in the family [Amanda should think that's funny].       Above: I don't know what the hell this thing, but it scares me.      Above: this is the old trail I used to run during my four years of cross. I wonder how many times I've run up and down this trail... I image I easily put in over a thousand miles on this dirt path. Good times.      Above: Just a random tree in the woods that runs along the trail.   Well, that's all for now. I have more, but I'm at my mom's place, and she still hasn't moved on from 56k... so yeah... these few pictures took me a while to upload. But I will be on again later with some more pictures and a video or two. Adios.

      Just before my shift was over today, a guy came in that seemed to be in a hurry. He asked if I could help him with some color copies, but did the typical thing. i.e. waited for me to do it for him. He kept telling me what he wanted done, but wouldn't actually do it. He'd just stare at me like I was his personal assistant.   Typically, I'll tell people they'll have to place an order, but I was almost out of there, so I thought what the hell. By the end, I'd done about $15 of work, had he placed an order with us. The whole time with him correcting me and talking about how outrageous our prices were.  The pictures he was copying were of him and some baseball players. He was an umpire. I goofed one of the copies, and as we went to get him his change, he told me I could keep it. I saw the baseball players in the picture, so I asked "Anyone famous?". I think he thought I meant him. So he asked me what my name was, took a pen and signed the picture. He'd been so angry the whole time, I was sure it would say "To the worst customer service rep ever". Instead, he opted for "Be safe always. God bless."  I laminated it.    p.s. Does anyone know who these guys are?  I slept about 12 hours yesterday. Really because I didn't have anything better to do. I went to bed at 10 and just kept going back to sleep. By the time I finally got up, it was time to go to work. I think this could be an excellent device for saving money, while simeltaneously grounding my social life into a fine powder.   Being at a job where you only see one of two people each night makes it a little more difficult. My interactions with co-workers are polite and minimal. It's not that we don't laugh and have a good time, but we're not going clubbing together anytime soon. Though, I never clubbed in the first place. (Maybe a couple baby seals)   So I've decided to start college here. I know it probably won't be cheap at first, but I'm only going to enroll for a couple classes. This should be a good way to increase my network within the business, and get a social circle. I'd like to meet some other Californians with film interests. Imagine that, I'm a Californian now.  I'm not sure where I'll attend, so I'm open to suggestions, if anyone has them. It has to be sorta close to Hollywood. Film school would be good. I guess I'll go check that out now.

      I'm out of shape. I went with Nick to his "easy day" of track practice [assuming that we would go for a run down the old trail]. Instead; we play a game of ultimate, which I was excited about, until I got the frisbee twice in a row. And in Cross & Track we run until tagged, so I'm out-running a handful of high school sprinters and long distant runners from one end of the football field to the other. Ugh. My lungs are good and stretched. But it was fun, and good for the soul. I'm just not looking forward to waking up tomorrow.  Then Nick and I helped Mandy and her friend film & edit their class project. I will probably post it here as soon as it's wrapped up. That was a lot of fun, and alot of out-takes [they got a bad case of the giggles]. I think the commercial is maybe two minutes max, and we have 30 minutes of footage... 25 minutes of it just laughing.  I found this on the news today and  urlLink thought it was "laugh out loud" funny . Apparently it took a "think tank" to realize that Bush's war in Iraq allowed Al Qaeda to re-group and become stronger. Is this funny to anyone else out there? I could go on for paragraphs why it's so comical but no one reads the blogs if they get too lengthy [and not mention, pictureless].  Which reminds me; I need to borrow my dad's digital camera. I realized skimming through the current post, that there are a total of three pictures. That's just sad. And Chuck, if you're reading this: can you update the weekly movie :) Please.  I wanted to mention something that I think would be far more satisfying and fulfilling than any award or nomination anyone could ever give you. At the Cannes Film Festival this year, Michael Moore's film, "Fahrenheit 911", received the longest standing ovation any film has ever received in the history of the festival. It was reported as being 15 to 25 minutes long. Now, say what you want about Michael Moore, but that's one hell of an achievement. Wonder if I'll ever recieve a standing ovation? Hmm... something to shoot for.

      Well another one of us has joined the Ikea team. I just accepted a job offer and made the appointment for my drug test. I have some time to kill before my appointment to pee in a cup, but not enough to drive to Jill's and back so I came back to the apartment to tell you all about it. I'm getting a dollar more than at Toys R Us but it's only a part time position (1-19 hours a week) so I'll still be at TRU two mornings a week. Unfortunately I'll be working on the opposite end of the building from Mike.  I'm house/dog sitting for Jill this week (I'll write in further detail about this later). She's a soap opera director. She has a gorgeous house in Silver Lake, with an amazing view and a really lovely dog named Peaches. She doesn't have internet and my cell doesn't get a good signal out there, so I feel a bit secluded, but it's OK.   It only sucks because Mike left for MIchigan today and I can't instant message him or call him very easily. It's really pretty retarded how sad I get when he leaves. I know we see each other all the time. This actually will probably do us some good; absence makes the heart grow fonder, you know.  My mom and Ray were here to visit for a couple of days last week. It was great to spend some time with them and show them our apartment and around LA. It made me feel so proud (like "mommy, look what I did!"). Now they are in New Zealand, for an entire month! I'm so jealous.  On Friday MIke and I went to see a play, called 'Jerry and Tom', just around the corner, at the Whitmore Lindley Theatre. It stars a good friend of mine, Dennis Cockrum. He is a great actor. The play is about two hit-men; it's funny. We had a good time. If you live in the LA area you should go see it, it plays through the end of June.  (i wrote this yesterday as "mike"... oops)

        When I was in the supermarket yesterday, Donal Logue was in line in front of me.  If you don't know, he's the star of 'Grounded For Life'.  If you still don't know, go to  urlLink Donal Logue's profile @ IMDB .  He's been in about 60+ movies.  It was pretty cool.   Real quick...I saw 'Shrek 2' last Thursday.  If you like the first one, you'll love the second.  Thumbs up, baby.  I know I should be putting this in Caliblog: Reviews, but no one ever reads them, so what's the point?   And how about them Pistons?  Huh?  YEAH, BABY!!!  Three home games to go!  Well, that's all for now.

      I'm operating on two hours of sleep, and suffering from jet-lag; I'm feeling a bit out of it.   It feels so strange to be posting from Michigan again. I want to go walk around with a video camera and get some footage of just how small Onsted really is... but a) it's dark outside now, and b) I might fall asleep mid-step.  The flight went well, except for a twenty minute delay due to a plane parked behind us that was "experiencing technical difficulties". I didn't get to sit by the window as I had anticipated [that must be my flight home], so I didn't get much footage of the view. I was only able to sneak two shots (  urlLink shot one  |  urlLink shot two  ) as the person to my left went to the bathroom [I don't think he was very fond of flying]. Sorry they are not very exciting, I think he waited till there was nothing to look at to get up and leave.  Eyes... getting... heavy. Must... sleep.

      Two girls left a giant photo album in the store a couple days ago. I put it in the 'lost and found' with all the other stuff. Nobody claimed it for a couple days, so James and I started to look through it. The girls inside were pretty cute. For another day, no one claimed the photo album, then I got a call today from a mom looking for it. She sent her daughter in to retrieve it.   Now there are two versions of this story. One from my perspective and another from my manager's. So here it goes.  Girl: Hi, is Chuck here? Cathy: You a friend of his? Girl: It's who my mom told me to ask for. Chuck: Can I help you? Girl: We left a photobook here the other day. Chuck: Wallet size, about three pictures? Girl: (frowns) Chuck: Kidding. Yeah we have it. (gets book) We were wondering when someone was coming in. Girl: Thanks. Chuck: Yup.  That's how I thought it happened, but apparently there was a lot more smiling and giggling in the beginning; and the end went something a little more like this.  Chuck: We were wondering when someone was coming in. Girl: Yeah we couldn't-- Chuck: Ok, bye. (turns around)  So this girl was trying to flirt with me and I cut her off. Cathy said she was smiling the whole time, which apparently went right over my head. Once again, according to her, I went so far as to turn around before she finished her sentence. I remember nothing of the sort.  Not that it really matters, but am I  that  oblivious? Am I too stupid to notice? Are the rest of you guys like me? My curiosity is peaked. So send in your comments. Our phone lines are open.

      I spent last night with Amanda at Jill's. Internet-less. It was good and bad; good because it let me spend more time thinking and writing, but on the bad side; I wanted to write a post really bad... and had to tough it out until she came back with the car. I started writing the breakdown for co.op films; how it works, who is who... and so on.  I'm a little fuzzy on my schedule, but I think I might not have another opportunity to write again until I get into MI. Unless of course I can find a the little do-hicky I need for my laptop so I can plug a phone-line into it and install AOL for a week, then I should be able to, which reminds me; I need to look for that.   Peaches, Jill's dog, is really cool. While playing with her though, I accidentally threw one of her toys on the roof. I had a blue chew toy with little red balls on it and I was running around the back yard getting her chase and jump after me, when I decided I would stop faking her out and really toss it up in the air, but when I let go of it, it went flying behind me and disappeared on the roof, Peaces gave me a very disapproving head tilt. Apparently I'm not very good at tossing things straight up. So, I go back through the house and out the front door and find it laying in some ground cover. Now, I'm apparently smart enough to leave the door cracked open (in case it automatically locked... it was a strange old door), but when I'm walking back up the stairs with the toy I slip and pull just enough before pushing, and the door clicks. It's 9:30, Amanda doesn't come home until 11:30 and I just locked myself out. But long [and boring] story short, I let myself back in... (I would tell you how... but Amanda thinks it's a bad idea), and stopped tossing Peaches's toys in the air.  Okay, I have to leave for work soon and I'm starving. So, till that day.

      I was just thinking how in a few days; I fly back to MI for a week to catch my bro's graduation, and I was looking forward to killing time on the plane by taping out the window, but my little camera is all funked up and won't turn on. But I don't want to bring my big camera on the plane... and this wouldn't be a problem except a check for past editing work I did is two months overdue... it's a long story and I'm just venting. I really wanted to post some footage of view out my window as I was leaving LAX. And I think flying above the clouds is the most relaxing and eye-opening place to be.  While I'm off in MI, Amanda gets to dog / house-sit in Silver Lake for our [well... Amanda's friend... she's not  really  my friend... anyways] friend, Jill, who is a tv director... which is hot, I mean cool... or both? No... I've said too much. Crap. Well... I wanted to write alot more, but we have free seats for a play starting tonight and I have a few things to take care of before then. I'll write more tonight when I get back in [if I'm feeling lazy].

      We have a program that shows us all the different websites that have direct links to ours, or to files on our site. For some reason, a girl with an account at  urlLink livejournal  has linked to one of our strangest videos. It's called Chuck feet. We were at the beach and I shot some video of my feet in two little puddles while Mike debated the next shot.  At first I thought they had some weird foot fetish. The last thing I wanted was someone fantasizing about my feet. I went and checked the site and it seemed harmless. Though in her post she doesn't say a word about the video, just provides the link. Frankly, I'm still confused.  Last night I suggested we all go to the Santa Monica pier. I just felt like I needed to see the ocean at night. When we got there a bunch of kids were walking on the beach after their prom. There were guys in tuxedos and girls in giant billowy dresses walking up and down the beach, trying to keep the bottoms of their gowns from scraping the sand.  The ocean is so beautiful at night. You stand on the end of the pier, about 15 feet above the waves in what would be complete darkness without the lamps they have on at night. Then the water snakes up from out of nowhere and rolls underneath you towards the coast. It looks like someone sliding a giant rolling pin underneath a piece of silk.  On the way back to the car, Mike was assaulted for the second time in California. Someone in a red car threw a blueberry at his neck to entertain themselves. [Previously he'd been shot with a water pistol while driving in Hollywood]. I don't know how he aggravates these attacks, but I haven't had any problems yet. Before we hit the highway we saw a cop with two guys on the sidewalk that had been driving a red car. We're pretty sure it was them.   I skipped my prom, so here's a picture of the only prom I ever went to. [R-L: Chuck, Andy, Mike, Pete, & Joe] I never liked the hyped dances. I wish we'd been at the beach.

       first day off  Well, it's been six days but I finally have a day off to myself where I can relax. I'm not used to that kind of non-stop schedule [I know; I'm a baby]. I'm reading a book right now a friend from work lent to me; 'Che Guevara - a revolutionary life'. I'm not that far into it, and so far it's reading a bit like a high school history book, but I was warned about that and reassured that it gets much better. I realized I didn't know much of anything about Che, but the person who lent me the book said that he is her hero, and that she has read the book three times [and you can tell by looking at the book... it's seen better days].     Above: Here's a pic that should have been posted months ago, we are at the top of a Santa Monica parking structure.   I have some imported footage from Amanda and I's trip out here that I'm going to post on here soon, I would do it now, but we are reaching our max-bandwidth limits [again]. So I will just wait till the month resets. I have almost an hour of footage so I'll have to break it up, and I want to put a short clip of our beta fish, Adam, who just recently passed :( He somehow jumped up and out of his fish bowl and he was found dried up on the floor in our bedroom. Very strange. Chuck and Amanda said their goodbyes and flushed him down the toilet while I was at work.  Oh, while I'm thinking about it; does anyone out there know how to take basically a lamp and make it run off of batteries? Do I just use a ac/dc converter? Can I just cut off the plug and connect the wires to a battery? Does this all sound crazy? Chuck and I were discussing filming something at night, and I want to make what would basically be a boom-mic and make a boom-lite... so to speak. I'm just not much of an electrician.

       THE HIGHEST MOVIE EVER  So, yesterday I went to see a movie at the Beverly 13, which is in this HUGE mall.  I think it may actually border Beverly Hills (thus the name).  The theater is on the 8th story of this gargantuan building.  When you first get off the elevator, you actually get light headed from being up so high.  Basically, 'Macy's' and 'Bloomingdales' take up most of the bottom of the mall and the 'regular' mall stores (still the high end stores, though) take up the top three floors.  There's no escalators connecting these top floors to the bottom floors.  They're separated by an elevator, to keep the riff-raff unseen.  While I was there, though, I did see one of my favorite actors, Michael Keaton.  He just walked right by me.  Well, he strutted, really.  It was cool.  After that, in the hallway of the theater, I saw WWF's (or whatever they call it nowdays) star, Chris Jericho.  He was by himself talking on his cell-phone.  I'm not really a 'talk to celebrities' kind of guy, so I didn't say anything to either one.  I would just rather leave them to their business.  Anyway, that's all for now.  Till next time...don't get pregnant!!!

       stuck  There's a computer lab where I work that's open all night. After midnight we only have one or two people on computers. Usually a homeless person will be passed out at the laptop station. They leave the customers alone, so we leave them alone.   Last night my manager pointed out a woman I hadn't seen before. She was asian and looked about mid-forties, but didn't seem to really fit the profile. Her clothes still looked pretty clean and her bag seemed to be well kept. She was sleeping with her head on one of the desks, and my manager told me she'd done the same the night before. Obviously she hadn't just randomly nodded off.  I didn't think much about it until about 4am when she walked up to the counter. In between yawns she told us that she'd lost her wallet on a bus with her passport and ID inside. She tried to get it back, but it was gone by the next stop. They wouldn't let her rent a hotel since she didn't have any picture ID. I thought about making her a fake one.  She asked if the cops would "put her up" if she went to see them. I told her I wasn't sure. She told us she didn't have any family or friends in the area. I wonder how often people get stuck halfway around the world. I mean I know at that point I would have gone to an embassy, but maybe there was some reason she couldn't.   I'll probably see her again tonight. If she talks to me again, I'll try and find some directions to the embassy for her. When she left this morning she waved and mouthed 'goodbye'. She smiled almost like nothing was wrong.   I hope it's optimism.  I hope she finds her way home.

       careful, you might get muddy  In an attempt to balance my bad habit of sitting infront of the computer I am forcing myself to do little exercises before getting on either the laptop or the mac. I was doing 20 push-ups and 20 crunches, but after the fifth time sitting down I wussed out and decided to 10 push ups and 20 crunches. I think it's a good habit to try and form. I feel better already; less wasteful.  Now just to stop drinking so much pop... oh, sorry [I'm from Michigan], I mean soda.   Well, I would write more but I'm going to search around on eBay for an SLR camera and some special lens to test out  urlLink mini35 . I don't have any money to buy the things I'm looking for... but, what the hell.

       the day's assignments  I got stuck with the job of collating pages for a book last night. For those of you unfamiliar with the term, collating is taking thousands of sheets of paper that are too glossy to be sorted by a machine and putting them into piles, sheet by sheet. Stacks [111] [222] and [333] become [1,2,3] [1,2,3] [1,2,3]. It really sucks.  And it doesn't really require a lot of thought. So I'd grab a stack off the top, wipe my index finger and thumb on a wet sponge, and slowly build 30 or 40 books. About 20 pages per book, plus covers. [You do the math.]   About halfway in, I wasn't even thinking about collating anymore. My mind was wandering so much, that I realized I hadn't thought about collating in twenty minutes.  Buddhists practice the art of awareness. Awareness isn't nirvana or blankness of mind, it's just what it says; plainly, being aware. Mainly of your surroundings. Buddha said that none of us are really ever living in the present, because we're either thinking of the past or the future. What's happened or what's going to happen.  I've been reading up on it for a couple months, and I've got to say being aware is tough. Especially for someone as frazzled as myself. For one thing, I don't think I go five minutes a day without singing a song in my head. I always have at least one tune in my head all day; if not several. And usually I'm singing them, instead of just thinking about it.   I try to be aware of my surroundings. Instead of thinking of everything around me, I look at it and think of nothing. [I guess that's where the blankness, if any, comes into if for me.]  I think the first big step is taking in what's actually physically around you. Most of the time, we're only aware of the things very close to us. For instance, a computer screen. A girlfriend. The television. Try for a moment to imagine yourself in the room you are in, beyond what surrounds you within a foot. Just picture in your head the layout of the room and all the objects and people within it.  Now indulge your mind for a moment and think only of the present. Not what you're going to eat today, or what happened at work yesterday. Just you and the computer screen. Homogeney.  Now think of nothing. Hell, give your mind a rest for a moment or two.   Remember, inner peace is choice. Begin within.

       3 minutes left  I woke up this morning to find the power cord for the laptop missing; I am assuming Amanda did something with it, I don't know what is going on there. But anyways; the battery meter says I've only got three minutes left... but it also says it has 85% left. So, we'll see if I actually get to post this entry before my computer shuts off.   I took my contacts out to soak them for the first time in over a month. I know that's all very interesting, but I just thought I would share.  I got an email back regarding an internship last night after work. The funny thing is; I can't figure out which post it was on the list. None of the information he gave me in the email matches anything or anyone on the list. His "Internet Movie Data Base" file is pretty bare, that didn't lead me to any clues. So, I'll just have to call and pretend I know which one he is. I would post a link to his info but I don't know it would come back to haunt me. So, I'll hold off on that.  Oh, I mentioned a few post ago we were considering changing the look of the site [again], I've been editing the templete on another blog to make sure everything worked before switching out caliblog's current style. But I thought why not see what our readers think about the change. Now keep in mind,  urlLink it's not complete done yet , but generally; do you think we should make the change?

       38 faxes later  Okay, I just rolled out of bed, it's "noon-thirty" and I have to be at work in less than two hours, so bare with me on this post.     I spent three hours last night standing at a fax machine. Well, that's not completely true [but my neck is still killing me]; first I spent about twenty minutes going through the six pages of fine print and highlighting the internship post that only left fax numbers [and not emails], then I grabbed a tall stack of 'cover sheets' and started filling them out as neatly as I could with my hand-writing. Then, an hour later: using two fax machines at once, I dialed number after number, sending resume after resume. I was actually quite impressed with my speed and efficiency, I had marked a check by each of the 'intern' postings that I had made a cover sheet for, and when it went through the machine, I circled the check and organized the conformation print-outs, all before the fax machine even finished dialing.  I was afraid that the people within earshot were going to snap and strangle me, I think the only noise that filled the room for an hour plus, was the sound of two fax machine dialing numbers one after another, followed by the random beeping and humming of the line being picked up on the other end. Besides that; it was dead silent.  My plan was to wake up today, and finish what I started last night, by emailing the rest of listings, but I slept in, I'm sure getting back at two in the morning and then laying wide awake in bed for three hours didn't help. So I guess I will have to pick up where I left when I get back from work.

       Target...no more!    Well, I just got home from my last day at Target.  I didn't stay the whole day.  What would be the point?  Instead, I'm just going to go to IKEA and work tonight.  It wasn't sad at all, I just wanted out.  I think I said all of my goodbyes to MY Target back in Michigan.  That was where my heart was.  That's where my "family" was.  This one was just a temporary lay-over.  But now that's over.  It's all on and up from here.      I bought my 'Friends:  The Finale' DVD this week.  I actually thought it was better than the televised version.  Funnier and more emotional.  I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.  For those of you who don't like 'Friends'-shut up!    Now that I'm down to one job again, once I get settled in, I can start working on some other things like I had planned.  At some point I would like to start a regular comic strip on here.  Of course, if I post it like I post my entries, it may take a while to get to the punchlines.  From this point on, you'll be seeing a lot more of me and what I'm up to.  I'm not making any promises (I don't make promises), but you can count on it.  Trust me...   Oh, and for anyone who is looking forward to seeing more about Pixar's new animated feature  urlLink The Incredibles , here's the newly released full trailer for the movie.  Enjoy.

       what I came here for  I'm finally going to start applying for PA positions this week. I've been meaning to do it since I came here, but I didn't know where to start. My manager at work has done some PA work in the area and she gave me a website that's apparently really good. All I have to do is make up my resume and start sending it out. I'm sure my first job won't be paid, but that's no big deal. I've got to start somewhere. Working overnight is finally going to pay off. I'll be able to do PA gigs during the day.  I haven't made a very good effort yet, but I'm giving myself a month deadline. Maybe now the site will actually have some content about me trying to make it in film, instead of what I've blown up in the freezer or what new landlord I'm hiding from.  I feel like I'm ready now. It's time to get started.

       blah, blah, blah  Blogger's new look has me inspired to waste a few days away staring at the computer screen re-designing the site. Anyways; thanks for the positive comments on  urlLink the new weekly movie , sorry it took so long... I've been a little under the gun with Bye Bye Birdie... I thought my work was done when I realized the widescreen bars were blinking red and green; that was another 32 hours of exporting alone... not to mention the hour it took to fix and the 8 hours of rendering time. Ugh. Anyone out there want to buy me a shiny new G5? No. Okay.  I don't have much to write about [as you have probably noticed by now] but I just wanted to let you all know I'm still alive. Well, Chuck and I are going to play a game over worm's world party now. So, I guess you all see where you rank. Goodnight world.  ps. I would like to say that 'caliblog' has hit it's first 1,000 + watermark for [monthly] unique visitors, and not to mention it's only the 12th. I dunno' who all you people are. But, thank you for finding your way to our humble little site, and making us feel special. And speaking of record numbers: "past the breaking point" hit over 50 downloads in it's first day. Too bad we can't turn some kinda' profit off that, we could all quit our jobs and make silly movies once a week.

       Chuck acting?  Mike said I could introduce the next weekly movie. I wanted to do the intro, because he seems to have featured me prominently in the final cut. I made this short while I was at community college. We never quite finished it, so it became a preview instead of a whole film. I think it stands well as a preview.     Here's the movie. I suggest you right click and download it, for the best preview.  urlLink Past the Breaking Point   p.s. If it gives you audio problems for about 20 seconds, please keep watching. I don't know why it's doing that, but it stops eventually.

      I've never counted, but we call the weather here "perfect" a lot. It's an easy thing to say, because the weather never deviates much from what a midwesterner would call perfect. The beach is cool and temperate, the mountains look like a beautiful painting, the trees bloom flowers of pink and purple, and the sun is always bright and shining.  And somehow, negating all that, the most beautiful thing in my life just got on a plane and flew away from me.  I took Michelle to the airport, expecting her to cry. She'd already teared up last night at the thought of leaving. I told her all morning that I was going to make her late on purpose. I almost did it accidentally [she got there 45 minutes before the flight]. To her credit, she never even got misty until right before I couldn't walk with her anymore. We got to the checkpoint where I couldn't go, and the tears started to collect in the corners of her eyes.   I never even got misty when she was hugging me. Maybe it was just that I hadn't let her go yet. Even if it wasn't going to last very long. Then I had to watch her get on an escalator and be taken away from me.   She looked beautiful this morning.  An escalator is perhaps the worst way to watch someone leave you. Instead of staring at the floor and occassionally looking at their back, you have to match eyes, and watch them get smaller and smaller, on the world's slowest moving mechanical device.   The moment lasted a long time. Too long, because I had to keep sniffing deep to keep from looking like an idiot and crying in public. She finally waved and turned at the top and I wandered out of the airport, upset and half-blind. With no idea where I left my car. After 15 minutes of wandering I finally found it.  I can't think of a way to wrap this up, except to say that California isn't the same without her.

       IT'S JUST BILLY, CHECKING IN...     Well how is everybody in cyberspace doing?  I know it's been, like, a month since my last real post.  I make no excuses...    So let's see...since I last posted what has happened? Did I mention I saw Thomas Jane and Rebecca Romijn (Stamos) at 'The Punisher' premiere?  I don't remember.  Since then, I've just been working a lot.  I actually have taken a job with IKEA, so when my two weeks are up at the end of this week, it's 'bye-bye Target', at least for now.  Right now I'm trying to work both jobs, but this week I may lay off.  I needed the extra money.  A new 'Marx Bros.' box set came out this week and a Universal monsters one came out last week.  I've got to have my movies.    To tell the truth, there really hasn't been much to write about.  I'm fairly insocial and haven't been out and about too much.  I finally got my drawing table dug out, so I will start working on some things, and I WILL be posting regularly again.  You can count on that.   Give me a couple more weeks, though.  Once I'm actually more settled in on my new job, it will time to get out there and see what I can get into.  Maybe see what it takes to get into pimping.  That seems like an easy way to make a little extra cash.    Like I said before, not much has happened.  That's basically why I haven't posted.  Heck, I almost fell asleep writing this one, myself.  Take it easy for now and I'll be back.  ---Oh, by the way, if you get time check out the new  urlLink Spider-Man 2 Trailer  It's pretty sweet.

       happy mother's day (cont'ed)    Well, Chuck beat me to it [I knew I should have posted a "happy mother's day" entry last night... oh well]. Here's a picture of my mom, she just finished up her nursing classes, and she is going to kill me posting this picture on the internet. He he. I love you, mom. I'm so proud of you for kicking ass in school and becoming a nurse. I miss you and wish I was rich enough to fly back home for some mother's day diner... or send a few dozen flowers... but I suck and my pockets are empty.           Below: Here's a pic from the last time I saw my mom; the night before Amanda and I left Ypsi. It was a sad night... very hard to say goodbye.     Happy Mother's Day.

So for all the mom's out there, we love you. I love you, mom. Here's a picture of her. Kevin Trickey [my godfather] took it, when she was a teenager I guess.

       slideshow  People always seem to like it when we post pictures... and looking at the site; I see it's been a while [not counting Amanda's last post - because that's artwork... not a picture]. So, to even things out: here's a crap load of pictures. Enjoy.     Above: Today [or I guess it would be 'yesterday by now] we went for a walk under the Santa Monica Pier.      Above: "Gotta love that traffic on the 405". But I do have to say for once we managed to make good time coming north... usually it's the other way around - which is funny because I made Chuck drive back since I didn't feel like driving in stop and go traffic... and was fine all the way home. I guess I just have bad luck.      Above: That's Billy's toe... and yes; it's broke. He nailed on Michelle's suitcase [I don't know how because her suitcase is way out of the way from any path we ever take... poor Billy] while getting ready for work the other morning. Ouch.      Above: Yes that is what it looks like; Chuck riding on the handle-bars while I pedal. And yes; we know how gay it looks... but we couldn't help it. It was funny. There's also video of it that will on here soon.      Above: Here's Amanda looking cute in the backseat on the way back from Santa Monica.      Above: No that's not a statue. That's a 6 1/2 foot tall black man painted head to toe in silver. After I snapped a picture he walked up to me and I gave him some cash and a 'caliblog.com' business card... ha ha - I'm a dork, I know. He had one of those 'whistle-fan' things in his mouth... I don't know the name for them. But he shook my hand and puffed his cheek's out really far and then made a loud strange noise, and it took me a second to realize what he was doing. You couldn't see the thing in his mouth... but yeah... anyways. That's Santa Monica for you.      Above: Chuck found this on the beach on the walk back to the car. He then started throwing them at me. He said, "How often do you get the opportunity to throw birth-control pills at someone"? I guess he has a point.      Above: "Hey look... palm trees". That's all there really is to say.      Above: These banners hang all up and down Magnolia, I just thought they were cool. I don't know why I picked a banner that was half hidden behind messes of power lines, but, you get the idea.      Above: And one more of the pier; I couldn't decide which I liked better, so here's the second one. You be the judge. The sunset looks so cool cutting through the wood stands.   Well, that's definitely a crap load of pictures. I kinda' knocked the last post Amanda and I wrote off, but that's okay, just don't forget they're down there. Seems like I was going to mention something else, but I can't remember what "that" was. Probably because it's late and I'm tired and starting to nod off while sitting here. Good night cruel world.

       begin within  I don't know how many of you notice; but Chuck randomly changes the "title" of our site every few days. I think I like the current title the best "begin within". Although "caligblog: taste just like it smells... delicious", is defiantly a close second.  Okay... straight to the point: I just wanted to post a few short clips. I like  urlLink this clip Chuck shot of his feet , I don't know what he was doing... but it's gets funnier every time I see it. And here is  urlLink Chuck and Michelle walking on the beach  [in front of the same rocks I was standing on when I almost lost my camera due a sudden tidal wave]. And I have more... but I'm gonna make ya' wait.

       Whenever I despair, I remember that the way of truth and love has always won.  I just ordered Thai food. Steamed spring rolls and tom yum soup for me, orange chicken for Mike. It should be hear in about 35 min. Not that we don't have food, I'm just to tired to cook.   We just got back from Santa Monica (Chuck, Michelle, Mike and I; Billy "doesn't go to the beach"). That's the best thing about my job; most of the time I get out so early I have the whole day to do whatever I want. This morning when I got home Mike was still in bed so I actually got to crawl back in with him to cuddle (my head on his chest, my leg over his leg, listening to his heartbeat while his chest hair tickles my nose; that's my meditation). I have to get up at 5 am every morning, but that's ok. I still stay up late, and I usually don't nap, so by the 3rd or 4th day in a row I'm pretty tired. This week I'm working 7 days in a row. Bummer.   I'm listening to a CD that I made from Mike's computer in the living room so that I could have some good music to listen to in the bedroom. The song playing now is a song by Mike's brother, Nick. It's just an instrumental guitar song that he wrote. I love it. It's so beautiful and relaxing. You're the coolest, Nick. It still blows me away that girls aren't chasing him down in the hallways of his school. I don't understand it.  Another really cool thing about working where I work is that every morning I drive strait toward a horizon of mountains. Breathtaking. The past 2 days I've left just at sunrise. Gorgeous pink and blue sky turning the horizon into a mountainous silhouette.  Our landlord hasn't said anything else to Mike about the number of people staying here but we have been trying to stay on the down low until Chuck is officially on the lease (Mike is planning to make a call to the landlord on Monday about that). I haven't had any problems lately, like Chuck, but it does suck not being able to come and go, to your own home, as you please. I can't bring in my own groceries or take my laundry to the washer when I want, can't check the mail- hell, I can't even  get  my mail here anymore (I had to get a P.O. box), and worst of all, I can't eat breakfast on the balcony any more. Yeah... it sucks.  Last Saturday Tricia and I went to see Gannon's new house in Silver Lake. It's a really cool old house from the 30s. I like it a lot. We had to go up some crazy tall hills to get to it. Good thing we were in Thurmon's Lexus 'cause my little escort never would've made it. I mean it, it's hard to explain but it felt like we were going strait up and when we would get to the top (the top of every hill was also an intersection) we literally had to lift up out of our seats to look over the hood of the car to even see if there was a road in front of us or if it just dropped right off. It was very scary, to say the least.   After checking out Gannon's place we went out to lunch at a cool little restaurant in her neighborhood. They got huge borritos and I got a great homemade veggie burger. We had a really good talk, that I'd desperately been needing to have (nothing specific, just intelligent girl conversation). Then we walked down the street to check out some antique stores and a really cool (well hidden) ceramic tile store. It was a good day.  I love L.A. Everyday is a new experience. I feel like I could live here for 20 years and still not see all that L.A. has to offer. Pasadena is awesome too. Things here are very new and different. That was my reason for coming in the first place; I just didn't want to spend my whole life in the same place. I want to see the world. I only have one life, I want to make it count.        Above is a great collage Chuck made for me as a "thank you" card after his birthday the first year we met. It's very important to me. "Begin within" came from a sticker I bought for Chuck from a book store in Santa Monica the 2nd week  Mike and I were here, still waiting for Chuck and Billy to arrive in CA. I liked the way it sounded, It made me think of Chuck, and his constant search.

       bumper to bumper  I hit a taxi while we [Amanda, Chuck, Michelle, and I] we're in Santa Monica. I think it was my first collision with a car ever. I've hit some trees and put my car into a ditch or two, but never another car. I say "collision", but really it was a nudge. I slowly moved forward and touched bumpers at like .3 miles an hour. Traffic was starting to slowly move when the light changed (or so I thought) and at the same time I heard a woman screaming for her dog to come back, and I thought, "Oh crap, that ladies dog just ran into traffic". And I don't know why, or what I was thinking; but I turned my head a little to look at the woman and heard Amanda half-yell, "Mike"! And before she got out: --ke; I heard a loud hollow "Thump".  How embarrassing. Then the woman who was yelling after her dog, starting yelling at me to "not give him any money... don't give him anything... hold on... let me come over there". And the guy who was driving the taxi was telling her to mind her own business. Not to mention he wasn't asking me for anything. And all the while I can't get in a word to ask him if he is okay. Traffic is backed up on all sides by on lookers. But finally the crazy woman left and the driver just asked me to ask the woman in the back seat if she was okay. I didn't even realize she was there until he said something, she looked like she had just come from LAX and was dead-tired from a long flight, she nodded that she was perfectly fine, and I said I was sorry and we all jumped back in our cars. It sucked.

       living conditions  Kevin asked me how our landlord situation is going. I'll answer for anyone who's curious. "Not well." I had a run in with the manager next door who sputtered at Michelle and I in broken english that we could only stay one night a month. At least I think that's what he was saying. More and more I feel like a prisoner in my own apartment. I sneak out the side for work each night so the managers won't see me and sneak back in each morning.   I feel alone on it now since Amanda got a parking space behind the apartment. It's ten feet from our stairwell, so getting in and out is pretty easy. I've had to resort to parking a block away, just so I can come in from the south entrance. This is getting ridiculous. If someone doesn't at least try to get me on the lease soon I'm going to walk up to the manager's apartment and introduce myself. At least I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.  I'm already 2,500 miles away from home and I feel like I can't even walk onto my back porch. I find myself steering clear of the large bay doors when the blinds are open. I feel like I'm in witness protection.   I finally understand how they catch those criminals that have been hiding out for years and slipped up by going to a bowling alley or a shooting range. The poor bastards just couldn't take it anymore.

       you blew it up, damn you  I don't have to work tomorrow. Thank the Lord above. Although I do have to fix the video track for Bye Bye Birdie... the widescreen bars started blinking red about 30 min's into it. Grrr. And not to mention I need to put a new video for the "weekly movie" - which is a few days over due. Holly crap... I'm typing this post on Chuck's laptop, and this thing gets hot; my palms are starting to sweet. That's attractive.  We finally have food to eat! After we [Amanda and I] paid rent we had about four dollars to our name. Before Amanda picked me up from work she went crazy at the grocery store and had to write a bad check to cover it. So - we'll be making a trip to the bank early tomorrow. Not that I mind; I can stuff myself silly with food now. I just realized how boring this all is. Has my life become this uneventful? Never mind, don't answer that.  I've been surfing the internet for the past ten minutes and of course stumbled across something very, very upsetting. Apparently the Bushies knew in Jan. about the G.I.'s forcing prisoners to suck dick at gunpoint, and like everything else; they sat on it until it fell into the hands of '60 minutes'. I'm speechless. We are all screwed. There can't be a country left in this world that doesn't hate us for being the... well... here; Mark Maynard put it best:    "We're shortsighted, arrogant assholes and we're going to pay a price for it".    I need to make sure I'm registered to vote in time... because this is getting  so  fucked. I apologize for the language, but Bush just seems to keep topping himself. At first when I heard about the prison abuse [which is a pretty nice way of putting things], I thought, "wow... I actually feel bad for Bush having to deal with this on account of a handfull of dumbasses in uniform". But knowing now that Bush knew five months ago... Unbelievable.

       three whole days  It must seem like we are trying to bore our readers, but I can promise you; we've just been very unintentionally lazy. We spent today [actually, yesterday] filming in Santa Monica & Venice and we have lots of new video to show you... but I am afraid I am too tired and my contacts are way too dried out to spend the time to post them now. It's on my list of things to do when I wake up. Till then.  Actually: I'll leave you with this one clip thats already been exported. This is a shot from the top of a chain of rocks that stand probably ten or more feet above water level. Now, keep in mind; the rocks you can see at the bottom of the screen are very large rocks, easily as wide as I am tall. The waves [of course] hadn't been anywhere near this size until I crawled up there with my camera to film the ocean. So needless to say -  urlLink I almost lost my camera here ... very, very stupid of me. I would have had to hurt myself. But luckily I turned my back to it, braced for impact and shoved the camera under my shirt just at the last second as the waves cleared the ten foot tall rocks I stood on and hit me head to toe.   ...Just my luck. More to come tomorrow.

       it's about damn time  Last night around two in the morning I wrapped up editing on Bye Bye Birdie [three months later], that was without a doubt the slowest and most drawn out project I've ever worked on. Of course moving didn't help; that postponed everything for at least a month; then there was the excitement of being here; that distracted me for at least another month and I got far, but not as far as I should have gotten.  Anyways; it's done - my computer is chugging away at exporting the clips for DVD [which will probably take 30'some hours], and now I get to work on more important things:   co-op films / synergy / writing / filming / re-designing caliblog.com / and so on...   Due to it's lack of traffic, I am going to mention our "cali: forum", it's a fairly new addition to the site and much better way to communicate / comment. Now our readers have two options: if they just want to "comment", as in leave a short thought that really doesn't desire any response; then they should still use the comment(s) link. But, if your are leaving a question, or would like a response to your post; then you should   urlLink use our forum &nbsp; ; the forum allows us here at caliblog to leave answers or comments of our own in a conversation styled manner.  Okay, now if you'll excuse me I think I am going to go to the beach before work and that only leaves me with six hours to enjoy the sun. I don't think anyone mentioned the last time we [Chuck, Amanda, Michelle and myself] went to the beach in Santa Monica; I jumped in the ocean... twice... and it was still very, very cold. But it was during the 101 plus heat wave we had recently, so it was shocking, yet refreshing somehow at the same time... but mostly shocking. I need to move to the beach, the valley can often be a slow-roasting oven with the mountains surrounding us on all sides and blocking the ocean breeze [the best part about CA]; now I'm just rambling. To the beach! Adios.

       pasadena  I hate to say this, because I love Ann Arbor; I have so many fond memories of those streets I could go on for days, but pasadena [at least at first glance] may very well pass-up Ann Arbor in the coolness factor. It's sad but true. Last night Amanda and I, taking the advise of Chuck and Michelle, went to see " urlLink Touching the Void " at the Academy 6 [in pasadena of course]. The theater reminded me so much of the State in A2 [Ann Arbor]; the old style structure of the building; the indie flix; the old red run down seats [although this theatre's were still much, much better than the States],  I have to say I'm spoiled now having gone to the AMC in the mall, the arm rest can be pushed down to make one big couch. But okay; moving on to the rest of pasadena: it's a strange combination of New York and A2, in the sense that it's as busy as New York [at least on a friday night] and lacks the up-scale yuppies A2 unfortunately has an over abundance of, but the business there is very reminiscent of home, and not to mention; they have an apple store; that alone is reason to love it.     Above [random picture]: here's a pic of Amanda cooking in the kitchen. Pay no attention to the giant build up of cups on the counter... we'll get to those soon enough.       Above [another random picture]: Yes this is just a pic of our closet, and yes it's sideways, but I like it, its one of those little details that no one ever pays attention to. Someday I'll look back at this picture and remember clothes I'll no longer have, or how I stole those black milk crates from the Toys 'r' us parking lot.   I would like to write more; but I seriously need to go to Kinko's like two days ago; so I better wrap this up soon. I started this entry before I went to work at two but I lost track of time and had to run out the door. I was planning on riding my bike to work, but I had to borrow Chuck's car [my battery died on me], Ikea has a program where if you ride bike/ walk / carpool/ or take the metro to work you get paid for it, sure it's only about a dollar a trip but hey, I should be doing it anyways, I've always wanted to be in the good habit of biking to and from work [I guess more imporatnly I need to get in the good habit of remembering to keep an eye on the clock].

       lemme axe you somethin'  We have some computers at work that the customers can use. They put a credit card in a little slot and whirr away. Today a woman [mid-50's] told me her computer at home died and she needed help with ours. I'm pessimistic when people ask for computer help, because it usually means they want us to do the work  for  them. Sure as the pope is catholic, she didn't even know where to type in a web address. I wondered if her "computer at home" was a big paperweight with a plant on top.   They try so hard to get us to come out from the counter. If you tell them what to do [and I mean describe in perfect detail] they ask if you can "show them". Once again, show me = do it. It can be frustrating when you've got work to do, and annoying when you don't.  The customers at a copy shop are less patient than customers anywhere else [Please, tell me if I'm wrong]. Everyone there has a deadline they have to meet, and waiting in a line for longer than 30 seconds is digging into it. I've never seen so many lines of impatient people.   Additionally, they expect results to be immediate. I've taken orders from several people who say "Don't worry, I'll wait." and become enraged when they find out we have other orders to take care of before theirs. A few hours is always too long. They have a plane to catch or a meeting to get ready for. You'll hear every variation in just a few weeks.   Everyone  is on a deadline,  everyone  will get fired if they don't get this project in on time,  everyone  is working for an asshole director that told him to do it in a couple hours, and  everyone's  children will starve if you can't get them 10,000 copies in an hour. You're not working for them, you're working with them, and the team captain ain't happy.  In reality, all these people have had days to get it finished and they've seen too many movies like Jerry Maguire where someone storms into a copy shop at 3am and gets a flashy portfolio done in fifteen minutes. [I can't stand that scene, by the way. That job would take hours.] Sadly, Hollywood, which has given us so much, teaches us all these terrible lies.  After a while, you become immune to the insults, threats, and bribes. They try very hard to make you feel like it's all your fault, and the weak ones will quit. Those who don't threaten will bribe. They offer to slip you a bill or ask what your manager's favorite bottle of wine is. I'm not exagerrating.  Thankfully, I'm thick skinned. I get more pleasure out of acting stupid and snickering inside my head while they act like I'm incompetent and ask to speak to my manager. They always tell them the same thing I did. Like parents with the "unified front" technique.  It's not always like this. Sometimes people genuinely just need help, and it feels good to do it. Most of the time, getting it by 6am works out fine. They drop by in the morning, all smiles, to pick up the project that they thought was in the toilet. When I can tell it's one of them, I always work hard to make it look great.  I'm not jaded. It's just more fun to write about the jerks.

      What  am  I supposed to do with my life?  If I get a house and a job that pays more than $8.50 an hour, will I finally be a responsible adult? Will kids make me feel like I served a purpose? Won't I just be dumping the same unanswerable question on them. What are  you  going to do? "Work and have some kids, I suppose."  It's as though life were a stack of bills, and everyone is supposed to find a unique way to spend their money. Well, there are only so many stores.   Somewhere between 20 and 35, fear grips half the men and women in this world. "I need money to retire on. I can't work when I'm 60." - "I've got to have kids. Otherwise, what was I here for?"  I ask myself that question every single day. What  am  I here for? There are billions of people on the globe. We've all been here the preverbial blink of an eye, as far as the universe is concerned - isn't my existence a bit extraneous?   Freud was right. Life is about sex. If it weren't, most of you probably wouldn't be here. There'd be a couple million people around, not 7 billion. 7 Billion says, "We like sex. Let's go have some more." We're manufacturers - and business is good.  A few people get to have fun every day, but most of us just spend our lives making sure that 2% is comfortable.   How many people don't kill themselves because everyone else made them feel guilty about actually going through with it?  So how do you win?  "Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life." Right?  Well, you'd have to stop caring about money and posessions. [Done. I stopped caring years ago.] We can take control of everything. I just have to figure out how to convince everyone else to stop caring.   Good luck.   In the meantime, I'm going to see the entire world. I want to travel. If I was born trapped on this planet, I'm going to every corner of the cage.   Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.  What if never working a day in my life is doing what I love?

      1)  The team saw  Spider-Man 2  this morning.  Great movie.  Four thumbs up.  They set up a lot for the future, and there are some things that you don't even see.  "What could they be, Billy?"  Hmmm...  2)  Have you guys heard of this 'C2' by Coca-Cola.  I'm sure you have.  It's all over the freakin' place.  We all tried it (It's not good).  But Chuck and I tried 'Pepsi Edge', the Pepsi version of the same thing.  We both concur:  I would definitely drink this, as would Chuck.  Go on...try it.  3)  One final note.  I just wanted to share my favorite quote of the day:  "You can't get off, if you never get on."  -think about it...

         My step-sister, Amber, just sent an email to say she'll be coming for a visit in late July. I wrote in an earlier post about her getting accepted to the Cali intisute of the arts; she'll be starting there in the fall and is coming for a long weekend for some type of presentation. When she's finnished with that, on Sunday night, she'll be coming here to stay for 2 days.   I've been thinking a lot about all of the things I want to do while she's here. I don't know if she's ever been to L.A., but if not, I'd like to show her downtown Hollywood and take a hike around Mahulland. I want to go to the beach, soak up some sun, and watch the surfers. I want to have lunch and go clothes shopping in Santa Monica. I want to get drunk, sit out on the balcony and stay up all night gossipping about everything (the way only girls do).    Needless to say I'm very excited. Amber is one year younger than me and a lot of fun. She's an aspiring actress, filled with energy. The night before my Dad married her Mom, she and I spent some time in the sauna, hung out in the kitchen eating a bag of marshmellows, and stayed up most of the night talking with my sister, Emily, about sex. It was a fantastic way to bond. I can't wait until she moves here and I have a perminant girlfriend to spend time with.      This photo was taken that night... almost 8 years ago. Wow! I can't believe it's been that long. Yes, I know, we look a little scary.

      My brother is back from Kenya. He made it safe. He was there for two and half weeks, and I'm sure he has a handful of amazing stories to share -- he left a  urlLink post  in our forum hoping to get some questions about his visit there. Here's his post:    I thought it would be fun to start a forum about kenya.. any one interested about kenya or just my experience in general can leave questions and i will attempt to answer [them] the best i can.. remember i was only there for 2 and a half weeks so i didnt see it all but i saw enough.. dont be afraid to ask about anything.. and i do mean anything...   I'm going to try and get some pictures out of him, but in the meantime; ask away [ you can click on the "post" link above, or click "forum" at the foot of each post ].

      About a year ago, I used to have a brand new Geo Metro that my dad bought me in high school. The gas mileage on this thing was awesome. I got maybe 50 miles to the gallon on the highway. Moving to California and paying $2.50 a gallon can make you pine for a tiny little car.  I was driving along one day, minding my own business, when a little old lady pulled out in front of me at an intersection in front of a hospital. I swerved to the left, but she tried to speed up and I hit her head-on going about 45mph.   When I hit her, the airbags exploded and burned my t-shirt, and the seatbelt left a mark across my chest. I have an old injury to my left knee, which also got banged up pretty good. I was doing ok though, considering.   The adrenaline kicked in pretty fast, and I got out of the car without any trouble. I ran over to the lady's car to make sure everyone was ok, because I could hear her screaming "Oh my God" over and over again.  As I got up to her car [I think I opened the door for her], I realized that she had a clean break of the bone in her forearm. She was holding it just above her elbow and it looked like she had another joint. Her forearm and hand were just hanging off the middle of her arm, completely limp. It was snapped in two, and she wouldn't stop screaming.     I went back to my car and picked up my cell phone off the ground to call 911. I told them I was about 2 seconds from the hospital. They took about 5 minutes to get there, so I sat on the grass in front of my car on a small hill. All of a sudden I felt really winded, and I realized that I'd hurt my knee pretty bad. I could feel it swelling up inside my jeans. Then I felt sore over my whole body.  A guy came up and asked me if I knew where I was going. I was so out of it that it seemed really odd. I thought he was asking the question in the philisophical sense. I wondered "Where  am  I going?". Of course, he was just trying to see if I was coherent by asking me a simple question. When I realized it, I said I was fine and to check out the lady in the car.     They pumped me up with vicodin and put a brace on my leg and right hand. It felt like I had fractured a bone in my hand, but it healed itself - I guess. I'd say I came out of it ok, considering how well the old lady had fared.  The worst part was the money. Not two hours before the accident, I'd spent $200 on my car to fix the muffler. The ambulance ride that lasted thirty seconds cost me $500. I still owe them $150 that my insurance didn't cover.     Other Interesting Facts: 1. My bike was stolen a week later. 2. I was on my way to a bible study. 3. I put on my seatbelt a block before I hit her. 4. It was the last time I saw my ex-girlfriend. (She drove past the accident and didn't see me.)

      Well it's been awhile since I've posted anything non-political so let me ease into this post with a quote from Reagan Jr.   “I think it was a relief for Americans to look at pictures of something besides men on leashes. If you are going to call yourself a Christian -- and I don't -- then you have to ask yourself a fundamental question, and that is: Whom would Jesus torture? Whom would Jesus drag around on a dog's leash? How can Christians tolerate it? It is unconscionable. It has put our young men and women who are over there, fighting a war that they  urlLink should not have been asked to fight  -- it has put them in greater danger.”   Sorry Mark, I stole that one from you. But it's such good stuff I couldn't fight the temptation [ note: the link added within the quote is semi-random. Reagan Jr. made no mention of it -- I just thought it was nice place to sneak it in... ].  Moving on: Here's some random video clips from the other day when Amanda called in sick to work, we spent the afternoon sitting on some rocks overlooking the ocean. The same rocks we discovered while filming the "project: pedal" footage. First off; we spotted a group of dolphin's swimming about fifty feet out,  urlLink but I couldn't get a damn shot of them ; they kept coming up and going under for a minute only pop up somewhere completeldifferentnt. Slippery bastards.  Second up; here's a clip of Amanda on the rocks.  urlLink She's so cute .  And, it's getting late, so the last fews things I wanted to write about are going to be in list form:  Third clip: don't worry... the camera was in a  urlLink water tight case .  Today at work I saw  urlLink Jeremy Davies , he was sporting a full beard [I'm guessing for his recent roll as Charles Manson]. I was going to say "you kicked ass in  urlLink CQ ..." or something along those lines. But a lady from our lighting department beat me to it. That bitch [ just kidding -- she's actually very nice ].   ps. This was found in the apartment today, and I thought it was so funny I had to post it for the world to see.      Enjoy.

      Funny thing happened before the movie last night; they were running paid advertisements and trivia while people were being seated and an "eco- something " from Coke Cola came up reading: "If you end your shower a minute earlier than usual, you'll save over 115 gallons of water a month".  Which I thought was humorous considering that each six pack of Coke requires 88 gallons to make. So in theory if you drank one less can of Coke a day, at the end of the month you'd have saved over 440 gallons.

      I just wanted to take a minute and say Chuck, Mike and I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  today and I haven't been this inspired since I Mike and I went to the  urlLink We The Planet  seminar at Eastern Michigan University, last fall.   It was great! Please go see this movie.  urlLink GET OUT AND VOTE ! We need to turn this country around and repair some of the damage that has been done.  Thank you. And good-night.

      Chuck and I went to see  The Terminal  today, which was a great movie, and we saw a trailer for  Anchorman .  More than 50% of the trailer clips were not even in the version of the film that we saw, and they were funny.  It made me wish I could have seen the clips in context.    I mentioned that we watched  The Joe Schmo Show  on DVD, yesterday.  I had picked it up at Ameoba, after the movie.  It said on the cover, "uncensored", but as we watched the episodes, it was censored like crazy!  I felt SO deceived.  So if you were going to buy it, which it IS an addicting show, just buyer beware.  I still enjoyed just fine, but it's the principle of the whole thing.  ...O.K., that's all.

      I can honestly say that today (Wednesday) was best day I have had in a long time.  I really, truly enjoyed myself for the first time since I've been out in California.  And it went a little something...like this:  Chuck and I both stayed up until late into daybreak before sleeping for about two hours (Chuck had to work and I was at home working on some things).  I woke up around 10:30a.m. and then proceeded to wake up 'Sleeping Beauty', so that we could start our day.  We got ready and headed out the door by a little after 11:00.  Chuck and I had gotten invitations to go catch a private screening of " urlLink  Anchorman:  The Legend of Ron Burgundy  " (coming to theaters July 9th) at the Arclight Cinemas in downtown Hollywood at 1:00p.m.  We felt really bad, because Mike and The Girl had the morning off, but it was a VERY small audience and we could only get an invitation for two.  They still don't know, yet, and we'd appreciate it if nobody mentioned it to them, so "Shhhhhh!"  The theater, itself, was really nice (it's the same theater that I had ran into Thomas Jane and Rebecca Romijn at for  The Punisher  premiere).  It was a lot more decorated than your normal theater, including actual CGI mattes and preliminary drawings for  Shrek 2  framed on the walls (I'm guessing that it premiered there, as well). Before we had made it to our seats they offered us free popcorn and sodas, which was pretty generous, I thought.  Inside the cinema, we had great seats, right where we would have wanted to be.  It was a really small crowd of people.  Before the movie started, a P.R. guy for Dreamworks came out and gave a quick rundown of the campaign they have set up for the next few weeks before the movie opens.  Apparently, they're going to have 'Channel 4' vans going around town spreading the news (as it were) and giving away T-shirts, frisbees, and condoms that say "Stay Classy!", Ferrell's catch-phrase in the movie.  Chuck and I both want to get our hands on some of that booty.  After he had finished, he introduced one of the writers of the film to say a few words and answer any questions people might have. Finally...the movie!  I can't say too much about the movie, because of the disclosure rules for early screenings, but it was just so funny.  I would actually go see this movie a few more times.  I just thought it was THAT good.  I'll put up a review tomorrow, though.  I'm too tired tonight.    Following the movie, we headed over to the most spectacular Music/DVD store.  If you want it, you could probably find it there, including an extensive collection of classic LP's and freakin' LaserDiscs...LaserDiscs!!!  I picked up a few things in there (though I could have spent $1,000 and still not been done).  We grabbed something to eat after that and then went home and watched some of the  Joe Schmo Show  on DVD. It was a really good day.    Oh, I almost forgot.  The writer...the one that had come out and talked to us...  Yeah, he was really funny.  Of course, he should have been.  It was Will Ferrell.  Will 'freakin' Ferrell!!!  He was standing not more than 15 ft. in front of us talking to us about the movie, telling jokes, and basically just being Will Ferrell -warning us of a salmonella outbreak in the popcorn and telling us that they've opted not to validate parking, exactly what you'd expect from him.  He even was willing to take questions and converse a little with the audience.  How cool is that?!  How cool is he?!  I could go on for quite a while, I'm still so excited.  I was still smiling for hours afterwards.  I had literally forgotten how it feels to be as happy as I was today.  It's like a drug now.  I need to feel that level of happiness more.  And the cost of this fabulous day?  $2.50, between the two of us.  I would have happily paid $50 for the same experience.  I just wanted to share my day with you.  It was good and I was happy...

      Since we were all talking about  the Simpsons  today, I found an interesting article in Yahoo news. It seems that  the Simpsons  are securing the Archbishop of Canterbury to be in a  urlLink future episode . The Archbishop is apparently a big fan of the show, which he praised for it's "humour and humility." When it rains, it pours. For more information on my favorite show, visit  urlLink snpp.com .  We have a late submission for the photo contest, which I wanted to have up before I go to work. It's from Kerrie in Michigan, representing for all us former residents. Apparently she has a 102 degree fever and had to take the picture with no set-up, sans make-up. So let's all hear it for Kerrie! She's cute as a button.        Just as I posted this, Christine sent me an entry. Apparently, we're huge in Japan. Of course, we'd be huge comparatively, if we went there.       If you could go back in time and change one event in your life, why is that a stupid question?  Sleep tight, everyone. Only in dreams can we make no mistakes.

      Well, everyone, we've had a lot of fun with the photo contest. We made fun of Mike, slacked off in school, ruined a shirt, flushed a sign, developed a twin, and saw some boobs. Well, I saw them anyway. Sure some people didn't participate, but I don't hold it against them. Let's face it - the prize wasn't  that  great. Cash next time?  So today is the last chance. If you really meant to do it and just never got around to it, today is the day. I'll be closing the contest around midnight, maybe a little bit after. By the time I get home from work, I expect to know who I'll be congratulating as our first contest winner. I'll have it posted before I pass out on the couch.   So send something in. You can fire it to filmforthought@hotmail.com. Remember, we're going for a big finish here. Here's a submission I got the other day that concerns me a little. I don't know who the person is, but I know who sent it.     Just a side note here - I have to resize all these down to website size, so sending me a picture at 900 dpi doesn't really help me out a bunch. It just crashes my e-mail. I mean resolution is important, but let's not go crazy.  That said, everyone enjoy your day. I'm going to sleep now.

      Here's a photo from Kenya of my brother, Nick. The Church group that he went with has a  urlLink web site  with a handful of photos up. Looking at this makes me miss him so badly, I wish I could be there too.      I tried signing the guest-book but it wasn't working. So Nick, if you're out there reading -- I love you.   ps. Chuck is watching the Simpson's DVD he bought, and speaking the lines before they say them. Very strange.

         Tzaddi sent me this the other day. The first one says Chuck stinks. I never seem to get one submission without a second though.  Here's one from an 'anonymous' entrant:     Just to clarify - stroke of midnight on Monday night is it for submissions to  urlLink the contest  (ok, I won't kill you if it's 1am) but I am posting the winner before noon on Tuesday. Just in time for the Wednesday hits spike. We get the most readers in the middle of the week. I guess everyone is so bored at work, it's all they have to do.  It's kinda funny that we have this group of ten or twelve people that submit comments and pictures. We have a thousand people a day reading the site and only ten people ever speak up. So here's to the loud-mouths, making us look popular. May you never be silenced. (You know who you are.)  I had an awful day at work. The kind when you want to drive a car through plate glass, or maybe a fist - but I don't really feel like writing about it. Let's just say people are jerks. Most people. You guys are ok I guess.  This guy is ok too. Go here.  urlLink Drew Olbrich .

      Well I have the next two days off. Which means: it's time to get some work done.   First things first. I need to go pick up a copy of " urlLink On Tiptoe: Gentle Steps to Freedom ", an Oscar nominated documentary I've mentioned earlier on the blog, I also mentioned several attempts at finding a copy to watch before meeting with Eric Simonson, the director. But I didn't realize it hadn't been released yet. Here's an excerpt of a review from imdb:   "This short film packs more emotion into 45+ minutes than most films pack into 145. The cinematography, editing, and audio of this film is as good as it gets. You'll immediately become a fan of Joseph Shabalala..."  Anyways, the director himself lent a personal copy for me to go over before I sit down with him and pick his brain for an hour. On one hand; I don't know what to say. On the other; I have too many questions for him. I am currently busy sifting through them and separating the " I need to ask someone for help on this " ones, from the " that's something you just have to learn as you go " topics. But I am very excited to see his film, and to get an opportunity to talk with him.   It's 3:19 in the morning right now, and I don't like anything I've written above, so I'm going to stop here because I'm obviously too tired and foggy-eyed to go on. You know that feeling when your on the verge of falling asleep while in mid-sentence? Yeah, I'm guessing the second my head hits the pillow I'm going to be out cold. "Goodnight cruel world".

      This is actually a response to a comment from my "...Underdogs..." post, but I ran out of room in the comment box, so please forgive me.  I wouldn't usually bother with a response to someone who's, obviously, just talking to talk, but he said something that I really didn't like and it wasn't about the Pistons.  Aside from the idiotic wisecrack about Detroit burning down the city, considering it's L.A. who's popular for it's outbreaks and riots, not Detroit (not to mention it's not like they're not used to titles from the Red Wings), what kind of 'tail between the legs' person comes online and insults other people without even having the balls to leave his own e-mail address?  ...and just for the record, I happen to be a Laker fan all the way back to "Showtime".  I was thrilled that they got their rings a few years back, they earned them, but my boys will always be the Pistons.  Everyone, feel free to skip this post.  It will just take a second.  **********************************************************   One year wonder?  They've been one of the last few teams in the playoffs for the last three years.  Every year they've gone up another notch.  They didn't just come out of nowhere.  Their defense is raved about throughout the league.  And it wasn't like they knocked the kings from their throne.  The Lakers are nobody special this year.  They're not even the returning champions or anything.  In fact, what were they last year?  5th in the West?  What was Detroit?  Oh, yeah, that's right...number 1 in the East. (One year wonder...)  -Hell, the Lakers didn't even finish in the top three this year, because they weren't a strong enough team to earn it.  Their regular season record was 56-26, the Piston's was 54-28.  Last time I checked, two games is not a dominating margin (Or course, it's more games than the Lakers could pull off in the Finals).    To add insult to injury, the Pistons won their playoff games straight out, while the Lakers had AT LEAST two games this year where they were screaming, "Please go in!!!", at last second shots, because, minus some dumb luck, they were as good as beaten.  Yeah, that sounds like an unstoppable force to me.  You really should think about what you're saying before you open your mouth and put your foot in it.  There was ONE team to beat in the Finals this year, and it wasn't the one voted most popular, but it was, apparently, the one most likely to succeed.    On a final note, how stupid do you sound telling someone THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW that they don't know anything about basketball?  Tina happens to be one of the most intelligent people I've ever know in my life.  If I was as big a blow-hard as you seem to be, I wouldn't put my E-mail address in the comment box, either...Jackass...

      I have two more pictures for the contest. James sent me a new one, and Carinne sent me one. I'm going to post both of them, but I should be stricter on Carinne for not following the rules. I think if we all ask her nicely, maybe she'll send us a goofy pic of herself, sitting in a miniature chair or something like that. Maybe she just doesn't want her picture all over the web, like the attention whores in this apartment. (Mostly me.)    Ironic that James will ruin a t-shirt to win a t-shirt. Good thing I wasn't giving away a car.      Carinne's entry, while cool, seems to lack the all-too-important element of a real person. She told me she was in the left hand corner, but I'm not so sure. She did take the time to do something, so I guess that makes her better than the rest of you. Don't be lazy like me. Enter the contest. Win a t-shirt. Get a free link to your blog. Piss off Dave. Does anyone really want an aussie to win?  I thought maybe you guys just need an example. I've already seen a couple people flex their Photoshop muscle, so I thought I'd show you what I can do with a digital camera and about 10 minutes. This is, what I feel, the ideal submission contains.    If only I had a clone. We could both work two days a week. I don't know why I have those sour expressions on my face.   Hopefully, Stacey and Kerrie will send in pics to top this thing off. Then we can all get on with our lives. Maybe Tzaddi too, if I give  urlLink earth 2 Tzaddi  some nice big props. She seemed a little shaken by not being included, but she's a funny girl, so go check her out.  I leave you for the night, because I don't have anything else to talk about. I'm going to sit on the couch, drink a box of wine, and watch a few episodes of the greatest TV show ever conceived and painstakingly illustrated overseas... the Simpsons.

      Everyone can rest easy again, the movies are back on the server. So go crazy.   I spent half the day looking over my shoulder alone in the apartment [or so I hoped]. After I got out of the shower I walked in the bedroom to find a hand-written note laying on the bed reading: "I'm watching you". Since I had been home alone for the past two hours, I was 40% concerned I was being stalked and 60% hopeful it was Chuck and Billy playing a prank on me. But unfortunately, after a long six  hours of paranoia, Chuck and Billy admitted to the note, no exciting stalker stories to speak of here.  I spent the other half bored out of mind. I wrote some. Taught myself Flash MX; made a stupid 'test' web site. Fell asleep in the shower. Did the dishes. Blah blah blah. Read alot of current news, most of which was spoon-fed crap [the usual].  Speaking of which, it put a smile on my face to read that Tex is  urlLink hanging onto the last thread  of his pre-war accountability. What a slow and beautiful downward spiral. Also, here's something I found interesting / terrifying:   It's not a political judgment that said, `Let's see if we can cook the books.' We can't get away with that now. Nobody was out to cook the books.   That was Powell making a statement about a terrorist report released last year, that was now found to be  urlLink dead-wrong . Surprise, surprise. But does anyone else find the quote: " We can't get away with that now ", disturbing? Because if I said that, or anyone else for that matter, I would imagine, it would strongly imply that in the past I could " get away with that "; but not anymore. Did he just admit to " cooking the books " in the past. It  would  be consistent with their record of things "said", and things "found to be true". Ugh... but I can feel myself starting to rant, so I'm going to call it a night before I get too carried away.

      Well, I'd post another picture of a caliblog fan, but I don't really have one. With the exception of James (Who should really know better than to try and pass off an old pic for a new one. I know she looked nice, but lets not lose focus here, James.) I'm sure he'll probably send us an  updated  pic sometime in the future. As for the rest of you, it's a weekend left. Remember, Dave thinks you're all losers.  I'm still working on our website problem. Putting the movies on a different server isn't really going to help. We're still burning 1.5GB a day on just the visitors, sans movies. This is getting complicated, but I promise you I am trying to figure it out. I'm on turbo-lazy speed.  Since we started the blog, people have been linking to us and showing their support. If it weren't for my deeply rooted fear of clutter, we'd put links to all these people on the left bar. Because I am a neat freak, and six is almost more I can handle, here are a few links to people that seem to have one eye on us. Go check them out, because they're all really cool.   urlLink The Bean Blog  From the one and only, Oz.  urlLink Gutter Slut Anonymous  Stacey rocks.  And  she's from Canada.  urlLink American Blogger  The man himself, James Shirley.  urlLink My Big Fat Fishbowl  She's going to be famous soon.  urlLink Little Sea Nymph  Nerina's  new  blog, with an  old  pen camera.  urlLink live with kinky carinne  When the name  doesn't  say it all.  urlLink Reflections of a Whimsy Chick  A girl from Michigan.  urlLink The Earley Edition  Dave, Australia's own reporter. and my buddy,  urlLink Pete  Check out his pictures section.  The 4th season of the Simpsons was released Tuesday. I've been waiting on it for a while. I've only watched one episode ("Whacking Day"), so I've got 21 more to go. Good thing it's my day off. Didn't I just tell everyone I'd figure out the website problem?   I used to date a girl that loved the show as much as I did, but now I only have Billy to watch it with. Kinda sad. Michelle never liked it as much. She faked it - but that might not have been the only thing she was faking.

         I just wanted to let everyone know about a really interesting blog that I found from one of our faithful readers.  It's a newer site, but definitely one to watch.  Aside from the fact that I thought that this person was pretty funny (kind of cute, too) and the blog was an enjoyable read, she has been given the opportunity to be a contestant on a new 'reality' television show called  Casino Night .  That right there should be enough to draw some attention.  If I remember right, she is supposed to start her little journey of celebrity on Monday and already the drama has started.  "What's happened, Billy?  What-Oh-What has happened?!  What could possibly have gone wrong?  Did her long lost twin sister come out of the shadows to reveal a hideous secret?  Was SHE the one who pulled the trigger from the grassy knoll?  Does her loyalty lie with her friend or her boobies?"  There's only one way to find out (unless I mention it later).             Go to  urlLink My Big Fat Fishbowl  and show some support for a cool girl who just wants to play some cards...and be on T.V...and get a little more respect from a friend...and post a blog...and have a moment that I feel is more like an  It's a Wonderful Life  moment than a  Christmas Carol  moment, but whatever...  Go check out the site, I think it's the groundfloor of something really cool.  I'll be checking up on you to see if did, so...

        In case you were sleeping in a cave tonight and missed the news, the Detroit Pistons have done the unthinkable.  Tonight, they have done everything that they were told they couldn't do - by everyone with a voice in sports.  The HIGHLY unfavored Pistons have not only beaten, but devastated the all-star packed, bred for a championship Los Angeles Lakers...and it couldn't have been sweeter.  Putting aside a last second three-pointer from Bryant in game two to tie and eventually win, we're looking at a 4-game sweep...in the other direction.  You don't know how good it feels moving out here to L.A. and seeing my boys from back home take it all and do it at home.  It's just awesome!  Congratulations and props to the NBA World Champion Detroit Pistons.  I just wish I could get my Conference and Finals jerseys/t-shirts like everyone else in Michigan (that part kind of sucks).  I have to celebrate all alone.            On the good side, I have been inspired beyond all limitations to kick the @$$ of this town and succeed.  If my boys can come to L.A. and overcome insurmountable odds, then so can I.  This is my resounding slap in the face.  I'm going to do it no matter what.  Expect a lot more from me from this point on, because you're going to see it...

      My buddy Pete in Germany sent me a picture for the contest. He's obviously studying hard, but who could pay attention to teachers when they're speaking German all the time. That's right ladies, my friend is fluent in German [which means he's brilliant], but he's also taken. By a cute girl I might add.      Sorry to everyone who's mad cause the movies are still down. I thought it might help our bandwidth to move them to another site, but I don't think it's going to help as much as I wanted it to. If you absolutely have to have one to show to your mom, or a famous director, just fire me off an e-mail and I'll put it back up.   But until I find a website without a hidden cancellation fee or something like that, it might be another day. If anyone has any suggestions, we need some hosting with about 80GB of bandwidth that's moderately priced. This all comes out of our pockets, and I'm trying to avoid paying more than $30 a month.  Some kid took one of my pictures off the site and put it on his. Normally, I wouldn't care, especially since the image is James Kolchalka's artwork, but he wrote the  exact same thing  about it. I mean it was a quote. And he acted like this was his own personal thought about it.  I tried to leave a comment, but he wouldn't take it off. Since he didn't actually steal the picture (he just linked to it) I just gave a different picture the same name and put it on our server. Let's just say I hope the next time he loads his site that his mother isn't standing behind him.  Website warfare, baby - and I'm a 4 Star General.

        For those of you who don't know, the Detroit Pistons are one (home) game away from winning the NBA Finals.  If not for a last second 3-pointer in game 2 by Kobe Bryant, this was a 4 game sweep.  Yet for some reason the Pistons still fail to get any respect for what they've done.  I have to hear it everyday at work from these hardcore Laker fans that the Lakers are going to take the next three (of course the've said that for the last three games, so it's losing some of it's impact).  They say that any team in the East is just a playground team coming to play a real pro ball team in the West.  That there is no match-up.  They keep saying the Lakers are just trying to stretch it out (for Las Vegas' sake).  We have one more game in Detroit tomorrow night and hopefully they can celebrate at home with a victory.  Go Pistons, baby!!!

      So we got our first entry to the t-shirt contest just minutes ago. This one made me laugh out loud, so I had to post it as soon as possible. I just want Dave to know he has an early lead. I'm not sure if anyone will beat the amount of work that went into this one.   urlLink     Under the picture, it says "Earley Edition editor, Dave, points out the sky writing. "Mike really must suck," he said."  My favorite part is the actual story. It begins "A most unusual contest has begun, spanning this wide planet; to win a t-shirt denigrating the state of Michigan. In another, more innovative way to procrastinate, Caliblog team member Chuck has some up with a contest sure to win the hearts and minds of millions."  I'm glad someone knows what the contest is  really  about.  He continues, "One such inhabitant of the planet, Earley Edition Editor, Dave, has wasted some of his precious time in an attempt to win this prize."  I'd say it's a tough call, but as of today, Dave is the only entry. I've decided the contest will end on Monday, June 21st. So get your entries in soon. And for the love of God, don't send a file bigger than 1MB. Almost crashed my e-mail account.

      Mike woke me up this morning to ask if he could borrow my car. I can't remember exactly, but I'm pretty sure it was around 8:30. I had gone to sleep around 8, so I was more than a little irritated, but the alternative was driving him myself and picking him back up. No thanks. Now I'm car-less until about 6 tonight.  The overnight gig is really starting to hurt me. I've been able to manage sleeping longer than four hours in a row about 10 times since I moved here. I have to catch my nods in the morning, and then again right before work.   Could it be the heat? The merciless sun? I'm not sure about the specifics, but my days off I stay up all afternoon, just so I can plop my head on a pillow, just as the horizon is going black. I never realized how wonderful it is to sleep at night.  The reason I got especially irritated with Mike is that it's 9:30 and I'm wide awake. I couldn't have slept longer than an hour and I won't be able to pass out again until tonight.     Note how much higher June is (still only the 14th.) 181,000 hits strong.  Fortunately, due to some serious downloading that's been going on from the site, I've actually got some work to do this morning. I'm putting all the movies onto an external server so we'll be able to show you all the movies we want, all the time. It's just a matter of getting them all off one and onto the other.   I also got a book yesterday, thicker than the Bible, about Macromedia Flash. I'll learn this program if it's the last thing I do. I have a software snafu right now, but I'll figure it out. I can't open any of my tutorial files in the program. It stinks. It keep telling me "Unexpected file extension", if anybody out there knows what that means. Anyway. I just want to be able to design a cooler site for you guys.   My sincerest apologies if a download doesn't work out today. I'll try to get the site up and running as soon as my sleep-deprived eyes and brain will allow. In the meantime, enjoy some hilarious pictures, which we often feature on the website as well.

      I've been dreaming about puppies; a whole littler of puppies. Curled into balls with their eyes still closed. So small they could fit into the palm of your hand. I think their mother died and I was trying to figure out how I would have to feed them with a bottle until they were big enough to find decent homes for. The first one I picked up I held onto and never put down the entire time I tried to get the rest into a box to keep them warm. He started to grow at an incredible rate and before I knew it he was as big as a human baby curled around my torso. He felt so good and close and connected to me.   I'm not sure what all of that means but for some reason I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. My dreams are often times very intense and incredibly detailed. I try to tell other people about them but they usually think I'm crazy and going on forever, and then soon stop paying attention to what I'm saying. It's true, Chuck was right...I do talk a lot. Most of the time once I've started I notice after a while that I'm the only one still paying attention to me.

      I have a nervous habit of writing on a piece of paper until it's completely filled and then throwing it away. Sometimes it's a note to myself, other times I just write random nonsense. Some people draw, I write. Even when I don't have anything to write. In college, I started doing it on index cards.     Untitled 1 (Index Card)  Black and blue pen, & red stamp ink on white notecard. Total Dimensions: 3" x 5"  Notes Collection    Untitled 2 (Index Card)    Untitled 3 (Index Card)    Untitled 4 (Index Card)    Untitled 5 (Index Card)    Untitled 6 (Index Card)    Untitled 7 (Index Card)    Untitled 8 (Index Card)

      I have an idea for a business. Here it is: I become an arms supplier, selling my supplies to foreign up & coming political leaders in bulk [ an un-bias political trend spotter if you will ],  making a nice profit for myself. Sounds okay so far, right? Well, here's where the money really starts rolling in.  I [anonymously] blow the whistle on the buyer. Calling attention to any would be "targets", creating mass paranoia. While I'm at it, I'll slip my business card to a handful of "big wigs", and maybe cut them a deal on weapons.  That's it. That's my idea. I'll just keep selling my "products" under the radar to a variety of outside influences, and in return, well, I'm sure you see the pattern. It's beauty is in it's simplicity. A twisted 'Spy vs. Spy', where I sell one the over-sized hammer, then the other a giant boxing glove, then a spring loaded car seat... each of course for a pretty penny.  I just hope nobody has  urlLink thought of this before .

      Mike and I have started running again to train for the bike trip. It's only been a week, so far, but it feels good and I hope I can stick with it. I mean, I know I have to if I want to do this bike trip…. And I do want to make this trip. Sometimes I think I might act like it's not a big deal to me…. But honestly, it is. I want it so bad.     Running sucks. It's one of the hardest things I've ever done. I'm not sure if it's the same for everyone else, but it's just one of those things for me. Mike and I are motivated in totally different ways so it makes training together difficult. Not to mention that he is an award winning cross-country runner. Anyway, he is motivated by people telling him he can't do something…. he likes to prove them wrong. I on the other hand need lots of encouragement. The way Mike gets on Chuck about writing and filming is the same way he gets on me about running. I hate it. Mike is a little more relaxed this time around and I'm a little more determined. We're taking things a bit slower and I think it's going to work out ok.

      I have to go to work in a half hour, so this has to be quick. Quick so I can lay down for a minute, that is. 30 minutes to be precise.  Billy and I went to see Van Helsing. Despite what the critics had to say, the special effects were better in the movie than the preview. The theatre had cheap tickets, but the film was out of focus for 15 minutes. I had to go get the manager twice before they finally fixed it.  I promise a better post tomorrow morning. I just wanted to remind everyone to send in their pictures for the t-shirt contest. I'm not keeping this shirt, so one of you had better take it. I've had tons of people ask about it though.  Pistons rock!

      God bless Wi/Fi. At this moment, I am slumped down in Billy's chair on the back balcony of our apartment, the night is a perfect cool and unusually quite [ I swear the second I typed that, I started to hear a helicopter coming from Burbank...anyways ]. This has to be the most comfortable post I've ever written.   Amanda and I finally splurged and bought a wireless router. And having said that, I would like to say: I hate windows. No matter what it is you're trying to install [hardware & software], it never works right off the bat, but what is most frustrating is that after an hour of trying the same three things over and over again, it just starts to work. With no obvious reason. It finally decides it's given you enough shit and does what it's suppose to do. Grr.   Well, even though we [Chuck, Amanda and myself] decided after looking over the footage filmed yesterday that we needed more [alot more] before we could make the trailer we wanted to make. I got bored this morning and spent four hours cutting it up anyways, just to see what I could make out of it. So, keep in mind this is an  urlLink unfinished version of a mock - teaser trailer  for a film we haven't even started to actually film. Be easy on us.   I want to thank everyone for their suggestions with different documentaries they've seen and enjoyed. Some I've seen, some I've only heard of. I'm going to add them to my netflix list and do some catching up when I get a chance. Speaking of which, I should get back to reading a book I bought today on documentary film-making, I'm mainly interested in the budget / funding aspect of the book.    side note: this is my 100th post. How exciting, I'm officially a dork.

      Nick, my brother, has left for Kenya. As I'm writing this now, he is half a world away. This could probably use some explaining: Three years ago, my brother built a school in Bolivia with a group of friends from a church he goes to. And this year, they are building a house for a church custodian [I think]. He'll be there just shy of a month. I have to admit, I am extremely jealous. It's strange but I miss him, yes, I realize I already live 2,500 miles away from Onsted. Maybe it's just that I don't know where he is, I mean I realize he is in Kenya... but thats about it. And Kenya is about twice the size of Michigan.      Above: Here's a pic of my bro playing guitar. Well, that much was probably obvious... but ladies, he is single.   Well, Chuck, Amanda and myself went out all day long filming footage for a mock-trailer for the bike documentary. It's not cut yet... actually, I am still busy importing it while I'm writing this. But I am thinking of selecting some key clips to post here as a sneak peak. But... it's gonna be at least an hour. Till then.  ps. It's been about an hour, so  urlLink here ya' go , it's all your getting for the moment. Enjoy.

      I think a lot about what might happen if this whole experiment goes end up. In the beginning, we were in pretty serious danger of tearing apart from the inside out. I've never wanted to go home as badly as my first month here. I was reminded of this, briefly, a few days ago when Mike got in my face about not writing with him.  I was sitting on the couch, reading a TV guide that had a  Simpsons  story on the cover. Maybe it was the fact that I was reading about television that got on his nerves. He made it a point to stand in front of me while saying he couldn't think of anything to write about. Then he asked me if I had any ideas.  Without looking up, I told him I couldn't think of anything and not to rush it. I think that's what pissed him off because he went on a rant about me never wanting to write. I've heard this rant before.   Truth be told, I haven't felt like writing in a long time. Our friendship, especially after we moved to California, has become more like a business partnership, and I'm the guy that never shows up to work. It was like moving here was signing a contract. We're all business from here out.  It was easy in High School. We were just goofing off when we made videos. I ponder often what we'd be doing right now if I'd never gotten him on the film kick in the first place.   Mike works like a freight train. He's always forcing himself. An effective method for him in the past. It got him to State finals in cross country, and rode him 2,500 miles on a bicycle across the United States.   It's the same method he's tried to force on me before. Three of us left, to ride from Michigan to California, and the second day I wanted to quit. As I sat on the side of the road, he stood next to me yelling about how I couldn't quit. How there were two walls, mental and physical and I was just hitting the first one.  I hated him. And I could tell he hated me for sitting there - doing nothing. If I'd been just another guy on a track team, he'd probably have written me off right then.   It's happened like that before. Back in high school even, we'd have these huge arguments about who was putting enough work into what. It was my fault most of the time. I have a tendency to be lazy.  I guess I'm one of those people that just takes it all. It was my suggestion to come to California and I seem to suffer for it every day.   I wish I had said more when he apologized. I just said "That's ok." Then I got on the computer to research the new trip, just to show him I was trying my best. I can't believe how submissive I was.   It wouldn't have mattered much anyway. Mike feels like I joke so much that it's impossible for us to have a serious conversation. Looking back on the five years we've been hanging out, I can only think of one.   We've had quite a few fights here, though I've never mentioned it. I remember another ending a little worse. I stormed out of the room and told Billy I just wanted "friends that don't expect anything from me." I cursed myself for ever stretching out my hand to touch something I apparently didn't have the desire to grab.  Billy said I've been introspective lately. One of the hardest things I've ever had to come to grips with is that I'm completely apathetic. I asked him if I was once, and he said not really. I think he was just being nice. Really, I'd prefer to do nothing at all.  I guess lately I've felt like a bit of a fraud. All these people keep telling me how great we are and how we're an inspiration to all the people out there going after their goals - and here I am, borderline all the time. Always ready to go back to my home, to my comfort zone where I can manage a soup store and live in obscurity, away from friends that expect more from me.  But a verse I've heard often from my father keeps coming back into my head...   "...to whom much is given, much shall be required." -Luke 12:48  ... and I can't help wondering if it's time to set the bar a little higher.

      Mike's been bothering me for a while to sell my zine on the website. I used to have a site called Send Tretter that sold stickers, but it never went anywhere. Is this something you guys would be interested in? For now, I've decided instead to give back to the community from which I've taken so much. To that end, I'm starting a contest.   THE CONTEST.    How to win -  The rules are simple. Take a picture of yourself, either alone or with other people, holding a sign that says something about Caliblog. You can say "Caliblog sucks.", "Mike sucks.", "I think Caliblog is Cali-cool." or even "Amanda, please dump Mike so we can go out sometime."   I don't care if you take it in front of your computer, next to the Washington Monument, or riding backwards on a horse [excluding those three ideas.] Just make sure it's memorable, because it  is  the competition.    The Prize! -  The prize will be a t-shirt. This t-shirt. I made it last night.     If you want, you can take a picture with it and we'll post it. There'll be a grand prize winner and a runner-up. Amanda gets to decide the runner-up and what prize they get. I'm all out of ideas. If everyone has fun, I'll make a different shirt and we'll do it again. I'm having fun already.   [E-mail submissions to filmforthought@hotmail.com. Put something like "photo contest" in the subject heading, ok - otherwise you'll get deleted.]

      Caliblog needs your help. Okay. Well, actually, rc.Pro [rolling chair productions:  Chuck and I's production group ] needs your help... I'm looking for documentaries with unusually excellent narrative. Tonight I'm going to call every video store in town until I find one with, " urlLink On Tiptoe: The Music of Ladysmith Black Mambazo ". It comes very highly recommended by some close friends of ours who know the guy who made the film [his first documentary, which was nominated for an Academy Award]. Apparently he has just finished cutting the first run of his latest documentary, and if all goes well, Chuck and I should have an opportunity to sit and pick his brain about narrative. Okay. I'm rambling. Back to the subject at hand:  Any of you readers out there who have seen or heard of a documentary that exceeded your expectations [preferably due to narrative]; please drop us a comment. Well, I would keep writing but at the moment Chuck and Billy are watching the big game and randomly shouting " hell yeah ", or " that was a f'ing foul "... you get the idea. It's distracting.  Actually before I go, I would like to posse another question; "why are so many of you out there shy"? We have been pulling in 1,300 new readers each day, and granted 40% of them leave within 20 seconds. But, that still leaves 520 people a day that visit between 30 seconds and an hour. Now, I'll be realistic, say on average, 8% of readers comment, that's still 40 people. We are getting about five comments on average per post. Those are sad numbers. I have to admit when we first found we had been noted on blogger; I was very anxious to hear all the different thoughts of people from every corner of the web. But it has only been a few days... perhaps I should be more patient.   At any rate, for those of you who have stayed longer than 20 seconds, thank you very much for reading. And for the few who have joined in on the conversation, we are always very excited to read what others have to say. Well, stay tuned.

      You ever feel like you're being watched?  We've noticed recently that someone from  urlLink Method Studios  has been checking out the website almost daily. From what I can tell, Method Studios is a collection of video artists based in Santa Monica. They've never signed the guest book or left a comment, so I'm going to try and start a dialouge.  It might just be that they like the site, but is it a coincidence that they do video work? Still looking for a PA job over here [hint - hint]. Either way, I can't help but be curious.  They have some pretty cool videos on the site. One in particular that I saw recently on TV with Billy. It's a new  urlLink Mountain Dew  commercial using the Spy v.s. Spy characters. They did it live-action, instead of animated.  Check out how many people worked on it [a 23-second spot!]. I wonder how much the costumes set them back.

      There's not enough time in the day... mostly thanks to work. I was looking forward to going to a book store in Studio City to look for some "how to" books on documentary script writing and budgeting. But, it's 10 'till 1 and I have to be at work at 2. All this makes me melancholy [for those of you who don't really know me... that was dry humor].   I was going to write something on the "sunnier" side. but I think I need to eat and hang out with Amanda before I leave. Sorry to be such a downer.  ps: everyone needs to  urlLink go see this film . The fact that Miramax Films [owned by Disney] funded it, saw it, and then refused to distribute it [due to Disney getting enormous tax breaks in Florida, which is governerned by Jeb], is suspicious enough to spark interest. Why else would they want it to just go away unless it packed a punch with some truth behind it?

      [ahem.] ...Is this thing on...? If I fuddle this for a moment or two, just remember that I love Amanda very much, and I could never really find the appropriate words. That said... here goes.  I met The Girl at Target, where Mike eventually started working and met her too. I didn't give her the nickname "the girl" until they started dating. Then I'd constantly ask "Where's the girl?" or "Why is the girl cooking for a piece of crap like you?". I thought it was cool that she had her own place a mile from ours. I still haven't dated a girl with her own house. I just wish they'd used it more when they wanted alone time.  It's hard for me to talk about Amanda without mentioning Mike. If you count up the names at the end, I'm sure I'll mention him as much as her, but I've always known them as a couple. I knew her briefly before they started dating, but only through work. We'd talk every once in a while, which is to say she'd talk and I'd listen.  Amanda talks a lot. She can spout a melee of dialogue that will bring you to your knees. We had a running joke at Target that whenever she walked into a room with someone else it was always her doing the talking. I must have seen her walk through the front door a few hundred times and it held up so well that it wasn't even a joke anymore. She puts the Micro-Machines guy to shame.  The guy she was with before Mike was basically his exact opposite. A 6'5" black guy, with former gang-affiliations that worked at Bally's Total Fitness. The two of them had been dating for six years I think, but they were pretty much on the rocks around the time Mike came into the picture. I sometimes forget how deeply Amanda was once rooted in african-american culture. It gave her perspective I think we could all use. She loves the person, regardless of race or creed.   A staunch Mike-supporter, Amanda defends him even when it's clear he's wrong. It gets on my nerves when I disagree with him and end up taking them both on, but you can't blame her for being loyal. She has her own opinions, and she's not afraid of speaking her mind... at great lengths. (Have I mentioned she talks a lot?)   Right around January of 2003 my priorities got a little awry and Mike and I stopped speaking to each other for about three months. I screwed up pretty bad. I moved out without saying anything, and the sad thing is that we never even had a fight. Just when I thought I had lost my friend forever, it was Amanda that brought us back together. I think she finally just yelled at him to call his friend. A few weeks later it was business as usual.    I used to love when she'd bring this giant beatbox to work and we'd unpack boxes while she blared Nappy Roots, rapping along the whole time. You wouldn't think it to look at her, but she knows more about rap than BET, and could still quote from every single John Mayer song. After hooking up with Mike, she adapted this sexy hippie, vegan girl thing that suits her pretty well. I've begged her to go dreadlocks. I think it'd be hot. (p.s. Even though she loves meat, she's a vegan on principle and rarely cheats. Though I've seen her gaze pretty longingly at Billy's smoked sausage. Nevermind...)  I love the way she'll always give me a hug when I'm feeling sad. She'll walk up and talk to me when I'm quiet and depressed and wrap her arms around my shoulders and tell me that she loves me. I always feel a little bit better, just knowing she really cares.   She calls Billy and Mike and I her "boys". She's very motherly to the three of us, which pays off big in the dirty dishes and clean living room departments. Guilt drives me to clean up every few weeks or so, but it's the girl that keeps us in order. She's also pretty forgiving of me sleeping on her couch for three months straight now.  While her choice of boyfriend can change her taste in music, manner of speech, or eating habits; the core of Amanda never changes. She is a beautiful, affectionate, and understanding young woman, and I can say  for certain  that my life would be very different right now if it weren't for her. I am forever indebted to her.  For those of you not named Amanda, who've never taken the time to look it up, it means "fit to be loved". If my blog had been four words long, I would have said that.     Pretty foxy too, eh?

      We've decided to try something new today.  As a reintroduction for new people who have joined our little site recently, each of us has decided to tell you a little bit about one member of Caliblog from our own perspective.  Obviously, per the title, I will be writing about Chuck.  If I had to describe Chuck in just one sentence I would say that he is exactly what Calvin would be if he had made it to his early twenties, both mentally and physically.  (I am, of course, referring to the character from Bill Watterson's strip Calvin & Hobbes)  But, obviously, this is not a one sentence post.   What can I say about Chuck that hasn't already been mentioned in Penthouse Forum?  I first met Chuck while working at Target, back in Ypsilanti, MI.  I was his boss.  After a few days of working together, he said that he would like to do what I do.  From there I took it upon myself to train him in every facet of my job.  Teaching him anything he would need to know to be a good supervisor, which he quickly lost interest in, but it did make him a pretty valuble asset to the team.  Along the way, we both realized we had similar taste in movies as well as a penchant for breaking out into song and dance spontaneously, especially to off-the-wall songs.  But it was our love for the movie  Moulin Rouge  that really tipped the scales.  Along with our other friend, Andrew, we would constantly do our own little renditions of the movie to pass the time at work.  We kind of became an inseperable little trio.  A lot of time has passed since then, some spots where we hardly talked for weeks on end, but here we are now, on the other side of the country together.  Man, that's hot!!!    From what I know of Chuck, he comes from a fairly normal family (mother, father, sister).  His father is old an fashioned type of man who subscribes to a strict moral structure and who believes in working hard and sacrificing for his family, for which Chuck holds him in very high esteem.  Though he does have a few frustrating quirks, overall Chuck's a pretty good guy.  Always inquisitive, he really likes to learn and experience new things.    For those of you who don't know, it was initially Chuck's little suggestion to throw caution to the wind and just move out to California.  As it came closer to fruition, he came down with a slight case of cold feet, but he knew this was something that we all had to do and it would be a lot easier if we did it together.  He did, however, stay an extra couple of weeks in Michigan, so that I wouldn't have to make the trip alone (What a guy!).  Adjusting to his new life hasn't come easy for him and he still struggles with certain aspects everyday, but that's more of the kind of thing that he can talk about, if he feels the need.  I would definitely say that Chuck is one of my closest friends.  Even if I had stayed in Michigan, that would still hold true.  I honestly don't think I would have made it here for this long or maybe even made the trip at all if not for Chuck standing by me.  Chuck's a good guy and a lot of fun to be around, usually.  We've been pretty stupid together at times.  For as crazy as Chuck can get (and he can...), generally, he's a very serious guy.  He's really at a point in his life where he's become deeply introspective.  Examining every aspect of his life and trying to figure exactly who is and what he wants.  If he had his choice, he would spend the next few years as a nomad, walking across the country and taking work as he needs it.  A very non-materialistic person, he discarded almost every possession that he owned before the trip, minus a few things that would fit in his very small car.  I have to admire him for that.  Actually, I could say that about making the trip, itself.  That was quite a bold move.  Now that he's out here, though, I think it's become a little less clear exactly what he wants out of this trip.  What else can I say about him?  He likes his women like he likes his coffee:  cold an bitter.  He loves  The Simpsons ,  Futurama ,  Family Guy , and the hardly heard of  Clone High .  He wears a nightgown to bed.  He loves strawberry ice cream, but only if it has real strawberries in it.  He wants to learn to play the guitar, which is hard since he gave his away to someone who could never afford to get one on their own.  He has an unhealthy obsession for Swiss Cake Rolls (seriously).  He thinks his ears are too big.  He's a huge fan of Val Kilmer.  He works at a copy place, but is hoping to get job as a P.A. out here.  If you want to know more about the wonder that is Chuck, stay tuned here or visit your local library...and now you know, and knowing is half the battle.  (O.K., he doesn't really wear a nightgown to bed.  He just wears it while he's relaxing around the apartment.)

      Knowing that an unusually large number of people are now viewing the blog, kinda' makes it somewhat difficult to write about 'nothing'.  I just caught myself sitting here searching the web for something interesting to mention... but realized that's not very original.  I suppose now is as good as a time as any to bring up our current project / "big decision". After a lot of discussing and debating and debating some more... Wait; this isn't where I should start this. Okay, from the top. If I had to guess how long it's been, I would say half a year ago Amanda suggested an idea for a documentary; a bike trip. And Chuck and I loved it. But it had worked it's way to the back-burner [probably due to it's many challenges]. And I know I've been mentioning co.op films lately but I think that I'm focusing too much on the short-term and not the long-term.   It was a hard decision to drop co.op films as my main focus, I hate [hate, hate, hate...] changing my focus when  my mind has been set. It feels too much like giving up, but really it's just being stubborn. So we've been doing everything we can the past few days to begin preparing, it's a little overwhelming.  I guess I should better explain the documentary: Right now, it's just Amanda and I riding bicycles from the Atlantic to the Pacific, zigzagging our way across the northern states. We will interview other riders we encounter [and possibly a few younger working people who would say they feel stuck in life]. The film will capture why someone would do something so dangerous and exhausting as well as what is gained. Well, as you can tell, we haven't written a professional sounding synopsis yet, but there's the gist of it. No ripping it off.  To give some visuals on what you might see in the documentary. Here are some random pictures from our last trip we took in '01.     Above: Judging from all the tall grass fields I would say this was taken in 'North Dakota'. It rained all day, and Tim got four flat tires. Here he is fixing his second, only an hour after his first.      Above: Here's the three of us [left to right: Chuck, Tim & Myself] outside of a mini-food mart somewhere in Illinois if I remember right.       Above: Here was the day we arrived in San Francisco (our goal), it was our 55th day. Yes, I'm as tired and dirty as I look in that picture.   I didn't do a very good job picking pictures to showcase, no mountains, no waterfalls. Just gas stations and grass fields. Oh well, maybe later. I need to get going now, it's my Mom's birthday today! Wish her a "happy b-day"!

      I was photocopying the usual amount of scripts last night when an older gentlemen I've worked with before came in. I showed him how to copy his own script a week previous, but he decided to drop it off anyway.   As soon as he got up to the counter, a guy recognized him. "Hey, I know this guy. You were in Kill Bill: Volume II, right?". "Yeah, thanks." came the response. "Quentin and I are working on a new one now."  I racked my brain, but I couldn't remember him. I found out later that he played the strip club owner, which is hilarious, because he's one of the nicest guys I've had in the store. For those of you who haven't seen it, he's a real prick in the movie, so he must be a decent actor.  On another topic, we've been stepped up to the prestigious Blog of Note list on Blogger's homepage. To tell you the truth, I'm honored. It's this kind of attention that's going to get me writing every single day again. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure about our server space. We're not hosted by blogger anymore, so I hope it holds out for a while. Go easy on the video downloads folks.   For those unaware, this blog is all about our attempt to make it in Hollywood. It's not a very original goal, but Shakespeare's written all the good stories anyway. And just a piece of advice. This all makes perfect sense if you start from  urlLink the beginning .

      Ronald Reagan, our 40th American President, died today from complications from pneumonia affecting his late stage of Alzheimer's disease.  Known for his 'Reaganomics' economy and bringing an end to the cold war with Russia, he was one of this centuries most endeared presidents.  He was 93.

          I spent my day working at an IKEA store in Carson today.  Trying to find different things from other stores to help improve our processes.  Blah, blah, blah, like you care about that.  Anyway, when I left work I stopped to get gas before jumping on the highway home.  While I was there I met a man who asked if he could wash my windows for change, 'Get 'em nice and clean'.  I was a little hesitant, but he continued to talk to me while I filled my tank.  Now, I used a card so that I could deny having the cash to give him (or whatever reason, him approaching me just made me more apt to pull it out instead of cash).  Before I was done filling up, though, I had a change of heart.  He had talked on long enough for me to stop seeing him as a phantom that would just go away when I left and became ever so slight of an acquaintance.  He seemed nice enough and in the mood to talk...Incessantly, so I decided I would buy him some dinner.  If he wanted money to eat, then I would just cut out the middle man.  A more pleasant man you could not want to meet.  His conversation skills we're a bit rough, speaking quite fast and not really looking for any responses.  I wasn't actually able to catch 100% of his speech.  One or two things slipped past me.  He was a pretty good guy, as far as I could tell.  His name was Clinton Parker and, from what he told me, up until a couple of years ago (when he turned 45) everything was pretty normal for him.  Not long after that, he began to develop intense epileptic seizures and it made it impossible to continue his life as he knew it and things began to spiral down.  I didn't asked any of the specifics (as I just let him talk) of his life following and leading up to this point, but it did make me wonder.  I also learned that the money he was asking for wasn't for food at all, but for the medication for his epilepsy.  He showed me his medicine with the prescription and a few other things from his pockets, including a card with his ID on it.  I'm not really sure what that was.  It may have been a medical card, since he was talking about his medicine as he showed it to me,  but he held it too close to my face to see.  It was small and gold, I know that with his name and birthdate.  He noticed my shirt said IKEA on it and asked if I worked there and if I liked it.  I told him yes and then he asked if I thought they would take a man with seizures if he applied.  I said that I didn't see why not.  He said he wanted to apply there as long as he could get a job where he didn't have to carry anything too heavy or drive anything, in case of a seizure.  I guess the medicine helps, but not completely.  I'm sure there's something there that he could do.  When we were done I said goodbye and gave him what little bit of money I did have in my pocket.  It didn't seem like it was going to waste.  He said, 'God bless you.  You a good person', and I smiled and told him to take care.  Then I headed home, but I couldn't stop thinking about him.         I want to know what his life was like before, when he was younger.  What did he want out of life?  What were his dreams then, and now, for that matter?  I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt for not being able to do more.  I've decided I want to go back there and talk to him some more, maybe even take the video camera.  I want to know all I can about his life to this point.  If he's as genuine as he seemed, I want to help him try to get a job and whatever else he needs, maybe a new outfit.  I may even try to raise some money for him, just for some basics.       I know, for the most part, that people make a decision to live their lives that way.  But what if once they have, they realize that they've made a wrong turn, but they can't see the opportunity to get it back to where they feel they should be.  Once someone has put him or herself in this life they seem to become almost a different breed of person in the community's eyes.  An un-erasable mistake that you try to ignore, like a smudge on a perfectly typed page.  I just want to know more.  Chuck and I had talked a couple of weeks ago about doing a documentary on street beggars.  Maybe this is a perfect place to start, if he's willing, that is.  O.K., I'll stop.  I know I'm just going on and on, but I was hoping writing about it would make the thought a little less prevalent in my mind.  Apparently, that wasn't the case.  But it is almost four in the morning and I have to work tomorrow, so I will stop...for now.  I'm not finished with you yet, though.  Until next time...WATCH THE DETROIT PISTONS, there will be a test following the video portion.

      I'm too tired or depressed or hungry... or what ever the hell I am right now to go into great detail on this, but Bush is  urlLink already quietly preparing for a draft  that would take effect as early as June 15th, 2005 [if of course, he is re-elected].  All I can say is that I'm nothing but anxious to fight for a cause that's proven to be so honest, noble, liberating and [especially] necessary. Ahh yes... I would say "sign me up", but they're taking care of that behind my back.  All I can think is; "why does Canada have to be so damn north... it's too cold all year round".

      I know everyone has been wondering what happened to me... I've been wondering the same. To be honest, I haven't been up to much lately except work. I just don't like to write when I have noting to write about. Yesterday was the first day I feel like I've done anything in a long time. Mike and I went to Santa Monica. We had lunch, shopped around and went to see the movie  urlLink 'Super-Size Me' . It was a nice day, the first day the two of us both had the day off in a long, long, time. On the way home we talked a lot about why we're here and what Mike wants to do as far as film goes. Mostly what direction he wants to start off in- which way he wants to go. Watching the movie was really inspiring, it showed us that you can make a good movie without really having a lot. We talked a lot about the Bike trip documentary we want to make. I think he's finally started to buckle down and get serious about it.  I think it was the first time I've been to the beach in weeks, and we didn't even actually go to the beach. But it was nice.  I was going to write more about Jill's house. I borrowed Chuck's digital camera to take a few pictures of the dog and the view and such, but the batteries died before I got the pictures onto  my computer.   I found out recently that my family doesn't even read this blog.... I suppose that's kind of a bummer. My sister says it makes her realize how far away I am and she gets sad. My mom said, in the beginning we wrote about our worries so much that it made her worry about us even more, so she had to stop.  I've spent most of my time lately (when not working) feeling fat, unattractive,  and insecure about my bad skin, and wondering why one of my bestfriends, Crystal, suddenly stopped talking to me.  That all sounds very depressing and I thought about taking it out... but I think I'll leave it in.  Chuck and I have been really wanting to join a gym lately. We went to Bally's for their special: $19 down and $19 a month, but then we found out there's a 3 year contract. So if any of you readers out there are from the LA area and know of a good affordable gym, please let us know. We'd really appreciate it.

      I called home today to talk to my two cousins. Just checking in on everyone. I wanted to hear if Aurora & Breanna have been talking more since I left (pictured below) I really miss both of them. Just before I left, they were getting into the talking thing.      Watching a baby learn to speak is pretty amazing. I've never been old enough to see someone grow up like that. I lived with them for a while, so I got to see her "lessons" pretty much every day. She repeated a lot of the stuff we said to her. My favorite was "me and my shadow".  Befora Aurora was born, they told Jessica and Andrew that she would be brain dead. They gave her a couple weeks to decide whether or not she would get the abortion or let it happen naturally, since they were sure it would. It was devastating for the entire family.  Fortunately, they were wrong; as she was born almost perfectly healthy. She has a condition that wasn't severe. It was corrected with surgery. Here's a  urlLink little clip  of her, post-op. It's been a while since I thought about the scar she used to have.  When I called today, she sang part of the "Veggie Tales" song to me over the phone.  I love those little moments in life when you know someone is an absolute miracle.

        Just wanted to say to everyone...YEAH, BABY!!!  The Piston have beaten the Pacers and they're heading to the finals to take on the L.A. Lakers!  Everyone out here thinks it's going to be a four game sweep for the Lakers, but I think the Pistons have enough big men to bump Shaq around for 48 minutes.  As long as he doesn't hit those free throws, that should take him out of the game.  I'm rootin' for my boys.  GO PISTONS!!!    Isn't it funny how there seems to be a pattern?  First us and now the Detroit Pistons have decided to come to L.A. from Michigan to achieve greatness?  It's nice to be a role model...    -Four games, baby!  That's all we have to win!-

      I've been dreading this for weeks. The point where I would eventually be forced to call Ted, our landlord, and ask if we could add a friend, Chuck, to the lease. I guess I was content with laying low, but I knew Chuck felt like a prisoner in his own home, so the question was asked. And the answer wasn't good.   "I'm uncomfortable with that..."  I said, "okay, thanks". Hung up. And started thinking about where we should move next. Or if at all... we could always opt for: living here until discovered / kicked out.  I guess time will tell. Damn. And I really like our place.

      Well, just as Amanda and Mike did, Chuck and I went to see  Garden State  on Wednesday.  Though we both agreed that it was a really good movie, I believe I took a lot more away from it than he did.  It touched a lot on the subjects of what's really important in life, dealing with loss, and overcoming fears and your past, just some things that really made me think about myself from a different perspective.  What do I really want?  Is it here?  Is this trip sacrificing the wrong things for the wrong reasons?  Not to mention how I've dealt with people in my life, especially lately.  I think I have a lot of things to rattle around in my head for the next few weeks.  I'm not sure if I'll find any answers, but maybe I just keep asking myself the wrong questions...

      Well, as of July 26th; I have a half brother named Dylan. I'm not sure exactly what to say about him... I've sat here for a few minutes trying to think of something to write... but I'm just drawing blanks. I am flying back to Michigan in a week to visit until the 18th. But, my brother, Nick, sent me a handful pictures from the day. I thought I should share them...      Above: Nick with Dylan... which I guess is kinda' stating the obvious.      Above: my mom seems to have that; "what do you think you're taking a picture of..." look on her face.                  Above: is it just me, or does Nick look like he's been smoking something... not around the baby, Nick.   You know, above I mentioned that I was flying back to Michigan... now, it occurred to me as I was typing; "back to Michigan", that I almost typed; "back home". But I didn't, "back to Michigan" came out instead. And for some reason that split decision has left a strange emotional aftershock I can't shake. I think it stems from last night, Amanda and I went to see Garden State [ don't worry, this isn't a spoiler... it's mentioned in the trailer ], and there's a scene where Braff is saying... You know that point in your life when you realize the house you grew up in isn't really your home anymore, that idea of home is gone. Maybe thats all family really is, a group of people that miss the same imaginary place. A place that no one can really get 'back' to, and for a long period of your life you just stay in a place where you keep your stuff... that it's not 'home'... I guess he does a better job explaining it than I do. But, maybe I feel like I haven't had a home in a long time... I've just been keeping my stuff in different places.   I wonder when the day will come when I wake up and realize I live in a "home" again, but one that I've created.

      While I was working last night, around 2am, a guy called and talked to my manager. Right away she&nbsp;was shooting me funny looks, like she couldn't get a word in edgewise with the guy. Then she just said, "Do you need to print something, or report a crime?"  Apparently, the guy had someone managed to get himself (and his car) locked in a parking lot of another branch; a large parking structure with a gated entrance.&nbsp;He said he'd called the police and they wouldn't come cut the lock because it was private property. He figured he&nbsp;could track down the manager's number by calling another store. Unfortunately, we just didn't have the information he needed. The store was nearly out of our district.  At first, I thought it was a prank, but the guy started getting really pissed off that we couldn't do anything for him. Catherine just kept repeating over and over that all she could do was give him a number for corporate. He was running out of cell phone power and was getting pretty irritable. Finally, he just said "Well, can't someone come down here and pick me up!?"  He actually started demanding that someone drive to the store to get him. My boss finally just said "Look, I'm not sending someone down there in the middle of the night to pick you up. Even if that WAS something we did."&nbsp;Finally,&nbsp;she just told the guy "good luck" and that was pretty much the end of it. I'm pretty sure that's when his cell phone died, because he didn't call back.  There's something terribly funny about pissing off&nbsp;a jerk&nbsp;you'll never meet.

      &nbsp; So, for those of you who have been keeping score, I haven't really posted anything for awhile.&nbsp; I've had a rough couple of weeks.&nbsp; That hasn't really changed, but I did have the honor to meet some really nice people.&nbsp; Yesterday, two customers, Joyce and Jerry,&nbsp;came into&nbsp;my department and asked for my assistance.&nbsp; Two nicer people you couldn't want to meet.&nbsp; Jerry was a funny guy, a real conversationalist.&nbsp; After speaking to him some more it turns out that he was the chopper pilot for the opening sequence of the "M*A*S*H*" TV series and he did some aerial shots for the original "Planet of the Apes" movie, both favorites of mine.&nbsp; He was a cool all around guy.&nbsp; Joyce was the sweetest lady possible.&nbsp; She was so charming.&nbsp; She had just moved out here from Chicago and needed some furniture for her place.&nbsp; I wish I could have done more for her, but I was able to help her out a little.&nbsp;&nbsp;They told me about a fish and chips place and a&nbsp;coffee shop where I can meet some good contacts for what I want to get into. &nbsp;She assured me that good things were going to happen for me.&nbsp; Even though I'd heard it before, when she said it, it was very reassuring.&nbsp; I talked to the two of them for about 45 minutes and I could have talked to them for even longer, but&nbsp;I had things to do and so did they, but it was a nice break from a long day.  &nbsp; Today, Joyce&nbsp;came back in and introduced me to her&nbsp;granddaughter, an aspiring young actress named Kallie Childress.&nbsp; She was just as nice and pleasant&nbsp;as her grandmother, really shy,&nbsp;but really sweet.&nbsp; She plays one of the four heroes in the new&nbsp;MGM/United Artist movie  Sleepover &nbsp;, so everyone go check it out.&nbsp; DO IT NOW!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll personally be going Wednesday to show my support.&nbsp; They're going to be moving away from the immediate area soon, though, so unfortunately I won't have the pleasure of their company for much longer, but hopefully we'll keep in touch.&nbsp; People that genuine are hard to come by nowadays.&nbsp; But if, by chance, I don't talk to them again, I&nbsp;wish them nothing but the best.  &nbsp; You know, I had something else to write about, but in the middle of writing the first part and watching "Big Fish" my mind has gone blank.&nbsp; I think maybe I'll just go to bed and finish up tomorrow.&nbsp; Until then, everybody keep dreaming...

      A couple weeks back a guy came in to print some digital photos at our self-service picture maker. He stood there for a while, presumably scanning or loading the pictures, then waved me over to the machine. He told me he was trying to put the pictures on a CD and it hadn't asked him when to insert the blank one.   What actually happened is that he'd requested 8x10 prints. Each one takes about 2 minutes to finish. Unfortunately for him, the pictures [which he said were for a class project] were of a sensitive nature. I only glanced at the screen, but&nbsp;it was&nbsp;nude photographs of someone. The REAL problem was that he had to leave - and it was 18 pictures.   So&nbsp;it was going to take&nbsp;about a half-hour to finish printing all the pictures. To&nbsp;the guy's&nbsp;credit, he slouched against a table and waited for every single one. No doubt to protect the honor of his wife (or girlfriend) or whoever. I let him keep the prints, though I should have taken them. Could have been an elaborate scan, but I doubt it - based on the look he shot me when I told him a half-hour. I've never seen someone perspire so quickly.  I'm getting used to the dirty photo stuff. I'm guessing 60% of the pictures printed on that thing are the one's&nbsp;the local grocery store wouldn't give you back, even if you dared turn them in in the first place. Everyone prints shots of their girls or guys, or porn actresses they met at conventions. It's to be expected.  Less than a week ago, a blonde and a brunette came into the store to print some pictures. In the process of helping them make a CD and some prints, I noticed a few of the shots were nude. The girl selected them as fast as she could, but it was pretty obvious. Her girlfriend (when I say that, I actually mean girlfriend) didn't seem too upset about it. They were both dressed pretty skimpy and didn't seem to mind attention - mostly directed at the blonde's boob job, I'm sure.   They spent at least an hour at the machine and finally came up to pay for it all. I didn't mind ringing them up, or answering questions for the hour previous.&nbsp;They were gorgeous women,&nbsp;though&nbsp;I had felt a little cheated on time.&nbsp; But later on that night, while I was cleaning up a bit, I noticed something on the counter. And let me just say...  24 4x6 Prints: $35 10 8x10 Prints: $50 1 CD Burn:: $10 Leaving the burned CD behind: Priceless.

      On my 21st birthday, Amanda and I had been dating for almost three months, and as a present she got me Ypsi [the hamster], along with a class cage [that was her sister's old 6 foot long snake cage... but it made Ypsi kinda' crazy, so he was moved to a small er  cage pictured below], some wood-shavings, food, you name it, she bought the whole set up.   I named him, Ypsi, cause that's where we lived at the time: Ypsilanti, MI. He loved sesame seeds, liked to sleep wedged in-between the glass and his running wheel, and always managed to get himself stuck under and behind things when exercising his plastic ball. Today while I was at work, Ypsi died in his sleep, curled up in his smiley face coffee mug.     Above: Ypsi, taking a breather on his exercise wheel, this was taken shortly after I moved in with Amanda, over a year and a half ago.   This morning Amanda noticed the fur around his mouth was yellow, as if he had gotten sick, and his back legs looked like they could barely hold his weight. In hamster years, he must have been in his 80's, he was only a few months away from being two [human] years old, which I think is kinda' rare for a hamster. I'm glad he made it to California, it was nice to have him keeping me company in the car those 2,500 miles...   Amanda and I buried him at the bottom of our apartment stairs, in the garden. He's off somewhere stuffing himself full of sesame seeds and running on his wheel in the sky. Rest in piece, Ypsi. You we're a cool little dude.

      I went to my favorite little laundromat today to get my bi-weekly cleaning done. The place always has about 10 women, all chattering away in spanish, while folding laundry and keeping their kids in line. I like to&nbsp;try and&nbsp;pick up on their conversations, based on&nbsp;what I already know. It's pretty futile, since the only sentence I would understand completely would be "Tomorrow, father and mother don't understand spanish. Turn right. Turn left. One, two, three..." It's still fun to try.  I used a couple of the triple-load washers because they work a little faster. I had loaded one completely up and even dumped my detergent in when I found out the coin acceptor wasn't working. I've never been one to kick up any fuss with management, so I simply unloaded it all into another washer, after making sure the next one took my money.   So then I went and sat on these benches at the front of the store, which are actually quite comfortable, to watch the clock for about 20 minutes. That's when a woman in her forties came in with an airport luggage bag on rollers. She put it next to the washer I'd taken my clothes out of, and went to get her quarters. I thought to myself "Well, she's going to figure this one out on her own. I had to."  Just as I'm thinking that, she comes back and starts to load her laundry - piece by piece. She'd put a pair of shorts in the bottom (front-loading washer) and sprinkle some detergent on top. Then she'd lay another pair on top and sprinkle some more detergent. She actually went through about 50 pieces of laundry, sprinkling the top of every single item of clothing.  At first, I wanted to say something, but for some reason (probably that I thought it was funny) I just kept staring. The procedure was ludicrous - not to mention my soap was still loaded in the top. All in all, it took about 15 minutes just to load up her clothes. Then, sure enough, the machine wouldn't take the quarters. I was half amused and half thinking "I'm going to hell for that one."  Finally she called the manager over and he hit it with his fist a couple times to make it work. I was actually relieved, since I decided to be a jerk and not say anything. Then the woman sat on the bench next to the door and let her head fall back against the glass window. Blissfully aware that every piece of clothing had it's own little meticulously deposited portion&nbsp;of soap.  I've also learned that I need new socks. It's never made quite as painfully obvious as when you're washing them in public. I kept wondering how&nbsp;they got to be so damn dirty. It looks like I've been washing the kitchen floor with them. I had to go to plan B and drop them in the bottom of the basket so I could bail without anyone seeing I don't know how to use bleach.  It wasn't the best $30 I've ever spent for an hour by myself, but it wasn't the worst.

       I had a nice little chat today with the guy that does&nbsp; urlLink Clublife , a blog about&nbsp;being a bouncer&nbsp;in New York.&nbsp;The blog is&nbsp;really good&nbsp;and the guy was very friendly. When I told him&nbsp;I was from Caliblog, he recognized me right away. It's nice to know there are people out there that read your stuff. This guy needs to be a Blog of Note. If you're on the committee, he has my vote.     &nbsp;   We were swapping stories about the e-mails we've gotten from girls about our blogs. Seems we've both gotten a few, and are both encouraged to keep blogging.&nbsp;There are definitely some attractive girls out there.&nbsp;I haven't always responded&nbsp;- but after talking to a couple, I think I probably should have.  urlLink Kevin  probably gets&nbsp;pics from would-be dancers all the time.     &nbsp;   I'd love to expand that&nbsp;subject into a longer post, but I've got some stuff to do today. Mostly studying up my California Driver's Handbook. I think my ten days to apply for a license are already up.

      I was going to start this post off by apologizing in advance for it's political topic, but I just decided there is no reason I should feel obligated to say, "I'm sorry", for mentioning the truth.   I couldn't help but notice this morning on yahoo!'s home-page; under "In the News", the headline reading:  urlLink American Death Toll in Iraq Reaches 900 . And then I couldn't help but wonder how many American Soldiers have died since the "Mission Accomplished" speech, the answer: 661 Soldiers have been killed since the 1st of May. But even more shocking [saddening, and infuriating] are these numbers;  Wait... actually, before I get into this, I think something needs to be said; I mean this, all of this, in the most educational, eye-opening, truth seeking, humanitarian way possible. I'm taking the time to write this post not because I hate our country, but because "blind faith in bad leadership isn't patriotic". Having said that;  2,752 American civilians killed on 9/11  7,792 Iraqi civilians killed since 'Operation Iraqi Freedom'  Almost 30% of the 7,792 Iraqi civilians we're children under the age of 14, that's in the ballpark of 2,300 kids... almost the total number of American adults killed on 9/11  *  numbers based on 2003 statistics    Now, maybe these numbers had such a great impact on me because they were accompanied by pictures... which I have decided were not necessary to express my point. Maybe I find these numbers so mind-blowing because they're on account of a personal vendetta, now proved to have no connection with 9/11 what-so-ever. Maybe I'm upset because I feel there is nothing I, or anyone else can do to stop it... it's not like our government listens to us anyways.

      Suddenly this cinnamon oatmeal I micro-waved doesn't sound quite so good... considering it's 86 degrees and my forehead is slowly perspiring.   Still no sign of my package [ see "multitasking" post]  in the mail yet. I don't work until 6 tonight, so hopefully it will show up around 3... or else [punches fist] I'll just wait some more.  I met with Pro Verbs yesterday, to discuss making a music video for their new song, "revolution (do you know)'... actually the song is just called, revolution, but Billy made a good point yesterday when he mentioned that naming a song, revolution, is like naming a song, hey jude. But the, "do you know" is from the chorus, hopefully it's somewhat fitting. I think it's too late to actually change it, some indie radio stations already have copies and are about to give it air time. Anyways, I met with a friend of the band who is also directing the project, so it will be a collaboration. The concept was the main focus yesterday and all the ideas they [Pro Verbs] we're suggesting sounded great visually, and [for the most part] added meaning to the song. Most importantly, the song is actually really good -- I was very pleasantly surprised yesterday when they played it for me for the first time. I would put a clip on here, but I'm not sure they would be happy about that.  [...25 minutes later...]  I just got back from dropping Amanda off at work, and on the way home I was listening to NPR; a woman reporting from Iraq was talking about the recent release of a Filipino hostage due to his nation pulling out it's troops a month early. But what caught my attention is when she [the reporter in Iraq] mentioned the weather there, above I was complaining about the 86 degree temperatures as I sit here in from of my Mac, with two fans blowing on me... but currently the temperature in Iraq is 130 degrees... and the every day Iraqi only has access to electricity for 1/3 of the day.   I've recently been on a Spike Jonze kick, I downloaded every music video I could get my hands on last night, including an old skater short called, Blind Video Days [that has a Martin Scorsese credit... I can't figure out why]. But anyways, I mostly brought this up because a very young Jason Lee makes a few appearances in the video, and having just seen him face to face at Ikea the other week, it was strange to see him act so  urlLink high-school-skater-normal .

      I hate writing when it’s hot like this. My laptop heats up to about 100 degrees and I have to lay my wrists right on the warmest part. Every time I lift my hands up there are wet imprints of my palms. It’s cool if you just turned it on, but leave it running for a day and you get the full effect.  &nbsp;  I had a filling fall out of my tooth in the back left side of my mouth, on the top. I think it was actually for two teeth, because the gap between them seems wider. It’s driving me insane. Every time I eat anything with meat in it I have to floss right afterwards. I started wrapping floss around a toothpick and carrying it in my pocket to work. Otherwise I can’t go near my Subway.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  It’s starting to get really annoying and my health insurance from work hasn’t kicked in yet, so there’s nothing I can do about it. I haven’t been to the dentist in a while, so I’ve probably got other work in there that needs to be done. I really hate teeth sometimes.  &nbsp;  This post is for AJ. She’s been bugging me for a couple days now to write something. To be honest, I just didn’t have anything to say for once in my life. It’s just been a slow week. I’d write some of the stories she’s been telling me, but I’m not allowed. I’m just hoping that saying I’m not allowed alludes to the kind of stories I’ve been hearing. I’m probably going to get a beat down, so I’ll shut up now.  &nbsp;  I’m still waiting for approval for time off from work so I can go visit Michigan in August. I’m definitely looking forward to being home for a little bit. I want to go see my parents and my cousins really bad. I miss the girls. I’m hoping that being there for a couple weeks will calm my nerves a little. Yeah, I get homesick. So what.  &nbsp;  I’m finally over the flu, but it really gave me a kick in the gut for a few days. I was in terrible condition. I think last Tuesday I slept for about 18 hours, only waking up long enough to drink a couple of Hi-C juice boxes and stagger back to bed. It wasn’t fun, but it felt good to beat my first sickness away from home. I guess California and I are a bit closer now.  &nbsp;  Here's an impersonation of me, mid-thought - (...)  &nbsp;  I'm gonna go now.

      This is sort of a response to Nick's comment that we need more pictures on our blog and sort of because I was starting to think the blog was getting a bit boring.   So I was gazing around the place I call home a while back and thought I would scan and put up some random things I had lying around. So now you can see what I see.  These are all of the things that I had crammed into the edges of my full-length bedroom mirror.    This first picture is of me. It was taken the summer right before my senior year. My sister took it in our backyard. The hair was a result of my trying to go from the pitch black that my hair was dyed for most of my high school years to it's natural blonde. After several tries at bleaching the black out I was advised to give up and dye it something in the middle and try again after my hair had a month or two to heal. Just so you all don't think I'm incredibly vain... Mike put this one up in the mirror.    Next up is the front and back of a small laminated card of the Virgin Mary that my best friend, Jenny, gave me. She's my favorite catholic. I'm pretty sure this was a birthday gift. Anyway... it makes me think of Jenny and her incredible loving spirit.    My mom gave me this "lucky 2$ bill". I don't remember when exactly, but I've had it for a very long time. It reminds me that my mom wants me to be safe.    The last one is one of the first things I bought when Mike and I got to L.A. While I was waiting for him to finnish an interview for an internship in Santa Monica, I wandered into this really cool bookstore down the block. They had tons of great spiritual books and Buddha's and Tibetan Prayer Flags and all kinds of neat stuff... I fell in love. I bought this sticker for me, one that says "begin within" for Chuck and one that says "Mass media breeds ignorance" for Mike. This sticker reminds me to keep fighting the fight.

      The date is set; May 29th. The route is as planned as it will ever be [ urlLink click here to view ]. Considering this, it leaves me around ten months left for pre-production, which hopefully isn't unrealistic.  &nbsp;  I'm waiting for two fuel chafers to arrive in the mail, I need to mount them onto a board that&nbsp;extends out&nbsp;just below the camera's lens for a test shot. I'm hoping the effect will be the rippling heat waves you see in wide dessert shots, but in this case; constant and up-close. If all goes as planned, it will be used in key scenes for  urlLink proj: pedal ; to constantly reassure the audience that; " yes, don't forget: it's unbearably fucking hot out here in the dessert... when you've been biking for 80 plus miles, when all your bottled water is hot and your throat is dry,&nbsp;when your new box of chewy bars has melted all over your bike bags ." I plan on posting the test shots as soon as possible -- but keep in mind; it's snail mail.   I'm getting off topic here; I started this "multi-tasking" entry to announce something completely different. Although, having just expressed my worries of an "unrealistic" deadline, I hope  this  decision isn't setting myself up for disaster.  &nbsp;  Regardless; my decision is: I don't want to over load myself with proj: pedal. Meaning that; yes, I have ten months left, but my main worry isn't that I won't plan or prepare enough -- my main worry is that seven months into it, I'll forget what it is I'm trying to say with the film. That, with three months left to go;&nbsp;my focus will have become so narrow, I'll be blind to new and interesting ideas. I think it's good to walk away from something for short periods of time to give your mind a chance to look at things from a fresh angle.  &nbsp;  But I don't think "vegging out" will do the trick, I'm going to work on short films -- projects that might play at small independent festivals and help build a [very, very mini] following for proj: pedal. But even if it doesn't accomplish that, it will allow me to get behind the camera and stay goal oriented at the same time. Not to mention, proj: pedal still needs a crew, and random short projects would / will be a great way to branch out.  &nbsp;  So that's it. That's my announcement. Exciting, eh? Proj: pedal should have it's own website up and running soon, give it another month.

      Today we [Chuck, Billy, and myself] went to the Beverly Center to watch " urlLink What the fuck do we know ", a movie exploring the connections between science [namely quantum physics] and basically everything else [mostly religion]. It was definitely an eye opening experience -- a "mind over matter" kind of thing... except&nbsp;"matter" isn't held in the traditional sense... neither is the "mind" really... hmm... let's see if I can do better than this;  &nbsp;  First the film goes into the perception of reality, certain experiments have shown than when a person is shown an object, say a lamp, specific areas of the brain "light up", but when that person closes their eyes and is asked to think about the lamp, the exact same areas react. Which suggest that the mind doesn't "know" the difference, which suggest that we don't really have a way of "knowning" what is real... which is where quantum physics comes into play;  &nbsp;  For example, in 93' an experiment was conducted in Washington DC with over a thousand people from 40 different countries gathering to meditate. Due to 48 different similar studies carried out before they estimated that during the meditation the crime would drop 25%, the police department even came forward to down-talk the event, saying that nothing short of two feet of snow would cause crime to drop 25% during that summer weekend. But just as they expected, the meditation had an un-denialable effect [25%]&nbsp;on crime. What does this have to do with quantum physics? Energy, space and time, and the mystery that one "energy" is at any given time, in two or more places at once, but when it is "looked" at, it moves to one area, or the sister / daughter cells disappear... but to where? No one knows exactly.  &nbsp;  Actually, I'm gonna stop there, because if I try to go into all the different subjects of the film, this post would be one long boring run on sentence... if it isn't already.  &nbsp;  I found out two things about Mark Maynard yesterday, one) he has a tattoo! And two) he now has a little baby girl.  urlLink Drop by  and congratulate him [on his baby, not his tattoo].   On a side note; getting epidemicly obese now has  urlLink a sleek new look  [ thanks, Jen ], so that's exciting.  &nbsp;  Amanda just pointed out that caliblog has slowly, but surely slipped down the 'blogs of note' list to last place, it's been fun while it's lasted. We all knew this day would come. "Sigh".  &nbsp;  For those of you who haven't yet noticed, there is a new "featured movie", but this one is especially exciting because it's from our friend, Pete, in Germany. Here's a short exert from his synopsis on the short film:   "The Mirror's Side is actually a really overblown version of an idea for a music video I came up with in High School. I was sitting at my computer table at age 17 thinking "wouldn't it make a great music video if a person got sucked through a mirror and went walking around in a backwards world?" The original idea was to be a silent feature, and the story line was not much more than that. Man finds t-shirt, man sucked through mirror, man wanders around aimlessly, bum says "your shirt backwards," man reenters reality..."  You can download the synopsis in it's entirety  urlLink here . It's a three part movie, if you click on the "The Mirror's Side" link to the left, you should see a drop down of the separate links.  &nbsp;  Which reminds me, recently I've been doing a lot of changes to the site, and I know that these changes don't take well on all browsers. For example, I've made the movie archives a drop down list, where you can right click on the link [for those with slow connections], and this works great on Explorer for the PC, works great on MSN browser, and for Safari on the Mac. But on the Mac while using Explorer; our site looks funked up... big time. So, I did a print screen of the site to post on here,  urlLink if your caliblog doesn't look like this , than your browser sucks.

      I just wanted to put in a quick post to let everyone know I'm still alive... mostly.  Mike and Amanda got sick last week and the flu has hit me pretty hard for the last couple days. I tried to go to work and that was a disaster. Fortunately, I have a couple days off now to get back on my feet.   Ok, well walking around and typing is making me feel exhausted, so it might be a couple more days before a real post. If you all hang tight, I promise it will be a good one.  Thanks for all the e-mails. They made me feel a little better. Sorry I couldn't respond at the time.

        OK, so it was more than a couple of days since I left off on this post.  I've been...busy.  I noticed going back to my original post that I've lost about 20 comments from the comment box, which is really weird.  They just disappeared!  We'll have to look into that.  Anyway...    So, from some of the e-mails that I've gotten and a few comments I received, it seems I may have given some people the wrong idea about my feelings on the subject of marriage.  While it's true I am very apprehensive about entering the arena of holy matrimony, it doesn't mean that I don't want it.  When I was younger I couldn't wait to get married.  I was a hopeless, helpless romantic.  In fact, my first serious relationship I didn't even think about it.  It was just something that would eventually happen and I was fine with that.  Obviously, that didn't happen, but I would probably still be married today if it had and been completely happy.  That's a different story.  Since then there have been some pretty horrible experiences and an extremely tragic event that have help relieve me of my penchant for marriage.  But as far as me being "trigger-shy", let's just say that I've felt the right feeling before and I have no problem holding out for it again.  You know, when I first started this post it was leading into some very personal revelations about me.  I had actually written quite a large post that I wasn't even close to finishing about three days ago and after some consideration, I deleted it.  I think I was sharing a little too much.    They call marriage an institution because you have to be crazy to have yourself admitted to it, right?  O.K., maybe not.  Everyone (with a few exceptions) wants to have a reciprocated loving relationship.  Those who claim they don't are probably just screaming 'sour grapes' because they don't see it as a possibility.  Anyone who really knows me, knows that I'm still a romantic at heart.  I cry at sappy movies (heck, I cry at movies that aren't all that sappy) and I believe in small gestures to show a person that they're special.  I'm just more uncomfortable with being that way anymore because it opens up an area of vulnerability.  I don't know if it's more of a trust issue or a fear of loss.  Why set yourself up to be hurt?  The more you give them of yourself, the more of you they take with them when they go.  I reached a point in my life where I would rather feel nothing than feel the pain and I think that I've hurt some really great people because of it.     You know what?  This isn't going to be much of the post it was supposed to be if I'm not going to get into my personal history, which apparently I'm fighting every step of the way, since I'm constantly deleting whole paragraphs.  So, I'm just going to leave it at this:  I believe marriage is one of the most precious things two people can share with each other.  It's a beautiful, beautiful vow of undying love and commitment.  It makes me feel so good to see a happy couple that's obviously been together for years and it makes me long to have that same thing, but I if I have to wait, I'll wait.  For those of you who are married, I wish you nothing but love and happiness.  For those of you who aren't, yet, just make sure that you know that this is what you want for the rest of your life.  There should be no Returns and Exchange Department for marriage...     -Just a quick addendum:  For those of you who know me and think I'm too detached from the idea to let it happen to myself, the truth is there IS someone specific out there right now that, after I've done everything I came out here to do, I believe could very possibly be my "till death do us part."  Stranger things have happened...

        It's so weird that I forgot to post about this, last Wednesday Chuck and I went to watch a special screening of a couple of episodes of "Father of the Pride", a new Dreamworks animated series, starring John Goodman.  You may have seen a preview of it on T.V. for the fall line-up.  It was really funny, and not all cutesy funny, but edgy funny, as well.  I would say that one of the best lines was...whoops!  I almost forgot.  I'm not supposed to divulge anything about it.  Well, it involves a dentist and an insufficient dose of Nitrous Oxide.  It was so bad that some people reacted to the joke after the fact.  IT WAS FUNNY.  The show is about a family of rare white lions, who work in Siegfried and Roy's show (don't worry, the white tigers are there, too -ironically enough, as the antagonists).  It may sound like a strange premise, but even S&R are hilarious characters.  They have a perfect mix of naivety and attitude to satire the over-the-top showmen.  Try a couple of episodes out this fall.  It may be an acquired taste for some, but I think it will give at least a couple of good seasons before NBC pulls the plug.

      Chuck pointed out a web site to me today, apparently he received an email asking him to sign a petition against the renewal of legalizing assault weapons. But the person behind the petition is Tom Mauser, a father of a 15 year old boy who was murdered 5 years ago during the Columbine shootings. I recognized the name from "Bowling for Columbine", his father is interviewed in the movie -- say what you will about Moore, but that film raises some amazingly interesting questions about gun related violence in America, questions that people like Daniel's father need answers to.   For instance, one of the mind-blowing questions compares the number of gun related deaths in America versus a handful of other countries, here's a clipping from an overview on  urlLink Join Together Online ;  In 1996... 30 people were killed with handguns in Great Britain, 106 in Canada and 211 in Germany. In the U.S., 9,390 died this way. In Japan,15.   If you have a moment... actually, even if you don't have a moment, visit  urlLink Tom's site  and sign a petition that will save someone's child's life.

      I just realized the last two post we're -- a) both by me, and b) not personal what-so-ever. So, I thought I should write something on a more "every day life" level. To begin: I'm sick as hell. And I can't get through an entire sentence without having to stop to wipe my nose, I'm beginning to suspect something is awry -- there must be some kind of "tube" connecting to my body that is pumping an uncanny amount of snot into my nasal passages...  I can't find the tube... yet. But I know it's there -- it's just too unbelievable to think that my body alone is responsible for this.  Okay [ if you're still reading ], now that I have grossed all of you out. We can move on.   I have a folder for proj: Pedal, I even went so far as to use color-coded folders [for scripting / story-boards / funding / budgeting / planning...]. I guess that makes it official: I'm a huge dork. But, in my defense; it helps a lot, and for any of you out there working on your own multi-tasking projects, I highly recommend it, it's a great way to stay organized, focused, and to keep track of your goals or necessary steps.   Actually... I think I'm gonna' stop there [I know... I know... that was a tease, but] I need to jump in the shower, take a handful of cough drops, and grab something to eat.

      Found a very interesting article this morning, that poses an even more interesting question:  are we an empire in denial ?  "The United States is an empire in every sense but one, and that one sense is that it doesn't recognise itself as such."   It's  urlLink a short article , apparently part of a six part series that aired on the BBC.

      Retrospect. I have a kink in my neck -- the kind that strong-arms you into keeping your chin perfectly level. I never get neck cramps... but today...  It's only been three hours since I was sitting in this same spot, at my computer desk, importing my Mom's wedding footage for Final Cut Pro, Amanda behind me, slipping on her shoes as she waits for me to take her to work. I can see myself running into the bedroom quickly to grab my wallet from off the bedside cabinet. I go to grab the keys from the wall rack, but they're not there -- so I decide not to lock the door behind me.  My sandals are in the car, so I hurry down the stairs barefoot. Pulling out of our apartment's driveway has always been risky, for one it's just an alley way running between two road-hugging buildings, but the real problem is the line of cars parked bumper to bumper on either side of the street. I rely on my ears more so than my eyes when inching out into the road.  Magnolia is usually heavy with traffic around six, and half the lights on the way to work seemed perfectly timed to keep you waiting at every block. I can see myself rolling down the window as Amanda holds up her work socks. There I am stopped next to the car wash... everyone starts to pull forward... then stops quickly, I get a strange feeling and look in my rearview mirror but it's okay, the car behind me is at a stop. A second goes by, and Amanda starts to say something --   It almost seemed as if it never "happened", but that it just "just happened", like everything skipped forward a second and I had to fill in the blanks. I heard a loud hollow thump -- but there was too much time in-between the sound and the jolt. My foots still on the brake... Amanda is holding her head. We've been rear ended... we don't have insurance... cars in the right lane speed back up with traffic as we sit there. Shit.  Apparently the red sports car saw everyone start to speed up... but didn't see them slow to a stop again... and he smashed hard into the car behind us, and then that car gave us a hard shove. We pulled over behind the car wash, and looked at the damage... but we had none [ most importantly... we had no insurance... yes I know, I know... We're working on getting that switched over ]. The poor bastard who got sandwiched looked out his window and said to me, "you got lucky,,,". I said, "ya know... I'm late for work... and...". He couldn't have cared less about my staying there, he waved for me to take off and started to meet the driver in the red car.   It's strange to think that if I would have not bothered grabbing my wallet, my neck might not be so damned kinked. Or maybe if I hadn't grabbed my wallet, we would have been the car in the middle, that would have been a really bad day [ and a much worse neck cramp ].

      All of you visiting this site should take a moment and click on the "cephus.de / newsletter" button at the upper right corner of the screen, read through the older pamphlets [ and if you can, listen to the song, "Two of us" by Aimee Mann & Michael Penn... no particular reason... it's just a good remake ], and of course put your name on the mailing list for future issues.  "Who is  urlLink cephus ?", many of you might be asking. Cephus is Peter, our very inspiring friend, Peter, who currently lives in Germany with his beautiful wife, Marleen. I wasn't aware until recently that Pete writes a Political Pamphlet, and has quite the following of readers. Here's a quote from his most recent issue, titled:  patriot ism.   Many historians are perplexed that Spartacus and his very diminutive army were able to advance so close to Rome in their military struggle. Other historians, however, believe that the Roman parliament at the time deliberately allowed Spartacus’ army to advance unchecked in order to amplify the perceived danger in the minds of the citizens of Rome, at which time they passed legislation strengthening the army and weakening individual rights.   It's very insightful, and the fact that it's written by an American living outside of the country [ someone who is better able to look at things from an outside perspective ], I believe gives it an edge.  Plus I had no idea that the "Patriot act" "... denies Environmental Protection Agencies the liberty of releasing "worst case scenario" information to the public about chemical plants ".  Why that is in there is beyond me... but apparently it protects me from terrorist. I know that in just skimming over the last few newsletters I leaned a lot of information that I'm embarrassed I didn't know already. I would like to hear him write about America's bloated military budget.  On a side note: I'm trying to get ahold of  urlLink Steve Burns , I have his site's general email address, but making a personal call, or writing a letter, tends to have more of an impact. So, if anyone out there in cyberspace happens to know Steve personally [and trust that I'm not a psycho], I would be in your debt for putting us in touch. In case you are that someone, who knows someone, who knows someone who talks to Steve, and you are curious as to my reasons for speaking with him: I can tell you it has to do with "proj: pedal". Thank you.

      Lucas has done it again [proved himself to be a dumb-ass]. First there was Episode I, which seemed more like an advertisement for George's new line of toys than a serious film.   Than there was two, titled; "Attack of the Clones", if you didn't know better you might mistake it by title for a b-movie.  Yet, somehow, he has managed to top himself. Episode III will be titled: Star Wars - Episode III - The Return of Darth Vader. Has he forgotten that he's been working on a "prequel" to a film with Darth Vader in it. Is he even trying anymore?   Quite some time ago, I wanted to make a short film about a group of extremist movie buffs who plot to kill a "Lucas-like" director [complete with a countless following of geeky obsessed fans] before he finishes the last of his six films, but I never got around to it... I regret that very much... I think that would have made a great dark comedy. I don't know where I am heading with this side-thought, but yeah... it's my bedtime.

      Nick sent me a folder with a hundred pictures from Kenya -- apparently someone else has a good two hundred more coming soon. But, I've picked out a few random pic's to share. In no particular order:     Above: I dunno where in Kenya this was taken... well, actually I don't really know where any of these pictures were taken exactly, but anyways, the think pink line stretching across the shore is a "million" flamingoes.      Above: I don't know why, but Nick decided to chase a sheep in circles. Actually, I would have done the same had I been there...      Above: Nick and I agree; this is without a doubt the scariest Duracell bunny we've ever seen.      Above: I'm starting to realize I should have had Nick write little blurbs about these pictures, because I'm not sure about anything in these pictures, I think this is the school where they were working.      Above: London from 30,000 feet.      Above: Nick and Peggy. I still don't know much about this Peggy... Nick's holding out on me.      Above: finally, a story to tell; the group was waiting in the bus when suddenly this monkey jumped through the window and ran around until it stole someone's bread, then it just left. I wish my brother had taken a camcorder for that one...      Above: Here's nick trying to look like he's about to run off a cliff... not very convincing if you ask me. But that is one hell of a view.      Above: The man in front is Ben, their tour guide, and to the right is "a girl" [at first I thought this was Peggy, but after looking again, I'm not so sure...] with Nick, and I'm not sure who the guy in yellow is.      Above: No this was not staged. Travis was holding up that roof frame when his pants just fell down around his ankles, and as he was standing there, unable to bend down and pick them back up, my brother snapped a picture of him [which i guess he wasn't very happy about], and I'm guess if he wasn't happy about it being taken, he won't like it being put all over the internet. So, shhh, try to keep this one on the down-low.       Above: I picked this one just because I think zebras are cool. Yup. That's all.   Hmm... hopefully these pictures speak for themselves, because I certainly didn't have much to say. Just as a reminder if any of you have questions, comments, or concerns for Nick regarding his Kenya trip,  urlLink you can post them in the forum .

      There were supposed to be three people at work last night, but one called off. I was planning on doing some computer training in the back, so I dressed casual for the night. When I got there, my boss told me to go ahead with the training and she'd handle the store for the night. I spent the better part of 6 hours in the back office, running through a bunch of incredibly boring tutorials. By 6AM, I'd had about enough of it. I walked out to the front and grabbed the restroom key.  As I was walking to go to the bathroom, a customer gave me a strange look. I thought maybe she was going to flag me down to ask a question, so I just didn't look back. I knew my boss was close-by, so she could take care of any problems. When I came back out, my boss looked at me and said "Someone walked out with a computer! A whole f**king computer!" All I could think was "How?"  Sure enough. One of the bays had a monitor and no CPU. Someone had cut every single one of the cables. Even a few that simply unplug. There are security cameras all over the store, so we walked to the office to check it out. After playing with the recording unit for a few minutes, I got back to when it happened.  At 5AM a couple walks in, gets change at the register and sits down at two computer bays, right next to each other. The guy spends a half hour casually cutting all the cable with a very small pair of cable cutters. These were pretty thick cables, but there weren't any other customers.  We checked the other cameras and my boss was vacuuming the store. There's a beautiful shot of me from above with my feet up on the desk, staring at my computer, just as they're making away with one.  Just two minutes before the guy has all the cables free, a girl walks in and sits down 3 feet from where the lady and her boyfriend are sitting. She looks over at them twice while the guy is still fiddling with everything. They stand up, pick up the CPU, match eyes with the girl, and walk out as fast as they can.  Then the girl sat and waited... and waited...  and waited.  It turned out to be fifteen minutes. She worked on her computer the whole time.  10 minutes after they stole it was when she gave me the look. I know because I checked on the cameras - but she didn't even stand up when they left to check a license plate or even tell an employee. She just sat there and finished her work.  Right before she left it was practically like "Oh yeah, someone stole a computer." but more like "You shouldn't work here by yourself (to my boss) Someone just stole a computer." [sigh] "Thanks a lot."  The computer is worth about 50 bucks. They suck. Without the monitor, I doubt they'll get anything for it. Plus the store has all kinds of security crap on it, so it's going to be impossible to use at home.  It reminded me of all the shady stuff that happens at the store. The guy that watches porn on his laptop, three feet from the entrance. The syringes and foil they found in the bathroom. The homeless crowd that settles in each night. The tweakers that come in after snorting for a couple hours. The spread-eagle posters we print for local porn conventions...  A guy using a computer while talking on a cell, a few days ago, was discussing the quality of his strippers with a client. The client was dissatisfied with the quality of the girls, though the guy tried to argue they were, in fact "good girls". Apparently his A-listers were out of town for 4th of July parties. Who knew?  I've decided it's certain now. I am, without a doubt, knee-deep in the City of Los Angeles...  and things are completely normal.

         Do you think that it's everyone's destiny to get married or are there some people that were never meant to?  My friend, Keith, got married over the weekend, and don't get me wrong, if he's truly happy with the decision, then I'm ecstatic for him (except for the fact that he did it spur of the moment after I left and I couldn't be in it).  I just know before I left Michigan there were many things in our everyday dialogue that led me to believe otherwise.  Now that I'm gone and he's had to stay home and pay attention to her instead of hanging out with me maybe something has clicked inside of him to sway him towards marriage.  I'm just worried that he isn't so much embracing marriage, as he is just conceding to it.  That's the part that concerns me.  I won't get into that too much, that's his choice and I respect it.  Let's just leave it at that.       Marriage is no longer the solemn vows and lifelong commitment that it used to be.  So many end in divorce that it's become more like choosing a prom date than a life partner.  I think the main problem is that most couples are never truly in love.  Oh, I believe that they think they're in love, but I'm not sure that most people translate their emotions correctly.  I'm sure that love is part of it, but you can truly love someone and not be in love with them.  I think what most people perceive as love is not truly love, but a set emotion (or mix of emotions) that they have conditioned their mind to translate into to love.  Interest, lust, trust, kinship, compatibility, all these things, especially combined, can give a feeling of euphoria that is akin to what love is expected to be.  'Love at first sight' is a perfect example of a misconcieved version of love (don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are people who have experienced 'love at first sight' and were lucky enough to find the right one, but only by chance).  You see someone, and before you even talk to them, these strong feelings rush through your body, feelings so pure and powerful that you 'just know'.  I hate to tell you, but that 'oh, so pure feeling of love' is actually just another form of lust.  It's based solely on what you see.  People say that love if fleeting.  I don't agree with that.  I believe love is eternal.  Lust, with a combination of other drawing qualities is, however, fleeting, even if it takes ten years to wear off.     Relationships today don't usually get the chance to elevate to a level of true love.  I believe that a relationship can continue to grow until sex is brought into the picture, if haven't grown enough emotionally together, then those feelings transfer into a whole other set of feelings and the relationship plateaus.  These new feelings are labeled as 'love', but don't have a lot of potential growth, if anything, they become harder to maintain.  Feeling the effects of a stagnant relationship, people believe that the only way to move a relationship to the level they seek is the easy way:  get married.  That's the next logical step in a relationship, right?  Not necessarily...  Maybe it's not growing anymore because there's nothing left to contribute to that growth.  Maybe that's the point where some people need to come to terms with the fact that 'cold feet' may actually be harsh realization setting in.  I had a friend who, days before the wedding, said that he knew he wasn't in love with his bride anymore, but he still loved her enough to marry her.  He loved her enough to have a ceremony, but that wasn't enough to last a lifetime, which is what marriage used to be about.  I don't want that to happen to me.     I've always said the same thing that the majority of people have said, "I'm only getting married once".  Well, I mean it.  Until I'm 100% sure that I'm with the person I will be with until I die, it's not going to happen.  If I never get married because of that, then so be it.  I know that no one knows what the future holds and that there are no guarantees, but as long as I believe it's right, that's good enough for me.  Both of my parents have been married multiple times, not to mention close friends who were divorced before they even hit there mid-twenties.  Maybe I'm more than a little trigger shy, but I want forever, not for now.     I have more to write, but I have to go to work.  We'll finish this discussion in a day or so.  Until then...

      Around 12:30 I asked Mike if he still wanted to go running cause if not I was getting pretty tired and going to go to bed. He said no, he didn't feel good. I went and layed down in bed. About a half hour later he stood if front of me with running clothes on and said I'm going running, should I wait for you. I said that I had wanted to go earlier but now I was planning on going to bed. He left without saying anything and I felt like a major piece of crap for not going with him.   When he came back I was in bed. He came in the room, turned on the light, sat down, and opened the lap top. I rolled over and asked if he would use the computer in the living room so that I could go to sleep. -no response....  I got up, shut off the light, and lay back down. I tried to ignore the clicking of the key board and the big blue light that filled up the room. I'm a pretty light sleeper and wasn't that tired but I really wanted to try and get to sleep then because we've been staying up until 3 or 4 every night and I'm really trying to brake that. I also had lots of unpleasant thoughts circling around my head and I just wanted to escape them all and get some sleep. It wasn't working.  I rolled over and asked Mike again... And again....Still no response. He had been pretty bummed most of the night and I'd tried my best to be there for him, talk to him and be encouraging, and loving and stuff but nothing I said seemed to help. It really hurt my feelings that now he was completely ignoring me and totally disregarding my feelings. I got up went to the bathroom, then came back and asked one more time.... Still no response.... Like he didn't even hear me.   I got up and went to lay down in Billy's bed (he and chuck were in the living room watching TV). While I lay there I started to seriously consider going home to Michigan for the first time. I thought about how easy it would be to pack up my car again with all of my stuff and just drive back. Live with my mom and finnish the photography program at Washtenaw Community College. I mean what am I really doing here anyway? I don't have any idea of what I want to do with my life (I know I tell people that I do, but that's mostly to get them off my back, I know that sounds so bad) my roomates and I bicker all the time, all I do is work, I miss my family and friends, I miss my little house and my garden and my dog, and being surrounded by people who love me. And I'm with this guy who has no plans on ever marrying me (he told me so) and I just keep falling more and more in love everyday.... Why am I torturing myself?

      I was watching a couple Simpsons commentaries this morning while everyone was sleeping. I have to stay up all night (even on my days off) or my whole schedule gets out of whack. I got bored with my snack foods so I started mixing them up a bit. I was eating handfuls of M&M's with handfuls of pretzels, and I gotta say - it was pretty good. I prefer a 3:1 ratio of M&M's:pretzels.   It's going to be a sad day when my metabolism finally slows to a trot.  I realized this morning that all the shows I watch are cartoons. Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, South Park, Samurai Jack... basically the entire Adult Swim line-up on the Cartoon Network. The only live show I still catch regularly is Dave Chappelle.  This got me thinking about a TV show I loved that got cancelled. I didn't watch it as much when it was on the air, but isn't that the way it always goes. The show was called  urlLink Clone High . It had a brief run on MTV (a source of several failed cartoons). I think it might still air in Canada.   The show was all about teenage clones of famous celebrities, all going to the same High School with an evil principal. The primary stars were Abe Lincoln, JFK, Cleopatra, and Ghandi. There were also non-celebrity personas, like Mr. Butler-tron, a butler robot, and Principal Scudworth, his evil boss. The rest of the students were all celebs and historical figures.  The writers of the show were hillarious, and the voice talents were excellent. It's a gem if you get a chance to watch any of the 12 episodes that actually aired.  urlLink Abandoned Pools  provided the soundtrack and they actually had a couple (real) celebrities on the show. I pray they release the DVD someday or, better yet, bring back the show. I doubt it though.  So write your congressional and mayoral reps and we'll find out how to get it back on the air. Together... we  can  make a difference

      I have a confession: I'm no inspiration to anyone.   People from every corner of the globe have left comments in our post, in our guestbook, in our forum, about how inspiring we are, and that we are so brave to have taken such a big risk [ in moving here to follow our dreams ]. But I don't feel it. When I read those things I feel like I am being deceiving. I feel like a liar. Someone who is trying to hide behind this one big 'risk' they took over three months ago.  I feel down tonight, or this morning, or what ever the hell time it is. Dazed and confused [ just not as drug influenced ]. And honestly, I don't even want to talk about this, I don't know why I'm sitting here writing any of this. Maybe I've just been working too many fucking hours at my soul-sucking job. That "soul-sucking" part was a little over-dramatic, wasn't it? Well, regardless:  Lately I've just been standing around at work for eight hours at a time, staring off into whatever... and thinking about the move out here. How it felt like so much momentum had been built up in the move, I felt like I could do anything, and then "bam!", I hit this soft cushion of routine, and I didn't even feel at it at first. But it's been creeping up on me; I've gone off track, I've slowed down and lost momentum.  I'm no inspiration to anyone: I work a boring job, I sleep too long, stay up too late, stress myself out too much on things that I know will come in time, I eat too much shitty food, I've been wearing the same pair of socks to work for the last three days... I'm normal, I'm boring, I'm confused. I'm too impatient to prove myself... I spend too much time staring at this damn computer screen, I spend too much time planning... Ugh...  Well, I feel better already. I might actually sleep decent tonight. The moral of this post is; "you are capable of more than you will ever admit to yourself", that's something I learned in cross country, and something I need to remind myself of more often.  I need inspiration, from you, do something you've always wanted to do and tell me about it. Go on a bike trip across the country, paint a picture, anything... I'm too tired to think of any more examples.  I'm glad we had this talk.

      I edited my last post, sneaking in a handful of new video clips -- and I don't think anyone noticed. So, since I love to eat our bandwidth each month; I'm going to re-quote my own post...  "  urlLink Each frame had to be cleaned  in PhotoShop, and there are about 29.9 frames for every second of film. Chuck did most of the detailing... "  [Note on the above exerpt: Chuck argued that he did "all" of the detailing...]  " ...since  urlLink we only had one rolling chair , and one pair of shoes [I was wearing sandals], we had to shoot our walking up and sitting down separately, which was tricky since we needed to look at eachother... "  " But in the end, it all worked out and  urlLink lined up in Final Cut  "  And that's that. Adios bandwidth.

      That's right, folks. Cute mormon girls agree, Caliblog is great! Take a visit on over to  urlLink Jenna's site  and leave her a comment. She's a nice girl. Spread the love around.  Last night they shot off a firework that sounded like a cannon. It set off three car alarms. I wanted to go to the beach tonight to see some fireworks, since I got the day off, but it turns out they might not do anything on the 4th. Apparently this has been going on in Michigan for years, I just never noticed.  Mike relinked one of our old weekly movies that hasn't been on the server since way before we were a blog of note. I thought it might be appropriate to re-present it to everyone that hasn't seen it.   For those that would like, it was the final project in my film course at Washtenaw Community College. It's called  urlLink y ahora muero . The file is kinda big, so you might want to right-click and save this one. It's about 10 Mbs.. MBs.... mBs...... you know what I mean.  Anyway... it stars a guy named Juan Freitez, a friend of mine who came to America from Venezuela. He was in the film class with me. He took three months of English, then left for Michigan with enough money for college tuition and the first month's rent on an apartment. He didn't even have a job, and could barely fill out apps. This guy is my personal hero.   I think it fits rather well, today be the 4th of July. Immigration and the U.S. and all that.   See if you can spot my cameo in the vid.   Enjoy the holiday, if you can. See ya gang.

      If there were a picture of Amanda and I sitting here in the bedroom; something about it would be disturbing in a "21st century'ish cut off from the real world" kind of way: We are sitting less than three feet away from eachother, Amanda a chair in the corner, and I'm streched out on the futton, each of us have a wi-fi laptop in front of us and are off in our own little worlds.  Okay, this the third time starting over... each time I get a page in front of me, I read it and think; " wow... could this be any less interesting? ". I must not be in the groove tonight. Which is frustrating because I have things I really want to get on here and they're just not coming out right. Let's try this again:  Rolling Chair Pro.'s new logo. It's been months since Chuck and I shot the original footage for our new logo, but after a solid week of cleaning the frames, it was put on hold until a few days ago. See, we didn't have a blue screen, or matte, when we were shooting in the gym at Eastern Michigan. All we had was some white sheets, and a half a roll of paper. Our plan was too over expose the lens enough to bleed out the whites. Grr... what is wrong with me tonight... the temptation to erase this paragraph is killing me. No! I won't give in. Even if it sucks.  urlLink Each frame had to be cleaned  in PhotoShop, and there are about 29.9 frames for every second of film. Chuck did most of the detailing, the files [digital filmstrips] were each about a Gig in size [click here for a  urlLink mini example / 504 KBs ], for only six or seconds of film.  Now, since  urlLink we only had one rolling chair , and one pair of shoes [I was wearing sandals], we had to shoot our walking up and sitting down separately, which was tricky since we needed to look at eachother. But in the end, it all worked out and  urlLink lined up in Final Cut . Drum roll. I give you:  urlLink rc.pro's [new] logo .  Hmm, what else did I want to mention. I met with  urlLink Eric Simonson  today, and we now have a black cat running around our bedroom. But... my stomach is freaking out on me, so those will have to wait.

      I have to leave in two hours for LAX, and I still need to pack, so I don't have the time I wanted to write a nice long post about  urlLink this [nice long] video . So, to sum it up in short: This short video covers our [Amanda and I] drive out west. Enjoy and wish us a safe flight.

      By this time tomorrow I'll be resting my head on Mike's shoulder on a plane headed to Michigan.   Before we go, I'd like to introduce everyone to the kitten that we rescued (since Mike finally got the video clip finished, which I decided to post rather than a picture since he's apparently not very photogenic). His name is  urlLink Emilio  and he was abandoned at Ikea when he was only a few weeks old.   Mike and a few of his co-workers had noticed a kitten hiding in his department for several weeks, but they were unable to catch him. The first night Mike saw the kitten, he told me about it and said that he'd tried to catch him to bring him home for me (I think Mike knew how much I'd missed having a fuzzy friend to take care of since my dog died). After several late-night chases and a few cans of tuna we finally got him.   Ikea offered to help us pay to have him checked out at the vet and they gave us some cool stuff from Ikea's pet department. The vet said that he was fine, just a little under weight and very frightened. We picked up all of the necessary stuff and brought him to his new home. He hid a lot for the first week or so, but now he's very happy.   He's extremely energetic and loves to run around and play like any other 3 month old kitten would. He's so sweet and affectionate. He loves to lay by our heads, in our laps, give kisses, and he just purrs and purrs. It's cute how much he loves Mike and I now, after only such a short time. He's not a dog... but he's really starting to grow on me.

      The other day I received an email from a reader in Germany who stumbled across a list titled, "you know you're in California when...".  Sadly enough, much of the list didn't apply to me, which just reminded me how little I still know about my new surroundings. But I thought I would list the few that did bring a smile to my face.  A really great parking space can totally move you to tears.  A low speed police pursuit will interrupt ANY TV broadcast.   Unlike back home, the guy at 8:30 am at Starbucks wearing the baseball cap and sunglasses who looks like Bruce Willis IS Bruce Willis.  It's barely sprinkling rain outside, so you leave for work an hour early to avoid all the weather-related accidents.  You realize the only Republicans you know are your aunt and uncle in Michigan.   The day I took my drug test for work, I spent about an hour in the waiting room watching "breaking news" on a car driving 5mph down the road, as five cop cars followed very slowly. Every few major intersections the car would stop, the cops would run out and then, with perfect comedic timing, the car would slowly pull away again, and again, and again...  Amanda's friend, Sarah, who lived over in Santa Monica [which I'm extremely jealous of...] works at Starbucks, and saw Bruce Willis, so I had to include that one. Actually now that I think of it, I don't think she saw Bruce Willis while working... that might have been Ray Liotta [who was looking extremely cracked out she said... which is sad, cause he kicks ass, but anyways].  The way people drive in the rain here blows my mind, and the street's drainage systems are non-existent, in Michigan it could, and often would, rain for days on end during a big storm, and nothing. You could still drive around from place to place, just be sure to carry an umbrella. But here, it can't 'mist' for ten minutes without every major intersection under six inches of water. It's a very strange site to see.

      These three pages were scanned out of my bike trip [that I took in 2001] journal, and they probably won't have the same effect on you that they have on me, but reading them makes me laugh, brings back a lot of powerful emotions [that I can't wait to experience again].      I thought the following journal entry would best be introduced by Susie L. herself, this excerpt is taken from our guest-book [March 16th 2004];  First of all, allow me to explain just what the heck I have to do with any of this, if anything at all. A couple years back, I was trapped in the small farm town vacuum..living with my best friend, Tina and some bad roommates in a state that's not my home. It was a rainy, thundery afternoon, and Tina and I needed to get out, so we grabbed our guitars, and headed to the park pavilion. (If you've never played with thunder and rain as percussion, you should definitely try it) And who should show up but two soggy bike riders, seeking shelter in the same park.'Twas Mike and the other guy, who's name I'm not sure I remember. They were real cool people, even as their sleeping bags were wet, and they were running low on subway stamp cards and not even halfway through the trip. Mike had the first verse of Leavin on a Jet Plane stuck in his head, and didn't know the rest, so Tina and I sang it for them.    Aha! and that's my connection!     The above page had an envelope taped to the top of it with the below letter inside it, sadly enough I don't even remember writing it. But anyways, for me it's so great to read this [almost four year old] letter, and then to read Susie's guest-book signature, and to think about how unique those moments are when a handful of random people's paths cross in some strange no name town, on an overcast afternoon. I don't know why exactly, but I will always remember this day -- it was right out of a movie.

      I know we're no longer featured prominently on Blogger's dashboard, but we must still have a few readers left. With that in mind - go somewhere else. More specifically....   urlLink Miss Communication . A blog from a girl that recently moved to Hollywood to be a writer. Since she's right in our back yard, and seems to be writing about the same stuff we were, so I thought I'd give everyone a heads up.   You all seemed to eat up our adventure out here, so why not hers. Remember to leave lots of comments so she feels welcome. I don't do this for my health, you know. I wanted to send her an e-mail, but she doesn't have it on her profile. I can think of no better way to get her attention. That is - if she reads our blog.  I was looking at Mike's last post just below this one. I was thinking about how he trumped my post right after I published it. Then I was thinking about how funny it would be if someone took lots of goofy pictures of an everyday, mundane activity.  The way I see it, it's ok to post 200 pictures of yourself if you're at the beach or visiting the Hollywood sign, but no one takes the camera to the supermarket, or the gas station, or to the shower. (Well, maybe some people take a camera to the shower.)  Rest assured, I'll be going somewhere today with mine, and I'll post all the pictures and trump Mike's picturey post right back. Ha! I just need some suggestions of which activity.

      I'm pretty sure Amanda intended to post these pictures eventually, but taking into consideration that she just posted a few days ago... you probably wouldn't see these for at least another month [ha ha... burn]. Most of these were taken during [Amanda's step sister,] Amber's visit.     Above: Amber had to leave around 10 at night, but we decided to drive an hour north-west to watch the sun set from our [Amanda and I's] favorite rocks. Unfortunately, the skyline was so cloudy and gray, it turned to be kinda' anti-climatic, and as you can tell, cold.      Above: I cut a goof real of the cat running around the bedroom, but I've yet to save it as a web video, so this picture will have to do for now.         Above: It wasn't nearly as dark as it looks here, but without the flash the picture was too grainy to make anything out...      Above: Here we are on way to the beach... I think at the moment we were slowed to a crawl on the 101 during 6 o'clock traffic.      Above: I'm scared of these rocks... but that's a different story for a differnt post.         Above: Ontop of the fact that the sunset was non-exsistant, the waves that afternoon sucked just as bad, they barely splashed higher than halfway up the rocks. Grr. Any other day, I wouldn't be able to stand there without being drenched head to toe.

      I just saw something on public access that terrified me. This woman, old enough to be someone's grandmother, apparently has her own show. She dances around in a bra, sometimes holding a guitar. I've had it on for 15 minutes and she's done nothing but sway back and forth to three songs in a row. I'm really starting to wonder if this is a weekly show.     Apparently, it's called "The Francine Dancer", and at the end she took off her dress too. I'll spare you the picture.   They had a phone number during the credits, if anyone wants to call. 323-966-9979. After that they had a show with marionettes called "Super Adventure Team". It looked a lot like "Thunderbirds".  I need to watch more public access.

      Yesterday Chuck and I went to see the new directorial release of  urlLink Donnie Darko  at the  urlLink ArcLight , before the film started Chuck mentioned that him and the guy from  urlLink clublife  we're considering a "group blog", consisting of all the top blogs.   My guess is they we're both just half serious, but I started thinking about the idea more and more, and I think they are onto something.  But, instead of making the top bloggers write on two separate pages [which I don't think would last very long...], I had the idea of "one stop blogging", to explain:  In Blogger's setup you can automatically email your post to an account [it's supposed to be intended for fan-mail, but...]. And recently they added a new feature where you can write your post via email, and email it into your blog [I don't get this feature, since anywhere you can log onto your email account, you can just as easily log onto your blogger account]. But anyways, how do these two things tie into my idea...  First I would make a new Blogger account [example: group_blogging.blogspot.com], then I would use the "mail-to" option to have the site automatically publish any emails sent to "group_blogging.test@blogger.com". Step two would be; all the top bloggers would go in their settings, and enter the above email address in their "mail-post-to" options. And that's it.   Everyone would simply write in their blog just like normal, and their post would bounce off the email account into the "group_blogging" site. What good would this do? People could go to one place to read their top five favorite blogs, and while they we're there, stumble onto five other bloggers that they start to enjoy.  Billy and Amanda weren't crazy about the idea, but I'm looking for outside opinions.

      We had a pretty quiet night at work. Around 3AM a nice young girl named Laura stopped in. She works at one of our branches in Ohio, but was visiting her sister for a few days and wanted to make a few things. She printed a couple posters for her sister and wanted to place an order for a large oversized color poster for her parents' 27th anniversary.  Normally we don't do them while you wait, but since she was a fellow employee, my boss decided just to go ahead and print it. We didn't have any other jobs to work on anyway. It turned into a fiasco pretty quickly though, since the file wouldn't send to the printer for some reason. 3 hours and 4 computers later, we finally had a decent print. During which time, we all gave our stories about the worst customers. Suprisingly enough, people in Ohio are apparently just as crazy as Californians.  I told Laura I would visit her store when I fly home in a few weeks. I don't know if I'll actually be able to, but it's a nice thought. It was pleasant to have extra company for a few very dead hours.  After I left this morning, I decided it was finally time to go down to the DMV and get my driver's license. So I left work around 6:30, drove home to pick up my checkbook and change into some jeans, then drove to the Office in Burbank. I found it by accident a few weeks ago, while looking for a car wash. The other thing I haven't done since I got here.  The first time I saw it, there was a line out the door and around the corner. My strategy became an early attack. If the office opens at 8AM, I could definitely get there by 7 and beat the rush. Wishful thinking. I got there at 7 on the dot and there was already a line with 10 people.   It didn't seem that bad though. I've been to the Michigan DMV and sat for 3 hours before, just waiting to talk to someone. How long could 10 people possibly take? I'd printed the driver's manual at work, and sat against the wall to study for the test. All the rules seemed pretty much the same as Michigan - sans painted curbs. We don't have those. The rest seemed standard.  Finally, about 15 minutes to open, a guy with a pulley cart came outside and started asking people why they were there. He handed out forms from person to person, until another employee joined up. Finally, a woman asked me what I needed.  "How can we help you today?" she asked.  "Hi. I need to get my license," I said, smiling as much as possible.  Without even a grin - "First time in California?" "Yes. First time."  She stared at me for a second with her mouth open and asked if I had a passport or a birth certificate. I'd read nowhere on the website or in the manual that either was necessary, so I asked if my old driver's license was ok, and reached for my wallet. She just looked away for a second, mouth still hanging open, completely devoid of any brightness and repeated "Birth certificate or passport."  I suddenly realized the end of my long night was the beginning of her longer day. She also didn't seem to want to spend much more time discussing the subject, so she handed me a form and turned to the next person. The top read: "Driver License OR Identification Card Application."  I saw a passport application recently, and I remember it being less detailed than the 8 sections of text in front of my eyes. I suddenly felt like I was applying for citizenship to a foreign country. I guess it was silly to assume all I would need was an out of state license. Maybe they have problems here with immigration.   Getting a birth certificate will be fun, considering documents mailed to my address don't make it half the time. I have a feeling the landlord might have a deal worked out with the postman. I hate not being on the lease here. I have a worse feeling that a photocopy of my birth certificate won't suffice...  sigh   Defeated - against what seemed like ideal planning, I walked back to my car and drove past the entire line of people waiting - feeling slightly humiliated. I'd stood at the corner for an hour, so I'm sure a couple of them felt my dissapointment. I'm sure more than one person was there for the second time. Like the guy with a folding golf chair and cappucino or the teen with a CD player and science homework.  I have a feeling my next visit will be anything but speedy.

      I had a great day today! This must've been the first Sunday I've had off since I started working at Ikea.   My day started at about 12:15pm. Mike walked into the bedroom, laid on top of me, kissed me and asked "what are you doing?" I crawled out of bed and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When I got out, Chuck handed me the phone. It was my sister, Emily. We talked for over an hour. I kissed Mike as he went out the door to work. Then I did all of the dishes, cleaned the kitchen, and took out the garbage. I wrote a few long-overdue e-mails and took a break to eat a tofu-dog out on the balcony. I never go out on the balcony anymore... it was nice. It was beautiful outside today.   With both Mike and Billy at work and Chuck asleep in his room (he finally bought a mattress last week; no more sleeping on the couch) I had the whole place to myself. Wow was it nice. I spent most of the rest of the day thoroughly cleaning and organizing our bedroom; something that really needed to be done. I'm sure to most of you that sounds really boring, but trust me, it was great. Sometimes the simplest things really do make the best days.  As I was cleaning I came across a list of blog ideas that I had  written a long time ago. I had been lying in bed trying to sleep late one night and had an idea I just had to write down. Much like Chuck's crazy habit of writing very random things on small pieces of paper I have a ridiculous habit of making lists... for everything! I must have thrown away 10 lists today, all with half of the items scratched off. Grocery lists, blog idea lists, errand lists, lists of people I need to call or e-mail, to-do lists, a list of the topics I wanted to mention in my post about Mike (which I realize never got written). It's funny, there are so many things I've planned on writing blogs about. I  know you're all thinking, "yeah right", but that's why I never post. I'm so anal that I won't post unless I know that I have a couple hours to write. And that rarely happens.   Anyway... I came across this list.   I'll have to explain. My whole life I've never been the type to have a lot of friends. I'm more of a one best-friend type. So one night I was lying in bed thinking of all of my best friends from high school and I really wanted to mention them. I'm sure that night I'd thought of a whole lot more to say about them, but this was all my list had:  Lisa: I know you're in there somewhere.    Bethany: M.I.A. Vanished without a trace.    Ursa: Post card with no return address.    Jaimie: This one was my fault.    Today is also the 2nd anniversary of the first time Mike and I kissed. While going through our bedroom I also found some interesting Mike stuff.  These are from the card Mike made for me last valentines day.   This is us driving to L.A.     I think this one is cute, it's his idea of what our bike trip documentary will be like.  I opened the box he gave me my first birthday gift in and the inside cover said this:   Amanda is such an overwhelmingly beautiful person - inside and out. Her desire and drive to hold true to her dreams and  to grow as a person who will better live her live in a way that she will smile on when looking back is inspiring and admirable. A quality and state-of-mind that I hope rubs off on the people she encounters. A quality that I hope she never loses sight of in a world where so many are shallow and content. A quality I hope she knows I am above all and truly attracted to.   It made me cry all over again. Okay... that's all you get. It's almost 5am. Mike wants me in bed... see, now that's why I only do this once a month. It just takes too damn long. You people are greedy.   Goodnight. :)

      I'm not sure where to start this post; I've tried a few different "openings", but keep deleting them.   I was lucky enough to be invited by  urlLink Jill Ackles  to the Director's Guild of America [DGA] second annual "Digital Day" convention. Check in was at 9 in the morning, and the event lasted until 9 that night.   Which created two problems: [one] I was scheduled to work at 2 to close, and since the catalog just dropped, everyone was working and no one was getting the day off... and [two] my car didn't quite make the drive out west, so Amanda and I are left with one car... and Amanda was working from 1 to close, which meant I might not have a ride home.   Long story short, I didn't care about either, I called in sick to work, and was willing to stand around for a few hours afterwards until someone could swing by and pick me up, thank God for Borders. But anyways, the event was something I will never forget. Some of the key speakers included:  urlLink David Fincher ,  urlLink Stacy Peralta ,  urlLink George Hickenlooper ,  urlLink Lionel C. Martin ,  urlLink Mark Pellington ,  urlLink Allen Daviau ,  urlLink Robert Primes , and  urlLink Nancy Schreiber .  The day went by so fast I really didn't get an opportunity to think about what was going on around me, and what I was taking from it. Even a day later, sitting here now, I'm still trying to put my finger on it. I do know the simple fact that Jill thought to invite me in the first place was very, very flattering. I'm incredibly thankful for the experience, it was good to be reminded that if you want something done, especially in this industry, you've got to be willing to do it yourself [people have implied that before... but it was nice to hear it from directors like Fincher, and Peralta].  I have a lot more I would like to write about, but I have to get ready for work now, so it will have to wait till later. Till that day.
