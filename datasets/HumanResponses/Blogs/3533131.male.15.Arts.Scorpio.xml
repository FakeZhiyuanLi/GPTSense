      Oh,no what have I done?I've created a blog???That's real stupid.Or so I thought.But anyways,it's good if u have nothing 2 do and it's real boring sitting in ur house thinking of nuthing.That's the whole damn purpose I did this shit.To entertain myself and kill time.Holidaes are no more fun nowadays.Dunno what has gotten into me.I've been sleeping and sleeping liek a log for at least a week d.No work has been done,no work can be done.I feel so damn useless and I'll really kick my own ass if I'm capable of doing it.I think I'll just stop here cus I guess ppl dun liek to read damn long and freaking boring blogs.I wanna go Pasar Malam!!!Yay!!!That lightens my gloomy day a lil' bit!!!I'm off. -end-
