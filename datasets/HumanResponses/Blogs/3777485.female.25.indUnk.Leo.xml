       I'm just now every busy about my assignment   cos i didn't plan what supposed to do.&nbsp;  This is&nbsp; Tips for manage time...If you can do this   You may have sometime to do what you really want to do.    "Never put of till tomorrow what can be done today"        &nbsp;    1. Plan   ahead:     yearly, monthly, weekly, daily   &nbsp;   2. Priorities within your plan under two heading:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What    must    you do? What    would    you    like    to do?   3. Write a daily task list on a small Post-it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If won’t fit, you’re trying to do too much   4. Recognize your limits: If you’re continually trying to do   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; too much and failing, cut something out.   5.&nbsp;Protect you   ‘red time’   :   Don’t   let yourself    be interrupted      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember:  ‘Good enough’  will do most of the time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Don’t   waste time in pursuit of    ‘Perfect'     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Action/Comedy :   Envy     (July 23, 2004) - -Tim ( Ben Stiller ) and Nick ( Jack Black ) are best friends, neighbors and co-workers whose equal footing is suddenly tripped up when one of Nick’s get-rich-quick schemes actually succeeds: Vapoorizer, a spray that literally makes dog poop, or any other kind for that matter, evaporate. Tim, who dismissed Nick’s idea and passed up the chance to get in on the deal, can only watch as Nick’s fortune – and Tim’s own envy – grow to out – rageous proportions. The flames of jealousy are fanned by an oddball drifter ( Christopher Walken ) who takes it upon himself to help fix Tim’s situation, but only causes more chaos. Could you name a better cast? Well, could you? Thought not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink  Your personal guide to the movies . &nbsp;&nbsp; For full movie reviews and local showtimes...

Not many pepole know, however, the his birthplace wasn't in a studio like most cartoon characters. Mickey was born on a train.      Mickey appeared in Disney's imagination early in 1928 while he was riding a train from New York to Los Angeles with his wife. Disney had jist returned from a business meeting in which he had lost the rights to a previous character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, so he needed something to replace Oswald.

            It was while running into the building in the heavily rain. Oop! My shoes was slippery…Oh! My    right foot got pain A few minuets later, it swelled up. I was sitting and was thinking about my colleagues teased me about this glass slipper. They first saw this shoe in shoes shelf and guessed that’s my shoes….The first question is “Do you meet Prince?” Cinderella!!! Me? That time, I was thinking of fairy tales. In the first of the story Princess is grueling; have to face with cruel stepmother or witch. However the story must be end with happiness. That only happened in the end of fairy tales. In real life…The end means breaking up and divorce. Recently I saw someone has broken up with her boyfriend…I’d like to say “Be a single is better” in the case; previously, she used to be cool and was feeling in bad mood (often) when she had a any problem with her bf. After breaking up…She has changed. She is lively, now J…I like that. So! What’s love mean? If your life is getting better when you’re single. I used to think about love’s definition. I just realize…that the word love no meaning, love is feeling…anyway I’m now feeling in love with my Prince…Even he is far from me 1,444 km. I always am smile knowingly when I think of him. I met Prince Guys!!!!

       I just went to Singapore a few days ago. I was missing Thai food a lot. Thai Food has full 4 tastes; Sour, Salty, Spicy, Sweet…really!!! Even just a noodle fried “Pad Thai” It’s famous here. I had noodles with soup (Quay-Teow Chinese food) not salty, not sweet, not chilli. It’s tasteless!    By the way I realize one thing. Don’t believe in first sight!!! I used to dislike Indian food (non vegetarian). A few months ago, my boyfriend had taken me to a North Indian restaurant where he thought it serves the best food. Yes, it may be the best but not for me! Cos I felt don’t enjoy eating there any more. This time he took me to this new place which serves only Indian vegetarian food. We ordered 5 dishes. I like 4 of them a lot. There are full of taste. I was wondering...Wow these are made from vegetables…how they taste so good!     Dont judge a food by sight. Try the same at another place.
