      Greetings all,  I'm struggling with a section of my thesis, which is largely on games/affect/social networks, and I've begun to find some fruit in comparing the behaviour of academics online to the behaviour of gameplayers in online environments. I'm interested in how academics interact specifically on lists like f/c and empyre, on each other's blogs, and at conferences.  Certainly, game studies has enough manifestations of aggressive intellectual behaviour; the ludology vs. narratology question created as many questions about academic responsibility as it posed about interactivity. Recently, there has been some fascinating exchanges here on f/c about aggression, and even a couple of examples. I'd like to hear how people account for these phenomena and how important they are to the conducting of our business.  I'm aware that posts starting with "I'd like to hear your thoughts about ____ " end up unanswered; I've included my own points of fascination here. Even if you have a comment about a particular stoush between thinkers, I'd like to hear about it, as research into particular events will naturally become part of the process of the section in my thesis;  - Fights and debates about the particular use of words; creation of authority over meaning. - Responding to an argument versus attempts to negate an argument. - The role of gender in academic oneup(wo)manship - Can collaborate projects create bridges? - Recent debates about "academics vs. activists" - Jostling for better job positions

       Comics:  --------------  Comics are thrashing out the metaphysics of our time in a way that academics, critics and traditional thinkers just aren't equipped to handle. We can argue over which of them is doing a better job later. A friend said something awesome in a lecture he gave for my cours last semester; that complex images have becomes the new simple images; in terms of reproducability and aura, the ability of symbols to reproduce was exactly that of language - but when reproduction is the primary form of movement, maybe you need a complex visual form like a comic to criticise and understand, to delve, into the Big Issues.    Blogs:  --------------  I think blogs are interesting because they are so much like comics; at least when you use images as liberally as I do. I am at my most bloggish here when I propogate an image I think will interrupt its viewer's visual sphere with interesting results. I want my new blog to be as  comic interruptus  as possible.  But I'm returning, as all left-leaning academe types might eventually find themselves, to the point where I am sympathetic to Fredric Jameson’s insistence that the Left (that's me, in this case) must reclaim art’s pedagogic function, and that such art must provide conceptual abstractions of how the social system is configured [Jameson, 1991]. Critiquing popular culture is absolutely hand-in-hand with the type of conceptual abstractions of the social system I want to make; at least, the type I feel I'm best equipped to make. I believe real hickory-smoked changes can be brought about by better art, better living. ..and yeah, better blogging.    Blogging on Fluffy Deleuze:  ----------------------------- Sandy of  urlLink http://strikecuriousposse.blogspot.com/  is the new blog hero of the day for this:  Or to put it another way, am I disqualified from radically antihumanist abstract production if I don't happen to like cyberpunk novels?   .. I think there's something utterly catastrophic, as a new, embryonic Deleuzian, in the way their fans present them as these cthonic space elves who came and destroyed systems of desire, didn't you know? My experience is marked by warmth; by fluffy. I read Capitalism and Schizophrenia in a hospital waiting room. Its as distant and calming as it is confrontational. Its a real breakdown, it makes you feel loved and vulnerable.  And, shit, only last week, some spotty historian from Monash was correcting me on a thing about desiring-machines. I was trying to talk about characters being so lovely that the narrative comes second (the dandy/the bishounen). I felt like I'd dissapointed everybody who'd ever read a red and white. He was right, I wasn't really using the material right, but my point was I didn't need to, I was being an image of the triumph of seeming-rightness over the details.
