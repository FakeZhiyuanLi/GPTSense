       Write your hurts in the sand and to carve your benefits in stone      Takes a minute to find a special person,    Takes an hour to appreciate them,    A day to love them,    But an entire life to forget them.      Do not value the things you have in life,    But value who you have in your life.

       A water bearer in China had two large pots,each hung on the ends of a pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots had a crack in it,while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water.    At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For the full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and a half pots full of water to his house.    Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect for which it was made.    But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.    After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream."i'm ashamed of myself, and because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house." The water bearer said to the pot," Did you notice that there were flowers only on your sideof the path, but not on the other pot's side? That's because I have always known about your flaws, and i planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and everyday while we walked back, you've watered them.For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you just being just the way you are, there will not be this beauty to grace the house."    Moral=>Each of us has our own unique flaws. We're all cracked pots. But it's the cracks and flaws we each have that makes our lives together so very interesting and rewarding. You've just got to take each person for what they are, and look for the good in them.Blessings to all my cracked-pots friends.
