      -Chapter One-   	 TWENTY YEARS AGO, I ALWAYS THOUGHT ONLY THEN THAT MY LIFE REALLY started.	 	I was sixteen years old, with a breath of a young man springing to a new life. At this age, I was already 5-feet 9-inches tall, armed with a fair-toned body and a face that could be launched into stardom. I had a clean-cut hair, one that could be considered stylish and modern even then. My facial features were the kind that made ladies’ faces turn in public places, to humbly say the least; I had thick eyebrows that lined neatly just above my dark brown eyes coupled with fairly attractive eyelashes that expressed a tantalizing sensation. Just as one had told me, my eyes sometimes had the tendency to speak. The contours that lined my face were shaped into near perfection, almost as if each detail, each bit, could be found right where they should be. I had a smooth and virile complexion, somewhere just between white and dark, that was unique and the type that matched the kind of man I was. I had one of the nicest set of teeth, though very slightly yellowed by caffeine, seldom covered by the natural gloss of my reddish-pink lips. Though there was a small, almost unnoticeable scar near my lower left jaw, I didn’t need to hide it since many who had seen it oddly find it well-placed and appealing. But I had to admit that my biggest asset was my smile. Once I cast it, anyone couldn’t help but admire, especially with those two small but deep dimples that showed on either side of my cheek. There wasn’t much more to add, but I knew I got the description of myself pretty accurate even without the mirror in front of me. I just hoped everybody would get enough impression of how a cool guy I was. 	By the end of this summer, perhaps by the first or second week of June, I would attend classes now as a Senior high school student. That was about three weeks from now. Though days had gone by even at a faster pace, I was actually never looking forward to it. Not that I hated school or any particular subject. It was just that the thought of studying bored me to death with all those problems you had to solve and processes you had to explain.  	Being a bibliophile that I was, the only subject to which I’d excelled was English, except for Physical Education in which I had garnered an almost perfect grade by exemption with my being Swimming varsity team member. Now don’t think of any negative connotation when I mentioned the word ‘bibliophile’. I wasn’t the type who wore thick glasses and pored academic books until late midnight. (My brother Tom did and was like that.) Anyway, I was only an occasional reader: I read books only during my spare time. And because high school, as many had said it, was simply the best part of anyone’s schooling life, spare time meant the time outside school hours and time outside peer encounters and after-class hangouts. If I would calculate it, it would sum up to about barely a couple of hours in a day, excluding the hours sleeping and staring at the ceiling thinking dully about nothing. I would never read Biology or any Science book that Mr Dela Cruz (our science teacher) had required us but could read Miguel Cervantes’s ‘Don Quixote’ or Harper Lee’s ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ because I was interested in reading classical bestsellers. I was a fast-paced reader that could read a 500-page book in just a couple of days, considering two ‘spare hours’ in a day was practically scant for someone who was struck with lethargy while reading. More than anything, I had always preferred hanging out somewhere adventurous than moving my eyes wearily over a blunt and predictable read. 	Though there weren’t much great places to hang out then, there were these two favourite places where my friends and I frequented every after class hours: a vacant, small lawn just outside the school grounds and a diner called Amor’s. 	Hideout, as we fondly called it, was a square lawn almost adjacent to the southern gate of our school. When we ran out of money or when I was damn lazy to treat them for free food and drinks at Amor’s, it was the place where we used to sit down and chat untilk the moon was shining with all its might. 	Hideout was a comfortable place to relax, especially when the grass-covered ground was freshly mowed the previous day. Though one in our group had named the place hideout, it wasn’t exactly as private as it sounds, desepite the fact that two sides of the lawn facing the road had been mostly hidden by a variety of thick and bushy trees. The other two sides, the ones that faced a local precinct and another vacant lot, were fenced with criss-crossing metal wires held in place by two strong pipe tubes, the bottom pipe firmly cemented onto the ground. How he’d managed to enter the place was beyond everyone’s knowledge.  	Whenever we wanted to talk about anything likely, it was the place where we’d sit in a circle and laugh and talk and laugh again. The rustling leaves overhead and the humming of the dusk wind served as our radiosas we told stories incessantly to each other, each narration carrying the same excitement as the one that followed it. Excluding several bottles that we’d brought the day before, the place was primarily empty whenever we would arrive and unwind. There we used to play the game called ‘spin’, a question-and-answer type game where one spinned a softdrink bottle and asked a question to the person where the mouth of the bottle pointed. We enjoyed that kind of game, even more when we were up to make a friend confess a truth in which we were interested to hear. 	It might not be the place that someone would love all the time, but with relaxing and snug atmosphere it’d offered us, it had remained as our secret-keeper for as long as we still bonded as a group. 	Amor’s, on the other hand, was the diner located about three blocks away from our school, at the far side of the main road. It was sandwiched between between a school supplies’ store and another diner that went by the name Round D’ Clock. As far as our palates were concerned, Amor’s served the best homemade foods among the many diners and restaurants that lined that side of the street. Even from several feet away, anyone could smell the powerful mixture of the aroma of brewing coffee and the strong scent of herbs and spices. Sometimes, though some odors might hardly blend, the smell alone could fill in our empty stomachs.  The place, simply one of the classiest the D-Chain (aka Diners Chain) had, was basically spacious and strategically the most noticeable. Thanks to the colourful neon sign that carried its name, the first and the only one existing then in the D-Chain. Inside, hefty wooden tables and low rattan chairs were orderly arranged, each table carved with the name Amor’s at the edges. The floor had dark brown tiles, so as to match the nature and colour of the furnitures that stood on top of it. Painted with fading shades of brown and mahogany, the walls had parody paintings of the famous masterpieces hung on both sides. The place had been dimly lit by wedged white and yellow fluorescent bulbs that had the effect of the sunlight at dawn. The dim lights had appropriately thickened the air, giving the area an exotic but cozy characteristic.  	During those times, crowd was at its peak during lunchtime and luckily, there were usually about five unoccupied tables by the time we used to enter the diner. The service there might sometime crawl up to a thirty-minute wait at most but the food was definitely worth the wait. The meals and snacks were satisfying, though prices ranged from 15 to 60 pesos, which by then was considered expensive for food. But more than anything, we’d enjoyed the same old endless talks and the jokes we cracked with each other and sometimes with Lena, the twenty-two year old young professional who was the owner of Amor’s. Besides the hangouts, the next best thing about high school was popularity. I was some sort of a celebrity; aside from being the city mayor’s son (which I never find, well, great), let me add that I was also a campus heatthrob. Though I’d looked like a teenybopper idol we could see in youth-oriented shows nowadays, I couldn’t blame myself why many young ladies had found themselves attracted to me. 	Like my father, I was also a political figure at school. Just last February, before the end of the school year 1982-83, I’d been elected the Senior Student Council president for the following school year. To tell honestly, it wasn’t exactly an election. Just a game of popularity if anyone would ask me.  I won with a landslide victory, having more than seventy percent of the votes, over Janet Lyn Cruz and Darwin Agustin. The former was a stuttering, old-fashioned and unappealing malnourished lady while the latter was the pimply, annoyingly cocky incumbent President of the last year’s council. Seeing there wasn’t much competition, I filed for candidacy, and even now, I didn’t know what got the better of me why I’d ran for presidency.  Yeah, let’s say half of it was because of the popularity stuff, and the other half was because of peer pressure and the privileges I could get from it. Beyond that, I could kill myself for all that nonsense.  What mattered to me was to be greatly popular and bingo! I was now the damned Council’s president.    THE MAN I HAD BEEN IN SCHOOL WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO THE man I had been once I got home. I hadn’t been the vocal oneswho babbled in front of family members without making sense. Even the things they need known, I’d preferred to keep them on my own, though at very strange times it seemed that they cared. My thoughts had always been kept secret. Neither did I show any type of concern for anyone in the family. Once I’d stepped inside our house, my mother, unlike the others wouldn’t ask me, ‘How’s school?’ or ‘Are you already hungry?’ My father, as usual could rarely be found home, or if he was, he could only be found reading financial magazines and political headlines. Never had he once closed his distance between us and talked of things that men and young men often talked ofgirls, sports, action movies, how to woo a woman in the first approach. Things just like that.  But even those stuffs had become incidentally personal to me. For the most part, I had been a loner; I sometimes even had the paranoia of talking to myself in solitude and afterwards thought of how a big crazy human I was. There weren’t much of rock music then that the youth’s ears enjoyed nowadays. So when I was alone in my room, I’d spent my time reading the classics or watching even the most boring of TV shows Or sometimes saw my father in various news and current affairs programs.  During those years, our family was at the height of its political and financial stretch. That year, my father was on the last year of his first term. Though we’d been financially stable even before incumbency, our status in life had soared to its peak from that year on. We had purchased two luxury cars and had the only home theatre systemthe latest onein that part of the city. My parents’ bank accounts each had reached a seven-digit figure and me and my brother’s savings account was nearing, too. It appeared as if the flow of money towards us was endless. If asked, the part I’d loved most was that I’d been a well-traveled person. At a young age, my family and I had toured the Americas and various fascinating cities such as Paris, Venice, Bangkok, Athens, Singapore, and many others, including the safaris in some parts of Africa. Just last week, my brother and I were each presented an expensive gift for our birthday. Because my parents knew I’d loved traveling much, I’d got an airtrip and a cruise for two to any destination due next week with a friend and four thousand pesos worth of pocket money. Since Tom didn’t like traveling that much, my parents had bought him a new motorbike. Though I received a wonderful gift of my own, I still envied my brother for his present. Not that my parents had given him that state-of-the-art motorbike; that had stirred no conflict to me. It was that he possessed that I failed to acquire from either my father or my mother throughout my life  trust. I couldn’t blame Tom for he’d been a trustworthy, responsible, respectful and above all, an obedient son to my parents. He was everything an ideal son could be.  He’d studied well and was admittingly a far better son than me in almost everything. Since we’d both started schooling, he’d finished every school year with flying colours, making my parents stand proudly on stage. With a combination of industry and intelligence, I would no doubt foretell that he would finish high school as the batch valedictorian. He had a quite outgoing set of friends, and though he looked like a ‘nerd’ most of the time, he was fairly extroverted whenever hanging out was possible. Actually, he was more gregarious than me in public relations, and I’d been surprised when he didn’t run for any position in the Council. One day, he’d no doubt be the next to conquer the mayoralty seat. He had begun wearing glasses since he was eleven, a determining difference that one could immediately spot between us. Identical twins were almost always mistaken for the other and we’re no exception. Whenever that happened, I could sense his dismay, maybe because he’d been compared to someone inferior to him.  We asked for the same motorbike way back three birthdays ago. But it seemed that he’d won the key to that motorbike since that birthday, and this was the perfect timing for him to have it.  I remembered my mother telling me, ‘You can’t have that motorbike because you almost crashed your bike headlong across the street yesterday.’ I was thirteen when I’d been told that. And upt to now, it dawned on me that when it came to the things I badly wanted, Tom was the only person worthy to handle it. Because he was the careful and I was the reckless one. Because he was the angelic and I was the incautious one. Because he was more favored and better than me. Now hear me out  I meant no drama here. I was honest that some point in time, I’d been jealous and I’d loathed my brother for all that. But I never held grudges against him. In fact, I’d been proud of what he could do though he’d done exactly the opposite to me.     AS FAR AS MY BROTHERLY RELATIONSHIP WITH TOM WAS CONCERNED, we went through an amazing childhood together. When we were just kids, he was the serious type and I was the comedian. While, even at a young age, he attentively listened and mingled with serious family matters and events, my jokes kept the family laughing when we all got pressured.  Although our personality clashed at times, we still enjoyed the moments that the children of the world seemed to experience. We flew kites in the field on windy days. We played hide-and-seek with our cousins each bright night. We playfully boxed each other like the bouts we’d seen on TV. We shot water pistols and hid behind trees like we were in a battle. Having experienced those things made our childhood never regretful.  But things changed. And so were people. Due to the continuous turmoil in the country and threats in our family, Tom, Mom and I were forced to migrate to Edmonton in 1974. And for a span of six long years, Tom and I had grown far apart as brothers.  There, we spent six years starting and finishing primary education. If there was one wish to which we both agreed, it was to return in Manila as soon as possible. Beyond that, everything seemed to contradict and it ignited a cold flame between us. We were close as we’d been at first. Things appeared as normal as they were but turning worse as time advanced. The first five years were completely blurry and each day was bound with an inch of gap. I had my friends and he, too, had a separate one and because of that, we could be seldom seen talking and telling pleasant stories to each other.  Communication was lost along that perturbed way. The invisible string that apparently entwined us was slowly severed by the increasing distance between us. Without noticing it, we’d been stupid enough not to see what was coming.  Our final year in Edmonton wrecked the remaining ties between us. As our mind started to think on its own, our characters changed a lot contrary to how everyone else had known us. His serious nature lied low and he had shown the first signs of his vocal side, especially in expressing his fury over me. On my part, my cheerful manner altered to something irascible whenever he would raise his voice on me. Patience and understanding seemed to become traits that were foreign to us; nothing ever, I realized then, could knot the ends again between the ties we’d lost. Though we never got physical fights, right then, I assumed the fact that we’d never recollect everything of what had once existed.  I was wrong. A part of it had spoken that I indeed was.  Four years and several attempts after, I could tell that a part of it had rekindled. We’d begun spelling F-U-N again and I’d always known that our fraternal illness had been administered a partial care. Very partial though, but a help nonetheless. The wound left a scar. It had only been later that I’d realized that mad blood would gush from it again.    AS I SAID, I WAS AN INCOMING SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT THIS June. Pressure was on for I must start thinking what course would I take for college. Or to what school or university would I enroll. And it was too bad for me I’d had no decision just yet.  Perhaps it was because I had plenty of choices in my mind. I didn’t want to regret anything that I’d decided myself because I wanted to go beyond the limits of my life. Back then, I believed life was just to great to miss that one wrong move would shatter me to death.  I was choosing between four great schools  and four confusing courses. Since I was doing well with my English subject, I always thought I had a future being a journalist. I wrote many articles and literaries in our school publication and I’d received pretty excellent comments on my write-ups. Though I was sometimes discouraged by my father,  who wanted me to take up a pre-law course  I insisted upon myself that I had a knack in writing effective opinions with my careful choice of words and convincing power of speech and writing. I knew within myself that I had a fortune in such a creer for I was a born critic. If fate would allow it, I envisioned myself completing numerous documentary books that would keep the history intact and mould the minds of the readers. I might hate being a politician but forgive me for having the ‘activism syndrome’ sometimes. So, I could quite conclude that powerful journalism would make a pretty good course  and business, too. My second choice was to take up BS Marine Biology. I always loved to swim and explore. I kind of fancied the idea of going deeper depths and seeing the world underwater. Even though my chance of taking it was the slimmest of all, I never dismissed the possibility that I might study a college course only for leisurely pleasure. Both my parents were against it, so I might as well end considering Marine Biology. My Science grades didn’t quite agree with me, too. But even the odds strongly opposed me, I’d toyed and got confused with it for a long time. But admit it  Marine Biology was a fairly nice course wasn’t it? If my first two choices were brought up by my own nature, my other two choices were purely driven by passion.  It was also ridiculous of me for even thinking I’d once considered not to go to college and be a TV personality. In other words, I want to be a TV actor. Ever since I was a young boy, I always imagined myself as a movie star when I grow up. And now it was the time, there was still this strong feeling that I had what it takes to be a celebrity. Show business made my own perspective of publicity veer towards something I was passionate about as opposed to adding a political ingredient to it. I believed I had the looks as well ad the talent and appeal that I knew I would be satisfied in that kind of life. If anything, I wanted everybody to admire me, fanatics running after me. After all, popularity by passion was what I was after all along.  Since I stepped into secondary education, I’d always loved to take shots and photos of the scenic surroundings I’d visited. Me and my family had toured to many wonderful places, each view alluring me to take personal souvenirs of them. Thus, created the power of camera Dad had bought me when I was a high school freshman. I became a fervent, amateur photo artist; taking pictures eventually gave me a focused mind, showing me an angle-by-angle perspective of every breathtaking site and how best could I shoot them. Knowing I had an innate talent to it, never had I thought that my passion for photography would soon die out. It also made me consider that I could much excel in a field rarely appreciated by many. Though it might sound stupid, I’d included studying photography as one of my top choices in my college list.  Inspite of how I weighed my options critically, I never had imagine I could have settled for a decision I overlooked on my list. For a long time, I thought it wasn’t there.  Only a few years after that I would understand what it meant to me.     I’D BEGUN THINKING OF WHAT I HAD BEEN THINKING OF NOW WHEN I was just ten years of age. Life then was so unsure for us and it had been three years since my mother, brother and I left for Edmonton. At that stage of our lives, I started to figure out the things that I enjoyed from the things that bored me. I used to ask myself what I did like to become, what others also thought of what would become of me. Back then, I supposed those two ideas were the same.  One snowy night, I recalled I decided to head off my Mom’s room. The winter breeze hummed noisily outside, the cold wind keeping me up that late night. When I entered, I saw Mom seated at the edge of her bed. She seemed to be bothered but I couldn’t much read what lies behind the blankness of her face.  With an inquisitive mind, I quietly sat beside her.  She stared at me, halfly looking surprised. ‘Danny?’ she said. ‘You shall have been sleeping in your room. It’s already one o’clock and you still have your class tomorrow.’ My eyes were at the floor, hesitant to draw towards her. ‘I just can’t sleep. It gets too cold.’ My voice was deep and steady. Unlike Tom, my body had never been tolerant to a very low temperature.  ‘OK. But don’t stay up bery, very late.’ There was a moment’s silence as she was about to tuck herself in her blanket. The air was offering an irresistible somnolence but neither of us was in a good position to sleep. With her eyes fixed towards the ceiling, I asked for her permission to occupy the place beside her. She replied positively. ‘Mom?’ I called her attention the moment I sat. ‘Can I ask you something?’ ‘What is it?’ she said indifferently, without looking at me. I breathed for a moment, the air coming out in visible puffs. ‘What do you want me to become when I grow up?’ ‘What do you want?’ ‘I really don’t know. I’m not sure about it.’ She sighed heavily. ‘Well, it’s up to you, Danny. You have’ ‘Do you want me to be like Dad?’ I cut her, finally looking at each other for the first time that night. ‘Honestly,’ she straightened a little bit to keep a comfortable position. We stared at each other as she tried to explain it kindly now. ‘Dad wants you to achieve what he didn’t. He told me he wants you to take a pre-law course and, in time, be a famous lawyer. You know it? You stand in court, defend people. Dad wants to see you like that.’ My young mind didn’t appear to understand. ‘I don’t understand. What if I wanna be different?’ ‘Like whom?’ I tried to remember someone not like my Dad. ‘Perhaps Uncle?’ ‘Do you want to?’ she was surprised. ‘I think so. I enjoy being with him when we’re in Manila.’ ‘Really?’ I recalled for a while. ‘I think he enjoys his life, too.’ Gathering enough words to say, Mom pulled the blanket higher. She was exhaling cold air too and I knew she was getting vexed by the way I was talking.  ‘If you will ask me again, I’ll say you rather be a book author or a broadcast journalist,’ she said. ‘Why?’ Her eyes, while she talked to me, convinced me. ‘Danny, you’ve got talent. Not only that your English grades are high, but I’ve read your poems and, what do you call that? Very short stories. And honestly, I wouldn’t like you to be your Uncle.’ I was sad because I thought they didn’t favor my own suggestion, my own desire. Silence topped over me as Mom broke it off herself.  ‘But as I said, it’s up to what you want, Danny. And besides, it’s too early to think of it. You’re just grade four and you’ll have to decide on that when you reach fourth year,’ she said. She tapped my shoulder gently, losing her interest again. ‘C’mon. Go back now to your room and sleep. It’s already half-past one.’ With that, I walked out of the room silently. I was satisfied but, when I looked back to now, I still had the same, mind-dumbing confusion I used to have then. Now, I knew I was left with few choices and apprently no chances at all. Or maybe, that’s just what I thought.

      -Prologue-    WHEN DOES A PERSON REALIZE HIS REAL PURPOSE IN LIFE? AND HOW, I wonder, will a person live up to this purpose, when everything has been said and done, until the end of his life? 	Even as I sit in the comfort of what I now call home, I still can’t help but stare out the window and wonder blankly at just about anything. It is as if even at an old age, I still have these questions that a mind of a little boy can dare ask himself. And now, there is yet another set of questions, another set of conjoined inquiry that still puzzles my mind. I always know there is an answer underlying between the words but never have I unraveled what the answers are. But for many years I’ve asked the question to myself so many times, I still don’t feel the urge of finding a complete answer to it. Sometimes there is more to what a person do to what a person really needs to understand the realities of this life. There are things that comes naturally without expectation, without any sign, without waiting for it. It is just a matter of clear recognition that one has been able to see what’s coming, more than what opened eyes can see. And for everything there is, there’s only one certain thing to believe  that everything happens with enough reason. 	I am Daniel Lorenzo and many people call me Danny. When I have my name meaning checked, it comes from a Hebrew word that literally conveys the meaning ‘God is my judge’. Not only that I find my name awkward for my personality, but I also dread the fact that it doesn’t make sense to me because it means something that I don’t believe. Well, at least, one immense part of my past doesn’t. I am already thirty-six, an age when someone typical earns himself a living, supports a family, makes the best out of his passions and enjoys a stable career. But I am not typical; for one good reason, I’m not and I haven’t been. I always prefer to be different from others and want to stand out from the crowd. For a moment, I always think ive successfully done that but as seen from another deeper point of view, a part of me is still convincing myself that I’ve indeed led a strange life.  My life? Complicated is an understatement when I use to describe it yet I think it’s so far the closest. For a vast portion of it, there’s only been two noticeable patterns  without any direction or focused on many directions  and neither did me any good. My life has been absolutely topsy-turvy; everything around seems messy and cluttered. It has taken me a great deal of time to contemplate that my life needs one ultimate direction. Lucky me I’ve been able to find it now. A track where I can sustain a bit of my sanity then. And now here it is, struggle after grueling struggle, I have kept myself normal for three wonderful years. I am now an ordinary and simple man in his mid-thirties fulfilling a noble goal for himself. 	As far as my family is concerned, ours is one of the smallest but nonetheless the most prominent in the city. We’re just four in the family but it has become extra hard, at least only for me, that we’ve lived in the shadows of politics for almost a decade and a half that we’ve lived together. The Lorenzos are an institution in Manila, where the heart of Philippine government is. That was, until the hopes has become impossible that another Lorenzo can take the governmental seat. Back then, as soon as one entered and walked the huge streets of Manila, the Lorenzos govern and control the place where the feet stepped on.  Just as many other cities in the country, we have an existing political dynasty in the city; there have been at least five generations and at least seven Lorenzos that have sat in the many political positions including the mayoralty seat. It traces back the history of our family tree, back to my great-great grandfather that led the pack many, many years from now. Someone who happens to visit the City Hall now can see familiar portraits of my ancestors lining up the walls of the hallways like an artist’s gallery. When I was young, I always thought my father would push me to pursuing my own political career. He has thought of many times that I have the potential to be an heir to the throne, another contribution to the city’s political clan. And now, I thank God I haven’t become one of them. I have never liked the thought of living in a world that’s strictly dirty politics. 	If the people in the city has chosen us to rule it for many years (for a short time that’s what I thought), we’ve been divided from our society because of our religion. We’re not Roman Catholics; our family has always been followers of the Iglesia ni Kristo Church. We’ve lived under the supervision of pastors and are big contributors in the Church. Though Manila is dominated by Roman Catholic population, we have the ‘magic’, something what it takes to keep a steady number of votes for our name. Furthermore, someone endorsed by our Church (that is about 40% of the voting population) has a more likely victory than the rest of the candidates, and it applies as I heard up to now. That has been one of the effective strategies of our family’s political career. As expected, our admixture to a totally different religious society has stirred predicaments and issues throughout the city but as the ‘magic’ takes place, the family has managed to keep this ‘business’ for a long time. That fact has more than served as an evidence for me that religion and politics doesn’t mix that much. 	I am not my family’s first choice when it comes to those political stuffs. I have one sibling  a twin brother  and his name is Thomas. We’re identical but our attitudes almost always oppose each other. I have far known that he has become more successful than I, but I often assure myself that what I’ve decided for have made me even happier than him. An obedient son as he has always been, even up to now I sense that my parents always favored him over me. We’ve just been split by a couple of hours between the midnight and the next day, with him coming as first; I always assume that can be a basis how he has been more mature in intellectual and emotional aspects than me. And up to now, it still pains me to hear when the two of us are compared, between what we’ve achieved and what we’ve done in our life. But with a deeper wisdom now, I’ve more than understand that being compared is an inevitable thing that goes with our being twin brothers. More than that, we’ve chosen to go with two obviously different careers, though I can have chosen something more extravagant and moneymaking than his. He has this gift of mental strategy and amazing communication skills and who knows? The twin brother, the Thomas Lorenzo, I may be talking of now is already a certified multimillionaire. And he always knows he has a brother totally proud of him. 	If my parents come to see me again now, I can predict with surety that I will see again faces expressing an emotion of mixed wistfulness and disappointment. I know I cannot, and I don’t, anticipate a look of pride from them. I can also recite their old lines that they use to tell me repeatingly. My mom will say I will be like this if only I tried to listen to them. My dad will remark that I shall’ve done this so I can be famous like my predecessors used to be. In one confused moment, I use to run their lines again in my mind and realize the situation they cited. That I may have been richer, that I may have been renowned, that I can have been what they liked me to be.  There are instances when I oddly ask myself questions that start with ‘What if . . .’ and imagine if I will look more troubled or even more respectable. What if I wear the formal coat and tie and carry a suitcase? Or sign papers for a big television contract? Or make sketches and blueprints of highways and skyscrapers? Perhaps life can be a lot convenient for me.  Bringing myself back to reality, I realize I never want any change because I know I’ll not even be half as happy as I am right now. Above anything else, I am more than contented of the blessings and graces I have received throughout my life and never will I ask for more or for any better. I cannot tell myself such statements that contains the words ‘If only . . .’ I’ve never regretted my decision of being here and I am a hundred percent certain that what I’ve done makes me a better and happier person. Nothing can ever change it. 	Though my life now does not render or promise any mundane wealth, I am filled with satisfaction that my choice has never been wrong. But even with that contentment comes my subtle fear of other people’s opinion or rude judgment, even sometimes coming from our immediate family members. I am not honestly confident with myself and I admit I am still afraid how people whom I know use to judge me. A part of my whole self is still composed of the words people use to criticize, down and depress me all my life. I have constituted them as the moulders of who I must be and the jurors of how every person in the world will adjudge me. Now, I always hope I’ve proven myself wrong with that. I believe now, and I think everyone else does, that God is indeed my  and everyone’s  judge. As far as I know (but I never intend to preach things that I, too, may hardly believe), it all comes down to the omniscient and unbiased One to keep the good sheep and burn the black sheep when the end of time comes. If I am to look at Him eye-to-eye now, I fearfully don’t know to which colour of sheep I am included and what will I say to Him to save my soul. I don’t know whether I am worthy to be kept or worthy to be damned forever. But I’ve established that difference in my life right now and it sort of maintain my belief that I will spend a bit of my eternity in the cleansing stage of the purgatorio, as Dante Alighieri may have said it. 	In my life, I admit I’ve made more mistakes than anyone else have. I am just human and I am an imperfect being. I make mistakes like anybody else does. If imperfection hinders a person in living, maybe there’ll be nothing left in this world to live for. Maybe then heaven and earth will mean the same place. Men and women are born to make mistakes and be human; it’s the simplest testament to which I’ve lived for many times in the past. I believe then doing mistakes is just natural when I’ve lived this shamefully erroneous life. I believe my mistakes are the unruly by-products of the errors I’ve refused to correct. And to finally correct those mistakes now is my first task after I’ve finished living my completely superficial testament. The only challenge for me is to get by with the wrong things I’ve done in the past. And now, I’m doing it in an extraordinary way, in a way no one else can have pictured of me. It may mean no difference or oddity, but doing it my own way is doing it like nobody else can do. 	As I look at myself in the mirror right now, I may not be surprised if it reflects a lot different Danny now. These days, I may not look like my twin Thomas anymore. I still wear my handsome face until today, though wrinkles begin to form and my skin starts to show the slightest hint of looseness. But that smile, as I look at it  it’s everlasting. That terrific smile has never faltered appearing in my lips after all these years. Time has tarnished but it still maintains its freshness even after ages wear out. That unfailing smile is the living testimony of my faith and the moving witness of the youth behind me. There’s not so much as a transformation except when I look further down. The polo shirt I’m wearing seems to have tightened a bit that I have to unbutton the upper two buttons to fit it comfortably on my body. Despite undergoing a fixed exercising routine, my waist has grown an inch after only two short months. I also have to purchase a quite larger pair of slacks, at least an inch and a half larger, to suit my now heavier diet. My legs have also become a lot more muscular now, with some veins running tiny protrusions just above my ankles. Thanks to my daily habit of jogging the perimeters of the nearby field from dawn to sunrise. Though the mirror has never shown it, my shoe size seems to be the only constant measurement in my body after two years. More than anything, I will of course notice the blazing aura that lights up my face each time I wake up to a new day. For three years, it contains warmth and gladness I use to have many, many years before. It has made me want to reminisce things and turn back the hands of time that seems to expire in a quicker pace. Now, it is my chance to rewind the events one by one in detailed form, all the significant and the insignificant ones that transpired coming into a new life. Each one has taught me a lesson and I owe what is happening now to this past that has always tried to approach and befriend me. 	So here I am, the product of the past twenty years that have gone by and the twenty years that are yet to come. The product of the purpose I am to discover and I am supposed to live for.
