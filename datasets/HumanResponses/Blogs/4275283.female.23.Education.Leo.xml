      So..Saturday night was my party, and it was okay excpet for the fact that I can't drink and the fact that a lot of my friends left really early. But it's cool cuz I got to know my new neighbors, not to mention all their cute friends, so that was cool. Joe and Blake win the prize for having the best time while they were here. They rocked the beer pong table and probably got the most drunk. Today is the first day of school, but not for me because I am cool. And cool people don't have classes on Mondays...or Fridays. Maybe after I start taking my steroids my headaches will go away and I can be cool again like how I used to be, when I didnt suck so much ass. The new guys moved in last night, Danny and Ante. And they are cool, not to mention some nice eye candy. They both have the phattest rooms in the house, which I would be jealous about if I hadnt turned my room into a Sexy Bachelorette Pad. Yeah thats right. It's sexy. Very pink and very rosey. And it smells like girl too. Yes people, I have transformed into a girl. Another way in which I suck now...disappointing I know, but don't you worry. I'll be back in the game, beating you men at vodka shots soon enough. Some day....(sigh).

      Well folks, tonight is the night. Its Van Halen time. Yes that's right, and man have I been waiting for it. I have had a bitchen migraine for the past 2 days, and I have been praying to God everynight that he will let me be headache free for tonight, so he better answer that prayer, God dammit! Sara and I are going; she's not as big a Van Halen fan as me, but Mama said, "take whoever you would have the most fun with" and that is mostdef Cer. So headache or not we are goin to Dance the Night Away. So I met the new chicks who moved in next door and they're cool as hell and excited to be at SC. I invited them to the party that we are having on Saturday night, the party in which we are not allowed to have according to our renters agreement. So hopefully I wont get evicted. But I have a good story planned already for Robin if in case I do get caught. I realize this is a lot of reading for all of you college kids, probably more than you ever do all year, so my rambling is finished....for now.  Muuuhahahahahaaaaaaa. (Don't ask, I just went with it).

      Ok, so this whole blog trend is whizzing right by me, so I decided to jump on the blogging bandwagon. Sara doesnt think I can do it. She says "you don't even read mine, what makes you think you can keep up with your own." Well, I'm doin it dammit...you'll see..I'll show you all. Actually, she's probably right. I probably will end up not keeping up with it. Any-whoot, today I bought a bunch of cute pink things for my room. Yes I am trying to convert my room from a batchelor pad, to a nice cozy cute room...or shall I say  Batchelorette Pad . Well, I think I am going to take back what I bought cuz something is just not right. It looks all wrong, Manny agrees. Today I had trouble trying to beat Crashman in Megaman 2 for Nintendo. He is a tough little dude. I have used Metal Blade, Fire Ball, Leaf Shield, I just cant kill him. God, it pissees me off. On a happier note, I want to thank all my friends for showing up at El Cholo on my birthday...if you were there, you know I had great fun...too much fun; I paid for it on Friday morning, and friday afternoon and night, and well into Saturday morning. But regardless, it was a goodtime. Oh and sorry Paul for drunk dialing you and yelling obscenities; at the time, I simply could not understand why you refused to pick up the phone...but I understand now...I wouldnt want to talk to an obnoxious drunk woman, even if she was the cutest thing to ever walk the face of the earth...but seriously, sorry. And anyone else that I may have drunk dialed, I am sorry too...I think. So my neurologist finally called in my prescription for me. It's a new drug I have never taken. It is supposed to stop the headaches for 2 weeks or so, which rocks. But of course there is a catch, a big one. The pharmacist says to me "the medication will make you bigger..much bigger, like you are swollen, but don't be alarmed." WHAT?! Don't be alarmed?! Youre telling me that I am going to blow up llike the Pillsbury Dough Boy and I shouldn't be alramed about it. Joe is excited aboout me getting fat. He said, "I think you are overlooking the positives of being 'Fat Meg'; I am so down with hanging out with 'Fat Meg'." Good God Joesph it's not a game for Christ sake. Well, luckily the fatness is only supposed to last for 6 days. So I need to find a place to hide for 6 days....hmmm...
