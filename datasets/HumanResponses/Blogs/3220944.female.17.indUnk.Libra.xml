      AAAaaahhhhh...!!! I really miss home rite now. I really do. I miss my parents, my astro, my tv, my bed, my lil pillows, my room and of course my darling BUBU! Aiyo, I miss BUBU sooooooooo much! I wanna hug him rite now =) HEhehe. OKie, okie. I think I just went an extra mile there.   Sigh, lectures in UCSI are horrible. Don't know what the heck the lecturers teach. They're somewhat like teaching themselves ler. Blabber out like a machine-gun, laugh at their own jokes, then talk so soft. They read from their notes only. BUlat-bulat,man! Don't know how they even became a lecturer. HAHAHAHA. I wanna switch college, I wanna switch college. Erm, this college's full of chinese-ed ppl. FULL of em! And they don't really know English. I had a tough time talking to my groupmates cause she couldn't really speak or understand English. I felt left alone in my group-of-3 cause the other two were in their own chinese world, speaking chinese. I just stood in the group doing nothing. And they didn't even bother to notice that I stood there like a total 'dungu'. SIghhhhhhhh. Tonnes of more sad cases in UCSI ler. But thank God at least that girl could smile and answer SOME of my questions. Hehe =/  Hmmm, haven't seen Eunice online in a long while de. Wonder when she's gonna get her tmnet connection in Cheras. HAha. But I still meet her kinda often. Like yesterday we (CAASI, ECINUE, me) went to pasar malam then bought asam laksa and some other food stuff. We were stuffed rite after our laksa but had to finish what we bought. Koko and I suspect that they put those ecstacy pills in Eunice's laksa cause she went totally high after eating it. She was psychobabbling and make siao jokes. Really. This WAS the side that you ppl have been dreaming to see her on. LOL. Superly funny. OUtrages. HAHA.  Well, now koko's in depression he claims. He MISSES HIS DRUMS. He's dead bored here and he really needs to play the drums. Sigh. Pity him. Wanna guess how bored he is? Imagine him playing Avril Lavigne's 'Skater Boy' and Ronan Keating's 'When you say nothing at all' on the guitar. Well, that's about how bored he is. Gosh, we both really don't like it here and don't know what to do here. GOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH :-O

      Well, I'm happy to be back in PD again! Yeayyyyy! Haha. I've been waiting for this moment since I got to Cheras. HAHA. I miss my home a LOT! Really, really much! Hehehe.   Sighh. Had been dreaming of someone for the past week. Everytime I sleep I'll definitely dream of that certain him. Don't know why but it seems that I can't get him out of my head? GOsh! Wouldn't wanna be dreaming of that guy everytime, would I? *shrugs* Hehe.  Well, college, again, was a bummer. I have to walk approximately a km everyday to college and another km back. And by the time I get to college, I'll be drenched in sweat. Total sweat. Wait, did I mention this earlier already? Haha. Memory capasity kinda low now =) Anyways, I have never been to classes on time..YET! Haha. I've been late for every class the whole week. Haha. Sadness eh? Hehe.   Gees, I'm done of what I can think of at the moment. Hehe =) But IT'S DEFINITELY GREAT TO BE BACK IN PD!! Woohoooooo. Lol.

      Another regretful decision I made in life. I regretted this decision taking up Psychology in UCSI. I still wanna do Psychology. But NOT here! Life in UCSI sucks at the moment. Couldn't cope up with my lectures. Don't even know what they're talking about. I guess the only subject I like now is Computing Studies. My lecturer's a cool and funny guy. He talks a lot of crap, and he laughs at his own jokes. HAha. But he still does his teaching real clear and nice. I could totally cope up with that.   Well, I just feel so down and depressed this past week. Maybe I'm not used to studying in college just yet. Hopefully I'll be able to get out of here soon! I can't survive here any longer de. The only thing I'm concerned with right now is that my dad has spent a lot of money on me going to college and all. And if I pull out of UCSI now, my dad will lose big bucks. We're already financially unstable, and even a few hundred or a few thousand worths a lot to us. Oh God! Please tell me what to do..   Ammah Ah Sim admitted to the hospital..AGAIN! The first time this week she slipped and fell in the bathroom in Taiping. Then she was admitted there. She came out of the hospital, but was still under some doctor's supervision. She didn't feel well after eating the medication the doc gave her. And today, she's there again. I love her a lot and I really hope she'll get well soon!   Lord, I commit Ammah into Your hands right now. I know that she's not well and she's in the hospital. I ask of YOu this day that You would draw Your Healing hand upon her and touch her immediately so that she would be healed instantly, Lord, Ammah has been through a lot of suffering in hospitals and under medications all these years. I pray that You'll heal her NOw. In the name of Jesus, I command all the sickness and pain in Ammah to leave her right now! May You send Your angels to guide and protect her where ever she is. God, please protect her and bless her abundantly all the days of her life. May her faith in You be ever-so strong! Thank You, Lord, for everything! In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.   Oh God, may You favour upon me and tell me what to do.

      My phone line in PD had some probs, so I couldn't get to log onto the internet. Sighhh. Sad leh. Well, the past week was really hectic. Orientation was from the 5-7 May 2004. But I only went for the first two days. The orientation was SUPER boring! Gosh, I wonder how they could come out with such boring so-called 'activities'. The first person I got to know during the UCSI orientation was 'CC'. Haha. The way he told me his name was really hillarious. He was like, "Hello, I'm CC...Eh? No. Not the 'sissy' but the C and the C *showing the signs with his hands*". Gosh! That was funny! LOL. He was chinese ed. Could hear it from his way of speech and accent. So, who was he to be blame for that rite? Hehe=)   The second day of orientation was a complete waste of time. But had to go there to do the course selections though. The course selection wasn't actually the subs I really wanted to do. Didn't feel nice about that. BUt dunno lar.

        Hehe. So erm, yeah, like the title, it'll be about the camp. Well, just realised how spoilt the next generation of kids are. Shaun, 14, and Joash, 12, have their own handphones already. Gosh, I remembered how hard I had to pester my dad to allow me to even get one! The world has changed I guess. A whole lot! Now, that Shaun and Joash have bonded with my koko because he plays footie in camp with them occasionally, they send him an average of 10 messages per day. You see how they've bonded?! They've even got my koko's handphone number! Hehe.    During the camp, those lil brats in my church are big bullies, man. THe brats (JIn Swan, Joash, Shaun and Edmund) play footie with a small type of soft ball along the corridor in the hotel. They run around, making tonnes of noises and almost got into trouble. Then at times, when I walk pass their 'strategic place' they would laugh cheekily and aim and throw/kick the ball as hard as possible at me. Gees, that was kinda pain. But it was still better than last time when Jin Swan used to 'jentik' me, everytime he sees me. Sad case lar. Getting bullied by kids like them. Sigh.    So, as said before..the Word was fantastic. Ps. James and his interpreter were really, really funny. But the weird thing is that Ps. James kept asking the youth and young adults out for every altar call. He prayed breakthrough for me for every altar call. I believe I ought to have a spiritual breakthrough in my life. Well, I wrote down what he prophesied for me in my journal(the official one). The games we played were kinda ,err, lame. We played the same old games that we do at ever church event. Not innovative, eh? Haha. Actually I didn't play at all lar. Most of the time went kacauing those people playing the games. Hahahahaha. Erm, talent-time ar? That one lagi sad case lar. There were 4 groups. Mine was group 2. And the sketes were also very lame- yes, again. The groups tried to suck-up to the judges by making lame jokes- in hokkien! (Note: Ps. James and Ps. Patrick understands hokkien and makes hokkien jokes during their sermons). I tell you ar, they weren't funny at all. Well, okay lar..maybe 'some people' lar. Good thing Eunice didn't have to watch it all. She was sick (you knew that) and she was sleeping in the room (you knew that, too).     **Haha. My bro told me a rather interestingly hillarious story today. About something which I cannot say here. I'm jotting this down so that whenever I see this post, I'll know what story this is about. Lol =) It's about somebody#1 and somebody#2 who have a secret relationship. No one in 'someplace' knows about it because rivalry would start if the word went out. So *sshhhhhh* kay? *Editted this **paragraph of this post on the 3rd June due to censorship purposes. I actually just wanna remind meself of this story, so don't bother getting it all figured out =)*      Well, I'll tell more about stuff that I remember some other time. Can't think of anymore now. Teehee=)

      HAHAHAHAhahaHAHAHhaha...Uh-huh. I've just known how to work this thingy already. So now, all the craps begin.  Well, I just came back from my church camp in Cameron Highlands. The camp was great. I mean only the Word(by Ps. James Singh & Ps. Patrick Tan). Ah, and mamak,too. The rest wasn't really that spectacular(YOu get what I mean). Hehe. Eunice fell sick pulak on the third day of camp. She slept like the whole day. Poor her. Eating panadols and having awful headaches. Hehe. Thank God she's up and all well now. Errmmm, before our journey back to PD, we went up to the peak to buy vegetables(my parents wanted to, not me). =) But, no surprise- the rest of our church members were also there buying vegetables, fruits, flowers, bla bla blah. Haha. Then, there were these jeeps which had 'CH' printed largely on it's sides. At first, I wondered what 'CH' meant. 'Heng Chee Peng' immedietely came to mind. Lol. Aiyo. By the way, Cameron's sweet corn's really sweet =)  Later, we went to CHeras before PD. Went to meet with my landlady. =) Nice person lar. Then, went to eat claypot rice nearby and Eunice and I started another new 'language' of our own. "Ny Niss Nanini" (I miss 'some-see-me'). Very influential type of 'language'. Guess I'm actually getting a hang of it.  Sigh, orientation's this Wednesday. Not prepared lar. But, Oh well! What to do? Hehe.

      Hahahaha.. Gees, my previous blog was hideous lar. Haha. Was actually really, really, sleepy when I wrote it and I guess I was closing my eyes and crapping some stuff. Ish. Teruknye.  Hehe. Ermm, I passed by Putrajaya/Cyberjaya the other day when I was on my way back to Cheras. THe night scenery of the whole place was absolutely gorgeous, breath-taking... and ahhh..simply marvellous! There were hardly any cars to be seen on the CLEAN road during that time, too. What to do? It was already midnight anyway. Hehe=) So, I had a really nice time looking at those nicely lit-up buildings and apartments. The KL's scenery during the night is also as equally wonderfully majestic. Haha. It was really beautiful during the night with all those lights gleaming in the dark.  Why am I suddenly all over KL and its wonders eh? Maybe I just love nights with lights. Pretty lights. Haha. But if you actually take your time off the hussle-bussle of the busy roads in KL, you'll realise how pretty KL is(despite the jam and the pollution lar). Believe me, KL is beautiful. This makes me wonder.. "Why haven't I notice all these before?" Haha. Guess I'm not that observant after all. But seriously, you really NEED to go check it out- that is if you haven't already. When I just came back from Perth in the early 90s, the only thing I knew about KL was that it was HUGE, Smokey, HOT(panas) but beautiful. I was a kid then. And definitely everything LOOKed BIg. HAha=)  Well, I went to watch 'The Day After Tomorrow'(LUSA) yesterday with my dearest cuzzie in VM. (I know, I know, we're kinda slow). Haha. That show was nice and cold (bbrrr..). I was somehow about to freeze in the cinema while watching all those frosty scenes. HAha. See how the movies get to me!=) THis was a show to promote a world free of pollution(read that in a movie review) even when most of the facts were untrue(read about this, too). So much for promoting a world free of pollution, the movie ended after one guy in the satellite looked at earth(the aftermath) and said "I've never seen the air so clean". I practically wanted to fall of my chair and laugh! Haha, okie, okie I was exaggerating there. But it was hillarious wey. But overall, okie lar.  Haha. Gotta run!

      Did not blog for many a days right now due to Der Shern's (pronounced as Duh Sien)death and England's defeat in the Euro2004 quarter-finals. Was in the period of mourning.  Thought I could give myself sometime to mourn over the defeat of England to Portugal(Arghhh). Was kinda devastated England did not win and I'm currently mourning by wearing black the past few days. It was a really good and exciting match between the two though, and England could have won by mere inches if only they did fewer mistakes.  Reasons for England's defeat (according to me): - It's the referee's fault [why was the Campbell's goal disallowed?!] - It's those DAVIDs' fault [Beckham's penalty miss & James' no-no goalkeeping which is dreadful] - It's Vassel's penalty fault, too? - Christiano Ronaldo's (Portugal) cheekyness by obtaining much free kicks for Portugal. - Rooney got injured just before halftime and didn't play after that. Anyway, England still rules! At least for me it still does =)

      It isn't a really good day for me today. Had a series of heart-breaking news for the past few days. Well, here are the updates of what I've been doing.   SATURDAY, 19 JUNE   It was a sad, sad morning. This was the morning my granny had to fly off to Australia, again. She's flew off to Australia many times already. It's never easy seeing my granny taking off like that especially when you see clusters of tears form im her eyes. It's a heart-breaker. My cousin says she flies in airplanes just like taking a cab. And, I believe that statement IS true. She even flies more often than me having rides in taxis. Well, I really miss her right now. I wonder when will I get to see her again? Hhmm, my granny has been back to Malaysia quite frequently these few years. She can't actually come back to Malaysia that often cause the Australian customs and immigrations board thingy wouldn't allow. She's a senior citizen there. So, might not be seeing her in a while, unless, my uncle sends her here again =)  At night, went to Yatch Club for my friend's so-called birthday dinner. It's actually an ex-classmates gathering cum birthday celebration. She celebrated her birthday de, but since she wanted to ' cheng ' us... what's the harm, right? Got to meet up with my dear friends whom I've not seen in a while(something like 6 months). Caught up with the rush they've been thru and the rush they are going to go thru and learned a lot. Zi Hui's going to France and Hadi's going to Korea, both within 3 months time. Know some are going to Australia and US but they're still studying here. Maybe complete their foundation first. A cluster's in Form 6, the rest are in MMU, Sunway, Taylor's, INTI Nilai (and me, all alone in UCSI). Laine was the one who updated me with the many  news  and erm,  gossips .  Had to hang with Elaine and her family in Yatch Club before that dinner. Just found out that Laine has lupus(a disease). The doctors didn't even tell her why she was on steroids and she only found out later. Could see her hair falling out, really kesian. Once, when I was watching TV, I stumbled upon a show(cover story). It was about this model who had a younger sister who died suddenly at the age of 17. She died of a rare blood disease, which symptoms are similar to that of Laine's. I got so freaked out and prayed that Laine would not end up like that.  For those reading this, please, please pray for Elaine's total recovery, too.    SUNDAY, 20 JUNE   Today's Father's Day. Nothing much happened today except for the typical short presentations in church. THen, hhmm, really.. it was like every other Sunday.   MONDAY, 21 JUNE   It's mommy birthday! Same goes to Prince William, well, that's what my mom tells me everytime it's HER birthday. Didn't get her anything cause she says she doesn't want one. But we brought her shopping though. Shop at where??? Yeah, you're right. In Vid Malley. She bought some stuff there. Had dinner at Pizza HUt and ate the all new assam laksa splitzza. Tasted okay lar, but had this weird taste after a few hours. It doesn't really tastes like laksa also lar. Anyways, HaPPY BiRTHDaY, MOMMY!   TODAY, 22 JUNE   Woke up like the usual 7 something to send my parents off at the door. Then went back to sleep.   KOko woke me up at 11 something for fun (his usual stunt). He was crapping some stuff and asked me a weird question. Well, he always does that these days. He asked me what if I read a news in the newspaper about his death in a car accident. I quickly shouted "NO lar. Cannot wan" and of course, who wants their dear family members to die, right?  After watching TV and eating my breakfast, I got a call from mom. It was a shoking yet another  heart-breaking  news. Der Shern, has gone to be with the LOrd. He's this cute lil guy who suffers from leukemia. He was so young, I don't think he's even 10. When I heard the news, I was shocked but I don't know how I should feel. Felt like crying but yet I'm thankful that GOd took him away so that he should suffer no more. Der Shern used to be a cheerful, playful kid- like any other. He would run around in church and he just has this adorable smile. But this was before he was inflicted with the disease. At first, he pulled thru a number of operations successfully and went thru some painful therapies. He did the bone-marrow transplant which is very, very painful (how much more would it be for a child like him?). Even then, we heard great news from his parents that he was recovering and on his way to being a normal kid. He sang for us a song in church with his dad on the guitar. Many of us were touched by their performance but who would have guessed it would be his last? I truly admire him for being braver than many of us are. Salutes! And, I sincerely believe he's having the time of his life up there. May his parents be strong in the Lord and never give up faith. God bless their family!

      Well, well, well. So much for staying up late last night, studying. The dumb ol' me couldn't get up early enough to sit for her mid-term! Yes, you've got it right. I WOKE UP LATE. Was supposed to wake up at 7am today, but instead I woke up 2 and a half hours later. Got up, blaming myself for missing my Malaysian Studies paper and I wonder whether I'll be able to sit for a retake since my lecturer once said she'll never let anyone who doesn't come on the day of the exam to have a retake. Sigh. Stupid, stupid me! Arghhh. I think I'll go see her next week, that is, if I ever get to find her. Hhmm, well, all thanks to my EUro04 fever also ler. Why did England have to play last night? Why? Gosh! But anyways, thank God England won the match last night. (woohoo!) =) Hahahahahahahahahha.

      Haha. It's amazing how the 'football fever' could get to you. Hehe. Have been watching some matches of the Euro2004 (England vs. France, in particular) and I find it quite fun watching football, which I won't usually feel when I watch the EPL or whatever leagues similar. Hhmm, usually will get this 'fever' whenever all these major championships takes place (i.e. WorldCup and EuroCup). And I'll always be on England's side. Don't know why. Perhaps cause there's Owen or Beckham? Or maybe I'm just under the influence of my dad and koko? *shrugs* =)  Well, haven't been watching much TV serials lately. All props to the Euro04 which takes up much TV time. Sigh. THey don't show much on TV nowadays because of it. Seriously, one sad case ler. Koko's 'gian' over the PS again. Just started liking the 'This Is Football' game he bought over a week ago. He plays it most of the time so, much of my TV time is 'stolen' by him. Sadness. I think I should start playing my RPGs soon. Then, he'll have to rebut with me. WUahahahahahahaa.. Wait lar, after my exams I'll be playing PS 24/7. =)  Ish. I've another paper to go this Friday. Better be off studying.

If I got anything to state, I'll do so later in the day/nite. I better be off studying now. God bless you bloggers! =)

      My youth group had this street ministry thingy last Saturday in Petaling Street. This street ministry thingy is actually under some christian organisation, I think. Well, what I know of is that other churches participated also. We didn't have to do anything much because they said they had enough volunteers to help them out and all we need to do was to OBSERVE. Haha. I guess, we didn't do much observing either. We talked more than we did observing. HEhe. Ann and I had quite a laugh talking about some of the weird contestants in the Malaysian Idol. Pity Charis who stood there blurly, not having a clue about what we talked. Hehe. Hhmm, it was actually kinda gross observing the ministry, felt like vomitting. We stood near the medical aid booth and the volunteers had to clean up, apply medication and wrap the wounds the beggars had. YOu know lar, all the beggars have lots of infected types of wounds *blechhh* Overall, it was definitely a great exposure to us all.  Grace was the one who picked koko and I up from the condo. One of her front teeth was broken something like into half. So kesian lar. She said she fell down after donating blood in a hospital. Her cancer-striken boss' father needed some blood so off she went to donate. After the donation, she was supposed to rest for about 15-30 minutes and drink a whole cup of Milo. But she said she wanted to be some sort of a 'hero' (heroine actually) cause she drank only 2 sips of Milo and started walking around the whole hospital after 5 minutes of resting. So, she walked and walked and walked till she wanted to go back so she met up with her collegues and walked to the lift. She held onto the wall and felt giddy that time. Her collegue asked her whether she was okay or not and she said, " I want to peng..." And there she fell(blacked out) AND broke her teeth. It seems like a good deed doesn't deserve another after all. Poor her. SIgh. Another misfortune happened when Grace was was involved in a minor accident on our way to Petaling Street. She was accused(I think) of hitting a taxi when all of us(in the car) didn't hear a thing. The taxi driver claims for some money and says if she doesn't wanna pay him, he'll report to the police. And worst of all, it was his fault the accident occured. Sigh. Pity Grace lar. Tsk tsk tsk.  Well, it wasn't the end of the day for us yet. Hehe. We went to Berjaya Times Square (NO, not for the Malaysian Idol auditions) to shop. THe younger youths went to the indoor theme park. My group(Ann, Cindy, Grace, Charis and I) were just taking our time walking in and out of shops. We bought some stuff also lar. Hehe. We decided to take a lil sneek peek of the auditions that were held there(7th floor, if I've not mistaken). So we walked and were surprised enough to see the CUTE Jien there *grin* Haha. He was walking out of the audition room and those cameras all eyed on him for a moment. Ann was walking too far in front so we had to catch up with her. Charis, on the other hand, displayed a side of her I've never seen before. She was somewhat 'high' over Jien. She kept bugging me to go nearer to him because she wants to have a closer look at him. Haha. I was like so amazed at that point. =)  So, hmm. I got back to PD later that night and boy, was I glad to see HOME again! HOme, Home, Home, Home, HOme. Hehe. But too bad, I'm not at home already. In UCSI again and just did my 2nd test for my Computing Studies. It was kinda okay lar. But don't know whether I did it the right way or not. Haha. I'll leave it all into God's hands lar. And I guess I'll leave you into God's hands, too. God bless! =)

      Is it that difficult to pronounce the word 'aletheia'? Or is it even difficult to remember it? Huh? HUH? I get so bummed when people can't seem to pronounce it all right. Especially when they keep asking me to repeat it over and over and over and over again. I am particularly bummed today over the fact that I had to say my name (name's ALetheia - for those who don't know) a whole lot of times in one of the society club meetings in college. They were actually nominating students to become part of the commitee but only 8 turned up out of 50 members. So, almost all of us had to hold some posts in the club. Good thing I didn't have one. But then, we didn't really know each other to nominate so the ex-Vpresident asked each of us to intro ourselves. And again, I was the last to do so. When the time came for me to SAY MY NAME... (you should have known what had happened by now =/) I said it lar.  Here's how it goes after he introduces everyone else.  Ex-Vpres : And you? (looking at me) What's your name? Me      : Aletheia. Ex-Vpres : Huh? Me      : Aletheia. Ex-Vpres : Huh? Me      : Ale..theia. Ex-Vpres : Huh? What?  Me      : (raising my voice a lil) AleTHEIA. Ex-Vpres : Ale..(suggests a 'weird sound') WHat? Me      : (feeling like choking him) ALE..THEIA! Ex-Vpres : Aledya? Me      : (pauses a while) Ummm.. A friend sitting next to me tries helping me out by saying it again and then spelling it to him. Ex-Vpres : Oohh, I see. Aletheia? Me      : (ah, finally!) Uh-huh. Having thought that he finally got my name, the ex-Vpres went on by explaining what responsibilities the person of the certain post would hold. Later, during FAQ and nomination time, when everyone was kinda making a lot of noise, he asked me how to pronounce my name again. I was like, what?! He didn't get my name? So, here we go again. I say Aletheia and he tries to follow me but fails. Second attempt; fails. Third attempt; FAILS again. And at last, he got it on the fourth attempt. GOsh! This makes me wanna suffocate. LOL.  By the way, you pronounce 'aletheia' as 'L-E-tier' or 'L-E-thia' or 'al-ay-thia'. But preferably 'L-E-tier' =). Hehe. Might seem kinda strict with my name saying, eh? Mom taught me once that names are really important, better respect names and not make fun of 'em. Hehe. And if you really wanna know what 'aletheia' means, well, it actually means TRUTH, in Greek. It was written in the Greek New Testiment.

      Sigh. I'm so sleepy right now. I wanna sleep. But I can't, cause I'm in the computer lab AGAIN! NOwadays, I go there kinda often. Hhmm, got nothing else better to do I guess.   Well, why am I sleepy? Firstly, didn't get enough sleep last night. EUnice darling called. Then, later had to bathe and wait for my hair to dry before I could go to sleep. So, it was already 3pm by then. Hehe. But really had fun talking to Eunice on the phone. She makes funny sentences and noises when she talks. Cute eh? =) Hehe. Secondly, I had to wake up at 7am today cause lextures starts at 8.30am. Was supposed to leave at 8am cause I had to walk to college, but then I left later so was kinda late for lectures, again! HAHA. Thirdly, had been walking around the campus and the mall right up till now. I mean cause Eunice and I had nothing else to do and it was raining. Couldn't go back to her place in the rain. Fourthly, I'm having lectures the whole day (literally) but with huge breaks in between. So, couldn't go back to rest or sleep or whatsoever. Lectures here are boring, too. Was 'crying' in class because I was yawning too much. Hehe. Fifthly, I think I ate too much. Did I? Or was I dreaming? =) Sixthly, I..hhmm...I...wait, wait, wait.. Why am I placing them in sequences? THey all sound alike what. I have no idea. Haha.   Erm, my vision's getting all blurry now. Can't really see what's on the screen. I need to sleep. ZZzzZZZZZzZzzzZZzzz.....

      Hehe. Well, koko told me something today. Erm, he actually tells me a lot of things everyday =) but what he told me today got me all funnily excited. Hehe. I feel like laughing non-stop lar. YOu definitely know about the Malaysian Idol auditions that are taking place here in Malaysia now rite? Well, I was told that many people(youths) in GTKlang are auditioning for it. I mean just for the fun of it, since the registeration's free anyway. They somewhat pakat-ed to go in one big gang. Coolness! See how sporting and yet united they all are. Aawwww. Hehe. But might some just wanna enter to get their 5 minutes of fame? Who knows? Haha. So, I wouldn't wanna be missing Malaysian Idol now, would I? Guess not =) Can't wait to watch it. Wanna see who would manage to enter the finals as many of the GTKlang(ites?) are really good at singing. GTKlang was where Guy Sebastian(Australian Idol) came from, too. He and his family used to attend there till they migrated to Australia. Hehe. BOy, speaking of GTKlang, I kinda miss those sweet memories I had there. With my darling friends whom I've not met in ages. *sniff sniff*  HHmmm. Oh yeah. Just read Eunice's blog today and she says that her koko JIreh will be back from Canada soon! Sometime next month I think. Anyways, Yeayy! Haha. Really happy for her. You know, she cries in her sleep when she dreams of her dear koko. Awww, ain't that sweet? Hehe. Wonder if she would hug her koko or not once she gets to see him?=) Ah, yah! Kah Chun has left for UK last Friday. Eunice said he'll be there for only about 4 months, I think. Studying, I guess. So, there you have it! A family that flies about. Hehehehahahahahah.

      Sigh. All my quizzes, tests, mid-terms are nearing. Hhmm, actually did my Calculus test today. Had only a few questions in them, so it wasn't THAT stressful to do. (I have the fear of Maths tests/exams. Giving me a lot of questions about Maths/Add Math, might make my head blow!) Hehe. Well, I do get butterflies in my stomach whenever I have to sit for an exam. I'm never prepared, and I'll hardly do well. Sad eh? HAha. And it's all my fault, too. (Ah! Don't wanna study lar!) =) Did my Computing studies' test last 2 weeks. That was kinda easy but I didn't score full marks all to my stupidity in Maths (Haha. Told you!) I did something wrong in my calculations so that's where I lost my precious 2 marks. Sigh. HEhe.  Ermm, koko's started working today. In a lab somewhere in (Sri Rampai?). Ah, somewhere there lar. He's doing something to do with bridges&crowns. Hehe. If you don't know what that is, it has something to do with teeth *bling bling*. So, since he's working de, I have to get to the new and old campus all by myself *sniff sniff*. So, hehehe, I'll be ever so late for classes again! WuahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA =)  Okie lar. Dad's here to pick me up from the computer lab de. My blog of the day.

      I realise I am easily addicted or obsessed with stuff. I can get attached to something and I wouldn't be bothered at all about the things around me. Try talking to me when I'm watching TV. No matter what's nice or not on the silver screen, I'll just keep watching cause my brain doesn't seem to register anything anyone says. I probably seem like a zombie. Sometimes, I wouldn't even realise that someone's talking to me until I kena belasah. But I love watching TV. I definitely have something to watch on TV(Astro) every single minute of the day. I might even have clashes in shows or movies occasionally. Hehe. Same goes to when I play PS or when I read something online. Currently obsessed with Pacman and I'm dying to finish my Final Fantasy VIII which I've been playing on and off for the past 4 years. Gosh! 4 years. And I've just finished the first disc. 3 more to go. But the accumulated time of play is only about 15 hrs (first disc). Hehe. Note that I play the same rounds in FFVIII over and over again. So, all together it'll be around 30 hrs++ per disc? Sad fler eh? =) Hmm. I think I might be a caffein addict, too. Have to drink coffee (or tea) at least once a week. Blame it on the genes! My parents are heavy caffein addicts. Especially my dad who couldn't live a day peacefully without a cup of piping hot coffee. Hehe. I know, I know. These are ALL bad habits. NO wonder I never had the time to study for my exams. Haha.  Well, read a Reader's Digest(Nov'2000) story entitled 'The Fight To Free My Son'. It's a wonderful and touching story by Joyce Milgaard about her fight to free her falsely accused son for rape and murder. In 1969 David Milgaard, like many teenagers of the era, was a free spirit, experimenting with soft drugs and free love. UNfortunately, his youthful rovings put him in the wrong spot at the wrong time, and his name became inextricably linked, it seemed, to a grisly crime. Joyce Milgaard never doubted her son was innocent. But it took her 28 years to convince the Canadian justice system it had made a tragic mistake. Hhmm, that was the (synopsis) of the really nice story. Hehe. Currently still reading John Grisham's Street Lawyer. Very confusing and boring lar that one. I'm not even a quarter thru after 2 months of reading.   Aiyak, baru teringat! Gotta go reply my snail-mail. My friend's gonna kill me for not replying her earlier. Ah, see. Another bad habit. Procrastination (didn't know the word was this long) =) Off I go *poof* (disappears)

      Every single thing that I've dreamed about in life has never come to past. I realise that I'm a lousy decision-maker, that's why I hate making them. I just feel like crying and beating myself up. I blame myself for every decision I make cause I know somehow, I'll regret. Sometimes I wished I was never born. Life would be simpler that way. Well, I wouldn't be alive to know that anyway. But, things are what they are now. Couldn't do anything much about it though.   I've wondered many times about how it would be like when I die. I tend to bother a lot about my death. How would my funeral be like? How many and who would turn up? Who would be crying and who wouldn't bother about me at all? I wouldn't wanna doubt whether I'd be in heaven or not. But I believe I would be. And I definitely couldn't wait for that day to come.   I have more than a million questions running thru my head at this point. Eunice would know what about because we've done these kinda mind boggling chats many times at night. The more we ask, the more questions we would get, yet, without an answer. Guess we'll just ask God all about them when we get to heaven=)   I feel really low now. Depressed and probably about to have an emotional breakdown. I feel confused and not focused about anything at all. Where am I heading in life? That, I do not know. I wanna jump off a building and let this all end. Easy way out, I suppose. I know it's wrong but I feel this ever so often and all I want to do is just that. Can never explain what's going thru my mind now.    O God, forgive me for all my doubts and wrong doings. Lead me in whatever I should do and wherever I should go.

      Haha. IN the com lab again today. Hmmm. Still very sleepy lar. Didn't get to sleep a full 8hrs or so, for so many days de!!! Sighh. I think my eyes are gonna 'POP' out. My left eye's starting to swell a bit. As usual. Hmmm. Nothing interesting again today. Hehe. Just the usual lectures and all. Sighhh. Haha. My Calculus' teacher's hair memang funny lar. Long, long..thick, thick..curly wurly. HAhaha. Like a horse only. Seriously! His hair's longer than mine. But he hides 'it' when he teaches in class. UCSI has a lot of weird lecturers. Weirdness. Wuahahahaha =)  Yesterday, went to Vid Malley, again! Okay, okay.. It's actually our ritual *sshhh* to go there every Tuesday once I start studying in UCSI. Been there for who-knows-what fun! Haha. Kidding lar. I don't even know why I went there for... Aahhh! Yahhh.. Just remembered. Went to Vid Malley cause me mom wants to buy cloths from Kamdar. But in the end, I think she bought none! Hehe. Then, we walked there for quite some time till we got all thirsty and our feet got tired. Hehe.  Then at night there was this concert in FGA, KL. The band who played at the opening was the Heartbeat band (HOney mAn?). Raymond played the bass. Chunted lar the way his fingers run on the bass. Haha. But me had been admiring his bass playing since the first time I heard him play it in church. Kengness. Hehe. We went off early and I was extremely tired so slept a bit in Grace's car. A bit, because of her FAQ (frequently asking questions) session. She asks all those nonsense only lar. =)   Aiyah, today I can't focus on what I'm typing or what I wanna type here. That why it's all like in a mess. But no worries, all are craps. So, don't bother reading them. Wait, wait... Didn't I just finish crapping then only tell you to not read? Bummer. Should have told you before I went all the way. Hahaha. OKie lar. I think I sleepy de.   =0) Yeayy! Later can go back to play PS again! Wuahahaha.

      Hehe. Haven't been in here for quite a while. Hhhmm, what to say today leh? *thinking......... thinking*  Well, went to early morning lectures feeling really, really sleepy (as usual). Was yawning in class for like every minute or so cause I had not enough sleep the night before. HAha. Now having dark circles around my eyes and I'm still not wanting to go to sleep. Terrible leh. Hehe.   We went to Klang today, yes, AGAIN! HAha. Been there every week since I started studying in UCSI (pronounced as ook-see. Lol). Mum's making Aunt Kat's wedding gown and she has to go there to let her try it on. It looks really nice but the whole gown isn't ready yet. HAha. Wait till you see the finished one! Haha. Ish, I really wanna go to Perth for Aunt Kat's wedding! I really do. Why ain't I rich? Or at least have enough money to buy air tickets? Sighhh. Frustration, frustration. Me now having crazy plans for studies, which I know WOULD most probably NOT come true. Sigh, sigh, double sigh.  *psst, I still hate UCSI*  HHmmm, wanted to write a blog yesterday actually but hadn't had the time. HEhe. Well, yesterday (Sunday) our church had a speaker from Brisbane, Australia. He (Pastor Paul) is awfully TALL. He's like about 6'5", dad says. And kebetulan pulak, our interpreter was Aunty Tan, the short one (about 4'+ only). Aunty Tan's like up till his armpit only. So, our meeting was kinda hillarious and also kinda annoying. Annoying because she kept interpreting wrongly. She got the whole meaning and point of message all jumbled up. Aiyo. Where can like that wan? Guess it was his slang. GOsh, it must be it lar! But then, Pastor Paul was actually kinda cute. And he's only 22. Young and cute! No wonder my youth were paying rather much attention to his sermon ler. Hebat or not? Hehe =) But he was a bit of a jakun lar. He has never been to Msia and he was asking a lot of weird questions. HAHA. AND the way he uses the chopsticks..??? WUAHAHAHAHhahahahhahaa.. Funny lar. Just like me uncle-to-be, JAy. SeBIJI macam dia! HEhe. Aiyo, can never forget these moments ler =P  -Love isn't a feeling. Love is a decision-

       Wuahahahahaha. I've extremely gone mad! Hahahaha. Just finished doing my Computing Studies' Assignment in college and my butt's aching right now. HEhahahaha. Aiyo, I've been sitting on this very same chair without standing up at all for goodness knows how long?! I couldn't feel my feet either. Gosh, I wonder if I'll be able to stand up without collapsing later, uh? Hhmm...BUt, at last I've done AN assignment  ON TIME!  Yeps, I'm on time!! Can you believe it? One thing's for sure is that I know I, myself can't. It's weird finishing stuff on time, you know? Well, at least it does feel that way for me. Hehe. Sickness aye?    P/S: And to Eunice, I'm truly, truly sorry for pulling you in with me when I did my assignments. I am awefully grateful to you for HELPING me out, too.    &nbsp;  Hahahahaha. I feel so free at the moment. Don't know what to do right now up till 2.30pm. Maybe I'll just continue to sit here till my arms go numb, too? Hahaha. Took time off just now, browsing thru some webbies. I noticed how from a nobody you become a somebody and that now you're EVERYBODY's friend?&nbsp;It's somehow annoying when people starts sucking-up to getting-famous kinda peeps and 'announcing' to the www(whole wide world)&nbsp;that you and that famous someone are great friends.&nbsp;How pathetic is that? This&nbsp;got me thinking. Do&nbsp;those famous people actually get more&nbsp;annoyed by them than I do or do they&nbsp;just love the limelight? Do they&nbsp;FEEL anything? Anything at all? And I know, I've asked a&nbsp;LOT of questions&nbsp;already&nbsp;right up to this moment. HEhe.Well, just some random thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  P-U. Something's not smelling quite right now. The smell of stinking socks fill the air. I think it's the guy on my right. Or maybe the guy behind.&nbsp;Hhmm, I wonder if he could see this. *HELLO! ARE YOU LOOKING HERE?* Uhmm, NO reply. Guess he's busy browsing thru Friendster. Haha.     &nbsp;  Ehh....my hair looks really strange now. It looks horrible and the colour cacat lah. Why is my hair coulour like that wan ar? Hhmm...Maybe I sat down too long de. Wuahahahahaha. I guess I'll end here for now lar. I'm beginning to crap, crap, crap de. Hehe.

      -Bah Kut Teh. Yups, went to Klang today to eat the oh-most-delicious bah kut teh. Gosh, the smooth and intriguing flavor of Klang bah kut teh - is just heavenly! Even though bah kut teh could hardly be associated with heaven - at least it doesn't to me. Hehe.  My family and I went to Klang cause me mom wanted to let Aunty Kat try her wedding night gown to see if it fits. Guess a few more alterations and it'll be done! Hehe. Aunty Kat just received her VISA & her documents and she'll be flying off to Australia this Saturday. Man, this is fast. It's been approximately 7 months that Aunty Kat has been in Malaysia, waiting to renew her VISA and to get the green-light to marry an Aussie(Uncle Jay).  I'm gonna  MISS  her  LOADS  !!! Boo hoo hoo*sniff sniff*  Am extremely happy for her, though, cause she's finally settled everything and she'll be able to marry soon! Hhmm, I wonder if I'll be able to go to her wedding. Hhmmm....  Sidney (my cousin's doggie) is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo superly duperly megaly hyperly CUTE! Awww. I just feel like squeezing him (YEah, it's a HIM). He's a silky terrier and his fur's really, really silky. Hehe. He's getting bigger and bigger everytime I see him yet his cuteness is still there. But, he isn't that BIG at all. He has these humongous pair of blackish brown eyes and a golden, light brown fringe covering it slighly, making him look purely innocent (when he's actually not!) and just so irresistably adorable. He used to do a skid-backwards thingy when he was smaller-so hug-able lar. And when he trots around like a pony... aaahhhh! He's just so so so very cute. Eugene (the cousin) is equally as cute, but also very cheeky/mischevious/cunning. When I just stepped into his house today, Sidney came running and jumping at me. Then, this naughty lil boy carried Sidney around, chasing me. I ran, not because I was afraid of Sidney, but because I didn't wanna smell like him. Got class later mah. Haha. Eugene continued to chase me, so I quickly sat down on the sofa thinking he'd stop chasing me. But NO. He put Sidney right on top of me! Could feel Sid's tongue licking my arm and his paws touching my head. And it was all Gene's fault! Hmmph.  Took my examination token today and guess what? I was barred from taking my Accounting Practice finals paper due to poor attendence. Hehe. Not much commosion to be made because I intended to drop that subject and had never attended the class once. But it was weird and awkward at that time cause all the staff, who were doing their work quietly in the office, were staring at me one kind. Oh, and no other students were there, too, cause it was already past office hours. Hehe. It's just spooky 8)  Malaysian Idol -  Andrew made it through to the TOP 12(?) already. Congrats to him! Hehe.  "Fly me up to where you are beyond the distant star. I wish upon tonight...Oh malunya hati ini, bila kuingat saat itu. Kami hanya saling berpandang. Biar bla bla bla bla bla. I close my eyes, and dream of you and I and then I realise",  is the whole phrase I've got stuck into my system for these past few days. Just can't get it OUT! Sheesh. Bengang betul. =)  "I love mankind, it's people I hate."   Anyways, Eunice dear will be moving in tomorrow. And I just can't wait! Hehehe.

      Hhmm, I feel guilty blogging at this time. I've still got my Malaysian Studies' assignment to do&nbsp;which will be due tomorrow. And my Bio group member just told me to do handwrite the lab report which is due next week! Sigh. Distractions, distraction, distractions. If only the world would be less attractive. Gosh, what am I saying. I gotta rebuke this! Hehe.  Well, Andrew's gone for a week for the Malaysian Idol thingy. Will be seeing him  SING  on TV this time! Haha. We're rooting for him all the way! =) Had never imagine him being in a competition like this. So, I guess this is something interesting. Hehehe.   *Can you see me? Can you see me?... Gees, I guess you can't eh?*  Arrggghh! I get so annoyed at the fact that I'm somewhat invisible.   YOU can't see me?&nbsp;I was never&nbsp;there?   Puh-leazeeeeee lar. I'm so HUGE what. Why can't you see me? Do you actually see   right thru   me???  Oh my gosh! My bushy-haired lecturer actually could not see me. Handed up my Calculus test paper to him and he flipped through it! Oh boy, my most feared incident just happened! I know I didn't do well in my Calculus paper because I didn't really study. So, I was definitely in shock. He commented about my name, stating the phrase, "Nice  spelling " .&nbsp;  I was like, " spelling ??". Who compliments a name with that phrase? I.... I seriously dunno what to say. Well, I obviously just smiled. And then, he&nbsp;asked the "you're-invisible-phrase". Furiated, I never uttered a word to him but just nodded with whatever he asked. This is just like having icy cold water splashed on your face- hhmm, I don't think it goes with my story but the heck, it seemed that way to me.   Went out last night to Kajang to eat... yeah! SATAY. Hehe. If Kajang reminds you of Shanti&nbsp;then satay would remind you of... of... S..S..S-Samisi!! Haha =) Feasting the meat-on-sticks the whole night definitely reminded me of Samisi. Haha. Missing him right now. And Gosh! When will we get to see him again? I wonder. Yeah, you've guessed it. We did talk about them the whole time. Hehe. Hhmm, satay was fine, I guess. Hehe. By the way, that was my first time I've been to Kajang. So, someplace new eh?   Hehe.  &nbsp;

      I got up at 3.20 today. (Gosh! That late uh?) Well, wouldn't have got up at that time either if my friend didn't call. Ish! Called me asking something about satay-satay and all but I didn't really get it. (???)  At first I got up thinking that I missed class again today and felt really, really weird about everything. But I came to my senses soon enough to know that it was only a Thursday and later to realise that I don't have classes on Thursdays. Haha. Then, kept asking myself over and over again whether I got classes or not, to make sure that I really AM NOT late for classes. Traumatised de. Hehe=)  Why did I get up this late today? Well, the answer is pretty simple. I slept late last night, or rather, this morning. Only went to my bed at 5am. Why, again? Haha. My addiction to FFVIII would fit the answer perfectly. YUps, I'm back on track with continuing the Final Fantasy I left off. It amazes me how these things could get to you. But seriously, it's fun playing them.  Did nothing in particular after I woke up. Ate my 'breakfast' and played FF again! Yes, I play none other than that now. And this time my 'character friends' there held me a concert. There was this time when I had to choose different instruments for each character to play and they played it funnily lar. I chose wrong instruments for each wrongly at first, so I played that scene again and this time I got it right. HAha. CHun!  Went to dinner with Grace at 8pm at Gafan(at last). After that, Grace wanted to go to the orphanage somewhere in Cheras to do some charity. Weird. I've never seen her this enthusiastic about stuff like that. So, we spent quite sometime just to look for the orphanage. We found it eventually and went down to have a talk with the caretaker of the home. Grace wanted to ask her what they needed in the home and (whoa!) there was a long list! The kids were all indians so I guessed it was a indians' orphanage. Haha. And you know what? The kids called us 'uncle' and 'aunty'. I thought I heard wrongly. But then they kept repeating their phrase like, "Hello aunty!" and "Thank you aunty". Gees. So I seem old de.   Went to McD's after the visitation. Grace wanted to eat fries with ice-cream. So, we ate that lar. Hahaha. Anyways, came home about 11pm and I smell like smoke. Hehe.   Better get going anyways. I gotta get up eaaaaaaarly tmr. Aloha!

      Well, I haven't had the mood or rather the inspiration to write anything in this blog for a while. I still seriously don't know what to say here. HEhe. Hhmm.  Oh! Ah, I've been trying to upload pictures here in this blog but somehow, I don't know exactly how to work it. Better go back and experiment again. Been doing that the past few days though. But none came to a conclusion. Ish! How lar?  I know I wanted to say something here. But I can't remember what about now lar. Sigh. These days my memory has gone down the drain lar. I don't think there's anything in my 'RAM'or 'ROM'. Dumb dumb betul.  ..... ..... .....  So, guess there's nothing much for me to say! Haha=)

       D D D D Spiderman, Spiderman. Does whatever a spider can.         Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves just like flies.   Hehe. Went to watch yet another movie with Eunice last Wednesday. But this time we went to GSC Cheras Leisure Mall to watch Spidey2. Wuahahaha. That show was extremely hillarious lar wey! So funny that Eunice and I laughed so badly till we wanted to go to the toilet(good thing the guy beside me wasn't furious). Well, actualy we wanted to go to the toilet already lar, I mean before we laughed like mad. The train scene... WUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA *rotfl* That was super duper mega hyper funny lar! Overall, it was okie lar. Just the typical superhero kinda show where the Hero saves the damsel-in-distress who screams one kind. You know, the high pitched, long, wailing scream. Haha. Had guessed the bits and pieces of the show thanks to the many sneak previews they've shown on TV since last year(perhaps last, last year?). And Tobey Maguire looks rather silly in that Spidey costume WITHOUT the mask. So... eyer *goosebumps*  Had nothing else better to do so we(my family & Eun) went to a weird fashion show of some sort yesterday in TOPSHOP MV. There were pretty, yet funny models. I mean each of them has their signature walk and some of them looks like people I know! Haha. SpOoky. Check this out - One of 'em stomps when she walks, one walks like she's in a hurry, one looks like Eunice's "brother", another is super thin, one really looks like someone I know(who? WHO?) and the rest are okie lar. Haha. And Eunice admires one of the models' long, shiny hair(the tallest one). =)

      Haha. My dearest koko woke me up early yesterday morning to watch the finals of the EURO2004 between Portugal and Greece. And much to everyone's disbelief, Greece took home the Cup. Who would have expected Greece(the underdogs) to outplay Portugal, who was obviously the 'better team' in the finals? It was a great match but I still thought the match, England vs. Portugal, was more exciting and it definitely seemed more like the FINALE of the Euro compared to the actual one. My koko thought so, too. I was torn between two teams as I didn't exactly know which country I was to support. HAha.(Actually I didn't really bothered supporting any of them till it was down to the 2nd half). I had to cheer for Portugal because they were the losing team and their face had the 'kesian' look, then. Pity them, they should have won. Either way, I was glad Greece won the title since they've done a great deal in winning it. After all, I am partially Greek, ain't I? Haha. Well, there's nothing 'Greek' about me- only my name! Lol. So, yeah.. go GreekS! But seriously, they have defeated all those stronger teams to reach to the top, which was their first time in a major championship. As fas as I know, they have never even gotten to the quarter-finals! Astonishing aye? Hehe. All hail Greece!   Now, I feel a sudden emptiness. Without any Euro to watch, I might be bored out of my wits. Gees.  I MISS the EUROs!  Hhmm, might as well just start a new hobby by watching the EPL. Hehehe..

      Ughh..I'm greatly disgusted at the format of the Malaysian Idol. Watching the Idols doesn't seem THAT fun to me anymore. Hhmphh! Guess they 'd better do something extravagant to grab my attention cause I've seemed to lost my interest in watching it. Didn't feel like watching today's episode, and found myself watching 'Moolah Beach' and 'Iron Chef' which was way better. (I mean- come on lar! 'Iron Chef' rather than Malaysian Idol?I've gotta be kidding myself). NOT REALLY looking forward to the next episode of the Idols- although I must say, Andrew makes the show funny! HAha. Andrew and Jien are, nevertheless, the reasons I tune in to 8tv on Fridays at 9.45pm. Tee-hee=)  Was actually really hyped up before the Idols' season began when I found out that a few of my friends from Klang were trying out. They didn't make the cut though. Andrew, a friend whom I've never thought I'd be seeing in the Malaysian Idol, however, DID! And during most of the auditions, he sang Josh Groban's. I suspect the judges like Josh - er, I mean his songs. They would somehow praise the one singing his songs and give that person good comments. Pickies!  Well, like the title, I really need to say how saddening Malaysian Idol is on air. They should have followed the American Idol's format instead but NO, they didn't want to! In fact the Malaysian Idol is kinda boring for an Idol fanatic(some sort) like me. Sheesh! Despite being a smaller country, it doesn’t mean that the format should be made ‘smaller’, too. (If you don’t get it, try watching American Idol’s auditions’ and workshops’ screening then watch Malaysian Idol and you’ll get what I mean.) Perhaps 8tv’s saving up on cost? What's a Wildcard show when the public gets to vote for their favourites  AGAIN ? It'll just be like 'another group', just that they've performed before and it's kinda like a second chance. (For Fariz, I guess it's the third!). The Wildcard should be up to the judges. Judges ARE supposedly better at judging but for this line of judges...*shakes head sadly*. Some of those who made it to the Top 11 don't deserve to be there at all. (Sorry for being offensive but it's the truth!). The voting system is beyond doubt unfair, I must say cause people just vote for who they like. NOT those who are capable to compete against the likes of Fantasia Barrino. By the way, viewers and voters are a majority of GIRLS. That's why most of the GUYS form each workshop made it through to the finals.  Judges? Haha. See for yourselves then judge. For me, I'm kinda irritated with them for not having the capability of judging PROPERLY. They're merely immitators of Randy, Paula and Simon. I've noticed that Paul copies the phrases of Simon all the time! Simon CAN judge in the American Idol and I believe in his judgings whereas for Paul...he just utters wrong phrases at the wrong times. Wanna imitate also, imitate properly lar. Geez. Better not judge them.... wait... I just did! Haha.  The American Idol has the 'IT-factor' in each episode which makes you exhilirated and wanting for more. As each episodes go by, you'll get more attached to the show. Unlike the Malaysian Idol which gets 'boring-er' and 'boring-er' in their eps. *yawns* Who are we to blame? The American Idol crew are professionals.  Gosh! I can't explain how much more bothered I am with all these. There are too many 'wrong' stuff, formats, whatever you call it, if I were to name it. Sounded offensive?....I'm cruel! Bwahahahaha!  c/8)

      The past weekend has definitely been a tremendously emotional one. Sent Aunt Kat off to Perth early Saturday morning and I miss her so much already. She gave me a prezzie before she left and it was a super duper cute, fluffy pen thingy(don't know what you call that). Hehe. She bought it from an ostrich farm during her visit in JB. And it's so adorable lar! =)  Watched 'A Walk to Remember' on last Saturday night and it was a great, touching show indeed. I got really emotional after that and I tell you again that the show was awesomely superb! Am kinda craving to buy the book or either some of the Switchfoot's albums. Hmm, I wonder. The song 'Only Hope' was nice. Got it stuck to my head all weekend long. Hehe. This is the lyrics -  Switchfoot version.     Only Hope    There's a song that's inside of my soul   It's the one that I've tried to write   over and over again   I'm awake and in the infinite cold   But You sing to me over and over and over again      So I lay my head back down   And I lift my hands   And pray to be only Yours   I pray to be only Yours   I know now You're my only hope      Sing to me of the song of the stars   Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing   and laughing again   When it feels like my dreams are so far   Sing to me of the plans that You have   for me over again      I give You my apathy   I'm giving You all of me   I want Your symphony   Singing in all that I am   At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back   =)
