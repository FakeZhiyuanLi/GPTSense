      THURSDAY~! woke in in a very sad n down mood.Didn't slept well last nite.twist n turn the whole nite.well,as usual ler,went to coll in the morning till after noon for class.The class 2day seemed to be SUPERBLY boring 2day,or mayb i'm not or should i say can't focus on anythin at all except for Jas.After my lunch,i went home just to give jasmine a call.talked to her for a while,then went out again with pin jack they all coz i'm relying on his transport,so it's like,i gotta follow his time.went to prangin with him for a drink.then left for the airport at 5pm.I was so so so sad n felt like cryin during the journey to the airport to send Jasmine off.Reached there at 5.45pm.Talked to dad a bit first,then after tht,me n Jas sat sumwhere else to chit chat a bit and passed her the long note tht i've wrote for her.asked her to read it after she board the plane.The feeling I had at that time was so so painful,so hurtful....so sad.but i tried to put on a fake smile in order to keep her smiling.but deep down inside,my heart is like being stabbed badly n the blood is pouring out like a river.Then she said she was hungry,so had dinner with her at nando's.this will be the last dinner i'll have with her.My tears was about to roll down my cheecks,but i tried to hold it back n pretend nothing was wrong n pretended to smile.Got her a cup of hot tea as she was having cough n was still under medication.Was really worried about her health n all that.Sigh,then after that,her friends arrived,so ok ler,i walked away to give them some time to spend with each other a while for the last time.I didn't know that she was waiting for me to go back to find her coz i told her i wanna go get some stuff but actually i was tryin to give her friends some time to spend with her,then she went around the airport to look for me.i was talkin to her dad though.Chit chatted with jas n her dad.took some really pictures with her.Soon,it was 7.30pm,time for her to board the plane.That was the saddest,worst,awful,terrible,horrible moment in my entire life,to bid her goodbye n to hug her so tightly knowing tht she'll be leaving u.My heart hurt so badly to see her walk into the departure area n soon was out of sight.I really feel like crying man.My tears were already covering my eyes,but i just kept on tryin to hold back.I tried really hard not to cry.It hurts alot ;(((  Now tht she's gone for more than 2 hours,she's even out of malaysian d, i'm beginning to feel her absence.It's like,some part of my life is missing. Jasmine,just want u to know that i miss u very very much n i love u deeply although from the surface,i might be acting as if there's nothing.but deep down inside,i love u deeply n miss u very much.My tears are actually flowing down non stop right now while writing this blog.it's flowing more n more drasticly. Man,it's so painful.i really cannot take the pain man.Huhhhh.......i think that's all for 2day ler,i'm really tired.so so tired.not those sleepy tired but those painful tiredness.take care peeps...chaoz~!
