      Okay, its 3:13 p.m. and my cute assets are still resting in this rolling executive chair. Why? Because the authorities have not delegated the appointed time to free the negroes. As Djimon Hounsou said in Amistad, "Give us Free." I'm 'bout ret to go.  In case you're wondering, I blew smoke up your terd tube on yesterday. What did I do last night? I watched the game and let the Claritin work. Ironically, it takes a crap load of alcohol to get me slizzard but Nyquil, Claritin and the over the counters send me straight to peter pan land. At least, I slept well. I have a busy weekend so technically, I can take into account all of the things I said in my previous entry.  Tonight is all about my date with Rip and the Beautimus (A beauty must)! In lay men's terms, its time for a touch up and a fill in. Who said just because you are keen on self-realization that you had to run around town au natural, looking like badu on crack? I must keep myself presentable. Anyhoot, I recently found out I am in two weddings that will happen before the end of the summer. Coupled with this road to higher ed in August, somebody is going to catch a whif of Chevon (my alter ego- please refer to Women's Wednesday.) So I'll be spending time at David's Bridal with undeserving brides and giddy saleswomen on Saturday morning and then I'm headed to a gospel concert in the park, provided it doesn't rain. If I went in the rain, Beautymus would have been to no avail. Saturday night, I have a date with the Lakers. Sunday is reserved for the ultimate Dude. From Sunday afternoon til the end of Memorial, I'm doing my best to obtain Slave Freedom, the kind of freedom that you will endure sleeping next to vermine and cold, dark nights led by Grandma Moses to get. The added bonus...I get to spend some quality time with my heart. Peace.

      My desktop at work, while craving for attention and quality time from me, fell ill on Tuesday. Yesterday, when I walked in my office, mouth still watering and full of the mcgriddle I sacrificed being late for work for, I was greeted by a brand new laptop. I had to learn the new system as my old machine hovered in the corner in despair. The only attention I could give it was to transplant the info on it to CD, only to transfer that info to the new and improved system. Then I realized, DEE-DAH!, its time for some upgrades in my life.  I've grown comfortable with the mundane and uninteresting, the lifeless and the usual. What happened to my thirst for the spontaneous and eclectic. I've developed into a home body who rarely sees daylight outside from work and church. I can sense the new beginnings in my life. All I have to do is sit in the passenger's seat and let the ultimate Dude drive. Upgrades in the physical are fine but I also want the subsequent mental, emotional and spiritual upgrades. My product has been discontinued. Its obviously unfit to perform any longer unless it gets repaired and soon.   With that being said, I'm going to Automatic Slim's for Reggae Night at 10 p.m. (After the game of course.) Peace...

      My freshman year I entered my info on the cheesy site www.classmates.com. (Don't act like you didn't.) Well, you never really think someone will take the time to email you through that thing unless a reunion is approaching. The other day I received an email from the site stating I had a new message from a classmate. Of course, I'm like "I'll be (expletive), who in the hell is this?" I click on the link and its from this random dude I went to Bellevue Junior High with. (B-O-Bob-Bobcats...Bellevue (stomp, stomp) Bobcats!) My bad, I had an orange and blue ghetto pom pon girl moment. Anyhoot, this guy sends me this message and it begins with the normal greetings and cat-o-nine tails, but what got me to get all sensitive and girly was that he mentioned he was bored...in IRAQ. Aw, hell naw...(A-tee-hee and tears ala the Tin Man, Nipsy Russell, in the Urban Film Classic "The Wiz"). Nevertheless, I felt compelled to send him a message back. I told him I'd be praying for his safe return. So here it is...a subject I thought I could ignore without getting too political and garnering some true anti-mybloggers.   I adamantly dislike President Bush. (I hear the echo of the deafening roar of approval from the black folks at the back of the bus and the leftists. Thanks.)  First of all, I do not dislike him because he is a republican. I am not a partisan voter. I vote for the best man. I just look like a Democrat. I dislike him because he has made life for me and those like me, a living hell. I am treking to grad school due to the lack of a sufficient economic growth which inherently determines the employment or rather unemployment market. I hate when people tell unnecessary lies. Example: When your "elected" leader tells you we are at war due to the suspicion of weapons of mass destruction when he really just wants to capture the dictator that put a hit out on his father. There's a smidgen of honor in that actually. I know if someone attempted to destroy Stephen B. Hines, all of the South Memphis/ Third World would rise out of me. So Bush honestly, has gotten his part of the deal but what have we gotten. Absoluetely nothing. All we get for Christmas is the remains of a loved one or a message like the one that appeared in my inbox today. I know that war is the inevitable. But I wonder is there an alternative. Maybe we should draft the criminals and felons on death row to stand on enemy lines? He'd probably go for that since 90% of them are black men due to our (expletive) criminal justice system. I don't even read the headlines regarding the war anymore because I'm too busy at the gas station filling up my tank with $2 a gallon gas. What surprises me most is that he hasn't been assasinated yet. (Please welcome my newest blog readers-the CIA, FBI and the Secret Service.) I am totally against violence and I would hate for him to be assasinated because (1) I am a Christian and (2) our alternative (VP Cheney) is highly unreliable. I'm just tired of people dying and America's blood and tears saturating the soil. Its not completely Bush's fault though, we all know who the real enemy is...Peace.

      Just surface conversation today. I've had enough of trying to "permeate the epidermis"...  First off, I concur the obvious from last night's festivities. Rip Hamilton is the unequivocal s*&$! It was a good defensive game which seemingly would have made it boring but this is the playoffs. Of course, the highlight of the game was T. Prince's block. You would think with over a decade in the league Reggie Miller would anticipate the obvious and take no easy lay-up for granted. Maybe that's why he still doesn't have a championship. Wow, that was a mean of me. I'm simply just not a Reggie Miller fan and once again, I love me some Rip Hamilton. As Sportcenter's black dude said last night after the game, Rip has ol' skool game.  Secondly, let me get all sensitive and give props to UPN for two excellent season finales of Eve and Girlfriends. My fingers are numb from flipping back and forward from the game to Toni flipping out over her Napoleonic MD husband. By the ways, hate to kill your buzz ladies, but that heifer ain't pregnant. She was drinking champagne with the rest of them while celebrating Mya's book deal. Either she's not with child or her mulatto baby will have six toes. Regardless, I was thoroughly entertained by the TV last night which is rare in this day and age. That's all I have for today. My work computer is having issues so I can't be a slacker. That sucks. Peace...

      In August, I will be leaving for graduate school at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, a place that I never thought I would return to. It was my second choice school because (1) I had been there, done that and who wants to back track? and (2) because I thought I wanted something different. I left my senior year of undergrad and transferred to Memphis because my life was in disarray. My mom was sick, I had barely escaped a car accident and drama hovered every nook and crany of UT. So to appease my mother and partly myself, I came home. It didn't take long to graduate because miraculously all of my credits transferred. Coincidence? No. I was reading the Bible the other day and I read a scripture about how God will transform you and bring you back to the place you left, to channel your growth. I am a totally different person than I was then and I welcome the opportunity now because I know that God is placing me there for a reason. It will be the first time I have lived alone and I will be the first to admit, I am intimidated by that fact. Lately, God has placed a number of things and people back in my life and it has made me appreciate their presence and re-evaluate their importance. I am savoring the experiences I am having now and the ones that I will be having in the future. I never realized how much I needed to 'backtrack' in order to progress forward and come full circle. Some things in your past are meant for you treasure and acknowledge its worth. My God is a God of second chances and the second chance is always better than the first. I'm going back to finish what I started, in hopes that I will leave these experiences with an even more evolved spirit. I never realized how much I missed people and places until after being reunited with them, you see just how beautiful and amazing they were. I am elated at the fact that I have learned that I am not truly the 'master of my fate, the captain of my soul'. Now I know how to let go and let God...He'll always bring me back to the middle for a purpose and this time, I will come full circle, exposed feelings and emotions in tow. I'll embrace the things he has given me the second chance to bring to fruition. I finally understand that closure does not always signify an ending but also a beginning. Peace.

      I love me some Rip Hamilton, not because he's attractive (just not my type) but because of his pure and unequivocal skill. I was asked by a friend a few years back who wanted to test my sports knowledge, who I thought the league and fans were sleeping on. The answer was not The Answer (A.I. for the net challenged) but Richard Hamilton, who then was fresh out of college. He had all the makings of what would seem to be a college superstar who would morph into a medicore additive to the league but there was one thing that leveled me about this kid. I saw the adamant hunger in his eyes as his listened to and watched "The Best" carefully. Why wouldn't you cash in on the opportunity for Jordan to tutor you? Unfortunately, folks are still sleeping on him because his supporting cast is not quite up to par. With all that said, I'm rooting for the Pistons, partially for Rip and partially because in the pit of my stomach, I think the Pistons can return to greatness. Greatness meaning when Isiah, Lambeer, Rodman, etc. where throwing bows before the phenomenon struck the ATL. The NBA has returned to finals that people will cling to the TV to watch like the last episode of Friends, except this cast has appearances by minorities and the unattractive at times. (No amount of money in the world would make me date Sam Cassell. Whew!) Whoever advances after winning the division titles, I'll be there. I love this game!

      No, this is not a blog entry about collabo between Luda and B. Streisand. This is about why today in Memphis is a true southun' day- fried Memphis style. God has set the thermometer on cruise control, steadily riding at a breezy 70 degrees. I had lunch at Joe's and sat on the patio by myself. It makes a statement when you can go out and eat alone, that either you're confident in yourself or you've just been released from 201 Poplar Ave. (Memphis Joke). Either way, I did not want to be bothered. I sat on the dock and listened to the quill of the Mighty Mississippi and it took me back, waaaaay back. Today was a day that reminded me of how my grandmother would send us outside in the front yard and cut fresh watermelon for us to eat. No utensils, just dripping juice and spitting seeds. Unaware that somehow she was perpetuating the myth of the "porch monkey" but who gave a damn. There just wasn't too many white folks rolling by in the heart of South Memphis' Third World. Then she'd pull out the sprinkler and let us run through it so we could have our own version of ghetto olympics. I seriously thought I was a Mary Lou Retton (sp?) clone. Today made me remember when waking up at 5 a.m. wasn't so difficult and Laurence Fishborne wasn't a seasoned actor. He was just the cowboy with the scary curl on Pee Wee's Playhouse. I remember when I didn't hate Memphis so much. I thought Beale Street, Memphis in May, the Memphis Zoo, the Pink Palace and the annual field trip to the Orpheum to see the Nutcracker at Christmas time was classic. Age hasn't taken so much out of me. I wish I was a kid again, when impressing others and them impressing me was only about who had every color and style of those cute jellies. (shoes) Those were the days. Southun' Fried and The Way We Were, just Authentically Memphis...  Top Ten Reasons Why I Love My Hometown...  10. Triple Six Mafia, Playa Fly, Gangsta Boo and Memphis Rap in general.  9. Mayor Herenton's willingness to rep' his hood at any occasion. He keeps it real.  8. A freeway that loops so you can never really get lost.  7. The Memphis Pharoahs, Showboats, Tigers, Redbirds and the Grizzlies.   6. Beale Street on a holiday weekend especially the Southern Heritage Classic. (Yes, its an authentic Memphis holiday.)  5. How a ten minute drive can take you from the worst neighborhood in Memphis to the best.  4. The cost of living.  3. Real Barbeque.  2. Getting out of work/ school for the smallest amount of snow or ice.  1. People that never change who make memories that last forever...

      It seems that the inhabitants of Blog Country have at least one thing in common. Most, if not all, have a consistent title and subject for a particular day of the week. I have decided to make Wednesday, Women's Wednesday, where I speak on issues specific to the female mind and spirit. I borrowed the title from a program that's done by the blue and white fraternal organization at the U of M but I'm sure they won't mind...  I speak of my quaint and unusual thought provoking theories of human observation quite often at work and among friends. I'll share one today. It is my theory that people have a different personality for every member of their complete name (first, middle, last). I've come to terms with who Stephanie and Chevon are. This is the norm for most people have a different side of themselves that is seldom seen and rarely evident. That's why I find it so important to know what your name means. I was first introduced to this in English Comp my freshman year at the Univ. of Tennessee. I was given the opportunity to disect my full given name and comment on how this name has been a blessing and/or curse. I never realized until after finishing this exercise that the name your parents give you can strongly affect your personality and how others perceive you. Stephanie (my main personality) means crowned. Chevon (my repressed personality) means God is gracious. These names, juxtaposed with my surname, Swanigan, made something clear and obvious to me. I immediately thought about the childhood stories about swans. Swans are known as gracious and ostentatious. Confidence and not conceit. I can relate. But on the less that positive side, I also thought about the story of the 'ugly duckling'. I've never considered myself unattractive but I was taunted quite a bit in grammar school because of my weight and awkwardness but in the end, I surpassed those same bullies and finger-pointing rug rats in every area of my life and as I grow older, I still encounter opposition. Because of my namesake, the period of 'weight (burden) and awkwardness' is ironic when I eventually excel beyond measure and transform into the swan that I have been named to be. The pain of the jeers and inadequate support makes it bittersweet. So do I have choice? Or has my name just cursed me to endure the bitter in order to enjoy the sweet? I think everyone should know what their name means and what it calls for them to do or not do, conquer or not conquer. Your name actually could commission you to greatness.   There's an addendum to my theory. I have also observed that those who have multiple middle names or various nicknames have personalities for those too. Unfortunately, it has come to my attention that the majority of people I know who fit into this category go from one personality to the next within seconds. In other words, they are crazy or just plain interesting to watch. If you've taken offense to this, I'm probably talking to you. This also applies to people who refer to themselves in the third person. Just think on it. You'll find it to be true. There are people who have a first name, two middle names, and two last names and a specific personality for each.   With all that said, I bet you're wondering how does this apply to women. I simply advise all women to be careful what you name your children. It may come back to haunt you. And if you're a man and want to know how this applies to you, it may explain why your crazy ex-girlfriend, "Lisa Nicole-Elizabeth Smithe" put sugar in your gas tank or slashed you tires. She just hasn't dropped a personality (name) or doesn't know how to repress it and get on with her life.  If you haven't noticed yet, I had nothing else to speak on except for one of my unusual theories. It's hump day. Go figure...

      I think it was Albert Einstein who said "great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds". Having said that, I do consider myself a great spirit so that leaves mediocrity, at its finest, eating away at my being and strongly in opposition of my upward mobility. My yesterday was a 80's Bangle's hit better known as a Manic Monday. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong and most of the people who I permitted to crawl under my skin were those subject to mediocrity. Aside from the fact that my hormones were on superload (that's neither here nor there and probably TMI for the male species), I encountered a mixture of psuedo-intellects and mediocre minds, which are two of my personality pet peeves. It happened at work where I worked overtime attempting to plan an imaginary business trip. It happened again at work when I overhead an executive make a joke about left wing politics and how inate it was. I took it personal because I knew that automatically meant, beacuse of the upcoming elections, John Kerry, which eventually breaks down as the Democratic Party which inherently includes a majority of minorities. Semantics is key here. If I wasn't at ear shot, I'm sure other words or slurs would have been used. It happened at lunch when I took a 'run for the border', trying to save time, but obviously this establishment forgot to include the customer service portion in the employee manual. But there was one thing I was actually looking forward to, the Motown 45 Special. (silence from the crowd) Needless to say, I was disappointed. Both of my parents are entertainers so I grew up anticipating the award shows and musical events for the sheer entertainment of seeing professional musicians work their melodic magic. Well, that didn't happen last night. True enough, those who performed could sing but I just wasn't entertained. I don't know...maybe I am just hard to please...Peace.

      I felt my biological clock tick for the first time on Saturday. There's nothing like attending a wedding. It will 99.9% of the time replace fresh and new batteries in the apparatus located in your womanly areas. There's nothing like reuniting with high school classmates who have suddenly and quite easily transformed from class clown/president/nobody to nurturing mother and/or wife. I had always imagined preparing myself for these mini-reunions, always seemingly more concerned with what level of intellect or power I had acheived. I was one of few that attended the nuptials from OHS who was degreed and pursuing further, but for some reason, I felt the most unsuccessful. After much thought, I asked myself again (for about the 50th time), how did I measure success? And I came to the conclusion that I measure success not by power, prestige or money but by happiness and by peace of mind. Unfortunately, I have been sucked into the funnel tube of autonomy and independence. I have become all too concerned with shattering the glass ceiling instead of building a foundation. Since childhood, I have wanted, more than anything, to be a good wife and mother and I still feel that way. I realize that I can succeed and endeavor to be both successful in the corporate world and in domesticity. But until now, I hadn't been able to create duality in pursuing both. I guess Saturday was my wake-up call. I'm taking my hand off Snooze. I'm not exactly sliding on my air max and dashing toward the finish line of matrimonial bliss. I've just become more aware of how important it is to me. Peace...

      This is a step outside of my box. An virtual exclamation to the cyber world that I have arrived. I'm not accustomed to sharing my innermost thoughts with complete strangers. (I have trust issues...acceptance and acknowledgement of your problem is the first step.) My mind harbors a unique stream of consciousness where I not only jump from one issue to the next but connect them in an inanimate way. My guess is that this is a cry to those who share this great gift, who feel their kindred voice goes unheard but are reluctant to share it with those whose auras, intellect, what have you, are not willing to accept randomness as pure comic relief. Sometimes I think people take me too seriously or maybe I take myself too seriously. That's a thought. Anyhoot, I am a neo to this world and excited to journal my craziness. Til next time..

      Best Performance: Kanye West's "Jesus Walks" featuring Yolanda Adams, with honorable mention to Usher Raymond's "Yeah" and "Burn."  Best Quote: "For the little girl backstage who didn't know...(cocaine sniff)...asked who the hell I was...I'm Rick James, Beeetch!"  Most Memorable Moment: Hip Hop 25 Years on Wax  I was thoroughly entertained. So admist the demour of urban music at its best, I wondered if Hollywood remade "The Wiz", who would play the main characters? The performances last night confirmed my cast. Dorothy could be played by Alicia Keys, Usher as the Scarecrow, Cedric the Entertainer as the Cowardly Lion, Wayne Brady as the Tin Man, Jill Scott as Glenda the Good Witch and Missy Elliot as Evilene. And of course, who else to play the Wiz, than Steve Harvey. As I write, I'm copywriting this joint so when it hits theatres, I'm hitting the bank.   In other news, I had the weirdest dream last night and after much consultation with my male harem, I am convinced that my dad's erratic behavior and silent treatment stems from the fact that he only thinks that I call him when I need something. I reiterate that I haven't asked him for anything since I graduated from undergrad and every conversation we've had since then eventually leads to money. So I am going to confront him about this and see if I get a response. Update: Its storming like crazy in New Orleans so I made an executive decision and cancelled the trip. I'm going to the ATL instead. Atlanta is never a disappointment. Peace up...A-town down...Ye-ah!

      My day thus far has had its fair share of ups and lows. After finally retrieving my parking card from the authorities, I lost it as soon as it fell into my hands. The powers that be had allowed me to park in the "special lot" without being towed yet this morning I had the eerie feeling that I should park on the side street and actively search for my card. By gosh, I found that mofo under my laptop. Soon afterwards, the company legal counsel calls and says his vehicle had been towed from said lot. So I survey that I can pick up a %50 comped lunch from the joint downstairs, move Cali (my car), all in the same swoop. But today, my girl wasn't working and the jealous less attractive heifers didn't give me my discount. Since can't nobody beat me being spiteful, I paid the $7.64 AND left a tip. Walked back up to the office and the damn coke machine is out of everything but diet coke. So I said, *bleep* it, I need to drink some H20 anyway. On my way back to the conference room to eat my sour cream saturated chicken nachos. (Addendum: Stephanie does not like sour cream but somehow it ended up on my food.) I mean, WTF! My phone rang at my desk so I decided to go ahead and answer. I pick up the phone and waste the remnants of this morning's OJ all over my desk. I had to have a Whitley Gilbert moment.   RELAX: I sat and tried to enjoy my chicken nachos and was surprised to find out sour cream ain't that bad.   RELATE: I talked to a couple of folks with some major issues going on, like baby mamas trying to kidnap newborns, unexpected exams and chest pains.  RELEASE: I will be in full effect watching tonight's BET Awards. Its like how the Soul Train Awards used to be. Its our Grammy's since the real thing is boring as hell. Got a few observations for you to pay attention while watching tonight's festivities:  1. Doesn't Usher look like those spies in the Mountain Dew Spy vs. Spy commercial? 2. Jay-Z, Ludacris and Eminem must go to the same personal trainer. They all have a case of the bad body. 3. Can anyone supply me with Lil Jon's high school yearbook picture?  I think the nigga is quite the closet intellectual and I wouldn't be surprised if he attended private school. 4. Since Bentley Farnsworth is always 'fly", I bet his bowel movements stink to all oblivion. Most folks who always look dapper, crap stank like hell. 5. Will P. Diddy throw up Orange Mound?  6. Is Mase fooling folks into thinking he's making a comeback and right when he does his premiere performance, he busts a sermon? 7. Can you imagine what Juve the Great's Slow Motion video would have looked like if it wasn't a tribute to Souldja Slim?  I'm out of here like burnt fried bologna with the bubble in the middle. Tomorrow, I'll comment on the Awards and recast a Film Noir classic. Peace.

      Its the bottom of the sixth. I need the rally monkey...NOW!  To the sports illiterate, you may be wondering wtf is a rally monkey. Well, being the future pro ball exec I am, let me give you a definite answer. (Don't feel bad, the rally monkey phenomena had to be explained to me by Dean Doctor. Thanks, honey bunny.) The legend of the Rally Monkey heralds as such:    "The legend of the Rally Monkey began June 6, 2000 as the Anaheim Angels were losing to the San Francisco Giants. Video crew members were pulling out all the stops in their attempt to whip up some crowd support.        They came across a video clip from the 1994 hit movie "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective," staring Jim Carrey, that showed a monkey jumping up and down. They superimposed the words "Rally Monkey" over it and flashed it on the JumboTron. The crowd roared.        The Angels rallied, scoring two runs in the last inning to win.        Before long, the Angels needed their own monkey and hired Katie, the white-face capuchin monkey featured on "Friends," to film a series of new Rally Monkey promos. Katie filmed a series of spots including the standard "Jump Around" clip that is now shown.  She also filmed the legendary "Believe in the Power of the Rally Monkey" clip.       Since then, the Rally Monkey has been superimposed in video clips from Hollywood hits such as  Star Wars, Jerry Maguire, Scream and many more." (wwww.rallymonkey.com)  *thinking: "Damned journalistic and literary vices, I still can't steal a quote without citing the author.  Nevertheless, the Giants (Bills, School, Work, Family, Friends, etc.) are tearing into me like a fat lady on a steak at Ryan's. I have always felt a kindred attachment to the Anaheim Angels because Anaheim sounds like my mom's name (Ann Hines) and consequently, the birther of the blogger affectionately calls me "angel". Hell, I'm still trying to earn my wings. I'm tired and fed up. When does a sister get some love? It feels like I am losing a winning battle. A heifer still hasn't copped those rubber wheels and has finally come to the realization that she has to get on that hustle. Still, I am on the fast track to being an autonomous vixen. And that's dangerous. Its more that just the missing P195 70R14s. Its more than the accruing of meaningless bills. (T-mobile is pimping me like Antonio Fargas aka Huggy Bear.)Its more than the influx of purchasing the "I now live by myself" necessities like a microwave, iron, bigger tv, etc. before I leave for grad school. I need some motivation. I need the freegin' rally monkey to rear his hairy curious george-esque head and inspire me to shatter a grand slam even if a Roger Clemens fast ball is heading toward me clocking 100.   But with all this being said, I'm headed to the bayou this weekend to point and laugh at inebriated boughetto house negros. I'll take pictures for you and somehow figure out a way to post them. Peace...

      "When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved; because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless who had none to help him." -Job 29:11-12  Don't shut down because it's a bible verse. If Kanye can talk about Jesus, I can too. By the way, the "Jesus Walks" video is indescribable. No words for it. It's almost cool to be a Christian now...I'll come back to this later.  People, I need a brand new set of tires within the next week. Moms is taking my car to get an oil change and a tune-up today and the being who determined my sex during conception is supposed to take care of the P10570R14 rubber wheels so I don't end up stranded in Podunk County. Can you sense my frustration? Well, let me give you some background. I usually refrain from indulging in literary nakedness and exposing personal bizness but this time is different.(Taking off BCBG sandals and resting horizontal on the shrink couch.) Here goes:  I love my dad...almost to the flip side Oedipus...almost as much as Beyonce is crazy in love with Matthew (oops, I mean Jay-Z). Dude has been there for pretty much everything I needed and wanted. I have really fond memories of my childhood. Saturdays were filled with museum visits, the movies, "dates" so I'd know what to expect and demand from a man, etc. I would run like Flo Jo when he rang the doorbell in the afternoon to pick me up from nana's. But as I got older, this nigga started evaporating. After high school, it would take like days for him to return my calls. I guess he felt like "damn, you grown now". Don't get me wrong. I made some choice mistakes that may have caused the apprehension. (example: moving in with boyfriend sophomore year, apparently suffering from grown-itis) But as of now, I'm on swole. I got it together. Graduated from college...check...Pay my bills...check...Starting graduate school...check. I rarely ask him for anything because, hell, I'm 24. Still, within the last year, he's done some uncharacteristic *expletive*. He didn't call me on my birthday and to top that, this past Sunday, I invited him to church and dinner afterwards and I received no phone call back. I mean WTF. Does he think Daddy duty has ended? How can you do that on Father's Day of all days? I'm trying to take him out and spend my money and he can't even return a phone call. So nevertheless, I was pissed to pisstivity, especially since he had promised to buy the new tires. I left a message again yesterday and since its impossible for me the fake the funk, attitude was all up in the vocal chords.   Last night, God told me he was "a friend to the fatherless". I had heard that before and always thought it meant those unfortunate and fortunate to have been raised by their moms only. I didn't think that would ever ring true in my life. So I'm asking God for the tires and maybe he'll use pops as an instrument or something or the other. I'm trippin'.  Who knew it would be cool to mention Jesus again? God has His own little way of creeping in unnoticed. I respect Kanye for the song and the video. Professional Christians always look down on people who curse, go to the club, etc. but everybody has something they need to work on. I obviously need to work on depending on man for my needs when I really need to depend on God.  I was angry with my dad but I'm getting over it. He has the url to this site so if he reads it, he'll get over that too. Peace...

      The office house negro, randomly known as the baby of the negro clique, has approximately 45 days left on the plantation before she heads down the underground railroad, with all signs pointing to Knoxville, Tennessee. You may say I'm heading in the direction of a far more racist and whip-tastic plantation but at least, the rednecks up there are up front and honest with their hatred for the 'cullured folk". If you're a racist, proclaim it like the poor fellow I encountered on the expressway this morning. He was driving non other than the official transportation choice of Southun' rednecks, an F150, complete with a couple of choice state university emblems with racial undertones, a Nascar logo, a rebel flag and a personalized license plate that read...NBKILLER. Of course, the obvious translation of this is nigger boy killer. Its the only logical answer. If you can think of another, please inform me. 'Preciate it.  Today is my makeshift monday. Why? Because I shot hooky from work yesterday. (Yep, me too Misty.) I was attacked by the allergies yesterday but I could have "played hurt", as the earthly ultimate dude motivates us to, but I didn't feel like getting out of bed or doing crap else for that matter. I deserve it. I'm here bright and early with the uncle tom overseer, working for massa. So who cares if I sat peddling the stationary bike on the sidelines, nursing my injury, apparently with the inability to "play hurt". I could say I learned that little gift well from the spawn of satan (former Stephanie addict who now plays professional ball). I just wasn't feeling it, especially now since Mr. Republican did not get the ax on Friday. It was a freegin' false alarm. F-u, pay me, earthly ultimate dude. He was supposed to be out of here like, I don't know...hell...burnt bologna with the bubble in the center.   Nevertheless, the corporate big wigs lack the effort and cajones to fire Mr. Republican. I don't know if its something engraved in Afro-genetics but when you tell a real nigga to fire someone, we relish it and perform that better than any other job description on the resume. They should have let me do it. Homeboy would have been suited and booted before he could say Rush Limbaugh.   So it looks like I'm leaving before he does and that majorly sucks. I was looking forward to my "What I did over the summer" essay on the first day of grad school and ending it by pissing off all of the department rednecks with my recount of how Mr. Republican got canned. My spirits are up though. I leave for New Orleans July 2, pleasantly excited to parlay in the bayou and eat some craw fish and shrimp, listen to the Essence Fest acts outside the Superdome (No, I ain't paying to see them up close) and drown in a silky glass of Chardonnay. I bought some cute secrets via Victoria but that'll unfortunately remain privileged and confidential. Dayum celibacy! (since January, I might add.) I'm going to heaven on a scholarship for that...peace!

      "Soap all over the sink, make you think, somebody been getting that booty spanked....Preciatory...That's the way we're gonna to tell this story." (Morning Matthews)  I think I have may have cracked the code. My uncertain influx of male friends have supplied me with confidential man secrets over the years. They let me observe the way they talked to women and interacted with them as if I was a resident intern. Within five minutes of meeting a guy, I can usually tell if he has a roaming eye, is prone to infidel behavior, has a girlfriend or committed lady in waiting, etc. Morning Matthews is a close friend of mine who will be joining the ranks of husbandry in less than two months. I've known him for about three years and needless to say, he was a ladies man before the bride-to-be and religious deliverance changed his ways. He and his roommate had their own intrinsic language. The above is a song they would sing throughout the day after they had conquered another poor victim at the apartment located on #1 The Place (literal address). They would swagger to the bathroom bucket naked or half clothed from consummation and sing the classic tune "Soap All Over the Sink". I witnessed it while having lunch at the apartment with Morning Matthews when the Roomie departed his love nest and preceded to the bathroom. I learned much from these guys as well as others. But I also have to ask myself, do I know too much?   Sometimes ignorance is bliss, they say, and I'm pretty well informed on the consorts of bachelorhood. But this also makes me overanalyze men in general. My ability to crack the code is a gift at best and I use it to aid my sometimes oblivious female counterparts. Consequently, I very rarely have the relationship issues that they have. Through my lifelong resident internship, I have learned to be the consumate girlfriend. Cooking...check....Trophy-Like Appearance...check...Lovable to Parents...check...Sports Literate...check...Beer Drinker...check...Lady in the Streets...check...The other half of that colloquialism...check...Self-Sufficiency...check...Damn, I'm good.   I owe it all to guys like J-Dubya, Walter, Morning Marcus and Roomie, Heartthrob, 'O' and of course, Dean Doctor. I'm on my way to graduating with an MRS Degree...Peace.

      'Round 11 p.m.ish, I was still awake last night and the channel flipper landed me on the BET planet called Midnight Love. I actually thought it was the night that they play the ol' school joints, hoping to see a brother in a wave nouveau, wearing a cross colors fit, singing "All I Do Is Think Of You (Day and Night)...I used to love that song...Ineeway, when the first video came on, my heart went thump and I couldn't even rememeber why. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Before I divulge what song and video could make me get whoosy for an uncontrollable reason, let me give you some background info.   Since birth, I have always equated music with being the soundtrack of my life. Like, I could pop a cd in full of songs that represent every detail of my life and you could write my biography without any parentheticals from me. I love music more than the average joe. I breathe that ish. Its one of the only things that can evoke emotion out of me. For example, I can be dried eyed and bushy tailed at the church on the hill early Sunday morning but as soon as the choir or a Mahalia Jackson re-incarnate busts an ol' negro spiritual or some slow repentant hymn, I am snotting all over the place. Ocassionally, this occurs with secular music as well, only not the the extent of tears. I have no shame in shedding tears for the Ultimate Dude...absolutely none. However, last night, BET just had to play that damn "Where I Wanna Be" video by Donell Jones and for a second, Miss Swanigan felt, remorse, sadness and lonely even. The light bulb appeared over my head and I recalled that an ex, to remain nameless, used that song to explain why he needed to sow his wild oats. I've been over dude for a good while now but isnt' it ironic how unconsciously your heart just automatically remembers how you felt way back when. Dammit, I am human, after all. Even funnier is that the same thing happens when I hear "End of the Road" by Boys II Men. That song goes back to the seventh grade when I had this huge crush on this guy named Eric. I was too afraid to tell him so he ended up with this unworthy girl. (Don't even remember her name.) Nevertheless, at the seventh grade dance, he and ol' girl slow danced right next to me to the tune of....you guessed it..."End of the Road". And I still get that one second memorialized tingle when I hear the first line..."we belong together." Thankfully, my best buddy til this day, JWD, felt my pain and danced with me. I LOVE YOU MAN!   By the same token, I have many, many sacred and lovely song memories, like me and Dean Doctor's "For All We Know" by Donny Hathaway. I cherish those more anyway. Peace...

      "Those who don't know speak, those who know, don't speak".   Don't ask the quote queen where she stole that little diddy from but it helps me center my thoughts for the day and what I wanted to share with the inhabitants of blog country.   After parlaying on a fabulous medley of chicken salad and saltines, courtesy of Schnuck's, 'round lunch time, my god-father popped the lastest office hush on me. Mr. Young Republican, the newest office "white boy", is getting the long awaited ax. The news is highly welcomed on my part and I am anticipating it almost as much as the BET Music Awards and sharing in Rip's emotions as he cuddles the championship trophy. (Ahem...I have to gain my composure. I vowed not to dedicate another entry to the Pistons.)  To put it simply, I don't like dude. I guess I'll have to start from the beginning. The party in question first appeared in our office during his interview process. He seemed likeable and friendly, unintrusive enough not to test the 'negro clique'. He was soon hired apparently due to the fact that he was the son of the former county mayor, who subsequently hob nobs with earthly ultimate dude also known as the boss. He was quite loudly loquacious, which was a key sign that we were going to run into some difficulties. His first few weeks were his attempt to conquer the "Office Favorite White Boy Award", consequently which is sponsored by none other than the 'negro clique'. I still watched him closely because I knew his ignorance would seep out after he tried on numerous occasions to show how "ethnically inclined" he was. You know, the usual 'I know black people' garbage like saying 'don't be scurred'. He flirted with the cute and single petite black girl who always laughed at his jokes and seemed intimidated by the suits because she rarely commented. (That's me, for the slow bunnies.) Soon the day came when the 'negro clique' decided to have an after office hours conference on random mumbo jumbo and experiences. He decided to join in. When five o'clock strikes, my demeanor changes. Not to say I'm fake at work. I just keep to myself so not to burn any bridges with the big wigs. Since I knew the origins of how he landed his gig(not much different from my route but that's neither here nor there), I decided to test him. Hell, I was bored and I like pissing ignorant people off. This was the first minute of the conversation:  Setting: the god-father's (who got me my gig) office 'round 5-ish. Two black women, one black dude and Mr. Young Republican are sitting around in conversation.  Me aka Black Woman #1: (pointing to the Bush 2004 pin on Mr. Young Republican's lapel) Why are you wearing that?  Mr. Young Republican: Why not?  Me aka Black Woman #1: Because he's the devil incarnate...  (The black dude and black woman #2 let out a slight giggle. They knew his demise.)  Mr. Young Republican: He is not the devil. Aw, your vote doesn't count anyway.  Aside: WHITE BOY HAS IT COMING AFTER TELLING A YOUNG BLACK WOMEN SOME BULLISH LIKE THAT! YA'LL KNOW THAT, RIGHT?  Me aka Black Woman #1: My vote doesn't count, huh? Well, first of all, I'll be voting for much longer than this (pointing to Mr. Young Republican but looking at 'negre clique') 40 year old and secondly, you can join Bush in hell after he doesn't get re-elected.  (The black dude and black woman #2 let out a slight louder giggle. They knew his demise. After a brief pause, Mr. Young Republican carries on a conversation with black dude and black woman #2 eventually leading to the discussion of reparations. Black Woman #1 hurts Mr. Young Republican's feelings again only after he explains why blacks don't deserve reparations, by informing Mr. Young Republican taht Abraham Lincoln did not free the slaves and that Mr. Young Republican should become more learned on the complete black experience before he speaks on such subjects. In addition, she ends the conversation by saying that she will always have the upper hand on him because, in school, his history books only told one story but she knows bothe his-stories. Mr. Young Republican's face crinkles and falls to the ground.)  I actually feel sorry for the guy. He has good intentions but the road to hell is paved with those. He just need to learn when to speak and to be spoken to. Which brings me back to the lovely quote that precedes this entry.  "Those who don't know speak, those who know, don't speak".   In other words, we should all learn when to just shut the hell up, which I will be doing now before the authorities get ahold of this and I'm kicked out of this peice two months early, sharing a slice of humble pie with Mr. Young Republican...Peace.

      For all of you who aren't history buffs like myself, the Federalist Papers were written under the pen name of Publius by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to gain support for the Constitution. With a degree in PR, it's the basis of how to run a good campaign...blah, blah, blah. After last night's festivities, I thought I'd have a SNL (Saturday Night Live Moment) and spoof it. Here goes:  Federalist Paper Number 32  The Same Subject Continued (Concerning the General Power of a Piston- Nation)  (source)   The Daily A-Whiiping, Thursday, June 10, 2004  (author)   Hamilton (you know which one)  To the People of the State of Lakerville:  ALTHOUGH, I am of opinion, I am also of fact. There is not need to prolong this. There is no need to whimper and complain or place the blame on the fans that kept you up before the game, honking and yelling expletives. I liken your demise to something that was told to me my freshman year regarding grades. Its so easy to make the first granduer GPA but you can fail the next semester and never see the upper echelon of excellence again. It'll take three years for you to even scathe what you first found so easy to acquire. Lakers, your respect is lost and can only be regained through kissing the ground that the Pistons walk on. Line up, my handsome gentlemen...get on all fours...the Palace of Auburn Hills awaits you.  The End   urlLink    Physical example for the Lakers  In other news, Mr. Genius + Soul= Jazz (Ray Charles) passed. I am anticipating even more his biopic starring Jamie Foxx.  And can someone tell me do Halle and J.Lo go to the same shrink. They are queens the the harem better known as "Attractive Women Who Can't Retain A Man."  I'm leaving work 'round 3-ish to walk across the street to the Peabody Place mall and see the Stepford Wives. I surmise it will be some quite entertaining. Peace...

      The Stax Museum in Memphis is saluting the Beatles on today. Mom loves the four English dudes and my favorite Beatle is John Lennon, pre and post Yoko Ono. I ran across these lyrics today and it almost amazed me that a socially-conscious song like this is not public knowledge and included in interviews, anthologies, what have you...about the Beatles. Sure we've heard "Give Peace a Chance" and "Imagine" but this one fell through the cracks. Since Women's Wednesday has been affected by the NBA Finals and my unhealthy obsession with Rip. Let this marinate...Commments are welcomed and advised.   "Woman is the nigger of the world Yes she is...think about it Woman is the nigger of the world Think about it...do something about it   We make her paint her face and dance If she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love us If she's real, we say she's trying to be a man While putting her down, we pretend that she's above us   Woman is the nigger of the world...yes she is If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with Woman is the slave of the slaves Ah, yeah...better scream about it   We make her bear and raise our children And then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen We tell her home is the only place she should be Then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend   Woman is the nigger of the world...yes she is If you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with Woman is the slave to the slaves Yeah...alright...hit it!   We insult her every day on TV And wonder why she has no guts or confidence When she's young we kill her will to be free While telling her not to be so smart we put her down for being so dumb   Woman is the nigger of the world Yes she is...if you don't believe me, take a look at the one you're with Woman is the slave to the slaves Yes she is...if you believe me, you better scream about it   We make her paint her face and dance (Repeat 6x)"  -John Lennon

      "I have to rank it as my second-greatest shot ever after the one I had to beat Rip (Hamilton) in high school..." -Kobe Bryant, after beating the Pistons in Game 2 of the 2004 NBA Finals  R.I.P., I said...That's what I said as I lowered my head in shame last night, as the ball departed Kobe's fingertips, grazing R.I.P.'s masculinity and pride and shattering the Pistons' hopes of winning game 2. If you think I've lost faith in the Pistons, you're wrong. My problem is with R.I.P. He isn't performing. Those three failed continuous shot attempts proved it beyond definition. I only hope that these past two mediocre performances in his first finals appearance haven't laid him to rest. He can and will be reborn.   Why do I think he can and will be reborn? Because I have Faith. Often times, the enemy is standing in front of us, shakes and bakes us and kills our spirit with nothing but net. And it replays in our heads, just like they replayed that fatal shot 5 times last night before the end of the game. My faith causes me to believe that situations and emotions that I thought were dead and unrecoverable can and will be reborn. And if they are not, I can simply relish in the fact that my time is coming yet 'right now' isn't my appointed time. So it may not be time for me to win some obstacles. I may have to take an L, knowing that for everything, there is a purpose and a season. This may not be me and R.I.P.'s season but hopefully, we'll know in SEVEN...Peace

      "You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for a buck fifty in late charges at the public library." - Matt Damon as Will in "Good Will Hunting" (1997)  My financial aid cleared for school today and although, I am relieved that paperwork is done, I cringed at the lump sum of loan money that will indefinitely haunt my house for the rest of my life. I was raised in a home where I was encouraged to nurture my gifts and endeavor a career that I woke up every morning excited to perform and one that would not only improve my well being but others as well. Of course, this would have been perfect if I didn't have to fund college on my own including transportation, housing, etc. Nevertheless, I have loans to pay back and I'm about to almost double that amount with graduate school. It often causes me to ask myself, why subject myself to this and what is the reward? I chose a career in non-profit because underneath my clothes, is a larger than life heart that melts at the site of children's dreams deferred. I surmise the reward will be to see a life I took out loans in school in order to be able to cultivate, bloom to its full potential. I have to remind myself that there is no price on preparing children for success. And every time I send a check to the unknown loan provider, that's another child I have saved from poverty and the lack of privilege. In essence, I guess I haven't wasted my money or my time. For those of you who are sending that check every month or slowly approaching that role, have you wasted your money and time? Have your efforts become self-serving and unproductive?...Peace

      "I've always believed that a lot of the trouble in the world would disappear if we were talking to each other instead of about each other."  - President Ronald Reagan (April 11, 1984)  I lowered my head in prayer before the Laker-Pistons Game last night. Not only because I wanted the Ultimate Dude to spread favor on Rip, Ben Wallace, Sheed, and dem, but also during the moment of silence, in respect for former President Ronald Reagan and his greiving family and friends. Reagan was president during my formidable years so all I can remember of him was that damn muppet satire of him in that Phil Collins video and everyone commenting on how ironic it was that a former b-move actor was elected president. However, I knew I could find a Reagan quote that would stimulate a conversational debate inside my psyche. (Please refer one paragraph north.)  This quote has rang true in a number of situations I have been. It occured in familial relationships when someone was having issues and the bad news traveled faster than the speed of light. Sunday dinner rolled around and that person was handled with care like a FedEx package with Fragile posted in red ink of their forehead. It occured in college when I should have disucussed the ongoing bilateral relationship a guy I dated was formulating with the other party before it escalated to psychotic behavior on her part. It occurs in everyone's life more often than not. In retrospect, I can agree that if we handle situations in a mature manner, placing the soul food on the table in front of the person who has to eat it instead of the person that cooked it, life would run more smoothly. This is seemingly an issue that is ongoing and a detriment to black women.   I've grown to the point that there is nothing I can say about someone that I won't say to them myself, always cognizant of semantics and how to phrase things, so that they are inspired by purpose and not pain. I am eager to squash pertinent issues that may escalate and result in lives beings dramatically altered. By the same token, I am also eager to refrain from addressing issues and people who don't warrant a mature conversation because the facts will only be regurgitated and fallacies will be sheltered for later display. Those people will only retain the negative and not the positive solution. I also know that everyone is functioning on different levels of maturity and prayer may be the only alternative for those who continually refuse to "get on my level."

      Yeah...ok...I promise there will be no more corny and cliche' titles.   Today I had to travel to Beautiful. Beautiful is a place that you can find peace and tranquility in the midst of chaos and confusion. So at lunch, I went and sat by the Mississippi River and WOO-SAH!, I was calm. All I needed was a good bottle of wine. More importantly, music always calms my spirit and puts it at ease. There are a couple of songs I can listen to all day. I thought I'd share them with you. Aren't I the benevolent one?  Beautiful by India.Arie A Nightengale Sang in Berkely Square by Manhattan Transfer Crash Into Me by Dave Matthews Band You Move Me by Casandra Wilson (Love Jones Soundtrack) A Song for You by Donny Hathaway Giving Up by Donny Hathaway If I was a Bird by Floetry Whenever, Wherever, Whatever (Unplugged) by Maxwell Song Cry (Unplugged)by Jay-Z Peace of Mind (Unplugged) by Lauryn Hill Tell Him by Lauryn Hill  Dang, I could go on and on...I guess there'll be a continuum to this entry too. I don't feel like thinking aymore. I'm going to start posting in the morning, post-sausage mcgriddle and pre-dutiesasassignedbyearthlydude...Peace

UDP, age 26, Memphis 10, presently, uhm, I'll sum it up in three words-Howard Black Law-...Beware because she is going to eradicate and transform the justice system. I love her because she always keeps it real and supa dupa fly. Her revolution will not be televised. #13  JLDWD, age unknown because she's been here before. I'm almost sure of it. She and AKTMH landed on the same ship Andre drove here. She's got so many levels. Her ground floor is motherhood. Baby Malachi will be thoroughly elevated and IMPERIALIZED. #20, the Tail, the Omega. Notice: She has more than one name.  EKR, age 22, Memphis 10, presently residing in ATL, shawty! Weird how a friendship can evolve from a bad love connection.   Astarte Polk, age 24, GA and VA. The only person yet who can hold down a tre as well as me. She has my respect and undying love.   My BF for Life...  LYP, age 24, Memphis 10. "Me and you must never part...nokinana...?" Or whatever the hell Ceely and her sister chant in the Color Purple. Nuff said...  I would shout out others but carpal tunnel is about to set in. There will be a Part Dos.  Speaking of to be continued, Sunday will be officially "Rip Day". He won't and can't let me down. If all else fails, maybe he can place a poster of a Colorado blonde in the stands to distract Kobe. It worked the first time...Peace.

      I have never been able to stabilize friendships with groups of women. I was invited to go to Miami for Memorial Day with a brood of hens but I declined. Yesterday was a typical holiday in the 'hood, my old stomping grounds. (I reiterate while throwing up my pinkie and thumb and three fingers for South Memphis and Third World.) The smoky aroma of barbeque fresh off the grill and dripping with sweet sauce, crumb snatchers running around strategically locating the last nerve ending in my body and pissing it off and my ageless nana saving them from the swatting switch that ironically she used to discipline us with. As I sat in the midst of four generations of Swanigan women, I observed the infinite details and authenticity of each member while marveling at the cohesiveness that makes our blood run identical. I absorbed how each one of the women were asked to contribute in some way to make the meal complete, synonomous with that of a jazz quartet. I am the youngest adult grandchild so I was left at the end of the totem pole which equates to "drink duty". Big K Sparkling Punch is a must have. My sister was on baked beans. My cousin on potato salad. Moms and Auntie on taste test and Nana, of course, performed her famous, sulky solo on ribs and poultry. The real meal began after the meal though. We sat in the living room and trades words like recipes. We first watched and competed at Jeopardy. Only two of us are degreed but we have the least knowledge at times, confirmation to me that college and higher ed is more about the experience than academics. We discussed the family reunion gospel choir as my sis and mom battled over ol skool and new skool like they were Rakim and Biggie. We discussed issues with men, family recipes and the art of being a woman. We snapped photos of Kennedy's first bike ride minus training rules and savored the joy of knowing this is only the beginning of her journey. We all took turns nurturing and bonding with the youngest Swanigan addition, Madison, and helping her come to terms that temper tantrums don't warrant our affection. We ended the night playing a game of Scrabble and watching the Lakers Game, with a second trip to the kitchen for a reload of ribs. At the end of the night, we called each other when we reached our destinations, to let someone know we were safe. And one thing I couldn't help but notice was a flaw in all of us. None of us had sustained a female group of friends. I realized that this was in part due to the fact that we have that support and cohesiveness located in our family. I guess I'll always be horrible at making friends and resistant to spending extended time with women who don't know me or understand me because the Swanigan women were there from the beginning. They know my soul and I know theirs. Peace...

      I don't know how exactly do you train someone to work for HELL, INC., selling their employment soul to the devil, but I got a crash course today. As my last day at work (August 6, 2004) approaches, I am admittedly getting a little sentimental. Aside from the ultimate dude's beezlebub likeness and lascivious nature, he's actually a teddy bear. He had one of those rare human moments yesterday at work. He bought those of us who were still at work around noon, lunch from the tasty new hot dog eatery across the street and held our attention at the conference table, embellishing stories about psychotic former love interests. Oddly and ironically enough, it was the first time I noticed that he has blue eyes. I mean, don't get me wrong, I have always looked him in the eye. I was taught at an early age to look people directly in the eye when you speak to them and give a firm handshake. But I guess I was looking past the facade and exterior and finally seeing the real him.   Sh!t like that always happens to me when I am about to get the heave ho. Oh, well.  I've been training my replacement all day today and will continue to do so all next week. Everybody claims they're quite sad about my departure. Since ultimate dude can't keep a secret (even though he lies like he's telling the truth), let the cat out of the bag about the "Sayanara Sweetie" corporate function next Friday. Plus after work, I having drinks with the Tennessee Tiaras, the unofficial blog club in Memphis. They are celebrating the first monthly event, my departure and  urlLink Little Daddy's  birthday. Rumor has it that HELL, INC. is even threatening to give me a going away present and not just any going away present....a freegin' laptop! Just because I've "set a new precedent" doing this stepandfetchit thing. What can I say? I know how to work a crowd.   I've received much from my service here at HELL, INC. Someone once told me that you should never leave a career or job without getting something from it. They should never be able to say that they exhausted you for a menial paycheck. I got marketing and event experience, a crash course in crisis communication, letters of recommendation, benefits, free lunches, great future references and a lot of unadulterated love and advice. I must say it prepared me for the worst and the best.   This weekend shall prove to be interesting, too. I'm transporting all my sh!t to HIS apartment today and tomorrow and shacking up with HIM for two whole weeks before I leave. I have family reunion gospel choir rehearsal this evening, in preparation for the main event on Sunday. I'll provide details on Monday. That'll be all for today.  love.steph

      I heard via the bootleg news in Memphis (WPTY 24) that our hometown politician, Rep. Harold Ford, Jr. is featured in this month’s issue of  Details Magazine  and credited at the next, next President, making him, if not apparent, the official people’s choice as the first Black President. But lo and behold, a new Great Black Hope has surfaced in Barack Obama, the charismatic Chicago Democrat who is currently running for the US Senate. On the surface, they are symmetric. Both are fair skinned with that good hair which equals a less than intimidating demeanor. Both are Democrats. Both can sell ice cream to an Eskimo. Most notable is that both have been key-note speakers at a DNC (Democratic National Convention). So I decided to weigh the options on what mainstream in professing as the next President and a first for the African American community.    urlLink Barack Obama   Education:  Obama, 42,  graduated from Columbia University with a degree in political science and a specialty in international relations. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude and served as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Currently a senior lecturer specializing in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, Obama has served on the boards of some of Chicago's leading foundations and chaired the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a $50 million philanthropic effort to reform the public schools.   Lineage : Obama was born in Hawaii. His mother is white and originally from Kansas. After moving to Hawaii with her parens, she met a foreign student (Barack Obama, Sr.) at the University of Hawaii. Soon after she had Obama, his father left to attend school at Harvard and then went on to work as an economist in Kenya. Obama’s mother remarried to an Indonesian oil manager who moved the family to Jakarta. At age 10, Obama moved back to Hawaii and lived with his grandparents. He attended prep school and then on to Columbia.     Family : Wife, Michelle, is also a lawyer and they have two little girls. I’m lazy so to look at a pic of the wife and kids go  urlLink here  His wife grew up on the South Side of Chicago in a working class family. On other words, folks, she is ‘hood, which means she can switch it on ya’ll. She’s trilingual, meaning she can probably speak English, Boughetto, and Ebonics.    Possible Scandal : Obama admits that as a teen, he smoked and weed and tooted a little coke. He says he included this in his memoir, “Dreams from my Father”, because he “wanted to show how and why some kids, maybe especially young black men, flirt with danger and self-destruction.”   Harold Ford, Jr.   Congressman  urlLink Harold E. Ford, Jr  (TN-09) was sworn in to represent the Ninth District of Tennessee in 1996 at age 26. Ford represents a new generation of political leaders who seek to replace the partisan politics of the past with fresh ideas and a pragmatic approach to the challenges of the twenty-first century."   Education : Congressman Ford received his law degree from the University of Michigan School of Law in 1996. He earned a bachelor's degree in American History from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992.   Lineage : Born in Memphis, Tennessee on May 11, 1970, Congressman Ford is the eldest son of former U.S. Representative Harold E. Ford and Dorothy Ford. He has two brothers, Jake and Isaac Ford.   Family : This is where the brother gets lost. He was once engaged or dating seriously but reportedly, through the Memphis rumor mill, she was uninterested in being a politician’s wife and said Ford is too consumed with politics, his career and his success. Obama has about 10 years on him so effectually he has a little time to get hitched.    Possible Scandal : The Ford name is synonymous with scandal in Memphis. Alcoholics, sexual harassment, embezzlement, you name it. They are the Kennedys of Memphis so everybody is watching them. Honestly, we all have some crackheads, lose brains and dependents in our family, so who are we to judge.   The jury is still out on who’s better looking and the truth of the matter is, I think I’d vote for either one. You be the judge….Peace.  Love.Steph

      I just witnessed approximately 100 Asians eating lunch at the same time. I seriously thought I had time warped in Tokyo. It freaked me the hell out.

      After  urlLink His  retort yesterday, I guess you good people would like to know 'how we met'. The story is quite quaint, something out of a Brother's Grimm soliloquy, a love story that would make the special section adjacent to the wedding announcements in the hometown paper.    January, 2002    It was my second semester as a transfer student at the U of M. I had become accustomed to the manicured campus and the manicured students, even vaguely desiring the trend of wearing high heels to class and trading in my air max. I was still in the midst of the love rectangle, though physically transplanted in another city. The Spawn of Satan had announced his departure from collegiate athletics and rumors were still floating of his on again/off again romance with both SHE and I. The Cookie Monster had become my safety net, a Linus-like blankie that I desperately couldn't let go of. The first day of classes, I walked into the dank classroom for History 2010. Unbeknownst to the fact that while learning history, I would be experiencing the person who would disintegrate my personal history and foretell my fantastic future.   I sat in the back adjacent to the enclave of Anglo Saxon intellectuals. HE walked in late...But to me somehow, he was right on time. He sat in the row next to me, only he was about three seat up at the head of the class. He turned and looked at me as I spouted the firstdayofclass introduction. It was the first time a man had looked at me, really looked at me. He looked past the french manicure, the demure of MAC cosmetics. He looked past the 34D's, the illegitimate heart and saw my starving spirit and the evidence left&nbsp;from a murdered heart.   In the next few weeks, I admired him from afar, calling my BF after each class, trying to muster up the nerve to say...hello. The Spawn of Satan came to visit, but even in the throngs of dinner with his agent, watching "The Last Dragon" and sipping champagne at Memphis' premier 4-star, the morning after I was angry at the freshly fallen snow, because class was cancelled, which meant, I would not see HIM today.   And then, when classes resumes, HE was gone...disappeared...or rather, withdrawed from class. I chalked it up to a schoolgirl crush.    August 2002   Forging ahead to my last semester in undergrad, I made some cuts over the summer. I dismantled the love rectangle and learned to spend some quality time with Me and God. My slate was completely clean. I sat in my last minute elective, Sociology, with a new life, minus drama and prose. I looked up and He walked in, late again. On time, again. He smiled as He slid into the rickety chair. I smiled back. A month later, I saw Him out on Beale. We conversed and I finally heard his voice, though slightly inebriated it was. We became class buddies quickly, typing papers together at 4 a.m., walking to the library post Dr. Eva Brown, sociologist to the stars. We decided to become an "us".   He placed the tiara on my head and I handed him the purple scepter. I can say that for the past 21 months and 1 day, I have felt like a princess. He still looks past the exterior and reaches the depths of me. I think HE is the one, but if not, HE is the prototype.   HE has taught me how to love, how I should be treated and how to treat a man. He walks with me through life and more importantly, down the trodden road led by the ultimate HIM.   In 16 days, I'll be separated from him physically. And as the tears roll down my cheeks at this moment, I know HE will be with me in love and in spirit, everyday. Its often said that when you speak of your love for God, if you can transplant God's name with a significant other, you have experienced what true love is. I know I have....Peace.

       Well, folks, I have employed a guest blogger today. She is a senior member of the negro clique on the plantation I call a workplace. I hope you enjoy...   "Wrote a song about it and ta hear, hear it goes..."   Perspectives from the Old Lady on the Inside  "Git Yo Own Sh!t!   Well, ya’ll don’t know me but, baby sister said I could do a guest blog today. She’s going off to college and for all of ya youngstas out there without an old lady trying to preach, do ya best, stay in school, don’t do drugs(man made alcohol, God made weed----need I say more), get the best education you can, when someone say’s "call me if you need anything" hey call, they said "anything". Why do I employ you to do all these things and more to stay on TOP?&nbsp;Well, if the truth be known,-----So Ya Don’t Havta Work Fa Mista Charlie’s triflin’, lying, crooked ASS. I been workin’ fa "him" for a long time. And the Sh*$@ Charlie gets away with just ain’t right. How can you go out and get a bank loan for a new house from the house you currently occupy that’s got liens on it to raise enough money for the downpayment on the new house your wife "must have" then "they" give you the loan , you default on it, and the bank calls you and tells you, "why don’t we just rewrite the loan for you so you won’t be in default"---! What that frigg buckets( I spent a summer in Maine as a lifeguard, it’s a colloquial cuss word up there) is up with that! There’s more---- What about taking your family on vacation, calling your office and telling the office money man to put "mad cash" into your personal bank account, cause yo wife and child (bless her heart) don’t know yo ass is broke. And people in the office wonder why we can’t get a raise-----if they really only knew. This place dodges bill collectors like it’s a month after Christmas.

      After reading  Misty's  blog today, I am thoroughly perturbed by a phenomenon that has struck men and women and begs me to ask one question, Why in the hell do you think you deserve to be with him/her?   I ask this question to all the bamas, nerds, crackheads, gold diggers, athletes, etc. It pissed me off to all oblivion when a friend told me about his friend who was salivating and beaming like Sambo because he has landed him a virgin. Aside from the fact that this chick is sneaky, conniving and changes her mind about her men at every blink, he was just pleased as punch and damn near ready to slide a ring on her finger, just because she is a 23- year old virgin. And dude was a 360 degree whore back in the day, one of them almighty athletes who got the milk and cookies without coercion or spending duckets. Now that he is "born-again", he wants to be with a virgin. I mean, WTF. Why do you and the 500 or so women you boinked throughout college deserve to tangle with the unscaved? And why does the fact that she's a virgin have you blinded to her other vices? In my eyes and from what I've been told, if you whole heartedly ask for forgiveness and repent, God will wash you whiter that snow. That's what the Good Book says. So technically, I am a virgin and so is  urlLink she  since we are enduring the arduous task of celibacy, post boinking.   The same goes for these gold digging heifers out there. What makes them think they deserve to encrue the riches that you didn't even work for? (And that night at the "W" does not count. We know that was not the first time you tried that?)Half of these heifers got&nbsp;as many issues as shoes in their closet. I&nbsp;even&nbsp;had an associate, to remain nameless, to tell me she couldn't date anyone who made less that $1 million a year.&nbsp;In my head, I was like, what the hell are you bringing to the table besides your looks, because due to your Anglo features,&nbsp;the good looks are going to start disappearing&nbsp;before you even hit the mid-life crisis. I'm glad I look like I am from the Motwiba tribe (I made that up...don't google it) because "black don't crack". Ya heard?   The moral of the story is, people, actively search for significant others who are in your league. Recognize that when you do happen to luck up by the grace of God and nail you a winner, don't get your chest all pumped out and think you can talk crazy about them when you should be kissing the ground they walk on for even considering your sorry and trifling terd-tube. For those of you who are out there with great expectations and reaching beyond the veil, in the words of Andy Dick, it's elimination time, bitches.&nbsp; Don't try that again.   Peace.

       Isley Brother's "Who's that Lady?" playing in the distance.    Setting: Sweltering hot day in a southern town at high noon. Seventy-five or so construction workers are heading toward the myriad of restaurants located adjacent to the basketball arena they are building, muttering spanglish and ebonics. A young, petite black lady appears. She walks to the corner of the&nbsp;sports and entertainment district&nbsp;to cross the half paved street. A middle-aged&nbsp;black man in a wheelchair rolls up next to her.   Lady: (thinking) How in the hell is this mofo going to roll his wheelchair across&nbsp;a half paved road? I know his wheelchair ain't got shocks to handle that.   Dude: Excuse me, ma'am.   Lady: Yes.   Dude: Has anyone told you that you are beautiful today?   Lady: No.   Dude: You are beautiful. Remember that? Have a nice day. (He rolls off in the opposite direction.)   Lady: (smiling) Thanks.   THE END   I know it seems like such a small gesture but that comment made my day. I don't know if it was his semantics or the inflection in his voice but He sounded so sincere, without it sounding lustful or laced with the intention to strike up a conversation that would inevitably lead to #10 on yesterday's "Road to Celibacy" list.   I didn't wake up with the intention of turning heads today, but I got a lot of decent looks from the opposite sex, in addition to my favorite, a dynamically dentured granny who smiled at me when I crossed the street on my way back from lunch, barely croaking out a maternal "Hey, honey." I am wearing a dress that goes past my knees and reveals more decollete than cleavage, simple black slingbacks and the essential jewelry (earrings and a watch). Its always those days when you don't put effort into making yourself up that people notice and compliment you. I know the ladies feel me. How many times have you rushed to Wally World or Wal-Greens for a $5 box perm or&nbsp;some cotton balls to perfect that pretentious pedicure or even to pick up something for Aunt Flo, with the famous Aunt Jemima scarf tied on your head or in flannel pajama pants and just when you think you've managed to escape, a tall chocolate stallion approaches you like "What's up?".   Today just reminded me how substance and a positive inner spirit and aura shines through the ostentatious attempts at physical perfection. I've been so at peace lately, so ready for things and people to be revealed to me.   Aight, I've bored you enough with the Oprah-ish talk. Peace...   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I surrendered and listened to slanderous gossip today. I had to. It was just that juicy. Check it. My favorite cousin called and commenced to divulge some info about her fiancee's clearly desperate cousin who has harbored a stalkalistic crush on yours truly since he met me at moms' birthday party in '01. Since he just didn't pass the diagnostic check, he was thrown back to the wolves and now, dates this reformed lesbian....finished laughing...right. That's like Hannibal Lecter saying he doesn't like the smell of cunt anymore. Anyways, for my protection, we'll call the fiancee's cuz...hmmm, what's fitting?...oh, we'll call him Desperado. Our sources told us that when Desperado first started dating the Retired Carpet Muncher, they engaged in an orgy with Desperado friend and his girl, who is alo a so-called Retired Carpet Muncher. Well, the two of them go at it while the boys watched. They start hunching their respective partners and then, Desperado's girl asks can they switch. I mean, WTF....Hell Naw...Fast forward to the present...Desperado and the Retired Carpet Muncher now cohabitat and he thinks he can actually turn the pro into a housewife. So all of this talk got me to thinking, especially after bible study last night, I have ten reasons to remain celibate:  1)Hell is even hotter this time of year. 2)I don't have to question whether or not Aunt Flo will visit. 3)No having to remember a patch or a pill. 4)No extra weight gain from #3. 5)The alloted time + Kegel exercises= A very happy husband. 6)My straw set, wrap, flat iron, roller set, etc. lasts a lot longer. 7)No extra guilt at CHUTCH, my other heathensitic vices are enough. 8)More time to workout (yeah right). 9)Attracting a better quality of companions. A heifer is trying to upwardly mobile and enlightened. Recognize. 10)When lames try to get at me and the "I got a man" don't work, I say "I'm celibate" and they're out of there like fried burnt bologna with the bubble in the middle.  Peace.

      First, it was that adorable Natalie from the Dixie Chicks, then it was Whoopi and now, its Linda Rodstadt. I mean, why Linda Rodstadt? She did a duet for the  The American Tale  with James Ingram, for pete's sake. &nbsp;And who doesn't love that mouse, Fival? Its all the Republican effort to use public figures to further Bush's campaign efforts.  &nbsp; Chickadee Natalie expressed how unfortunate it was that Bush shared her home state and all hell broke loose. Whoopi made the rather prevalent and comical joke about Bush and Dick. Should Slim Fast expect anything less? As far as I know, Whoopi has not changed since Jumpin' Jack Flash. She still curses. She still talks about the presidents. I would have only believed that Whoopi had changed her ways if she had cut off her dreds. (ex. Lauryn Hill and Lisa Bonet) And recently, Linda Rodstadt was escorted out of a popular Las Vegas hotel after giving accolades and support to Michael Moore and  Farenheit 911  during her concert. After she made the comments, the incessant boos from the crowd became overwhelming. People started throwing cocktails in the air. What a waste of good liquor! Nevertheless, Linda didn't get paid and is banned from the premises.  &nbsp; I was initially bruised by the actions these organizations chose but I also realized the fault of these public figures. They forgot their audience. &nbsp; A vast majority of Republicans are rural and watch the Country Music Awards religiously, are weight watchers who gulp down slim fast and other products to protect their self image or are frequent visitors who instead of gambling in Vegas, choose to spend their time catching a Barry Manilow or Wayne Newton show. Does that mean that Democrats don't listen to Shania, consider TrimSpa or gamble their money away? No. Its just that freedom of speech, especially in the case of public figures in this country, is limited.  &nbsp; Growing up, I wanted to be famous. Now, I'm happy that I am not. Because I can say things like Buck Fush, and my little blog audience will still like me. They won't stop buying into my streams of consciousness, take away my endorsements or have me escorted out of Blogspot for&nbsp;saying something they disagree with. Peace...

      I 'm not sure what the   Ultimate Dude J.Christ   is trying to reveal to me but he's definitely sending some serious signals. (Hand clap for the alliteration there...I paid attention in English class.)  &nbsp;  The past few months, I have seen almost everyone I have even been remotely romantically involved with. Guess what? There was no tingle, no jingle, no butterflies, just remorse and a big 'WTF was I&nbsp;thinking' or 'Damn, I made you look good.' And when I say there were some throwbacks that popped up, I means some straight vintage loves. I guess I'll do this in chronological order. Let me share.  &nbsp;   Ex Post Facto Sighting #1   I was riding through my soon to be former apartment complex when I spotted this half latino/half black chunky dude at the mailbox. I kept thinking to myself that I knew this cat from somewhere. The light bulb literally popped on top of the bun I've been wearing to keep from putting heat in my hair. It was CB, my grade school crush. He was my first boyfriend. He sat next to me in Ms. Schoenster's first grade class at Alcy Optional. I remember I broke up with him because he kissed my best friend Kenya and it was public knowledge that he was about to fail the first grade. I ensued a relationship soon afterwards with...(sniggle, sniggle) his best friend CT. My vindictiveness started early. Sad, I know. When CB and I started our love affair in kindergarten, I made him fight his alter ego after school for the right to be my man. What's even more sad is that I didn't even stay to watch the battle royale. I opted to hear the results via the grapevine the following school day. (*brushes right shoulder off.) Nevertheless, CB had blown up the size of the Goodyear blimp...Maybe he fathered one of Kenya's three kids. Go figure!  &nbsp;   Ex Post Facto Sighting #2   This one doesn't even deserve embellishment. 7th grad beau. I had a thing for ruffnecks and thugs. I wanted a Tupac but got a Six-Pack...of beer that is. This dude didn't miss a meal, ya know?&nbsp;JB is&nbsp;still working at Burger King in Orange Mound with a little herbal delivery on the side, grilled up and has about two kids. Go figure!  &nbsp;   Ex Post Facto Sighting #3   I had my taste of the 'big love' in grammar and middle school and consequently I was coming out of the awkward stage and turning heads of the attractive finally, in high school. On a whim, I decided to date an athlete, a basketball player to be exact. He was a starter and fairly attractive. But what I didn't know was that he wanted to compete with my heart. Notice I said not compete  for my heart but with my heart.  I swear this dude clung to me so much that I thought he&nbsp;WAS a vital organ for a while.&nbsp; I couldn't breathe without him being beside me. I finally mustered up the energy to break it off when I left for college. Current Status? I saw him about two weeks ago. I was exiting Target when the security guard yelled my name. I recognized the voice immediately because I almost went into a hypothermic shock. To make a long story short, he has also gained about 30 lbs since he doesn't play ball anymore. He's divorced at 25 with a 1-year old. Go figure!  &nbsp;   Ex Post Facto Sighting #4 (really #5)   This person tallies in at numba 4 for a reason. It was his college football number when we were...well, I can only speak for myself...when I was in dumb love. I seriously did some stupid shit when I was with/out him. We haven't spoken since the summer of '02 neither have I seen him except for on TV Sunday afternoons. Ex post facto, I never realized that he wasn't that attractive. He won an ESPY last night and I was embarrassed, very embarrassed to say that I once was crazy about him. He looks like he's on that Mary Kate (cocaina) or that Courtney Love (heroin) with a Furberry-ish (faux Burberry) suit on&nbsp;that looked like the blind and dead Ray Charles tailored it. I had to lift him and myself up in prayer. To make matters worse, who else but the love of his life was sitting beside him at the Kodak Theatre. His freegin' MOMMA. He was a total Momma's boy who had to talk to her at least once a day. True Oedipus Complex. Go figure!  &nbsp;   Ex Post Facto Sighting #5 (really #6)   I call him the Cookie Monster because he was my first... ya' know...Ineeway, he sent me a pic not long ago and I realized why I dated him. He weighs about 160 lb, wet. I guess I had got so tired of my bf's blowing up on me that I had to date somewhat quite malnourished. No attraction there, fortunately. We talk every once in a while. He has a crazy baby mama who recently tried to kidnap junior. Go figure!  &nbsp;   Random Ex Post Facto Sightings...   Then there are those FMFD (Free Movie, Free Dinner) guys who I only dated because I was in between lovers #1-5 or I was simply bored or I was broke as hell and needed libation and food. One is&nbsp;still a commitment phob and constantly asks my barber aunt about me, one is still in undergrad and has been for 7 years and another just moved into my apartment complex with his psycho chick. Go Figure!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Almighty thanks to the Father for saving me from the&nbsp;Flunky, the 8 ball lookalike, Mr.&nbsp;Aorta,&nbsp;Oedipus and the Cookie Monster. Peace.  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      “I can see your dirty pillows.”- that crazy ass Mama in Carrie.  &nbsp;  I was watching the season finale of Pepsi Smash with HIM last night and 213 performed their new single, “Groupie Love”. For those of you who are unaware of who 213 is, they are the West Coast supergroup composed of Snoop Dog, Warren G and the melodic, monotone voice that is Nate Dogg. While enjoying yet another soon-to-be club joint, I raised a question.  &nbsp;  What happened to the subtle sexual innuendo that artists used to use in their songs?  &nbsp;  Back in the day, artists would go great lengths to disguise the real intimate definition of the love song but now everything is so overt. I remember sitting in the den in 1986, singing Evelyn Champagne King’s “Love Come Down” and Rick James’ “Mary Jane”, oblivious that I was belting out an orgasmic explosion and an unhealthy addiction to cannibus. I guess what it comes down to is that artists have lost the craft of songwriting with the exception of folks like India.Arie, Musiq, etc. It was even still evident as late as 1994 with the three Tone’s “Lay Your Head on My Pillow”. Who knew at first glance that they were talking about boning? (Ha, ha…I said boning…I watched School Daze not long ago…sorry!) This overtness has even spilled over into how guys approach you now. There’s no more sweet talk or tight game, there’s only “How we ain’t gone fuck? Girl, I’m me.” &nbsp;I guess there’s no more “dirty pillows”, Carrie, just tits, boobs, jugs, melons…  &nbsp;  Damn, I miss Donny Hathaway.   Peace.

      Ok, yeah, my young exploits as an overdeveloped middle school pom/cheer girl are leaking out.  &nbsp;  My apologies.  &nbsp;  Who's the creature feature, you may ask? As I&nbsp;have mentioned in previous entries, the ultimate earthly dude constantly refers to the workhouse and his employees as a game strategy and members of an athletic team. Maybe he makes this analogy because of his failed attempts at collegiate athletics. (He swears he played football at Vandy but I concur that he rode that oak...hard...or he was a tutor and his compensation was a team uniform.) Anyhoot, I have deemed the CFO here at HELL, INC., Creature Feature. He looks like a mix between Fire Martial Bill and The Crypt Keeper.  &nbsp;  Got a visual, yet? Good.  &nbsp;  Well, he was running around trying to get HIS work done and yelling something about some tabs he needed done for this financial publication. I politely gathered my belongings to leave for lunch, he had the nerve to ask me how long was I going to be gone. To keep from losing my religion and smacking him attractive, I kept my back turned and said "I'll be back in an hour or so." He says, "That'll be fine." See, what Creature Feature does not understand is that his signature is not on the official HELL, INC. paycheck so don't tell me when its okay for me to be back. Ok? So he needs to be taken out of the game, quickly before we need to have a team mediator.  &nbsp;  But here's the sad part and why, when I returned from lunch, I promptly filled his request. Dammit. The Wiz gave me a heart.  &nbsp;  The background on ol' dude is pretty heartbreaking. One night while he was in college, he came home and found his parents massacred. He had to go through the arduous and janky justice system only to find out that the authorities could not find the killers. His first wife had a gambling problem and took him for mad paper...mad ends, son. Ya know? Plus, some gold digging heifer is trying to nail him against the wall as we speak. Creature Feature has had it hard. (moment of silence)  &nbsp;  Nevertheless, the next time he tries to regulate my time, all that sympathy will be past due. Recognize, HELL INC. don't pay me enough to actually ask me to perform duties not described in the employee manual, such as bailing you out when you were too busy trying to appease said gold digger. Get your mind right.  &nbsp;  With all that being said, I want to dedicate this day to one of favorite bloggers.  urlLink  . I suggest everyone read her today. It was quite a good read. Iyanla ain't got nothing on her. Peace...

      I got this from fellow Memphis babe  urlLink Kalisah   FIRSTS   First job: McAlister's Deli...Yes, I know how they make those superhuman baked potatos.  First screen name: sswaniga...my freshman email address at UTK.  First self-purchased CD: Its sad that I have literally spent three minutes thinking of an answer because I have so many bootleg copies of CD's. Let me think real hard...TLC's "Oooh....on the TLC tip" or maybe it was "Hold On" by Wilson Phillips.  First piercing/tattoo: Since I really don't count my ears, I would have no other option than to confess that I pierced my nose junior year of undergrad on a dare...hanging out with that damn Kai. (club owner line sister in ATL with the fifteen names)  First true love: What messed me up on this one was the word "true". I had a bunch of false alarms but the first true one was in college with a guy who I preferred to call the "Spawn of Satan". He's a good guy just misguided. However, I wish my first true love ended up being my current beau but I guess you have to go through a couple of practice runs to know how to win the race.  First enemy: This may make ya'll flip out but my first eenemy was Lashundra...still don't ring a bell?...well, she's better known as Trenyce from American Idol 2. She hated me in middle school because of, you guess it, a boy. We're cool now. I saw her at the Golden Arches picking up breakfast one morning and we chatted a minute. I've only had a couple of earthly enemies and all have been over a boy. Women can be so catty sometimes...Peace.

      As I swing on a lamp pole,  "Someone to care, Someone to share, Lonely hours And moments of despair,  To be loved, to be loved! Oh, what a feeling, To be loved!"  -Originally recorded by Jackie Wilson but remembered most as performed by Akeem (Eddie Murphy aka Darkness II) in "Coming to America".  I have to admit, ya'll gave me some cyber love yesterday in my moment of fearful confessions. Thanks for the kind words. And as Cube would say, Today was a Good Day (OO-wah, OO-wah)...I loved that song.  Guess who I finally heard from today, Daddy Warbucks. I'm still tireless but after I exude my fire on him, I will have a new set of P19570R14s. Trust. I emailed him on yesterday because I took a long look in the mirror and realized that I inherited my communicative cowardice from him. The reason I love email and hate face-to-face conversation is because of him. He knew he had done me wrong so email was the easy way out and unfortunately, I gave it to him. But DNA don't fail me now. I also inherited my sly vindictiveness from my mom. I've added a few more items to the Daddy-do list and scratched off a few from the Honey-do list. I am asking for more that just the tires and instilling punitive damages for my pain and suffering. Ya'll read how messed up I was when I hadn't heard from him. Let's see, what else made today a good day...oh!...the earthly ultimate dude aka the boss is on a weeklong vacation. I bought a $70 microwave for $30 yesterday, then found out that my nana was secretly trying to buy me one. She's soooooo sassy and sweet so I'll have to call her today and faintly mention I bought one for the low, low and ask her to get something less expensive. My mom grabbed my list of "needs for school" this morning and offered to "pick up a few things" and called me about thrity minutes ago to say she's planning me a going away get together...ahhhh...to be loved. The most important thing out of all this for me to remember is that it all came from the Ultimate Dude. He takes such good care of me even amidst my lustful thoughts throughout my battle with celibacy, my verbal uh-ohs, my lazy prayers...the list could go on and on. I guess I need to start holding up my end of the deal better. For example, the other HE that I capitalize often glanced over at my tithing envelope on Sunday and looked at me like "Whoa, did you get a raise or something?" and I'm like, "Hell, no" but I said it in a nice "i'm in the House of the Lord" way. I mentioned that the figure tallied was a tenth of my gross. He said he paid a tenth of his net. I quizzed a couple of my fellow Ultimate Dude Fanatics and they gave me the same answer. So I concluded I had been paying extra. I entertained the thought of paying exactly what my cohorts were paying, which is $30 less, but now, I'm going to put a little extra in. It won't be what I used to pay, because if nobody else knows, the Lord knows my back 2 school struggle. However, the Ultimate Dude deserves it....Peace.

      I woke up in a sweat around 5 a.m. to a LAPD-ish knock at the door. I rub the morning dew out of my eyes and look out the peep hole. I take a deep sigh before I open the door, readying myself for the inevitable fate. The old battleax is standing there in her garnet splendor and swiftly karate kicks me in the gut. I barely mutter through the excrutiating and familiar pain, "Good Morning, Aunt Flo."  Yes, that heifer woke me up bright and early this morning. Ain't no alarm clock like the deafening buzz that is Aunt Flo. I spent the morning comatose over my desk, praying for the Aleve to kick in. Needless to say, after lunch, I felt recuperated and now I can share my liturgy with you.  My weekend was cool. I attended a going-away-to-grad school barbeque for MEBrown on friday with mi nuevo. I was pms-ing all Saturday so I accomplished zero. Sunday belongs to the Ultimate Dude. The church just moved into a new building so its going to take some adjusting.   This morning's visit, leaving for grad school and the new church environment had me speculating why do we take change so hard. It sometimes causes our senses to break down and adjusting to the differential equation becomes like rocket science. Its getting scary just thinking about me finally living by myself in less than a month. There'll probably be more entries post midnight since I'll have trouble sleeping. I admit I am slightly afraid of the dark. I'm slightly afraid of being alone. I'm going to miss being held, emotionally, physically and spiritually. But I realize that this is God's way of making sure I can become earthly autonomous and become abreast that I am never really alone because Je-sus walks....Je-sus walks with me. Funny how getting my . this morning pepetuated another epiphany....Peace.

      I usually don't post more than once a day but I am bored and I almost forgot to mention the dream I had last night. First of all, mad props to Henry (animpossiblemasterpice.blogspot.com) for calling me, a black woman, out on the usage on the n word. I lke for people to challenge my thinking. Although, T used the word in the context of being satirical and it was quote from my attempts at hip hop stardom circa age 15, I understand you and Mr. Cosby's viewpoint. The n word and cursing are two vices I have had trouble with, especially in the thrusts of anger, as was the case this morning. But anyway, oh...yeah...my dream...Get this. I had a dream I was working on the campaign team for Kerry/ Edwards. It was election day. Guess who won the presidential re-election? Key word= RE-ELECTION. Its almost safe to call that a nightmare instead. Anyhoot, I am calm from my outburst this morning. I shouldn't let people get to me. Yep, I have that issue. I really shouldnt let people get to me...Peace.

      "Niggas tryin' to test me like this b&*%* is straight from the 'burbs. They trying to bring out that funk in me, mami, f*^% what you heard..."  I rarely quote expletives but an incident at work this morning almost caused me to lose my religion. This above quote came from a song that my alter ego wrote when I remotely considered a career as a female MC. I had the street cred because, as I have stated in numerous entries, I hail from South Memphis aka "Funkytown" and migration to the 'burbs has not changed me when the heat approaches. Those hip hop efforts became futile when I discovered that I could only be, as Foxy says, and "industry chick" because I can't flow or freestyle. I would straight go "8 Mile" Eminem on ya'll, regurgitated spaghetti and all. Note: I use the word 'niggas' like Axl Rose did. Its to be defined as just trifling, undermining, good for nothing folks who say and do foul stuff. There's no melanin attached to it so when I say it, don't be offended. Mind you, its still not kosher for pale face to use the word in any definitive usage. Trust me on this. I still love ya'll though!  Nevertheless, I was about to go postal on this lawyer visiting our office. Check it. We all know how I am counting the days before I exit this hell hole for grad school. 29 days to be exact. This fool is about to walk out the door and decides to introduce the office post graduate intern aka the office do-girl aka me, to his associate. Like I really gave a flying *expletive*. And he has the cajones to say and I quote "If you ever call the office and need to talk to *John, she's who'll lie to you about his whereabouts. (Laughing)" Of course, by hood habit, I cocked my head to the side and almost bucked at this fool. I had a true Ally McBeal moment. Imaginarily, I jumped out of my seat behind my desk and pummelled this a-hole to a pulp, boxed him in a DHL packed and express mailed his stupid ass back to St. Louis. Ariba, F-ing, Derche or however you spell it. I am mad as hell because I try very hard and have become quite creative in not lying for the ultimate earthly dude. If he tells me to say he's not here, I say HE advised me to tell you that he will be unavailable and will call you when he returns. It may be psuedo deception but when it comes down to it, I am spitting the unadulterated truth. And to add to the crackhead credentials of lawyer dude, when we first started dealing with him, we weren't dealing exactly with HIM because he was doing quick time in the FED for bribery. And this shady mofo wants to call me out. F-u, pay me, Attorney K., I hope you go take a leak and wind up pissing nails. Don't question my character again! Comprende?  Thank you for listening. I'll pay the attendant on the way out and set my appointment for tomorrow. Did you say noonish?..Peace.

      Do all white men with goatees like black women?  Do all black men without facial hair like white women? Are you tired of Usher yet? Why when a car zooms by you on the freeway, swerving through lanes, does it usually have a drive out tag in the window? Do they put something in the new car scent that makes you drive like a maniac? But that can't be possible because even people who have just bought super used cars do this too, right? How does Pamela Anderson sleep and avoid osteoporosis? Why is there such a big deal about J.Lo and Beyonce's booty when that comedienne (don't know her name)from the 80's who played in "The Women of Brewster Place" and "Jungle Fever" had them both beat? What happened to Marlon Brando? Did you see how fine he was back in the day? Why did ESPN do a two day long segment on what if Kobe went to Duke, when clearly God made sure he didn't because we wouldn't have the joy saying "Who's Your Daddy?" or we would have been asking know who in the hell the black Jason Williams is? Serena Williams and Lavar Arrington used to date. Her body deserves applause but wouldn't sex between her and a humungous football player like Arrington be like watching two men? Why doesn't "My Wife and Kids" get the credit it deserves? Who else is ready for the new UPN Monday night season? Why is the little girl who disappeared from the "Family Matters" cast a porn star now? Who knew Carl Winslow and Uncle Phil were gay? Who heard the rumor that Lil' Jon used to date Mya and now is dating Christina Milion? Why are people calling Nina Sky the new Zhane'? Why have I become addicted to reading blogs? Why do I have no idea what my favorite bloggers look like? Who in the hell left the gate open?

      We all know that my attempts to parlay in New Orleans for the Essence Fest were thwarted and I had to partake in option B...Atlanta, GA...(I always have an option B, yes, in every facet of my life, an option B lurks in the background)...Well, my friends, I had a good time. I had a better than good time. I got the answer to two uncertainties in life asked by a many of post-graduates. Do I really have any friends? When will I benefit from ignoring collegiate intellectual experience to enjoy the throngs of a social life? Here this, I got the VIP treatment in the ATL due to good people I have surrounded myself with these past years of growness. I rested, slept and passed gas freely in the Doubletree Hotel for 40 BUCKS A NIGHT! My best friend for 12+ years works for Hilton and got me the hook up on a suite with a sweet balcony, king sized bed and enough room to do the do, if only I wasn't withholding sexual funds. (Celibacy is like a trust fund you don't get until you're 18, only to find out God wants you to stay 17 for a few more years than normal.) First stop was Dave and Buster's, in which the experience was likened to a grown ass Chucky Cheese. (HIS words, not mine) Plus my girl, bless her heart, who transferred us from the hotel to the Chucky Cheese, Adult Years wasn't well versed on how to entertain grown folks, who have grown past fishing in the sea of those who frequent the clubs. Nevertheless, the bed was calling after the long drive so we went to sleep and rested for the next day. Early Sat'day, I had donuts and juice and dressed myself. My best friend was the tour guide for the day. We went to Little Five Points and the Virginia Highlands. It was cool venture...lots of thrift shops and eccentric boutiques... a cool bookstore where I was interrupted during my speech on the invalidity of an establishment that doesn't sell Giovanni by this kid who kept repeating "Gimme my Fruit Punch" to his little sister in the foyer....damn crumb snatchers...I love kids, I really do, just quite difficult to picture me with any right now. I ate at the Cheesecake Factory Sat'day Night and got a nice table by the door. I was a punk and ordered the strawberry cheesecake. I should have took my own advice and thought outside the box and got the turtle cheescake. Hindsight is so transparent. Next, I ventured over to my line sister's nightclub, The Living Room. I got the excellent VIP treatment, skipped a bunch of unworthy peasants, sat in VIP and drank free all night. I was J-kwanish (tipsy) by the time I reached the hotel. I jumped in the jacuzzi and headed for the bed. I slept well and departed Atlanta pleased but longing to stay longer. When I got back to Memphis, I ran by Nana's to catch some remnants on the BBQ...Good as usual...but shhhh! don't tell her that Fat Matt's in Atlanta had her beat. I didn't have to work yesterday so I took it as a day of rest and recoup. My major observation of Atlanta was that it needs to compete with San Francisco on the Gay Capital of the US Award. I actually saw the Gay White Pages Directory. Well, I also found out that its good to have friends and sorors who care and will show you a good time when you visit. I felt loved...It is much appreciated...My mouth is dry from typing. GIMME MY FRUIT PUNCH...Peace.

      Setting: I'm lying on the sofa at Nana's desperately waiting for my nephew's birthday party to begin. My manicured feet are propped on the arm of the sofa and my phone is propped up to my ear.  Special Friend: What was the last CD you purchased?  Me: Uh, I don't know...hmmmm...Oh, Norah Jones.  Special Friend: That white chick?  Me: (slightly perturbed) Yes.  Special Friend; What is the last CD you thought about buying?  Me: Well, yesterday I was in Best Buy and picked up Janis Joplin's Greatest Hits, Aerosmith's #1s, and Miles Davis' KInd of Blue. I've been wanting the latter for a while.  Special Friend: You're weird, man...clearly...   The moral of the story is: why can't we young so-called edumacated black folks think outside the Black Music Box?

      This Saturday I will be a bridesmaid for the first time in my life. In November, I will be ordained a Godmother. The stress of it all is a little deafening.  My five-month pregnant best friend is getting married in two days in a small, quaint ceremony at horticultural courtyard in Memphis. Her wedding was planned by the Pastor and the First Lady (her parents) in two weeks. (That should be a record.) They were logically vehemently concerned that she be married by the time she had the baby. So in comes two extremely important roles I have to play to solidify my nine year friendship with "QP".   She's my girl so if she called me today and told me to drive recklessly to Pastor P's church and stand adjacent to her at the altar in my workhouse attire, I would. Being her maid of honor, is almost the greatest honor she could give. I think I can survive this one, even the long stares as I walk down the aisle.( I think I suffer from Anxiety Attacks. I don't like attention to be pointed at me.)  The kicker is being slapped with the huge responsibility of being a Godmother. I think people don't take as much caution as possible when they select someone for this honor. You can't pick your smoking patner. You can pick your bong buddy. You can't pick your line sister (I'm not talking about sororities...I'm talking about that coca-ina...) I am going to be a Godmother, which means God is going to hold me responsible for this child's spiritual upbringing....silence....Wish me luck, people.  I have practice for the nuptials Friday at 6:00 (found this out yesterday) so I won't be able to stay as long as I'd like at the  urlLink Tennessee Tiara  function. They'll have to forgive me for my brief appearance. I have to perform my duties as a best friend.

      I was sitting in bible study last night and the First Lady was talking 'bout how her father was a good provider, how he worked overtime to make sure she got the finer things in life and how he pushed her do things she didn't understand or weren't the status quo. It made me reminisce about my childhood and just how privileged I was, especially since I grew up in da hood. I attended optional/honors schools and took advanced study classes, played the violin, was a debutante, visited Canada and  Hawaii, placed in All West and All State in vocal performance and was encouraged to listen to ALL music. I attended the "Fame"-like high school in Memphis, which defintely prepared me for the diverseness of society. I witnessed girls tongue kissing in the hallways, choir boys and their bath-house induced trips to the evacuated bathrooms, punk rockers, haute couture, rednecks, goths, sidity committees, you name it. I was exposed to everything, which made me so aware of how to deal with individualism and free expression. My mom bought me the Barbie rainbow coalition. I had a Black Barbie, White Barbie, Hawaiian Barbie and a Latino  My Child  I named Maria. Why did I name her Maria? I named her Maria because I was loved  West Side Story . I grew up watching Ann Margaret and Elvis Presley as Frankie and Johnny, Natalie Wood play a Latino woman in West Side Story, recognizing the original Latin bombshell was not J.Lo but Rita Moreno, memorizing the choreography to Grease, struggling to hit the high note in Phantom of the Opera...I was a little black girl strategically placed to be as cultured and versatile as possible. My mom always said that she wanted me to able to converse with the President and five minutes later, rap with the brother standing on the corner. I think I was thoroughly prepared for that.  Nevertheless, there are some things that I wish I would have continued to nurture. I am seriously considering taking up the violin again. I could have been the next Yo Yo Ma or some sh!t (even though he plays the cello but you get the picture). The moral of the story is, there are numerous things that your parents "force" you to do as a child that when you reach adulthood, you wished you would have nurtured. What's yours?

      Senator John Edwards (D) will be visiting Memphis this week and the authorities have been doing their "Enemy of the State" type stuff, making sure no one in the vicinity of where he'll be stationed is a "potential threat". Exciting, huh? My godfather sent me  urlLink this  the other day so I decided to share. Click on Bush and Kerry's face.

      My family reunion was this weekend. My family is unedited entertainment. Kinda like a black version of that blue collar redneck show that comes on Comedy Central. I didn't participate in any of the other festivities but decided to sing in the family gospel choir for the memorial service on Sunday. I had almost forgot how freegin' hilarious my family is.   Classic Moment #1 I sat next to my crazy cousin Charlotte at the service. She was in the choir stand crackin' on everybody. I was trying to hold in my laugh since I was sitting directly behind my old pastor, that same dude that "took me to the waaaaater, to be baptized". So we have this third cousin who is the daughter of a famous singer from Memphis and she's pretty well acclaimed herself. Round about ten years ago, homegirl had a nervous breakdown and is on serious meds to shake the devil off, right? She was in her normal bag lady attire, although she's loaded as hell, so why did my cousin Charlotte lean over and whisper in my ear "Don't it look like butterflies flying around her head?" I almost lost it but I regained my composure. Nevertheless, when we were negro spiritualling out of the church at the end, cousin baglady decided, of her own volition, to play the piano as accompaniment. Nope. Nobody asked her to do it. She just decided to play. I mean, WTF. The sh!t reminded me of that spooky Mario Winans video where he's playing an air piano.   Classic Moment #2 My immediate family is the worst. We gossip and snap on everybody. I'll share some nicknames. There's this cousin who still, to this day, wears those chopstick side burns like Lionel from the Jeffersons. We called that nigga, "Burns". There's my uncle who is a former crackhead. He used to coach high school football and is like three hours away from his master's, just never finished. When he was living with my nana, after his divorce, he would assemble us in one room and try to school us on the "man". We called that nigga, the "Professor". Why? I'm glad you asked. Its not because he was an erudite brother who always had some profound and intellectual deposits. Its because he would walk around my nana's South Memphis home in a freegin' burgundy lint matted housecoat that cut mid-thigh, with a freegin ascot. To top that off, he would be drawsless. That's right. NO UNDERWEAR in that short ass robe. Just straight nasty. Have ya'll ever seen that movie "Nothing But Trouble" starring Demi Moore and Chevy Chase? The one with the Tupac and Digital Underground cameo? Well, I know you remember them two fat nasty twins that work at the dump. Bobo and LaLa. Well, Bobo and Lala got some replicas in Memphis. My uncle and his girlfriend weight could probably take Ruben Studdard and Monique in a fist fight, hands down. They gorge food and pile their plates mile high. Then they have the nerve to kiss and smooch and sh!t. Straight gross. Hence, Bobo and LaLa.  Classic Moment #3 Our side of the family ultimately convened at nana's after the service. My aunt was rambling about how she disagreed with the exec committee not having a reunion next year. My aunt is bitter as hell over various sh!t that happened when she was a child and as an adult so she holds no punches when she talks about folks. This was the dialogue that ensued.  Bitter Aunt: Where was (insert cousin's name here) and his bald headed ass girlfriend.   Uncle Huggy Bear: They were at the picnic yesterday.  Sister: (smiling) why do you call her bald headed? Is her hair that short?  Bitter Aunt: Hell Naw. That heffa got Alopecia.  THE END  I mean, WTF. I died of laughter. I'm still laughing. On that note, I'm out. I'll have more later.  love. steph
