      It all started with Saturday. It usually does. Originally I was going to go over to the church for the work day - I love painting an weeding which were the two main objectives. HOWEVER, I ended up working at the tea house where a total of one person came in in the period of three hours. Hence, at 12:30 Ms. Peggy told me that I could go home because she seriously doubted anyone else would come in. So, I went home, with the intention of changing and then convincing my mom to take me back to the church, because the work day was still in progress. Mom, however, was not in the best of moods and said that she wasn't going to spend all day driving me around. So, that was the end of that, well not entirely, as I did get teased about not showing up Sunday. So *sighs* I spent the day reading, listening to book tapes, writing and crocheting.  Sunday was rather uneventful so far as Sundays go. I woke up at six was downstairs for breakfast at seven and out of the house with my parents by 7:45. Then I stood at the front door from 8:00 - 9:00 greeting people, which is always amuzing. I love watching how people come up the curb in front of the door. Some people hop, some people fall over it and some lift up on both feet and then come in. Lol. It's great anyhow. Then I took notes on the sermon until 11:00, just because I'm not really interested in the current topic that pastor is on (he's trying to prove against evolution and an old earth, something I have already put a considerable amount of time into researching) and so I had to find a way to stay focused. Then I wandered, somewhat aimlessly as both Nessa and Ben weren't there so I really had no one to talk to. Punched Kyle just to say I punched someone and so I felt much better about the issue between my friends. We listened to short term missionaries from Afghanistan report about their work and then went home, where I'm pretty sure we just sat around like bumps on a log for the remainder of the day. Monday was fun. After sitting around for most of the day we went swimming and such at the Safer's house. And now I have to go again so more later.

      Ok, so you know how females can be rather cattish and annoying (I'm female so I can get away with this)because they have feelings as sensitive as a bubble made by the waves in the ocean? Well I've always prefered to hang with guys because of this. However, the annoying reality is that guys can be just as cattish. Please tell every guy on the face of the earth that if they stare at me they just might get their nose punched in. I'm so sick of guys liking me. Wait that sounded wrong. I like guys as friends but not as people who have crushes on me. And please, if I talk about my friends can't they just smile and nod. How is it any different than me talking about them? But I guess guys will be guys and ranting won't change them, although I wish it would.

      This is a song I wrote when I was thinking about my Mama singing me to sleep when I was little  Mama forgot the Lullabies   The songs my mamma sang me Will stay close to my heart And you know that often lately I've been singing them by heart From the memories she implanted Even though I was so young I've never taken it for granted The songs Mama sang while she rocked  In the rocking chair in the front room When she forgot the lullabies From her perch on my bedside When we were running out of time And in the doorway of my bedroom When she thought I couldn't hear The best times were when Mama forgot the lullabies  The songs my mamma sang me Weren't always right on time She sang Silent Night at Easter Hossana at Christmas time But it never really mattered Because when I heard her voice I'd never take it for granted When she sang while she rocked  In the rocking chair in the front room When she forgot the lullabies From her perch on my bedside When we were running out of time And in the doorway of my bedroom When she thought I couldn't hear The best times were when Mama forgot the lullabies  I'll never forget how she looked at me When I asked her for just one more Cause when Mom forgot lullabies Her voice soared with God's word  In the rocking chair in the front room When she forgot the lullabies From her perch on my bedside When we were running out of time And in the doorway of my bedroom When she thought i couldn't hear The best times were when Mama forgot the lullabies.

      It's like seven hours since I last wrote anything which means that in some way shape or form I'm dying to get ahold of a pencil, pen or keyboard. Any will do. So the keyboard is chosen. Now, shall I rant or shall I make everyone laugh simply by not ranting and talking about something else entirely to put me in a good mood? RANT  Ok so I was at work today. I work at this cute little tea house downtown, which is just a fancy word for "don't blink or you'll miss it" Colorado. So anyway. It's called Past and Repast Memories and is so cute, being placed in an old house with the original flooring. It's yellow and white and when you walk in it smells like tea and quiche. (People come from Boulder, four hours away, to eat Peggy's quiche.) So I walked in and there are already people sitting down, and it's only 10:30. I go into the dish room and start putting up air-dryed dishes from Sunday or Monday (I can't remember what day they were last open) and talking to the cook. Well then I had a group of fifteen walk in and I got 9 of them to take care of. Well the group of four didn't walk in until after the rest of their group was seated and then they threw a fit because even though they didn't have a reservation they wanted us to make it so they could all sit together. The tea house ain't that big people. So we eventually worked it out and they left good tips but *sighs* anyway.  Now I'm mindlessly being irritating to my friends on the internet. Or I should say "friend." See, there's only one person on and so I don't have much choice of whom to annoy. Well I'm out of anything to say, which is odd, but I'll be going now.

      In "Little Women and Good Wives" Laurie asks Jo if she would ever want to see what was in the future. She replied that she wouldn't. Life was too perfect right then to be able to look ahead and see the pain and sorrow that could come. That made me think. So often I want to know what is going to happen in my life and why it is going to happen that way. Sometimes I think, oh, if I had only known that life would go this way I would have ________. But I know it isn't true. I would have panicked if I had seen how life would go. And it is better this way, not to know what is coming so that you can live each day as it comes. If we knew exactly when we would die, we would live around that day. Or if we knew we would have a car accident one day we would all stay inside.  I have big dreams. I know that all of them will not succeed. But I still try to make them all succeed and to reach for them as far as I can. Once again the American life calls. But this time in a good way. An extra day of waiting tables so I have to go and leave with short incomplete thoughts as always.

      I go running through the house making enough noise to be an oversized elephant. Up the stairs to my room down the stairs to the basement for crackers. Run back upstairs and mindlessly irritate my friends over the instant messenger all the while praying  someone  could possibly break up the monotiny of lol, hehe's and all that other filler garbage that works for conversation. Eventually I tire of everyone's happy moods and skip (I don't think it is possible for me to walk if I wanted to) down the hall and pull out my flute. It shreaks and moans as I'm not in a good mood and am not being careful about how I play the notes. It comes out more as a peacock hollering than anything that could be remotely called music. Giving up with complete exasperation I go downstairs and open the somewhat creaky hinges of Mama's upright piano. I go through a few songs yelling at myself for the fact that I can't seem to focus on anything and, once again, my music is not sounding like music at all, but rather a coyote that got stuck in a trash compactor. I use that phrase so often that I wonder if anyone has ever heard a coyote stuck in a trash compactor, and if so how the poor animal got stuck in it. Giving up on doing anything constructive I slather sunscreen on my olive colored skin, grab a book, hat, sunglasses and water, and bounce down to the basement and outside to soak myself in sun and read. Being extremely sick after a wet and altogether dreary weathered camp and having gotten stuck on antibiotics, therefore not having tanned for three weeks, I am extremely happy to put some of those irritating things refered to as tan lines on my skin. I flip to my marked spot in "Little Woman and Good Wives" and start reading. I read through Amy going abroad until Beth is getting so sick that everyone knows she is going to die and then put the book down. I hate reading the part where she dies. People shouldn't die in life. It ruins the perfection that has been placed on earth. But of course, we humans had to mess that up and go and eat an apple. And if Eve hadn't done it you would have, so stop making me preach. After an hour of 95 degree weather I can't take anymore. I convince my sister to come in from the pool so I don't have to watch her anymore and mosey up to my room again where I bury myself in the latest story I'm concocting. That doesn't last long because no matter what anyone says, the only time imagination flows properly is at night when your dreams can get big and you can reach for the moon.  I think perhaps I reach for the moon too much. But, as Audrey Hepburn in "Sabrina" says, "Oh no father, the moon is reaching for me." So perhaps dreams do reach for us and we just pick them up as we go along and never think twice about claiming to have found them.  If perhaps life were simpler I might have the lesiure to write all day and not have to worry about being called away. However, right now life calls once again, and I must go on and live life like it was never meant to be lived. The American way - to rush on with life never stopping to smell the roses and then decide they are so delicious you simply must stay and sketch them.
