      Why does it seem like those around you always have something to say about things that have nothing to do with them? Why do people think that their opinion on your situation is somehow more important than your own? Why do they think that what their assessment and solution to the problems in your life are far more superior than your own? These questions are very puzzling to me. It must be ingrained in human nature to get into other peoples' business. I guess it's one thing to give a friend honest advice when they ask for it, but I don't see the point in trying to push your feelings about someone else's problems upon him or her. It's really just insulting because they are basically implying that they know  how to live your life better than you. It's like this crazy fucking cycle that never seems to let up. Do you want a friend or a second mom?  I think many people may be guilty of "giving others advice". The key is being able to identify when your opinion is actually wanted versus you just wanting to tell someone how they should live. If everyone could attain and practice this idea, then surely the world would be a much better place. So don't fucking tell me how to live my life. Don't tell me I have been a bad friend. Don't give me any shit about the choices I make because I have a lot more to worry about than your worthless fucking opinion.

      The results are here.  Indian food and liquor does NOT mix well.  It was fine that night, but the next day was hell.  I don't think I have felt that shitty in a long time.  Anyways, this weekend went by quickly.  School keeps getting closer and I feel the need for a change.  No more drinking every night, no more staying up late, and no more wasting money on stupid shit.  It has got to end.  I figure that I should get a good start on it now before school so that I will already be on the right track when school begins.   Spaten Optimator is my favorite beer right now.  I mean they have been making it since 1397 in Germany.  That's what I call standing the test of time.  It is delicious and strong as hell.  I love it and you should too.

      I read an article about how the US government is blocking research on medical marijuana. I just want to know when they are gonna learn that they will never be able to get rid of drugs in this country. The war on drugs ignores the basic law of supply and demand. That when there is a demand for a product, there will ALWAYS be someone to supply it. The question then becomes is that someone going to be ruthless drug cartels from all over the world, or is it going to be from legitimate businesses within the US that can actually be taxed? You continue to allow criminals to make money by keeping drugs illegal, or you can legalize them and make money from their sale. I mean tobacco kills far more people every year than all other drugs combined and it' s legal so what the fucking problem. The fucking problem is stupid uptight fucks that don't know anything and think drugs are morally wrong and therefore they should be illegal. It seems odd to think that the people that know the least about drugs are in control of keeping them illegal. And how about this http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html. Looking through this you see a shit load of things you have probably never heard of in your life. I find it odd that drugs like THC, DMT, and magic mushrooms are all schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 being the least likely to be legalized. So I ask you what schedule is cocaine and crack on this government list? Schedule 2! Fucking schedule 2. That means that marijuana is less liking to be legalized that cocaine according to it's scheduling. Anyways, I need to go so I will have to continue this some other time.

      The plan for tonight is stated in the title.  This Indian restaurant just opened up so I decided I would go check it out.  I am hoping that it will be real good because if it's not the scene there could get ugly.  Then I will stock up on lots of liquor and have a drinking/chinese action film party at a friend's house.  I am hoping everything will go smoothly and that the Indian food and alcohol will settle nicely together in my stomach.

      I read an article today from yahoo news stating that Bush wants to be a "peace president". He goes on to say that he was thrown into war and no president wants to be a "war president". I am just wondering how exactly he was thrown into Iraq. He can try to blame it on bad intelligence or some other totally fucking bogus excuse, but the fact of the matter is he already had the war machine going and he didn't want to stop it. He ignored the UN in their requests to wait until WMD were actually found.&nbsp; Then Bush said fuck you and sent in troops anyways. Our president is a lying motherfucker who doesn't even have the balls to take the blame for his screw ups. I honestly wish that instead of sending US soldiers into Iraq to die for no reason, president Bush would have scheduled a boxing match with Saddam. That seems pretty fair to me. George Dub versus some old ass ruthless dictator. Surely he would win, right? Obviously Bush didn't think so because he sent in other people to do his dirty work. The interests of the wealthy are once again catered to and yet none of their sons and daughters are in Iraq dying. That seems really unfair to me. But what the fuck do I know? One thing for sure, war DOES NOT improve the economy. I am so fucking sick of hearing that war is good for the economy. People making money off this war are the arms, ammunition, and other various weapons manufacturers. Not only are they making money off the war, but they are making money of the deaths of Americans. In closing I would just like to add that America is a fine country and I think it's just unfortunate that we have a government full of greedy assholes that go around and fuck shit up in other countries. Despite the media's lies, most terrorists probably hate the foreign policies and actions that America enacts far more than the American people themselves.

      Hillary Duff is really just Satan disguised as a stupid ass girl. I saw the previews for that bullshit new movie she is in and I was almost sick. It goes to show that entertainment today is ruled mostly by people that apparently "look good", but have no fucking talent at all. Actually, I think that Hillary Duff is a giant bag of living and breathing shit. This brings me to a great idea I came up with. First, I win the lottery big time. I mean millions of fucking dollars. Then I spend a bunch of money on getting an entire set of diamond teeth. I will have all my real teeth removed, screws set in my jaw, and then the diamond teeth installed. Every rapper in the world would shit his pants when he saw my teeth. I could be in all kinds of movies because what movie wouldn't be better if it had a guy with all diamond teeth in it. I wouldn't need talent at all because my image would erase the need for that. Which brings my back to my original statement. It's not just Hillary Duff that sucks, it's all these stupid fucks that I see all the time on TV. Everyone could be just like them if they could sink to the level of getting by solely on their image. Some may say that I am just jealous because I am not one of those people, but that is not the case. I would hate to be one of them, because I would have to live with knowing that I was a talentless piece of shit that totally sucked and then I would have to kick my own ass.

      This weekend was too much. Little sleep and lots of getting fucked up. I feel like shit, but a good rest should clear that up. At least I had a lot of fun. It's been a while since I've had that much fun. Although I did realize that school starts again in about a month. I fucking hate school.

      Yes Singha is delicious.  It is also rather strong, which makes a great combo for any beer.  It's a shame that it's so expensive, but if you get a chance to try some you should.  Schools starting and I am only enrolled in 12 hours.  Needless to say I am pretty excited to be going back.  Sharpen my skills, warm up the brain farm, and shit like that.  It's funny that I am excited to go back.  I bet I'll be hating it in a month.  Oh Well.  This was a stupid post which served as a shameless promotion for Singha.  Stay tuned for a post that actually matters.

      What is it that make people tick? Why do people keep doing everyday things? I mean when you look at the big picture you see that everyone dies. Thus comes the idea "why do I try, when I'm only gonna die?" Now some would say that this idea is just ridiculous, but think about it for a minute. Of course people want to think that their own lives were meaningful and in many ways it can be. My question is what pushes people further than this concept of being content with their lives? What makes people strive to do things for others? If you look at history you might find several thousand names out of millions of people that actually made enough difference to be recognized. This fact in its self is very depressing. The chances of you making a difference in history are like a million times worse than you winning the lottery. So back to my original question. Why do people do the things they do? I mean survival is a given. Then again there are people that live on the streets and still survive. It may not be a luxurious existence, but they are living all the same. So does that mean that people do the things they do to get the things they want? That's a much better way to look at life. There are people that work hard to obtain what they want and there are those that take what they want. It's the basis of the whole criminal element. Not wanting to work for things in a way that is excepted by society. I mean being a criminal cannot be easy. The risks they face are far worse than getting laid off and not having a job. For criminals there is a lot more at stake. Yet, they still take risks and do things their way. At the same time the way in which they obtain things is shunned by the rest of society. So in a sense everyone has to fit into the views society to achieve success. People can live their lives as good as they know and have great friends, but in the end everyone still dies alone. That is what is so odd about life. No matter what you do, or who you are, the end is always the same. The moral of this post is that everyone should live their lives the best they know how and make every minute count. For eventually we all just end up as a pile of fucking dust. And even worse is that we will be forgotten and no amount of achievement will ever erase this cycle of life. Living every day like it is your last is the best idea anyone ever had because no one knows what tomorrow will bring.
