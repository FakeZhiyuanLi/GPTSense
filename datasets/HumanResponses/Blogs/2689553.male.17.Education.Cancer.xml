      Hey, this is my first post...and not my last. I've also got blogs at Xanga and over at tblog.com, so all three will probably get updated at the same time.

      Ah, there's good news tonight. The semesters over! Finally.  Strangely, I am relieved and disappointed at the same time.  Disappointed because I have lost two of my favorite classes. Relieved because this means no more photo assignments, no more working late after school for Desktop Publishing. So, its got its pros and cons, its ups and downs, but hey, Its all good. somehow I'll get along without my daily dose(s) of digital arts, which I really think is my forte.  My new classes are Mystery and Detective Literature, gym and Advanced computer applications.  I hate gym...and Advanced Computer Applications is well...probably gonna be too easy, but it was either that or sit around doing nothing for 45 minutes, but I decided I didn't need a study hall.    Some kid in school had a Hells Kitchen shirt.  I wonder where he got a shirt like that...I had no idea that the school cafeteria had a souvenir shop.  Hells Kitchen does sound like the perfect name for our cafeteria.  Lol  well, i g2g, so seeya.

      I've been sitting here in homeroom now, for like five, 10 minutes.  Not that terribly interesting.  I've had trips to the dentist less boring.  Although the announcements were okay.  Except for when the principals on.  All his announcements sound so...prefabricated, almost like a mad libs game...something like:  "Good Morning, just a few quick announcements, the first thing today is (insert announcement here).  A quick comment for (insert class here) (insert announcement here). And the big news is (insert announcement here). Thank you, have a good day.”  As you can see, this gets very mundane and boring.  But some things, you just got to live with.

      Ah....Another Friday, another week behind me, another weekend ahead of me, and another driving lesson...Err...I think.  Doesn't much matter, though.  I feel great.  You know how it is, when you're on the Price I$ Right, and the announcer guy is gonna announce the prize, and they pull back the curtain and he says, "Its..A BRAND NEW CAR!" and theres a brand new car sitting there, and the contestants all like OMIGOSH! and they keep jumping up and down, and then they do the little game thing with Bob Barker, and win the car? Nah, neither do I.       Anyway, this week my parents got me a car... That's right, A car...Do you understand, folks?!     I GOT A CAR!     Yes, That's right, I have a new car, if by new you mean a 1990 VW Jetta GL, which I quickly named Dave.  Dave the VW.  I met Dave last night, and instantly fell in love with...um...it.  Yes, its boxy, yes, its old, yes its a VW(which I am convinced stands for Very Wierd.  And GL stands for Gasoline Leech.  But, I digress.), and yes, it has very little-no intelligence or any other characteristic worthy of a name, but I still love him/it.  But then again, I've heard that even thermostats are concerned to have extremely-low levels of sentientness.  You see, all that is required for something to be considered sentient, is that it needs to be able to   Â·Number A: detect changes in the environment around it and  Â·Letter 2 adaptat to the changes     Therefore, since a thermostat:  Â·Letter 1: detects changes in the environment (in this situation, it just happens to react to heat)  Â·Numberadaptspats to the changes(in this situation it does the following: begins to heat the room, makes a little click to inform you when it comes on, and paints the room a nice paisley)  So, you see, If a thermostat is considered to be a little close to beborderlineline sentient, then Dave must be EVEN CLOSER to being borderline sentient, since he is a Very Wierd Jetta Gasoline Leech, considering he is an automatic transmission.  I am pretty sure that that fits in the category of Number A and Letter 2.  I am sure that other Very Wierd Jetta Gasolleechesechs are the same way.  Also, (in traditiontion of Dave Barry for whom the car may or may not be named) the Very Wierd Jetta Gasolleechesechs would be a good name for a rock band, or some kind of insect that lives in gas tanks.  While DrivDavedave, I noticed several minor quirks tIat i will hopefully get used to. Either thatIor i will become a Chainsaw Wielding ManiaWhichhich sounds like a good name for a rock band. ("Ladies and gentlemen, the Ephrata Area School District is proud to present the Chainsaw Wielding Maniacs!") These quirks are as follows:  Â·Quirk Number A: Dave has one of those seatbelts where the part that goes over the shouldepermenanetlyantly attached to the car.  Its not one of the kind that sits forward to the front part and then slides back when you close the door.  NO! IT DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL! So you've gotta get in, under the shoulder thing, and then therseparateerate part you have to hook with the other part.  Â·Quirk Letter 2: The radio.  Most radios, you can just turn off the car, and that cuts the radio off.  On this one,  you've got to turn the car and the radiseparatelyrately.  Don't you just LOVE the German car designers who thought it would be a good idea to wire the radio directly to the battery so that it would probably get left on and suck every ounce of life from the battery? Well, I don't. It hasn't happened yetI but i know it Iill, i will, inevitably, stop the car, get out, and leave the radio on.  AId as i do so, Dave will sit there silently like he always does, thinking about how superior he is to a thermostat, and let me walk away with the radio on.  Â·Quirk Number C: See letter 2, replace radio/radios with map light/map lights.  Â·Quirk Letter 3: The clock. Theres a clock in the instrumenThat'sel thats like 3/4 hours off, which I do not know how to set.  It has no visible means of being set, and I have no proof that it is humanly possible to be set, or that it has ever BEEN properly set.  Perhaps in the past they hadradioactivelyoactivly enhanced cockroaches (another good band name.)  Â·Quirk Number E: Theres a wierd rattling noise coming from the back seat. 'Nuff said.     As you can see, this car will take some getting used to.  I can assume that Dave and I are going to get along well.  I've already set my radio presets, and I can't wait to get my license.  Just got to remember to watch out for Gas leeches.

      Well, I had a pretty rough day on friday. New semester, new classes, whole lotta headaches. It started about, oh, about...4th period. It was government, with Mr. White. I have nothing against him, except for the offensive symbols he chose for his desktop background on his computer, but then again, it was just the Eagles. (I'm still mad at them from botching up their chances at making it to the Superbowl.) And then, he handed out the books we'd be using, and expected us to cover them with the most annoying book covers ever. I torn mine, and had to use a lot of tape. But still, it worked, which is what mattered. Then 5th period was gym. My stupid lock for my locker wasn't open. Took me half the period tryin to get it open. My gym teacher, who looks like Vin Deisel, was pissed. Then I went to the nurses office to take my carafate between gym & 6th period. And they wouldn't let me take it, because it was "too far from lunch", which really is when i'm supposed to take it, but i figured that it wouldn't matter, I could just take it while i was up there. But i couldn't. So i went to 6th period, Mystery & Detective lit, and that was ok, except the teacher was incredibly boring, she got the number of Bond movies wrong, she said there were only 4 Bonds, and she said James Bond has been out for 40 years. Actually, its 42 years. Then I had lunch, which was okay, cept some guy kept bothering me. Finally, it was 8th period, and time for Advanced Computer Applications. I couldn't find the teachers room, and she had a wierd voice which kinda got on my nerves. She's a great person, but her voiced was...eh, well. Thats about it. Gave me a headache the size of Texas, so I hoped into Dave (my red 1990 VW Jetta GL) and went for a drive. That took care of it.

      Happy Groundhog Day!  Today, as a special feature, I went out, and interviewed a groundhog.  I figured this would make a half interesting blog.  After searching for hours, I finally found what appeared to be a ground hog hole.  After sitting there for several hours, a groundhog finally poked his head out of the hole.    I quickly tackled this ground hog, and held him down.  After his initial shock, I explained what I was wanted to do.  I then proceeded to ask him a series of intense, grilling questions.  The conversation went as follows:  E (as in Eric): So, Mr. Hog, what are your feelings today?  G (as in ground hog): Well, I think that this years Groundhog Day will be most interesting.  I think I can make it without seeing my shadow.  E: That is fascinating.  What is your game plan?  G: I’m sorry, but I can’t reveal that information.  E: Oh, right, you never know when your shadows watching.  G: They can be sneaky…very sneaky.  E:  So, I suppose there really aren’t any more questions I can ask you about today, eh?  G: No, unless they have nothing to do with my shadow and me.  E: Excellent.  Then, may I ask, what is it like, being a groundhog?  G: Well, it’s actually quite interesting.  Never a dull moment, actually.  E: Hmm.  I don’t quite see.  G: Well, let me explain it to you.     At this point, the groundhog broke off into an excruciatingly loooonnnngg speech on life as a ground hog.  They actually aren’t as boring as I thought.  They have this large, secret underground city, which stretches for miles.  A whole groundhog society!  There’s Groundhog businesspersons, they have cars….And a president.       Anyway, it’s a whole groundhog utopia.  In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if, in a million years after the human race is wiped out, if groundhogs are the supreme species.  It is uncanny what the groundhogs have done.  I finished my conversation with my furry friend…  E: Wow.  That was amazing.  But sadly, I have to go.  G:  Okay, wish me luck with my shadow.  And by the way, he didn’t see his shadow.     So, by now you are wondering, ‘what, is this guy nuts??”  No, I am not, contrary to popular belief.  I am just in the holiday spirit.  How do you get in the holiday spirit?  Follow these simple steps:  Step 1: Watch Groundhog Day.  Laugh at all the frustration caused to Bill Murray by a groundhog!  If that gets you in the groundhog spirit, skip to step 3.  Otherwise, continue to two.  Step 2: Watch Caddyshack.  Laugh at all the frustration caused to Bill Murray by a groundhog…Again!  Step 3: Sing a couple of Groundhog day songs: http://ourworld.cs.com/DonaldRHalley/ghdsongs.htm  Step 4: Hug a groundhog.  Step 5: Repeat liberally.

      Im not really writing anything of value in here, just something so that I can be seen as an "active" Blogger user, so that I'll get invited to use GMail.  Hopefully, they won't read into my plan...which...wouldn't be too hard.  I just announced it.  Anyway, I suppose I should talk about something relevant.  Um...Well, its finals week, I guess.  And...um...that really sucks.  Oh, yeah, and for marching band Im gonna start playing the baritone...its kind of a small tuba.  Well, not much else to talk about...thats pretty much it.

      Im sitting here, in the band room, listening to the jazz band perform.  The wind ensemble and the percussion ensmeble have already done their thing.  Unbeknownest to me, however, until tonight, were 2 solos by Goss, our perc director, and Steph Miller, a fellow student of mine.  Although, technically it was a duet for steph, cuz Mrs. Klinger was playing as well.  Personally, I didn't like Goss's piece...it was too...random? yeah, thats the word.  It was "out there", so to speak.  One thing I really dislike about percussion ensemble, and the percussion section in band too, is that only 2 or 3 percussionists get the good parts.  Okay, well, they're all done now, so I'm outta here.

      Tonight is the last concert of the season.  And we have 74 days till band camp.  Its gonna be a looong road....i'm gonna go through so much band withdrawal it won't be funny.  Anyway, I guess i SHOULD talk about something not related to band.  Lets see...well, I'm going to the prom with Kristine Smith.  I got her corsage today.  I don't really know her that well, my friend Brenna set us up.  I called her last night, and we talked for like a half-hour. She's a really nice girl, I'll probably call her again tonight after the concert.  Finals are over, so theres a good thing.  Not much else...

      Well, last night was the prom.  Willow Valley is one of the 10 nicest places I've ever eaten in/danced in.  Of course, its probably #1 on my list of the 10 nicest places I've ever eaten in in Pennsylvania, and since I've only ever actually danced like that twice(the other being post-prom), its #1 on my list of places I've ever danced in.  The food was good, some of the best chicken breast I've ever had.   The dancing, well....I didn't dance to the fast stuff at first, cuz I'm no good at it, and I didn't want to make a fool of myself.  But I did dance with Kristine to the slower stuff.  Post-prom was fun, but got really old around 4-ish.  I put at least  like 10,000 dollars worth of prize vouchers into the bucket for the PS2 and didn't win a thing.  Gotta go now.  At least it was play money. Pictures tomorrow.
