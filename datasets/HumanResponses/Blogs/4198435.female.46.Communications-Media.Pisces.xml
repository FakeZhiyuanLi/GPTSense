      For the past week, I have been baby-sitting my two school going kids because their grandmother aka my mother-in-law had taken ill.  She has been the one who's been looking after them since they were born.  In the early days of our marriage until the two kids came along, we have been living with our in-laws. So it's natural for us to turn to them for help in looking after our children, especially when we both were at work. My husband, being the doting father that he is, is unwilling to subcome to the use of maid in our child-rearing. In any case, my in-laws were so happy to have grandsons (to carry on the lineage)that they have been very willing to do so.  After all, babies are fun to play with.  Even when I lost my job, I continue to count on her support (my father-in-law passed away 3 years ago due to colon cancer) just in case I find another job again. And of course, when I had to undergo treatment for my breast cancer, her help was imminent. I simply had no energy to take care of my children except in their homework which I continue to monitor since my husband has no patience to teach them. It helps that the school where my children go to is within my in-law's neighbourhood. In any case, the school bus refused to take my children to my house since there's no other students staying in the vicinity.  During the week, my husband will send son #1 to school for his morning session and drop off son #2 at my in-law's house where she will take care of his meals and see that he take the school bus at 12 noon. Then she will wait at the bus stop at 1pm to fetch son #1 home and see that he eat his meals. In the evening at 6.30pm, she will again wait at the bus-stop to receive son #2. My husband will go from his office to his mother's house for dinner and then picked up the kids and return to our own home. This has been the routine for almost 2 years now, since I lost my job.  But last week has been a roller-coaster kind of sorts for me. My mother-in-law caught the flu bug from my bachelor brother-in-law and has asked me not to send the kids to her lest they also catch the flu bug. Thus begin a hectic week of sending / pickup / cooking / homework routine. If all goes according to schedule, my husband will drop off son #1 in the morning on his way to work. I will cook lunch for son #2 and then send him to school, where I will wait about 45 minutes for son #1 to finish his morning session. But alas, son #1 has remedial class on Tuesday and needed to be picked up 2 hours later than usual. Then, son #2 has CCA on Thursday and needed to be in school for an hour and half somewhere in mid-morning. Ok, it's easy to adjust the timing, just more running to and fro, from home to school and vice-versa, sometimes up to 8 times a day.  But wait, since I have taken up relief teaching at my son's school, that means the to-ing and fro-ing has to be changed. WhenI was called up for relief teaching in the morning, I had to ask my maid to take charge of sending son #2 to school, which is something I'm most unwilling to do but had no choice. Yes, I don't trust my maid, even though she's very intelligent and needed little prompting or instructions to know what I want from her. I need the money, so I have no choice but to take on any relief teaching assignments when they come along, even if it means taking a risk, which I'm learning to accept.  My maid has been with me since Feb last year, brought in mainly to do the house chores when I underwent cancer treatment. I have never entrusted my sons in her care, though they are already in the age of 11 years and 10 years old. It's not that I'm afraid they will beome attached to the maid but that I won't want anything to happen to them in the event the maid decided to 'go amok' or do something that will harm them.Call me paranoid; it's the same for my husband. In those early days, he will call back everyday just to make sure the maid behave herself. We read and heard so many stories about maids abusing their little charges (of course, there are equally lots of stories about maids being abused by employers).  In yesterday Sunday Times paper, I read how some 'modern' grandparents nowadays are not so keen to help look after their grandchildren (like my in-laws) because they want the free time to do their own stuff. I think I would too, when my turn to be a granny comes. We are so used to our independence when young and even with a family, that we just won't want to be tie-down with child-caring in our senior years.After sloughing away most of our productive years, whether working to earn enough to bring up our children and looking after their needs when they were young, I should think the silver years should be a time for some relaxation and regain some of the fun we missed.  But again, looking at how I can't do away with my current help from my mother-in-law, I would, for selfish reasons want the status quo to remain for as long as possible.

      Hi Friends  Not sure if any potential employers were to read this, please, I appeal to you, do not just look at age and medical history as the criteria for employment. I have sent out so many job applications since I was terminated from my job in Aug 2002. Though there's the occassional interviews, nothing came out of it. Especially when I mentioned my breast cancer history - even though I have the doctor's certification that my cancer is in remission and I'm fit for work, I have never heard from them again.  The most recent incident is a case in point - I was called up for a second interview with the board members of a social club and I really thought I could finally see the end of my job hunting. I had actually withheld my medical history on the first interview so that I can be judged on my work experience. If there's a second interview, then I'll inform them. Sure enough, I was called up for the second interview just 2 days after. Of course, at the end of the second interview, I drop 'the bombshell'. Well, the reactions were quite re-assuring as the group of board members dismissed it as a non-issue. So when no phone calls came after 3 weeks, I know I'm doomed once again.  I don't really know what the HR people were thinking - is it because of the possibility that when the employee has a relapse that the medical expenses will be a burden to the company? or that they perceived the productivity level will not be as high as a normal healthy employee? Some friends told me that such bias or discrimination should not exist but they do.I have even discussed this with the Singapore Breast Cancer Foundation last year, when I was so frustrated with the job hunting. They told me that they have not heard of such cases nor received any feedback from its members. In any case, their mission now is to create awareness and educate older women to undertake mamogram for early detection. So my case was dismissed - just like that! What is the lesson learnt here? That a charitable organisation which is supposedly setup to provide support for breast cancer patients and survivors only choose to hear what they want to hear and do what they want to do? and I'm not sure with whose agenda are they promoting?  I desparately need an income to pay off the bank loans I took on the house and my study. I had thought if I upgrade and arm myself with a MBA that my chances of furthering my career will be better. But obviously a company that only think of their profit-line has no such compassion for long-serving employees who are also enterprising enough to pursue higher studies so as to contribute more to the organisation. What is worse is that such doings are actually the work of a minority group in the organisation who's been vested with the power to do anything they deem right - firing those that do not support them and hiring their own army of merry-men to consolidate their positions in the company. I have seen my colleagues in the previous dept completely wiped out when a new head was hired. His replacements have all worked for him in his previous organisation. My manager to whom I had to report to after the previous Director left for greener pasture, simply do not like the fact that I did nothing to enhance his ego. He find fault in everything I do even though it's done according to procedure. So he terminated my employment, even though I volunteered to be transferred to another division. Scary, isn't it?  Like my husband said, the corporate world now is different from yesteryears. So what if you have worked a long time for the company, that you have vast experiences in certain areas ... If you have no PR skills, you can't network, you can't sweet-talk your colleagues, you can't kiss-butt your superiors, you are not some sweet young thing, you just simply drown.

      First time IN  Hey, hey, hey, I just got my weblog - now I can penn down my thoughts and things that happen around me, which has been plenty over the past year or so. Those were the darkest moments of my life - I thought I would just vanish from planet earth; seriously, when I'm told that I have with breast cancer, it's like my world just crashed, the lights went out, all that I worked for in the past and all that I look forward to in my future have been totally wiped out.  I couldn't think, I couldn't eat - my mind was blank but one thing I know for sure, is that I must get rid of that lump - take it away, whatever it takes and fast. It's a crisis that only I myself have to face - no matter what other people said about being there for me, giving you encouraging words etc etc. It's a battle that I have to fight alone, and yet I have to pretend to my children that I'm strong, I'm OK....Most if not all the times, I have to go for chemotherapy treatment alone, I go for my radiography treatment alone - my husband who has to work can only fetch me to and fro - and three quarters of the time, I go home alone in a cab after treatment.  There are lots more that I want to write about, not just the pain that I endure but what happened next and how this tragedy affects my entire outlook in life, both mentally and visually.I have always wanted to write a book and hopefully this weblog is going to help me put my thoughts in order. Just having someone read my weblog is really fantastic, and of course, any views and comments are welcome.  Cheers and have a pleasant day, my friends.
