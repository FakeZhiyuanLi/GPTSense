      In the words of my generation, "Hello World". This is my first log in this BLOG. I think it is only apt for me to explain what the hell a BLOG is, for the benefit of the those who might be scratching their head everytime they hear that word. A BLOG is a slang for Weblog. It's kinda like an online journal. The first thing that it reminded me was Doogie Howser MD. In my opinion expressing one's self is a healthy routine. Specially for the depressed, the stressed, the people who just like to speak in the third person point of view.  After surfing for the whole day in the office, I finally found something worthwhile to do. I'll be updating this BLOG as often as I can. So if you are interested in me, or in my mishaps, visit it every once in a while. I look forward to my next log. Ciao.

      Someone once told me that the time you really miss someone is when that person is right there in front of you. I find it to be quite ironic and disturbingly true altogether. Perhaps what they are referring to is a yearning for someone else. A side or a psyche of the person they are with. Or worse, they fear that the effects of being in such close proximity with someone they hold so dear is about to end. And so they anticipate the inevitable aftermath.  I came to realize that when you say I miss you to someone, what you are actually saying is I don’t want you to go. Or I want you to stay. Or I don’t want this to end. Funny isn’t it? How people can’t say directly what is aching in their hearts. I, among many people have the knack of making simple things complicated. I now find myself asking questions. What if, tomorrow becomes next week? And Next week becomes next month? And next month becomes forever? Will I ever find the answers I seek? As always I find the answers emotionally disturbing.  Exactly how long has it been since I was last with her? Twelve days 2 hours 4 seconds and 2 heartbeats have passed. As I am writing this entry, I am comforted that the long wait is finally over. I no longer care about the past. And tomorrow doesn’t seem as important than today. There is only now. And so now I yearn.

      If there has been anything new this week, it's that I've been silent in the past few days. I guess I went overboard going senti mode during the last few days. Sometimes, in our attempt to make the people around us feel special we fail to consider what matters most. As said in the "Little Prince", what is essential is invisble to the naked eye. This week I lost track of what was essential. And it has changed my life forever.   I now try to be more sensitive on the little things. For sometimes they are more significant than what we perceive to be of importance. Because of my failure, I seek refuge in the silence of my solitude. Here I lay and reflect on what I have missed, on what I have done. And I am comforted by the peace of silence. Sometimes you need to be alone to realize these things. Because in acknowledging your failures you come about to the conclusion that you are responsible for the things you do. You were a part of the failure. There was something that you could have done. Ergo you are still in control of your life. And you live with the promise that you still have the chance to fix the mistakes you have made.  My friends have been telling me that I am too quiet in my approach in a lot of things. They say that it is not good. I will appear weak and people will try to dominate me. I will be unable to impress people if I sulk in silence. In my defense, why ruin silence? When silence is the language I use to express how I feel. I can get rowdy sometimes. I can be loud if i want to be, specially when I am mad. But it is when I am silent when I savor every moment that passes by. It is in silence where I thank God for the chance and when I pray for the moment never to end.  Enough about the my melodramatic sentimental babbling. I have posted several new mp3's in the yahoo briefcase. This time Maureen is the one who is singing. It's a lot cleaner and smooth. Perfect for this weeks entry. But it also means that the songs are more simple and others may say bland. You may say that it's also no good. But it was hard for me to set it up so backoff.. Hehehehehe. I do appreciate the posts from friends who drop by and make entries in the tag board. For requests, inquiries and complaints just make your mark on the tag board on the right side of this page. I'd like to dedicate the last song i uploaded to 2 people. To Abbie, mau's best friend and to ate shawie who is going to be celebrating her birthday soon. The title of the song is "One of these days" by michelle branch. Cheers!

      They say that year 25 in a person's life is a huge milestone worth of commemoration. I dont get it. What's the hype about being 25. Do I have a car, no. Do I have live on my own, hell no. Am I in a relationship, dont say bad words. Hehehehehe.  They say that the rest of the populace start stopping counting birthdays at age 25. I can remember the cake prepared by my officemates this morning. They just had 1 candle. They say that after 25, you start using only one candle in your birthday cake. Otherwise the neighbors might think there's fire in your house because of the number of candles in your cake if you have one for each year that has passed.   While the rest of the world is asking themselves about success and career at this point in their life. Im gratefull to have reached this age. I look back and just laugh at all my failures and awkward experiences. I have grown. I think what's more significant was God has given me a chance to grow. 25 years of it. And so I move on. Living life without regrets.  For our webcast fans check our yahoo briefcase account. I have uploaded new mp3's. A cleaner version of my Immortal, Officially Missing you(with the twins haplessly trying to do a duet) and You First Believed. Enjoy.

         Good day friend. As promised I am haplessly trying to keep this weblog as updated as possible. Though there is not much to say about the days that has passed by, there has been a lot of development.  For quite sometime now, I've been seriously contemplating in making crucial decisions in my career. New ventures, possibilities and challenges. Im kinda takin it easy in the last few months.         Specially that I've already started going to graduate school, things are not looking financially stable for me. It's a good thing I have great friends and a loving family who supported me in this endeavor.          I have also been trying to get to know this special someone. And I have no idea where I stand as far chances are concerned. So far the approach has been to be more relaxed, carefree and non idealistic. I have realized that in my past approaches in courting, I have often imprisoned myself in the cages of ideals and fantasies. I guess, I wasnt myself. I dont plan, I improvise. Hehehehe. So far it doesnt look good for me. It seems that Im not the only one who has been wooed by the goddess who has been driving me mad these past few days.      As promised to our webcast acoustic fans I am posting here some URL's for our mp3's. For now , all I have are some jamming sessions. I'll be updating the links later, to have a more decent recording. But for now, I guess this will have to do. A picture of things to come. Go to  urlLink yahoo briefcase  . Login as "next_of_kin2000" with password "fetalvero". Click on My Documents link to download the mp3's available.        As you can see I've been very busy in the past few days. Too many risks, choices, and things to be done. I figured, if I dont start trying I'll never get anywhere. If I dont make decisions, take risks and learn from them, i'll never find out. If I have a future else where, if I can survive graduate school, if me and my sisters can excel as a band and if she's the one. So I guess this week I'll be trying.

      Someone once noticed that I had new  shoes. Contrary to popular belief, I wear my shoes not to drive away fashion savvy and interesting people. I am very sentimental about these things. Most of my shoes were given to me by my dad.  It's a link between me and him . We dont get to talk a lot. But as far as I can remember he has always been giving me shoes since I was a kid. So it reminds me of my dad. The lessons he has taught me. What he has done for me and my family. Often times I look down. Specially when I have failed.When I am tired and weary. And I see my shoes. I am reminded by the places I've been. The things I have done. And the people who care and believe in me. It's funny how small things such as this can brighten up one's day.

      This week melvin reflects on things he actually said(or at least he thought he said):  "I'd rather go and lookback, than to stay and watch you walk away."  "Ahhh to love! Tis trading one pain for another"  "There are doctors for these kinds of things!!"  "There came a time in my life, when someone took my idea of the perfect girl, destroyed it, and replaced it with her picture."  "I am not sensitive. Im just very sentimental."  "I dont like her! I love her! There's a difference.  It just so happened that I cant post anything worth seriously contemplating during the weekdays. But the blog page was calling me. Must write something. Until my next entry. Ciao.

      So I find my back against the wall. I’m getting more paranoid everyday. I don’t know what’s worse, knowing too much or not knowing anything at all. Many times I have found things not going in my favor. Failures, mistakes seem to be a common thing to me now. And yet I can’t help but feel upset whenever things don’t work out for me.  A friend once told me, in life we have been pre programmed with the idea that with every action comes an equal reaction. Causality suggests that for everything you do there is an equivalent result. And so we go to school with the idea that if we graduate, we have a better chance on landing on a good job. We work, knowing that if we do our job well we’ll make a living or get a raise. But not everything in life has to be like that. In fact, the most essential concept in life does not adhere to the rule of causality. And so we see many people struggling with it. Love, does not follow the rules of action and reaction. At least not strictly. When you love someone, there is no guarantee that you will be loved in return.  When you court someone, it does not endow the person you are courting to respond to your actions. So when you are looking for results, for responses and for reasons, don’t look for it in love. Least you’ll find the understanding it as a very daunting task. For people who get by, they immediately try to accept that Love is something that you cannot understand. It is beyond you and me. It does not conform to any norms or rules. In short do not waste your time trying to understand something that can never be understood.   And so I ask myself why invest my feelings on something that is not certain? Something that I cannot fathom or understand. The answer is simple. I do so because of hope. In life as well as in love, nothing is for certain. There is no assurance that everything will run smooth as planned. Things can go wrong. People get hurt. But it is hope that shall see you through all these trials. “It is hope that drives me through the day, and more importantly hope that sees me through the night. It is through hope, that love shall lead me back to you.”.
