      Well, its me back again from San Francisco. A lot happened there, not a lot of big things but a lot. So the last day of school, i got A's on both of my finals and we got our grades, an A too, second highest in the class, my brother is first highest. Another thing: We were the only two to get A's in the class. And you wondered why i couldnt update! So..it was really sad leaving and i have pictures on my website now! I know! i konw it seems like forever! But the thing is...i love these pictures and there in perfect organization. Links and everything. Much love to Zack and to Sarah, and to Mr. Parrot and to Alex and Chi Chi and Yue-Cheng, and Paige...we all love you doll! So...anyways we went to San Francisco where they (the dentists) became happy with sticking very scary sharp objects in my mouth and things that were really loud. I really didnt like it and i kept thinking i was going to faint. I just get like that. So then after that we went to our house in Daly City, all peachy. And then the house in San Francisco...very nice little (NOT!) house there. The renters are keeping it nice. Then t buy groceries where last time i went with my dad we saw this guy that played on the Kings basket ball...could get his Autograph though...Grrr : (. Anyways...then we got our haircut! You would love my hair...its so tiny and with my glasses i look like a freaking genius!!! Anywhoo! So...then we went and ate and this is the funny part. I was totally bored...stuffed to the brim about to fall asleep and this guy comes in with this other guy... I dont know, friends or something....so then what happened is that i went to go use the restroom it was a two hour drive back home. So...i went and when i came back i stared at the guy. He had a freaking bible with him and he had glassed that were plastic like mine. So i stared at him and i guess he thought i thought he was hot, which he SO was not. So anyways...he stared at me and smiled and said something. I didnt understand so i just kinda smiled at him. I sat down and then i realized he had said "Hey precious." Freaky deaky. I walked out of the resteraunt with my mom cause my dad was eating fish and that takes forever in a day. So...then what happened was my mom and i were about to cross the street when these gang bangers go by and they throw a glass bottle on the floor. It exlodes and i kinda take a step back. What idiots. Oh yeah, earlier i had seen this hobo women with a REAL Louis Vuitton bag, i personally thought it was hillarious. Cause she goes around with like dirty pants begging for money and she looks like she gonna die and in her hand a huge ass Louis Vuitton bag that costs more than she will ever have...she was holding it like it was her life. So..today i woke up with a fat headache, rememberd i was going Sushi-ing with Alexandra and Poof there goes my headache! So...we went to Sushi...i ate WAY to much. So much i thought i was gonna puke afterward. And the fact that we went out after for a cup of coffee that wasnt really a cup cause it was a venti white chocolate mocha from starbucks ( i cant believe i tossed it!!!) made me nearly gag. So...with the coffee in hand, cool haircut, neat glasses, loose faded jeans, carefree walk and black UCD sweater....we entered this hip little music store and sat down to listen to music, we were some fly little crackers! i felt totally sophisticated until i thought i was gonna puke. All the raw fish got to me. Oh yeah, huh! We went to Maren's mom store...a little funky. There was this TINY purse smaller than my palm and it had 20 on it. I went up to buy it...i mean tiny little purse made out fake leather...come one. twenty cents right? It was fity percent off. Of from 40 cents. I go up with my dollar...guess what? Its twenty bucks cause its "From Italy" Shoot man...i can kill me a cow in italy, make crappy purses, dye them, ship them over to the US and sell em for over a hundred bucks. These people are f-ing CRAZY! Not to mention they have a door smack in the middle of the damn store cause it shows off the too expensive hangers. Ridiculous. So...then after the music store, we went to the Salvation army...it was really cool. Even though it stunk so bad...there was some really good books. Then we went to go watch The Village. The movie...its not that bad, but if youre looking to get scared...dont go watch it. So anyways..after that...we went to Gap and we tried on some skirts and some pants and i found these pants...low on the waist cropped pants. THEYRE MINE! fifty bucks and this cute little hat and scarf...my birthdays coming up...*clears throat* Mommy, daddy? Wanna add that to the one hundred shopping spree at Pac Sun and the brand new dell labtop? Please...so anyways then we went to borders and we read some and then i came back home plopped down and watched Starsky and Hutch...hillarious and then im going downstairs to finish off the night with The Godfather one...i think i know my daddys new birthday gift... the godfather. Why are all guys obsessed with that damn movie anyways? So...heres to me and my two and half weeks of summer!!! You all know you love me!

      Well, today is done meaning only one more day of school which is a total blast for me! I cant wait till its done except for the fact that then i wont be able to see those people again which makes me really sad! I really love these people! All of them...okay minus one or two or three or four or five or six...you get my point. Anyways Zack is getting nicer and sweeter and more into my personal bubble space. Alex is being a dumb ass he likes to take and touch people. He enjoys coming up to you and touching you. Touching your hair and your hands and your face and anything on your face and other things. he enjoys to take your things. Pencils, erasers, journals, books. Freaky huh? Well bryant didnt make it. He went to UCD Library, or he went to the MU. And he stood there and stayed there i suppose for too long. Like he left or something. I feel really bad i kinda didnt want to hop on the bus. He is all by himself over there....i feel awful! Anyways...tomorrow there is another final. Today there was a final, it was kinda sad though. Because you know what? There were only three questions on the test. The test was worth a hundred points, and talk about disaster if you missed one of the questions...!! Ouch! Anyways...tomorrow another final. I have a damn 88% in the stupid class. Im doing ec today...and a kick ass job in the test tomorrow. I mean hey, last time i came out with a 100% on the midterm. Who says i cant pull it off again? Zack was being awfully funny today. He stole my cell phone several times and then he sat on me and he yelled at two people who were making out to get a room...lol. What a doll! Anyways, i must go! Wish me Luck!

      Dont we all love Barbie? Yeah...id say. Id write a lot except for the fact that i already wrote a lot but deleted most of it. Actually all of it. i think that being a webdesigner has gotten to my head. Anyways i am free in two days. So this freaky deaky mexican girl asked my brother to go with him. Well not go with him, like she wrote a note to stephanie her mexican friend and in it she said that she wanted to go with bryant...like date him. Freaky huh? It scares me to think that she wants to go with bryant. Which brought me to think...if my dad thought it was cute and funny that she wanted to go with bryant...what would he think about me? So i told him and then he stayed quiet and he said "What?" and then i started laughing and said just joking! Isnt that so unfair? my parents said that they would kill the guy who would want to date me! Lol, i find that kinda funny. SO i talked to paige today, shes a real doll! Lol, no pun intended! She is really sweet and not all that pretty but she has a face that you have to look twice at. like literally. She is just...so interesting. I love it. So anyways, the doll (lol) started to talk to me about highschool and stuff and how great it was and how i should take this class and that class and this and that. I loved it! No one except for her barbie guards can talk to her. I loved it! She was awfully nice until Zack started to bug her! Isnt Zack so cute! Anyways...it turns out that she is mexican and that she speaks spanish fluently. Yeah..thats right. She understands everything that we say! Uh-Oh! Anyways...people think that im half chinese. Im sorry but these people are just screwed up! I cant believe them...me chinese? They have the weirdest impression of asian people. They probably thought i was asian cause i was on top of everything...like knowing all the answers...thats how asians are. Always the best...its the truth, i know tons of people who want to break that style. But no...not me im not asian. Im full bred italian and spanish. You know you love me though!

      Its so lovely to be one with the computer! its even better knowing that i will be able to go on the computer for the rest of my life and that in just three days i wil be able to go and work on my website. So, today Zach and i got to giggling like crazy. The father figure was upset with us. He was really clingy though and we were cracking up about capitol barbie. The truth of the matter is. That i see so much of her in me. Or me in her. Something  like that. I just see so much becuase you know what? the truth is that if i were in her position i would act like her. I talked to her with bryant today. Shes okay, tells the truth. She got three percent higher than i did on the test. Its okay, i wont kill her for it. I still love her like crazy. lol. Well anyways, i really should be going, working on homework. Schools almost out so that means new layout! Isnst that nifty? Anyways...new layout most probably. But without paintbrushes...im ultimetly nothing! (Spelling) Love you mucha!

Really sad, i know...im actually really depressed...i wish that i could be back at summer school with all my friends...i really miss them all. I mean it would be nice to get in a get together again..im listening to Faith Hill, "Breathe" Exciting stuff huh? I love Davis and all, but it has NOTHING on San Francisco...i wish i were in San Francisco. I love San Francisco, its all i have. Its the only thing that i know that i can hold onto it. And then ofcourse some damn terrorists will come and blow it all up. I have to go...i dont really want to write right now...im probably gonna go finsish a layout i started and never finished. Okay then...and then code dolls again...i miss all my friends so much! I want jo and kristin back and zack and jennifer...i dunno.
