      Just got back from Chicago.  Good times.  There's a blue moon tonight.  Not much else to say.  I saw an awesome play Weddings of Mass Destruction and an awesome movie Napoleon Dynamite.  I only got into two fights with the fam.   Good for me.

      Marilyn needs to fuck off.&nbsp; If you need to insult people, you probably have some insecurity issues to deal with.&nbsp; I believe everyone's mother said it best, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything."&nbsp; Listen to your mother.

      I'll probably just watch some movies today.  Some people are so god damn rude.  I am not feeling well.  Friend count: 0.  Beggars can't be choosers and the picky don't beg.  What now?  I give up.  I'm only upset because I care that people take no interest in me.  If I chose to not care about people at all, then I'll have nothing to be upset over.

      Finally my mom is back at work.  She had the weekend off and was driving me up a wall.  She is so dumb sometimes.  Oh well.  Finally the phone rings.  Yeah, I've been having dreams about burying dead people and stuff.  Nice.

      Nobody's called me today as usual.  I'm in pain and alone.  Last summer felt so much better.  Hell, I was in love.  Even though he just wanted to be friends and we're friends now, I miss the feeling of being completely enamored with someone for no good reason.  I have this complex that I think is the result of an absent father.  I have this constant need for male acceptance and I have none.  There is literally one male that isn't freaked out by me.  I don't know what my problem is.  Nobody wants to listen to me.  I keep getting bitched out by people.  They act like I'm superficial and my biggest problem is that I don't have a boyfriend.  Well, if they don't want to listen to my small problems, then what makes them think that I'd share my big problems with them.  Jesus, everyone acts like their life is so much worse than mine and makes me listen to their whining.  They refuse to listen to me without mocking me.  I'm sick of this bullshit.  Selfish bastards.

      I'm going off of some of my anti-depressants that never worked. Guess what? There is still some junk left over from the Effexor in my kidneys. The withdrawal is causing weakness, dizzyness, insomnia, nausia, and hell. I need to detox. No more epsom salts! This is not a fun time, and I still do not trust doctors. Nobody warned me that stopping this drug would make me bed ridden.

      I couldn't sleep last night so I stayed up until 7 A.M. sketching.  Good times.  I learned that I can't draw under sleep deprovation.

      Stone's Throw was awesome.  Silvering rocked the house.  Way too many people I know are at the mall.  Crazy.  Sitting around and telling scary stories is the best.  The Chupacabra is coming for my goat.

      Started driver's ed today. Waste of my time. Haven't talked to any of my friends in like two weeks.  Do mimes talk when they're off duty?
