       ¿Recuerdan, ustedes que se jactan de haber experimentado todo lo posible , haber presenciado una situación tan insólita y extraña como la actual ? . Arbitraria e incierta coyuntura que nos demuestra una vez mas los límites del entendimiento humano, la enorme creatividad del caos , anomia sin orden o concierto. Nos tocó  vivir en el pasado situaciones extremas, ver con nuestro propio ojo el desarrollo de las más exóticas experiencias económicas y , orgullosos llegamos a pensar que lo habiamos conocido todo. ¿Qué nos puede ya asombrar, dijeron y proclamaron  muchos llenando con desafiante hybris su pequeño espiritu, a nosotros que ya conocemos la estructura del tejido de Ananke?

       Trade Deficit, Wholesale Prices Increase Fri Aug 13, 5:55 PM ET By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON -     The U.S. trade deficit hit a record $55.82 billion in June as the country's foreign oil bill surged to an all-time high, the government reported Friday. Soaring energy costs also showed up in wholesale prices for July, although a big drop in food costs helped keep the overall increase in the Labor Department ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites )'s Producer Price Index ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) down to a modest 0.1 percent. While food costs fell by 1.6 percent in July, the biggest one-month decline in more than two years, energy prices shot up by 2.3 percent, the biggest gain in six months. The Commerce Department ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites )'s monthly trade report showed the June imbalance was up a sharp 19.1 percent from a revised May imbalance of $46.88 billion. Exports of goods and services fell by 4.3 percent to $92.82 billion while imports climbed 3.3 percent to a record $148.64 billion. The far bigger-than-expected jump in the deficit caught analysts by surprise. They said it would act to further slow an economy already struggling with what Federal Reserve ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) Chairman Alan Greenspan ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) described as a "soft patch" in the early summer. "America is bleeding badly in the trade area," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. "This implies not only weaker economic growth but a weaker dollar, which will contribute to inflation down the road." Economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, slowed sharply in the April-June quarter to an annual rate of just 3 percent, down from 4.5 percent in the first quarter. Economists said June's huge widening of the trade gap would force the government to lower the second quarter GDP ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) figure to an even weaker 2.5 percent. They also said the record highs for oil prices, which topped $45 per barrel this week, would make them trim their forecasts for growth in the second half of this year. Many said second-half growth probably would come in at 3.5 percent to 4 percent. Wall Street ended a rough week with a small gain even as investors continued to worry about the relentless rise in oil prices, which set a new record on Friday, closing at $46.58 per barrel, up $1.08 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 10.76 points to finish the week at 9,825.35. "The drag we are getting from trade plus the big bite higher oil prices take out of purchasing power will translate into weaker growth," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. The surge in the foreign energy bill was the biggest factor in June's trade deterioration. Energy imports climbed to a record $15.30 billion, up 17.8 percent from May. The country's trade deficit with China climbed to a record $14.2 billion, up 17 percent from May, while the imbalance with Japan rose to $6.3 billion and the imbalance with the expanded 25-nation European Union ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) to $10.6 billion. The Bush administration blamed the weakness on a global economic slowdown. "Growth in the rest of the world appears to be slowing," Treasury Secretary John Snow told reporters after an appearance in Boca Raton, Fla. But the campaign of Bush's Democratic rival, Sen. John Kerry ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ), said the soaring trade deficit was an indictment of the current administration's trade policies, which it blames for the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs over the past three years. "This administration hasn't come close to doing enough to enforce trade agreements and fight for jobs here at home," said Kerry spokesman Phil Singer. Kerry has promised that as president he would end a tax break that allows corporations to defer payment of taxes on overseas earnings and would review trade agreements to ensure they contain enforceable protections for worker rights and the environment in the trading partner countries. Last month's small 0.1 percent increase in wholesale prices followed a 0.3 percent decline in June as price pressures moderated at the wholesale level after sizable gains early in the year. With crude oil prices hitting record levels again, however, analysts are predicting that prices of gasoline and other energy products will be headed higher in coming months. Trying to make sure that inflation does not become a problem, the Federal Reserve raised a main short-term interest rate by a quarter point on Tuesday, its second rate increase this year. Fed officials signaled that further increases would occur at a measured pace, which economists have read as an indication that the Fed will make quarter-point moves at its final three meetings of the year in September, November and December. Outside of the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core wholesale inflation was up a modest 0.1 percent in July following a 0.2 percent June gain. Robert Dederick, head of RGD Economics, a Chicago consulting firm, said that performance would reassure the Fed that inflation outside of energy still is contained. ___ On the Net: International trade:  urlLink http://www.economicindicators.gov/  Wholesale prices:  urlLink http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm

       Ants Form Supercolony Spanning 60 Miles   By Associated Press,    August 12, 2004 , MELBOURNE, Australia  --    Normally clannish and agressive Argentine ants have become so laid back since arriving in Australia decades ago that they no longer fight neighboring nests and have formed a supercolony here that spans 60 miles, scientists say. The huge colony stretches under the southern Australian city of Melbourne. Argentine ants are not harmful to humans, but have been known to displace native plants and animals. "In Argentina, their native homeland, ant colonies span tens of meters, are genetically diverse and highly aggressive towards one another," Monash University researcher Elissa Suhr said in a statement this week. "So, population numbers never explode and they are no threat to other plants and animals." However, Suhr said the genetic structure of Argentine ants here has changed since they first arrived in 1939, making them less aggressive and more likely to mate with ants from neighboring nests. "Now they're uncolonial ... and the ants from different nests are not aggressive towards one another. So that enables them to grow into an absolutely enormous colony that covers the whole city," Suhr told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio late Wednesday. Suhr said the Argentine ants could even displace native species by taking over local habitats and preying on insects commonly eaten by Australian ants. Australia is not the only country to be invaded by the Argentine ants, Suhr said. "In California, they have displaced native ants, decreased the diversity of other native insects, affected the dispersal of seeds and even decreased lizard numbers," she said.

        US Trade Deficit Explodes - Worst In Five Years   WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US trade gap exploded to a record 55.8 billion dollars in June, the sharpest deterioration in more than five years, the government said.   The shortfall mushroomed 19.1 percent, the biggest one-month rise since February 1999, to a seasonally adjusted 55.8 billion dollars, the Commerce Department said.   The trade gap shattered the previous record deficit in April of 48.2 billion dollars, and appeared to put the country on the path to an unprecedented annual deficit.   "The trade deficit soared to simply incomprehensible heights in June," said Naroff Economic Advisors president Joel Naroff.   "If we believe the Commerce Department, the trade deficit is running well above 600 billion dollars on an annualized basis," he said. The shortfall was "so far off the radar screen that it constitutes a sneak attack."   Naroff questioned the data.   "What, did foreigners go on strike and decide they didnt want to buy US goods anymore? Did the economies around the world suddenly collapse?" he asked.   Exports crumbled 4.2 billion dollars, or 4.3 percent, to 92.8 billion dollars, the steepest decline since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Commerce Department said.   Foreign demand weakened for US-made capital goods, industrial supplies, foods, motor vehicles and consumer goods.   "It is just a phenomenal deterioration for one month in the trade balance," said BMO Financial Group senior economist Sal Guatieri. "There was broad-based weakness in export growth, which is a little disconcerting because it could mean that because of higher energy costs the global economy has softened a little," Guatieri said.   Imports, however, climbed 4.7 billion dollars, or 3.3 percent, to 148.6 billion dollars.   Americans snapped up foreign-made industrial supplies, capital goods and consumer items, showing strong underlying US domestic demand, especially among businesses, he said.   The dollar slumped on the news, tumbling to 110.605 yen from 111.715 just before the release. The euro took immediate advantage, rising to 1.2331 dollars from 1.2224.   Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry 's campaign seized on the data as a sign of economic mismanagement by President George W. Bush , who faces an election November 2.   "In the face of yet another report indicating a record trade deficit, the evidence is building that this administration hasnt come close to doing enough to enforce trade agreements and fight for jobs here at home," Kerry spokesman Phil Singer said in a statement.   A breakdown of the raw trade figures showed:   -- The deficit with China expanded 17 percent from the previous month to a record 14.2 billion dollars.   -- The US deficit with Japan widened 14 percent to 6.3 billion dollars.   -- With the European Union , the trade gap grew 35 percent to 10.6 billion dollars.   -- The deficit with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC ) grew 10 percent to a record 6.2 billion dollars.   The US deficit could force the government to downgrade its initial estimate of 3.0 percent economic growth in the second quarter of the year, Guatieri said.   But the news was unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve from a program of raising the short-term interest rate, he said.   On Tuesday, policymakers raised the federal funds target rate, which banks charge each other overnight, to 1.5 percent from 1.25 percent in a gradual effort to end the lowest rates in nearly 50 years.   "Outside employment, most numbers for July have suggested a fairly good bounce back in activity and that suggests the Fed will continue extending the tightening cycle in September," Guatieri said.   A separate report provided further comfort to the Federal Reserve, indicating price pressures may be easing.   Producer prices -- a measure of inflation at the wholesale level -- gained 0.1 percent in the month to July, and were up 4.0 over the past year, the Labor Department said.

       Hurricane Charley Pounds Florida Storm Rated a Category 4 With 145 MPH Winds By Jill Barton and Allen G. Breed   The Associated Press   Friday, August 13, 2004    A stronger-than-expected Hurricane Charley roared ashore Friday as a dangerous Category 4 storm, slamming the heavily populated Gulf Coast with devastating storm surges and 145 mph wind that snapped trees in half, ripped roofs off buildings and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people. The hurricane struck west-central Florida at Charlotte Harbor with a wicked combination of water and wind. A surge of sea water reached up to 15 feet high, the National Hurricane Center said. Winds blew off the roof of a hurricane shelter where 1,200 people had gathered and tore apart small planes at the Charlotte County airport. Two traffic deaths were reported in Florida. Earlier, Charley had been blamed for three deaths in Cuba and one in Jamaica. Gov. Jeb Bush said damage could exceed $15 billion but cautioned it was a preliminary estimate as the storm headed across the center of Florida toward the Orlando area. President Bush declared the storm-battered region a federal disaster area. "Our prayers are with you and your families tonight," the president said in Seattle." "This is the nightmare scenario that we've been talking about for years," hurricane center director Max Mayfield said of storm surges that ranged from 10 to 15 feet. Charley's eye reached land at 3:45 p.m. EDT when it passed over the barrier islands between Fort Myers and Punta Gorda, some 70 miles southeast of the Tampa Bay area. It struck the mainland 30 minutes later. "Happy Friday the 13th," said Don Paterson of Punta Gorda, who tried to ride out the storm at his mobile home but got beaned by a flying microwave oven as his home was demolished. His refrigerator fell on him, and he spent the rest of the storm sheltering behind a lawnmower. As an airplane hangar at the Charlotte County airport flew apart around him and his wife, "it sounded like a calypso band gone crazy," said Jim Morgan. "There was crap flying around there -- It looked like the inside of a blender," said Morgan, 66. "If you want to meet your maker, I got close on that round." In Arcadia, 20 miles inland, one wall collapsed at a civic center serving as a shelter for 1,200 people. Only one person was hurt, and her injuries were minor. The wall "started peeling back," said Alida Dejongh. "It lifted and you could just see more and more light. You could hear this popping and zipping noise like a giant Ziploc bag." At 7 p.m., the center of the hurricane was 65 miles south-southwest of Orlando, moving north-northeast near 25 mph and gaining speed. Maximum sustained winds had decreased to near 115 mph with higher gusts, with further weakening expected. Charley was forecast to strike the Daytona Beach area before reaching the Atlantic Ocean, where it could regain strength. Rain totaling 4 to 8 inches was expected along Charley's path, creating the risk of flash flooding. Tornado watches were issued for a wide swath of southwestern and central Florida. Small tornadoes associated with the hurricane were reported in Osceola County southwest of Orlando and Highlands County northwest of Lake Okeechobee, with no damage reported. Flights were halted at Orlando International Airport. Orlando theme parks, including Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando, had closed by early afternoon and Disney's Animal Kingdom did not open at all. The only previous time that the parks closed for a hurricane was in 1999 for Floyd. Guests remaining at hotels were urged to stay in their rooms. On the state's Atlantic coast, 10 Navy ships from Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville were sent out to sea, the Navy said Friday. At Cape Canaveral, traffic was bumper-to-bumper at noon as Kennedy Space Center employees left work early. All but a skeleton crew of 200 of the center's nearly 13,000-person work force was sent home, or told to stay home, and the space shuttle hangars and the massive Vehicle Assembly Building were sealed tight. About 340,000 homes and businesses were without power in southwest Florida, said Kathy Scott, spokeswoman with Florida Power &amp; Light. That number was expected to grow as Charley cut across the state. The hurricane was initially expected to strike as a Category 2 storm, with sustained wind of 96 mph to 110 mph. But it strengthened rapidly as it swung across the Gulf of Mexico toward the Florida coast, largely sparing the Key West area, and was upgraded to Category 4, a storm capable of extreme damage with sustained wind of 131 mph to 155 mph. The storm was almost on par with Hurricane Andrew, which smashed into South Florida in 1992 with 165 mph wind, killed 43 people and caused $31 billion in damage. It even affected the nerve center of the war in Iraq, MacDill Air Force Base, where residents evacuated and only essential personnel remained. Amtrak canceled long-distance service between Miami and New York for Saturday, and trains coming from Los Angeles were stopping at New Orleans instead of continuing on to Orlando. Charley was the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since the Category 5 Andrew hit south of Miami in 1992. Hurricane Mitch, which stalled over Honduras in 1998, also was Category 5 with sustained wind over 155 mph. Mitch killed some 10,000 people in Central America. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency and ordered residents and vacationers in two coastal counties to evacuate. State troopers immediately started redirecting traffic on the main highway leading away from Myrtle Beach.

       China able to handle oil's jump Cheap labor allows nation to absorb cost   By STEPHANIE HOOAssociated Press BEIJING -    Although China is now the world's No. 3 oil importer, depending on foreign fuel to run its booming factories, the country's consumption remains strong even with crude surpassing $45 a barrel. Neighboring South Korea is struggling to cope with oil's rising price, but in China, labor is so cheap that businesses can handle higher energy costs, analysts say. "China's overall demand for oil is still increasing. It is only a matter of how fast the demand will grow in the future," said Zhou Fengqi, at the government's National Development Reform Commission. China's oil consumption jumped 11.5 percent last year to 6 million barrels a day, with 2.5 million of them imported, according to figures from the British oil company BP. The International Energy Agency says the growth in China's oil consumption, which hit a 25 percent annual rate for the second quarter, is expected to slow in the third quarter but will still be an impressive 9 percent. China is responsible for a third of the growth in global oil demand, according to the Paris-based IEA. But the biggest factors in the current price surge are OPEC's tight supply policy and Middle East turmoil, said Adrian Loh, an energy analyst at Merrill Lynch in Singapore. China's economic growth has shown signs of slowing recently, from a searing pace of 9 percent a year toward the official target for 2004 of a still robust 7 percent. But the easing is unrelated to oil prices; it's being guided by Chinese leaders who are trying to slow the fast growth, worried that the country could be left with unneeded factories and its banks burdened with unpaid loans. The impact of higher oil prices on other Asian countries is mixed. Japan has made energy-efficiency a priority, minimizing its vulnerability to swings in world markets since suffering through the oil price shock of the 1970s. The price increases might even pay off for some Japanese companies that could see demand rise for technology such as Honda's and Toyota's hybrid gas-electric cars. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries won a government prize for a technology called "turbo chiller," which cuts power use for air conditioners by up to 45 percent.

       Trade Gap at Record, Producer Prices Tame By Tim Ahmann WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     The U.S. trade deficit widened much more than expected in June, hitting a record $55.8 billion on the biggest drop in exports in nearly three years and record imports, the government said on Friday.  urlLink   Separate reports showed producer prices largely under wraps last month and consumer sentiment eroding in August. Wall Street economists had expected the trade gap to grow, but looked for a deficit of just $47 billion. Instead it jumped 19 percent, the biggest increase in more than five years. Analysts said the unexpectedly large gap will lead the government to lower its reading of second-quarter economic growth, which it had put at a 3 percent annual rate in a snapshot late last month. Before Friday, economists had been thinking the GDP ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) figure would actually be bumped up. "It's extraordinary, I've never seen this big a swing in one month," Kevin Logan, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York, said of the worsening trade picture. The Bush administration said the widening gap reflected weak growth overseas, while Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites )'s campaign faulted Bush for failing to vigorously enforce trade agreements. The dollar fell and U.S. bond prices rose as traders read the economic tea leaves as signaling a slower pace of Federal Reserve ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) interest-rate rises than had been expected. Stocks, which closed at year lows on Thursday, managed to edge higher, with the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average closing up 10 points at 9,825. "The weakness in exports and a decline in confidence raise yellow flags about the performance of the economy," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management in St. Louis. On the bright side, she said, rising imports suggested U.S. consumers and businesses were still shopping. SOURING ON THE FUTURE The Labor Department ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) said the producer price index, which gauges prices received by farms, factories and refineries, rose 0.1 percent last month, after a 0.3 percent fall in June. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent gain. Energy prices jumped 2.3 percent, but that was largely offset by a 1.6 percent plunge in food costs. Core producer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, gained a slim 0.1 percent, as expected. Economists said the price report suggested inflation at the wholesale level was under wraps, although some expressed concern that rising prices further back in the production pipeline could spell trouble down the road. The biggest sore spot in the U.S. price picture has been oil. U.S. crude prices hit yet another record high on Friday, settling at $46.58 a barrel after an explosion and fire at an Indiana refinery. The recent run-up in oil prices showed through in all three economic reports on Friday, helping stoke June's record imports, putting upward pressure on producer prices and, in the view of economists, souring consumer moods. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for early August fell to 94.0 in from 96.7 at the end of July, according to sources who saw the subscription-only report.  TRADE SHOCK But the trade report drew the most attention on Wall Street. Economists were taken aback by the decline in exports, which fell 4.3 percent in June. The export drop was second only to a sharp plunge in September 2001, when terror attacks brought the U.S. economy to a near standstill. At the same time, imports climbed 3.3 percent to an all-time high, reflecting higher oil prices and strong demand for capital goods. The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened to a record $14.2 billion as exports eased and imports soared to an all-time high. U.S. manufacturers and labor groups argue that Beijing has an unfair trade advantage by holding the value of its currency, the yuan, steady against the dollar. For the first half of the year, the U.S. trade gap came in at $287.7 billion, putting it well ahead of the same period last year and on track to break last year's record $496.5 billion.

        "Job Layoffs Under Bush   among Highest In US History   By Madeleine Baran   New Standard News.net   8-11-4     During the first three years of the Bush administration, the layoff rate reached 8.7 percent for workers over 20 years old, one of the highest rates on record, according to the New York Times.  The survey also recorded the highest layoff rate ever for long-tenured workers -- those who held their job for more than three years. Employers laid off 5.3 million, or 6.3 percent of all long-tenured workers between 2001 and 2003.  In the past, layoffs peaked during recessions and declined during economic booms; but a new survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the layoff rate is increasing regardless of the state of the rest of the US economy.  'No one should be surprised by the increasing frequency of layoffs,' James Glassman, senior US economist for the investment firm J. P. Morgan Chase, told the New York Times. 'It is the echo of globalization. Companies are shifting production around more frequently to take advantage of low-cost centers.'   http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item& itemid=767&amp;printmode=true  "

      " WORLDWIDE ADDICTION TO PETROLEUM     Is there really a rise in oil prices?      Which energy source will we use in future? Despite forecasts of a change to nuclear power, oil will continue to play a key role. According to the International Energy Agency demand will increase by 1.9% a year, from 80m barrels a day in 2003 to 120m in 2020. By then Arab countries will produce 41% of global supplies rather than the present 25%. by Nicolas Sarkis WHAT is behind the current steep rise in oil prices? Is it temporary and linked to the economic and political climate, or the start of a cycle that will bring a long-term increase in energy prices? Is it, as some fear, the prologue to another oil crisis caused by the inability of supply to keep pace with demand? These questions are legitimate. Some observers thought that the invasion of Iraq by the United States in March 2003 would lead to a quick rise in Iraqi output and a drop in oil prices to about $20 a barrel. But two months later the oil market came to the boil and has been bubbling ever since. This spring the unexpected rise in prices speeded up despite a seasonal drop in world demand of about 2m barrels a day. The drop in prices after the last meeting of Opec (1) on 3 June and the announcement of an increase in US reserves did not dispel concern. World demand is expected to rise again in the immediate future and the underlying factors that boosted prices to more than $40 a barrel have not gone away. The key factors are the global political situation and market forces. The price hike would not have been as sudden if conditions in Iraq were different and Saudi Arabia not vulnerable to terror attacks. Widespread insecurity and recurrent sabotage of oil facilities in Iraq dragged production there down to 1.33m barrels a day (bpd) in 2003, compared with 2.12m in 2002. Production rose to 2.3 bpd in May 2004, but that is still well below the levels in 1999-2001.The new authorities have frozen contracts negotiated or signed by the Ba’athist regime with international companies to exploit new oilfields, which were expected to double output within six to eight years. Recent terror attacks in Saudi Arabia, which is the world’s largest exporter, especially an attack that targeted a petrochemical facility and wells, were a serious shock. The current frequency of attacks makes people fear that they will be a recurring feature in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Gulf states, with the possibility of lasting disruption of exports. The big difference from the crises of 1973 or 1979 is that the basic problem then was an embargo instituted by the governments of Opec countries or a change in political regime (as in Iran after the Islamic revolution). Now unpredictable attacks by unknown groups are the problem, plus the threat of the destabilisation of the Saudi regime that undermines that country’s ability to continue its central role in supplying world demand. Tensions caused by the deterioration of the situation in Iraq and Saudi Arabia are mostly responsible for the latest price rise, called the risk premium. This runs at $6-10 a barrel, depending on circumstances, and covers both higher insurance charges and the impact of speculation on futures markets (major investment banks have allocated tens of billions of dollars to these). Geopolitical tension and speculative buying have amplified a bullish trend rooted in a change in the balance between supply and demand. Three main factors demand our attention. The first, often overlooked, is the impact of ethnic conflicts and strikes on Nigerian oil production. (The strike that paralysed the oil industry in Venezuela in 2003 also led to a substantial drop in output.) The second problem is that refining bottlenecks are common in countries with the largest consumption. After inadequate investment in recent years, global capacity currently totals 83.6m bpd, slightly more than the 82.5m bpd peak in demand in February. The structure of refining capacity is unsuited to the current demand for refined products, particularly in the US, which uses 9.6m barrels daily; a petrol shortage in May caused prices to rise steeply. When the price of refined products rose, crude oil prices followed. The third problem is that on 10 April Opec decided to reduce its production ceiling to 23.5m bpd; this led to a sharp protest in industrialised countries, adding to tension and exacerbating the rise in prices. In practice Opec members have not reduced real output, and overall supply is still sufficient to cover demand. Oil market statistics are fuzzy. Surprisingly, Opec members publish production figures three months late, maintaining the confusion between their theoretical production quotas and actual output, which generally exceeds quotas. Operators and observers play hide-and-seek, attempting to track tankers as they leave loading ports and consulting secondary sources to assess, as far as possible, the daily production of oil. A lack of transparency does not only apply to real output figures but affects data on production capacity and variations in unused capacity in exporting countries. This is very important at times of low unused capacity, as at present. The most reliable estimates are that unused capacity is now about 2.5-3m bpd worldwide. Most of this is in Saudi Arabia; production is at full capacity in non-Opec and most member countries. A major disruption in Saudi or Iraqi exports, or a strike or serious accident in another main exporting country, could cause a shortfall in supply, driving market prices up again. This risk contributed to the latest price hike; the expected increase in world demand in the second half of 2004 will stretch the meagre resources available. Another void in oil statistics centres on the doubts about official data on proven reserves and the reliability of medium- and long-term forecasts of global supply and demand. When an international company such as Shell, with shares quoted on stock exchanges, cuts its reserves forecast by about 25% in a few months, it is hardly surprising that figures published by other large corporations should be queried. Official statistics on proven reserves in Russia and the main Opec members, which are not checked by independent bodies, have prompted serious doubts for many years. There is a major problem here. The reserves of the eight largest national companies in Opec countries theoretically amount to 662bn barrels, compared with only 57bn barrels held by the top eight international companies. The recent controversy after the Simmons report (2) on the state of the Saudi oil fields and the scope for developing the reserves of Saudi Aramco (the national oil company), which amount to almost a quarter of the world total, exacerbated concern. World demand, currently at 80.3m bpd, is expected to rise to almost 120m bpd by 2025, roughly twice the level of the 1970s. Can supply follow? Only the Middle East can provide the bulk of it, which means output must more than double to avoid shortages. In the medium term obstacles to this are mostly political. To increase output will require huge investments in the region, estimated at $27bn a year. But for that to be possible there must be a favourable political climate, which is far from the case. Beyond that lies the big unknown, in the Middle East and elsewhere: when production will peak, in one country after another, before irreversible decline. The Association for the Study of Peak Oil international conference in Berlin in May 2003 was not reassuring. Disregarding claims of both optimists and pessimists, the number of new finds is falling, as is their volume. Only one giant oil field, Kashagan in Kazakhstan, has been discovered in the past 30 years and new finds do not compensate for the oil extracted every year. A geologist says that oil exploration is now like a hunting expedition on which hunters have improved the perform ance of their guns through better technology but game is small and scarce. We should not ignore another grim reality: by 2025 the steep increase in world demand and decline in reserves and output in industrialised countries will increase their dependence on imported oil. US imports will rise from 55.7% to 71%, western European imports from 50.1% to 68.6%, and Chinese from 31.5% to 73.2%. This growing dependence, in a sector as vital as energy, explains the oil wars that the big powers and their com panies are waging to gain control of reserves in the Middle East, Africa (3), Central Asia and Iraq (4). There has been serious reason to question the interpretation of the current rises - are they the first sign of a crisis caused by the imbalance between steadily rising demand and inadequate production capacity? The expansion of production capacity over the next few years depends just as much on political stability, particularly in the Middle East, as on the volume of reserves available. Longer term the slow but inexorable exhaustion of reserves means that a gradual switch to other energy sources is inevitable. Besides political stability this transition requires sufficiently attractive energy prices to allow global investment in energy production, a sum estimated by the International Energy Agency at $16,480bn (at 2000 prices) between 2001 and 2003. Oil and gas industries will need money, and more will be needed to develop other energy sources. The fears caused by the rise in oil prices may help end the torpor made possible by adequate supplies and oil prices which, even at their current level (adjusted for inflation), are no higher than the record set 25 years ago. * Nicolas Sarkis is director of the Arab Petroleum Research Centre and editor of ’Le pétrole et le gaz arabes’ (1) Opec’s 11 members are Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Indonesia.

       Summit addresses money matters over minds   By Ioannis Gatsiounis KUALA LUMPUR  -   The second Asia Economic Summit, held this week here, was significant for its predictability; for its participants' tendencies to talk of Asia's emergence and nation-building almost solely in economic terms - only superficially addressing topic questions, such as, "Can Asia's economic recovery and prosperity be sustained?" or "Will Asia stop growing?" There were many calls for market liberalization; few for social, creative, and intellectual liberation. Maybe that's to be expected at an economic forum. But it's hardly practical, for the degree to which the latter takes hold in Asian countries may well separate the haves from the have-nots between them in coming years. The buzzword in Asia continues to be "export", touted as the key to development. Everyone wants to be an exporter, but markets are finite. Not all these countries can be successful exporters, and among those that will be, many will have to find ways to offset advantages, such as low production costs, that favor competing nations. Many Asian leaders and analysts have dismissed a connection between social, creative and intellectual liberation and economic growth. They often cite Singapore, the one country in this region to have legitimately moved from developing to developed status. Singapore has become a highly competitive economy, despite being an authoritarian state, where freedom of expression has been curbed in the name of nation-building. For the most part, Singaporeans have gone along with the script. But polls show an increasing number of Singaporeans are worried about job security and the changes brought on by globalization; last year the economy grew by a meager 1.1%. If the trend continues, Singaporeans will likely have to use their minds in ways that, until now, their government has discouraged. An Associated Press headline noted this week, "Outgoing Singapore prime minister urges more public involvement in mapping country's future." In a word, Singapore's leaders need ideas. And good ideas are most likely to flow in abundance in open societies. Politically and socially closed societies may bode well for short-term economic growth - nothing like servile cooperation to get things rolling - but generally they lack the elasticity to sustain an optimum level of performance in an ever-changing world. It is the liberated mind that caters best to long-term success. A look at the United States illustrates this point. When, for instance, US steel manufacturers closed domestic factories in the 1980s and fled for Japan to take advantage of cheaper production costs, pundits started writing their obituaries for the US economy. But in the 1990s the United States added 32 million workers to its payrolls and unemployment plummeted to a three-decade low. Productivity also soared, but largely on the coattails of innovation; the dot-com boom may have been short-lived, but it was the United States that led the march. Why did this happen? In no small part because of Americans' knack for reinventing themselves and redirecting markets, where a more submissive population would see only gloom. No doubt the new millennium poses new challenges to all nations, and there is little guarantee that US economic dominance will continue. But Asian leaders are taking a closer look at what factors sustain an economy. Talk is going beyond high productivity, low costs, value-added and other economic catch phrases, to address what drives these things. As Malaysian Education Minister Hishamuddin Tun Hussein Onn said in a speech at the conference, "Because we will have to learn to live with increasing measures of social and economic risk, we need a broad strategy to ground our ability to face any sort of particular condition with creativity and flexibility." Unlike most conference participants, who tended to ignore the effect social, creative, and intellectual liberation would have on such a strategy, Onn was the first really to address the seemingly non-economic factors that impact economies. "Our most important assets will be innovative people who are soundly and comfortably based in their own communities, who are able to innovate from a particular cultural base," he said. Others at the conference echoed this need. And they seem to have a basic grasp of what it will take. "It has always been important to Malaysia's leaders that Malaysia's communities are harmonious and open to the world; that they are vibrant, 'learning communities', and 'intelligent communities'," said Onn. But what it will take and what regional governments will allow have often been at odds. Malaysia, for instance, has kept a feudalistic grip on its citizenry. Authorities are known to beat and jail peaceful demonstrators. The government and its minions consider race and religion too sensitive to discuss; the media are state- and self-censored. University students don't have the right to assemble - making the education minister's remarks more than a bit ironic. He has advocated no plan to address long-standing policies that have crippled the kind of well-rounded growth he speaks of. As one conference participant wryly noted, Onn's speech "was as personalized and sincere as a greeting card". Onn, the son of former prime minister Tun Hussein Onn, left the hall smiling triumphantly for the flashing camera bulbs. Meanwhile, in neighboring Singapore, new Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday, "[Singaporeans] may have to learn new skills and take on new responsibilities." And his staff during the run-up to his swearing-in on Thursday vowed to be more open and value more public input. Both countries have begun to acknowledge the consequences of their iron-fisted, elitist policies - what for a long time were passed off as Asian values. But Asian values are rapidly evolving, right along with the world. And adopting a receptive rather than resistant approach may prove the best way for Asian governments to keep up.

       A Wave of Destruction Will Destroy America's East Coast    By Ian Gurney The Daily Express - UK8-10-4   Around this time of the year many Britons look towards the Canary Islands for a sunshine break. What most don't know, however, is that on one of the Canary Islands lies a major global catastrophe in the making, a natural disaster so big that it could flatten the Atlantic coastlines of Britain, Europe, North Africa and the United States of America and cause enormous damage to London and other UK cities. Scattered across the world,s oceans are a handful of rare geological time-bombs which, once unleashed, create an extraordinary phenomenon, a gigantic tidal wave, called a Mega Tsunami. These are able to cross oceans and ravage countries on the other side of the world. The word Tsunami derives from the Japanese for harbour wave. They are normally generated by offshore earthquakes, sub-marine landslides and undersea volcanic activity, and range from barely perceptible waves to walls of water up to 300 feet high.  Recently, scientists have realised that the next Mega Tsunami is likely to begin on one of the Canary Islands, off the coast of North Africa, where a wall of water will one day race across the entire Atlantic Ocean at the speed of a jet airliner to devastate the east coast of the United States, the Caribbean and Brazil.  Dr Simon Day, who works at the Benfield Greig Hazards Research Centre, University College London*, says that one flank of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on the island of La Palma, in the Canaries, is unstable and could plunge into the ocean during the volcano's next eruption.  Dr. Day says: "If the volcano collapsed in one block of almost 20 cubic kilometres of rock, weighing 500 billion tonnes - twice the size of the Isle of Wight - it would fall into water almost 4 miles deep and create an undersea wave 2000 feet tall. Within five minutes of the landslide, a dome of water about a mile high would form and then collapse, before the Mega Tsunami fanned out in every direction, travelling at speeds of up to 500 mph. A 330ft wave would strike the western Sahara in less than an hour."  Europe would be protected from the fiercest force by the position of the other Canary Islands, but the tsunami would still bring 33ft waves to Lisbon and La Coruña within three hours.  After six hours it would reach Britain, where waves up to 40 ft high would hit southwest England at 500 miles per hour, travel a mile inland and obliterate almost everything in its path. Even Britain's more sheltered shores, in the North Sea and Irish Sea, will be struck by smaller but still significant swells, causing widespread flooding in major coastal cities.  "We need better models to see what the precise effects on Britain will be." Dr. Day said. However, it is likely that London could suffer sever inundation as the Thames Barrier's ability to cope with such a dramatic rise in water levels exceeds its design specifications.  "The Thames estuary is already subject to major tidal surges," says Dr. Day, "and the Mega Tsunami could raise water levels by as much as 20 feet, with the surge travelling up the river at some 200 miles per hour." Devastation along both banks of the Thames would be huge, with many parts of the City and areas along both the north and south banks of the river as far as Putney Bridge and beyond experiencing severe damage. The effects on the London underground are hard to imagine, but the entire network would become flooded and the consequent loss of life would be immense."  Indeed, parts of London would be uninhabitable for perhaps months and the cost of repairing and rebuilding the damage would be astronomical. Imagine, if you will, what effects such a massive inundation would have on some of our major public buildings near the Thames; The Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Canary Wharf, Buckingham Palace, The Tower of London, and the South Bank are only a few of the many London landmarks that would be severely damaged, as indeed would the entire City of London.  However, the destruction in the United Kingdom will be as nothing compared to the devastation reeked on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Dr. Day claims that the Mega Tsunami will generate a wave that will be inconceivably catastrophic. He says: "It will surge across the Atlantic at 500 miles per hour in less than seven hours, engulfing the whole US east coast with a wave almost two hundred feet high " higher than Nelson,s Column " sweeping away everything in its path up to 20 miles inland. Boston would be hit first, followed by New York, then all the way down the coast to Miami, the Caribbean and Brazil." Millions would be killed, and as Dr. Day explains: "It's not a question of "if" Cumbre Vieja collapses, it's simply a question of "when".  Copyright Ian Gurney 2004.

       Surprise, surprise - Bushites caught napping   By Tom Engelhardt    Among Bush administration opponents - and not just those on the Internet either - there's a deep-seated, Florida-inspired, and not unreasonable fear of an October or even November 2 "surprise". Over the past year, for instance, there have been spasms of Diebold-mania (in honor of one of the Republican-donor firms making the paper-trail-less, touch-screen-computer voting machines, considered quite capable of producing a Florida II). Or what about those "felon lists", endlessly purged in Baby Bush's state (President George W Bush's brother Jeb is governor of Florida) of perfectly un-felonesque African-American Floridians but not of (usually Republican-voting) Hispanics, felonious or otherwise? Michael Moore is heading for the state on election day, camera in hand, but who isn't? Then there have been those conspiracy-theory rumors that Osama bin Laden is already an administration captive held in a spiderhole somewhere in Pakistan until needed at the end of October. Or is al-Qaeda perhaps preparing a massive, last-moment terrorist attack in the United States meant to throw the election to the "other fanatic", the one most likely in his second term to continue to produce a terrorist dreamworld? Or will a last-second Red Alert turn the attention of voters to the presidential column, or will that alert even be the excuse for the Bush administration to postpone the elections? These and other rumors, theories, fears, and end-of-the-Republic-as-we-know-it scenarios have not just been flying around the web, but making their way into the mainstream media. For instance, Robert Kuttner of the Boston Globe and the American Prospect magazine just wrote up three election scenarios to fear, each chilling in its own way; while in a recent column ("Fear of fraud"), Paul Krugman of the New York Times, regularly on the mark, took out after the dangers of touch-screen voting as well as Jeb Bush's vote-vetting scams. According to the Times' David M Halbfinger, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry is taking the possibility of November 2 surprises seriously indeed and is already ramping up his legal teams to duke it out in battleground states where results seem in any way suspicious. ("Aides to Kerry say the campaign is taking the unprecedented step of setting up a nationwide legal network under its own umbrella, rather than relying, as in the past, on lawyers associated with state Democratic parties ... 'A million African-Americans [disfranchised] in the last election,' he said at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention in Philadelphia ... 'Well, we're not just going to sit there and wait for it to happen. On election day in your cities, my campaign will provide teams of election observers and lawyers to monitor elections, and we will enforce the law.'") And while the administration undoubtedly isn't holding Osama bin Laden for just the right moment, there are more modest recent examples of its willingness to go that extra mile down some dark alley in its own electoral self-interest. Consider, as a start, an interesting graphic recently posted by Juliusblog. It combines the clever, ever-sliding Bush approval chart at Professor Pollkatz' Pool of Polls with the major administration alerts into a pattern that looks suspiciously self-serving indeed. Or take the most recent Orange Alert, which came just after the Democratic Convention as Kerry was setting out on the campaign trail and was based on a series of arrests of al-Qaeda figures in Pakistan, the first of which, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 22nd-most-wanted terrorist, was announced on the day of Kerry's acceptance speech. To be more precise, it was announced by Faisal Saleh Hayyat, Pakistan's interior minister, at that top Pakistani hour for making crucial announcements - midnight (but acceptance-speech day halfway across the world). Actually, to be yet more accurate, the arrest itself had been made not that day but four days earlier. What's surprising here is not the four-day lag, but the speed with which the announcement was made - a kind of unseemly tip-off to any al-Qaeda figures connected to Ghailani. As former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative Robert Baer commented on the timing of the announcement: "It makes no sense to make the announcement then. Presumably, everything [al-Qaeda] does is compartmented. By announcing to everybody in the world that we have this guy, and he is talking, you have to assume that you shoot tactics. To keep these guys off balance, a lot of this stuff should be kept in secret. You get no benefit from announcing an arrest like this." All this was explained recently by John Judis, Spencer Ackerman, and Massoud Ansari in a New Republic magazine piece, "Has TNR's prediction come true? July Surprised". They add: Last month, the New Republic reported that the Bush administration was pressuring the Pakistanis to deliver a "high-value target" (HVT) in time for the November elections (July Surprise?). According to an official with Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), a White House aide told ISI chief Ehsan ul-Haq during a spring visit to Washington that "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on 26, 27, or 28 July", during the convention. When asked this week if the announcement of Ghailani's capture on July 29 confirmed TNR's [The New Republic's] reporting, National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack told the Los Angeles Times, "There is no truth to that statement."More striking yet was the announcement that followed. As part of the ramping-up of its Orange Alert, the Bush administration announced that an al-Qaeda computer expert and techno-whiz had just been arrested with terrifying material on his computer, and then, when the New York Times learned his name, evidently confirmed it to the paper. The catch was, as Reuters recently revealed, when Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan was arrested, he agreed to turn double agent - and so became that rarest of all creatures, a potential mole inside al-Qaeda. Soon thereafter, his cover was blown. "'The whole thing smacks of either incompetence or worse,' said Tim Ripley, a security expert who writes for Jane's Defence publications. 'You have to ask: what are they doing compromising a deep mole within al-Qaeda, when it's so difficult to get these guys in there in the first place?... Running agents within a terrorist organization is the Holy Grail of intelligence agencies. And to have it blown is a major setback which negates months and years of work, which may be difficult to recover.'" In this we certainly have a nasty brew of remarkable incompetence and manipulative acts aimed at helping George Bush get re-elected - the modus operandi of this administration for at least the past year or so. Can there be any question that the Bush men would consider almost any scenario that might advance their candidate's second-term fortunes? I think not. But their incompetence shouldn't be overlooked either; nor should we focus too exclusively on such scenarios ourselves. In that focus lies a lurking fatalism that has its own dangers. It leads to an overestimation of the Machiavellian abilities of the somewhat inept Busheviks, treating them as if they were a comic-book cohort of X-men, superhuman in their ability to grab fate decisively by the throat, reorganize reality to suit their needs, and manipulate the US public. In fact, if you think about it a moment, the Bush administration has proved far less competent since it tossed the Iraqi dice than either its top officials or most of its opponents ever conceived possible. And there's a surprise for you! Whatever surprises the Bush administration is planning for the coming months, it's hard to imagine an administration that's been as regularly caught off guard by events as this one. Reality has been biting back with surprising ferocity. Among their manipulations that haven't worked out quite as planned you would have to include the front-loading of the economy (those tax rebates now long gone) and the passing of Iraqi "sovereignty" in a two-day-early June "surprise" that managed to shove Iraq on to the inside pages of the papers and deep into the nightly news for a month - but in both cases (see below), reality shoved back in surprising ways. Not only is there no guarantee that an administration electoral surprise will work as planned, but it's a reasonable guess that, of the surprises that lie ahead, the majority aren't likely to fall Bush's way. These could be a long three months for Karl Rove & Co. I'm sure all of you could come up with your own lists of ways the Bush administration has been and may continue to be ambushed, but here's a little starter list of my own - 10 surprises this administration proved remarkably unprepared for. 1. "Mission Accomplished". On May 2, 2003, Bush officials halted the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier on its way home, some 30 miles off San Diego so that the warrior president, instead of walking up a gangplank, could arrive far more dramatically by jet, mug with the troops, get photo-ops galore, and then address his "fellow Americans" on the carrier deck against the backdrop of a specially prepared banner that proclaimed "mission accomplished". The first sentences of his now-infamous speech included: "Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country." At the time, it was meant as, and in the then-supine US media generally hailed as, the crowning moment in a pre-electoral campaign guaranteed to nail down a second term in office. Most observers could already imagine the election-season ads (as well as the pathetic Democrats slinking back to their holes). So here we are only a year and three months later, a mere blink even in political time, and every aspect of this scenario has been ambushed. Hardly a bit of it remains. The landing on the deck, so heroic-looking then, proved in the end but a reminder of the president's mission-unaccomplished Vietnam-era service in and around the Texas Air National Guard, a record that continues to dog him and has become central to John Kerry's campaign. As for that "Mission Accomplished" banner, only six months later, the president felt so pressed that he denied (wrongly) it had anything to do with him or his administration. ("The 'Mission Accomplished' sign, of course, was put up by the members of the USS Abraham Lincoln, saying that their mission was accomplished. I know it was attributed somehow to some ingenious advance man from my staff - they weren't that ingenious, by the way.") As for those major combat operations that were over, hundreds of dead Americans and thousands of dead Iraqis later, marines have been battling "hand to hand" with Shi'ite rebels in the streets of Najaf in combat major enough to involve tanks, helicopters and jets bombing in a major urban area. The front page of the Sunday New York Times had a photo of smoke and flames in Najaf with the caption: "Battles yesterday between an American-Iraqi force and a militant Shi'ite militia in Najaf left much of the downtown area in ruins." Most of Iraq, in fact, has blinked off any map of US control and looks ready to explode; America's Iraqi leader, Iyad Allawi, seems now to be little more than the mayor of parts of Baghdad, and as for that "reconstruction", here's a little description from the Los Angeles Times of life in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City today where jobs, electricity, water, and most everything else remain in desperately short supply: Typhoid and hepatitis E are running rampant through Sadr City this summer, as residents rely heavily on a sewage-tainted water supply to endure temperatures of 115 degrees [Fahrenheit; 41 Celsius] and up ... "If I showed you the water in our house, you would not believe it," said Taiha Abdel Reda, 45. "We turn on the tap and the water has a foul smell and we see threads of [human waste] in it." Those who end up hospitalized don't fare much better. Nuwesri said his hospital often uses water that's "just as contaminated as the water in the homes".The set of linked insurgencies in Iraq that have driven the US occupiers to complete (if violent) distraction may prove the greatest "May, June, July, August, September, October ..." surprise in the books. As the insurgency continues in one unexpected form or another to drive the administration willy-nilly toward the November polls, the story is likely to remain at or near the front pages of US newspapers and the top of the night's news. Between now and November, despite a clear US decision to crush the Shi'ite opposition immediately, things are only likely to get worse. Stay tuned on this one. 2. Those missing jobs. As Larry Elliot, The Guardian's economics editor, reported (using a quote stronger than those found in most US papers): "The 32,000 July increase in non-farm payrolls - described as 'shockingly low' by one financial analyst - was almost 200,000 down on market predictions and led to a sharp sell-off in shares and the dollar." This month's dismal job report, commented Jonathan Weisman and Mike Allen of the Washington Post, "took administration and Bush campaign officials by surprise. Bush's aides had been expecting a number that several called 'decent'. Bush officials had been reveling in Kerry's failure to make notable gains in polls after the Democratic convention. The jobs number abruptly ended the celebration." Talk about being blindsided by reality. The Bush campaign was left with dueling headlines, as in the Post, that read like this: "Payroll growth slows dramatically in July" vs "Bush assures voters the economy is improving", with the president still on the stump turning that corner. Peter Preston, also of The Guardian, wrote: Stumping 'round in the wake of Bush and Kerry last week, I was struck by how strained the president looks, and how thin his message sounds. Does the tale of a million jobs created bring crowds to their feet? No: especially after July, it shuffles into silence. Tax cuts? You've had them. Add in health and education spiels which might have been lifted entire from his 2000 election manifesto and the rest is tired rhetoric. "Four more years, four more years" ... It is not much of a pitch, and he seems to know it. There's an anxiety about his campaign you can cut with a Bowie knife.3. The wimpy Democrats turn into an opposition. This is clearly a case of the vole that roared. After all, the Democrats had been declared hardly even a party and written off as dead back when Bush landed on that carrier. The "mission" had been "accomplished", or so it was then believed, as much against the Democrats (and the media) as against Saddam Hussein. They had, until then, proved incapable of mounting an opposition to anything or discovering anyone who might be a "viable" candidate against the president in 2004. They were without a hope, a prayer, or any evidence of a backbone; and yet a little over a year later, they emerged from their convention (thank you, Howard Dean; thank you, Dennis Kucinich; thank you, Al Sharpton) angry, unified, determined to win the election, determined not to let Florida or any other state be stolen from them, determined not to be wimpified in some tank turret, and determined not to be terrorized by a "war on terror" president. If this wasn't a July surprise, I don't know what one might be. That any Democratic candidate, no less a candidate little beloved in the party (as the T-shirt of a Dean delegate put it, "I am in an arranged marriage with John Kerry") can be running slightly ahead of George Bush in the polls right now is one of the less believable events of recent times. But believe it. The Republicans are starting to. 4. Oil prices. Here's a genuine ambush. Remember when early-summer oil prices peaked at about US$40 a barrel and then were supposed to fall? The Saudis swore they would make it so, but here we are with CNN posting headlines like "Oil could touch $50" (a piece that began: "When the price of oil crossed $40 a barrel earlier this year, it generated nervous headlines and anxiety on Wall Street and likely threw cold water on the US economy. Now it seems that $40 a barrel may have been just a step on the way to even higher prices, with $50 or more a distinct possibility in the short term, according to some analysts.") Oil bad news is coming from every direction. There's the Yukos oil company disaster in Russia; those endlessly sabotaged pipelines in Iraq; Nigerian oil strikes; and who knows what else. Conspiracy theorists could have a field day with this, but my question is: Where are all those airlifted-out Saudis when the Bush administration really needs them? 5. Leaks and memoirs. An administration with a reputation for being the most "disciplined" and "on message" in history, for keeping the press on the shortest leash since Abu Ghraib, has suddenly found itself charging madly into the valley of leaks. Starting in the spring it seemed that every battened-down sector of the Washington bureaucracy had sprung a few, while former administration members began kissing-and-telling directly on to 60 Minutes and so to the top of best-seller lists: treasury secretary Paul O'Neill, terrorism "czar" Richard Clarke, the CIA's "Anonymous" (whose unflattering book just hit best-seller lists), and the various leakers and interviewees to the Washington Post's Bob Woodward for his Plan of Attack, not to speak of Joseph Wilson's Niger uranium op-ed in the New York Times (and subsequent book). There was former Centcom (US Central Command) commander Anthony Zinni denouncing the administration's Iraq policies, former Pentagon official Karen Kwiattowski denouncing the Pentagon neo-cons all over the Internet, and various former spooks, military men, State Department officials, and intelligence analysts all spilling their guts. There were memoirists to the left of them, leakers to the right of them ... In the meantime, just when the administration thought it had at least successfully set up its own private prison system out there in the imperial darkness beyond the reach of any court, including The Supremes, beyond the sight, no less oversight, of anyone, it was tripped up by modern technology - the digital camera, e-mail, and the Internet - and a single reporter who had done the same thing over in the Vietnam era. First, of course, there were those high-tech postcards from the edge ("Hi, Mom! Here I am riding camels and creating dog piles. Wish you were here! Love ..."), and then there was Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker magazine running a one-man leak brigade on torture in the provinces, and then, of course, there were those administration torture memos and reports that just began oozing out, and then The Supremes jumped in ... drip, drip, drip ... 6. What if you threw a coronation party and no one came (Part 1). At the end of July, just after a Reagan (Ron) appeared before the Democratic Convention to urge a November vote for stem-cell research (and so for Kerry), Republican operatives held out hope that Nancy Reagan would take to the Republican stage in August in a kind of riposte to her son. ("Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie made it clear today that he salivates at the prospect of Mrs Reagan in New York.") But stories soon began to surface indicating that she would not attend the convention (and that the blindsided Bush team was teed off about this). Though she has since pledged "150% support" for Bush's re-election, she continues to decline to put her body on the line for the president who refuses to support her on stem-cell research. Imagine, then, that the only Reagan who has entered the electoral fray this campaign season has just written an article for Esquire magazine titled "The case against George W Bush". Talk about surprises, who woulda thunk it? Kerry has just seized the stem-cell issue (and support for breakthrough scientific research) and is launching a series of "high-profile events" around it. "'This is an issue with legs,' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who has measured 70% support nationwide for embryonic stem cell research" - though not so long ago this was assumed to be an issue of little political use except as Bush administration red meat for its fundamentalist base. 7. What if you threw a coronation and nobody came (Part 2). Robin Wright of the Washington Post revealed the following: "The most popular Republican in the country will not be speaking at the Republican National Convention. The party's No 1 asset, Secretary of State Colin L Powell, will not even be there - and may not be in the United States, according to US officials"; nor will Condi Rice and Donald Rumsfeld, evidently, though for different reasons, I would guess. Rumsfeld and most of the neo-cons have simply disappeared from sight (at least until a second term). Imagine, the man who was the administration's top stand-up comic and general "stud muffin" back in the good old days of Mission Accomplished is now, perhaps by campaign fiat, missing in action. Powell is another story entirely. A few months back, he suddenly announced that he was pressing CIA director George Tenet (you remember him, don't you?) to explain how exactly he had gotten all that terrible Iraqi intelligence for Powell's United Nations speech. It was, it seemed to me, a signal to the rest of the boys at State that they could leak at will (which, as far as I can tell, they proceeded to do). And now, he's going fishing during the Republican Convention! "'As secretary of state, I am obliged not to participate in any way, shape, fashion, or form in parochial, political debates. I have to take no sides in the matter,' Powell told the Unity: Journalists of Color Convention on Thursday. Powell was a featured speaker at the 2000 convention and even campaigned with Bush." Imagine that! Condi and he were the diversity stars at the last Bush convention. But Sean McCormick, a National Security Council spokesman, offered this explanation for the absence of his boss: "By tradition and custom, the national security adviser does not actively participate in campaign or political events." Remind me of the last time "tradition and custom" stood in the way of Karl Rove. 8. Afghanistan. America's 10,000 troops in Afghanistan having quietly been upped to 20,000, US casualties are on the rise in the land - and war - that time forgot. Two American soldiers and their Afghan translator were killed and another American wounded by an improvised explosive device or roadside bomb (shades of Iraq) recently. Meanwhile, in a grim sign of Aghan instability, after 24 years of continuous service through the worst of times, the esteemed non-governmental organization Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) has only now shut down its operations in the country after five of its workers were murdered. America's man in Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, is known as the "mayor of Kabul". Opium-growing has outrun all bounds, warlordism is rife, and a resurgent Taliban insurgency continues to grow in the southern parts of the country (though registration for voting in the upcoming elections is surprisingly high). Events there too could ambush the Bush administration any time in coming months. 9. Things-to-come category (Part 1). Scandals, leaks, commissions, reports, investigations: Don't get me started. What if one or more administration official actually gets indicted by the Fitzgerald grand jury in the Plame case; or Hersh finally fully breaks that child-torture, abuse and sodomy story in Iraq (with soundtrack); or something really breaks on Halliburton and the Veep; or one of the investigatory groups in the Abu Ghraib scandal actually reaches up into the administration and nails someone; or ... but the possibilities are endless and there's nothing like a wounded administration to bring them out. 10. Things-to-come category (Part 2). What if al-Qaeda doesn't strike in the US before November 2? I know it's rash of me to say, but this might prove the real October surprise: The administration doesn't find Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda doesn't carry out a domestic terror attack before or on election day. September 11, 2001, happened, as we now know in copious detail, because just about no one was looking while those al-Qaeda operatives and their "Saudi muscle" entered the US fairly openly, trained for their flights, and bought their box-cutters. But with people even half-looking, half-efficiently, it's a far harder task to get that Saudi muscle in and organize an operation in the United States. While I don't discount the dangers, I still consider such an attack unlikely soon. So those of you intent on October or November surprises, at least remember that we're not the only ones they're likely to be aimed at. As the Bush administration limps toward November 2, guns drawn, wagons circled, ready for a fight, but unsure over which horizon, from behind which rocky knoll the next surprise may spring, keep in mind that reality's the great white shark and there's blood in the water.

        Chavez Celebrates Electoral Triumph8-16-4   CARACAS (AFP) - Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez celebrated a massive electoral triumph but the opposition rejected the results and insisted it won the referendum on the leftist leader's mandate.   Chavez's contested victory eased prices on oil markets Monday. In his victory speech, he vowed oil-rich Venezuela would guarantee stability on world markets.   In Caracas, a large crowd roared its approval as the controversial leader waved from the presidential balcony shortly after electoral authorities announced he garnered 58 percent of the vote to the opposition's 42 percent.   "What a great victory," he said as fireworks lit up the night skies a couple of hours before dawn.   Chavez claimed the vote was "clean and transparent," urged the opposition to recognize its outcome, and invited his rivals to join in efforts to build a more just Venezuela.   But the opposition claimed the vote was fraudulent and said it had garnered 59 percent of the ballots to revoke Chavez's mandate and cut short his term by two years.   "We categorically reject the results," said Henry Ramos Allup, spokesman for the Democratic Coordinator opposition coalition.   "I do not rule out that the political crisis could get worse," said Juan Fernandez, another opposition leader.   There were fears ahead of the vote that a close result could trigger violent clashes between Chavez supporters and foes whose sporadic battles have killed scores of people in the past two years.   As the recall referendum was underway Sunday, unknown gunmen fired at voters waiting to cast their ballots just outside Caracas, killing one person and wounding 10 others, according to the capital's fire chief Rodolfo Briceno.   Chavez called the referendum "a true democratic fiesta."   It was also a test of voters' patience, with many waiting in line for more than 10 hours before they could cast their ballot.   Some of the 14 million registered voters, eager to cast their ballots early, showed up long before dawn Sunday, when buglers and fireworks echoed across Caracas to rally voters.   Foes of Chavez had pressed for the referendum, accusing the charismatic president of wasting the country's oil wealth and of seeking to emulate his close friend Fidel Castro the leader of communist Cuba.   But Chavez claims the opposition is merely seeking to regain the privileges it used to enjoy before he launched the self-styled revolution he claims is lifting millions of Venezuelans out of poverty.   His popularity got a strong boost from recent spending on highly popular health programs made possible by a windfall brought on by record oil prices.   Chavez warned that only his electoral triumph could guarantee crude shipments from the world's fifth oil exporter, claiming that an opposition victory would lead to privatization of Venezuela's huge state oil firm, which would prompt oil workers to stage a crippling strike.   There have been market concerns that a victory by the opposition, which last year staged a two-month oil sector strike, could affect exports -- notably to the United States, where Venezuelan shipments account for 15 percent of oil imports.   The opposition (JR: supported and financed by both U.S. and Venezuela elitist and the bush oil interest using the IMF to force privatization of the huge state owned oil firm) is an alliance of right- and left-wing parties, managers and trade unionists, former military officers and civic groups, united by their hatred of Chavez, but divided on numerous issues.   Chavez was elected to a six-year term in 2000, two years after he first won presidential elections and eight years after he tried to grab power in a failed military coup.

      ¿Qué murmura aún Wotan con la cabeza de Mimir? Ya hierve la fuente: la corona del àrbol del mundo se inflama al sonido del estridente cuerno que Heimdallae empuña para llamar a la tropa. Se estremece el árbol;pero sigue en pie con susurante consejo, hasta que Loki se libera. Salvaje aúlla el perro ante el barranco de Hella, hasta que el atrevido corcel rompe también las cadenas.  Desde la mañana , armado con su escudo, un gigante viaja , y asì, furioso, el gusano se encabrita: fustiga a las olas, gritan los númenes ávidos de cadáveres, pues la Nave de los Muertos ha partido. Desde la mañana surca el mar, acercándose a Muspellheim, Loki al gobierno de la tajante quilla; a bordo lleva al lobo y a los lobeznos, al hermano de la tormente a lo largo del camino.

         Las cuentas del general El tiempo o la justicia chilena: ¿Cuál será 'el elegido' que ponga fin a la inmunidad de Augusto Pinochet? por MIGUEL CABRERA PEñA, Santiago de Chile   Cuando se creía que Augusto Pinochet, de 88 años, iba a abandonar tranquilamente este mundo sin pagar por la represión que encabezó, los acontecimientos le tuercen el camino, en los que muchos quisieran sus días postreros. Tanto la prensa oficialista como de derecha dedican extenso espacio a la noticia que hace unos días impactó a la opinión pública chilena: Pinochet mantuvo cuentas secretas —entre 4 y 8 millones de dólares y desde 1994 a 2002— en el banco norteamericano Riggs, de añejas y sospechosas peripecias en el orbe diplomático de Washington. Una comisión investigadora del Senado estadounidense dio a conocer los fondos del ex dictador, mientras indagaba en el Riggs lavado de dinero y temas ligados al terrorismo. Detrás del secreto se escondían alteración del nombre en cuentas de Pinochet y transacciones a título de empresas fantasmas. Era lógico que el entramado chileno, con sensibilidad de sismógrafo en lo que toca a Pinochet, sufriera un remezón. Al parecer, el otrora Comandante en Jefe del Ejército tendrá que responder por más de un cargo, de acuerdo con las informaciones divulgadas. En primer lugar, debería probar la procedencia de cifras sobre las que todos sus salarios juntos no alcanzan ni a acercarse, y en segundo estaría obligado a dejar claro que pagó impuestos antes de la salida de las cuentas de Chile o cuando regresaron, parcialmente, en forma de 38 cheques personales de 50.000 dólares cada uno. Hasta ahora, los voceros del ex mandatario sólo han balbuceado algunas excusas. Para cuando la pesquisa senatorial culmine se efectuarían los procedimientos para saber dónde se encuentra actualmente el dinero, y ello, a su vez, conduciría a detallar los caudales que el ex dictador ha logrado mantener en penumbras ante los ojos de la ley. Aunque las autoridades en La Moneda se han mostrado cautelosas al opinar sobre el caso, para Clara Szczaranski, presidenta del Consejo de Defensa del Estado, los hechos tendrían interés penal, fundados en la figura legal denominada "extracción ilegal de fondos públicos". Como hipótesis, por otra parte, habría de responder tanto a la justicia chilena como a la norteamericana. En torno a esta última, la responsabilidad de ratificar el delito correspondería al Departamento de Justicia. En entrevista al diario santiaguino La Tercera, un colaborador del senador republicano Norm Coleman, miembro de la comisión, afirma que las pruebas del contubernio Riggs-Pinochet acabarán en el despacho de John Ashcroft, fiscal general de Estados Unidos. Tampoco se duda que desde España el célebre juez Baltasar Garzón meta baza en el escándalo, pues éste emitió una orden internacional para que sus cuentas fueran congeladas, lo que obligó a Pinochet a trasladar dinero del Reino Unido, donde se hallaba en prisión domiciliaria, a Estados Unidos. El Riggs guardó celosamente la maniobra. Si es verdad que la prensa de derecha le escamotea apoyo abierto al general en retiro, también es cierto que olvida los famosos "pinocheques", delito que descansa inconcluso en lo que a justicia se refiere y que inundó, más que salpicó, a la familia de don Augusto.

       Banco Central Chile participa en investigación cuentas Pinochet SANTIAGO (Reuters) -    El Banco Central de Chile aportó antecedentes a la investigación que sigue un juez de las supuestas cuentas secretas que poseía el ex dictador Augusto Pinochet en un banco estadounidense, informó el jefe de esa entidad. Sin especificar los detalles de los documentos entregados, el presidente del instituto emisor, Vittorio Corbo, admitió que la solicitud provino del magistrado Sergio Muñoz, designado especialmente para investigar el origen de los depósitos millonarios del ex  urlLink  gobernante. "Se nos han requerido antecedentes y el Banco Central siempre aportará los antecedentes que se le piden (...) Sí, fueron entregados", dijo el jueves Corbo a periodistas. El juez Muñoz pidió a las autoridades económicas una serie de antecedentes para investigar la procedencia de las cuentas por entre 4 y 8 millones de dólares que el ex gobernante mantuvo entre 1996 y 2002 en el banco Riggs de Washington, y que fueron descubiertas por una investigación del Senado estadounidense. Las cuentas de Pinochet, de 88 años, eran bipersonales y su esposa Lucía Hiriart aparecía como segunda titular, mientras que entre los beneficiarios aparecían sus cinco hijos. Muñoz interrogó a principios de semana a toda la familia del ex dictador. Para prestar declaración Pinochet debe ser desaforado previamente de su inmunidad como ex gobernante. Asimismo, el juez solicitó a las Superintendencias de Valores, de Bancos y al Servicio de Impuestos Internos informes con todas las transacciones financieras del anciano militar y sus familiares, entidades que requirieron estos datos de casas de bolsa, bancos y administradoras de fondos de inversión.

        Diputados chilenos escrutarán privatizaciones de Pinochet Los diputados chilenos declinaron investigar la fortuna del ex dictador Augusto Pinochet y su familia, pero escrutarán las privatizaciones de empresas estatales que se efectuaron en los 17 años que duró su dictadura .   urlLink ¿Justicia o persecución política? 05/agosto/2004.-  La Cámara de Diputados, que en la noche del miércoles analizó el informe del Senado de EEUU que descubrió las cuentas de Pinochet en el banco Riggs de ese país, decidió no constituir una comisión para indagar sobre el patrimonio del ex dictador, con el objetivo de no entorpecer la labor de la Justicia. "En lugar de ello, resolvimos crear una comisión especial que investigará las privatizaciones que se hicieron en su dictadura", dijo a EFE la diputada socialista Isabel Allende. "Queremos investigar, porque estamos seguros de que se podrá establecer que hubo corrupción", destacó la hija del fallecido presidente Salvador Allende, derrocado el 11 de septiembre de 1973 en un cruento golpe de Estado que encabezó Pinochet. La legisladora resaltó que la Cámara también acordó que un grupo de diputados viaje a Estados Unidos para conocer el informe senatorial que descubrió los millonarios depósitos del general retirado en el Riggs. "El viaje será pronto", adelantó Allende, quien resaltó en todos los sectores políticos, incluida la oposición derechista, existe la voluntad de investigar en un plazo de 120 días las privatizaciones. A inicios de los años 90, una comisión de la cámara baja indagó las privatizaciones de empresas estatales realizadas por el régimen de Pinochet (1973-1990), pero el resultado se mantiene confidencial. La comisión que se constituirá en los próximos días buscará indagar "las acciones u omisiones" de los aparatos del Estado en la venta de sus empresas y "su impacto en la concentración de la riqueza". "Sabemos que Pinochet no sólo quedará en la historia como un cruento dictador, sino también como uno los más grandes corruptos de América Latina. Estamos seguros de que en las privatizaciones hubo vicios de corrupción", dijo a EFE el diputado socialdemócrata Antonio Leal. La Cámara de Diputados también respaldó la investigación del juez especial Sergio Muñoz sobre el origen de la fortuna del ex gobernante de facto. Muñoz investiga a Pinochet en virtud de un querella criminal presentada por dos abogados contra el general retirado por delitos de "fraude, malversación de fondos públicos y cohecho". La querella, a la que se suma una investigación de la Fiscalía, fue interpuesta después de que una indagación senatorial de EEUU estableció que Pinochet acumuló entre 4 y 8 millones de dólares en cuentas corrientes en el banco Riggs, entre 1994 y 2002, depósitos en los que también figura su esposa, Lucía Hiriart. Hiriart, que posee un patrimonio conocido en Chile de un millón de dólares, y sus cinco hijos ya fueron interrogados por el juez Muñoz en la causa. El magistrado ordenó la semana pasada a organismos financieros y bancos informar sobre el patrimonio de 39 personas vinculadas con Pinochet, incluidos sus nietos, y de 29 empresas relacionadas con él y su familia. Pidió también a la Cámara de Diputados datos de una investigación hecha en 2003 sobre un fallido proyecto del Ejército, realizado durante la dictadura en conjunto con Inglaterra, para la fabricación de un cohete en el que se gastaron 55 millones de dólares. La investigación, que no llegó a ninguna conclusión, se refiere al proyecto Rayo, un cohete de mediano alcance que el Ejército chileno fabricó en conjunto con la empresa inglesa Royal Ordnance. Al respecto, el abogado defensor de Pinochet, Pablo Rodríguez, aseguró a EFE que la familia del general está tranquila, aunque el portavoz del ex dictador, el general retirado Guillermo Garín, ha calificado las investigaciones de "persecución política". "Estamos tranquilos y abiertos a colaborar. Eso le hice saber al juez", agregó el letrado, que no quiso opinar sobre los dichos de los abogados querellantes que señalan que la esposa de Pinochet puede ir a la cárcel si se comprueba su participación en delitos de corrupción. Un diagnóstico de "demencia vascular irreversible" ha permitido a Pinochet evadir hasta ahora varios procesos por violaciones de los derechos humanos. Sin embargo, en mayo pasado la Corte de Apelaciones de Santiago aprobó tramitar un nuevo desafuero del ex gobernante de facto. La vista de este caso está pendiente, esta vez por el proceso a cargo del juez Juan Guzmán sobre la "Operación Cóndor", la coordinación de los servicios de información de las dictaduras del Cono Sur para la persecución de opositores en los años 70 y 80.

       Pinochet: Designado Juez por cuentas secretas   Por Jorge Montecinos*      En las manos del Juez Sergio Muñoz, se encuentran los casos más importantes que investiga la justicia en Chile. Aunque es impensable que Pinochet pise nuevamente una cárcel, parece ser que la historia lo recordará como una figura oscura y despiadada.El juez chileno Sergio Muñoz, acogió a tramitación la denuncia por cuentas secretas en contra del general en retiro Augusto Pinochet, y de esta manera el poder judicial da inicio a lo que podría ser el mayor escándalo político del último tiempo. En las manos del Juez Sergio Muñoz, se encuentran los casos más importantes que investiga la justicia en Chile. Además resolvió emblemáticos procesos sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos en el país.La Comisión del Senado estadounidense no imaginó nunca que su investigación sobre los dineros de Al Qaeda, generarían un batahola de enormes proporciones en Chile, al aparecer las cuentas secretas del ex dictador Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, que el Riggs Bank protegió, trianguló y sigilosamente transfirió. Sin alertar a las autoridades políticas o judiciales sobre estas cuentas. Incluido numerosos cheques enviados a Pinochet por un total de 1,9 millones de dólares, entre los años 2000 y 2002, girados de cuentas administrativas del propio banco para que no pudieran ser asociados con el anciano general.La noticia en la capital chilena tiene conmovidos a los partidarios del militar retirado, quienes no dan crédito a la información llegada de los Estados Unidos, aunque el propio Presidente George W. Bush, diga que se conocerá toda la verdad. Tanto impacto a causado la situación, que la reciente visita del Presidente Ricardo Lagos a la Casa Blanca, estuvo marcada por este tema.Sin embargo, los dirigentes más simbólicos de la derecha en Chile, casi no se han pronunciado. Sólo algunos militares en retiro y férreos protectores del ex general, lo han defendido públicamente. Nadie desea comprometerse demasiado, en un año electoral. Incluido el propio líder de la “alianza de derecha” Joaquín Lavin, que tuvo participación activa en la dictadura militar, y quién no se ha pronunciado a favor de Pinochet guardando un inusual silencio. De confirmarse los movimientos financieros efectuados por Pinochet y que suman entre 4 y 8 millones de dólares, las miradas se concentrarán en la búsqueda del origen del dinero. Uno de los más probables destinos podrían ser los “gastos reservados” del Ejército de Chile y que el propio Pinochet manejaba a su entero gusto. Otra posibilidad seria a través de las “privatizaciones de empresas”, que se efectuaron durante el régimen militar, consistente en el traspaso de importantes paquetes accionarios a simples empleados públicos, que de la noche a la mañana, se transformaron en prósperos empresarios, incluidos algunos generales en retiro. Algunos se preguntan por que después de casi 15 años de terminada la dictadura del General Pinochet aparecen estas cuentas secretas, sin que antes pudieran ser investigadas. Al parecer antecedentes existieron siempre. Sin embargo, ninguna de las administraciones encabezadas por los Presidentes Patricio Alywin y Eduardo Frei, fueron capaces de enfrentar directamente a Pinochet.Cuando se conocieron los “Pinocheques”, un escándalo financiero que vinculó a uno de los hijos del ex dictador, se aplicó razones de Estado para evitar que la investigación avanzara. Siempre se justificó el hecho porque un arrebato del dictador pudiera haber puesto en riesgo la naciente transición democrática, dejando al descubierto la poca valentía de los dirigentes oficialistas.En la actualidad y lejos del poder, Pinochet parece estar arrinconado. Las recordadas escaramuzas en Londres durante la detención del militar en el Reino Unido no volverán a repetirse. Pocos lo defienden. Incluidos sus propios hijos. El haber declarado que poseía un patrimonio de entre 50 y 100 millones de dólares e ingresos anuales, por otros 150.000 dólares, le significaría un duro revés, que sumado a su responsabilidad por las violaciones a los derechos humanos cometidas durante su régimen le sitúan en una incomoda situación. Aunque es impensable que Pinochet pise nuevamente una cárcel parece ser que la historia lo recordará como una figura oscura y despiadada.* El autor es politólogo.

       Eduardo Fernández Villa, 19-07-04     Crece la controversia en Chile y el resto del mundo ante la información suministrada por el Congreso de los Estados Unidos sobre cuentas irregulares en el Banco Riggs de Washington. Entre ellas se han nombrado empresas de papel que tendrían vínculos con el ex dictador chileno Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, con sumas que varían entre los 4 y los 9 millones de dólares. Por boca del propio presidente Ricardo Lagos, el Gobierno chileno ha negado tajantemente haber estado al tanto de la investigación del tema. Entre tanto, la embajada de Chile en Estados Unidos ha tomado contacto con las autoridades locales para prestar toda la colaboración necesaria. Además de Pinochet, en la investigación figuran también antecedentes del presidente de Guinea Ecuatorial, Teodoro Obiang, cuyos créditos y depósitos vinculados con empresas petroleras tendrían un valor superior a los 700 millones de dólares. Los hechos han causado un fuerte impacto político y judicial en Chile. Al referirse al tema, la canciller chilena, Soledad Alvear, señaló que se trata de una investigación del Senado estadounidense respecto al banco Riggs y, por tanto, constituye un derecho privativo del Gobierno de EEUU. Así mismo, agregó que el tema no será motivo de conversación en la gira de Lagos por Norteamérica. ¿Cómo han reaccionado los diversos sectores políticos en Chile? El Partido Socialista abogó por la creación de una comisión investigadora al Parlamento nacional y, simultáneamente, solicitó al Consejo de Defensa del Estado (CDE) que emprenda acción para arrojar claridad sobre estas cuentas bancarias, hecho que, entre tanto, confirmó el propio CDE. Isabel Allende, hija del presidente Salvador Allende, instó por una investigación seria y rápida, y señaló que, dada la gravedad del caso, pedirá a la Cámara de Diputados que constituya una comisión investigadora. Por su parte, tras iniciales intentos por desmentir la información, la familia del ex dictador ha decidido guardar silencio. Los partidos de derecha Unión Demócrata Independiente y Renovación Nacional señalaron que esperan la confirmación de las denuncias para emitir una declaración. Sin embargo, es evidente que coincidirán en que se trata de un acontecimiento inédito en la historia de Chile. A la luz de estos hechos, conversamos con el abogado y jurista constitucional Hernán Montealegre, quien, desde su perspectiva profesional, nos resumió los posibles pasos legales en este complejo caso. Primero, explicó el letrado, es de suma importancia determinar exactamente el origen de los fondos. Por lo tanto, se debe establecer si fueron adquiridos por Pinochet cuando era presidente de la República, si pertenecen al fisco chileno o si se trata de donaciones particulares. Sea como sea, la tarea es complicada, pues se debe certificar el cumplimiento de las normas legales en los dos casos. Aquí surge el primer obstáculo, pues la familia del octogenario dictador ha negado su vinculación. En consecuencia, será más difícil establecer la procedencia de los fondos. Por último, es poco probable que una investigación hecha por el Senado de Estados Unidos, con participación de expertos, no corresponda a la realidad. De comprobarse las denuncias, el caso puede tener consecuencias desastrosas para Pinochet e incalculables repercusiones para las Fuerzas Armadas de Chile. El general Pinochet difícilmente podrá explicar por qué tiene una cuenta en un banco de EEUU por la suma señalada. Las consecuencias se sumarían al desafuero en el que ya está el ex dictador por acusaciones de violaciones a los Derechos Humanos. Sin duda, el escenario es bastante complejo para sus abogados, quienes, hasta el momento, no han alegado nada en favor de su cliente. Cabe destacar que, según palabras de Montealegre, en Chile la sanción legal para este tipo de delitos es la de presidio en su grado máximo, pena que varía entre los cinco y los veinte años. En este caso, enfatiza el abogado, ni la consabida demencia senil podrá servir de argumento a sus seguidores y equipo de abogados. Tanto para Pinochet como para el pinochetismo, puede constituir un golpe mortal.

       EEUU ayudó a ocultar cuentas secretas a Pinochet y Obiang   Fecha Viernes, 16 julio a las 09:51:06     El Senado de EEUU revela que un banco de Washington negociaba con dictadores extranjeros. La entidad, que ya fue multada por violar leyes contra el lavado de dinero, dice que colaborará con la investigación. Un informe elaborado tras una investigación del ala demócrata del Subcomité Permanente de Investigaciones del Senado, revela que un banco de Washington, el Riggs Bank, ha ignorado las medidas contra el lavado de dinero en EEUU en los últimos años para conseguir negocios con dictadores extranjeros. Entre ellos se encuentran Augusto Pinochet, ex dictador de Chile, y Teodoro Obiang, dictador de Guinea Ecuatorial. El banco, prestamista de EEUU para la mayoría de las embajadas extranjeras y misiones en la capital del país, no informó a los reguladores bancarios de EEUU que estaba manejando cuentas de varios millones de dólares de Pinochet, que gobernó Chile entre 1973 y 1990, y de algunos altos funcionarios de la dictadura africana de Guinea Ecuatorial. En el caso de Pinochet, el informe precisa que "altos funcionarios del Riggs Bank buscaron activamente" establecer negocios bancarios con él y que tomó medidas para ayudarle a ocultar sus fondos en el banco. El texto -del que informó ayer The Washington Post- revela que la entidad bancaria mantuvo esas cuentas para el dictador chileno incluso después de que en octubre de 1998, un tribunal español publicase una autorización de detención internacional para el dictador que alegaba, además del asesinato, la tortura y el genocidio, que debía congelar todas sus cuentas. De acuerdo con los senadores, el banco intentó utilizar empresas y cuentas en el extranjero con nombres engañosos para ocultar la conexión de las mismas con Pinochet. En los documentos que solicitaron los investigadores, el banco se refería a Pinochet como "un profesional jubilado" y con "una alta posición en el sector público durante muchos años". El informe indica que el ex dictador chileno tenía depositado en el Riggs entre 4 y 8 millones de dólares, colocados en varias cuentas personales y corporativas. El coordinador de la defensa de Pinochet ha alegado que las supuestas cuentas en Estados Unidos son una calumnia. El estudio denuncia también que el banco abrió al menos 60 cuentas para Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, dictador de Guinea Ecuatorial, su familia y funcionarios del gobierno. En este país africano, donde son conocidas la corrupción y la violación de los derechos humanos, el Riggs Bank manejó depósitos y préstamos de hasta 700 millones de dólares. Antes de que sus cuentas fueran cerradas hace varios meses, era el mejor cliente de la entidad bancaria. Riggs ya pagó una multa de 25 millones de dólares a comienzos de este año para acabar con acusaciones de haber violado leyes federales contra el lavado de dinero. En un comunicado, la entidad no se refiere concretamente al informe parlamentario, pero ha asegurado que colaborará con la investigación del Senado, la cual proporcionará un cuadro más detallado de como la entidad mantuvo tales cuentas sin alertar a los reguladores estadounidenses. El informe también levanta interrogantes sobre pagos de varias compa- ñías petroleras, incluidas ExxonMobil y Marathon, a cuentas privadas controladas por líderes de Guinea Ecuatorial, por ello los funcionarios de aquellas empresas también declararán ante el Senado. Riggs abrió primero cuentas en 1995 para Guinea Ecuatorial, controlada por Obiang Nguema durante los últimos 25 años. De las más de 60 cuentas, algunas fueron usadas para depositar los ingresos de las ventas del aceite del país, mientras que el resto iban destinadas a la economía personal del presidente. Los investigadores han descubierto que entre 2000 y 2002, más que 11 millones y medio de dólares del dinero en efectivo llegaron en maletas y fueron depositados en una cuenta controlada por Obiang a través una corporación establecida en Bahamas, con la ayuda de Riggs. El banco no relató aquellas transacciones con exactitud a los reguladores de EEUU

        Las 'cuentas secretas' de Pinochet en EU AFP   Siguen las investigaciones alrededor del ex dictador chileno Augusto Pinochet.EFE15 de Julio de 2004   ¿Crees que Pinochet tenga cuentas secretas?  SANTIAGO, Chile - Uno de los hijos del ex dictador chileno Augusto Pinochet desmintió que su padre tuviese cuentas secretas en Estados Unidos, como lo informó el diario estadounidense The Washington Post.  Cuentas claras  Según el periódico, el banco estadounidense Riggs ayudó al gobernante militar (1973-1990) a ocultar millones de dólares cuando estuvo detenido en el Reino Unido. En unas declaraciones publicadas en El Mercurio, el hijo menor de Pinochet, Marco Antonio, rechazó las versiones periodísticas y dijo que esta misma información había sido desmentida en 1999.Marco Antonio Pinochet precisó que en marzo de 1999 se publicó una "fotocopia indecente" de ese supuesto depósito en el Riggs, pero aseguró que "son puras mentiras".   Pinochet fue detenido en Londres el 16 de octubre de 1998, como consecuencia de la orden de detención internacional emitida por el juez español Baltasar Garzón, con vistas a su extradición a España, por cargos de tortura, terrorismo y genocidio.El periódico estadounidense cita un informe realizado por investigadores del Senado de Estados Unidos sobre el mencionado banco, que en mayo pasado tuvo que pagar una multa de 25 millones de dólares por violar las leyes contra el lavado de dinero en operaciones con embajadas de Arabia Saudita y con el presidente de Guinea Ecuatorial, Teodoro Obiang.Marco Antonio Pinochet recordó que el juez español Garzón fue a ver esas cuentas en las Bahamas y nada fue demostrado."Lo que más molesta es que se informa profusamente de estas supuestas cuentas de mi padre, y cuando se comprueba que no existen, que todo es falso, nada se dice", agregó.Según The Washington Post, los investigadores del Senado de Estados Unidos, que pasaron más de un año examinando las actividades del Riggs, encontraron que el banco intentó utilizar empresas y cuentas en el extranjero con nombres engañosos para ocultar la conexión de las mismas con Pinochet.En el informe al que se refiere The Washington Post se indica que Pinochet tenía depositado en el Riggs entre cuatro y ocho millones de dólares, colocados en varias cuentas personales y corporativas.

        Millions of Venezuelans turn out to vote on ousting Chavez     BY GARY MARX     Chicago Tribune CARACAS, Venezuela - (KRT) -        Plagued by long lines and some confusion, millions of Venezuelans went to the polls Sunday to decide whether populist President Hugo Chavez would remain in power or his self-described revolution would be turned back. A record turnout combined with a troublesome new electronic voting system forced voters to wait up to nine hours to cast their ballots and forced officials to keep polling stations open until midnight. By late Sunday evening it was unclear whether the opposition secured enough votes to oust Chavez, a charismatic former army paratrooper whose five-year presidency has been characterized by sweeping internal changes and prickly relations with the United States. There were no reports of fraud or widespread violence, a concern for the scores of international observers who have descended on this nation of 26 million people, who have been wracked by years of strikes and bloody demonstrations. "Everything is going very well," said former President Jimmy Carter, who was helping to monitor the vote. Election officials had hoped to release results several hours after polls were scheduled to close at 4 p.m. Sunday. But, with the delays, the official results may not be known until at least Monday in a historic vote whose margin is expected to be razor thin. Both sides circulated poll results late Sunday indicating they were ahead. To remove Chavez, the opposition must get more than the 3.76 million votes the president received in winning the 2000 presidential election, and also have more votes than supporters of Chavez. An opposition victory would force Chavez, whose term ends in late 2006, to immediately hand over power to Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel and new presidential elections would be held within 30 days. Despite vilifying his opponents as "devils," Chavez has vowed to respect the results of the referendum and, should he lose, immediately run again. But the Venezuelan Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether Chavez is eligible to stand for office. "We are waiting calmly and are preparing mentally, and with a lot of joy, to accept the result, no matter what the result will be," Chavez said Sunday morning after casting his ballot. Enrique Mendoza, a top opposition leader, also urged calm late Sunday evening and told supporters to continue waiting patiently to cast their votes. Experts warn that no matter who wins the referendum the nation remains deeply divided. They urged its leaders to begin talks aimed at reducing the economic and political divisions that have been exacerbated during Chavez's presidency. U.S. officials are closely watching the outcome of the vote, which could have a major impact on oil prices if either side challenges the results and sparks violence. Venezula is the world's 5th-largest oil exporter and supplies about 14 percent of United States' petroleum products. Rafael Ramirez, minister of energy and mines, has warned that workers at Petroleos de Venezuela, the giant state-owned oil company, would not accept a Chavez defeat and could go on strike. Experts say such a move would likely send already record oil prices higher. The son of a schoolteacher, Chavez was thrust into prominence in 1992 after leading a failed coup and won the presidency in a landslide six years later. After changing the constitution, Chavez won re-election in 2000 and two years later survived a short-lived, bloody coup. Since then, Venezuela has been increasingly polarized between those who see the 50-year-old president as a hero of the poor and those who describe him as a dangerous and inept demagogue. With government coffers flush with oil revenues, Chavez has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent months on a literacy campaign, state markets that sell subsidized food, scholarships to those finishing high school and other social programs. "He's done so many good things for the country," said Obregon Jairo, a 39-year-old construction worker waiting in line to vote in a poor neighborhood in western Caracas. "I'm sure he is going to win." A father of two children, Jairo said he often shops at the state-subsidized markets and has just enrolled in the program that assists adults in earning high school diplomas. He is concerned that an opposition victory would end such programs. But Chavez also has made many enemies with his talk of class warfare, his alliance with Cuban President Fidel Castro and his effort to pack the Supreme Court and other state institutions with political supporters. Unemployment and poverty also have increased in recent years - something that appears to have cut into Chavez's support even among the poor. "Before there was work and now there is no work," said Marisol Afajardo, a 52-year-old retiree, who once supported Chavez. "The country needs a change." Across town, in upscale eastern Caracas, the anti-Chavez sentiment is even more pronounced. "Chavez is crazy," said Jerry Gregg, a 43-year-old hotel owner. "We don't believe in revolution. We are a democratic country." One thing most Venezuelans had in common Sunday was long lines and frustrating delays at the voting booth. With the stakes so high, voters began arriving at 3 a.m. outside schools and other polling places. In El Rosal, a crowd of voters let out a collective cheer as the first vote was cast about 7 a.m., one hour after polls were scheduled to open. As the hours passed, Venezuelans waiting to vote read newspapers and magazines while others chatted with family or friends, listened to music or sipped cups of coffee or soda sold by street vendors. "I got up at two o'clock in the morning and arrived at the polling station at four," said Nelly Sanchez, a 54-year-old housewife. "I was really motivated to vote because I believe in the president." As the afternoon wore on tempers flared in some neighborhoods. A crowd of impatient voters near downtown Caracas began shouting at armed Venezuelan troops guarding one polling station. "They are sabotaging the election," yelled one woman. Electoral officials said that some polling stations opened hours late because workers failed to show up on time or needed to complete the process of reviewing the lists of eligible voters. But mechanical difficulties with the electronic system that scans fingerprints also created bottlenecks at many polling stations. --- © 2004, Chicago Tribune.

         Chile refuses to discuss maritime-demarcation dispute with Peru www.chinaview.cn 2004-08-15 10:25:05  　 SANTIAGO, Aug. 14 (Xinhuanet) -- Chilean President Ricardo Lagos ruled out the possibility Saturday to discuss the sea-territorial demarcation dispute with Peru, saying the matter was already solved. The maritime demarcation with Peru in the Pacific Ocean "is a problem for Peru," but Chile will maintain its position that this issue is solved, Lagos said during an interview with local radio station Radio Bio Bio. He said that the maritime question "is not what matters the most in our relations" with Peru and he had discussed with Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo about the issue. Lagos reiterated that the maritime demarcation of Chile and Peru was initially established in 1947 and then reaffirmed in 1952after the two countries, plus Ecuador and Bolivia, held talks on the issue. He insisted that Peru could take the case to the International Court of Justice but anticipated "I will take the necessary steps to protect" the interests of Chile. The country "knows that when it is necessary to talk hard, I do it; when steps have to be taken,I do so," he added. On Aug. 6, when meeting his Chilean counterpart Soledad Alvear,Peruvian Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez defused tensions between his country and Chile by saying that the 1929 Treaty that has set borders between Chile, Peru and Bolivia is "perpetual."

         ZNet  Venezuela The Calm Before the? by Justin Podur; August 15, 2004  Today is the day before the referendum.  Not only is campaigning formally closed, but there is also a law in effect, quite common in Latin America, that no alcohol is to be sold or consumed until well after the referendum.  And with good reason, given that both the NO and the SI forces want their followers to be up by 3am and voting by 6am. The Opposition Plan One can put together the comments of the various opposition figures (please see the previous entry on the Mendoza press conference) and get a picture of what the opposition plan is.  Short of some kind of violent provocation (and there have been warnings of that as well) to try to discredit the whole electoral process, the opposition has signalled repeatedly that it plans to announce the results at 2pm.  Then, when the real results are announced after the polls close at 6pm, the opposition will say (assuming that the opposition loses the referendum, which it will if there is not fraud) that its results disagree with the official results and argue that a fraud has occurred.  At that point things will depend on the integrity of the Carter Center and the OAS (gulp).  That is not strictly true.  There are all kinds of observers here, more media than ever before, so things will depend on the ability of everyone with integrity to get the truth out past all of those who are going to lie about the result.  My own suspicion, based on the highly unscientific methods of watching the SI rallies and talking to random people, is that the result will be closer than the NO forces might like, but quite decisive. If the SI forces claims are then discredited, as they should be, they and the US will just keep the “fraud” card in their hand, waiting for the correlation of forces to change.  Then, at some point down the road, if Chavez loses a substantial chunk of support, or the army, or the oil company, they will bring out the claim that the referendum was “fraudulent” when they try to bring him down.  This is the way the same kinds of forces used the Haitian elections of 2000 in legitimating the coup that happened there this year.  For now, though, it is hard to think of what else they will be able to do. As for the role the 2pm announcement of the results by the opposition might play, it is again hard to know.  It could create some disorder and confusion, but it seems that everyone has been trying to prepare the electorate for it at any rate.  This morning in a press conference, the President of the state television channel 8, Vladimir Villegas, had it right.  He said “The opposition is announcing that they are going to announce the results tomorrow at 2pm.  The polls open at 6am and close at 6pm.  How are they going to know the results four hours before the polls close.  If they are going to announce it at 2pm, I would invite them to announce the results now!  They are not going to know anything then that they do not know now!” And it is that absurd.  (For more detail on the opposition plan and strategy, see the piece by Jonah Gindin today on ZNet and venezuelanalysis.com) Control Rooms In spite of the absence of campaignings, today is a day of frantic activity.  I realize I promised that I would do interviews.  And I have met a lot of interesting people with a lot of interest to say.  Every single one of them has one response when I ask them for an interview.  “Of course!  Call me just as soon as the referendum is over!” Fair enough.  Indeed, even if the opposition plans some bad business, it is as likely to come immediately after the referendum as it is to come before.  But people are better prepared this time around.  If anti imperialists were kicking themselves for not doing more to stop the coup in 2002 (we were) they are trying to learn from their mistakes.  I know of at least two alternative media “control rooms” that are being set up.  One is by the intrepid NarcoNews team (check them out at narconews.com and the narcosphere blog) and another is organized by aporrea.org.  What they have here is a lot like some of the best indymedia centres I have seen at the big anti globalization demonstrations and meetings.  Indymedia from many countries are here, rebelion.org, aporrea.org, antiescualidos.com, lots of alternative radio folks from all over Latin America and Europe.  They have set up computers, techies, phones, food… people are even staying here.  Of course there are all the sensible security precautions… they say they have been hacked already, more than once.  The idea of both control rooms is to create a real newsroom where people can complement each others work, where people can check and cross check information (this one has four televisions, each tuned to a different news channel) and complement each others efforts.) If things do get ugly, we have learned from (at least some) of our mistakes and can (hopefully) do better than last time. The most likely scenario for tomorrow is also the best case scenario.  A clean, uneventful day of voting, resulting in a sound victory for the NO forces, and a big party to follow.  That is what I would like to be reporting tomorrow.  Stay tuned, regardless.

         ZNet Venezuela Venezuela:Florentino The Devil And The Opposition by Justin Podur; August 14, 2004  Last night was the closing of the referendum campaign. It closed with huge marches of the opposition and the chavistas. They say the opposition march was the biggest ever—one estimate I heard, from a journalist who was at the Madrid demonstrations around March 11, is over 500,000 people. More, he said, than any opposition march, ever, including the “national strike” of last year and the coup the year before. I cannot verify that, as I was not there. I was, however, at the “No” rally. That rally was also huge, and I got there late, as people were already leaving. I am not very talented at guessing numbers of people. But there were hundreds of thousands as well, though not as many as at the massive march last Sunday. For a flavour of the “No” rally {it is always hard to know what to call the different groups. The opposition calls the chavistas “oficialismo”, the chavistas call the opposition “escualidos” or “golpistas"} it is necessary to discuss the famous local legend of Florentino and the Devil, which is the story the Chavistas have been using since the referendum was announced. There is even a feature movie coming out with the title: “A battle between good and evil in the plains”, is the byline. Florentino y El Diablo Chavez resurrected this local legend after the referendum was announced. The story goes as follows. There is a local music on the plains, based on improvisation, and musicians play a kind of competitive game, a kind of call-and-answer game. In the game, the one who gets the last word and stumps the other, wins. It is like rap, based on lyrical skill and improvisation. The champion of this game was Florentino. One day the Devil came along and challenged Florentino to a game, I think for the soul of Florentino. The one who got the last word as the sun rose would win. And there is a whole song that tells the story, with lyrics for both parts. In the end, Florentino won, of course. So Chavez says, he is like Florentino, the opposition—or the US, as you like—is the Devil, and he will have the last word. So, yesterday at the party, this music, Florentino and the Devil was the recurring theme, and variations of it and the song were sung, including various musicians doing the call-and-answer with Chavez himself. There were other jokes too… Chavez ripping open his shirt to reveal a big “NO” T-shirt underneath. It was a very festive atmosphere—as the “Si” march also appeared to be, from television and second-hand reports that I have heard—people were dancing, drinking, listening to the music. The beer to be had—Polar, owned by Mendoza, one of the wealthiest families of Venezuela, a member of which {Enrique} is governor of the state of Miranda and leader of the opposition Coordinadora Democratica. The alternative beer, if you want to drink it—Regional, owned by Gustavo Cisneros, the wealthiest man in Venezuela, and one of the main leaders of the opposition. It is not easy to escape enriching the elite, even at a “No” rally. The Opposition Press Conference I tried to rectify my non-attendance at the “Si” rally by going to the Coordinadora Democratica press conference this morning. A nice neighbourhood, certainly. A very nice social club setting. And, for the most part, a different set of media than were at Miraflores yesterday. The speaker: the aforementioned Enrique Mendoza. Interesting stuff. He registered protest with much that the government was doing. There were “hostile attitudes”, for example. International observers reported, in private meetings with the opposition of course, that their work was being “blocked”. How, specifically, he was asked. Well, he could not say specifically, out of respect for the “privacy” of the observers, who expressed worry that they might be kicked out and decided not to complain publicly, the most important thing being that they stay in the country. There are up to two million Venezuelans who will not use the voting machines but will vote with ballots, and Mendoza is worried that these ballots will be used to track voters and intimidate them. There are people who signed to bring the referendum about who now appear to be dead—he did not actually say whether or not they really were dead when they signed, something that seems to have happened—and others are getting “the runaround” from the electoral authorities. He thanked the Carter center and the OAS profusely, several times, noting that without their intervention we would not have gotten to the point we are at. In spite of all these government actions, Mendoza said, he was absolutely sure that the opposition would win. The question and answer period was interesting as well. A Swiss journalist asked if the opposition could govern within the framework of the constitution or whether they would seek changes if they were in government. Mendoza said no, they would work with the constitution. A Brazilian journalist asked if the opposition would dialogue with Chavez. Mendoza said that a condition of dialogue was that Chavez release the sixty political prisoners—these, presumably, are people imprisoned for their role in the coup of 2002. Picking up where Chavez left off yesterday, another journalist asked about all the Wall Street confidence in Chavez. Did the opposition also have the confidence of Wall Street, Mendoza was asked. Mendoza gave a touching reply. This is a matter for Venezuelans to decide. “When we win on Sunday, we will win something beyond price. We will win a victory for our values, of reconciliation.” One Venezuela, where the rich and poor can coexist The CNN correspondent had an interesting question. She said—given that there are no guarantees of transparency, what will you do if the government announces that it has won, when you do not believe that it has. Are you prepared for another national strike, or what. Mendoza answered that there was no point in such speculations, that the opposition is democratic above all. But the most touching statement came at the end. A question from TV Azteca in Mexico—the FOX NEWS or Globovision of Mexico—asking Mendoza “What kind of Venezuela are you seeking”. Mendoza answered: “We want a Venezuela where people respect one another. Where we are all Venezuelans, we are all together, whatever religious differences we might have, whatever class differences we might have. One Venezuela, where the rich and poor can coexist.” Truly, a moving vision for any country. It was, overall, an interesting set of evasions and lies, combined with some setting up for the post-referendum claim that there was fraud. As for the voting machines, it seems like fraud will be difficult to do by way of the machines. The system works as follows. You register. You are faced with a touchscreen that very clearly asks are you SI or NO with the buttons clearly marked. You press one. The machine prints out the result. You check if the printed ballot matches what you pressed on the touchscreen, then you put the paper in the box. So there is the machine result and the paper trail, and hence a way of checking one against the other. There might be ways of cheating even with this system, but it is not a system made to facilitate such things… no hanging chads around here. A last note on “polarization”. I am not convinced that it is so terrible a thing. Chavez mentioned yesterday that they cannot blame him for polarization—the country was polarized well before he showed up. All societies are, to the extent that they are unequal, polarized. When the poor are starving, that is not “polarized”, unless they are fighting back somehow or finding some expression. Then, there is “polarization”. I believe that the world would benefit a great deal if US society was a lot more “polarized” than it is. But there is a problem with polarization too, and you can see it when you look at the statements of the “oficialismo” versus the “opposition” or the “people” versus the “oligarchy” or of the “chavistas” versus the “escualidos”, different sets of names for two groups, none of which are “neutral”. Where there is polarization, there are radically different stories that cannot be reconciled, and evaluating them on their factual or logical merit is often very difficult, because the sources of the facts are themselves combatants. You are right now reading the report of a deeply biased observer, one whose biases are not at all hidden. This is not something that will change after the referendum. But it is important not to miss a key point: here there are two sets of official, irreconcileable pronouncements, both highly visible, both with plenty of power and support behind them. In most of the world there is only one, and the rest is completely marginalized. In which situation is it easier to figure out for yourself what is true… is a real question.

         ZNet  Venezuela In Caracas by Justin Podur; August 13, 2004  It has been an interesting night and day.  I have spent a substantial portion of the past 24 hours listening to Chavez speak.  The man speaks a lot.  But let me explain. Fear... My interest in Venezuela started with my interest and work on Colombia.  It seemed to me like the two countries, linked historically in so many ways, were living completely different histories today.  I remember the coup in April 2002 in Venezuela and a moment when I thought Venezuela was going to go that same route—of paramilitarism, of neoliberalism based on massacre and assassination.  But over the past two years Venezuelans have beaten repeated attempts at plunging them into that kind of future.  But yesterday I learned that I had overlooked something else—that that history of murderous counterinsurgency is very much a part of Venezuela´s own history.  Last night, at the Complejo Cultural Teatro Teresa Carreno (which is a theatre built for the rich for their own use), there was a really moving event.  An auditorium of well over a thousand people, mostly young people, students—real people, not elites—came to a launch of the fourth edition of a book by a journalist who is now the Vice President of Venezuela, Jose Vicente Rangel.  The book, ´Expediente Negra´, is an investigation of human rights violations committed during the years of “democracy” here in Venezuela.  There was a guerrilla insurgency here, in the 1960s and 1970s, and it, like so much else, was repressed savagely—the whole gambit of disappearances, massacres, assassinations.  One President held publicly to the dictum of “shoot first, find out later”.  In addition to the strangeness of an elite theatre filled with people, the event itself was quite dignified, I thought.  It would have been easy to do wrong: to turn an event that was a kind of commemoration into a way of scoring political points.  But—and this is not to deny that political points were scored—the dead were honoured.  Several family members of the disappeared spoke, and told their stories.  There were cultural events, musical groups in between the speeches.  And yes, there was Chavez, on the screen and in person. The theme of the evening was “recovering memory” ("recuperar" in spanish has a deeper meaning than recovery in english).  The disappeared were shown on screen.  Their families held up their pictures.  Their names were named (Alberto Lovera, Alejandro Tejero, Andres y Jose Ramon Pasquier, Jose Carmelo Mendoza, Luis Alberto Hernandez… and on and on).  A famous musician of the era, Ali Primera, has a song, based on something a famous priest said during a service for one of the dead decades ago—“Those who die for life, cannot be called dead” (again, something is lost in the translation but you get the idea).  The photos were shown in a montage, to the music of Ali Primera. What was the political point of all this?  Well, at the beginning of this note I said that my initial interest in Venezuela was not that of someone looking for the authentic revolution or the next revolutionary fashion—it was, instead, a kind of fear of a situation that was close to the brink, with paramilitaries sharpening their knives and waiting for their chance to restore neoliberalism.  I thought of Colombia—but Venezuelans have their own, living memories of all this.  And it only made sense for Chavez’s people to want to remind Venezuelans of what came before.  Chavez does not do disappearances, torture, and massacres, though they accuse him of being a dictator.  Venezuelans know this.  And many of the people in the opposition are people who did participate in all this.  So the cry, “no volveran!” (they will not return!) Chavez talks… The evening ended with a lot of Chavez.  First, Luis Britto, one of the old generation of leftists who is part of the government, showed some interesting videos.  To those who accuse us of censorship, he said, let me remind you of this freedom of press.  He then showed two videos of the current vice president, Jose Vicente Rangel, who was in the 1990s a TV personality, trying to interview Chavez, who was in jail after trying to overthrow the regime in a coup in 1992.  Both times, the interviews were censored, in a very crude way—a big red “CENSURADO” sign was pasted on Chavez´s face and the attempt ended. But then, Britto showed a video of a very long interview Rangel did with Chavez two days before Chavez won the elections of 1998.  That was an interesting interview—good questions, good answers.  Rangel asked about power—they say you are a man who wants power, Chavez… why?  Power for what?  Chavez said, power isn’t like a glass of water you pick up—it is something you build… I want to build a new kind of power, democratic power, popular power.  After the long interview, Chavez got up to speak himself.  “I will be brief”, he began, and he was—he only talked for an hour.  He told a story of when he was in the army, and how he witnessed the torture of two campesinos where he was posted as a young sub-lieutenant in the 1970s.  He tried, and failed, to stop it, but decided then that he had to do something.  There were more stories, too, all trying to return to the point that all those who died fighting for change did not die in vain, that today´s process is built on their sacrifices. And talks some more... Then, this morning, I did what any good journalist should do once in a lifetime—I went to a mainstream press conference at the Presidential palace!  Now that was a genuine media circus.  Several hundred people, from mainstream media all over Latin America, Europe, and some of our friends from the United States as well.  Indeed, Venezuela´s good friend Juan Forero (read his NYT reports on Colombia and Venezuela if you have a strong stomach) was sitting just a couple of seats from me.  I got to watch him school another American journalist about all the money that Chavez is spending on frivolous things like education, health care, and Argentine beef.  I got to watch him elbow that same American journalist and chuckle when Chavez mentioned how infallible the new voting system and voting machines were (that gave me a bit of the chills, actually, especially after getting a chance to read Greg Palast´s latest… do they know something we don´t?  All sides here seem to like the machines.  Is that not a sure sign something is wrong?) The American journalists (you can probably read more about this on Narconews—there was a solid Narconews team there today) projected this air of world-weariness, cynicism, and wisdom to the ways of overblown politicians.  That attitude was striking, considering how little wisdom or doubt they exhibit when dealing with their own government.  But not, perhaps, surprising. At any rate, Chavez hit his usual notes in the press conference: Latin American integration, opposition to neoliberalism, the likely overwhelming victory in the referendum, the readiness and preparation for any ‘irregularities’, the long history of US destabilization (mentioning Chile many times) in the region.  My two favourite quotes from the press conference were the following.  First, when asked about what he hopes for from the US, he said—“we could hope for a lot.  What couldn´t we accomplish with the US on our side?  What couldn´t we accomplish in fighting poverty, fighting for education, for health care, for literacy in the neighbourhoods?  What couldn’t we accomplish for all of the Americas, or for the whole world?  I would be the first one to ally with the United States for something like that.  But we cannot hope for anything like that.  I read this morning that the US is about to take Najaf.  Instead of withdrawing from Iraq, as Spain did, in a very dignified way, as other Latin American countries did, they are making this terrible mistake, with its terrible consequences, even worse.” He reminded the audience that Venezuela always opposed and continues to oppose the war in Iraq.  And he reminded those present that the reason the price of oil is climbing is because of that war, in part.  My other favourite quote was about the CIA itself.  When asked about the CIA, he said: “You know, it is like James Bond.  Now, I love James Bond.  I think the Sean Connery James Bond movies are irreplaceable.  But James Bond is not as cool now as he was.” (this is fairly loose translation, forgive me) “Look at Dracula!  Is the new Dracula as scary as Bela Lugosi´s Dracula?  Superman?  Even Batman, he’s not scary any more, and neither is Robin!  The same is true of the CIA.  We, a third world, underdeveloped country, we have taped the CIA giving classes here in Venezuela—that is, we have infiltrated them.  I’ve called the US Embassy to ask them to stop trying to infiltrate our military—I know the military, when something is going on, they tell me...” When asked if the US would try to destabilize Venezuela, he said they probably would.  “But they will fail, again and again.” Let´s make a deal? On the streets tonight, there are demonstrations.  One of the opposition, the ‘Si’ camp, which by the private TV networks looks like it has hundreds of thousands (check out venezuelanalysis.com for last Sunday’s ‘No’ march photos).  And another, a street party at the palace, of the ‘No’.  You see, there is no campaigning allowed on Friday and Saturday—so this is the last night to publicly campaign (we will see how this rule is bent or broken tomorrow...) I am in the wrong place, writing when I should be on the street.  But, I should mention the one thing that the mainstream media are likely to pick up about Chavez’s speech today. There was a tone of wanting to play ball:  Chavez mentioned the pipeline deal with Uribe.  He quoted from many mainstream Wall Street journalists and analysts who predicted chaos, and who predicted that a Chavez victory would bring stability to the markets which the markets, especially the oil markets, need right now, whereas the opposition has no plan and no idea how to govern the country.  In the midst of some very solid talk about Latin American integration, the irreversible changes to the constitution and in terms of land reform, housing, education, health, that have been mobilizing and democratizing forces, there was also this sense, that the government could work with the multinationals, work on the megaprojects, and cooperate in some areas.  I imagine the mainstream media will seize on this.  The next days of non-campaigning promise to be interesting.  Maybe a chance to get out of the media zone and talk to some people…

       Venezuelan opposition recognizes peaceful development of referendum   www.chinaview.cn 2004-08-16 06:22:15       CARACAS, Aug. 15 (Xinhuanet) -- The voting in the recall referendum of Venezuela "is perfectly underway," and there have only been cases of delays caused by the fingerprint-identification machines, said on Sunday the leader of the opposition coalition Democratic Coordination (CD), Enrique Mendoza.     The oppositionist said "everything is running smoothly," and asked his followers to demonstrate patience and wait in line for their turn to cast ballots in spite of being tired.     "Let's have patience. We are at the end of a long road that hasdemanded lots of work, so we cannot give up now. We got to stay inthe queues and cast our vote," Mendoza said.     Also, he said that, regardless of the delay in the aforementioned devices, no inconveniences have occurred, so he asked "if nothing happens, let's not start creating problems."     In order to make this process more transparent and prevent any given individual from voting more than once, the electoral authorities distributed the identification machines.     Mendoza made reference to some accusations broadcast by some television channels the machines were changing the sense of the referendum.     Some 14 million Venezuelans will decide whether President Hugo Chavez will stay in office until January 10, 2007 or have to quit the presidency at once.

       Just another false dawn for the WTO   By Manjit Bhatia      Speaking Freely is an Asia Times Online feature that allows guest writers to have their say.  urlLink Please click here  if you are interested in contributing.   When the World Trade Organization talks in Cancun, Mexico, last year collapsed after a posse of Third World states mustered by Brazil had cut the powerful developed nations down a peg or two, most analysts left of center were convinced that the WTO was doomed. In fact, as this month's Geneva talks drew closer, few gave the world body any chance of breaking the stalemate over global trade liberalization that had become bogged down in Doha, Qatar, in 2001. Since Doha, a raft of bilateral free-trade agreements - some 146 so far, and counting - have been signed between countries from one corner of the world to another. Indeed, in 1999-2000, 17 of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's (APEC's) 21 member states had already signed on to some form of FTA. A growing number of trade analysts - including this writer - were convinced that the multilateral trading system could face premature death. But the Geneva talks surprised more than a few skeptics, even this one. Not only did Geneva revive the stalled Doha Round after the world's trade negotiators reached a broad agreement to rework the thorny problems surrounding international free trade and tariffs, but the WTO looked to have been given a new lease on life. Or has it? Here's the rub. Exaltation rose thunderously from officials from the South who celebrated their victory over the powerful industrialized North. Infectious rapture, but it's about as naive as the trumpeting among Western and Third World journalists. One hack effusively claimed: "After five decades of being bullied or ignored in multilateral trading talks, the world's poorer nations ... enjoyed the first real confirmation that the balance of power has shifted a little in their direction." Supachai Panitchpakdi, the WTO's director general, was a little less effusive, saying the agreement has "strengthened belief in the multilateral trading system". By contrast there was this from Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim: "Post-Cancun, the G20 [Group of 20] was seen as a destructive force. Now it's seen as an essential part of a deal ... a good deal for everybody ... a good deal for trade liberalization ... also a good deal for social justice ... with the elimination of subsidies." How much longer the WTO lasts is anyone's guess. It could easily go the way of the near-moribund APEC and in time even the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - both of which championed free-trade idealism - as more countries sign up FTAs. In the post-September 11, 2001, world order, multilateralism has clearly become one of the main casualties of US's unilateralism. And FTAs are feeding off the frenzy brought on by the sickness bedeviling multilateralism. More and more countries seem bent on signing on the FTA bottom line, or their precursors - trade and investment framework agreements (TIFAs) - because WTO-governed multilateral free trade has failed to deliver the goods. But how justified is the rhapsody over Geneva and the WTO reviving the Doha Round? The oxymoron is that FTAs are being signed left, right and center everywhere. Even if the Doha Round bears fruit, the WTO and the multilateral trading system look likely to be overtaken if not undercut by bilateralism. And Celso Amorim's bliss looks immediately and suspiciously misplaced. A look at the state of social justice in Brazil shows it's as bad as anywhere else, if not worse. That's not because multilateral free trade hasn't borne fruit for resolving Brazil's vicious poverty circle; it's because every successive Brazilian regime - like most regimes elsewhere - has singularly failed to produce those redistributive policies necessary to underwrite social-justice programs. But Amorim still thinks multilateral free trade will bring greater benefits to Brazil, and for good reason: powerful lobby groups such as the National Confederation of Industry have vehemently opposed the government's "three paths" strategy, which, under an FTA with the US, would strip away the protectionism Brazil's manufacturing sector has been enjoying. And Brasilia is just as sensitive on such areas as intellectual property, labor standards, investment, government procurement and services. At the same time the US has been pressing the Mercosur states in South America for an "ambitious and comprehensive" Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement that doesn't discriminate between one country and another on the basis of its importance. Thirteen Central American states have agreed in principle to the proposal, but Brazil and Argentina did not - and won't without other guarantees. And those guarantees? For one, three issues from the inaugural WTO summit in Singapore in 1996 that proved massively intractable - government procurement, investment and competition - were dropped from the negotiations agenda. Developing states had argued then, as now, that the powerful industrialized states could menace national policies. And this is what led to the Cancun failure. As if national policies haven't been under attack and change given the advent of the greater internationalization of the world economy. Almost all have slowly but surely, and in one way or another, become conveyor belts to the global economy. But if there's one thing the Geneva talks also revealed, it is that the framework for trade liberalization in, say, agriculture is entirely suspect. The developing states have agreed - in principle - to cut or eliminate agricultural export subsidies. So too the Europeans and Americans, although Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan have offered a squeak and probably won't. And they've agreed - in principle - that anything approximating export subsidy mechanisms, such as export credits, will too end but - and get this - by a date yet to be fixed. That's not all: not only is the trade-liberalization framework hopelessly flawed, but the idea of market access through deep cuts in tariffs and other protectionist measures such as quotas is immediately undercut and seriously undermined by posturing a contrasting pledge of "flexibilities for sensitive products". Whatever "sensitive products" means isn't anyone's guess, though: it means, very clearly, those areas of an economy that are not only economically but especially politically sensitive - so sensitive that their reforms must and will be avoided. It's a loophole and one of many in the "agreement" that makes the black hole look like science fiction. It's a clause that'll let most signatories to the agreement in the 147-member WTO General Council back-door opportunities to list and protect "sensitive products" that they can easily claim harbor the national interest. And there goes any chance that a WTO-policed multilateral free trading system would in fact deliver the goods through easy and free access to other markets. Nobody will gain from such distortions. Geneva has proved to be another false dawn for the WTO. But don't think a string of bilateral FTAs will correct these problems. They won't. Manjit Bhatia is an academic and writer in Australia.

         Najaf Bush Ignited This Insurgency, Not Muqtada al-Sadr by Milan Rai; August 13, 2004 ASSAULTING THE SHIA MAJORITY   The United States has launched a war against a large part of the Iraqi people. It is the Bush Administration’s desire for total domination, not the militancy of Shia insurgents, that has triggered this latest uprising. The US is trying to tame the Shia majority.  At the time of writing, US forces have surrounded the most holy site in Shia Islam, the Imam Ali mosque in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, after eight days of fierce fighting with the forces of Muqtada al-Sadr, reportedly leaving hundreds dead. Elsewhere, ‘US air strikes and fighting on the ground in the [largely Shia] Iraqi city of Kut have left 72 people dead and about 150 injured,’ according to the interim Iraqi government. (BBC News Online, 12 Aug.)  ‘British troops [have also] fought fierce battles with militants in Amara and Basra... British toops launched an offensive overnight on Tuesday [10 Aug.] against Shia fighters in the southern town of Amara, killing 10 of them, the militiamen said. Hospital officials in the town said four civilians had also died.’ (Telegraph, 12 Aug., p. 12)  ‘The purpose was to regain control of al-Amarah,’ said Squadron Leader Spike Wilson, British forces spokesperson. (‘British troops kill 10’, Times, 12 Aug.) Control is what it’s all about.  NEXT STOP: SADR CITY, BAGHDAD  ‘One of the biggest challenges to the interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi, is to stamp his authority on the capital. Sadr City, as the Shia suburb in north-east Baghdad is known, has increasingly started to ressemble 1980s Beirut. Scores have died in the past week as American tanks and fighter aircraft have fought the insurgents.’ (Telegraph, 12 Aug., p. 12)  Adrian Blomfield of the Telegraph visited Sadr City: ‘That civilians are being killed by US troops is not in doubt. In a pool of blood on a hospital operating room floor yesterday, doctors were battling to save the life of six-year-old Ali Hussain—shot in the belly’ by soldiers in a US tank. The doctors said, ‘We have had at least 20 dead brought in today.’ (Telegraph, 12 Aug., p. 12)  Mehdi Nouri, a shopkeeper in Sadr City, said: ‘The Americans can never win us back now. The Americans are frightened of ordinary Iraqi people, that is why they hate us. We are frightened of them, that is why we hate them. In such a situation we can only see death and more deaths. We are begging the Americans to leave.’ (Telegraph, 12 Aug., p. 12)  ALLAWI SERVES WASHINGTON This is a US assault on Najaf. ‘Iraqi government troops are also involved, though their participation may be largely for political reasons—not least to signal that this is an operation that has the full backing of Iraq’s interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.’ (Jonathan Marcus, Diplomatic Correspondent, BBC News Online, 12 Aug.)  ‘Iyad Allawi, the interim prime minister, has laid his credibility on the line by promising total destruction of [Sadr’s] Mahdi army.’ (Telegraph, 12 Aug., p. 12) However, ‘Ibrahim al-Jaafari, one of Iraq’s two vice-presidents and leader of the biggest Shia party, the Da’awa, yesterday [11 Aug.] said US troops should stop fighting in Najaf and leave the job to Iraqi security forces.’ (Guardian, 12 Aug., p. 3)  Jaafari ‘has topped opinion polls as Iraq’s most popular politician’ earlier this year. (FT, 12 Aug., p. 7)  THE US STARTED THIS UPRISING, NOT SADR  ‘A diplomatic source in Baghdad said yesterday that it was unclear why the cleric was leading the bloody uprising, the second that he has instigated in four months.’ (‘British troops kill 10’, Times, 12 Aug.) Media reporting has done its best to obscure the origins of the violence.  The simple truth is that, as in the case of the first ‘Sadr uprising’, this violence has been ‘instigated’ not by Shia militants, but by the United States.  Go back to the beginning, 2 Aug.: ‘US forces in Iraq went on the offensive against two Islamist political groups yesterday [2 Aug.], arresting an influential Sunni cleric in Baghdad and breaking a two-month ceasefire with followers of Shia radical Moqtada al-Sadr, based in Kufa. Sheikh Mahmoud al-Sudani, a spokesman for Mr Sadr in Baghdad, told journalists that US soldiers had surrounded Mr Sadr’s house. Reuters news agency quoted witneses saying that US forces had moved into Mr Sadr’s neighbourhood in Kufa, next to Najaf, and were exchanging fire with members of Mr Sadr’s Shia militia, the Mehdi Army.’ (FT, 3 Aug., p. 9)  Interestingly, despite later denials, it was clear in first reports that the mission was to arrest Sadr: ‘The US military says an Iraqi arrest warrant has been issued for Sadr in relation to the killing of a rival cleric in Najaf last year.’ The Independent also noted that ‘during truce negotiations earlier this year, Iraqi officials said Sadr would not face arrest.’ (Independent, 3 Aug., p. 25) Another lie.  A few days later Sabah Khadim, a senior adviser to the Allawi government, indirectly confirmed that arresting Sadr is a priority: ‘Asked whether Mr Sadr would be arrested, Mr Khadim said: “We don’t know exactly where he is, but we will fight all criminals. It does not matter how big they are.’ (Guardian, 7 Aug., p. 1)  The 2 Aug. raid was followed by ‘days of mounting tension during which Mr Sadr’s supporters seized 18 Iraqi police officers in response to the arrest of several of the cleric’s senior aides.’ Full-scale violence in Najaf came on 4 Aug. (Guardian, 6 Aug., p. 2)  It wasn’t until 5 Aug. that ‘Militants linked to the firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr declared holy war on British forces’. In Basra, British forces had arrested four Sadr supporters on 3 Aug. Fighting broke out on 5 Aug. ‘after the expiry of a noon deadline to release them.’ (Telegraph, 6 Aug., p. 14)  All this is very like the start of the spring ‘Sadr uprising’, which was triggered ‘after the US-led occupation authorities closed his newspaper, arrested a key aide and called for his arrest over the killing of a moderate Shia leader.’ (BBC News Online, 16 June)  On 5 Aug., a Sadr spokesperson in Amara said of this latest violence, quite accurately, ‘The ceasefire is over because of the actions of the occupation forces.’ (Telegraph, 6 Aug., p. 14)  SADR CALLS FOR A CEASEFIRE  Despite all this, on the same day, ‘a spokesman for Mr Sadr called for the restoration of a truce agreed in June between Mr Sadr’s forces and US troops.’ (FT, 6 Aug., p. 5)  The governor of Najaf, Adnan al-Zurufi, responded to this appeal with the statement that, ‘There is no compromise or room for another truce.’ (Times, 7 Aug., p. 18)  A US diplomat said, ‘This is one battle we really do feel we can win.’ (Telegraph, 7 Aug., p. 12)  No more ceasefires.  The reason Sadr wants a ceasefire is because he wants to become part of the political process. As part of the first truce, ‘Mr Sadr issued a statement calling on his men who are not from Najaf to “do their duty” and go home... [and] announced he would set up a political party to contest elections next year.’ (‘Sadr orders militia to quit Najaf’, BBC News Online, 16 June)  The BBC's Dumeetha Luthra in Baghdad suggested that the order for non-resident fighters to leave Najaf might be ‘a tentative step to secure a place in a future Iraqi government.’ Sadr ‘urged supporters not attack Iraqi security forces, and said the recently formed interim government was a opportunity to “build a unified Iraq”.’ (‘Sadr orders militia to quit Najaf’, BBC News Online, 16 June)  Sadr was no longer calling the interim government a puppet of the US; he was preparing for political, not military, mobilisation.  It is precisely the political strength of the Shia majority that the Allawi government and the Bush Administration fear and wish to destroy. That is why they launched the raid to capture Sadr. That is why they are willing to invade Najaf and kill hundreds. That is why they are assaulting Shia communities all over Iraq.  It is not Sadr’s guns, but his votes that pose a threat to US domination. Elections (even the national assembly conference) cannot be held until the opposition has been co-opted or crushed.  Private Lee O’Callaghan, who was killed in fighting in Basra on 9 Aug. was due to return to the UK the following week. His aunt, Margaret Evans, said, ‘My message to Tony Blair is we should not be there. Why are we in Iraq? My message would be, get the rest of the kids out.’ (Telegraph, 11 Aug., p. 10)

        Breakup Of The North Pole From Dirk Dunning dirkdunning@sprintmail.com8-15-4   I am stunned almost to speechlessness.   The northeast passage across the siberian polar ice is open. The glaciers on Ellesmere Island and the northern and northeastern shores of Greenland are collapsing within a matter of days. The channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Isalnd is open. And only about 250 miles of ice remains on the north shore of Greenland connecting it to the polar ice. And that is breaking up.   Vast stretches of polar ice are pulverized and floating free in the Arctic ocean. Thousands of square miles of ice are pulverized and on the edge of breaking up into a billion ice bergs.   An immense rent has formed in the ice north of Queen Victoria Island. An even larger tear reaches up from Siberia poking at the north pole itself.   The entire north shore of Akaska is Ice free, as is all of the northern Siberian shore - all the way to the New Siberian Islands and beyond.   The last of the ice blocking the Northwestr passage at the east end of Queen Elizabeth Island is breaking up.   In short, the north pole is falling apart. And some claim global warming isn't real!?   Within weeks, the refreeze should begin. Depending on how long it is before that happens, massive chnages may occur at the pole before the freeze. The polar ice may well break free from land on ALL sides!!   This is one of the most astounding events in all of human history. And where is it on the news????
