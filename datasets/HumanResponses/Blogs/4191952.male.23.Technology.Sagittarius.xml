      In all my years of surfing the web, mainly for porn, I’ve come across some interesting sites… urlLink This  is a good one. The guy basically bought the rights to the website and put in a simple link to an email address. He gets thousands of emails daily and archives them. He doesn’t publish them or tell who they are from…I found it a good place to vent about something you don’t want a soul seeing. I guess you’d say it’s like Blogger.com, but for a one man crowd.

      I started my four 10 hour days this week. It’s something my boss decided to do to keep us from getting in a repetitive groove and getting burned out on work. So far it’s pretty cool. Get here at 7am and leave at 6pm. 7am is great since it gives me time to get ready for the day, pour some coffee, eat some Reese’s Pieces…send out some emails. 6pm is equally as great since it allows me to gradually slow down and finish up small projects here and there and also relax before I go to the gym. I made it this morning, so that’s two down, two to go. I was a bit skeptical about the 10 hours in a row, but it makes it even and you really don’t notice it.  I also got my car back. I was given a 2005 Nissan Altima, which is a great car, but going to that from a 2003 Hyundai Tiburon is a change. I spent the good part of 2 hours taking the stupid rental car back and having to get my girlfriend to take me to get it, but I didn’t mind. I was just happy to have my car fixed after over a month of having a huge dent in it.  The only snag of the day was when my baby decided to go see her friend that lived 2 ½ hours away and waited till around 2 to tell me about it, but after a little thinking, I was fine with it since it meant that I was going to hang out with  urlLink Rob  and then go to bed.  All in all, I had a good day, got my car back, and got to hang out with my best friend…can’t really complain about that. I also got to sleep in the middle of my bed all sprawled out.  I figured, a good evening away from my babe is what she and I needed…some time alone. Like I’ve said before, Separation makes the heart grow fonder. I could lie and say I didn’t miss her a little bit, and I was happy to have her call me at 9. The bed wasn’t quite as warm as I remember, but I needed that. I needed to be away and to miss her. I think she missed me too. I’m pretty sure she didn’t call at 9pm just to tell me her best-friend’s mom’s dogs had puppies…made me fell happy she was thinking of me.   urlLink

      I’m frustrated right now…my girlfriend is going through a lot of stress right now, as well as me and the rest of the family. I’m trying to be the best boyfriend I can be, but please tell me if I’m wrong for being a tad bit irritated.  Sometimes I’m at her house. She’s with her mom right now till she can get back on her feet. When there are several family members there and some friends as well, I get a little bored. I think about playing some Warcraft III w/Frozen Throne Expansion, or going and seeing  urlLink Rob.  She most of the time guilt trips me into staying with the typical, “Oh, you’d rather play a game than see me,” or “Oh, you’re going to see Rob, tell him I said hi” and then acts mad. There’s a little more to that, but I’m not saying.  Today I work 7am to 6pm. I’m working 4 ten hour days and getting a Friday off, which is awesome…well, will be awesome Friday…I had to take my rental car back as well as have someone pick me up and take me to get my car. I had Enterprise bring me back to work and then had her come and get me…well, her cousin was supposed to be taking his mom’s car to the same place, so I was going to ride with him, but since they didn’t need an estimate, he didn’t and my baby took me in to get my car. The first 10 minutes were silent until she lost her temper at someone driving 45 in a 70…we laughed and things picked up from there…we joked a little and then made jokes on how we piss each other off and laughed some more…I got my car, chit-chatted with the guy there about my new tires coming in tomorrow. She jets off, a little ways down the road I notice she’s not in sight…at one point I had to hit 110mph to catch her…  We get to the house and we’re sort of doing the boyfriend/girlfriend thing at lunch…as I was making possibly a “Trip to the hospital burger,” I hear her saying something like, “I don’t know if I’m going to be able to come or not.” Since I had no idea what she was talking about I was a bit curious…apparently she decided to go see her friend, who lives about 2 ½ hours away and didn’t clue me in on this…that’s the part I was talking about being irritated at.  My point is that Rob lives about 8 minutes from my house…her friend lives 2 ½ hours away…How am I to be the one guilt tripped into things.  I’ve since talked to Rob on this and feel tons better…  I think I pen too much on my baby to vent, though I do adore her, we need some time apart…not in big bundles, but a day here and there to let the hearts yearn for one another. I do feel the borderline of love, but maybe that’s something my heart needs time for.

      Well…just when I thought nothing worse could come out of my girlfriend’s little brother’s dilemma…more has…apparently he and 3 others, about a year ago, were skateboarding by a warehouse when the idea of “Hey!! Lets go in and set things on fire,” popped into their little heads…more or less they set a few small fires, used the fire extinguisher in over abundance to put them out, and drove a forklift backwards through a garage door. To their defense, they claim the forklift was in reverse and they never tried to damage anything. We found this out right after going to have some film developed and getting some Mexican grub at Lupes.   The problem is that he never told the Sheriff about this and there was a mystery film someone had proving what he did…along with my girlfriend and his girlfriend, we went to the dude’s house and more or less scared his little prepubescent brain into a sort of shock. His pupils grew to the size of grapes and he became pale white. Ok, one fire down, literally since he burned the tape, and several to go…well, his mom took him to confess this to the Sheriff, only thing, the Sheriff isn’t in till tomorrow. So he got to wait all night and some of the morning to go tell of this misadventure. In all of this, the owner and his son of the place and vandalization was cool about it…he said since he gave them permission to skate there, he can’t say much. He’d leave it unlocked for them at times and has since sold the place…so water under the bridge.  All in all a huge forest fire was put out.   My problem with this came when two of the boys decided to come over and mouth at the people having to work on our Aunt’s house. They had worked that morning and in some sick rewarding system, they were able to go wake boarding…yep, cause 15G’s of damage, work one morning, and get rewarded…something isn’t right here…The father of one of the kids was working on the house and was reaming my girlfriend’s brother the whole time, but says nothing to his son when the little fucker mouths off at him, mouths off at me and my girlfriend’s brother. After a few times of me throwing Ice Tea on the boy’s vehicle and scaring the piss out of them…I decide to take a break and leave for awhile…  We get back around 10pm and the boys were at my girlfriend’s house…I didn’t even want to look at them so I went to change. Apparently the one who mouthed earlier went as far as saying he was going to “get all up in my face and kick my ass.” I was in no mood, kidding or not kidding to deal with it. So after making amends with the one I threw the tea at…I told him to tell his buddy to quit mouthing…that is all, 100% truthfully folks.  We get a call about 30 minutes later from the boy’s mom…now remember what I said and take into consideration that I’m 23, and he’s 16. I’m not going to touch him unless he’s doing something less than shooting at me. I’m not going to jail with him…also that he has a mouth that’s had several older people, 18+ in age, want to tear him apart…I got to argue with his mom about me supposedly beating him up, making it strange when he comes over, yadda-yadda-yadda.  I was so close to telling her to go have anal intercourse with herself I was shacking…then at midnight, they come over and we have to “talk” about it. He sits there with this hurt little “whoa as me” look on his face while his mom shields him from the world.  I have a secret for her…with him being such a smartass, and having only a home schooled learning level of about 4th grade…there’s a chance that he’s going to be exactly what he is his whole life…the next time some big, bad 18 year old is after him, I won’t be at his house at 11pm to play bouncer…I’ll be home sipping some scotch and giggling at some Family Guy.  It’s sad I don’t have all of this taped for your enjoyment…it made little to no sense to me at all. “Let’s make Hunter the bad guy.” I was packed up and ready to happily go home…far be it for me to be at my girlfriend’s mom’s house to see her and make it awkward for that poor little shit.  I’m angry to the point that it’s hard to explain, it’s like when you want to hit something, but still alert enough to not want to damage anything of yours. Maybe I’ll go to my co-worker’s desk and kick some stuff around…  To top it all off…hold on, I’m almost done…my girlfriend’s mom was snoring so loud, it woke me up around 11:30…after going to bed around 11:00…and I had to go to the living room to get some rest…this was after my girlfriend in her sleepy slumber mouthed at me, then when I came back to the room after a dose from 1am-6am, I get in bed, snuggle some, then get an itch…obviously this was a bad thing and it shook the bed more than to my baby’s liking, the asked me what that was, then flopped back over in blatant dislike. I popped back with, “I guess I’ll not scratch my leg anymore…(almost said princess at the end of that.) She replied with “Why do you always do that? I stayed quiet, sometimes that’s better. I didn’t get a very warm kiss goodbye for work this morning, so I’m a little tired and missing that extra hour of snuggling with my sweetheart.   I had to be into work at 7am for 4 days this week and then get a 3 day weekend…four 10 hour days…7am-6pm.   I’m tired…I need some coffee and a nap…today is going to be long and I’m not sure if I’ll make it…

      I’m an animal lover…there’s very few types of animals outside of rats that I don’t like. At the moment, I’m researching buying a  Scottish Deerhound . I think the idea of having a huge loving lug of a dog is just appealing to me. I’ve spent too long without a dog running around my house/yard. The last few dogs I had that were worth mentioning were Pete, a Lab/Bird dog mix and Angel an  urlLink American Staffordshire Terrier  which is a different breed from a  urlLink American Pit Bull Terrier .   Pete: Of all the dogs that I’ve ever wished I could have a clone of would be Pete, named after Pete Rose. This dog would have jumped in front of a moving vehicle to save my life. He was a great dog that I loved so much I cried for 2 days and missed a day of school for. The think is, I hate crying and rarely do. He lived to be 10 years old and died on a cold October night. I compare any dog I’ve ever owned to him and expect them to be at or near the same standards.   Angel: She was actually my brother’s dog before he moved out…the poor girl only lived to be 7 years old. I would have cloned this one too…Angel was a powerhouse of a dog. I remember her getting out of the yard and dragging me down the road after her…I had her around the waist and she dragged me for at least 30 yards. I laugh now at how tough she was and how much fun it was playing football with her. She met an untimely death of heartworms, kidney failure, and tick disease…I cried when I buried her as well.  Anyways, right now I’m looking for the ultimate trio of dogs to own. I want one loveable dog that’s just a big lug, another dog that’s a massive guard/watchdog, and a little shit that instigates everything. As of now I’ve picked the  Deerhound  as my big lug, the  urlLink Boerboel  as my guard/watchdog, and the  urlLink Miniature Schnauzer  as my little shit. I figured the Boerboel is everything I’ve ever wanted in a guard dog, if you read the temperament in the link, that’s what I’m talking about. I’m getting a Deerhound regardless…and my girlfriend had a Miniature Schauzer named Bueller that has more character than 99% of the people I know.  You need one dog that’s your baby, one that’s your strength, and one that’s going to get the other ones into fights.

      I got called into work at 3am this morning…we had a server that a certain IT department couldn’t ping from Rockwall. So…I got to crawl out of a warm bed with a hot woman and come to work…I’m so tired right now I’m not even sure if it’ll be a good idea to go back to sleep. I think I Might play some Warcraft 3 and just wait for work to come around…Its 5:18am right now and I’m dreading the day to come.  I really hate being on call sometimes…it seems that anytime something goes wrong it’s always in the morning…at least the guys I’m talking to can speak dork, videogame talk with me…I have that glazed eye look that you get when only either being woke up at 3am, or after about 16 hours of playing video games…I think I might get to go home so I can get enough sleep to wake up feeling crappy. YIPPEE, and to top it off, I drank some expired chocolate milk and my fart emitted a smell that was like someone setting a freshly laid pile of rancid crap on fire, then throwing on some rubber tires and topping that off with some circus clowns…  Nice image eh? Ok, it wasn’t quite that bad, but in the efforts of keeping a good spirit when I’m tired, it was funny...it's 5:39am now...

      What is it about calling your girlfriend right before lunch to see what she wants to eat and being greeted with, “And where the hell have you been,” strike me as bad? Well, it was bad since she had been trying to page me since 10 o’clock and I never received a single one of her 5 pages…Turns out, her little brother was taken into custody for questioning about some vandalism that took place a few days previous. Come to find out, he and at least one other friend decided to break into an industrial area, smash a private owned car with an old fire extinguisher, run over the front of it with a dump truck, ran a tractor with the dump truck and then do a fun game of “tuck and roll” from the dump truck and watch it hit a building…seeing that they’re 16, this isn’t the end of the world for them…probably some time in a Juvi-home and maybe a little TLC with a crazy guy bunkmate name Sheila, but I seriously don’t see how this could have ever gone through their heads as a good idea. “Hey, I have a swell idea (apparently they’re kids from the 1920’s), let’s mess some expensive ass construction equipment up and then hope for the best.” It’s not like they were knocking on people’s doors and running, THEY RAN OVER A CAR WITH A DUMPTRUCK!!! I hardly think that’s something a rational person does…but what do I know, I once broke into a friend’s neighbor’s house and stole all of the mother’s underwear.   My main point is that this is a good example of stupid fucking kids doing things that they feel they’ll not get in trouble for…maybe a good punishment is to have the hillbillies, who’s gear was vandalized, come beat the shit out of their crap with some hammers and maybe piss on the interior a bit. I watched a video the same kids did to heavy metal music…if it were straight skateboarding film…or even them playing Monopoly it would have been better than seeing them do crappy backyard wrestling with poor man’s CKY impersonations. I think everyone should have their asses beat at least once in their lives…I’ve already had mine…  I might be getting a little too mad, but I don’t like the idea of cops going to my girlfriend’s house when I’m not there and not telling her what’s going on when he’s being carted off. Not to mention the cops went to his mother’s, bosses’ house at 8am to find out where she worked to go get her and then pick him up…not the smartest way to do it Chief…let’s get her fired while we’re at it…and then go smack our wives around.  Well, this is more like a rant than anything else…I guess since I didn’t want to tell anyone around here about it to start rumors, I’ll just do a little typing…

      Well, since my best friends  Korey  and  Robert  started a list of songs that touched them emotionally, I guess I’ll peter my way in and include myself to do the same. Call me an attention whore, I don’t care…I bet you don’t think I’ll run around naked…mwahahahaha…err…never mind.  I think being a musician has helped me appreciate music so much more than I did before. I’ve gone through so many different styles of music they were bound to all form a melting pot of music for my ears. Anyhow…I admittedly confessed to listening to “The Humpty Song, Baby Got Back, Daisy Dukes,” and basically anything remotely sounding like that…like a poser listening to good Charlotte and acting like it’s good, I stomached these songs like a tapeworm. The funny thing was, I started out on Iron Maiden at the age of 9…hmmm…80’s metal….what’s a good follow up to that? I know, awful ass music that should be buried alongside the landfill of “E.T, the extra terrestrial” Atari console games…so, I had a small moment of bad musical taste…  I suppose I could have quietly just written down my favorite songs and would have been just as funny as me babbling, but I’m bored…so shut up. Here’s a nice rundown of my top 20 songs of happiness.  20. Gone for Good –  Jonathan Sheldon  – Ex-Front-man of Naked 19. Learning to Breathe -  urlLink Switchfoot  18. Like a Child –  urlLink Zac Maloy  17. A Favor House Atlantic –  urlLink Coheed and Cambria  16. You Know You’re Right – Nirvana (RIP) 15. Raining on the Sky – Naked (RIP) 14. Asteroid -  urlLink Edgewater  13. Wish –  urlLink Bob Schneider  12. Hear You Me –  urlLink Jimmy Eat World  11. Fifteen Stories (Live Through This) – Mighty Joe Plum (RIP) 10. Devil in Jersey City –  urlLink Coheed and Cambria  9. Duane Joseph –  urlLink The Juliana Theory  8. The Somebody Else is Me –  Jonathan Sheldon  7. Shine – The Nixons (RIP) 6. Ten Million Years –  urlLink Black Lab  5. Don’t Cry – The Nixons (RIP) 4. San Pedro – Dollybraid (RIP) 3. Everlong –  urlLink Foo Fighters  2. Sister – The Nixons (RIP) 1. Time Ago -  urlLink Black Lab   I don’t think they’re even in that great of order, but I have ADD, so this was typed up in Outlook over a few hours and then posted into my blog. I do beleive I'll end up filling all my space in a matter of days...  Enjoy

      More or less, my hair is getting to the point where my head is hot all the time. I have a receding hairline so when it gets too thick, I look like a balding, pervert, english teacher. Any day now I'm going to buy a kashmir sweater and start hanging out in the little girls section at J.C. Penny. "Would you like some candy little girl? No? How about your...oh God, stop kicking me."  Ok, maybe not, that kind of stuff kinda makes my stomach ache. My contacts are old and hurt my eyes so I'm forced to wear my glasses...this only adds the english teacher look that I'm afraid of...next I'm going to start correcting peoples pronunciations of words and then end up get my ass kicked by a mechanic named Hector.  Seriously, if you're still reading at this point, you're either a heroin addict or more bored than I.  Anyways...I washed the protective gel out of my hair earlier at lunch when I went to see my girlfriend...I sometimes to that so we can lounge on the couch...anyhow...Now I'm back at work and the helmet-like firmness is gone and I'm sporting somewhat of an afro, but a crappy white guy one like the drummer from the Jimi Hendrix's experience. It itches and I want so badly to have it cut, but since I spend lunch snuggling, I'm going to have to act like I'm somewhere working on a computer while Heather, the one I like cutting my hair, does her job.  Well, I guess I'm off now...I'm sure there'll be another witless and worthless rant posted by motherfucking me later on...tootles.

      Well, about a week ago I decided to get off my ass and go see my best friend. I'm not talking normal best friend, I mean someone you consider your brother. In May, I started seeing a girl, and 3 months later we're still going strong and only missed one day without seeing her...that's a different story...the point here is that I neglected my friend for that amount of time because I assumed he didn't want me around. It's those types of things I hate about myself...assuming and then remourse. The thing is, it never matters if we miss one day or one year apart, we always act the same way around each other...plus there was other things going on that I didn't know about that he was dealing with.  It's funny how after a welcoming hug...and him rubbing my ass(non-gay)...we're back to talking about whatever we did before like I was just there the previous night. I guess sometimes you have to be away from someone awhile to truely appreciate them...nothing can ever take the place of many Everquest/N64 Griffey sessions.  I laugh sometimes when I go see him on Mondays and we watch wrestling...We're so unentertained during it, but we watch it anyways...I think it's more or something going on while we visit rather than we watch it...I think the most entertaining thing I saw on WWE was when Scott Steiner fell of the mat and smashed his face...Fucking Hell that was hilarious...I still have it taped.  We met in the 10th grade...funny how almost all my friends I knew before then ended up being childish dicks that never appreciated things in life other than whorish girls, beer, and...well...ok...nothing past those two things.  I have another friend that I see about once every five months...it's not so much that he's annoying and I don't want to see him, but crap, I don't feel like taking off work on a Friday to drive 5 hours to watch him smoke a joint with about 8 of his friends that I don't know...He actually invited me to go camping with him and 10 unknown people...cause he had a pound of weed and a keg...wow, the drunken 16 year old in me was mildly excited...is it a bad thing to rather want to stay home and play Warcraft 3 rather than do that? I say yes cause it would have 1.) been a sausage party, and 2.) been so damn boring I would have been trying to channel my thoughts to a computer to play a little Warcraft 3...and I'm pretty sure 5 of the guys with him were not of the American citizenship...far be it from me to think Escobar wasn't born in donkey filled adobe home, but the lack of English speaking skills kinda tipped me off. Made me think...hmmmm...there's somthing fishy about how he can't understand a damn word I say!!!!  I miss my friend...the old way he was...a horney kid who was my friend...but he's quickly becoming just a guy who you went to school with.

      I didn't sleep very well last night since my girlfriend stayed with a friend of hers. I'm used to having that extra body next to me and it was just strange. For the last few months we've either slept at her house or mine...I woke up this morning with "The Big Lebowski" still playing and me cuddling her pillow. I'm not saying I'm a sap, but I did miss her alot....We've spent one other day away from each other in the last 3 months...you kinda get used to her being there.  Anyhow, on to something else..  My car is in the shop, I drive a Hyundai Tiburon, v6, 6 speed...pretty sweet...I drove a Nissan Hardbody and a Frontier before that...till one's transmission went out and the other had an untimely run-in with a Backo (Hillbilly equipment.) They gave me a 05' Nissan Altima as a loaner...I have no insurance on it...I know someone is going to hit me...  I also missed my payment last month, so I'm hoping to get a loan from my job to cover it...it's no big deal except someone doesn't think I should get it seeing I already have one. I'm almost done paying it off and it's not like I only make $50 a week...so I'm stressed out of my mind right now.  Other than that...work is just stressful...I have the feeling there's upper managment in my department trying to give me any trouble they can find and I'm in a constant worry I'll be fired. I work my ass off and please everyone...which is a big friggin' deal since I take care of the CEO, COO, CFO, and President of the Board...not to mention the owner...this is a Fortune 500 company as well...  Anyhow...I'm done for now...I need coffee and I have some issues to close...later for now...sorry, it's early and I'm tired...I'm not trying to be funny just yet.
