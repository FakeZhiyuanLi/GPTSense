        urlLink In 1999, Dr. Mirkin published an article in an obscure academic journal likening the "moral panic" surrounding pedophilia to the outrage of previous generations over feminism and homosexuality...Last week, the Missouri Legislature voted to cut $100,000 from the university's budget, saying taxpayers did not want to finance such perversity.  Actually, I think I approve of the way both parties are acting in this conflict. Although the professor certainly should be able to profess what he believes on this issue, I don't think that the government is necessarily obligated to financially support his controversial work.   urlLink Mirkin's article , via  urlLink Metafilter .

       "I turned around and saw a black silhouette, his face hidden by a balaclava. Suddenly he ripped it off, and I recognised him,"  urlLink he told the ARD television network.   "I then asked him, 'Robert, did you shoot?' The young man was silent. 'Robert, what's going on in your head?' Silence again.  "I then showed him my chest and asked him to shoot at me saying, 'but if you shoot, look into my eyes'. Then, he responded, 'for today, sir, that's enough'. I then shoved him into an empty classroom and locked the door with two turns of the key."  Soon after, Steinhauser shot himself in the head as armed police closed in.

       Anyone personally inclined to construct the world from the subject will not regret the argument that the subject is always only an individual in the phenomenon and therefore requires a certain share of truth and error in order to achieve its individuality. Nothing, however, differentiates men more than the amounts that these two ingredients are mixed in different proportions.  —Goethe, in a letter to Schopenhaur, found in Safranski's  Schopenhaur and the Wild Years of Philosophy

      Excellent interview with Ken Wilber in  urlLink  What is Enlightenment?   magazine this month (not avaliable at the website--only on the newsstand so far). Also an interview with Robert Wright, which I haven't read yet. The Wilber intrerview is very good, especially if you are already familiar with his thought. I think it's clear by now that Wilber can no longer be called a normative Buddhist--taking a page from Aurobindo, he is transforming the tradition. A Buddhist heretic.    KW: ...In a sense, the nondual realization, which became a historical realization for a fair number of people right around the turn of the century, including Sri Arobindo, is still unfolding, keeps evolving--spirit's own self-expression keeps unfolding--and it happens, as far as we can tell, to build on what it did yesterday, which is why evolution is indeed an unfolding event in the world of form. So as this incarnational nonduality, this ultimately ecstatic tantric nonduality itself, began to unfold, and its forms of manifestation began to unfold, you find that by the time that you get to people like Sri Aurobindo, there's  such  a full-bodied understanding of this process. Even though some of the earlier sages were ultimately enlightened for their time, there's a richness, an unfolding, a resonance of spirit's own incarnational understanding in some of these recent sages that just gives you goose bumps.  AC: Wow. So what you're talking about is the evolution of enlightenment itself.  KW: Yes. If we talk about enlightenment as the union of emptiness and form, the pure emptiness doesn't change because it doesn't enter the stream of time, but the form does change, and the two of those are inextricably united. And therefore, there is, in that sense, an evolution of enlightenment.

      I just used the phrase, "Thanks for the heads up" in an email. And it made me think. It warns me about reading poetry in translation. The phrase, of course, comes from ball games--when a wild ball is lobbed, one yells "heads up" so people will look at where the ball is and get out of the way. But I wonder, if the phrase was used in poetry, how would one translate it meaningfully into another language? "Thanks for the warning" doesn't convey the same thing at all.  What does this mean about idiomatic expressions in general?

      I found this in my inbox this morning.  Message: 4    Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2002 13:08:14 -0700 (PDT)    From: Michael Christopher {anonymous_animus_at_yahoo_dot_com} Subject: Re: Digest Number 625  I've noticed a tendency for people who agree with the Palestinian drive for statehood (which I also agree with) to make excuses for suicide bombings. "Despair drives people to do it". If despair is justification for crime, then quite a few people in our own country who are in prison should be let free. Kids who lost too many family members to gang violence and grew up to commit murder...rapists whose mothers scalded, bruised and choked them. Racists who had horrific experiences which led them to attack people with the wrong skin color. Despair does not "force" anyone to do anything. To claim it does is a slap in the face of anyone who survived terrible abuse or oppression and CHOSE NOT to abuse the innocent.   At what point does an explanation become an excuse? When the choice of those who surpass their victimization goes unrecognized, and those who abuse others because they were abused are the only ones recognized. The Palestinian boy who grows up to practice nonviolent resistance, or who becomes a paramedic or counsellor, that is the one who should be famous. Despair can drive people to great heights as well as great depths. Let's not ignore the ones who made the better choice.  Michael

      Something good to always try to keep in mind is that the human capacity for self-deception, to see the world as you would like to see it, is enormous. I find that my imagination works against me--I am able to unconsciously reinterpret people's statements so that I hear what I want to hear. And it results in quite a bit of emotional pain. That's why contemporary society's penchant for euphemism and jargon is so insidious. It allows for ambiguity and imaginative interpretation. That's why speaking and writing clearly and directly is a moral imperative. And why having a healthy dose of self-criticism is wise.   Self-deception is not just a temptation, it's a reality that has to be actively and regularly beaten down.

       urlLink Marshall Whitman , former adviser to John McCain, who now runs a good column called BullMoose at the "Project for Conservative Reform" website (the idea is an organizatiion of progressive Republicans like McCain), recommends that the Democrats consider Wesley Clark, former NATO commander, as a presidential candidate. (April 16th column; scroll down. No permalink available.)    It's a good idea that could put paid to the Democrats' dovish, wimpy reputation they now have. An idea that they will, of course, ignore. I felt strongly that in the last POTUS primary election, the two worst candidates (Bush and Gore) won over the two best ones (McCain and Bradley). This is no accident.

       urlLink Kelli  asks about the difference between cults and religions.  I have studied religion for some time and have  NEVER  seen a definition of cult that does not just as well describe many forms that the major religions, and some non-religious organizations, take. It's a useless word, in my opinion, used to bully groups that other people don't like. When I went to Baptist Sunday School as a kid, I was taught that Catholics were a "cult". No joke. Yet the Baptists are at the very least just as manipulative and deceptive as Catholics. So it's a name-calling, bullying, insulting, worthless word. The origin of the word "cult" is a Latin word meaning to adore or care for, which "cultivate" also comes from.  I'm not saying that many religions are not manipulative. Obviously, many are, and many do not deserve to be placed in the same group as the great world religions, all of which I respect deeply. But these religions are great and staggeringly long-lasting because they take many many different forms. Some of these forms are some of man's greatest accomplishments. Other forms of the same religions can be malignant, as we see coming from the Middle East.

      Is the parliamentary system superior to the presidential system? In Holland, you have the  urlLink government resigning  over the neglect of the army to prevent a Bosnian slaughter. In the US, I think that what would surely result is denials, stonewalling, dissembling, and dirty tricks until the head of the government was forced out by the courts…if it came to that.  This is in addition to the other obvious advantage of the parlimentary system--that the official head of state and the working head of state are two different people, and thus some of the scandal-laden nature of our elections is avoided.  Of course, the downside is that a parliamentary government cannot do anything radical enough, decisive enough or risky enough to risk being given a “no confidence” vote. If I’ve misrepresented the parliamentary system, or if you think I'm being too hard on the US, please let me know by  urlLink email .

      In the  urlLink Wilber interview  I linked to earlier, he describes the thesis of his new novel as:  Beyond pluralism and irony, there is spirit and ecstacy.  This is actually a composite of phrases, and not a direct quotation, but I think that he would approve of it. I also think that his holism can be summarized in the following way:  All objects are also, in some sense, subjects.  Other times, Wilber seems to being saying something very similar but more controversial:  All objects are a single subject.  And I think this summary shows the commonality between what I have termed the four schools of holism: the Indian (the Buddha and the  Vedas ), the Greek (Heraclitus, Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, Dante*), the German (Goethe, Hegel, Schelling, Schopenhaur, Emerson, Rilke) and the contemporary (Aurobindo, Wilber).  *I know that Dante and Augustine were not Greek (in fact, Augustine was  urlLink African --Carthaginian?), but they were certainly Platonists. Emerson was not German, but he was a Hegelian--although it may be more accurate, as well as more convenient for the purposes of this notebook, to say that he was a Goethean. I believe that there are more contemporary holists than Aurobindo and Wilber, and some quotations indicating such are  urlLink here .

      I promised someone an essay on Goethe and I haven't come up with anything yet. But  urlLink here is an excellent article  surveying Goethe's life and works. Note especially that his  Sturm und Drang  period was prior to even the birth of most of the English Romantics, and that the German Romantic movement was named in opposition to Goethe and Schiller's Classicism. So why is Goethe considered a Romantic by most English majors and even some textbooks? You tell me.  From the article, I put together a chronology of Goethe's works.   1773	Goetz of Berlichingen - A play about a Medieval hero with a (literal) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iron hand. 1774 	The Sorrows of Young Werther -The ultimate Romantic novel of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unrequited love. 1775	Faust: A Fragment - The core of Faust's romance and wager.  1787	Iphigenia in Tauris - Goethe's ultimate classical play, about the &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;triumph of honesty, strength and ethics over adversity. 1789	Torquato Tasso - A play about an Italian playwright who represents all &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;poets. 1789	Roman Elegies - Poems, some off-color, written while in Italy. 1790	The Metamorphosis of Plants - Attempt to discover a primal form in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;various plants. 1794	Reynard the Fox - Fable of the utility of cunning. 1795	Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship - A  Bildungsroman : an novelistic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; account of the cultural education of a young man.  1795	Conversations of German Refugees 1798	Hermann and Dorothea - A classical poetic epic of a German couple. 1809	Elective Affinities - A romantic and tragic novel about partner &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; switching and a mystical scientific principle.  1810	Theory of Colors - An attempt to "save the phenomena" of light &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and an attack on Newton's very well established optic theory. 1811-33     From My Life: Truth and Poetry - One of the first psychologically &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; literate autobiographies, not unlike Rousseau's  Confessions . 1816	Italian Journey - An autobiographical account of Goethe's flight from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;literary celebrity into the land that is the inspiration for Goethe's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classical period. 1819	West-Eastern Divan - The first book of world literaure, a book of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poetry including many homages to eastern writers including &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohammad, Rumi, and Hafiz.  1821         Wilhelm Meister's Travels - Continuation of the  bildungsroman  and a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready vehicle for Goethe's opinions.  1832	Faust, Part Two - Faust has more symbolic, mythic and bizarre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poetical adventures. 1836	Conversations with Goethe - The conversations of Goethe's last ten &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;years, arranged by date and recorded more or less accurately by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goethe's assistant, Eckermann.

       urlLink Kelli  asked some questions about AI on her blog. I’ll take a shot at answering them.     would we gaze in wonder and awe as David did during the last day with his 'mother' if we knew it were the last day with someone in our lives?     I think the answer is “No”, and made the final section of the movie somewhat implausible. But—let’s face it—the entire movie is enormously, audaciously speculative, and the last section completely so. But why wouldn’t we be able to enjoy our last day with our mother, as David did? Because our emotions would irrationally interfere with the experience that we would like to have. David’s did not. Was Kubrick implying that there were ways in which  David was superior to humans, that, mature, he had better control over his emotions? I think yes, in fact, David and the other bots were almost continuously and multi-factedly portrayed as superior to human beings.    is it true that life is merely a journey to fill the empty gap created by the separation with our parents?    Is this a quotation from the movie? Very interesting if so. It’s a bit too unreconstructedly Freudian for me, but probably does describe one level of our existential quest. So my answer is: take out the word “merely”. Life is that, in addition to a host of other things. The problem with Freudianism is it’s typically reductive use, reducing all of life to it’s rather meager outlook.    would the gigolo dude replace woman’s need for sexual fulfillment so that she could concentrate more fully on 'nurturing' relationships with other women? this appears to be the more important question for me. female/female relationships are smoother.     I’m going to cowardly duck away from this question, with the excuse that, being a man, I have no female/female relationships. Suffice to say that the excess of hormones that nature has imbued both men and women with insures that there will probably be a significant amount of unsatisfied sexual longing to keep Gigolo Joe and Jane busy. Personally, I doubt that female/female relationships are any less competitive or aggressive than male/male relationships, the aggression just takes less overt forms.   sz

      Someone wrote me and recommended Kundera to me. Here is my response.  Kundera and his "Unbearable Lightness of Being" is actually illuminates many of the world's problems. A better title for Kundera's book would be the "Unbearable Flatness of Materialism". And Kundera very accurately describes the unecessarily flattened and lightened world that many people live in today.  Think of the cosmos as the ancients saw it. A timeless, incomprehensible cathedral infinitely reflecting itself. We moderns often laughingly marvel at the naïveté of the ancients and medeivals. The planets, perfect musically-integrated spheres in harmony with everything else. That's where astrology comes from, another beautiful ancient science—and not a separate science or belief, but a small, utterly integrated part of the vision of—what?—the world, life, existence, reality. It was a vision of being. Yes, matter exists, but that's a less interesting part of the world. This was the view of the Pythagoreans, with their mathematical cosmology. Aeschylus, Sophocles, Pindar, Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, Dante, etc. all had this view. Shakespeare saw it slipping away forever. (cf. Ulysses' speech in Troilus & Cressida below.) Socrates, Aristotle, Copernicus, Newton, and esp. Darwin all helped to take this vision apart bit by bit until now, in the 20th century, we are left with Kundera's unbearably light being. It is totally unbearable to me. We have benefitted materially from this materialism—ample food, clean running water, electricity, antibiotics, etc. But we have suffered spiritually. Others have tried to repair the damage: Goethe, Hegel, Schelling, Emerson, Nietzsche, Rilke, Heidegger. I don't think the romantics got it—Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman, Baudelaire—they seem to accept the materialistic dogma too sincerely, rather than transcending it. It is an attempt to create an animism of the spirit. I think that we are all post-Kantians, like it or not. Just as we are all moderns. We are all post-Socratic, post-Copernican, post-Newtonian, post-Kantian and post-Darwinian. Creationists belong to the same group as flat-earthers. We don't live in Plato's or Sophocles' world, or Jesus' for that matter, like it or not.  Kant showed that our senses create our consciousness, that we don't see things-as-they-are-in-themselves (ding-an-sich), but only things-as-they-appear-to-us. He created back doors for Christian dogma, but they were obviously insufficient to actually instill belief in anyone. I believe Existentialism is a reaction to the crisis that Kant created.   To me, existentialism is all about believing that your intuition (usually your moral intuition, but could also be your artistic or other intuition.) is REAL. As real as anything. Existentialism is post-Kantian. It says, "Kant says that my perceptions do not reflect the real world. Well maybe the objects of my perception aren't real, but I know what is real. To Kierkegaard, that was his commitment to Jesus. That's what he knew was real. Kierkegaard: "Purity of heart is to will one thing." That is to say, following your intuition simply IS morality. That's all we truly have, all we are given with certainty. He also called it the “teleological suspension of the ethical”.  For useful consciousness to evolve through random processes is the height of improbability. If we do not perceive things as they actually exist, how can we communicate? How can we know anything? Hegel's answer is that Geist (German for spirit or mind) is the stuff that the whole world is made of. The corollary to Hegel's idea is that evolution is not simply the natural selection of random mutations, but is rather spirit maturing, and is thus a mentel phenomenon as much as a physical one.   "Just as the seed bears in itself the whole nature of the tree, including the taste and form of its fruit, so do the first traces of Spirit virtually contain the whole of its own history...The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom..." –Hegel, Lectures on the Philosophy of History  Emerson takes this idea a step further. He tends toward mysticism, because he extends this reliance on intuition to include all of knowledge, to include our mental, spiritual and scientific lives.   So although Kundera is an interesting writer that I liked, rejecting his worldview is central to me. And that's why tracing the history of consciousness is not merely "the evolution of culture", but a spiritual aspiration par excellence.  Here’s part of Ulysses' speech the Troilus & Cressida quotation. If you'd like to see it in context, go  urlLink here  and hit Ctrl-F and search on the term "lack'd".  Shakespeare was a conservative who thought the world was getting steadily worse, whereas I sam a progressive that thinks the world is progressing towards something, but I can't say whether it will be better. I think it will be different and incommensurable, as ours is when compared to earlier periods. I like this quotation, because Shakespeare, at the beginning of the modern age, saw the medieval/ancient cosmology, which had his deep respect, slipping away, and being replaced with our materialistic view. I believe the Goethe is among the authors who moved beyond materialism into a cosmology that more resembles the interconnected, hierarchical view of the ancients.           The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,     Observe degree, priority, and place,     Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,     Office, and custom, in all line of order;     And therefore is the glorious planet Sol     In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd     Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye     Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,     And posts, like the commandment of a king,     Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets     In evil mixture to disorder wander,     What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,     What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,     Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,     Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,     The unity and married calm of states     Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak'd,     Which is the ladder of all high designs,     The enterprise is sick! How could communities,     Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,     Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,     The primogenity and due of birth,     Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,     But by degree, stand in authentic place?     Take but degree away, untune that string,     And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts     In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters     Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,     And make a sop of all this solid globe;     Strength should be lord of imbecility,     And the rude son should strike his father dead;     Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong-     Between whose endless jar justice resides-     Should lose their names, and so should justice too.     Then everything includes itself in power,     Power into will, will into appetite;     And appetite, an universal wolf,     So doubly seconded with will and power,     Must make perforce an universal prey,     And last eat up himself.

      Peggy Noonan, who I...what's the word? ...despise? ...am existentially annoyed by? Anyways, she has a  urlLink column  today on praying for peace in the Middle East, because it is all that we can do.  I remember when George Bush the First launched the Persian Gulf War, and then said, "Now all we can do is pray". I happened to be a the height of my anti-Christian college days, and I was beyond myself with fury at the irresponsibility and Medieval outlook of his words.  Today, I am more accepting of religion, and Noonan's column, apart from my visceral distaste for her general political and moral outlook, makes me wonder about the transcendence of prayer. How can I recommend Eastern meditation or contemplation and not recognize that prayer is not really so different?  I suppose that a major difference is that petitionary prayer is often quite egotistical. Prayers for a better job, etc. are centered on what the individual wants or thinks they need rather than aimed at expanding consciousness beyond the ego. (Echo of Kubrick: "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite".) But that seems to be a difference of degree, not of kind.

       urlLink Article by David Brooks  in the  urlLink Weekly Standard  via  urlLink Arts & Letters Daily .  The article is articulate, persuasive, and well-written, but utterly wrong and deliberately blind. It's more interesting as an exhibit in sophistry than anything else. The ostensible point is that there is no higher ethic than materialism. The author paints all arguments against materialism (and, incidentally, the entire continent of Europe) as, basically, allied to terrorism. It is diificult to underestimate the willful ignorance, and intellectual damage that an article like this can do.

       "Being is desirable because it is identical with Beauty, and Beauty is loved because it is Being. We ourselves possess Beauty when we are true to our own being; ugliness is in going over to another order; knowing ourselves, we are beautiful; in self-ignorance, we are ugly." -Plotinus   A major problem with a thorough-going holistic monism like Plotinus' is that is begs the question: what is the opposite of being? In Plotinus' view of the world, meditation brings us closer to the One. Physical matter is less permeated with the One than mental entities.   In reply, any positivist will say, as oppossed to what? What else is there other than the One? If the One is all there is, how can something be less permeated with the One than something else? What is the background behind which the One exists? Basically, according to logical positivists, if you say that everything is made of something you aren't saying anything at all.  The response is that this is not a metaphysical theory, but instead, a theory of consciousness, and that, in any case, there is no difference between the two types of theories.  Another response is that there is a rhetorical component to Plotinus' words that is more substantial than the literal meaning. But Plotinus definitely seemed to believe in his system.  And, you know, materialism, for all its contemporary, and hopefully short-lived, hubris, has the same problem. Namely, what is the substance in which protons, neutrons and electrons exist (or quarks, if you prefer the sub-subatomic level)? "A void" is not the most theoretically satisfying of answers.  Others that I consider holistic monists include the Buddha, Lao-Tsu, Heraclitus, Plato, Goethe, Hegel, Schelling, Schopenhaur, Emerson, and Aurobindo. Augustine and Dante were influenced by Plotinus' and Plato's holism. Note that there is an Indian, a Greek, and a German school of holism.

      While watching  2001 , Ted and I noticed many things that George Lucas  stole  borrowed from Kubrick's venture into sci-fi. The spacepod looks like the one R2-D2 escapes in. The bulbous nose of the Jupiter vessel looks like the Death Star, complete with the crater-like cone drilled into it. When the Pan-Am space shuttle enters the bay of the rotating space station, the scene is almost identical to when the Millenium Falcon enters the Death Star. The first scene takes place in a desert, and the next on a blindingly white set.  Here are some of Goethe's words on borrowing. They are taken from   urlLink Conversations with Eckermann  , 18 January 1825:   Walter Scott used a scene from my  Egmont , and he had a right to do so; and because he did it well, he deserves praise. He has also copied the character of my Mignon in one of his romances; but whether with equal judgement, is another question. Lord Byron's transformed Devil is a continuation of Mepistopheles, and quite right too. If, from the whim of originality, he had departed from the model, he would certainly had fared worse. Thus, my Mephistopheles sings a song from Shakespeare, and why shouldn't he? Why should I give myself the trouble of inventing one of my own, when this said just what was wanted? Also, if the prologue to my  Faust  is something like the beginning of  Job , that is again quite right, and I am again to be praised rather than censured.

      Saw   urlLink 2001: A Space Odyssey   on the big screen last night, courtesy of  urlLink the Music Box  (which has a cool geeky  urlLink info page  on the film print). It must have been quite the phenomenon in 1968, and it has stood up to 34 years of technological development amazingly well. Of course, there is some irony that in 2002 we are still marvelling at pictures of space stations rather than flying there on business trips, but nevertheless, Kubrick's vision is sound, if a bit druggy towards the end.  Samuel Beckett said that "every word seems an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness", and Kubrick seems to agree. The long stretches of almost blank screen and empty audio are almost an invitation to meditate on the images.   The chaotic bagpipe-like sounds at the beginning of the movie remind me of the Heideggerian and holistic way in which Foucault begins the "Discourse on Language":   I would really like to have slipped imperceptibly into this lecture, as into all the others I shall be delivering, perhaps over the years ahead. I would have preferred to have been enveloped in words, borne way beyond all possible beginnings. At the moment of speaking, I would like to have percieved a nameless voice, long preceding me, leaving me to merely enmesh myself in it, taking up its cadence, and to lodge myself, when no one was looking, in its interstices, as if it had paused an instant, in suspense, to beckon to me. There would have been no beginnings: instead, speech would precede from me, while I stood in its path--a slender gap--the point of its possible disappearance.

       urlLink Here  is a very interesting description of two possible interpretations of Hegel's thought--a metaphysical view, and a post-Kantian interpretation. I have been conceptualizing Hegel in the metaphysical interpretation, but the post-Kantian interpretation is almost certainly more correct. Also, from an ontologically Idealist point of view, the two interpretations are, I think, identical. It is the writer of the article's perspective as an ontological materialist that creates the distinction in the first place.  A quotation from the article:    No sooner had Kant’s philosophy appeared then many objections were raised, among which were complaints about the apparently irreducible gap between the mind qua universal discursive intelligence and the mind as individual psychological reality.  I guess my question is: what gap?

      There's a great Nietzsche  urlLink article  in the  urlLink New Yorker  today. I was linked to it via the excellent weblog,  urlLink Art & Letters Daily . It is a book review of a  urlLink Nietzsche biography  by Rüdiger Safranski. I think that I can say with confidence that my own love affair with Nietzsche is long over, having called him "biographically pathetic" in a recent email. But he is still one of the most beautiful and strongest writers of German prose, and it took me years before I could read him without becoming sort of...emotionally possessed by his spirit. Here's a sample of what you might call "the strong stuff".     I have often asked myself whether I am not more heavily obligated to the hardest years of my life than to any others. As my inmost nature teaches me, whatever is necessary as seen from the heights and in the sense of a great economy is also the useful par excellence: one should not only bear it, one should love it. Amor fati: that is my inmost nature. And as for my long sickness, do I not owe it indescribably more than I owe to my health? I owe it a higher health—one which is made stronger by whatever does not kill it. I also owe my philosophy to it. Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit. Only great pain, that long, slow pain in which we are burned with green wood, as it were—pain which takes its time—only this forces us philosophers to descend into our ultimate depths and to put away all trust, all good-naturedness, all that would veil, all mildness, all that is medium—things in which formerly we may have found our humanity. I doubt that such a pain makes us "better," but I know that it makes us more profound.  —From  Nietzsche Contra Wagner , "Epilogue"

      Every so often you get burned. You get too confident, and life, nature, the negative, whatever you want to call it, has to bring you back down, and not necessarily gently. At least that's the way it works for me, a seemingly stereotypically idealistic Pisces. But it shows you that pain, whether physical, emotional or spiritual, is a necessary, inextricable part of life. You could call it the force of emotional gravity. In fact, paradoxically, it's necessary for human happiness or flourishing. Because it is merely an indication that the world is bigger than we are, that we can't stretch our minds completely around the cosmos. Would you really have it any other way?    Homer was wrong in saying: "Would that strife might perish from among gods and men!" He did not see that he was praying for the destruction of the universe; for, if his prayer were heard, all things would pass away....  — urlLink Heraclitus , fragment #43.

In that sense, blogging is the first journalistic model that actually harnesses rather than merely exploits the true democratic nature of the web. It's a new medium finally finding a unique voice.

      Several people I know are either vegetarians or "conscientious carnivores". Thoreau said that 'just as surely as the human species gave up cannibalism will it give up carnivorism' (That's not exactly right...I'm quoting from memory.)  Although I'm not quite jumping on the "Meat is murder" bandwagon just yet, I am convinced that there is a certain bad faith for the majority of civilized meat-eaters, like me, who are too sensitive to kill and clean their own meat. I suppose maybe that that is part of the attraction of hunting for some. Our culture enthusiastically hides the brutal facts of meat-eating from view, and I think that we should all wonder about whether this is optimal or not.  So although I like nothing better than a good steak, and could probably never give up meat entirely, I do give vegetarians credit for an interesting and provocative moral stance.

      This post is in response to  urlLink Jan's , below.   I do have reasons for putting Schopenhaur to the left of Nietzsche, but you could also think of those labels as arbitrary, as unrelated to the political left and right. But I (currently) do think of Platonism as more advanced than Aristotelianism (think of it in spiral dynamics terms), and therefore more "progressive" and therefore more advanced, and therefore further to the left, but that's just my own personal shorthand. I am much less sure of that than of my basic distinction of the two Goetheanisms.  I'm going to try to restate that whole post in plainer language.   Plato is an idealist. (If you saw the  excellent  movie  Iris , you saw a good example of a Platonic idealist.) When he talks about concepts like love, or justice, or goodness, he believes that these abstractions actually exist as entities in themselves. These are known as the Platonic Forms. Aristotle believes that forms exist, too. But he thinks that they only exist to the extent that they are exemplified by objects or beings. That is, the form "love" is composed of individuals' feelings or expressions of love.  Nominalism is the philosophy that Aristotle tended towards, that abstractions only exist insofar as they exist in concrete examples of these abstractions. I called Plato an essentialist, but anti-nominalist might be more accurate.  I want to use the analogy of Plato's and Aristotle's views on the forms to describe two different ways of thinking about spirit.  I bnelieve that Goethe inspired a generation of German thinkers to think about spirit and the world in evolutionary terms. These thinkers, the German Idealists, included Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, Heine, Schopenhaur, Nietzsche, Freud, etc.   The philosophical dogma is that these thinkers were decisively influenced by Kant. They were, but this does not explain the emphasis on evolution and development that all of these thinkers share and which I believe constitutes their genius. Kant certainly did not emphasize development in his philosophy; quite the opposite. I believe that they were decisively influenced by Goethe, and I hope to present textual evidence to this end.  But it's clear to me that these Goethean thinkers fall into two camps: nominalists of the spirit and anti-nominalists. Schopenhaur actually believed that his "Will to Live" was the fundamental force that the cosmos was composed of. He was therefore a spiritual anti-nominalist. Nietzsche criticized Schopenhaur in "The Gay Science" for believing in "one will". To Nietzsche, who saw himself as a student of the Enlightenment rather than a follower of Romanticism, this belief in "one will" was mystical unscientific nonsense. Emerson, who Nietzsche admired, had the idea of the oversoul which shows that he follows Schopenhaur on this issue.   The interesting question for me is whether Goethe was closer to Schopenhaur or Nietzsche on this question.

      OK, I guess I need some clarification. I understand where you're going with the 2 wings of Goetheanism, but which is Schopenhaurian and which is Nietzschean? It seems that your comparison of Schopenhaur to Emerson and your own approach to spirit would lead me to believe this as the "left" school of thought, more liberal (?)  but maybe I'm missing your definition of right and left.    You also say that Schopenhaur was more essentialist. Could you define essentialist for me?  I'd just like to get a handle on the vocabulary of the Goethean world.

      There is one rather major facet in my conception of Goethe that I need to find textual support for in Goethe's works. I have an impression of Goethe, especially in his later works, as believing in something similar to Emerson's conception of the Oversoul. But I can't think of a poem in which he confesses this.   This is a major facet because it distinguishes between the Schopenhaurian and Nietzschean strands of Goethe's legacy. Nietzsche had a more nominalistic, quasi-Aristotelian monism, while Schopenhaur had a full-blown quasi-Platonic monism. To use a term that is overly and poorly used today, Schopenhaur was more essentialist in his approach to spirit, as was Emerson, and as I tend to be. In the future, I may refer to these schools of thought as right and left Goetheanism, just as Gadamer is often called a right Heideggerian and Derrida a left Heideggerian.

Often, I wonder why some people tend to see the Internet as an elaborate waste of time, and others tend to see it as a revolution. A revolution in time-wasting? The idealistic among us want to think of it as more than that. The power is very great, the harnessing of that power is more difficult. It's as if we have been standing around looking at the first internal-combustion engine for five or ten years. "It's great, but what does it do?"...."I'm sure we can find  something  to do with it."

      Why the wacky name, "Goethea"? Well, if you know me, you know that I've been obsessed with (among others) the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. After almost a decade of this obsession, I think that I am coming to an understand of why Goethe has had such a tight hold on my mind. I believe that he had a view of the world that is neglected in a significant way by the English-speaking world. I have been trying to articulate what that view is for years, and I really haven't made much progress. I see this blog as just another notebook in pursuit of that goal.

      Apparently, I've established a weblog. The idea is that it is a better place to put my thoughts than in old emails that will sit in personal folders on various corporate servers until I switch jobs, at which time they will vanish into the digital ether.  Which makes me think: the digital world, although it is not equivalent to the actual world (a la the Matrix), is a good metaphor for it. In it, objects are composed of smaller entities (bits), until they are reduced to their component parts. All that is lost when a file is destroyed is organization. But organization is all that anything in the world is. Thus the McLuhanesque point that reality is simply information.

      In Friday's post, I said:   But this god would be nothing like the ethically good deity presented by the crescent religions.  By "the crescent religions". I meant the three religions that originated in the fertile crescent, which is composed of Mesopatamia and Palestine--Judaism, Christianity and Islam. From a google search, it appears that this is not the common usage that I thought it was. People seem to call them the monotheistic religions, or the Western religions, if anything. One might be tempted to call them religions of the book, but I think that this would be misleading when one considers the enormity of the Hindu scriptures.   Come to think of it, Islam didn't originate in Mesopatamia or Palestine, so my usage really doesn't make sense. I'm going to have to ask some of my historian friends what the collective term for these three religions is.

Before Plank time is preternatural-- so by the brightest minds we have been taught. What more miraculous than Personhood? What more unnatural than nature's Is? Why are there some things rather than no things? Incomprehensible! I feel a shock!  Envisage more than Anselm's point, look here: If we can think it, perhaps it is already,  or else we work in part to make it be.

       Is it possible to see the spirit of evolution as a god?  What kind of god would this be?  When one considers the emergence of living matter from inanimate matter, and of consciousness from living matter, and of self-consciousness from consciousness, the character of the spirit of evolution changes from the brute, dumb, almost malignant algorithm presented by contemporary neo-Darwinists like Gould, to a more progressive, positive spirit, perhaps even to a learning, growing, suffering entity. Although, of course, not an entity that exists independently of its components.  But this god would be nothing like the ethically good deity presented by the crescent religions.  This conception would be attacked as quaintly nineteenth-century progressivist by the vast majority of twentieth-century evolutionary theorists. Gould especially loved to ridicule the idea of evolution as progression, in fact he saw it as his duty to destroy the vestiges of Social Darwinism. But I think that there is an alternative to both Social Darwinism and flatland relativism.  If we are to ever recover--intellectually, ethically, culturally--from relativism--and I believe (with Nietzsche) not only that we need to, but that this is the task  par excellance  for contemporary intellectuals--evolution is surely the way out.  I read an article recently, but can't remember where, in which this kind of evolutionary speculation was described as Kubrickian. Yes, but also no: Kubrick inserted a MacGuffin, a black box, for what he couldn't put his finger on. That is, for what is driving evolution--the evolution of consciousness, and evolution beyond individual consciousness.  We must dare to go where Gould could not, and to where Kubrick could not, and describe what the spirit of evolution  must be  like.

      For someone who once thought that they would be a famous writer, it hurts to find a writer who expresses what one has felt better than one can. But it is dishonest to simply deny it. Maybe that is the arrogance of the artist: to believe, despite all, that one is truly creative. As with many arrogances, it is not unrewarded.

      Here's my one of my favorites from the  urlLink page of Wilber quotations . I have changed Wilber's idiosyncratic spelling.   "Maybe the evolutionary sequence really is from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a greater depth and greater consciousness and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of evolution, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity--a total embrace of the entire Cosmos--a Cosmic consciousness that is Spirit awakened to its own true nature. It is at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the scientific materialism story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane?"  -- A Brief History of Everything, p. 38-39

But he was a physicalist and materialist, as all contemporary normative scientists must be. And on those grounds he was not really part of the cultural solution I envision.  sz

      On the Emerson ListServe,  urlLink Richard Geldard  said something I liked:  As to the self, I have always liked RWE's image of the human being as a container of water, which after death is broken to spill its contents into the sea, there to merge with the whole. Thus, the so-called personal "self" is just a temporary embodiment of the greater Self, which, of course, pretty much takes care of the notion of the survival of the personality.

      Saw "Fellowship of the Ring" again Tuesday night. The movie portrays a world in which one seems very small in relation to the immense problems of the wide world. In which we walk among the ruins of a past time that seem larger than life. In Tolkein's world, it seems like we were born too late to struggle with the ultimate powers. Until we realize that our struggles are just as epic and just as momentous as those of the past.

      "I want to turn our common picture around. The judgment of beauty is not the result of a mysterious inference on the basis of features of a work which we already know. It is a guess, a suspicion, a dim awareness that there is more in the work that it would be valuable to learn. To find something beautiful is to believe that making it a larger part of our life is worthwhile, that our life will be better if we spend part of it with that work. But a guess is just that: unlike a conclusion, it obeys no principles; it is not governed by concepts. It goes beyond all the evidence, which cannot therefore justify it, and points to the future. Beauty, just as Stendhal said, is a promise of happiness. We love, as Plato saw, what we do not possess. Aesthetic pleasure is the pleasure of anticipation, and therefore of imagination, not of accomplishment. The judgment of taste is prospective, not retrospective; the beginning, the middle, but never the end of criticism. If you really feel you have exhausted a work, you are bound to be disappointed. A piece that has no more surprises left – a piece you really feel you know "inside and out" – has no more claim on you. You may still call it beautiful because it once gave you the pleasure of its promise or because you think that it may have something to give someone else. But it will have lost its hold on you. Beauty beckons." --Alexander Nehamas, " urlLink An Essay on Beauty and Judgment ", The Threepenny Review, Winter 2000.

      I love the Hegel quotation I posted on May 3rd. There is a Goethe quotation that I believe is equivalent: "The history of science is science itself". That is, science is not merely mankind's current solutions to problems that nature has posed. Instead, science is the whole development through time of mankind's interaction with nature, and discarded theories and hypotheses are just as significant a part of that history as are the theories that we currently hold dear. A tree is not merely its current form in the present, but is instead understood better as its entire development from acorn to maturity.  Positivists will dismiss my description as naive pre-Darwinian 19th-century optimism, or as Spencerian social darwinism. Instead, it is the inner aspect of Darwinism. Darwin described how evolution looked from the outside--the objective view. Hegel describes how it appears from the inside--the subjective view. And the inner, subjective appearance is just as valid, and just as important as the outer, objective view. Everything that exists has an inner reality. Every object is also a subject. And this fact does not create a mind-bending labrynth of subjectivities, as in Rorty's view, because all of the inner subjective realities emerge from a single subjectivity. Just as all objects are ultimately made of similar stuff, so inner reality is ultimately made of a single consciousness. Adding these irreducible perspectives together helps create what I referred to earlier as a modern cosmology which is at least as complex, as complete, and as beautiful as the views of Dante, Plotinus, Homer, Hesiod or Ovid, and therefore has no need of religious myth or scientific dogma.

      "Opinion considers the opposition of what is true and false quite rigid, and confronted with a philosophical system, it expects agreement or contradiction. And in an explanation of such a system, opinion still expects to find one or the other. It does not comprehend the difference of the philosophical systems in terms of the progressive development of the truth, but sees only the contradiction in this difference.   The bud disappears as the blossom bursts forth, and one could say that the former is refuted by the latter. In the same way, the fruit declares the blossom to be a false existence of the plant, and the fruit supplants the blossom as the truth of the plant. These forms do not only differ, they also displace each other, because they are incompatible. Their fluid nature, however, makes them at the same time elements of an organic unity in which they not only do not conflict, but in which one is as necessary as the other. And it is only this equal necessity that constitutes the life of the whole."   —Hegel,  The Phenomenology of Spirit , Preface. Translated by Walter Kaufmann.

       I was going to type in a long quotation by Ken Wilber, but googled the first few words, and of course, it's been entered already. It's  urlLink half-way down this page ,  urlLink here  with a geocities ad, and  urlLink here  with some graphics and a pop-up. Click on the one you find least offensive.  To me, it shows Wilber's transformation of traditional Buddhism from a rather pessimistic system--I've always interpreted the concept of Nirvana as meaning that existence should be escaped (a typically inaccurate Western view)--into something pretty affirming and positive. It is slightly other-worldly, but consider that in context, it comes as a prayer-like outpouring after 700 pages of intense philosophical reflection on consciousness in this world in the book  urlLink Sex, Ecology, Spirituality . In that context, it seems very appropriate.

      Yesterday, I was listening to NPR and heard a review for what sounded like a great new recording of Mussurgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition". The today, reading an article about Bethlehem Steel in Slate, I saw the phrase "dark satanic mills".  So obviously, I immediately thought of one of my most guilty pleasures, masters of 1970s "progressive" rock, Emerson Lake & Palmer. They recorded both "Pictures" and Blake's "Jerusalem". Mabe I'll get out my CDs and listen to them again. Their version of Jerusalem is a great track to try out a new stereo system on. Greg Lake's voice is a rich, powerful and godlike barritone and the production results in a pretty massive wall of sound. If there's a better recording out now, I'd love to here about it. It's one of the few poems steeped in Christian language that I can appreciate emotionally without wincing at the dogma it invokes (primarily because Blake mythology doesn't entail traditional Christian dogma).  And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountains green? And was the holy lamb of God On England pleasant pastures seen?  And did the countenance divine  Shine forth upon our clouded hills? And was Jerusalem builded here Among these dark satanic mills?  Bring me my bow of burning gold, Bring me my arrows of desire. Bring me my spear, oh clouds unfold! Bring me my chariot of fire!  I will not cease from mental fight, Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand, Till we have built Jerusalem In England's green and pleasant land!

       urlLink Robert Musil  linked to a neat  urlLink story  by Arthur C. Clarke. (The story has the added virtue of being very short--four pages.)  Thinking about the story, I realize that I would like to know much more about historical Buddhism than I do. (Please  urlLink email me  any Buddhist book recommendations.) Is Buddhism innately Pelagian?   By Pelagian, I refer to the heresy in Christian Church history that our life here on earth, rather than to "glorify god", in the typical formulation, is a process of "soul-building". That is, when we have suffered and learned enough from life in this world, we pass onto the next. This is an idea that has ben around as part of Christianity as well as many other religions.   Now that I get that question down on paper, I see that the answer is almost certainly yes.

      Well, for thought-proking, I sure as hell can't do any better than The Cellar BBS's  urlLink image of the day  today.    Non-violent protestors are one of the few saintly things in the world today (in all the positive senses that the term "saintly" connotes). They are an affront and a challenge to many forms of evil that afflict our world.   Violent protestors, like binLaden, get the opposite of what they want done. binLaden claimed he wanted a Palestinian state. What he has achieved is dead civilians in both Manhattan and Kabul and Palestine is farther away than ever. And a very patriotic America.  Non-violent protestors, like the ones in the picture, have a far greater chance of achieving their objectives than violent protestors. Or at least, of not making the opposite of their objectives come true, as is the case with binLaden.  And perhaps there is another, invisible, factor at work in their favor.

      With her, there was never anything to discuss. Or was there just never anything to discuss with me? Because I don't believe that she didn't want intimacy with anyone.  Then again, she was raised in such an oppressive, superficially-oriented, ambition-hungry environment, with a real fascist bastard for a father, what should I expect. Typical Anglican east-coast WASPs transplanted to the Midwest. A little Martha Stewart. No wonder she's such a wench.  It was my need to care for everyone, my faith that everyone is ultimately capable of love that did me in. That combined with her absolute childishness.  Look at what a saint I'm painting myself as. Well, I'm no saint. I don't have her side of the story.  I'd like to have her side. That's what I'm missing. I want completeness, wholeness, integration, to heal.   But like I said, with her there was never anything to discuss.

Bloom, a Shakespeare enthusiast, launched into his first statement before being asked a question.        Full Text:       Copyright Boston Globe Newspaper Apr 21, 2002  Globe correspondent Jenny Attiyeh conducted this interview.  Not long after plagiarism charges began swirling around the work of historians Stephen Ambrose and Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Globe spoke to Harold Bloom, 72, the Yale literary critic and author. Bloom, in town to speak at the Boston Public Library's annual Literary Lights dinner, wrote the influential book "The Anxiety of Influence," which argues that an inspired form of plagiarism lies at the heart of much, if not all, great literature. Bloom, a Shakespeare enthusiast, launched into his first statement before being asked a question.  A. [Shakespeare] is a sublime plagiarist. He is the genius of plagiarism. He got away with every thing he could get away with. Wherever he found a likely passage in Plutarch, he would just versify it. Wherever he found a chunk of anything that would be useful to his purposes, in it went. It was like a sort of endless stew in which everything and anything went. . . . So really, whether it be one of my own students or whether it be a distinguished or popular historian or whoever, I cannot get excited about accusations of plagiarism. It is the most normal activity of literary production.  Q. Is that true of Stephen Ambrose and "The Wild Blue," as well, that he's not really doing anything wrong?  A. I cannot say that I'm familiar with either the name or the work!  Q. Why do you think plagiarism became a sin in the academy, considering what you have said? How did this develop as an accusation?  A. My dear, when you consider what has happened to the American academy, we don't have academies anymore! We don't have universities. We have what I would call media-versities. There are no standards whatsoever. All cognitive, all aesthetic standards have vanished in the study of the humanities. I would think that inspired plagiarism is greatly preferable to the endless nonsense that goes on in what used to be the academic world.  Q. How would you define the term plagiarism? Does it include intentional or unintentional borrowing of someone else's work?  A. I wouldn't define plagiarism, because, as I say, it's the same thing as literature! Let me quote my great hero, Ralph Waldo Emerson: "The originals are not original!" That is from his superb essay called "Quotation and Originality."  Q. Your defense of plagiarism makes me think perhaps that we have no original thoughts.  A. Well, there are figures who come along and so subsume our available stock of reality and of language, Shakespeare above all, so that after Shakespeare, no one can be original! And so Shakespeare himself was not original.  Q. Have you ever done it [plagiarized someone]?  A. I'm very idiosyncratic and eccentric! To the best of my knowledge, I have not done it. On the other hand, I am scandalously overproductive; I have turned out 26 books and perhaps a thousand separate pieces. I hope I have never done it, but I wouldn't be prepared to stand before a firing squad and insist I have never done it!  Q. Has anyone ever plagiarized you?  A. I don't follow such things, so I would not know. But . . . I am considered to be so "way out" that it's not likely that anyone would try.

       "But what none of the first-tier memes can do is fully appreciate the existence of the other memes. Each of the first-tier memes thinks that its worldview is the only true perspective. It reacts negatively if challenged; it lashes out, using its own tools, whenever it is threatened. Blue order is very uncomfortable with red impulsiveness and orange individualism. Orange individualism thinks blue order is for suckers and green egalitarianism is weak and woo-woo. Green egalitarianism cannot easily abide excellence and value rankings, big pictures, hierarchies, or anything that appears authoritarian, and thus green tends to lash out at blue, orange, and anything post-green. Folks, let me put it bluntly: any first-tier meme will prevent world peace."  --Ken Wilber,  Boomeritis , p. 28-29.

      I can't get over how amazing and unique Stuart Davis' songs are.   Here are some lyrics from  urlLink this page .  Ladder [  urlLink mp3  ]  I've got brains like antique floors I built each one on the one before  I use all three  but they don't agree   One of them wants to love you another one would love to club you  my natures  move like glaciers   The fish became a lizard  The shrew became an ape  Will the ape become an angel? The higher that we climb the more the ladder sways   I'm the bastard child, the one who got  the head of Einstein and the soul of Pol Pot  No compassion, but I can split the atom   Better give me a microscope for a different eye  Better give me a telescope for the inward sky  And a ladder leading up from Eden  (Refrain)  If Ramana Maharshi  came from clay there's more to evolution than a little DNA   Cut off the moorings to the inward Ark aiming it into a question mark   Mmmm fish became a lizard  shrew became an ape  will the ape become....  Ramana Maharshi came from clay there's more to evolution than a little DNA

      I've been listening to the Stuart Davis CDs I bought at the concert. Unfortunately but obviously, the studio CDs aren't nearly as entertaining as seeing Stuart in perform live. Amusingly, the CDs sound a little like "Contemporary Christian Music", but only because both that genre and Stuart's songs are poppy and emphasize the lyrics much more than most pop music. But the lyrics are often explicitly non-Christian.  Everybody wants to taste A little something carbon-based. Sex is proof the Holy Ghost Crawls around in stuff that's gross. (Note the pun--"gross" refers to both yucky stuff and the Buddhist gross realm of the visible.) So I've been listening to contemporary anti-Christian music. What could be better?

       urlLink New article by Camille Paglia , the love of my life, in, of all places, the very right-wing FrontPage Magazine. The article is about the recent debate between Andrew Sullivan and Richard Goldstein at the New School.  Paglia's choice to be published in a hysterically conservative magazine is an odd one, but the good thing is that it will alert conservative readers to the fact that they need to choose between the libertarian and the authoritarian wings of conservativism. Paglia's explicit support of "the transgendered", as she puts it, should show readers the difference between her civil libertarianism and FrontPage's typically regressive authoritarian politics.

He doesn’t answer that question but continues: “She was very pretty, very sweet and very funny.

      Is the universe winding down, as the 2nd law of thermodynamics of classical Newtonian physics has it?  Or is it "winding up", as one might conclude by looking at the record of the gradual diversification and complexification over time of the evolutionary record?  Or are both processes somehow always at work simultaneously?  From  urlLink an interview with chemist Ilya Prigogine :    OMNI     Aren't there aspects of your theory that defy the laws of thermodynamics?   Prigogine     No. On the contrary, they show only that the meaning of the laws near equilibrium and far from equilibrium are different. Near equilibrium you always go to the most banal, the most uniform state. The general idea of classical physics is, we progress toward the running down of the universe. This may be true to some extent for the universe as a whole. But at the moment it's a very difficult question because we don't know the relation between entropy and gravitation.  What we see here on Earth is just the opposite of entropy. Instead of going to heat death, we see successive diversification. And so, in spite of the fact that the second law is probably satisfied, we are not going toward equilibrium, because this stream of energy comes to us finally from the stars, the galaxy, and so on. It ultimately originated in the big bang or whatever  -- the original presence in the universe.

      Actually, what I have been struggling for, the creation of a viable, honest contemporary spirituality, is not that difficult to define. The task is to see worth in each thing, without exception. Everything is here for a reason. Obviously, I don't mean that in a mythic, supernatural, moralistic way. Everything is here for  reason, but not only do we not know what that reason is, the reason doesn't even  exist  fully. The point to existence evolves along with the evolution of existence itself. This is what I call "holistic spirituality", and is a task for a lifetime. To see the necessity of every person, every minor thing, every action, however seemingly stupid, minor, violent or hideous. This seems to be similar to Nietzsche's Dionysian ideal. (You mean that ideal that he had a hard time living up to? Yeah--that one.) Which makes sense, since both his and my spiritual ideal is Goethe.  I think that what is necessary for this form of consciousness is a deep, abiding trust in and love for existence, below the superficial everyday ups and downs of emotions.    So, waiting, I have won from you in the end: God's presence in each element. ~g

      If you think a blog inspired by Goethe is obscure, check out  urlLink Gena Lewis's blog of Hölderlin translations .  Hölderlin was sort of the anti-Goethe. After the early Sturm und Drang years of Werther and Prometheus, Goethe took on a classical, stately, almost Olympian character. Goethe was blessed with many talents. Chicks dug him. Sort of a golden child. Hölderlin on the other hand, was sort of a combination of van Gogh and Emily Dickinson. A tragic, haunted soul from the beginning, he was always poor and was committed to a mental institution at the age of 36. Unfortunately, Goethe was totally unable to appreciate Hölderlin's talents. Hegel was also a friend of Hölderlin's and was racked with guilt at his inability to help him. I don't know whose translation of my favorite Hölderlin poem "To the Fates" this is:  A single summer grant me, great powers, and A single autumn for fully ripened song That, sated with the sweetness of my Playing, my heart may more willingly die.  The soul that, living, did not attain its divine Right cannot repose in the nether world. But once what I am bent on, what is Holy, my poetry, is accomplished:  Be welcome then, stillness of the shadows’ world! I shall be satisfied, though my lyre will not Accompany me down there. Once I Lived like the gods, and more is not needed.

      A movie called " urlLink Derrida " will be playing in Chicago on 8 November. I'll be there! DERRIDA is a complex personal and theoretical portrait of the internationally renowned French philosopher, Jacques Derrida. Best known for generating a movement known as "deconstruction", Derrida's radical rethinking of the founding precepts of Western metaphysics has profoundly influenced the fields of literature, philosophy, ethics, architecture and law, inalterably transforming the intellectual landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.  Produced with Derrida's full cooperation and consent, the film is the most ambitious cinematic project ever undertaken with a world-class philosopher. Initiated by Amy Ziering Kofman, who studied with Derrida at Yale in the 80's, and co-directed by Kirby Dick and Ziering Kofman, DERRIDA is neither a conventional film biography nor a primer on his thinking. Rather, in the spirit of Derrida's own writing, the film investigates the concept of biography itself and explores the nature and limitations of the cinematic form in addressing philosophical thought.  Through the interlacing of rare verite footage of Derrida in his private life with his reflections on deconstruction, violence, the structure of love, the history of philosophy, and the death of his mother, the film raises questions about the relations between the public and the private, the personal and the theoretical, the biographical and the philosophical, becoming a rich and moving meditation on both Derrida himself and the themes that haunt and inspire his work.  Directed by Kirby Dick ("Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan Supermasochist", "Chain Camera") and Amy Ziering Kofman (Producer, "Taylor's Campaign"), with an original score by Oscar winning composer, Ryuichi Sakamoto ("The Last Emperor", "Taboo," "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence").

Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

      Someone emailed me and asked my opinion on "how is Hegel's philosophy useful in a modern context?"  Hegel has been very useful to me in creating my own vision, but there are many (philosophers even) who do not find Hegel useful at all.   There are some superficial ways in which Hegel contributed to the contemporary vision, and some more profound ways. Walter Kaufmann listed some of the superficial ways in his book  Goethe Kant and Hegel . One example is that he taught us to look at a proposition, or an argument, or an artwork in the context of its origin, its end, and its purpose, rather than to look at it as a timeless, decontextualized entity.  But in a more profound (and "fuzzy-minded") way, one can see all of existence as emerging, as developing, as evolving. Both the individual, and the group, and the world evolves. And this evolution is not the intellectually or existentially trivial type that is described by most scientistic Darwinists. Rather than the nihilistic survival of the most boring that Gould portrayed evolution as, for example, existence   simply tends to evolve or develop  . And this develoment does not stop with contemporary man. We have farther to go.   Further, mind is developing, and minds develop at diferent rates. The differences between minds is often what produces conflict. Therefore, one can see conflict (whether violent, intellectual, cultural, etc.) as differences between people who are acting equally  appropriately  and  ethically , but from different frames of reference, different perspectives, different stages of development. Rather than the Christian/Medieval outlook of the world as conflict between Good and Evil, Hegel saw conflict as understandable differences of values. Conflict between different stages along the same path.  Further, unlike scientistic or moralistic views of existence, Hegel's Idealism allows for the legitimacy of these opposing conceptions--egoism, moralism, scientism, relativism. They are earlier stages (ancient, medieval, renaissance, Enlightenment), and thus appropriate to that stage of development. Therefore, to the moralist, the Hegelian is wrong, but to the Hegelian, the moralist is acting appropriately.  To Hegel, every stage of development was absolutely necessary. Seedling, plant, fruit, seed. Similarly, no aspect of life is worthless. No perspective is irrelevant. Quite a different perspective than the typically dualistic moral conception.   Even further, I believe that Hegel was somehow influenced by Eastern religion. Hegel posited  Geist  as the ultimate reality, the single mind of which our separate minds, our seperate selves, are mere individuated parts. And it is  Geist  that is developing through the development of each of our individual selves. As we pass into self-consciousness, it is  Geist  that is becoming self-conscious.  I think that Hegel saw the world, and the individual, as ontologically developmental. As becoming, rather than being. This is not easy to grasp, and Hegel's writing style obscures. (That's why I tend to recommend Goethe instead. Not that he's easy to grasp, but at least he's clear.)  But I believe that you have to be at a certain cognitive level before you can  want  to see all aspects of the world as necessary, right, ethical, and correct. That's why many (most?) professional philosophers are quite happy being totally ignorant of Hegel's vision. The moralistic and scientistic views of the world are incapable of grasping a holistic view.  In short, Hegel's vision is in my opinion so beautiful, so superior to the relativistic or materialistic or the moralistic visions, that it's truth value is almost secondary in importance.

      My birthday this year is a pretty dark day.  My thoughts on the war:  Hussein is evil, but there is no Iraq/Al Qaeda link. We can expect one to be manufactured presently.  The utter failure of the Bush Admin to create a coalition will have devastating results for the future of international relations. That the administration won't listen to Bush I, whose friends are writing pointed op-ed pieces in the NYT, is astonishing. For the nations of the world to depose Hussein would be a great good. But for the US and the UK to invade Iraq makes us the aggressors. We alone have taken on the mantle of the imperial power, the colonialists, the policeman of the world. Those who want to attempt a worldwide Pax Americana have won in DC. But the American people  don't want the job . They never asked for it. It was foisted on them without a vote by Richard Perle, who has allegience to Israel. The American people won't support invading country after country, especially when the consequences, in the form of terrorism, occur. The result of this insanity can only be disaster. Bush's ear must be given to someone with a little sense or wisdom or knowledge of history. Otherwise, we face annihilation.

I have two answers. One is  urlLink  Savitri  .  The other is that, following  urlLink  Jean Gebser  , I believe that civilizations go through stages. It is likely that certain poetic genres are more appropriate to the genius of each stage than other genres. Cultures at the mythic stage seem to excel at epic (The  Torah ,  Gilgamesh , Homer, Virgil, Dante, Milton). Cultures at the rational stage favor scientific and philosophical treatises (Locke, Hobbes, Hume, Darwin). Cultures at the relativistic stage favor lyric poetry (Wordsworth,  et al ) and the novel. Cultures at the integral stage seem to prefer hyperlinked, interwoven, sphere-shaped screed-communities like the one you are reading.

      As conservatives used to be fond of saying, the US should not be the policeman to the world.   I agree. But I believe that the world does need a policeman. E.g., Serbia, Rwanda, Uganda, Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti.  So, who?   The UN would be the answer, if it were capable of bilateral force.  I believe that the answer is an expanded, empowered NATO.   Ultimately, nations will have to give up sovereignty in order to solve global problems.  Perhaps a confederation would be a good approach.  Someone needs to write a global constitution.

      So is it fair to say that conservatives believe that fetuses are human, but that gays are not?

      Matt Drudge thinks that he's today's Walter Winchell. He's actually closer to a combination of J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy.

      As odd as it is to hear myself typing this (we have exchanged verbal blows in the past), my thoughts on Bush and the war correspond precisely to  urlLink Stirling Newberry's . That is, the only hope for the future credibility of the US with the world is to prosecute Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Perle for lying to the nation and for war crimes.

      As much as I hate to link to the man with a  urlLink grudge : Top White House officials expressed anger after TIME magazine detailed the location of Vice President Dick Cheney's secret bunker...  One White House officials (sic) fumed Monday night: "TIME magazine would have revealed secret the location of Anne Frank, if they knew it." Can you  imagine  the outrage that would have resulted from a Clinton administration official comparing Al Gore to Anne Frank? It would have been news for a week.

       Quiz time   What do the following thinkers have in common?  (Highlight the space below the list with your cursor for the answer.)  * The Buddha * Plato * Plotinus * Goethe * Hegel * Schelling * Emerson * Eckhardt Tolle   They all could be called "secular mystics"---they came to mystical conclusions based on logic and experience, not through any religious authority. This is notably true of Tolle, who, despite his Krishnamurtian approach, denies any religious association, and Plotinus. Others, especially Emerson, had a more inclusive approach, and were influenced by religious mystics both Christian and Hindu.   urlLink Write to me  with any additions to my list.

       urlLink Here , I wrote that Stuart Davis is the poet of Ken Wilber's integral philosophy. Here are some more match-ups that I came up with:     socrates     aristophanes       plato     sophocles        aristotle     euripides       plotinus     michelangelo       augustine, aquinas     dante       vico     petrarch       machiavelli, bacon     shakespeare   >    luther, calvin     milton, donne       voltaire, diderot     pope       rousseau     blake,wordsworth, etc.       kant, schelling     goethe       hegel     heine       marx     dickens       emerson, thoreau     whitman, dickinson       nietzsche     kafka, mann, musil       freud     lawrence       james     frost       whitehead     stevens       aurobindo     aurobindo       heidegger     rilke, hesse      wilber     davis      This is not meant to diminish or to highten the reputation of any poet, but to try to notice which major philosophies have been put into poetry, and which haven't.

       And what is compassion, if not an exercise in moral equivalence?    In the  New Republic , Leon Wieseltier examines the warblogger's ethic and comes up a little empty.    urlLink Most of the right-wing heresiologists who scream "moral equivalence" at the sight of an inconvenient similarity intend mainly to shore up their own thinking or to shut down the thinking of others. (They had no compunction about comparing Saddam to Stalin.) And what is compassion, if not an exercise in moral equivalence? The care that we feel for people other than ourselves is the result of regarding us all, the subjects of our concern and ourselves, under a single and highly general description, which is the description of the human. There is no way to pursue justice without believing in the moral equivalence of all men and women. The idea that small-town Americans can bring democracy to small-town Iraqis is also a version of this belief. But everyone has their preferred equivalences, just as everyone has their preferred corpses.

      I also smoked a cigar at lunch today, a Fire mini corona. Fantastic! A little tiny cigar (4 x 40) that packed a flavorful punch. The big ones must be amazingly full flavored. I think I'll buy a bunch of these.

       The Mystery of the Oakbrook Gurudwara   I was looking for a place to meditate while on my lunch break at work. I remembered that there was supposed to be a Sikh temple, called a gurudwara, in Oakbrook. So I looked up the address on the net and drove off looking for it. On Forest Gate Road in Oakbrook, there is only the Oakbrook Park District (1450 Forest Gate) and a luxurious subdivision (from 1 to 75 Forest Gate). A mail lady was stopped there, so I got out and asked her where 1500 Forest Gate Road is. She says: "1500 Forest Gate Road doesn't exist! But we get mail for them all the time! We have to send it back."  Someone must have planned to build the  urlLink Oakbrook Gurudwara , perhaps where the Oakbrook Park District is now located.  Or maybe a  urlLink sadhu  lives in the large, partially-forested park to the north of Forest Gate Road...  Zen teachers  urlLink recommend  noticing the dream-like qualities of existence, but I wasn't expecting to notice the mystery-novel-like moments.

      Hey, if any fellow Wilberians happen to read this, I have a question. On the inside front cover of  urlLink  Integral Psychology  , it says: "This is a condensed version of  System, Self, Structure , which has previously only been available as Volume Four of Wilber's  Collected Works "   Well, I'm looking for this on Amazon, and I can't find it.    I found  urlLink this , which  urlLink  is   volume four, but according to the  urlLink Table of Contents , that contains  Integral Psychology , not  System, Self, Structure . A  urlLink Google Search  comes up empty. So does  SSS  exist? Or was it a twinkling in the bald guy's eye? I want the full treatment!  Email me at: goethean at yahoo dot com.

      Went to Louisville this weekend. Had a good time. It's a surprising cool city. Highlights: betting at Churchhill Downs, the Speed Art Museum. Was surprisingly unsuccessful in finding live bluegrass music. Funniest moment was the hotel desk clerk asking me if bluegrass music was different than Blues.

      Was reading Aurobindo's  The Life Divine  last night, and it's fantastic. Will probably post some choice quotations soon.  For the past few months, I've been reading the first volume of Eknath Easwaran's  The Bhagavad Gita for Everyday Living . It's quite different for me to read truly inspirational literature rather than intellectual. More of an imperative to act than to think.

       The Kosmos In Sixteen Lines        Lyrics from Stuart Davis’ song, “ urlLink Anesthesia Necrophilia ”, from the album   urlLink The Late Stuart Davis      My interpretation     you cracked that void    The eternal universal Self, or Spirit, created the cosmos by becoming form, thus losing its previous perfectly spiritual existence.      and let it leak     such a pervert    Einstein said, “God does not play hide and seek with the universe.” However, Spirit did perversely disguise itself as an individual awareness which is inside a human body-mind. (That’s you.)      playing hide and seek     &nbsp;   &nbsp;     who wandered off from home    God ate the map. That is, it deliberately stopped knowing that it was God. That’s why you think that you are a merely individual human body-mind. In Christian theology, the act of God emptying himself of divinity to become a human being is called  kenosis .      and ate the map     now beg yourself    Deep down, all of your struggles—for pleasure, money, power, love—are disguised attempts to regain your lost divine heritage. In order to do so, you must genuinely submit to Spirit, to the All. You must overcome the individual, selfish ego, and painfully watch it be destroyed, by consistently doing the opposite of what it wants. Put differently, you must destroy the seperate, individual self, which is what you incorrectly take to be your true self, in order to fully become what is actually your true self—universal awareness.  Spirit. God.      to take you back     &nbsp;   &nbsp;     spitting out white noise    If you created the entire cosmos, then you created all of the wonders and mysteries in it. “What unfolds” refers to evolution and development, which is what all activity and investigation ultimately is. Because you are Spirit, in any pursuit you are paradoxically both the one hiding the answers and the discoverer of those answers.      digging those black holes     shove that shovel     into what unfolds...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;     is but a laugh attack    And yet, if we are actually the universal eternal Self, then we don’t exist in time and space, and thus, in the absolute sense, this whole grand cosmic story of creation and destruction, of involution and evolution, never actually happens. All that ultimately exists, to use the title of a recent book, is “the simple feeling of being.”   The story of your birth, life, death, and all of the melodramatic struggles of your individual body-mind, the entire universe of apparances—these are all merely waves on the ocean of consciousness, clouds floating across the sky of awareness, fleeting thoughts in the universal Mind.  Life is not the tragedy that it feels like when you are trapped on the inside—it is a divine comedy when viewed from the perspective of eternity, which is the true perspective, since your true self is eternal.     about the fact it never happens     as the cause of all confusion     is the clues are all illusion

      I was looking at a map of the US yesterday and came up with a list of favorite contemporary writers and the georaphical area that they are associated with.      Bloom   New Haven, Connecticut      Dillard   Tinker Creek, Virginia      Helprin   Hudson Valley, New York      Paglia   Philadelphia, Pennsylvannia      Jim Harrison   Northern Michigan      Berry   Henry County, Kentucky      Stuart Davis   Minnesota; Colorado      Wilber   Boulder, Colorado      Pirsig   Bozeman, Montana      MacLean   Montana     Feuerstein   Northern California      Easwaran   SF Bay area, California       Snyder   Sierra Nevada Mnts, California              Mostly, these are not urban places. Do I enjoy rural authors (whether despite or because of my suburban location), or do great authors tend to be inspired by rural locations? It would be interesting to map a longer list of authors and see which areas are covered.
