      I'm not sure if I will ever feel comfortable in the first few minutes after I've shagged a client.  When it's all over, and we are both in a strange state of fear and euphoria.. it never seems right.   The man always seems to be worrying about something-- his wife, his girlfriend, anything.. I recognise that he may not want to cuddle with me, but the way he pushes me away worries me sometimes.  I don't care what the problem is.. once he pays me, I provide the services he wants..   I spent Friday night with a footballer.. a bit famous, I suppose.. let's just call him G.B.  With England out on Thursday, G.B. rang me late to try to arrange a 'date' on Friday.  I told G.B. I would do anything he wanted for 5000 quid.  For that kind of price, I am usually willing to let them put it anywhere.  These days, I can usually just set my price.  Like the spoilt footballer I thought he was, he didn't quibble.  No problems..   Actually, I quite enjoyed it.  He had the most wonderful bum.. clearly a footballer..   But once we had finished shagging, when we first lay next to each other, covered in sweat and other body fluids-- G.B. began to get worried.  He said that he couldn't let his wife find out about this (he has risked his family for a shag in the past).  Sort of ruined the moment for me.    I suppose it is hard to complain when I was the one getting paid.

      I am no expert with computers.. and I am pretty impressed that I got this bloody blog to work.  So I can share my life.  I don't even really know why I am doing this.. suppose I figure it can be my outlet.  But I want to tell you all (my future fans) that all names (including my own) have been changed to protect the 'innocent'.  I am writing this all for me.. the specifics are no one else's business.

      I recently attended a London premiere of Michael Moore's new film Fahrenheit 9/11.  It was an experience.  A bit of a hodge podge of semi-famous people.  An interesting film.  Its a pity he is such a fat man.  However, my week has been far more interesting.  A few days ago, I had been walking through the High Street Kensington tube station while listening to my new Ipod (G.B. bought it for me)-- and I passed across, of all things, a tube worker named "Howard".    A few seconds of watching him made me so wet that I began to drip.  Yes, like that.  It was as if the whole tube station became very humid suddenly.  It has been a while since a man has made me feel that way.  So I decided to make his day.  I grabbed him, gave him a good look in the eyes, and licked my lips.  If I remember correctly (I was pissed), I told him I wanted to fuck him until he couldn't stand anymore.  He took me into a back room in the tube station and locked the door.  I don't even know why I did it.  It's not as if he was the sexyest bloke.  He was just a short Asian.  But the wine I drunk was telling me to give it a go.   I dropped his pants to the floor and dropped to my knees.  He had one of the smallest cocks I have ever seen.  It was tiny.  Couldn't have been more than 5 centimeters long.    I tried to give him head but actually had difficulty.  I couldn't get it far enough into my mouth to swirl my tongue around it.  (I suppose that is more than you needed to know).  I tried my best but began to get very very frustrated.  Just as I tried to determine my next "move", he came.  I couldn't believe he could fit that much in there!  It seemed like nearly half a litre!  Although I deflected most of it before it entered my mouth, a very small amount touched my tongue.  It was perhaps the worst thing I have ever tasted.  I'm not sure what it was, but my only guess is it was affected by Curry or Kebab.  At that point I had to leave.  I was disgusted.  Once I wiped my face, I grabbed my bits and left.  As I shut the door of that back room, he was still standing there half naked.    I hopped on the first District line train out of there and decided to change at Earl's Court.  I couldn't bear to see that tiny penis again.  It has burned an image in my mind, and I don't think I will forget it anytime soon.  I would try to contact the world record people (have they got one for most petite penis?).. but I only know his first name.  Bugger!  Lessons learned: (1) Asian men have small penises (I may need more firsthand knowledge to confirm this) (2) Curry and Kebab make men taste like shite (3) It was hot to hook up in a tube station.  Will have to try this again.  Any takers?
