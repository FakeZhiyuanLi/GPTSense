      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is my last day&nbsp;in the Substance Abuse program at the VA hospital.&nbsp; It has been an enlightening, humbling experience.&nbsp; Carl Jung said that the only way out of the vortex of addiction was through spirituality.&nbsp; As Doctors and perhaps even as people the idea of spirituality is connected too closely with Religion.&nbsp; Dan Costello is one of the CSWs here...he's the supervising addiction therapist.&nbsp; A more comfortable, loving, wiser person is difficult to encounter I imagine.&nbsp; He began today with a breakdown of the 4 aspects of an individual.&nbsp; The Physical, the emotional, the mental, and the spiritual.&nbsp; Within the population of drunks, crackheads, addicts...each is being sought to repair, reorganize, restore.&nbsp; We're removing the physical cravings and dampening the withdrawl of alcohol during detox.&nbsp; We're allowing them the security to duvulge their emotions, the pain, the past trauma that makes them to feel abandoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the greatest realization is that we're not human beings living a spiritual life...we are spiritual beings living a human life.&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is not within...it encircles us...connects us to all life, to God.&nbsp; I don't believe we can truly ascend as a society until we realize&nbsp;that&nbsp;God is within all of us...all of nature...and that the easiest way to feel that is through love.&nbsp; Religion is a community of belief but beyond that it is a manmade construct built to enstill fear and division between people.&nbsp; Religion is war.&nbsp; I have been raised as a Hindu...one of the oldest, most inclusive belief systems.&nbsp; It is tolerant and recognizes the existence of God in different states, forms,&nbsp;people.&nbsp; It endorses the concept of&nbsp;souls&nbsp;shifting through time.&nbsp; I am also not supremely qualified to preach this.&nbsp; I am only priveleged to make others aware that&nbsp;before we are Americans, before we are Christians, before we are black, before we are human...we are energy...the same energy that cannot be detroyed...that is weakened when divided.  &nbsp;&nbsp; The Attending physician is not here so I might call it an early day after lunch.&nbsp; I'm planning on some Sushi with Dan at a place he raves about.&nbsp; I need to do some reading and head over to "the Brook" (Stony Brook University Hospital).&nbsp; Not for professional reasons.&nbsp; Two days ago I was there for my annual physical which frankly was a joke.&nbsp; I was hoping I could get some lab work done as I've had Iron defficient Anemia for some time.&nbsp; No go...just vitals and a PPD (a screening test for Tuberculosis...still a scourge across much of the developing world).&nbsp; Anyway, while&nbsp; there I stopped into the cafe for lunch...the usual: a turkey wrap with veggies and mustard...ok, I did add some bacon too.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Far ahead of me on line was an attractive woman..she wore a white t-shirt poking out&nbsp;under a black V-neck sweater.&nbsp; Khaki pants hugged a fit, well proportioned&nbsp; body.&nbsp; She had short blonde hair, seemingly soft, flowing.&nbsp; I looked for her in the cafe...she sat alone with documents sprawled over the lunch table for 4, busily speaking on her cell phone...discouragingly it looked.&nbsp; I overheard her disputing the legitamacy of a bill...I was cogniscent of my manners and too distracted to really digest the Tuesday Times.&nbsp; After Sunday, it's the one I look most forward to thanks to the added science section.&nbsp; There was extra DNC coverage which was a must to ponder.&nbsp; I'll do so at length tomorrow.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hanging up the&nbsp;phone she looked over in mild exasperation.&nbsp; I smiled and asked if everything was ok.&nbsp; She talked about a credit card that was opened in her name without her knowledge and charges of $500 applied to the card.&nbsp; Apparantly a phone survey from a few weeks ago was implicated.&nbsp; I sympathized as she made another call.&nbsp; Once I finished my&nbsp;lunch,&nbsp;I looked down at the inner cap of the drink I had (some unsweetened Mint flavored tea...they were out of Vitamin Water) which read "There's no use in being pessimistic...it&nbsp;never works anyway".&nbsp; I approached her table and placed in front of her...telling her that I thought it applied.&nbsp; "Aaww...thanks" she crooned.&nbsp; I didn't mean it as a token of affection...I asked if I could sit down to which she smiled and sarcastically said, "No you can't...you can't sit down."&nbsp;&nbsp; We spoke small talk...it was her second day working in the office of the Surgical Oncology department...grad of SUNY Albany majoring in Psychology but hadn't pursued post grad due to a poor GED, living in neighboring Smithtown.&nbsp; She was surprised I was a Doc...pleased perhaps.&nbsp; We spoke about the importance of proper health care for veterans, her aspirations, life&nbsp;at&nbsp;"the Brook" etc.&nbsp; She was short of&nbsp;time for lunch and we parted amicably.&nbsp; I gave a thought to getting her number but I already knew where she worked and figured&nbsp;I'd pay a visit sometime...like later today.

      &nbsp; On most other Fridays, I would be arranging plans to meet up with George to hang out...not today.&nbsp; Over the last week, I've partied to excess leaving me slightly guilt ridden and quite strapped for cash.&nbsp; I've got a hefty American Express bill I have to take care eventually and I'll have to be rather monastic until next weekend.&nbsp; I worked along side Dr. T this morning seeing 3 patients with her.&nbsp; All increasingly sick...all with prior substance abuse histories, war stories and childhood trauma...amazing the similar themes that run through the lives of so many veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; I drive by and often see signs that read "We Support our Troops".&nbsp; Each time, I'm confused as to what this really means.&nbsp; Does it mean that we should blindly support the Commander in Chief?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean&nbsp;we should hope for&nbsp;and provide the best we can to our young soldiers?&nbsp; The latter is how I'd rather take it.&nbsp; That we should provide adequate funding for their sacrifice...the Bush administration did not support raising the compensation from $6,000 to $12,000 for soldiers killed in battle.&nbsp; That we should provide enough funding for their families...too many are currently living hand to&nbsp;mouth...having lost the second income, dollars are stretched thin thanks to unexpected extensions in service.&nbsp; Morale while strong at first can only crack when soldiers are kept longer than promised, when they are constantly under stress from an enemy that does not reveal itself,&nbsp; and when in a nation that views them as occupiers rather than liberators.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they return, are any truly unscathed?&nbsp; I would say no.&nbsp; Many are injured...burns, GSWs, amputees...the mental trauma perhaps more prevalant.&nbsp; Recent surveys show as many as 16 percent of returning soldiers suffer from symptoms of Depression and or PTSD.&nbsp; This is the time they need our support most...off the battlefield.&nbsp; Medically, financially, emotionally.&nbsp; I want an administration who supports our troops enough to only send them into harms way when ABSOLUTELY necessary.&nbsp; Not to send them in without an adequate coalition, not to divert them from the search for Osama Bin Laden, no to use them after drumming up false claims about the capabilities and purpose of the mission.&nbsp; Sigh.  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; I was a bit apprehensive thinking about going into work this morning...after essentially ditching out all of Friday to party with my newly arrived Italian friends.&nbsp; Still, I repeated the mantra..."Unconditional Self Assurance"...I took off because it was going to be a slow day...no&nbsp;big deal...man, I love the rationalization.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Michele called me and told me he (yes, that's Michael here) would be arriving at 4 PM.&nbsp; Swweeet, I thought...I'll pick him up, we'll be in the city (that is what we LIers deem as Manhattan) by happy hour for 2 nights of debauchery.&nbsp; I'm currently working at the VA Hospital in Northport helping treat veterans with substance abuse problems complete a 28 day treatment program.&nbsp; I'm a Psychiatrist...at least in training...in my second year of residency at SUNY Stony Brook.&nbsp; More on all that later.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway, I couldn't leave work until 4 and being 45 miles away from JFK, I had little time despite the fact that I like driving fast and have the car for it (a 350 Z roadster 6-speed).&nbsp; I take pride in the airport pickup and being he (also a huge autophile) had not seen my new ride, I was excited about the pickup doubly.&nbsp; Traffic on the Cross Island screwed me...I should have taken the Southern State...made it there a bit after 5 and was awaiting his call...at one point thought he may have already come and gone but as I continued to circle the Alitalia arrivals, he called...love the perfect pickup.&nbsp; We ended up driving to manhattan with one suitcase in the trunk and one in his lap...his family owns a company called Verri that makes spectacular mens clothing...come on, they're Italian.&nbsp; Suits to rival anyone, designs on the edge of sanity...I revel in my own metrosexuality.&nbsp; Michele is older than me...30 something with short salt and pepper hair, thin but taut, a former feather weight boxer with a passion for business and beautiful women.&nbsp; He'd getting admittedly sick of the long hours he puts in for his company&nbsp; though when he tells of trips to Tokyo and Kiev, my pity dissolves.&nbsp; Has ideas of retiring in 5 years, selling his shares and sailing the Mediterranean...wants me to join him.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We arrived at the Gershwin Hotel on 27th and Madison after many a curious look.&nbsp; Two dudes in a hot car on hot evening...with luggage in hand.&nbsp; He showered, I smoked and we strolled to the car on our way to Dukes ( a post work southern trash bar with too many TVs but enough orange leather to distinguish it from an Irish Pub.&nbsp; It's our thing...we have to start there...Jack and Cokes, apps and story trading about the lack of a good wingman.&nbsp; He left a message in the hotel for Simona...arriving from&nbsp;Boca Raton&nbsp;on said night...Simona, a cute blonde with an easy going, fun loving attitude.&nbsp; Sweet, engagable...she's working as an Au pair with some dysfunctional, anxiety ridden family whose father she calls her "house Daddy"...fucking yikes.  &nbsp; Prior to putting the beast into first, Michele noticed a flat out Goddess squatting to coax her reluctant and quite ugly Bull Dog named Nicole &nbsp;into walking further.&nbsp; Being both a dog lover and a cad, I could not resist stepping out to&nbsp;say anything.&nbsp; I said hello and told her her dog reminded me of mine...which immediately I knew was quite a stupid thing to say because mine is a pretty, lithe, active, affectionate yellow lab/boxer mix...Chini requires much elaboration.&nbsp; Oh Maria...oh oh...a striking, statuesque brunette with lightly bronzed skin and a body made to walk in lingerie.&nbsp;&nbsp; She deals Real Estate and I elaborate on my dream apt...close to the park, 2 BR, Terrace, parking and fireplace.&nbsp; I introduced her to Michele as I stroked Nicole...wishing it was her owner.&nbsp; As we winded down the conversation I asked for her number to "meet up with us later".&nbsp; "I would love to &nbsp;but I don't live alone, " she replied with a cocked head.&nbsp; "Well, if you change your mind sometime, give me a call (handing her my recently made business card)."&nbsp; She smiled, strolled away like a gazelle and yelled out "I might go out later, I'll call you!"&nbsp; She wouldn't but it had to be done.&nbsp; I have grown a thick skin regarding women and realize that if you swing at enough pitches, you'll atleast put a few in the gap.  &nbsp; Dukes was a cockfest...wall to wall...I just pulled&nbsp;up a few stools and flagged down a hooters chic look-a-like to get us 2 JCs.&nbsp; A pair later we decided to take a walk to Chango...a snazzy but&nbsp;"over" bar with great Margherita specials.&nbsp; Simona interrupted us to let us&nbsp;know she was at Dukes...She had the Italian look to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally beautiful, curvaceous and a clear understanding&nbsp;of how to wear&nbsp;jeans perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was pleased to be in a city amongst peers as opposed to the transplantable Americana of Boca.&nbsp; The rest of our evening was spent in the Meat Packing district which has turned into an absolute circus of nightlife.&nbsp; What once had an underground, undiscovered feel is now crawling with dwellers every evening.&nbsp; Developers, restaraunteurs, hotels, clubs...ubiquitous within the 5 block radius.&nbsp; Atleast the "Western Beef" is&nbsp;still selling wholesale priced chuck next door to&nbsp;Stella McCartney.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;to many guilt ridden, pricey jaunts and the natural charms of George and I, we've developed a pleasant rapport with quite a few gentleman who man the doors&nbsp;of a few places.&nbsp; Hence&nbsp;options are not a problem...and&nbsp;to be honest, it feels&nbsp;sweet to walk into such dens ahead&nbsp;of the masses. &nbsp;&nbsp; The next evening, we had dinner at the OG (Oriental Grill)...an open, small asian bistro off of Ave A...excellent all around...the dumplings especially.&nbsp; The only downside to dinner was the company.&nbsp; Michele decided to bring this girl Denia who works in his sample shop on Fashion Ave.&nbsp; Ignorant and stubborn, she decided to acuse me of simply "drugging" my patients...a ridiculously false generalization.&nbsp; I implored her to think of the severely psychotic patient, the plight of the suicidal patient, the one whose mania is ruining his relationships and work...what if her mother had such an affliction...where would she take her?&nbsp; These were irrelevant points in her mind and she could not intelligently address them.&nbsp; She mentioned that her beliefs were different "being a Muslim"..."Oh, that explains it," I said rolling my eyes.&nbsp; I could feel a surge of adrenaline, my heart rate and breath quickening as I prepared for verbal war.&nbsp; "So I guess you treat suicidal people by strapping explosives to them and promising Nirvana," I said dryly.&nbsp; Clearly inaccurate but appropriate for the moment.&nbsp; Her religous beliefs should not impact the medical treatment of others I explained...however I had crossed a boundary and she had to take a break with a cigarette...we cooled off and avoided each other the rest of dinner.&nbsp; I have no issue with arguiing when done intelligently and when favorable to the plight of the less fortunate.&nbsp; There have been some to say I will disagree simply for the sake of it but when I'm wrong, I'll admit it, when others are right, I'll agree.&nbsp; There are no wrong or right people, just right or wrong ideas. &nbsp; Following dinner, Michele, Simona and I went next door to Industry Food&nbsp;for a drink.&nbsp; Denia and her friend said their polite good byes and I wished her no hard feelings.&nbsp; Prior to walking into the bar, I struck up a conversation with a girl standing alone waiting for a friend.&nbsp; She was an educated looking brunette with a cute face.&nbsp; She was wearing an A-shirt with a layered, grassy printed skirt, tighter in the hips to illustrate a great ass.&nbsp; Thankfully her calves were not atrophied.&nbsp; Don't you hate that?&nbsp; To see a perfectly beautiful woman with no attention to her legs....just a shame.&nbsp; Allison...a lawyer, working on the prosecutorial side of the Enron case...very nice.&nbsp; We would join her friend later and speak in detail about her boyfriend's cocaine problem.&nbsp; He's an MD in Opthamology (one of the most difficult residencies to attain).&nbsp; They have been dating for 6 years.&nbsp; 6 YEARS!&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; Why do successful, beautiful women saddle themselves with men who are content to take them for granted for such an enormous period of time?&nbsp; This is flat out pathological and self-defeating.&nbsp; Simona is in the same boat, except hers is long distance on top of being long term.&nbsp; Just end this idiocy already.&nbsp; Michele told me the dude had been cheating on her for a long time...I suspect the MD had some liasons as well.&nbsp; I told her, the best advice I could give was to provide an ultimatum.&nbsp; If he did not check himself into some form of treatment, she would leave him.&nbsp; I also told her it was in her best interest to leave him regardless...that I had seen stagnant relationships waste too much youth.&nbsp; Her girlfriend thanked me as we left. &nbsp;&nbsp; I walked into work late...as usual.&nbsp; My attending was not present which sent a short burst of relief through me...always a good idea to arrive before your boss, period.&nbsp; No repurcussions were handed out...after all, I did let all&nbsp;know that I wouldn't be there&nbsp;on Fri.&nbsp; Unconditional Self Assurance...USA. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

        Over a weekend of variety...of work and play in different settings...the divisiveness of current American politics came to mind.   I couldn't do much on Friday as I left from the VA to go right to Stony Brook...I was on call from 8pm-8am there in the Psychiatric ER. It was a relatively slow night...among 6 patients that came in were a drunk woman found belligerent on the beach, a Mexican illegal alien feigning suicide while in jail for robbing a liquor store, an 8 year old black girl living with her adoptive family brought in for making a suicidal gesture after her crack-addicted bio mom cancelled a birthday visit for the second week in a row. Eventually all would be evaluated and sent home with a proper treatment plan. In a setting where I see the damage that dysfunctional families wreak on their dependants, it is discomforting to witness its repetition in theme and content. I would surmise to say that the overwhelming majority of patients I've seen in the Psych ER have encountered some familial rupture/abuse/neglect. The drumbeat however is not to bring attention to any of this...it is to stop "those Gays" from even attempting it.   Last week, Missouri ammended their own state constitution to prevent gay marriage thereby "protecting it" as an institution. I suppose that should stem the heavy infiltration of queers looking to settle in Kansas City. "They got some crazy little women there and I'm gonna...get me one." Someone has yet to explain exactly how the presence of two dudes living next door will affect them. Will they be subject to constant interior design scrutiny? Lack of power tools to borrow? Playing musicals too loud? God forbid you get the wrong catalogues...that could be damaging. Perhaps its the possibility of circle jerks or slip n slide parties without the famed yellow tarp. Most of the above is ridiculous...the gay community realizes that. It's us that doesn't. Of course it's true that gay men are proportionately less monogomous and for shorter periods of time when they are. But there is a significant portion that is not content with the high-risk lifestyle...that yearns for something legitimate in their own eyes. Love. Certainly you can entertain that love is not lost on heterosexuals exclusively. Gay men and women have been entering into and nourishing civil unions in a variety of states for several years. The stigma of having an inferior relationship in the eyes of government and religion compared to the trashy, abusive, booze hounding married couple down the block is a travesty. All of this ridiculous legislation is phrased to protect the insitution of marriage for a man and woman. We should look at it as the converse. Denying the right of two people to love, honor and cherish each other based on their sexual orientation. Why? Because they can't have children? No. My uncle and aunt and millions of others have been married without children by choice or not. Millions more have entered into 2nd or 3rd marriages...they haven't felt the need to procreate each time. Is it that kids raised by gays will be disadvantaged? Well, not because of their gayness. NO studies have shown children raised in such households to have anything other than the same angst and growing pains that all other teens do. And no...their sexual orientation has not been shown to be affected. The success and well being of children is directly determined by how well their mental, emotional and physical needs are met by those that take care of them. In more and more cases in America, by the one parent that takes care of them. A gay man will check homework, play catch, will drop them off at practice and will likely teach a kid to dress better. A gay mother will explain the importance of sharing, will be the shoulder in need, will read the bed time tale and help to choose the right college. Parenting...it doesn't take a straight person to do it right...it takes a loving, committed person(s) to do it well.   I have a great regard for marriage.  I'd like to be married one day...aspire to be a better person because my spouse inspires me.  If we truly want to "protect marriage", perhaps it's the straight community that needs to respect it more.  Perhaps we need fewer drunken nuptials in Vegas, an end to physically dominating your spouse, less nagging, less drinking, more family fun, more help with homework, less TV, more eating together, more bedtime tales, more of God, less of religion, no tolerance for sexual abuse, discipline without physicality...more laughing.  All of the above will strengthen families big or small, poor and rich.  More importantly, we can accomplish all of it without infringement on the priviledges of others to attain the same happiness.   Saturday afternoon  I built a fence with my parents and brother...the dog watched.  Over the years, my dad has been quite handy.  Attempting often succcessfuly to put up walls, tear them down, build bathrooms, sheds, paint, carpet, assemble..."home deposition".  This project, however, was most satisfying for him because we all did it together from noon til 6...measuring, digging, placing, solidifying...erecting a 20 foot long, 8 feet high fence to replace the withering chain-linker.    There are so many ideological fences up in America right now...regardless of where you think you stand on each issue, it's important to be able to see the other side...atleast then, you're sure doing the right thing.

      The Statue of Liberty was reopened yesterday...nearly 3 years after the fears of 9/11 closed it completely. Still, the occasion feels hollow as ascension is forbidden at this point. The officials have the nerve to dismiss the grandeur of the steps all the way up to the crown...have the gaul to say"most of you may think you have gone all the way up but you really haven't." I remember it just well buddy...it was a slow climb, hot and vast amongst rippled bronze. I wish I had been taller to really appreciate the view longer than my mom provided while hoisting me inside the crown. My parents arrived in 1978...by air. They did not have tears well up as a boat entered New York harbor unveiling that monumental woman. They did retain the same respect for what the statue stood for. A welcome, a beacon for tired, hungry masses willing to work hard and honestly so that their children may do the same and prosper. Proper screening (lists provided by the FAA), metal detectors at various entry points, and baggage restriction is a far more reasonable solution than sealing it off with a glass cieling. I'm just so sick of the cowardice and fear propogated by this administration, by this media, by our own citizens. We cannot prevent every possible terrorist attack...that is the genius of such tactics. They want fear. They want us to change our lives...to not fly anywhere, to walk among strapped, menacing police patting down old ladies, to not sleep at night because we're worried about our kids living in NYC. Fortunately we have not yet experienced the wrath of a walking suicide bomber in our urban streets. I must grimly predict that we cannot remain immune to this method of attack. How will we respond? Are we too cowardly to even wonder? Will we all stay home the next day? Steer clear of anyone in a coat? Attack a few Sikhs as retribution? Tangentially, I would surmise to say 90% of turban wearers in this country are Sikh. The Sikh faith forbids the cutting of hair...hence the long hair on Sikh women and the beards and such on men. The turbans are usually white and wrapped angled like an inverted V with the apex above the forehead. It's worn differently, more formally than the ones in the mideast and Afghanistan. But the difference here isn't turbanite fashion...it's the nature of the Sikh. India like the US is a secular democracy...atleast both aspire to be so. It is divided similarly into states with their own identities, dialects and cultures. Punjab is the state my family is from...the one where on late Christmas Eve 1976, I was born. We are not of the Sikh faith but the vast majority of Sikhs are in Punjab. Amongst Indians, Punjabis are known to be gregarious, informal, indulgent, creative, passionate. Most any Sikh I've known can Bhangra (an infectious, tabla drum based beat) hard, drink harder, and laugh heartily. I'm proud of my own boisterous, piercing but endearing laugh. Sikhs are also warriors, diligent at work, intelligent within. I'm not biased, just informed when I say that the best overall cuisine and cooks are often Punjabi. No one can touch my Mother's food and an invite can probably be arranged. Sikhs have been ignorantly targeted and misunderstood. I'm sure a significant portion of Americans think there is some connection between them and the Taliban. If I'm wrong, then they are atleast unaware of their identities as Sikhs. I seek not to blame but to enlighten the ignorant and unite. So let's let these law abiding Americans continue to drive their cabs, run their shops, treat their patients and tend their lives not just without the threat of violence but with the arms of brotherhood. I had my first date with Sherri yesterday and she has left me slightly confused and completely enamored. It's as if she's using  The Rules  on me. We drove together after work to a Blues bar about a mile away. It was empty which I found embarrassing but it was also early...a bit after 5. She was wearing fitting, subtle pin-stripe, beige pants with a sleeveless white top hugging her gently. Her hair was flaxen and she had on small, open-toed, brown, riveted shoes. I had a variety of domestic and imported beers eventually ending with a Duvel but sharing her 3rd and 4th Stoli and Tonic. The folks trickled in and friendly Karen behind the bar talked of her extensive toy pig collection while the cash I threw into the Juke played Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Stevie Ray Vaughn, BB King, Ray Charles...great music. We talked about her family...her father an enterprising plumber with a passion for classic cars (has a Camaro SS that I'd love to get behind) is someone I could dig. Her mom, the short, lovable paralegal whom she's relieved to look like (Sherri is much taller at 5'7"). Her brother was described as an angst filled, flippant teen more into bad tv and PS2 than grades and sports. Apparently the result of a mostly absent dad and the influence of younger, dumber kids. An intriguing chance to be a mentor occurred more than once to me. We talked about how she could not give up on her dreams of a PHD despite the obstacles. How I could have decided not to go to med school when I was rejected...but I found a way to do what I wanted. Her penchant for the NY Times...the upper Echelon of American Journalism.  She mentioned her singular, persistent, dry, hacking cough which in young people could be a Mycoplasma Pneumonia.  I went through other differentials and told her I'd give her a script for antibiotics since it hadn't resolved for nearly 2 weeks.     We talked about religion and spirituality, tolerance and the difference between Sashimi and Sushi. Our conversation was exciting and everywhere...her eyes were impressed with my attention and my heart rate did not slow to baseline. After 2 hrs at the bar, I thought I could cajole her into some food in downtown Port Jefferson but she said she wasn't hungry. Actually nor was I but I wanted to sit down and prolong her presence. She was surprised that I would pay for drinks, open my car door for her, go out of my way because she had a craving for a cigarette (which turned into 2 for each of us). I don't smoke regularly but I'm prone to with alcohol and the right company.  She commented on my chivalry, was pleased with it.  I dropped her back at her car at a little before 8...she claimed she had a great time but had so much to do...she asked me to call her at work tomorrow and as I was hoping but not anticipating a kiss, she went in for the cheek.  Uggh.  I must say I wasn't used to that.  I've become accustomed to charming my way to a woman's lips without much delay or resistance.  While her reluctance could be a sign that she isn't interested, the rest of the date was converse to that.  This weekend, I'm on call and she's upstate for a wedding or something.  Unlike most girls I've come across since breaking up with Susanna, Sherri is one I want to build something with... sweet and gorgeous...she lightens me.  So against all primal urges and premature conclusions, I will be patient.  My intentions are not hidden behind my courtesy.  Upon her exit, I realized I forgot to give her the script...shit.  I drove over to the nearest Duane Reade and wrote it out there.  I just called her at work to tell her the meds are ready for her, that I didn't forget...she was ofcourse grateful...I was naturally dismissive...not good with accepting praise.  We made plans to have dinner next week...it's hard to wait to see her.

      I marched into Sherri's office aware of the gossipy staff...trying to be sure of myself. She looked great...her eyes even bigger than I recalled..her hair, yellow gold. After lamenting on her computer access problems I was upfront about the softball game. She was great about it.."what am I going to do?...get mad?", she said with a grin. She told me she thought it was cute that my bro and I had such a ritual. I knew I had to sure up another day, so I asked about the next day...affirmative...sweet. We decided to meet in the cafeteria for lunch later and I lent her one of my favorite Jazz albums...considering her mention. "Kind Of Blue" by Miles Davis...a perfect relaxing sound...improvised, melodic, cool. Lunch with her was something I could get used to...she told about her affinity for Chocolate...that her 22nd birthday was in 2 weeks...22! At one point I caught a glimpse of her navel...lost most higher cerebral functioning for a brief moment. We spoke about the need for contribution, for leisure. I lofted off into a sun filled, affection fueled romp on a Caribbean island. Interestingly, she had just joined the Bally's I go to after getting sick of the "meat market" her gym had turned into. I told her I'd join her for a workout around 6 leaving me enough time to get to the game tonight. After 2 hours of text reading, I walked into the gym looking forward to seeing/checking her in her chosen attire. There by the tricep pushdown icarian machine...small, navy, silken shorts with a white, fitted v-neck. I was sweating just holding my cd player while talking with her. I started my usual 30 min run on an inclined treadmill getting faster at each 5 min interval. Playing BBall the day before left me with some "dead legs" but the site of her revved my heart rate up beyond normal. I finished the run panting, drenched...we exchanged glances here and there...I'm sure at one point she caught me checking out her ass...I couldn't look away. I was unusually spent by the end of my abridged workout and as I peeled out of the lot to meet my bro, I turned up the song...didn't even matter what it was. I was feeling swift at the game...hitting the ball well...hard...in BP, from both sides of the plate. Was looking forward to getting into some later. I did however get clocked in the side of the head by an errant throw from the outfield as I was pitching BP. Surely looked worse than it felt...a little sore this AM. Getting hit in the temple can be dangerous...an Artery called the Middle Meningeal courses rather superficially along the temporal portion of the skull. Rupturing that can lead to an undiagnosed epidural hematoma which is fatal unless evacuated. Meanwhile, in high arc softball, there are balls and strikes...players begin with a 1-1 count. In sum, it's not hard to hit a softball, even if it isn't a strike...a swinger will swing unless the ball can't be hit well...then there are guys who won't mind standing and taking pitches until they are walked. These guys are pussies and they are bad for the game. I didn't pay 150$ to go up and avoid taking cuts at the ball. Naturally, walking pads the bases and leads to unnecessary runs. In the Majors, a lead-off walk has a 79% chance of scoring. As catcher I expressed my opinion in general to the players acting so passive...particularly one guy who looked over his shoulder while walking to first. Later in the game, the jerk would walk AGAIN on 3 pitches that just missed. I let him hear it as he walked down again. We were down 2 runs...as most of theirs were the result of strategic walks...many. Another batter walked and following a base hit, the jerk bumped me at home plate. Well, that was about all it took...once he began calling me out, I charged into him throwing punches furiously connecting against the side of his head, keeping him in a headlock and putting his face in the dirt while his teammates rushed in from a few feet away to break things up. They pulled me out prematurely...I was really beginning to enjoy myself. Too bad the guys on my team were too stoned to get in quicker...eventually heard my brother trying to cool things off only getting more animated after the word "Osama" was yelled...this sent me fuming, aching to crack him. The both of us were ejected...naturally. We battled hard and despite 2 extra innings, we lost by 2. I felt responsible...we were short handed in the field with me out and my bat is a consistent one. The next game we crushed 17 runs in the first....17! The game was mercied. This is not the first time my intensity has taken control. Happens quite often though actual fights have been rare. I play hard...I ask others to do the same...not in every situation but the ones were honor is on the line. If 3 kids step onto a court talking trash...I want to beat them. The ferocity and having enough skills to compete allows me to rest. Ha...sure glad I cancelled with Sherri. Our post game included "chilling" with some teammates in the lot afterwards and a "sack" of White Castles for dinner. Perhaps the most underrated fast food. I suppose I will continue a diatribe on the culture, health and taste of FF joints but for now, let it be understood that the genius of White Castle is not unnoticed by my family. I remember many immigrant laden Queens afternoons testing my capacity for the deliciously manageable sliders. The price was always right...in the 80s these burgers were about a dime each. Healthy? According to a strict WC diet imposed on a willing teen, Edgar Ingram, one of the founders, stated "The student maintained good health throughout the three-month period and was eating 20 to 24 hamburgers a day during the last few weeks." Well...I would doubt that...highly...but it can't be worse than McDonalds.

        My weekend was predictable...guilty about not partying on Fri night...guilty about partying too hard the following night.  The feeling has subsided...throughout I was torn up thinking about Sherri...ridiculous I know...barely know the girl...just that I can't get over that sensation I had when seeing her.  As a bonifide adrenaline addict, I crave it...her.  I just got off the phone with her...I kept things moving smoothly until asking her if she wanted to get some "coffee" after work to which she replied "sure"...perhaps I can morph that into drinks.  I tried calling Sach from my office phone...wouldn't connect...needed to know if we have a softball game tomorrow.  Hope not.   (4 hrs later)...Shit...we have a game...now I have to walk into her office and tell her Tues is no good...is missing the game an option?...yes, but not one I want to take.  I bet there are many who would...who might subvert their own interests but I'd hate to be such a bitch and let my boys down.  I have a feeling she's easy going...won't be a problem.  Besides, I'm itching to play...last week we were rained out...the week before we dropped both games...while a grand slam felt nice, winning is always better.  Physical competition is inherent in men...no offense to female atheletes but the drive is not as biological.   Growing up as a first generation American, I learned most skills and sports on my own or through playing with friends.  Dave Hatasingh...a lithe, athletic, dark-skinned Trinidadian, older than me...had a connecting backyard with us.  I remember pitching to each other with a tennis ball and wiffle bat...whipping the balls hoping to stick them into the wire fence.  Breaking windows, hopping into other yards, learning how to switch-hit...doing it until our moms called us for dinner.  When Dave wasn't around, I'd toss a ball against the vinyl siding of my house...chasing short flies.  My brother Sachin was a bit too young to compete with us but we didn't exclude.  Atleast not intentionally.  I recall one afternoon of wiffle-self-hitting lead to me striking his orbit on the backswing.  It happened the next day again.  Kid didn't come near a bat for a month.  We would all eventually graduate from backyard antics to the big time...little league.   I remember how great I thought myself to look in that uniform.  Had my baseball socks on the wrong way.  My hat was unbent...right across.  Huge glasses.  I did like my cleats though...Mizuno...made sliding fun when I actually hit the ball.  Had to have a cup...you must protect the goods.  My dad though bought me a mens size...a black man's size...the cup was so huge, my knees couldn't touch.  I was armored.  I didn't have a bad yr...being picked near the bottom was standard in grade school but I did my part on this team...apparantly the practice helped.  Still, all I remember was the snacks after games...I mean, is there a better reason to play organized sports?  Nothing beats a dusty chocolate cupcake and some milk.
