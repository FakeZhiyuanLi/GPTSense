       Saturday 22 May 2004(Arizona’s Time)    Arrived at 1:30pm at Tucson International Airport, an hour’s drive away from Sierra Vista. The moment I saw Dar, the emotional build up over the past 24 hours suddenly overpowered me and I cried. Thankfully, we were in public, so conscious me controlled myself.  Luggage was delayed, so we arranged for it to be sent to our place in 4 hours’ time. We drove through Tucson City, and though it was bigger and more modern than I thought it’d be, I was still a little disappointed. Where were the people on a Saturday afternoon???? Definitely not Orchard Road!!!  We reached “home” – place we will be for the next 4 months – at about 3 plus. 1555 E. Busby Dr Apartment C319 Vista De La Sierra Apartments, Sierra Vista, AZ 85635. A simple set up of 2 brm, 1 bath, 1 small kitchen and a small living room. My first thought? Nice…..  We drove to the nearby shopping malls to take a look, and also to get some daily necessities. Kept reminding myself that it’s US$ we’re talking here, so cannot “shop till I drop”. At Wal-Mart, we bought sundries, pillows, etc……then proceeded to Target (miss Australia already) and walked slowly down every aisle. Then went to Fry’s to get groceries…..everything was in Singapore pricing but in US$. Definitely going to eat in everyday and try to save money here.  The tax here is unbelievable! 9%! Immediately signed up for  Fry’s membership card that will get me about 25% discount!!! Oh dear, I hope I don’t’ end up developing a “housewife” mentality when we get back to Singapore – discount…must get!!!! Argh!!!  The luggage arrives at 9 plus and I start unpacking. Seeing all those stuff that my parents bought for us makes me miss them so much. I sms them and wait for their reply.  Night’s falling. The sun doesn’t set till about 8pm. Mel’s accustomed to the time here already, except Gerald and me. I suddenly get depressed. What are my parents doing now? We're 15 hours behind, so that means, everybody's awake in S'pore now. Church service is starting now, teens service soon…….my heart is so heavy now…….  Gerald gets cranky and I’m surprised. He was an angel on the plane and didn’t cry much. So we feed him the cough/cold medicine and he falls asleep. I struggle to shut my eyes ‘cos everytime I do so, I seem to get transported back to Singapore. I take the medicine for cold and start drifting to sleep.    Sunday 23 May   I don’t’ wake up till 1pm!!!!! That’s almost 12 hours worth of sleep!!!! Dar says GG slept at 1am and only woke at 9am this morning!!!!  It feels weird not waking up early and rushing to get to church on time. Going to miss that kind of routine very badly.   We decide to visit the Flea Market, but by the time I get up from bed, wash up and pack GG’s bag, the people have gathered their wares and gone home. So we head for another Mall, this time, more resembling Perth’s Booragoon Garden City (before renovation). Bought 2 storybooks for GG (I make up my mind to develop good reading habits for GG when we r here in AZ) and visited the Commissionary, the place at Fort Huachuca where stuff are tax free!!!!  Bumped into 3 of Dar’s training mates at the supermarket. Seeing them makes me feel very thankful that I’m here with Dar. Their wives and children are at home and how much they must missed them!!!!  I cooked Bak Kut The and Dar keeps telling me how yummy it is. Don’t think it’s because of my cooking, but of how he misses the smell and taste of Chinese food   Fed GG some Veg/Chicken Baby food and he finished half the bottle. He likes them!   I try not to think of Singapore again and I almost succeed, till I start writing my diary. The internet is not going to be up till Wed/Thurs, so till then, I’m going to read and watch TV. Yuck! Can’t believe that I’m actually doing such stuff. Where’s the workaholic Wen????  Dar’s going back to training tomorrow and I’m a little dreading it. That means that I’ll be home alone with GG the whole day…..feeding, washing, cooking, cleaning…..Sigh…….4 months of doing this! Must force myself to look on the bright side. It’s going to be quality time with my hubby and son. I’m a source of envy   Going to start reading the book “Cover to Cover” Bible companion. It’s time to get back to basics once again.  Monday 24 May  Dar’s gone back to work. He went PT early in the morning and came back again for breakfast. Dar’s a very sweet hubby who loves us very much. Last night, GG was kinda cranky again and Dar carried him to bed with us to sleep. It was nice having our son with us. Sweet smelling   I read the pop-up book, Counting the Numbers from 1 to 10 about ten times to GG today! He loves the pictures but I think I’m going to get bored if I keep reading it. Don’t know if it was because he was still suffering from Jet Lag, but he slept intermittently. But he kept having nightmares and woke up abruptly. Hope his consistent crying don’t disturb the neighbours.  Dar took the car today. He had wanted me to send him to work so that I could have transport to get around. But Harlow!!! Left hand drive!!! Definitely not confident enough!  He came back at 5:15pm today and it was a nice feeling knowing that his son and wife were at home waiting for him. It was also a nice change to have him come back so early.   I took over the wheel and did a demo drive to the Fort in the evening, with Dar giving me directions. Not took bad, but my palms were sweating!!! We drove to the Oriental store, but keeping in mind that we CANNOT overspend, I bought only cooking necessities.   I cook omelette with corned beef, chilli spinach and drink last night’s soup. Simple home-cooked meal. Tomorrow, maybe I’ll cook Green Curry. Just one dish, but with chicken and lots of veg in it.  It’s night fall again. I’m forcing myself not to think of S’pore. Asked Dar what time it was now in S’pore, and he replied “noon”. What’s everybody else doing?   GG’s gone to sleep already. I hope he sleeps thru the night.  Tomorrow, I’m going to take the car. Need to do id for myself so that I can use the Fort’s facilities. Will also bring the car in for servicing. Hope that all these errands will keep my mind occupied. Pray that GG will also be good. He doesn’t seem to like the car seat a lot. Squirms and cries whenever he’s put into it. But what to do? In the US, it’s compulsory. Not to say that in S’pore, we don’t do it. But here, the military police very hardworking.  Read thru Dar’s assignment on the battle that took place in Vietnam. He had to do a battalion analysis. Wha….i was VERY impressed. When he retires next time, I hope he gets to lecture to soldiers!!!  Going to read my book now. Read a parenting magazine this afternoon. Quite informative, but not as easy to read like those found in S’pore. May try doing my cross word puzzle tomorrow.   Dar’s training is going to finish on 1 Sept. That means, we get to come home earlier!!! Yipee!!!!  Wednesday 26 May 2004  Didn’t have the chance to write in the diary last night. GG was super cranky. Don’t understand why he’s like that ONLY at night!!!! So I rocked him to sleep, and we ended up sleeping next to each other. I think my right leg was over his tummy. Oops!!!  Oh, dad arrived in LA yesterday evening and sms me. The moment I read his sms, I cried like a baby. I missed home so badly!!!!! I smsed him that maybe I had made the wrong decision to come here. It’s so boring and I don’t have anything to amuse myself. Miss the adrenalin pumping thinking I normally do at work.  Cried till my eyes were swollen. Dad told me to make the best of my decision and to think on the bright side. At least the family was together. Sigh……I don’t’ know. Dar said Auntie Tiak told him that if I were to stay for the whole 4 months, I would come back to S’pore a stronger person. Double sigh…….no one gets such a golden opportunity to go overseas. I have twice the experience!!!! But I’m greedy. I wish all my loved ones were with me.  Smsed Bea too. Don’t know why….but I miss having her around.   Hmmmm…..what did I do yesterday? Ooh….i had to do my ID. Went to the Military Office and had to wait for Dar to come in person before I could do the card. This ID card is going to be super useful. I can use ALL the facilities on Fort Huachuca for FREE as long as I show my card. Even can get military discount at the commissiorry.   Went to the ACS (Army Community Service) – Ha! Ernie would be pleased that ACS is also famous in the States  The place allows military personnel to borrow things for free, as long as we register. Dar got majority of our household stuff from ACS; I got a high chair and a jumper for GG. Can feed him easier and he can also amuse himself on the latter.  Came back in the morning around 10 plus and slept with GG for 2 hours. Boy, can he sleep! Read in the book that the next growth spurt would be at 6 months. Also started feeding him Nestum. He loves it!!!  We went to the library yesterday and I borrowed some magazines – Good Housekeeping and Parenting. Gosh…….sounds auntie!!! Don’t know if I’ll get the chance to read them. They’re due next week. The children books are also quite interesting. But I think they’re written with the Mexican/Spanish people in mind.    I can sense that the place here is very spiritual. Don’t know if it’s the Red Indian origin or something……but there’s this sense of dread and deadness! People still say “Hi”, but you can see that they’re missing something, thru their eyes.   Last night, Dar woke me up and told me that if I still feel miserable at the end of Jun, maybe I should consider going home. I don’t know why, but I felt much much better after hearing that. But it’s not me to just chicken out like that. Wendy NEVER says “Quit”!  I cooked Thai Green Curry today. Just one dish but I threw in some vegetables too. Quite yummy actually. Some leftover for tomorrow too. Cool! GG’s acting up again and we had a hard time calming him down.   I’m looking forward to the coming Memorial Day long weekend. Dar’s going to be off on Fri thru to Mon (inclusive) and we’re thinking of driving to Phoenix. It sounds exciting.   I called homed today and spoke to mum (9am S’pore time) and told her that I missed home. Ohhh……and also asked her to cut my newspaper subscription. Jia lat……wonder how many copies I have outside my door now   Friday, 28 May 2004  Thursday was boring, as usual, so I guess that’s why I didn’t bother to update my diary. Let me see what I can recall doing.  Sent Dar to work, then drove straight to Wal-Mart to buy my hph charger. Forgetful me forgot to bring it to States, so have to pay another US$26.91 for another one. Ohhh….remembered driving to Gas City to pump petrol. The system here is slightly different. You either pay for it first, pump then go back into the station to collect your change. Or just pump first then pay. Think their “pay first” policy only applies before 10pm or something.   Supposed to go to the thrift shop at the Fort to hunt for some stuff, but I was too bored (I think lazy) to go. Son was cranky again…..i’m starting to think that maybe it’s the house.  We tried sending the car in for servicing this evening (free ‘cos it’s rental), but we were too late. Dar was supposed to finish school at 3pm, but ended up being dismissed at 4 plus. Turned out that they could have left at 10am, but the school made all of them stay back to witness a ceremony. Poor hubby had to stand in the hot sun for about 1 hour!!!!  Received Pearlyn’s sms in the evening and it really made my day  Dar was actually asking me to call someone in Singapore. But the only people I wanted to speak with was either Bets in Melbourne or Inez in Perth. But didn’t want to ‘cos costs will be high. Pearlyn says she missed us (she fondly calls GG zai zai), and I wished I had a teleporter to transport me thru and fro States and Singapore as and when I wanted. Crazy!!!!   I’m excited this morning (though I had to drag myself out of bed ‘cos it’s so nice to stay in bed because of the coolness in the air – u don’t get that in Singapore!!!!) because we’re going to drive to Phoenix!!!!! It’s about 4 hours drive away and it’s the capital of Arizona. Also the place where RSAF sends their pilots/technicians for training. I’m just dying to hear/smell/see some Singaporeans.  We left at 10 plus in the morning, and arrived at Tucson first. The city is big and it looks exciting. GG was very good throughout the journey. Think he was also excited.   We went to this place called Foothills Mall in Tucson. I nearly fainted from excitement seeing all the huge shops! There was Nike factory outlet, Levi’s factory outlet, shoe shops………I bought something from each shop!!!!! This IS civilization!!!!! Where on earth is Sierra Vista located? On another planet???!!!!! Think we should make a trip down here every week, before I die from boredom!!!!  We got lost trying to find downtown Phoenix. When we reached it, I was in awe!!!!! The buildings were grand yet very cosmopolitan! This is what I call a modern town!!!!! We drove around the place and saw many nice apartments. Wish Sierra Vista had places like that. Then at least I won’t feel so depressed staying at home.  Finally arrived at Arizona Mills Mall. Man…..if u think Takashimaya is big, wait till u see this place! It’s gigantic!!!!! Bought myself a pair of Nine West Shoes at 50% off!!!!! Red and sporty, just the kind of shoes I’ve been hunting around for. There was Gap, Guess, Polo Ralph Lauren etc……wanted to get some things for Dar, but he didn’t’ want. He reckoned that he had spent enough on a new pair of golf clubs  Silly man!!! Oh, at Guess, I heard some ladies speaking in Chinese and I just lit up. Sounded so sweet!!!!! Bought for GG some clothes, a toy and a pram. Can’t wait to see him in it   Dar tells me that his IMSO at the Fort told him that there are 2 Singaporean couples who settled in Sierra Vista. I can’t wait to visit them!!!!!   We settled into SpringHill Suites, a subsidiary of Marriott. It’s very modern and I was super excited at knowing that there was broadband!!!! But my excitement turned to sadness when we realised that our room didn’t have to connection. Plus the USB plug didn’t fit into our laptop. Sigh…..  When I think of us going back to Sierra Vista tomorrow, I’m filled with dread. Frankly speaking, if my family and friends were to see where we were located, and compare it with Phoenix, they would also feel the same.   Dar says that we can always stay another extra night, but I know it’s just us bluffing ourselves. Another night away from Sierra Vista would still mean that we have to go back. The only thing that I can console myself is to remember that we can always come to Phoenix once a month. The thought of that brings smiles to my face already.  I put GG to bed and say a prayer for him. He looks so sweet in his PJ under the covers. I pray that he will have a heart for God, grow up in righteousness and be a man of integrity. Plus, I asked God to show us, as parents, the right way to bring son son up.  Saturday, 29 May 2004  Exactly one week from day I left. So sad…..only one week. Another 3 months 3 days left…….very looooonnnnngggg…….We’re back in Sierra Vista – no men’s land   We went back to the Mills Mall one last time before going home and I bought some more clothes from Old Navy. It’s good to know that I dropped another clothes size   I’m filled with dread at the thought of going back. Imagine being cooped up in an old dingy apartment, cleaning up diapers, feeding and bathing baby……..i quickly snapped out of my negative mode. Instead, I think on the positive side – I get to spend every waking moment with my son!!!!  ON the last lap home, I forgot GG’s feeding time. Couldn’t figure out why he was screaming and yelling at 4 plus. Then, suddenly, “Alamak! It’s his feeding time lar!” Immediately, he stops crying once the bottle gets into his mouth. Sigh……what kind of mother forgets such stuff??  Before going home, we go for a drive, looking at nicer apartments. We go to Oasis and Mountain View. They ARE beautiful. We wonder if we can get out of our present contract and move to one of these. Can’t explain how they look like, but let’s just say, if I were to stay at either of them, I would gladly stay at home 24 hrs. Yap, it’s cosy and homey looking. We’ll see….better read our present contract properly first before doing anything. Don’t want to do anything that will breach it.  We drive past 2 churches and make up our mind to visit them tomorrow morning. One is Mountain View Assembly of God, the second……First Christian Church. Don’t know why….but I feel more comfy with the former. Service starts at 8:45am and they also have family meetings on Wed nights!!!! Tonight I’m going to pray and ask God to lead us to the right church. Super important!!!!  We do laundry at home. Oh….there’s no washing machine in the house (it’s a norm in the States and in Oz), so we have to walk a few steps to the Laundromat. Here, we use the dryer too. It’s US$1.25 for a full load of wash and US$0.75 for drying clothes. Quite good, but ex lar.  I’m reading the magazines that I borrow from the Fort’s library. Made up my mind to go the Fort’s gym next week. I better lose my remaining 4kg by the time we return to Singapore!  I made a call home but as usual, connection was bad. Sigh…….guess because we’re so away from “civilization”?? Miss dad and mum like crazy! Wish they were here with me……   Oh…..forget to mention that Bea and Delia sms me!!!! It definitely made my day!!!! I miss them so much…keep thinking of what they’re doing in S’pore now.   It’s Quek’s 21st birthday celebration tomorrow morning (S’pore time at 5:30pm). Will try to wake up at 4am (our time) to send birthday wishes. He’s a great guy…we consider him a buddy and brother…..Wish we were there in S’pore.    Sunday, 30 May 2004  This morning, we TRIED to wake up for 8:45am service, but failed. So kicked ourselves out of bed and attended the 11:15am service at Mountain View AOG. As usual, when I’m faced with something new, I get abit apprehensive at first. Even hubby remarked. But the moment I stepped into their chapel, my wall crumbled slightly. However, in order not to be over disappointed, I did not say anything. Must wait till their worship start first.  Their first song “I walk by faith”!!! Had to steal a laughter by myself ‘cos they were singing it too slowly. But hey, at least it’s a familiar song! Soon, songs that we had sung back home surfaced. Not bad……  Their senior pastor was away, so their associate pastor cum youth pastor Dean welcomed us. It was a nice feeling. People also started walking towards us at the end of service to speak with us. Think GG was the magnet  They always comment on how cute he is, before talking with us.  I innocently asked if they have cell groups (I was pacticaly dying to have some fellowship and do some bible study!!!) but Dean said they were still working on it. Instead, they have what they call fellowship groups – Men’s Discipleship, Women’s Ministry etc…even Student Ministry. All of their other ministries meet on Wed at 7pm. I’m definitely coming for their Women’s Ministry!!!!  Found out something interesting too! In S’pore, when we say Sunday School, we all assume that it’s meant for children only ala. Young Arrows. But here, Sunday School represents meetings for various age groups. Wow! And the most amazing thing?  Their nursery classes are for children from birth to 3 years old!!!!! U know what I’m going to do? I’m going to visit their students’ ministry, nursery church etc……that way, I’m going to load myself up with experience!!!!  We finish church at about 1 plus and head for Wendy’s for lunch. Feels kind weird not having lunch with LSBC ppl. After that, we head to the commissary to do the week’s groceries. We’ve given ourselves a budget - $100 a week. Dar says that if I can keep to that or even spend lesser, I can keep the rest and use it for my shopping expenditure!!!! Cool! I tell him w’re going to eat rice with jalapenos (Mexican chilli) everyday!!!!  Dar feels like playing golf so we head to a super small golf course. I try my hand at putting. Can’t say I enjoyed myself, but I’m glad I’m doing something that Dar likes.  Tomorrow, it’s Memorial Day, so Dar gets to stay at home!!! Yipee! Think we’re going for a picnic   Monday, 31 May 2004  Alamak! I didn’t know May had 31 days!!!! Another 3 months and 1 day remaining??  We slept till 10am. GG was very sweet. He work up early and cried alittle. I carried him to our bed and fed him at about 8am, then he went back to sleep. We notice that he actually wakes up earlier than us, but remains quietly by himself in his playpen. Considerate baby   Dar completes the remaining quizzes that he has to do. I took a look and he remarked that the quiz contained some dumb questions. For e.g. what is active and passive voice??? Huh???? Silly question. I’m not the kind to like such stuff.  We didn’t go for the picnic as planned. After lunch, Dar falls asleep on the couch for about an hour. Since son was also sleeping, I read my Parenting and Women’s Day magazine for recipes and for bringing up babies. There was an interesting article on How Motherhood has changed You. As I reflect back, I think it has revealed certain character traits that I never knew existed. Deep down, I’m still a dependent girl who needs her parents to be around. Then there’s also the “must make sure GG is all right before I can relax” kind of feeling. Mum and Dad always says that I have to look after myself first before GG. But I always place him before myself. Hmmmm……mother’s love. That’s why I appreciate my mother even more now.   I feed GG some ice cream today. If mum were to find out, I’m dead  We bought a tub of orange/vanilla sherbet/ice cream yesterday. GG loved it!!!! We took some pictures and will definitely send it to the cell group.   Oh! Dar suggests going for a movie. It’s going to be a challenge with GG around, but nevertheless, we try. NO pain, no gain! We buy tickets for Raising Helen, a Kate Hudson movie. The first half of the movie was good. GG drank his milk and slept. Then, a wift of aroma started drifting around us. In the dark, it was difficult to check GG’s diapers. So we shrugged and told ourselves that it must have been GG”s powerful gas outbreak again. Ten minutes later, the smell gets unbearable. I checked again and put my nose near his diapers. WOAH!!!! Talk about a stink bomb!!! We left about 30 minutes before the movie ended as GG was getting abit squirmish.  By the time we reached home, we were holding our breaths! Thank goodness the pooh didn’t harden. I didn’t have a hard time cleaning son up. Come to think about it, it was the second time he had poohed! Think it was the ice cream   Dar gets a call from Peter Lim, a staff officer at the G2 army. Dar has got his crab!!!! The official letters are being prepared now, and Dar would be officially Major Melvin Gan on 1 Jul. Ha! Since he always jokes that the wife wears the husband’s rank, I’m going to be known as Major Wendy!!! Cool!!!! He gets the crab and I’m full of crap!!!!  I cook sweet potato soup for Dar – one of his favourite dessert. Son sleeps at 8pm. I’m going to go back to my magazines soon. Need to return all of them to the library by Wed.   Stacia calls me. It’s a very nice surprise. She asked which part of Arizona I’m in and I joke that Sierra Vista is such a small town that I don’t think it’s even in the map of America!! She’s going to Japan/Thailand next Sun. Sounds exciting! Miss her and the rest again. Ok, I’m not going to dwell on it. Time will pass quickly.  Can’t wait for the phone line to be up tomorrow. I hope they don’t screw up our orders again  Then once we have our IDD line, it’s internet 24 hrs a day!!!!  Tuesday, 1 Jul  The phone's up and the Internet's all geared up to be used now!!!!  It's been a busy morning.l I send Dar to work, then head to the Thrift Shop to see if i can a DVD player and Vacuum cleaner. The latter costs US$20. atg the end of the course, we can sell it back to them again. the money goes to charity :)  send the car for servicing. everyone (mechanics and clerks) remarks at how handsome GG is. i pick him up from the pram and smell him. he always has this sweet baby aroma about him.  it's off to ACS to find out more info about courses for me. sigh....i can't bring GG to the classes, so that means it's out for me. Maybe i'll join a mother/tot playgroup on Wed mornings. must meet friends  we head home and i spend the rest of the afternoon surfing and replying emails. Plan to send one email to all TSLs soon. miss them so much!!!  it's true when once u get busy, time passes so quickly. Dar sms me to pick him up at 3pm and then we head to PX (a mini shopping place for military) to see if we can get a cheap DVD player. we opt for a portable one so that we can use it everywhere we go. not cheap - US$59!!!  Dar receives his second hadn golf clubs and heads for the driving range. i stay at home to look after GG> Boy! it's super hot today. it's almost 102 F today (not sure what it is in degree celcius, maybe 38??)  We feed GG nestum and mashed bananas. he looks so funny!!! i pretend that the spoon is an aeroplane and his mouth is the tarmac for landing. he immediately spits it out and the stuff drops onto Dar's hand!!! awesome view!!!  Dar remarks that i won't need to sleep once the Internet is up. HOw true!!!  Dad and mum calls from S'pore. It's Vesak Day and how i miss them!!! They miss GG so much. Even dad remarks that 2 weekends without seeing his grandson is wierd. Mum told him that i may go back in late Jun. hmmm....not sure though. i'm torn between going home and staying. i keep playing back a picture of Dar driving home alone from TUcson Int'l Airport to SIerra Vista. Would he cry? that thought of it breaks my heart and i'm more determined to stay.

      I've been really bad at updating thie blog. Now i'll have to try to recall what has happened the last 1 week!  Let's rewind to Fri, 4 Jun.   Hmmm.....the sky looked liked it was going ot rain. funny that....it's summer here.....then we found out that Arizona has a funny weather "habit", - it rains more during summer. i decide to surprise Dar by picking him up earlier , so son-son and i go to the library first then it's off to school to pick him up. i arrive at 5pm, then wait wait wait....till 6pm....sigh....i get upset. why doesn't he tell me how late he's going to be? i drive to the Commissiory to get some groceries. then i get his sms to pick him up.  We have a quarrel about him being late. SIgh....i know that i shouldn't have expected him to finish early. My fault....but when u're at home most of the time, that's the biggest thing u look forward the whole day - picking him up.   Dar go angry and called up United Airlines to check the next available flight. 27th Jun. Hmph! We ignore each other for about 15 minutes and start talking about it. Dark clouds disappear and the sun appears!!! We tell ourselves that we must NEVER expect things from each other.  GG has learnt to make funnt sounds whenever he's excited. it's funny when suddenly, he makes ooohhhhhh.....ahhh.......eh......we always scoop him up and rain kisses on him. he's also mastered the art of swallowing semi solid foods now. we no longer have to scramble for cloth to wipe up food that gets spit out from his mouth.  Sat, 5 Jun  Dar goes off for his golf game at 9am. Today, he's playing with some Americans - must try to build friendships. He's going to attempt the 18 hole. Looks like it's going to be just son and myself. I secretly wish that Dar doesn't go, but i know that it's his only break from studies. So i relent.  I get a surprise visit from Lisa, a hospitality team worker from Mountain View AOG. Over here, it's a culture to bake cookies/cake and visit a newcomer to church. I'M IMPRESSED. ah well.....Mel always says i'm a sucker when it comes to ppl being genuinely nice to me.   We decide to watch Harry Porter. This time, i'm bringing pampers with me!!! Son is VERY good throughout the first 1/2. that's when we start smelling something wierd again!!! true enough....GG has poohed!!!! I rushed off to the changing room with him and whew! just in time 'cos i think it was going to spill out of the pampers!!! We head back to the cinema. But he's getting a little cranky. However he soon calms down and enjoys watching the movie. When we get to the scene where SIrus Black suddenly emerges as the black dog, son son yelps in shock!!! Dar and i cannot help but laugh uncontrollably. We've got a funny son.   We buy back KFC for dinner - i'm on strike today :)   BUt went to the Oriental shop anyway. The old man at the cashier asks where i'm from. WHen i say Singapore, he says "Nice, so u must be Malaysian!" My eyes nearly popped out from their sockets!!! When will ppl (Americans especially) learn that we're a Nation by its own??? Brings me back to a few days ago when another AMerican asks where i'm from. This time, when i said Singapore, he says "Oooo....that's in CHina right?" Wah.....FAINTED!!!!  Dar explains to me that many Americans don't bother about geography. Or even if they do, they still think S''pore is a Third World country!!!! Sigh......  Sun, 6 Jun  It's church day!!!! i get excited!!!!  We sing very very familiar songs today - Amazing Grace, Celebrate Jesus, ....can't remember. bad memory.....today Youth Pst Drean preaches on stress. i listen very attentively. i marvel at how he can change a passage of "come to me all ye who are weary" into something so profound. for e.g. what does yoke mean? it's a partnership...so when God asks us to take his yoke, he's asking us to be in partnership with him. when serving in ministry, whenever we feel stressed, we need to think why we're stressed. when we say we want to go sabbathical, most of the times, we come back NOT feeling rejuvenated. why? 'cos our mind sets are NOT changed.  Ps Dean explains further by saying that when we are stressed, it's 'cos we are arrogant and aggressive. arrogant = we think we don't need God's help. aggressive = never slow down to listen to what God wants us to do  So, we must be submissive and humble. submissive = do ONLY what God tells u to do. Humble = never think that u're the ONLY best person to do the job.   wow!!!! i gain new insight to this passage!!!  we take GG to the pool to have his first swim. he loves it! we attempt to put him underwater for a few seconds. the moment he comes up gasping for breath, he looked like he was going to howl!!! but our brave son burst into his sunshine smile. i take pictures of him swimming. think pearlyn and bea going to faint from exhilaration!!  We decide to go play tennis at the Fort. But Dar falls asleep. Ha,......at least it's not me who's feeling sleepy. We head to the Fort at about 5 plus and visit hte gym. Since it's closing at 6pm, we don't get to play tennis. the pool here is quite disappointing. But hey, at least there's a pool!!!! I sign up for an Aerobics class for Mon, Wed and Thurs. Gotta get my fat butt up from all those couch potato habits i've acquired since coming here. I've gained a kilo!!!!!!

      Hi Blog  Got a scolding from Pea for not updating the blog. See lar....see what a lazy bum i've turned into!! Let's see, let's rewind the clock and try to remember any interesting things i've done in the past week.  Thursday, 11 Jun  I wake up excited, knowing that it's the last day of the working week for Mel. Tomorrow's a public holiday, well NOT a holiday, but more of a day to remember ex President Ronald Reagan. He passed away over the weekend, and on Fri, all military personnel get a day "off" as a mark of respect. ALl American flags are flown at half mast. I think it's good at how they remember past Heads of State. Did Ong Teng Cheong get such respect when he died? Don't remember our flag flown at half mast.   I didn't go to the gym. Too lazy, also because Dar finished at around 2pm and i wanted to be home together with hubby and son :) We go to Dunkin Donuts (yumnmy!!!!) and buy 1/2 dozen worth of sinful and fattening carbo-laden donuts! that's 3 for each of us!!! man....all the chocolate filled, glazed donuts.......bad for health.....  Fri, 12 Jun  We're going hiking today! We wake up slightly later today and i make French Toast for Dar. Not sweet enough though.....I eat two sunny side ups:)  We head for Reservoir Hill. Don't let the name fool you. There's NO water here. As we make our way slowly uphill, Dar gives me some geography and history lessons. In the past, when the Americans were in a battle with the Red Indians, they would camp at the food of the mountains to lie in wait for the latter. That's why the buildings near the hill are known as Apache Junction. Instead of climbing up the mountains and then descending down, the Red Indians would hike thru the valleys. That way, it would not be so tired.   Looking down, i can see that in the valleys, the grass is greener and more healthy looking. Mel explains that when rain comes, it normally flows down and stays longer in the valleys.   Boy! It's tough climbing up. I have with me a haversack filled with bottles of water and GG's milk. Mel is carrying son son. Abit dangerous, cos if he falls, GG would get injured. I get headaches while climbing 'cos the air is super dry. I chance upon a sturdy looking stick and take it along with me. We take about 45 min to get to the top. Next time, we're going to try going up even higher.  On the way down, Mel slides down. As GG was in the carrier and was also swaying, Mel tried to prevent GG from slipping off. He gets injured instead. He hurts his right palm, but thank goodness it's not a fracture. Looks like a muscle strain. Poor thing....  There's a white airship hovering above us. Mel explains that it serves as a security camera for neighbouring Mexico. It allows the army in the Fort to be prepared if anything happens in Mexico. Cool! And u know what? everyday, thousands of Mexicans try to enter America thru the mountains of Arizona!!   Sat 12 Jun  We accompany Dar to the golf course together with some of his American classmates. We follow in the buggy. Wow! The view is beautiful. The golf course is situated in a residential estate and the buggy is able to go past the huge holiday homes that people buy. In the 4 hours that we were there, GG and i enjoyed ourselves. We saw bunnies and butterflies....trees swaying in the wind. Don't know why my son has a fascination for trees. In the morning when he wakes up, he can lie quietly in his bed, just watching the trees outside the window.  At night, we go watch Garfield!!! GG cries for about 5 minutes and quickly settles down. We get to complete the movie!!! The story's quite light hearted and it really shows the crafty side of cats. Not because i don't like felines, but Garfield epitomises "Fat, Greedy, Crafty" cats!!!  Sun 13 Jun  Today, the church has organised a BBQ and we're joining them. MUST make effort to know more people mah!! I cook "Mapo Tofu" as a dish to ppl to share. Also bring some steak and sausages to BBQ. At the end of second service, we head back home to get the food.  We finally get to meet the SP and his wife. Very very nice ppl. In fact, i was commenting to Mel that the pastor's wife, Ruth, is the kind of grandmotherly figure that reminds me of my own deceased grandma. We talk and Ruth casually asks Mel if i worked in S'pore. My dear husband tells her that i'm involved in Youth Work in church and lets slip that he's the Youth Pastor. alamak!!!! She wants to introduce us to her son-in-law who's the youth pastor. sigh....i don't like ppl to know our "status" 'cos that would mean that ppl would keep an extra eye on us and may ask us to help out. I love to help out, but i would RATHER not be linked with youth pastor's wife = superwoman!!!  We send Veronica back to the Post as we were going to the Commissiory to get our weekly groceries. SHe's from New York and has been here for almost 8 months. Wonderful and bubbly lady. Only 19 years old. She asks if we've been to Nogales, Mexico and we said that we were planning a trip. SHe brightens up and asks if we were keen to go this weekend. I'm excited too!!!!  We go to Blockbuster to rent "The view up there" (Gyneth Paltrow - about stewardess) and "Dumb and Dumbererer" (no wrong spelling here). Both are silly movies which we just wanted to watch to end the day on a light note.   GG is very tired. He didn't get his usual afternoon nap 'cos of the BBQ, so he slept very early.   Monday, 15 Jun  It's Aerobics today!!! I look forward to it the moment i wake up. Mel has PT early in the morning. So he takes the car and then come home for a quick shower. We send him to school. GG and me then go to the car rental company to pay the car rent and then off we go for his immunisation jabs.  At the clinic, he's all smiles. The doc recommends that she gives GG 2 additiional jabs - one to prevent meningitis and influenza. Since i'm not sure if our travel insurance would cover these, she recommends that i go to the public health department instead. over here, because they stress alot on childrens' vaccine, GG's injection may be free after all. But i tell her that GG may not get to enjoy the "free" privilege 'cos we're not citizens here.   She checks and announces that we can still do the injections at her clinic after all, and we pay US$11 per jab. GG gets 3 shots - 2 on right thigh and 1 on left thigh - he only whimpers. But at the last one, he cries for 10 sec and stops. I scoop him up and hold him close to me. My poor son.....  He falls asleep the moment we get into the car. He has 3 handy plasts on this thigh. he looks VERY cute. we go to Food City to check out the supermarket. Nice place and i end up buying some stuff.  Gym today is fun. Only 3 of us and we do boxing. Wah....my inner thighs hurt during the exercise buy i psych myself "i will have leaner thighs in 2 months' time".  Tuesday 16 Jun

      Wed 17 Jun  Argh!!! Had a horrible headache last nightn so i took a new painkiller - Aleve. The TV commercial highly recommended it - even claimed that it was better than panadol. I read the instructions at the back of the pkt. don't see ibroprufen, so i take it. bad idea....woke up in the middle of the night and tried opening my eyes. Couldn't at all. Woke Dar up and when he saw me, he exclaimed "Wah liao! You look like a Korean!"  My eyes look as if i've been stung my the mother of all bees. The last time i looked like this was in Sec 3 when i took Codeine, a painkiller to soothe my badly injured knee when taking part in the Sprint Competition. At the start of the race at the 100m start, my eyes were beginning to itch. By the time i ran towards the finishing line, i could barely see where i was running!   I get to the pharmacy to buy an allergy reliever. Prayed first before eating. By about 6pm, the swell has gone down. Dar says i look like a Japanese now. He teases me by saying he wished he had taken a picture of me. Idiot!  I finally finish the book "Dogs of Babel" - a light mystery book where the guy tries to see if his dog knows what happened the few hours before his wife fell from an apple tree. Was it murder or did she commit suicide? Talks about the inner demons of his wife, how she would go into tantrums, depression at certain times. Also talks about him trying to teach the dog to talk. yap......crazy book. Bottomline of the story? Talk about love...and how sometimes, we take love for granted....daily life becomes a mundane affair. and we should never attempt to change love.

      Saturday 19 Jun  Dar organised a BBQ for the international students this evening. He goes off for his Sat morning golf session and returns only at about 1pm. GG is slightly cranky. Fed him his cereal for breakfast and he spit it out at me. Definitely not on purpose, but 'cos i'm upset that Dar has left me alone, i get irritated at the poor kid.   I go to the kitchen and force myself to start praying. It works! Few things came to mind: 1) Why should i get upset that Dar has gone to play golf? 2) He goes for classes daily and Sat is his only free time 3) I get to spend extra time with my son 4) Getting upset over trivial matters would only make me feel irritated the whole day  Once he gets home, we start preparing the BBQ stuff. I'm very happy doing all these marinating and cutting. Hmmm....have i gone all domesticated??  We have a very happy BBQ session up at Reservoir Hill. As usual, the Saudis flew aeroplane again. What is wrong with these guys? They don't go for classes, PT, and when they say they're coming for BBQ, they don't turn up. I'm normally gracious, but i have no patience for people who play punk with me. And they're adults!!!  We have good conversation topics with the rest of the guys. There's a Turkish, Moroccean, Albanian, 2 Japanese, Romanian, Malauwian, Sri Lankan, Indian officers who were at the event. All very gracious men and i can tell they miss their family and kids.   I had a very interesting conversation with the Colonel from Albania. He has a 21 yr old daughter who's studying medicine. Before she can be a full fledged doc, she has to study and do her practical for 11 years!!!! wha......and i thought studying medicine in NUS took donkey years! I can see from the sparkle in his eyes whene he mentions his daughter. Major Yoshi from India has 2 daughters - 2 yrs and 8 yrs - and he calls home everyday. His girls don't understand that he's thousands of miles away from home; they think he's just in another town in India. Then there's Capt Roderick from Milauwee. He's the only one that i have more contact with 'cos sometimes we send him back to BOQ (army barracks). He's a playboy who likes to hang around at Sierra Vista's only bar. He's going to be someone up and coming in his country. Why? He's the only one they send for ALL overseas courses! Call that unfair but i guess when u come from a developing country and his brother-in-law is the ambassador to US, there's "favour".  My funny man is Major Hassan from Morocco. He's doesn't speak much, but his antics and one liner are super funny. Dar was telling me that he was at the IMSOL office checking email. He typed in Al Quaeda on the Web just for interest sake. Then the IMSOL officer walked in and Major Hassan panicked. He tried closing down the webpage but just couldn't. Know what he did? He took up a paper and put it up on the screen. The IMSOL guy looked at him in a wierd way. Roderick was there and witnessed the whole thing. Once the IMSOL guy left, Hassan literally begged Roderick to help him get out of the website. Wah......comedic scene man! But he could have got into mega trouble, man!!!    Dar is a lucky man. He's the ONLY one with family with him here.Everyone starts talking about the Las Vegas trip in 3 weeks time. They r so excited. I'm glad that i can join this bunch of officers.   Sunday, 20 Jun  It's Father's Day! I stayed up the whole night yesterday to write a card to Dar. His first time celebrating Father's Day. We get up early and i cook him French Toast and Eggs. Then we decide to drive up to Tucson for some Anniversary gifts. Our 2nd wedding anniversary is on 22 Jun, this Tues.  Dar gives me a budget of US$200, but i told him it's too much. I end up buying clothes for Gerald instead. We head to a formal dress shop and Dar buys me an evening dress and a pair of very nice black pants. He's so sweet! Sigh......what to get for him?    We are at Tucson Mall, a place with 200 over shops. But still, it doesn't look busy like Taka or even Junction 8. Gosh.....i miss Orchard Orchard AGAIN!!! anyways, at each shop i go, i see clothes that i know Bea, Faith, Sappho, Pea, Stacia would like! Chia lat....if i draw up a shopping list, i think majority of stuff would be things i would like to buy for them. early Christmas gifts?  It's about 2 hrs drive home, so to help keep Dar awake, we start talking about the possibility of getting a maid when we get home. Sigh...it's going to be extra cost again. But the main concern we have is having a stranger is our home. Definitely NOT comfortable with that. After discussing we make up our mind. The first 2 months, the maid and GG will go to his parents' place. That way, my father-in-law can keep an eye. Then once the maid proves herself trustworthy, she can stay at home with GG. but i'll still get my dad to drop by unexpectedly when he's in S'pore. must pray for a good maid!   I know what to get for Dar. Since he's in his golfing craze now, i tell him he can buy any golf stuff for US$100. He comes home and surfs Ebay for golf clubs. Wah...buying stuff at Ebay is super exciting and cheap.   GG learns how to sit up already!!!! And he loves trees, BUT only during the day. when we're out at night, he would cry if he sees swaying trees. Hmmmm....wonder why. He's getting to be a maestro when it comes to eating cereal. Very tidy kid, but whoa! he eats super fast! Got to think of more veg/fruits for him to eat. His poo is quite hard for his age and each time he's in the process of poohing, his face turns super red. Worried that his veins may pop out!  It's becoming a routine for GG to sleep with us in the middle of the night. He'll be in his playpen at first, then at about 5am, he'lll start making some sounds. Dar would carry him to our bed and we'll snuggle together. Very nice, but i always wake up with sore shoulders and back. Worried that i'll squash our son, so i curl up into a ball at one corner.

      I must send out another card to Ben/Lydia. The first one i sent 2 weeks ago never reached them. Sigh....looks like the card and red packet is not going to reach them before the wedding. I wonder how excited they are :)  Dar's in the "business" of buying and selling golf clubs on Ebay. He'll get a cheap deal and then resell it to someone else. So today, i become his "post woman" going to UPS to send one set of golf clubs to Florida.  I then bring son to Target. I see many cheap clothes that i like!!! Must come here again before we go home. At the infant section, we get a Classical CD for Gerald to listen to. Must start instilling a love for music in GG's life now.

      It's Friday, 25 Jun. But on the diary, it's going to be today's date. Oops....forgot (actually lazy) to update again. i can hear someone going "snh snh snh"  Dar is busy preparaing a very impt paper over the weekend. The International STudents are given 4 days to complete a battle plan, drawing up maps, coming up with strategy to ambush terrorists. Very cool! My dear husband is planning to complete it in less than 24 hrs. So on Fri morning, he's at the kitchen table, slowly and steadily doing it. I help him to colour some maps....think i'm coloured blind though. He keeps telling me there's blue colour, but i say "where got?"  To minimise disruption, i bring GG to Walmart and to the Post Office. I buy for him a new walker!!! It's super colourful and he absolutely loves it. Took the digital camera to the pharmacy to print some pix to send home. Mum says she wishes there were printed pix so she can put in her office. She's going to be very surprised when she receives them next week in the mail!!  It's Sat at this time now. Dar gives Ben a call. Just in time, 'cos Ben was still sleeping. I then gave Lydia a call and she was just about to start her make up. I hesitate to call her 'cos don't really know her, but after i put down the phone, i'm glad i called. I want to put what i learnt at the women's meeting to practice. "Friendship is not something that u seek to gain, but something that u seek to bless".  Turn back the clock to 22 Jun It's out 2nd wedding anniversary. We go to Outback Steakhouse and have a very nice dinner. It's the same on as Perth, except that we can't throw nut shells unto the floor. GG is very good thruout dinner. In fact after feeding him milk, he falls asleep. I placed his head on my lap. Dar and i talked about our 2 years of marriage. Time flies man!!! We're getting old. He eats a super big Ribeye Steak and i settle for fish. As usual, we over-order and can't finish our meals. I drink a super delicious frozen lime margarita...oohhhhhh......super super nice!!!  Sun, 27 Jun Church day! I think i'm beginning to enjoy myself more at Mountain View AOG. now my body swings to the music when we worship. Pst Larry talks about trials and it's very good. One thing sticks out : we MUST learn to cultivate patience that endures.....perseverance is not the end thing that we must have at the end of the trial. Maturity IS the one  Pst Larry shared a sudden news about a church member suddenly going home to the Lord. A 40 yr old man who had just returned from preaching at another church and his kids were still away at teens camp. How is the wife and the 4 kids going to take it? We know that he's with the Lord, but sometimes, i wish God could grant me some "interview" time for me to ask him such questions.  Juanita Adamson walks over to me and asks me to help teach 2 classes on Wed to teens. I agreed, but after awhile, my heart starts pumping fast. What to teach? Who's the audience? Will they take to me? And frankly, the MAIN thing that worried me was :" My spiritual life here is not so good now. HOW?" I tell Dar my concern about God not being able to use me 'cos i haven't been a faithful servant. I must start getting my act right!  We get a dinner invitation to Art's place. He's a filipino retired Navy officer who's from San Diego. He and his wife are retiring in Sierra Vista (i still can't understand why anyone would want to retire here!!!).  We eat very nice Filippino home cooked food and also get to meet Art's son and daughter-in-law. His next door neighbours are also invited. We talk about S'pore, Baseball, babies...etc.....it's a very warm feeling to know that u're among genuinely nice ppl.  Art's house is HUGE. it's about 10000 sq feet (the size of SP's Pasir Panjang place) and it only costs US$180 000! after conversion, that's almost the price of our Sengkang flat! Wah liao!!!! For that size of house in S'pore, it'll be almost 5 million dollars!!!  In the car after leaving Art's place, Dar asks if i think we're ever going to migrate. I tell him that i won't rule out the idea, but if i do migrate, it'll be either Perth or Melbourne.    Mon, 28 Jun Jun's almost coming to an end now. Another 17 more days before the Las Vegas trip. I'm so excited! Like a little girl, i kept asking Dar how many sets of clothes we should pack, what should we bring, the sights we going to take in......aiyoh....grow up!!  Dar's finished his assignment! I'm very proud of him. In fact, this morning, we went to Tombstone, a little town about 25 miles away. It's a cowboy kind of thing - a town where Wyatt Earp was. I like looking at the old buildings and we also watched the reenactment of how Wyatt Earp was gunned down. Poor GG was too frightened of the gun shots that he cried.  The whole day, GG was cranky. He's usually very good in the day, but today, he kept crying and didn't want to be left alone. Last night, he woke up at 2am and didn't go back to sleep till 3am. I cried and prayed to God. I want to be a patient mother, but sometimes, he simply isn't making life easy for me.  I go to the gym and we do kick boxing and abs today. I love the perspiration trickling down. It's super chiok! Dar brings GG to the driving range with him.  However, when Dar picks me up, he has a black face. Never seen him so angry with GG before. Apparently, GG kept crying non-stop! Sigh....it's going to be a long night again. I'm definitely going to ask the pead when i get back about GG's wierd crankiness.  My bro calls me from S'pore. We had a long chat and as usual, we have our usual nonsense banter about girls, him growing up etc. We start talking about serious stuff like studies, Wei Quan, time mgt. He's moving out of the guardian's place in Perth and will stay with his church friends. Miss him lots. Next time we going to see him will be in Dec for X'mas, then he'll go back for summer sch. Next week, he and my parents will be going NZ for skiing with some close family friends. Then he'll return to Perth.  GOing to watch some DVDs now. The Blockbuster selection here isn't THAT fantastic, but we must make do

      I'm so happy!  Dar came back with very good news. The assignment that he was slogging on Fri and Sat....he ace it!!! to get 100%, he needed to get 164 marks. but the instructor was so impressed with him that he gave him 183 points!!!!  it was a grp project, but dar chose to do it by hiimself 'cos there are some irresponsible int'l students who won't put in their fair share of work. true enough...those saudis didn't turn up for grp discussion and their partners were pissed at them.   last night, i went into ebay AGAIN! i've become an ebay junkie!!! i bid for a gucci bag, from US$100 to US$150, but stll got outbid at the very last minute. argh.....but it was super "gan cheong" at the last 5 minutes. cos there were only 2 of us bidding and we were to up the price. really liked the bag....and it was cheap too 'cost it's about $500 at retail.  so i bid for a Coach bag instead. didn't want another gucci bad 'cos many ppl have already. plus Coach is quite sophisticated.....for older ppl like me lar. so i bid for a black hobo bag and got it for US$128. so excited!!!!  Oh, forgot to update that Dad and Mum went HK and Shenzhen for holiday. Wah....according to my dear "lao pa", they ate so much that they put on weight when they got back! And the massage!!!!! Dad says it's $5 for an hour!!!!!! Wah.........i want to go!!!! And the shopping there? AWESOME for mum.......before they left, i asked her to buy some "branded" bags for me. They got me an LV bag, Gucci bag and a Coach wallet. The pictures they sent me on the bags looked ok. But the LV one i didn't like. Too loud, not my style.   Read in an article that babies who suddenly turn more fussy and have more sleepless night are going to teeth soon. Maybe that explains GG's crankiness. We get angry when he cries for no reason, but we cannot stay angry with him for long. One look at his angelic face, and our heart softens  Another 15 more days to Las Vegas...so excited!!!

      Gosh, it's been 8 days since i last updated AGAIN...story of my procrastinating life ...  GG had his first tooth! or rather, the first jagged edge of his tooth is noticeable now. I'm hoping for the best and keeping my fingers crossed that all the fussiness that the children's medical journal states about first tooth, will not surface. Well, he HAS been more fussy but in recent days, he's calmed down lots. Although we r still quite vexed about him crying his lungs out at night and ONLY when he's at home. chia lat....maybe we need to walk the malls till they close to appease my dear son.....  Dar finished sch super early yesterday! I picked him up at 2:30pm!!! We remarked "forget about having such an easy lifestyle in S'pore" - i mean.....u go to work at 8am and reach home by 3pm????? wishful thinking. but i will NEVER trade in the hectic lifestyle i have in S'pore for anything....unless we migrate to DownUnder after my dear hubby retires at 42 :))  was online with Quek for a looonnnggg time yesterday morning. it was very nice just chatting and talking about ministry and his future plans. each time i see ppl online, i get excited. that means i'm NOT cut off from the rest of the world.  it was a super long weekend on 2 - 5 Jul. think (my forgetfulness is getting the upper hand now)we went Nogales, Mexico on Sat with another of Mel's classmate. Crossing over the border to get into Mexico ws super easy; didn't even have to go thru customs. just had to cross thru a gate and presto! u're in Mexico. we did lots of walking.....had 2 huge blisters on my feet. Didn't buy anything. They had big pasar malams but things were expensive. It's a very spanish like culture there. And then on the hills above us, we could see homes built precariously over the edge. I wonder how they get water and sanitation.   I see many kids begging on the streets. Mel is carrying GG, and i reach out to hold his tiny fingers when i see these young tots running after me for money. We r definitely blessed. Wonder if these kids ever tasted McDonald's, eaten an ice cream cone.....BUT one thing's for sure, they play in the dust, get hot and sweaty and hose themselves down with water. Unlike Singaporean kids who only get to play in confined spaces......  Dad calls us in the evening. Ha....he misses GG again. we tell him that there's a possibility of us going phoenix tmr since it's the long weekend. We talk about their coming trip to NZ ...... they'll be in 2 caravans..One for dad, mum and bro...the other for the Chen family (6 of them). Dad says if it's too cramped for them, the kids may bunk in their caravan. I laughed!!! Bro doesn't exactly like the kids......so imagine his shock when he's told he needs to share his bed!!!! ooohhh.......can imagine the look on his face.....priceless!!!!  Sun/Mon 4 - 5 Jul  It's Independence Day here! We head for Phoenix and we decide to visit other malls. I go crazy at the Scottsdale Fashion Square. There's so many stuff here to buy. Hmmmm....in order not to let Mel spoil me, i withdraw my own money from the bank. Sigh......can see money flying away...  I buy 4 shirts from Gap and 2 jeans from Polo Ralph Lauren. Ohh.....i nearly died from my excitement at seeing all these stuff. If not for the coming Las Vegas trip, i think i would have bought more clothes!!! Mel then asks if i've thought about how we're going to bring back my stuff. Aiyoh.....let's think about that when the date comes nearer lar!!!  We wanted to catch the fireworks but looking at the massive jam and the crowds, we changed our mind. maybe we can see it from the hotel room. didn't manage to catch it, but we watched it on the TV  Wed, 7 Jul  It's gym day today! Dar finished sch early, so we come back home and watch TV together as a family. Very very nice feeling. GG sits between us and looks at his toes.......hahaha.....he's got this very "duh" look when he does that :) Love him so much :)  at gym today, we do cardio and boxercise....wha.....we concentrated on our pelvis muscles today and did lots of leg raising in the air exercise.....very very painful.....at the end of the aerobics class, i walked VERY slowly to the car...  I'm sitting in in one of the teen's class today for the second time. Going to take over 2 lessons 'cos the teacher is going away on hols. We had 6 girls today - all 13 yr olds. We did the book written by the AOG churches and today, we tried to cover the lesssons that the girls had missed. It was VERY slow moving and i must admit i nearly fell asleep. The teacher spent the first 20 mins doing admin work!!! Sigh....my mind started drifting to the efficiency of teens ministry on Sun.....and i start comparing.   STOP!!!! i quicly command my brain to stop comparing. i think i can detect a sense of pride......pride causes a downfall......seeing that some of the girls were having difficulties, i help them.   I came home and started rattling off to Dar about how the class went. I mean, for 13 year olds, i'm a little shocked at their English! i mean....this is America and almost EVERYBODY speaks and writes English...do u know that the girls' standard is on par with our 8 - 9 year olds?  Mel then says that in America and Australia, their spoken Eng is very good. But when it comes to written, it's the Singaporeans who do better. Hmmm.....i keep thinking about it the whole night.....

      I'm so excited about the road trip that i've been pestering Dar about what to pack 1 week before! crazy.....but i guess to me, it's a change of normal routine.  The day before (Wed, 14 Jul), i do all the laundry so that we can have fresh clean clothes....i pack a bag and dump all kinds of stuff in it -clothes, toiletries, GG's toys etc...i even bring along his box of cereal! ha...think i'm getting quite seasoned at packing already.  15 Jul!!!! It's a bright sunny day and Togay (pronounced as "Too Gai", the Turkish Liet) comes to pick us up. We had returned our car yesterday evening so that we could save one week's rental. Ooh yah...forgot to update that yesterday i had taught at the Teens girls' class. Since we didn't have the car, Dar and i walked all the way to church. Think it was about 30 minutes walk - good exercise......  We meet at BOQ (the army's accommodation place) for the vans to pick all 18 of us up. I FINALLY get to meet the rest of the international students. The Albanian, the Egyptian, the younger Saudi Arabian.....hmmmm..according to Dar, the Egyptian guy, Ali is quite extreme in his thinking. In class when they talk about the Iraqi war and mention Muslim extremists, he gets upset and will argue with the instructor. Better stay away from him..  We take 2 vans and our driver is Mr Morris - a nice guy BUT don't try playing punk with him. He's got those eyes that will glare thru your soul if u should start your nonsense. In our van, there is Major Yoshi (India), Major Yoshimoto (Japan), Lieut Ali (Egypt), Col (Romania), Maj ..... (Saudi Arabia) and ourselves.   GG was VERY good on the trip to Phoenix. He slept most the time so we had some peace and quiet. Arriving in PHoenix, we stayed at Hampton's Inn. quite disappointed 'cos i was expecting at least a 4 star hotel.....the room didn't even have a fridge!!  ANyway, to cut the whole roadtrip story short, we visited the following places: 1) Capitol Tour (Phoenix is the capitol of Arizona) - Parliament house 2) Hoover Dam 3) Grand Canyon 4) Las Vegas 5) Nellis Air Force Base in Vegas  At Hoover Dam, it was almost 105 Faerenheit!!! We took the tour and went about 50 storeys down into earth to where the generators were located. Very impressive. imagine the height!!! u know, the generators generate elextricity for California, Arizona and certain parts of Nevada....it's one of America's high security area since 9/11. Can u imagine the chaos if the place was bombed???!!!  Grand Canyon was magnificent. However, after walking about 30 mins, the whole place looked the same. I wished we had been there later in the evening so that we could watch the sunset, but itinerary wasn't in my favour. We walked till i developed blisters. GG was in the carrier and Dar carried him all the way. Poor boy got roasted and cheeks were SUPER RED! i&nbsp; bought postcards and magnets at the souvenir shops. THink will give thme to office staff...  Las Vegas was fun but Dar and i feel that it's definitely NOT one place we'll ever come back again. Give us Perth anytime :)  We watched the shows at Treasure Island and The Mirage...not bad, but 'cos i was short, my view of the shows were quite short changed. I ended up stealing glances at the man infront of me, who was trying to video tape the show. It was HOT! it was almost 115 Faerenheit - 42 degrees celcius, i think!  Went shopping again, but not much stuff to buy. prefer Phoenix...bought a pair of Aigner shoes and Nine West shoes....looked around for some Nautica stuff to buy for Dar, but was quite disappointed.   On the trip, i was quite irritated (surprise! i can actually get irritated!!!) by Roderick, the SOuth African guy. He's quite a loud mouthed and likes to tease poor Major Hassan from Morrocco. Then he would announce to everybody about how late the Saudis were in reporting to the van after each tour. I didn't like that 'cos i felt he was just trying to get ppl into trouble! And then, knowing that there were Muslims in our midst, he would point to pork and assure them that there was no non halal food! Dar got quite pissed and told the Muslims that they should ignore Roderick, and if there was pork, Dar would tell them.   Wed, 21 Jul  I've counted down the days and it's 44 more days to going home!!! I'm so excited!!! This evening, i was on yahoo massenger with Yvonne and we talked about our kids. She's convinced me to try to wean GG off his beloved pacifier...it's going to be tough but we have to try. Tmorrow is D Day!!!  I go for my first water aerobics class since the aerobics at the gym has ended. It felt good 'cos i didn't feel the strain on my back and knees. Sigh...old injury acting up again...or is it due to old age?  GG was very good the whole day. We talked (or rather babble) and i pointed out things to him. Each time i changed him, i'll tell him what i was doing. He's SUPER responsive now. Each time when Dar comes home from work, GG will beam at him and give him his widest smile. It always makes Dar's day :) I fed GG mixed vegetables today and he finished the whole bottle! Then i tried yoghurt, but 'cos it was adult kinda of yoghurt, i gave him only a few tsps. But my dear son screamed for more. Hope he doesn't develop a tummy ache.  Son is growing each day. I wonder how different it would have been if i didn't come to the States. Dar says he'll miss out on son son's growing up. True.....  My order for the ab machine arrived and i tried it today. Ha...it has a 30 day back guarantee so i'm going to use till a few days before the Washignton trip then i return. hmmm....am i a cheapskate? don't think so lar....  Fri, 23 Jul  It's finally the end of the work week! Tmr, we're going hiking again...wonder which mountain we're going to conquer :)  &nbsp;

      Monday 26 Jul  Today is D Day for my dear son. We're going to try to wean him off the pacifier. Read in an article in a Parenting mag that babies should be weaned off pacifier when they're 6 mths 'cos their natural desire for sucking would have diminished. chia lat.....GG is already coming to 8 mths! but nvm, i tell Dar that better late than never!  The daytime was good. Although GG did fuss abit each time he was sleepy, i managed to soothe him and talk to him. Eventually he fell asleep. Surprisingly, he slept longer than usual. I guess that's 'cos there's no pacifier to drop out of his mouth, thus awakening him.  Night was bad...really bad....He's usually cranky at nights, and now w/o the pacifier, it's worse. he cries and stops, cries and stops. Dar says that i shouldn't push him too much. Sigh.....the baby book says that cold turkey is often the best but most difficult. Maybe i'm too ambitious? Think tmr.....we'll start off with NO pacifier during the day, then when it comes to bedtime, i'll allow GG his pacifier treat.   Was online with Von for a loonnnggg time ..... envious of how her Seth doesn't cry at all! when he's tired or hungry, he'll just push and whimper. But i'm not going to compare. Every baby is different. So we were talking about our sons' development and wishing how sometimes, we could have more time to ourselves!   Oh, forgot to add that mum called on Sun night. She says she misses US!!!!!! usually she would just say "i miss my grandson", but this time she confesses that she hopes we come back sooner! Made my day :) We talked about everything under the sun - our trip to Vegas/Grand Canyon, GG's teething, GG's feeding routine, my eldest aunt's hospitalisation, how she's going to try to see if she can get the maid before we come back so that she can be trained etc.....could hear Dad in the background asking Mum to ask us questions!  Tuesday, 27 Jul  I send Dar to work and head for the car rental co. Going to extend our rental and ask if we could have the central lock repaired. It's kinda hard trying to unlock the back door, while carrying a baby. The lady went out of her way to help and i was very impressed. It's not very often that u get good customer service in the States. i can attest to that with regards to the phone co and a previous car rental co.  I parked in a No Parking space! the landlord had to come get me to remove the car. Funny how i've been parking there for so long that i didn't even notice the sign!!! my brain is too preoccupied with getting GG in/out of the car seat. The landlady watches GG while he naps while i run to remove the car. Whew!  Today's water aerobics exercise! i'm so excited...wish it could be more often.....like how the water is around my body and though i'm exercising, i'm not feeling the strain on my back and knees. Hope Dar's shoulders/neck is better. He was complaining of aches and pains last night, and in the middle of the night, woke up with cramps on his back shoulders!   &nbsp;

      Another 33 days to go before i leave Arizona! Last night, i couln't get myself to sleep cos my mind was replaying all the exciting things that have happened back home. Very soon, i'll be part of it all again!  GG's finally weaned off the pacifier during the day ONLY. Think i've been too hard on him, thinking that i can quickly get him to forget the pacifier. Now, we only give it to him in the late evening and before he sleeps. But good news! he sometimes spits out the pacifer when we give him and during the night, that&nbsp;small but powerful gadget will drop out of his mouth! I can smell victory!!!  My dear son has been getting stronger on his arms, so now i put him on the tummy when i'm playing with him. He'll hold him up for awhile and attempt to crawl. Well, he nearly succeeded, except that instead of going forward, he'll go backwards!!! Funny sight.  Been trying to take pictures of his teeth....but he's a cheeky little imp (our latest nickname for hime). When he sees us holding the camera, he'll shut his mouth. Sigh........there goes my plan of putting those toothy grin pictures in my album!  Dar hurt his shoulder blade in a bad sleeping posture. I'm guessing that it could also be aggravated by golf! So i tell him "NO more golf for u until we go home"!   Yesterday evening, i went for my water aerobics class. The instructor gave me extra blocks to ensure that i won't sink. The past few lessons, the back float that i had tied to my waist didn't seem to help. In fact, thruout the classes, i was trying my hardest to float in 8" of water!!! She remarked to the rest of the class that it's 'cos i didn't have the fats to float! Rubbish .........  We drove to Walmart for a walk last night. We wanted to try out a new technique of putting GG later to sleep at night. Past few nights, he's been waking up and refused to sleep. He would attempt to crawl around and babble very loudly in the middle of the night! On Wed, he stayed up from 3am to 4:30am!!! Couldn't ignore him 'cos he started crying....  While driving there, an ambulance sounded its siren and all the cars had to give way to it, even cars on the opposite side of the road! Dar remarked that if this happened in S'pore, cars would get behind the ambulance so that they could travel faster!!!! Ugly S'porean habits .........  We're going Tucson tomorrow! The IMSOL is organising a trip to the Space Museum and then after that, a 2 hr shopping at Park Mall. Must get Pearlyn's bikinis!!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Tuesday 3 Aug  Hi Bloggie  It's a good day today. Why? I've restarted reading Purpose Driven Life (aim to finish it by the time i reached Home Sweet Home) and today in lesson 5, i read about how everything in life is a test from GOd. even small things like household chores, driving at the correct speed, taking care of my husband and son.......this phrase stood out "Character is both developed and revealed by tests, and ALL of life is a test". God constantly watches my response to people, prob, disappointment and even the weather!  Yesterday, i got abit upset with Mel. we were supposed to leave for the supermarket earlier as the black clouds were closing in. However, he wanted to leave later 'cos there was a live golf tournament. Needless to say, there was a downpour! I ignored him as he sheepishly tried to apologise for not leaving earlier.  So today as i was reading the book, i did alot of thinking. What's God writing in his little book of observations? "Wendy got upset over a little issue" "Tsk Tsk Tsk"........  Sappho replied my email and updated on how life's been for her. After reading, i closed my eyes and tried picturing how stressed and tired she was. Told Dar about the email and nearly cried when i told him that it was as if i could sense her emotions. Her birthday's coming....maybe we could send something to her to make her day???  We prayed as a family last night. It was very sweet cos GG was still awake. Whenever one of us prays, he would look at us and babble. It was as if he could understand what we were saying! I thanked God for blessing us with such a son. Dar commented that GG's actually a very very "guai" boy who hardly cries in the day. Looking back, my dear son has indeed grown - in size and in character.  He's always laughing and playing by himself and it's true of what Dar says. GG hardly cries in the day. It's only the nights that he gets cranky. Guess 'cos i play too much with him already.  U know how at the end of each lesson in the book, there's a question to consider? Well...in the question that asked "what are the greatest matters God has entrusted to me?" My answer is Gerald, my husband, my work, my family, my ministry...........i MUST be accountable to God  Sunday 1 Aug  Today, we had a special treat. A family who has been serving in Turkey for the last 8 years returned for a holiday and shared their testimony. Did u know that in Turkey, there r 70 million ppl but only 2000 believers? And the govt is cracking down on churches? But amazingly, there have been stories of how God has been revealing himself thru dreams and visions to Turkish ppl. The man shared of how God spoke to 2 friends on separate occasions. But 'cos they didn't want to be jailed, they didn't say anything. Until one day, one of them let slip that he had a dream and the other was amazed  and also started sharing! They then went to a trusted Muslim teacher to ask and was shocked when the teacher also said that God had spoken to him!!! Wah........  Art and Taisy came to us and asked when we were leaving. They looked very disappointed to know that it'll be soon...Art sees himself as GG's grandfather. I like this Fillippino couple who has opened their homes and hearts to us.  We rented 2 DVDs - Missing and another one with Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins (can't remr the title). Had a very nice quiet afternoon with Dar, eating fried chicken (there goes my diet) and watching the movie.  Another 3 more weekends b4 we fly to Washington . To make the wait of the 3 wkends seem shorter, Dar proposes that we drive to Tucson next week and then to Phoenix the following week. I'm excited!  Dar's birthday is coming. Chia lat......what to get for him? It's very very difficult to buy things for him (for that matter, it's difficult to buy things for man!!!). He doesn't like shirts, watches, cologne etc......doesn't even want to go out for dinner. Maybe i'll cook something special....i don't know. He let slip that he wants to get something for himself b4 going home, but refuses to tell me what it is. Argh!!!!!
