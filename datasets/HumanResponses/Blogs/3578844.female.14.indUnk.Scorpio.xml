Since Mr. webb ALWAYS talks while we're taking an important test, I wanna be like blow it our ure ass...we don't wanna know if u think mesopotamia is a good band name!! 1...2..SHHH (or in my case, shut the hell up, chickenshit)  Well, Matt was nice enough to give us his notes to photocopy like 20 min before the exam...yeah it took us like 15 min just to figure out how to make the copier stop puking out green paper, cuz that just might be too obvious...ya know?¿  We were like shaking and then we all got hernias b/cuz Mr. fathead over here decided to give us an essay question that @least 6 ppl IMed me asking if I knew how to do it...nooooo...well I'm gonna go let my ulcer heal...leave some comments on this one, people!! ~xoxo Shannaroo xoxo~
