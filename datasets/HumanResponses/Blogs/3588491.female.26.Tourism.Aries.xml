      when it comes to trying to lose weight, i've been at it for   YEARS   ..i've spent   MONTHS & WEEKS   on every diet! ..i've spent   DAYS   at the gym! ..and   HOURS & MINUTES   at the treadmill.. ..but it's the   SECONDS   at the dinner table that usually gets me!  "search for the hidden beauty in all that surronds you with, even if it is a bunch of pricks!"

      when i look into the mirror and the only one there is me.  every freckle on my face is where it's suppose to be.  and i know my creator didn't maek no mistakes on me.  my face, my thighs, my hips, my eyes, im loving what i see.  im not the average girl from your video.  and i ain't built like a supermodel.  but i learned to love myself unconditionally because i am queen.  my worth is not determined by the price of clothes.  no matter what im wearing i will always be me.           "..knowing what you want and how to get it.  it's a lifestyle.  a state of mind."

      .if i could .i would .give this world and twice more .turn the stars into diamonds so i can give it to you .walk around the moon just so i can be besides you .sometimes the things i do it may never be understood .but remember if i could .i would .make you understand .settled with you and make plans .see our future together holding hands .just wanna come out and hope this will be some kind of bliss .when we both kiss .and hope we won't miss .our life and our little hugs .if i could .i would .let you see this heart .never be apart from you . i guess what i'm trying to say is i love you .it's a start

      i miss love, love like the heavens type love. ..i'd give you my soul if i could be in your arms type love. what ever happened to it? i feel like its non-existent within our society, or maybe it's just not as abundant -  regardless, it's just not enough... love is innocence.  relationship are selfish. lust at first sight? then i guess i've forgotten what love is. lust is real, but not realer than love, not as pure as love - love transcends. saying that you love them for they are is about as arbitrary as saying you love them for who they are not. ..i'd rather have someone tell me they love em wholeheartedly, but don't know why.. to me that's real.. love.

      there is not enough matter to fill the void. i lose my breath when i speak my dreams, and lose my mind when i sleep. it is my soul that you see in the sky, my voice that illuminates in the night.. i am freedom when i write.. i am free.  regardless of obstacles, my tree of words will plant roots in the stone that shatter concrete when i rock and concrete blocks from empires only to be brought to their knees like children in prayer, i am the hope that one day voices will speak louder than gun shots that echo my block.
