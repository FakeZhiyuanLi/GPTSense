I still haven't gotten over meeting Michael and when I said I was Melanie Berk, he went, "Ooooohh..." Like, "So you're the one..." Creepy. But not as creepy as Mrs. Hood. *Insert Shudder Here* Oh, and Walt, I don't feel like replying to your email. So yes, the redneck's name was one of those. I think. Yeup.  Peace out hehe, Much love guys,                                                                                                                                                     `~*Mel*~`

       You know, I've been thinking. I know that nearly all of you know of the pivotal show/manga that sparked all anime called  Astro Boy . Why does he never wear a shirt? It's just wrong.

       i was looking at random profiles today, and i never knew how many people love manga as much as I do. It's amazing. Japan is slowly taking over the U.S. culturally. i love ramen.

       My mom really needs to get up to date with the latest things. She doesn't have the slightest idea what a manga is.  she knows theyre books, and thats about it. whenever  i am bothering her, she says,"Michael, go read your Mangos!" mangos! My god!
