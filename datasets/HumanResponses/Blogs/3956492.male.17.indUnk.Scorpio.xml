      I am now addicted to those dino comics, I've read every single one, and have even started making some of my own. I have become very sad and have sent in my own to the site and it is now on fan art section.

      this is without doubt my favourite (and so far only) web comic I've read. It's fantastically amusing and deserves a medal. Thank you.  urlLink http://www.qwantz.com

      After that rather over serious entry I feel the need to quote a song I once wrote for my graphics project. This is Umbrellas Anonymous with Blibble. "Blibble blibble blibble blibble, blibble blibble blibble squiggle, blibble blibble blibble blibble, blibble blibble squiggle!" There, I feel less serious now, although I have possibly proved how crazy I really am.

      Sometimes I guess we all make mistakes. And I believe Nick when he says he wasn't getting off with Holly, even if it really looked like they were at the time. I haven't known Nick for a large amount of time, but I reckon he's a decent type of guy, and he wouldn't do that to Baird. As for Baird himself, I think he'll be fine with the whole Holly thing AND be able to stay friends with her, which is good. Now all he needs is good news come August 19th. At the end of the day, maybe that's what we all need.

      i just realised i had no work or school until saturday, so i kinda realised i need to learn to chill. It's hard to relax when you've been working so hard though. It's hard to get your brain to switch off, and for you just to stop. I keep thinking i should be doing something. I need to learn to chill.

      i just noticed that this blogg thing is running on american time and days. so i actually posted this on saturday, and yet it shows up as being posted on sunday. why is that? y do the americans feel that they are the most important people in the world? does GMT not mean anything to them? I guess not. Nothing means anything to any american, except money, and what they own. If i'm being stereotypical then let me. because that's how it seems to me. i'm sure there may be some sane people living in the states, but until i meet one my stereotype will have to stay i'm afraid.

      Ok... Amazon.co.uk seems to be unable to take my money. I want to give it to them, I begged them, I pleaded, but no, my money is still in my account and my back won't let amazon anywhere near it. Which is kinda scary. Amazon is a top company that works very well, but at the moment I'm beginning to hate them. I just want to pay for the videos I ordered, that's all! And they won't even send me the final one in my collection until I pay them. Which I really really want to!!! So that means that unless my bank allows Amazon to take my money I will have to let amazon take my videos, snatch them back from me and send in the people with battering rams. Could be exciting though will probably involve a wimpy guy in a florescent coat taking them from me as I sheepishly hand them back out of my doorway. So I won't have my videos anymore. Also my parents are annoying me already which brings me finally to the point. Bad news comes in threes. Parents. Lack of Videos. And with results day two days away what could the third piece of bad news possibly be? Fuck.

      They eat at it, they bite it, they hack away at it until it's running slow and has scary links to porn all over it. But at the end of the day, why do sad little men who have never had girl friends get off on the fact that they've just fucked up your PC? I have no idea why they bother. They're obviously talented computer programmers, so why not put that knoledge to good use? Come on! Design Pong 2, save the plannet or run for president. But for god's sake do NOT ask me any more times if I want to join your god forsaken casino!

      my parents have been on holiday (with my lil bro's) for over a week now, and to be honest I kinda miss them. I thought I'd just be able to have loads of fun but its kinda not as cool as i thought it'd be. The good news is I've got loadsa friends all around me. Yay! AND the reading festival is getting very very close!
