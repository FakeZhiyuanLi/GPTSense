      Another year, another Father's Day that will pass where I won't get to see my beautiful angel Arianna.  You see I am the father of a beautiful 2 yr old, but her mother, who seems to have this weird vendetta against me, refuses to let me see her.  Now I have the court papers that show I have joint custody and my visitation rights are listed as well.  But the last time I actually seen my beloved daughter, she was roughly 15 months.  Now many are probably asking why is this happening to you?  Are you a dead-beat dad who don't pay child support or medical insurace? NO!  Do you make an effort to call and try and see her?  YES!  I don't know why her mother is doing this to me...I don't even understand why this is happening to me.  I feel I've suffered enough.  Let me explain:  I was raised in the projects of Brooklyn.  My family broken and broke, my father had a new wife, a new life & a soon to be new family.  I am the first born out of 6!(2 from his 1st marriage and 4 from the second)  I am named after the bastard and yet, to this day, I am still fighting (somewhat) for my father's attention.  He bestowed upon me a gift I would not trade in for anything in the world, the gift of art!  I was born an artist and I will die an artist...that's my motto.  Since I could remember, I always placed my dad on a pedestal.  He was GOD to me, literally, I mean this man could do no wrong.  But yet, he refused to pay child support, he made promises he NEVER kept & he just forgot me & my brother existed.  As the years passed on, it was still hard for me to "let go" of my father & whenever he forgot us, I rebelled against the one person who TRULY loved me.  I became cold, I shut out the world & I refused to care about anything. I can still remember the day me & my bro stood waiting by the window for my father from 8am to 10pm!  Well I was still awake, my brother cried himself to sleep (in my arms).  My moms weeped for us as well & it killed her to see me just sitting there, cold, meticulously waiting for a person she knew was not going to show up.  I was angry at the world & at GOD because I knew I loved someone who will never love me the way I loved them.  I remember the invites I sent for my various achievements: public school, junior high school, high school graduations, etc. & looking out to see an empty chair each & everytime.  It hurts & still burns to this very day.    But on February 26, 2001 all that changed.  This was the day my beloved angel, my princess was born.  Mi renita, Arianna, my darling butterfly was born & the angels sounded their trumpets with jubilation (I swear).  After that day, my heart & soul was opened & repaired.  I knew I had a reason for living, I knew why life was so great!  Me & her mother even let our past be our past & realized that we BOTH need to be there for our daughter.(Or so I thought)  Things were going smoothly, me & my daughter were inseparable, me & her mother, however, was not seeing eye to eye on alot of things.  You see my daughter's mother (and I will keep her nameless....for now) has an overbearing mother.  Well we will call her a "spoiler", to this type of mother their children can do no wrong.  She already had planned out my daughter's next 5 yrs of her life & I will be damned if ANYONE tries to say what my daughter can & cannot do.(other than her mother or myself that is)  It's funny because, she didn't want me to take my daughter to Brooklyn to see my family, because as she said, "Brooklyn is too dirty & too ghetto for MY grandchild!"  Of course, the New Yorker/Brooklynite in me wanted to kick this bitch in the earlobe for her ignorance, but I maintained my composure & let it go.  Then came April 3, 2002, MY BIRTHDAY, the plan: my daughter's moms drops off our child to see her daddy on his birthday, my family comes to visit from NYC & all is happy since the fams gets to see the baby & I get to have my daughter (ALONE) on my birthday.  Shit, even my fams in Florida FLEW UP & came to see me and my angel.  Well I will ALWAYS remember this day as the end of the rest of my life, because this was the last time I have seen my child.  The day started out well, Arianna's mom came promptly at 7am to drop her off.  My fams showed up roughly about 12pm, and spent some much needed time with my daughter.  Then, the nightmare began, about 4pm I get a phone call from Arianna's mom & she is very upset.  I ask her what's wrong & she tells me she needs to pick up Arianna today & not tomorrow as planned.  Of course I am pissed & promptly ask her why, she doesn't answer, instead she hangs up the phone!  So here comes Arianna's mom all pissed & still refuses to explain to me why she is upset. (come to find out she was upset because a "good friend" of hers told her that my roommate was at my house when she really wasn't) I tried to calm Vi...oops almost let her name out! (evil grin) But I tried to calm her down to no avail and that was the last time I saw my angel.    I have pleaded with Arianna's mom, sent her letters, called non-stop (still do), emails & ims...NO RESPONSE.  Alot of people say I should just go there with the police since she is in violation of the court order, but put yourself in my position.  Would you really want your child to see her mother being handcuffed & arrested?  Think of the emotional attachment she has to her mother...think of the emotional trauma she will suffer if she was to see this.  This has led me to realize I am cursed and will never be happy...ever.  I am at an empass, caught between a rock & a hard place, limbo.  I am damned if I do & damned if I don't...cursed.  All I wanted was my father's love, which I never received & all I wanted was to give a father's love, but that will probably never be...  Until next time....

      Since I didn't mention it on my previous entry, I've decided to share with the world something that only a few handful know about me. I suffer from what was diagnosed as Sudden Death Nightmare Syndrome (I am  not  making this up) or as its commonly known as "Night Terrors".  Basically in lay man's terms it means you suffer from nightmares on a constant basis & end up with insomnia (which I can proudly say I do have)& you can actually die from a night terror.  So every night before I finally fall asleep, usually around 1 or 2 am (sometimes chemically induced) I try to think happy thoughts.  I am basically trying to trick my mind to give me pleasant dreams.  I think about my family, my daughter, my life as a whole.  But this doesn't work, instead they make the nightmares worse.  I had a very vivid nightmare last night (I always tend to remember every detail) & I thought I'd share it with you all, all interpretations are welcomed.    This is my nightmare...  It all starts as a recurring nightmare I've had since I was a child, with me walking with my younger brother Seb to the "M" train in Brooklyn (this is an elevated train), as we are getting to the turnstyles I hear a muffled voice (think slow motion) screaming out "There he is!"  When I turn to see what's going on, I see 15 angry black teens running towards me and my bro, I turn to my bro and yell, "RUN!"  We jump the turnstyles and board the train right on time since the "gang" just missed the train...Now, this is where everything gets very weird so bear with me.  As the train continues its path, I asked my bro what that was about and he replied with a "I don't know" shrug.  Then I suddenly realize the train is climbing upwards!  When I look out the window, I realize the train is climbing up a HUGE mountain (think Mt. Everest on steroids!)  The enormity of this mountain is mind boggling and I turn to realize that I am alone on this train!  My bro, the passengers, the conductor & the driver of the train...GONE!  ALL GONE!  My heart races with fear and anxiety not realizing the train is coming to a stop at the top of the mountain.  As I get off the train and onto the platform, I see that same gang waiting for me!  So I decided that I am not going to confront them and get my ass kicked, so I jump off the platform (yes I said JUMP) and run down the mountain. (because as we ALL know this is possible)  As I am still running down the side of the mountain I hear screams and as I look behind me I see an even bigger gang chasing me!  Only this time they are all demons!  Horrible, disfigured and mangled demons, just chasing me.  I get to the bottom of the mountain where my brother is waiting for me asking me, "Where the fuck have you been?!  It's JUDGMENT DAY! Let's get the family and get the fuck out of here!"  So we run to my mom's house and its GONE!  I mean my whole neighborhood is one big fucking crater!  It looked like the devil himself farted and blew my old hangout to shit!  I turn to see my brother is gone also.  Then the nightmare turns weird yet again...when I close my eyes (in my nightmare) and tell myself, "This is a dream, its only a dream!" and remove my hands from my face and open my eyes, I realize I am now in a very dark room with a beam of light just shining from the middle of the ceiling.  I walk in the direction of the light (right ahead of me) and see a figure standing just beyond the light, in the shadows.  I ask the "shadow" who they are and the voice replies, "I am your twin, your better half."  So with that response I am already thinking "PSYCHO".  But I am intrigued, I ask the figure to show themselves to me, the figure moves into the light and its ME!  Only the eyes are pale grey (I have brown eyes), the "twin" is not wearing glasses and the hair, OMG the fucking length of this hair was ridiculous (think old kung-fu flicks, you know them dudes with the long hair).  As I approached my twin, I actually liked the way I looked!  I extended my hand to his and he introduced himself as "Wulf".  He told me he was my "darker" half and he was here to help me become more in touch with my badder half...but as he continued to talk about the history of where he came from, I started to hear a very LOUD beeping sound!  I immediately woke up & as has been the norm as of late, banged my head on the GOD FORSAKEN SLANTED CEILINGS!  I don't know what that nightmare was about, don't ask me because I don't know!    All I do know is I am probably and most likely really fucked up in the head.  I mean seriously, who dreams like this?!  I wish I could interpret my dreams/nightmares whatever they are called.  I mean it wasn't really violent or scary, yet I woke up in a cold ass sweat & my heart was beating 100 mph.  This nightmare really disturbed me only because was this other half "Wulf" a suppressed memory trying to show me something?  Do I have any suppressed anger or depression I don't know about?  And if the former is true, when will it come to light?  These are questions, I will probably never know the answer to.  When the day comes, I only hope I am properly prepared to handle the change.  Until next time FREAKS!

      I have never used one of these "BLOGS" to post what goes on in my otherwise screwed up brain, but I figured what the hell, I ain't got anything to lose except my self dignity, my life...well just my dignity otherwise, but its my world otherwise so I figured why not...You know I find it rather interesting how I have come this this point in my life where I am seeking more but wanting less.  Allow me to clarify, at the ripe old age of 27, I am seeking what only a handful can actually grasp...PURPOSE (Please keep the "Matrix" comments to a minumum) Seriously now, I wonder what I am actually here for?  I mean what PURPOSE do I serve on this planet, in this life?  I tend to wonder about too many happenings and mishappenings lately, but I feel I need a PURPOSE, I need a reason to be here.    See if you can follow me, when we are children, we don't care about anything, just our toys and our food.  When we hit our preteens and teens all we care about is sex, chilling with our friends & partying.  When we hit young adulthood & adulthood, well we still care about sex and partying, but now there are bills and (for some) children, family.  For me, since I could remember, all I really cared about was PURPOSE.  I remember asking my mother when I was 10 yrs old, why I was here?  Her response was that I am acting silly and I should go out and play with my friends (I have since come to the realization that this was her way of getting rid of me so she can have some "alone" time with her man)  I would ask these questions to family, friends, teachers and whoever else would take the time to listen to me ramble.  I was told once by my uncle that I have an old philosopher's soul trapped in me and I am trying to figure out why (damn drunk), my teachers would just brush me off and say to write down what I thought was my purpose in life (damn school system) & my friends could really give two fucks about my questions (damn losers).    But still I seek the answer to my many questions...What is the purpose of me being here?  Why am I here?  What kind of difference can I make to this world?  I try and self meditate and seek the answers within, but I only end up with more questions than answers.  Interesting enough I have answered some of my many questions, and they have produced some great conversation pieces albeit with myself but nevertheless great!  I don't know, maybe I am crazy, maybe I am a genius...I just don't know.  But that is the greatness about life and it's ever changing ways...yes we have questions and yes we can debate the answers until sunrise, but maybe that's what gives us purpose.  Maybe my PURPOSE...OUR PURPOSE is to find the answers to life's many questions...I just don't know.
