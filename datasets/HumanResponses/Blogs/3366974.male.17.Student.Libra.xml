      "No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely be called a dog, sir." "Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!"  Good old Captain Ahab... Finally started reading about him afer 100+ pages. Although it rained for quite a while, I didn't read as much as one would think. Power got knocked out once, but it came back on soon after. That's a good thing too, because when power in our area gets knocked out, we are always the last ones to get it fixed.  &nbsp;

      "I will have no man in my boat," said Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale." By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward." -Moby Dick  Well, read some of Moby Dick today. In town today, we finally got some good basketball games going. It was 2v2 to 10, but you had to win by 2. It was 15-15 until Scotty made a 2 pointer to win, so my team lost 17-15. Then we got 3v3 going, and played that for awhile until these two huge kids came, and it was 4v4, and despite my complaints they insisted on being on the same team so I just went along with it. And, just as I had feared and predicted, they anihilated us. I watched my dream utterly shatter before me as they schooled me.

      "Glimpses do you seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?" &nbsp; Well, I read a bit of Moby Dick today and a little yesterday. Speaking of yesterday, oops! Didn't make a post, I forgot. Wasn't anything worth telling about anyways. I got to thinking, maybe it isn't a good idea to post every day anyways because I'd have 365 posts a year, and that is a lot of damn posts. But, I guess it only shows a week worth at a time. So, hmm.  &nbsp; I went back to the doctor's today, and the verdict is this: I must start taking the full 25 MG pill, instead of half a pill (12.5 MG). That's basically it, exciting isn't it? &nbsp; I went to the fair with Bob, and after walking around for an hour or so we left. I saw some people I knew, but were the stuck up preps. So, basically the fair sucked.

      "All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all - Presbyterians and Pagans alike - for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending." &nbsp; Today, was quite dull. I read a fair bit from Moby Dick, and went uptown a few times. We had spotty showers today, so there wasn't much I could do (outside). I didn't see her (Lauara) cousin today either, could be due to the rain. Or, the simple fact that she doesn't come outside very often. We'll see, she is bound to come out sometime. I don't particulary feel like knocking on her door, especially since I don't know her that well. But, I suppose if I must... &nbsp; That makes me think, at first I didn't know what to think of her (Laura). But now, I can't help but think about her. Hmm... &nbsp; It's the fifth day that I took my medication, and things seemed fine today. I even ate before I went to bed and had no trouble sleeping. I go to the doctor's again on Monday, and from whatI understand they are going to increase my dosage.

      "Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease." -Moby Dick &nbsp; Well, I read&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;bit of Moby Dick today. Yet, I found it hard to find a quote worth posting. Actually, I was outside a lot today. &nbsp; Yesterday, as stated in my previous post, I met a girl who was apparently interested me. Well, I decided that this time, I would go to town and be prepared. So, when I awoke, I did all the usual things one would do. I even shaved, despite the fact that I loathe it. I took a drive uptown to see what was going on, and to my dismay, nothing. After killing some time, I went back uptown where I met up with some friends. We rode around town for a while, and then the girls came back outside. I talked to them, but only breifly. Laura, was going with her cousins to the Military Mess Hall. Why her cousin would even need to go there, I don't know. My friends and I played basketball not too far from there, I won the first three games before finally getting tiped out in the fourth one. I was hoping to talk to Laura some more before she left, but that didn't happen. I saw them leaving a while later, and I decided I'd try to get her email, assuming she has one, or her phone number from her cousin sometime. A thunder storm was upon us though, so I'll have to wait until tommorow, or the next day. &nbsp; My past few posts have failed to mention my progress with Zoloft. So far, besides an itch here or there, and some other symptoms that very well may be sinus related, I haven't noticed any sideffects, except perhaps an upset stomach. Which, odly enough, never seems to bother me in the day, only at night. As you can imagine, that makes it quite uncomfortable when your trying to get some sleep. We'll see what happens in the coming days.

      "...yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them." -Moby Dick &nbsp; It was tough to find a quote that I liked enough to put on here, even though the chapter was very entertaining. But, I barely had the time to read today with all the occurences. &nbsp; First, my day was very typical. Got online, and my good friend Brandon was on. After a while, my other friend Bob got on and we played a few games of Starcraft (Online/Offline PC Game). Then, my day started to pick up. I eventually played some basketball after eating uptown. I noticed to girls riding their bikes, one of which I knew. I debated about inviting them swimming, but didn't. I drove around town for awhile, and ended up running into Andy. I talked with him a while, and went and picked his brother Scotty up to play some basketball. Dylan was skateboarding, like always, and we conned him into playing. We were sweating half to death it seemed, so we ended up going swimming. By the time we got ready, however, we were dry and no longer hot. Thus the pool felt freezing, and we only swam for a mere 11 minutes. Perhaps I have gone in too much detail of the events so far, but I guess it is better this way. Well, I loaded my bike in the back of the truck, which I might add is quite the choir since I have a bed cover, since I decided that riding my bike was a good idea. We ran into dylan again, and we rode around. Sarah and a girl (who I couldn't recognize at the time) were oustide and she said Hi to me, how nice. (only took three times of riding by, lol) Scott and I were playing some basketball at the other park, when some girls walked by. Considering the way they took, I got the feeling that one or both of them might like us. They starting swinging, and that (to me) gave it away. I couldn't help but almost laugh a little. I didn't say anything to them though, at least until they left. I said "later", as if to at least acknowledge their presence. We rode&nbsp;our bikes by them a little while after, and I think one of them side Hi, but I can't be sure. Scott pussed out (ironic that we are both named Scott, I know) and went home at some point. I however, wanted to keep riding my bike for a little while. This, turned out to be a good thing, at least so it seems. Some girl called me by name, and I replied "what?". "Come here" she commanded. I thought about it for a second, and did go over. I knew the girl, her name is Calista, and might I add she is annoying. She introduced me to a girl named Laura, and informed me that she thought I was hot. Gee, how nice. I would myself be pissed if one of my friends did that, but on the other hand, if it didn't backfire, my anger would turn to joy. She (Calista) kept bugging me about various things, all regarding Laura. Quite annoying she is, but she served her purpose yet. Truth be told, Laura is quite pretty. She is only 14, but... oh well. I feel that I took too much of a shy approach to the whole situation. I did talk to her, but not that much. She is staying with her cousin, but she leaves tommorow. Hopefully, I can catch her before she leaves. And this time, not be so damn shy. If not, all is well. I can get her phone number from her cousin. Sorry about rambling, but there was just a lot to tell.

      "The ribs and terrors in the whale,   Arched over me a dismal gloom, While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,   And lift me deepening down to doom.  "I saw the opening maw of hell,   With endless pains and sorrow there; Which none but they that feel can tell-   Oh, I was plunging to despair.  "In black distress, I called my God,   When I could scarce believe him mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints-   No more the whale did me confine.  "With speed he flew to my relief,   As on a radiant dolphin borne; Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone   The face of my Deliverer God.  "My songs forever shall record   That terrible, that joyful hour; I give the glory to my God,   His all the mercy and the power." -Moby Dick  Finally, after several days, I have begun to read the more interesting pages of Moby Dick. The current chapter that I am on (Chapter IX. The Sermon) seems so interesting, that I decided to stop after that last quote. So that tommorow, I may have another interesting quote for my entry.  Today is the second day that I took Zoloft, so far so good. Every once in a while I will feel like there is something wrong with me, but nothing really is. It's just my mind getting the best of me. However, my mind doesn't seem to be messing with me as much as it did for the last medication I took.  I went uptown to play some basketball. At some point, my friend Andy drove up and we chatted for a while. He was telling me about this kid who wanted to fight him, for what reason I do not know. Anyway, he was telling me that this kid, and a friend of his showed up at his girlfriends house when he was there and wanted to fight. Her dad was outside mowing the lawn though, and when he saw he came running. They saw him and took off in their cars. Why is it that this county is full of such pricks? Always wanting to fight for some stupid reason or the other.

      "And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnations of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens."                         -Moby Dick  Lately, I have been reading Moby Dick. That was an excerpt from what I read today, and I believe I'm going to start every day's entry like that from now on.  Today, for the first time, I took Zoloft. So far, I haven't had any sideffects, but it takes a few days for Zoloft to get in your system. Hopefully, all will be well...  "Whatever my lot, thou has taught me to say, it is well with my soul"

      It has been a few months since I officially found out that I (possibly) have OCD and ADD. Well, today I go to the doctors at 2:45 pm again, to hopefully solve my problems.   I should probably explain the events leading up to today, so you have a better idea of what is going on. First, they believed me to have ADD, and they still do. The put me on Concerta, and it seemed to work. However, I refused to take the medication any longer because I felt the side effects were too negative. Turns out, I wasn't even having sideffects from the actual medication itself, but from my own paranoid mind. This is when they concluded that I also had OCD. From what I understand, OCD is common with people who suffer from ADD. OCD, for those who don't know, can be credited to those who are obsessive about something (in the sitcom Friends, Monica is obsessed with cleaning), but that isn't the only symptom. OCD can cause paranoid attacks among other things, and this is what my problem is. I'm overly paranoid when it comes to health issues, and this is my main problem and focus at the moment. First, I must treat my OCD before I can treat ADD. (Since I won't and can't take the ADD medication without having Paranoid Attacks caused by the OCD). Of course, I am paranoid about taking the OCD medication itself, and there are some side effects that scare me. So I didn't take the medication that they presribed for that. It has been a few months since they issued it (Zoloft) for me to take. During that time I have experienced some rather unpleasant Paranoid Attacks, and decided that I would go ahead and take the medication, pending another doctor visit (which is what today's appointment is). In case your wondering what the side effects that I'm worried about are, they are as follows: Sexual Sideffects that may include painful errections, Tremors, and Seizures. There are more minor sideffects, but they aren't bad enough to bother me. They tell me that there is a very slim chance of me actually having any of those sideffects, but it doesn't do much good to ease my mind since there is still a chance, however slim. But, I've decided I'd rather test my fate, because I can't continue to live my life the way I am now. Paranoid Attacks are very unpleasant, and they must stop.  I will update you in a few days on my situation, if I'm still around to report on it.

      It has been quite a while since I made my last post. For that, I apologize (not that anyone reads this). A lot has happened in the nearly two weeks since I made my last entry. I will start off by first mentioning my progress with OCD. After another doctor visit, I have been uped to a 50 MG dosage. I have been taking that for more than a week with no side effects. I still ask questions about stuff, but I seem to spend less time dwelling on it. I haven't asked if my chicken strips from Wendys are fish or anything like that. How one could not know the difference between chicken and fish is beyond me... Cut me some slack here.  Lately, I have been hanging with the kids uptown. Riding my skateboard or my bike around town. The kids uptown are Seth (real name is Isiah), Jordan, Dylan, and Zack. Sometime Kaitlyn will be riding her bike uptown and stop and hang out with us. We never converse however, because her mom is my Uncles ex wife. Funny isn't it? I never talked to her when we were "cousins" either though. She has no blood relation to me, so whatever.  Some incidents that you might find interesting have happened since my last post, so I'll share them with you. The first one that comes to my mind happened just recently. I saw some girl standing outside the Ice Cream Shop, so I rode my bike up to the shop so I could see what she looked like. Well, as I was close to her Seth yelled "Scott, is she hot?" Embarassing and funny in its own right. The gang skated up to the shop and we all were just hanging out there. The girl got in a Blazer and it went around the block and went past us again. As they were right by us, they came to a near stop. The girl was sitting in the passenger seat and smiled. Then they drove away out of sight. I need to start finding out girls phone numbers, because I'm sick and tired of letting them slip through my fingers and out of my life.  An exciting posibility has made itself known to me. My friend Tim might move back to Indiana. You see, Tim and I were best friends for years in grade school before he moved to Texas. Although we didn't keep in touch as much as I thought we would, we still remained friends. He came back up for freshman year, but he ended up moving back to Texas. I left highschool to get homeschooled that same year, before he moved. Well, his dad told him he is moving back up to Indiana. Tim doesn't know if his dad will follow through with it though. If he does that would be cool. One interesting concept about him moving back is the possibility of being able to work out. All my friends up here are lazy and don't care about their appearance. Me on the other hand, would like a six pack and bulging biceps. Tim works out, and he said he has the same problem down in Texas. I never work out, for the very fact I just stated. I need someone like Tim, who isn't lazy, to spot me. Maybe, I'm not sure about this yet, but just maybe I could start taking Taekwondo again. Tim might be able to keep me motivated and having someone along for the ride would make it go by faster (its a 30 minute drive). It would be even cooler if Tim gets homeschooled, then we could work out in the morning and cruise for chicks after school gets out. Oh man, the possibilities are endless. I haven't had a friend that I could just hang out with all the time like I used to.  Last, but not least. Is the altercation I was envolved in. Well, Seth and I were playing basketball and these stupid little kids, which I have had problems with before came up and were harassing him. They were claiming that he gave cigerettes to their little brother, who is only 9, and was with them. I defended him and asked the kids what the whole deal was. I mean, even IF he did, the kid took them. Well, one of the bitch sisters stole my basketball and ran home with it. Her twin sister, Calista, which I have mentioned before in my posts, told her to give it back. Calista likes me I guess, because she was on my side. Anyway, so now my basketball had been stolen. Well, Brent and Mike rode up on their bikes and we were telling them about all the shit that was going down. The four of us rode our bikes up to their house and demanded that they give my ball back. There mom made them get it while she proceded to threaten us. "Don't give my kids alchohol, drugs, or cigerettes or I'll blast you." Seth says "I didn't give them cigerettes. Then Brent tells her that her stupid kids were throwing rocks at his house. She tells us that they will be dealt with and goes inside. The bitch that stole my ball tosses it as us and Brent says Thanks. She says "Jackass" and goes inside. (lol) Mission Complete.
