      Today I went to practice in Gardner for 6 games with the intent on playing different lines and different ball speeds with all three of my bowling balls that I mainly use (V2 Particle for heavy oil, Eraser Pearl Particle for medium/heavy to medium, and a Barbed Wire for short oil conditions). I didn't care about the scores, I focused on hitting the lines I intended on hitting. I moved between throwing it off the edge on an angle from the 2 to 3 board, frozen rope to the pocket (could only do that with the Barbed Wire), to playing straight up first arrow, second arrow, third arrow, to swinging from fourth arrow and then one game swinging from second arrow to gutter and back. I found that the line I struggle with most is deep inside, I could not get the V2 Particle to consistently break where I wanted it to and left a number of 3-5-6 combinations. I also left a couple of 7-9's from that deep angle, I need to learn to follow through more while not overturning my wrist on this type of shot.  I will spend more time this summer working on different aspects of my game. I think my ball speed needs to decrease on a consistent basis, especially my strike shot. I think I will work on that in the next couple of weeks.  Matt

      Thank you for reading my first bowling blog entry. My name is Matt and I'm 33 years old- I've been a bowler for 29 plus years. Currently I'm bowling in a summer league in Gardner, MA with my daughter who's 10 (it's her first league) and my father in law on Tuesday nights. It's a non-sanctioned league that I wanted to get into to introduce my daughter to the sport of bowling (she's never bowled before in her life).   This is our second week in the league and it's been a while since I've bowled on a shot that would be best described as a typical house shot (THS). The first 8 boards on each side of the lane have significantly less oil than from board 9 to 9...some would describe this condition as a top hat as well. My normal comfort line as a lefty is to swing from 10 to 6, but on this shot I've learned to play 8 to 4 and back. I typically average 17 mph with my ball speed, and I don't really crank the ball too much. I keep things simple and to the point.  My scores were 221 with a 3-6-7 open in the 10th of that game, a 161 second game with a couple of missed 7 pins, a diamond chop in the 7th and a 3-9 chop in the 10th, and a clean 233 last game for a 615 series. My average after two weeks is a 218, and both weeks I was able to use my Eraser Pearl Particle (15 lbs) for strikes and spares. They throw down enough oil in the middle that I can straighten out my strike ball and pick up most of my spares. I need to work on better focus with my second game, my parents and best friend came to visit me during this game and I lost all concentration on what I should have been doing for a target and ball speed.   My daughter shot 306 for a series and my father in law shot 388, we won all 4 points. I noticed that only 3 honor scores had been shot on lanes 1-2 in all the years the house has been open (at least 40 to my knowledge). So I guess I should feel happy with my 615 series. I hope next week to throw three consistent games and eliminate opens-I'm missing too many easy spares each night.

      After the good practice session I had on Saturday I had a feeling that this Tuesday's league could be a special set. I did some stretching of my legs and arms before bowling and had a good line in practice playing 8 to 3 or 4 and back at about 15.5 mph with my Eraser Pearl Particle. We were bowling on lanes 7-8 against no one, so I knew that we would have to pace ourselves. Out of the gate I started with 2 strikes, then left a ringing 7 pin which I picked up. I finished with the next 9 strikes for a 279 game (my high of the season). Next game I made a 2 and 1 move (2 boards with my feet right, 1 board with my target right) and had to fight the beginning of lane carrydown. I mixed strikes with 1 7 pin leave and 4 10 pin leaves for a 208 game. No opens once again. The last game I started playing a tighter line from 12 or 13 out to 8 and began striking again- leaving the occasional 6-9 or 3-6-9 if I got my ball speed up to high. The last game was a 245 so I had a 732 series for the night with no opens and no splits.   I'm starting to feel really good about where my game is at this point. I have acquired a Hot Wire as well to add to my arsenal,  I need to get it plugged and redrilled. My daughter also had a good night of bowling with a 318 series and my father in law also bowled well with a 404. So far we are 11-1 and either in first or second place.   My father will bowl with us next week as my father in law has to go in for eye surgery to hopefully repair his sight in his right eye. It's amazing how well he bowls as he tells me he can't see anything but the head pin with his vision right now. Proves to me that bowling is like riding a bike- once you've done it a few times, you never forget.  Matt
