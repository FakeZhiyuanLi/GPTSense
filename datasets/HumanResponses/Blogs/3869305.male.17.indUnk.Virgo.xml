      okay looks like my insomnia has over... i could sleep fairly well last nite... isnt it a hurray!?!?! LOL    btw, we had "that" fuckin econ test.. i dunno wat to write.. i just poured everythin that i read the other nite, kept writin, writin, writin, till my hands were numb....    okay, we need a good, happy news today.. and yes Lord i have it...  I GOT MY NEW MOBILE TODAY, ITS A PDA A925 ... well, im pretty happy with the deal and my new mobile of course... spent around 1/2 hour to figure out how to lock this ting... i just realized that i needed to read the manual....    the book "The Da Vinci's Code" is getting interesting and more interesting in every page i turn to... i really recommend tis book, although some of my friends say that the ending is a lousy one.... i havent reached the last part of the book, so who cares?    weekend is getting nearer and despite of having a pleasant, happy saturday, maybe i'll just stay at home becoz of the upcoming rain....

      another update! this is part of my new resolution to cure my insomia prone (what de hell!!)    today was fairly alright...  JUST THE FACT THAT IT WAS FREEZIN LIKE AN IGLOO HOUSE AT THE HIGHEST PEAK OF EVEREST, IT WAS 0.4 DEGREE THIS MORNING ... i couldnt sleep (like usual) and thought about went up and turned up the lappie, just to find out that it was too cold outside my warm blanket... at last i just laid down in the bed, waitin til i slept around 5 am....    anyway, we received a bad news from indo today.... one of hudi's friend died in a terrible car crash... i dont know his friend actually, but it gives me a creep that someone might die just anytime, anywhere...    enough for the big news.... today i met daniel in library... apparently, he wanted to hire a limousine for prompt nite (next week)... the problem is that there much likely not enough ppl to fill in the limo...  ONLY FIVE PPL PLANNING TO GO, DO I EXPECT MYSELF PAYIN THE LIMO FOR FIVE PPL??? ... so the plan was stalled till this point...    other news... i went to english tutorial today, expecting the teacher gave me a good comment on it...  CONVERSELY, I WAS SUFFERING, SHIVERING, WRITING TILL MY FINGERS ARE NUMB, I WROTE ALL THE WROTE ESSAY (AGAIN FOR THE FOURTH) IN FACT ... she said it wasnt good enough though :D    another day passed, i am waiting for another insomniac night....

      Yesterday was a loooonngg day.... firstly, i couldnt slept again (yea yea, tis is not new for ya), i slept around 3 and woke up by mari's alarm (bom sounds : pippipipipipipipippp) gee...  I WAS SCARED TO DEATH, PREPARED TO JUMP ACCROSS DA ROOM EN HIDE UNDER THE TABLE .... luckily del shouted outside:  "Put the alarm off, wil ya!!"  and suddenly it was cool and calm again....    in the afternoon, i, hudi, kentung, rikson. suhit and yohanes went down to city for lunch. It was great inside rikson's car..  ONLY IT WAS STOOPID TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON .. well we made it to city at last (after few tricks on the road and i was on almost-vomit stage)    then we had dim sum... i couldnt recall when the last time i ate dim sum that lot..  WE, STARVED AND EXHAUSTED OF TRAFFIC, ATE 15 TYPES OF DISHES ... surprisingly, it was considerably cheap, so it was alrite actually.. (only the squid troubled me with stomachache long after the lunch time, i ate two plates btw)    continue.... we went to 3's office becoz hudi wanted to change his plan phone.. we searched the city, couldnt find out where was the office... until we passed a group of ppl with black shirts, walking down the street, mentioned sumtin about the company... hudi ran down to em and found out that they were the 3's employees... we went to the office then,  WE WERE IN THE STAGE OF SHOCKED, THAT THE OFFICE WAS ORIGINALLY AN APARTMENT, NOT AN OFFICE WITH GLASSES, WOODEN TABLES AND PRETTY CHICKS ON THE RECEPTIONIST TABLES ... anyway, the deal was done pretty quick (the employees were from indonesia) and hudi got his new phone... (rite now im thinkin to follow hudi, but i want the other phone, the PDA one)    lastly, i borrowed Shrek 2 from hudi, just to find out that the dvd didnt work on my laptop....

      i'm still alive and kickin' ppl!!!! mwahahahaha... at last i updated this blog...    well, today was the second school day and i was enjoying it by heaps of homework and anxiety feeling of upcoming trial exam :D    it was chilly and stormy this morning, and this weather were unlikely to continue til weekend. this is bad, as im thinking to go to harbour town this weekend with the boys :(    i finished my english presentation today, it wasnt the best but i tried my best. as usual, the usual people did their jobs really well in the presentation    after dinner, i learned something new. alan told me the art of a salesman. he used to be a salesman and he told me his experiences. what interested me most was that actually salesman used psychology knowledge and body languange to encourage ppl to buy their products. alan told me several tricks and techniques that a salesman may used to a customer, and really i learned a good deal of the use of body languange and psychology. it was very interesting topic and i hoped to put it in practise....    now, i gotta go to my bed. many sleepless nite i had during these days. i suffered insomnia (this is not a new thing for me btw) and of course the holiday syndrome is still around my head. so i'll try to sleep, well as much as i can. last but not least, i hope i could update this blog more often from now on....

      today is friday night and i'm watching MTV movie awards 2004 with a basket of chips. i got nothing to do today, well, actually sunny asked me to go to garden city but i refused it. so once again, its couch potato rules in da house! :))    when i watched the mtv movie awards, i listened into 1 very nice song. i never heard of a band called "Yeah Yeah Yeah" before but trust me, their song "Maps" was great and superbly performanced. go people download it!!! (but when u ppl know where to find it, contact me first ok?)

      Hemm, today i went to AQWA, a kind of Seaworld place, but instead this place only had Australian's marine creature.  Its a looong way to go there, trust me. I spent 2 hours on the bus and 10 minutes walking just to be asked to pay 16 bucks for the entrance....  The place itself somehow disappointing, so i dont recommend anyone to got there. Believe me, you better spend your money in Pot Black :)))  Well, there was a funny accidents though. There we found 4 gorgeous, super cars parked in the middle of the road. There were BMW Z4, Mini Coopers, MG and.. i couldnt remember the last 1 :) Anyway, these cars were great and we would like to take some pictures while we found out that there were "For Hire" banners covered the car windows. OMFG, these cars were for hire! Anyway, we only managed to take the pictures from the back of the cars.....

      We had a party tonight. Alan's sister came from NSW with her three daughters... Well, you can see that our topic is the NSW chicks :)) One of them is pretty hot and she can speak Indonesian !!! :))) Too bad we only talked for about 1/2 hour becoz after that we watched movie "Torgue"  The movie itself was pretty cool, really it looked like The Fast and The Furious, with the motorbikes instead of the powerhouse cars  The dinner was also great, we had BBQ party, so sausages, steaks and beers were everywhere along with the chicks played pool and the boys joked and shared their stories  After the party, I felt tired and ready to sleep. But, I got a new novel and a new game to play around with :)))
