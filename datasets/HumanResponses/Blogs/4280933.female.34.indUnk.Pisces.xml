						   These fine words of wisdom came from my husband's lips last evening. He is growing up slowly, but every once in awhile he has a jump forward in the process. These past two days have been his latest leap. He tries so hard...he really does. Friday night he said to me, "you see it sometimes in people who have severe drug addiction or alcoholism. They fail to mature socially and psychologically. I never finished growing up and I need to do it now. It is going slowly." What bravery to turn that cynical and jaded eye inward. I respect him so much for that.  My job is to help support him emotionally and be never-failing in my expression of my love for him, so that he knows he is a worthy human-being.  Well now, about the sleeves. OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE I FINISHED THEM!! They are a tad snug, but I think that is due to all the excess fabric from the chemise sleeve I pinned inside. Looking at the portraits makes me think I need to line the inside of the blue parts with a beautiful small-print brocade, or with more of the red. Then I can do away with the poofy-poofs and have a smooth line with a better fit. And that is a super easy addition to do.  Last night the husband and I came up with what we think is a great idea. He wants to play, but has trouble maintaining an accent and a character, because when he talks, he drops right out. I suggested that if his character didn't speak English, he could keep his silence and whisper into the ear of an interpreter (me). I thought he did a bored, haughty look well, so I thought a high-born noble character would be good. I came up with an actual historical person: John III of Sweden. His mother was Margareta Leijonhufvud, father, Gustav I of Sweden. He is half brother to Eric XIV of Sweden, who will reign until 1568, so currently John, or Johan, is the ruler of Finland, called the Duke of Finland. In 1562, in Vilnius, he marries Catherine of Poland -- Katarina Jagellonica -- who is the sister of Sigismund II of Poland and sister to panna Anna Jagellonica (Marti). My thought is that he could be traveling with the Margrave on his way to marry Marti's sister. Unfortunately, Craig is insistent that any new characters be Polish or Prussian, so we may just make him a Prussian Captain, who is seeking my hand.  I got a new sewing gig - making a repro of the Mary of Hungary dress. Gorgeous fabric, she ordered, and I am having her do blackwork in exchange for part of the sewing...she does amazing work, being in the SCA and all.  I wish I had 500 bucks to spare.  I want to order trim!!!  No writing over the weekend; I may do some today if the housework doesn't break me. :)  Tomorrow is Hubby's birthday, and I have nothing for him. I suck. Guess I should start on his new doublet.

						   Oh, my God...this morning at 6:00 I realized that these sleeves need to be done by tomorrow, not the 28th!  I totally forgot about the dinner at Uncle's house. *eek!*  I went downstairs and did some major work on them. I cut out the backings for the upper part of the sleeve, and cropped, fray-checked, hemmed and stitched the lower parts, as well as binding the upper edge in burgundy duck. The upper sleeves are shirred and poofed a bit; they are like the murray/goose-turd dress, except I cut the shirred part deeper this time to have a bigger poofing effect.  I am beading the trim on the bottom of the upper sleeves--it is a succulent red and gold trim that I am actually using the reverse side of. The lower sleeves will be slashed and tied up the length of them, in three placesThis is going to be an awesome dress when I can get it together.  Well, there's always nap-time!   I guess I still need to make the camisa.  I am dying to use the fabric that Isla got online--the embroidered one--as it is SO FANTASTIC.  Lightweight linen with the all over design. *sigh* there are only 2 or 3 yards, so I will have to just make a short one with big sleeves.  As long as it can tuck into the corset, it should work ok.  The gold-wire dickie that I made to go with the murray dress is turning green on me.  UGH! I guess I have to retire it and find a different fabric that is super sheer...I am sure I have something, just not sure if it is the right color...RIT dye, here I come!  Oh, wait...I should ask Janet if she still has some of that gold organza left over from the wedding!  All I need is a couple of pieces that are about 15" x 10"...  Alas, the house is stirring and it is time for me to do the daily grind.

						   Well, I have been writing again.  It is a traditional storyline for a romance...but I am going way beyond romance and all the way to hard-core sex...YAY!!  This one is going to be hot...pirates, cutthroats, abduction, seduction, hidden identities revealed.  *sigh* Makes me all shivery just thinking about it.  I got the kitchen all cleaned up nice, have dinner already planned and halfway executed. Need to do online grocery shopping.  Have to make sleeves by SF.  But overshadowing it all is a burning desire to write this story.  To get it on paper so it can enflame others as well.  I need to make a list of synonyms and euphamisms for penis and vagina, so as to avoid using the same words over and over in the same paragraph.  Everyone should have such troubles!
