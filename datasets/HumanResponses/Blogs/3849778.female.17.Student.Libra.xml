      This post has the potential to be a bohemoth. Or not. I'm quite exhausted at this point in time.  But I didn't do anything.  Now, I will gladly explain what that statement has to do with anything. See, this morning, I headed off to the (semi)local beach. Don't get any grand ideas that I live in some fabulous warm sunny spot. No, this beach is on the shores of Lake Erie. That's one of the Great Lakes, for anyone who wondered, or didn't know. Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. I went with a church group. My church group. Sort of. That's a long and complicated story for a different post. This group is filled with friends of mine. I knew two of them would be there for sure, but there was potential for up to 6 of them - these are my closest friends. I knew everybody there, but mostly as acquaintances. Now, I am not an overtly social person, so acquaintances are not my most favorite people. The only people I really knew there were my best friend, whom we'll call Susie, and my friend's little sister, whom we'll call Becky.  Now, Susie has a story all her own, but for now we'll suffice it to say that the title of best friend is mostly a courtesy, remnant, etc... from a different time, especially on my part. Becky had friends who were going, so I was not expecting to talk to her much, but at least some. Besides us three, there were six others.  We spent a meager 3 hours at this beach. Granted beaches are tiring in general. But by the time we left the beach, I felt like I had run a marathon. Obviously I hadn't, having read and slept for half the time, and the other half spent talking. Is it normal to feel so exhausted after speaking to a close friend?? No, of course it isn't. It should make you happier. I often feel tired after a social outing.  I actually have no idea where I'm going with this, and in my half-asleep state, it doesn't really feel like I'm being cohesive, comprehensible. Oh well. It felt good to get it out. I'm going away now. I'll be back soon with details of things no one cares about but me.

      Ok, so I'm not Frankenstein... not even that weird looking replica they have on Conan is  really  Frankenstein...  That was a bit more of a waste than I was going for. Anyway... this post is to do what I was too tired to do last night. In filling out my profile, I wanted to expound on my thoughts concerning music, but was rejected due to a limit on words, and the bizarre need for a list, and a list only. So, now, to waste a minute of your time... I will write it here.  I have fairly eclectic music tastes. Note that I said  fairly . There are three genres I won't touch with a ten foot pole: Jazz, rap, and hip hop. Now, you have to understand, being a child of whatever generation they're calling us these days, disliking rap and hip hop does not lend itself to me being among the elite. But I digress. Rap is a talent I respect - rhythmically speaking rhyming words quickly? My grandma will understand computers before I could ever do that. But just because I respect it, doesn't mean I like it. Especially not what it has become - an extension of hip hop. Which is the lowest of the low. It is entirely synthesized, the lyrics are about vile, degrading subjects, and the artists (I use that term in the most generous sense of the word) couldn't actually sing if they were to be castrated. And not to mention the only way one can dance to it. I went to one school dance (a mistake I don't intend to replicate), and discovered that one can only look good at that particular activity if one has the appropriate coordination. Something I don't, and will never have. Jazz, while a fine form of music has never held my attention for more than three seconds.   Punk didn't make the list of music I don't listen to, but it should get honorable mention. The overly peppy, bouncy feel mixed with the always nasal, high and whiny voices of its lead singers lends itself to annoying me as well. But, there do tend to be rare gems in this genre, hidden at the bottom of the charts, being ignored in the rush for the popular. So, it doesn't make the list.  On to what I actually  do  enjoy. I prefer blues, alternative, hard rock, some metal, emo, and whatever genre Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, and Julie Roberts belong to. I suppose it's pop, but not in the 'Britany Spears' sense. I suppose she falls into my scorned category as well. As do all blonde (or used to be) teen singers, actors who try to sing, boy bands, and whatever it is that Beyonce sings. But I'm getting off my topic again. Johnny Cash is excellent, as is most classic rock. I enjoy Christian music, because despite the wrap it's gotten for being horrible, mushy, praise stuff (which is good), there are some very decent artists out there from any genre one could ask for. But, you do have to know where to look. Add to that a few goofy, ridiculous songs that make me giggle, songs from Moulin Rouge and the Phantom of the Opera, and that's about the sum of what I listen to.  Notice that I side-stepped the country issue in it's entirety. It is its own monster. I don't listen to country. In fact, I'm rather prejudiced against it. To me, it embodies everything I hate about the town in which I currently reside. However, there are a total of three or four songs that I can listen to. An Allison Krauss song, Concrete Angel by Martina McBride (maybe it's by her???), and Earl by the Dixie Chicks (one of the ridiculous songs mentioned above). Earl is the perfect example of why arguments that country music is wholesome are false. Two women (one of which wasn't smart enough to get out of nowhereville and married the local idiot) get away with murder, especially because they sell 'Tennessee Ham and Strawberry Jam' on Highway 109. It's so awesome in its ridiculousness.  Anyway. Favorite artists: Jonny Lang, (early only!)Metallica, Our Lady Peace, Demon Hunter, Mortal Treason, and Sarah McLachlan. Favorite songs of all time: Hurt by Johnny Cash, God Called In Sick Today by AFI, and Wonderwall by Oasis.  That was way more than a minute. And to wrap up, I'd like to say how awesome Conan O'Brien is. Conan O'Brien is awesome.

      This blog is to really vent, to put my true inner feelings out there, for random strangers to read them, comment on them, briefly wonder what strange hole I came out of, and then forget the whole thing happened. I have another blog elsewhere, but everyone knows about  that  one. I'm taking refuge in anonymity. And in my refuge... torture to all who come across it. Enjoy!
