      Last weekend was a memorable one for me!  I have been to the street at George V near Arc De Triomphe to buy a camera looking for a SONY showroom. It’s verisimilar to the Brigade Road in Bangalore but its very long and very wide with wide platforms.  When I reached here I was thinking that people here are too cold like the weather here. But the walk down that street made me re-think! People are screaming! But maybe that’s not real happiness, but at least you get a feel of how it would look like!  On both the sides of the street there are big automobile showrooms of every international carmakers!  Wherever you go you see the orderliness of the buildings and the meticulous plan of the city that makes transport so easy and trouble-free unlike our Indian roadways and railways which are quite confusing! You just have a map of Paris with the routes of RERs, Metros and SNCFs (various types of trains) and voila! you can go anywhere without troubling anybody. Cool!  Then at last in a showroom in La Defense I saw a camera that was good and I bought it.  The next day I’ve been to 'Musee de Louvre' and 'Tour Eiffel'.  Just to behold the building of the museum, which they say was used by Napoleon Bonaparte, is wonderful. It’s too huge.  The museum is divided into 4 main buildings with 2 stages. After spending some 6 hours inside, I could cover only half of it!  The sculptures and the paintings have a lasting influence, which makes them eternal. The Greek and Italian sculptures of the well-built kings and soldiers made me feel very puny! There is one feeling that runs and that connects all these pieces in the museum together. BEAUTY. Exquisite, exemplary beauty in all its splendours. No inhibitions whatsoever. The artists just seem to express themselves.  The sculptures and paintings make you think that artists love nudity for its revealing beauty of the human body. Felt proud of having one of those myself! Common people seem to abuse this!  When I saw those paintings, I really wondered how the society would have tortured those artists, those amazing gods of eternality, for they might not have been 'productive' by its standards! Surely many of them would have died of starvation for the world accepts a genius only after it slays him! Felt really strange! Every one of those paintings and sculptures tell you a story , even though the explanation given by the placards placed in front of them speaks French! I understand and cry as a salute to those gods!  There was a rush to see the Monalisa painting .For once, you feel that all ways in the museum lead to that painting! But when I saw that, I couldn’t quite understand what’s so great about it, thanks to my appalling ignorance of art! That too the lady looks as if she has not slept properly posing for the picture! In spite of my ignorance, I saw many other paintings that captured my attention and ate my memory card of the camera!  Next I've been to the Eiffel tower, just to have a look at it. Thought that it would not be so interesting and would be dull to behold. But as usual I was proved grossly wrong! What a massive structure and what imagination! Indeed people who love beauty seem not to think of logic, reasoning and purpose. But I think that even though it looks like that prima facie, its not so. Beauty is in itself a purpose! Create things which are beautiful and you have given them a meaning for them to exist!  When I get closer and closer to the tower, I slowly realized the size. I felt really fearful when I was at its foot. Beauty and mass mixes up to produce fear?! Quite strange! For every 10 minutes of an hour they switch on the lights, which randomly sparkle all over the tower and which simply cannot be captured by a still camera! Nor do I think that any kind of recording can capture the feeling. I stopped clicking and just stood at the foot and looked up and it’s a dream! Forget everything and look at it! You feel at once lost and above anything else!  People here seem to pay a lot of attention to beauty, love and experience.   THEY LIVE!  Merci.

      As if I command the sunrise and sunset, I planned to visit all over the 2nd and 3rd arrondissements of the city of paris! So I took the map which I had bought earlier and noted down the important landmarks in those areas.It read like this: 1.Notre Dame Church, 2.Beauborg district (a book said that it’s the most picturesque place in Paris), 3.Ile de la Cite, 4.Quartier Latin, 5.Top of the Eiffel Tower, 6.Ile Saint-Louis. This seems to be a short list!  When I reached Notre Dame Church it was already 1pm, since I woke up very late!  Notre Dame church is an architectural feat! And it has been carved in the early 14th century. When I was in there , I could not realize the historic importance of that building. If you do not know a bit of history of Paris and its monuments, its of almost no use visiting them except for their picturesque beauty! It has witnessed great historic moments like the crowning of King Napolean to the most recent one like the visit of King Narayan I !  I have always wondered why does a human being require an institution like religion and more strangely an institution like marriage! Its quite perplexing if I go looking for an answer! It seems to me a pre-historic question which should not be pondered upon in the post-modern 21st century where its taken for granted by majority that these institutions are indispensable part of a human life! Quite strange! But in spite of having not an answer for this question , I realize Notre Dame church epitomizes the importance given to a religion by the kings and the commons, verisimilar to the attention that the temples in south India had received.  Before getting into the church I circumambulated around the building to record its beauty. It has intricate carvings with a lot of detail. Outside the church there's a wonderful garden. Before again reaching the entrance to get into the church, I went into a small gift shop and bought some souvenirs which were quite cheap by money but pretty rich with meaning. I don’t buy things like this very often. I consider them junk .But this time they had some meaning to be transferred!  Then I went into the church. There was some prayer going on. The hall looked gloomy and tall with lot of arches on the roof. Nothing much to see inside. The carvings, a placard said were done in mid-14th century! It had those colourful stained-glass paintings. I got bored inside. Things like these look pretty outside, but internally they stink with rotten meaninglessness!  When I came out of the church it was 4pm and I had to buy vegetables and other cookeries at Gare Du Nord and had to visit the top of the eiffel tower. I had to ditch the idea of visiting all other places since that shopping will take a couple of hours and I should be there at the top before sunset to capture the view both at daylight and artificial lights. I went to the Eiffel tower. There was a huge rush and I thought it would take a couple of hours to even get the ticket and then ditched that idea too and went to Gare du Nord, bought some vegetables and returned to the room.  But amidst these I roamed around the Beauborg district , before going to Eiffel tower. As far as I have seen Paris and that place, its certainly not the most picturesque one! Bastille seems to be a very good place, with peaceful gardens, to live at.  When I was walking along these streets I saw an old woman who looked like some 40 years old. She was almost half-naked and with a lot of facial make-up. At the first sight I thought she was waiting for somebody, just like anybody else and my pace of walk was quite normal. Then within another furlong, I saw another woman in the same state. Another one...another one...Now I realised who they were!! Some were young too! I had a lot of money in my pocket. There's nobody in that part of the world who would recognize my identity. All alone in that atmosphere! I could do it if I want! Then a strange fear crept inside my mind. I cannot explain to myself why I felt like that. Freedom and fear, I thought are quite opposite. But here I experienced both these seemingly mutually exclusive emotions at once. That increased my pace of walk. I got out of that place as soon as I can! Even now I feel that pace!  There was another incident which affected me this day. When I was metro-ing towards Eiffel Tower I guess, there came a violinist-beggar inside the cabin where I was sitting. By now, I am used to these metro-beggars who play some music and ask for money and the kind of body-build and the faces and eyes they possess. Opposite to me there sat a man whose eyes cannot concentrate on a place for long. His hair was disheveled and his eyes rotund. He was holding a new tome in his hand. I could read from his face that he doesn’t have what it takes to read a book! He opened the book and started reading. Within a second he flipped through the pages and looked at me who was staring at him! He kept on flipping the book like that as if he lost his golden ring somewhere in between the pages! My guess was right! He cannot read a book.  In the meanwhile the violinist had been playing his tune. His eyes looked quite strange. There was no sign of begging. He was adroit with that instrument. But this is not unusual since he might have played the same piece of music a thousand times before. His face impressed me. He looked like a normal guy who might as well be working as a software engineer! I felt from his eyes that he could take up my job and he would do better than myself and definitely I cannot play that violin like that! He ended his play. Took out a ticket pocket that we have for having our photo and the monthly pass and used it to collect the coins that people gave him. The train stopped at the station where I had to get down. I took an euro and gave it to him! I still cant believe that I dropped an euro to a beggar. I had never dropped a coin to a beggar even in India! If you have read and digested Ayn Rand, a beggar cannot impress you. And if you are impressed by one, he cannot be a beggar! I was sure that he didn’t want money just to exist but to live. So I decided so. He too got down in the same station and I asked him to pose for a photo. He did and eagerly looked at the image I had captured in the camera. He said 'merci' and walked away without turning back. I took the map to read about the next train I had to take. I could not read it. My throat was choked with a heavy heart.I sat in the nearby bench and tears started oozing out of my eyes.I somehow controlled them so that they do not wet my sweater! It took me some time to get back to normal. There is something really wrong with either that fellow or the society in which he lives.  The day ended with these many things worth recording!  The next day I decided to take a walk along the banks of river seine. This river is seen as the reason for the birth of this historic city. I hoped that the sceneries would be good to  capture. Unusually, I was not dismayed. I started at the station of Gare de Lyon and from there started walking along the banks. Surely the panoramic views with the bridges, the Notre Dame church and the Eiffel Tower far away, is a sight that one should not miss. It was so beautiful. I could not believe in that heavenly beauty. What a fantastic scene! I tried my level best to capture them in my camera.  Along the banks of the river are the church and the Concierge building and Musee de Orsay museum and if we cut a little bit farther from the banks then and there we can see good monuments (of whose identity I am unaware) and pillars and statues. I came to the church and thought of getting inside again!  There are a lot of second-hand book sellers along this bank near the church who also sell paintings and covers of old magazines and posters of historic importance. There were a lot of books, but very few in English.  I saw a couple of pictures of Einstein with his quotes: "Imagination is more important than Knowledge" "If you have trouble with your Mathematics, do not worry. I have greater ones with mine!" Coincidentally, the day the 14th of March was Einstein's birthday. I thought he is right. A man can live a life without knowledge. Its no sin. But if he is living without imagination and artistic expression then he's no more a human being. I thought, "Knowledge is Present. Imagination is Future".  Just before the entrance I saw a man who was inviting people to be drawn as caricatures of themselves. I thought its a good idea to have a caricature of myself drawn. After a bit of argument that guy settled for 10 euros.Surprisingly, I said ,"Go Ahead"! I sat before him for some 10 minutes. He asked me to look at the side to get a good view of my facial features. I could see the picture he was drawing in his glasses! "Where are you from? London?", he asked! "India". "What are you doing? Student?" "Software Engineer". I felt a bit strange. When I look myself in the mirror I cannot believe that I am a software engineer. The notion of a student is, I think, better suits me and well deserved, because I have a lot to learn. He finished it and it was not what I wanted. I said thanks to him. Took a picture of him. While walking back to home , I tore away the picture and deleted his photo from my camera, since I didn’t like the thing! I cursed myself for wasting 10 euros just like that. I thought I would like a portrait of myself rather than a caricature which follows the whim of the artist.  While taking a walk inside the church, looking for anything that I had missed the last day. The same boring religious drawings and paintings! But still the church from outside is worth looking at!  After walking along the banks for a few hours, I returned to my room to re-fuel myself. Then I went to the Eiffel Tower to go to the top of it. I thought there would be  a mad rush since its Sunday and I was there around 5pm so that I could watch Paris from the top of it. To my surprise there were few people. In another half-an-hour I went to the top. I am an acrophobic and I was alone! I thought that anyway even children are there and there would be enough safety measures. There were and I didn’t feel any fear at the top. I discovered that my fear is not the height itself, but in climbing the height. Since it was inside a lift with lot of people , I didn’t feel the fear. But I could not take the stairs due to that fear!  At the top of the Eiffel tower, the view although not as beautiful as anything as looked at from the ground, it was a good one. Nothing special about Paris. I thought if Bangalore had an Eiffel Tower then it might look as good too! The only thing worth capturing from that height is the flow of the river Seine. I waited for skyline to get dark. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day and I could not see the sunset properly. It was really chill and very windy at the top. But I was there for around 3 hours just to see Paris, the city of lights, lit. It drizzled a little too!  After it got dark completely, and when the whole city was lit, it was a good sight to behold. But its very difficult to capture those details in a camera. But I tried. And in that chill breeze, even though I was wearing woolen gloves, my fingers were trembling and the pictures I was taking, shaking! I would go to a calm place there, warm myself, take a picture and then go back!  I cannot forget the couples who kept on kissing each other standing at the zenith of the tower. I wondered why do they come to the top of the tower and try this stunt in this unbearable weather. They could very well do that in the warmth of their bedrooms with much more savour! I am kind of getting really annoyed of these French kisses. Indeed, couples who travel in metros do not waste their time. They keep kissing , happily ignoring the public. I kind of like that care-free attitude. To watch a beautiful couple kiss each other at such close quarters, as inside a lift, within a feet away from you, is a sight to be savoured every second! A note of a trip to Paris is not complete if it doesn’t talk about the French kisses, I guess! So now I have done that!  After taking enough of pictures, I came down.  So this weekend ended this way!  I think slowly the Paris-fever is running down!

      The weekdays rolled on too fast to me that at the end of it I realized that the weekend was not planned properly. I just thought I would visit the 'village' Paris.  This week was a bit boring.  The theme of 'village' Paris included the area stretching from Montmatre to Batignolles and the museums Musee de la vie Romantique and Musee de la Eroticisme.  I was wondering what would be a 'funiculaire' train. At the foot of the Butte Montmartre, there's this train which could take us to the top of it where the church of Sacre-Couer sat. Its a kind of a coach on rollers on an inclined plane. I took the stairs anyway, not wanting to part with my euros. The church was beautiful. The weather was very cloudy. From the top of the hill, I had a good panoramic view of a part of Paris equivalent to what I saw from the second stage of Tour Eiffel. Lots and lots of tourists. Most of them were speaking English. Maybe one of the reasons why the guy who drew a caricature of mine asked if I am from London!  I went inside the church just to see if there's anything worth seeing! To my dismay, nothing. All of the glory of any monument here, seems to be interwoven with its history. Without that its just another good piece of a building. After the prayer was over, it was good to see people shaking hands with whoever sat around them for the prayer. I was surprised to see a placard in Tamil asking the devotees for donation towards the water and electricity of the church. Thought that there are many Tamilians around there to visit the church. Maybe SriLankans, as there are plenty of them in Gare Du Nord. There were a couple of street-musicians as usual there too.  Beside the church, there’s 'Place du Tertre' where were a gathering of artists who drew everything from caricatures to portraits to landscapes. Different types of them too. Indeed to watch them paint and to see their finished work was really fantastic and awe-inspiring. One artist told me that he needed 50 euros to draw a portrait of mine. I withdrew. But the prices vary greatly depending on the type you need. For  sometime I thought of getting a portrait of mine  done. But I thought its too costly.  To go to the museums, the map said that I had to get down the hill and walk a bit further.  When I got down the hill where the narrow street led to a wide road across, a big building stared at me with its huge neon sign reading 'sexodrome'! I was taken aback a bit. An English lady screamed to her husband, "how the hell did we reach  this hell of a place? the sex place!!". Both sides of the road were full of sex shops hosting live shows, peep shows.... Quite a strange sight for me who has only seen streets dedicated to jewellery, garments and the like!  I realized that I am in Pigalle.  The street was demarcated by the two metro stations Pigalle and Blanche.  Took a slow walk along the walkway to see the shops. The pictures that were displayed outside the shops, glaring at the passersby were quite obscene- the kind of pictures that are banned even in cyber cafes in India! Pornography is quite public here!  I thought that people who live here, can come to this place, perform the sin, go up the hill to the church and confess it and go back home purified! Quite a smart way to live indeed!  Along the road was the Musee de la Eroticisme! It was a small building. I entered it and saw that the entree[sic] fee was 7 euros. I looked around. The room was full of lewd statues and porno. Surely, I don’t want to spend my money here!  Then while walking down the street, a woman who was wooing the pedestrians into a shop, came running and said "Excuse me, Sir" and began to pour out words in French. I didn’t turn back to her fearing that that might be taken as a sign of approval! I almost started running! Its quite a disgusting place.  I thought that I should not buy sex. Instead I should earn it. If I earn it, then it means that it comes with love and it'll take me to heaven. If I buy it, it'll become an indelible thorn of steel in my heart and given the kind of character I am, it would surely kill me! Its so fatal. So I'll better remain away from this. But the problem is, I always think that I am not smart enough to 'earn' it. There's a great probability that I'll be a failure in this regard. Its very rare to come across people who earn their sex. The majority satisfy their appetite either by buying it or begging for it or settling for something cheap. I do not want to do anything of these.  And when I think of Love, I realize that its so elusive that those who seek it will not find it. The choice is not ours but Her's!  The 'Moulin Rouge' which was glorified by the eponymous Hollywood flick, starring Nicole Kidman, is in this street. I went to the street again the next day night to take a picture of that windmill placed on that mall, lit. While taking the picture and returning back too, I was accosted by a man who showed a shining card and pointed to a narrow street nearby and said "there are beautiful girls there, sir?". Instead of running away, this time I paused and  said, "No.Thanks"! After all, he too is a human being and in a sense, we both are beggars! The boredom which I go through is making me one!  Getting quite repugnant of the place and thinking of seeing those artists again at the top, I went to Place du Tertre and then to the church. There I sat at the steps. I was sweating due to the uphill climb and I took off the jacket and felt the chill air on my warm wet skin.  At this moment, I couldn’t quite grasp why, I felt really completely lonely. The old feeling of boredom which used to kill me while I was in Bangalore got its grip again on me! I felt tired and bored of the whole thing! Paris has failed to remove this sense of boredom from me. Then I started pondering about my favourite, unanswerable, ever-mysterious question of my career. Till now, I could not find what would enthuse me.  It seems that my mind is altogether inconsonant with whatever I experience, be it anywhere, anytime! I desperately want to find something which resonates with my mind. Or else its better to die, than going through this boredom and loneliness and the feeling of worthlessness. I am sure that with this sense of detachment to anything I cannot achieve anything in my life and am already a failure. But somehow this fact doesn’t seem to bother me. I always think that its perfectly fine to be a failure. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why I cannot find what I really want out of my life. Everything still looks meaningless, even though they are beautiful!   After resting outside the church, I got up with no specific place in my mind and roamed around the streets of Montmartre, which they say had inspired even some of the great thinkers who frequented the place. Quite a good place. Calm and serene. The narrow streets, typical of a village, without any tourist noise are good to be in.  Later in the evening I went to the village of Belleville just to see what’s there. But when I got out of the metro station onto the roads, the first impression of that place and the smell of it wasn’t good. To forget that hangover, I went to the 'timeless' Paris again, where I've been last week, to take a picture of Pont Neuf across river Seine lit in the night. As I expected, that place had a magic touch! I felt good again. Took some pictures and returned to my room.  Since I was bored this day I thought going of nowhere the morrow and went to sleep!  While returning to my room, in the metro, I saw a person who can neither be called a boy nor a man. Somewhere in between, like me. I liked his countenance. Lots of hair, clean cut of his nose and a 2-day old beard. He was reading a book and when I saw it I envied him! It was Victor Hugo's Les Contemplations. I felt like learning French to read Victor Hugo, Voltaire , Rene Descartes and the like - the kind of men who are keeping me alive and who make me realize that there’s nothing to get bored and there’s a universe to learn and contemplate upon. Its a  never-ending quest! I only wish to ask them, "THEN WHAT?"!  I couldn’t sleep beyond broad daylight at 7:30AM.And again got bored of the room! So I went to Musee de la vie Romantique and Jardin du Luxembourg.   The museum, unlike what the name suggests, was not at all romantic! In fact I found boring portraits of the Rouart family of artists and a not at all beautiful woman artist called George Sand and the materials they used and even their hair sample! I wrote in the visitor's book "Nothing romantic about this!". Got really pissed off.  At times, while strolling around this paradise, I feel a bit of wonder to think that I am at the opposite side of the world , so far from India, wearing the same jeans and T-shirt which I wore in Bangalore. And I feel a bit of sadness when I realise that I had to return! Dreams only last until you realize that they are dreams! Now the dream has ceased to be.  I expected the garden of Luxembourg to be huge and beautiful. But it was pretty small, even though beautiful. Spent some time there and then went to Gare du Nord as usual to buy cookeries with my roommates Amarnath and Srinand and returned to the room.

      Last weekend turned out to be another memorable weekend for me.  I thought that I have exhausted Paris and there's nothing more to see in it. I am grateful for Marc, who explained about the places to see in Paris and made me realize that I had barely seen Paris and there's a lot to be discovered and who guided to me to a bookstore in La Defense where I bought a guide. I had to start my sight-seeing almost from the scratch to be comprehensive.  So this week my plan was to cover: 1.Ile de la Cite 2.The Marais 3.Beauborg and Les Halles 4.Tuileries Quarter. But I couldn’t go to the last one for want of time.  It seems that every week I had to start with a church! So now it was St.Chapelle. The church, even though not as huge as Notre Dame, was quite impressive in its architecture. It had two chapels on 2 stages. The lower one was meant for the commons and the upper one seems to have been used by the kings. The lower chapel wasn’t quite attractive except for its roof which had many arches and was in a bright blue colour. A narrow circular staircase led to the upper chapel. Wow! It was so colourful and full of stained-glass paintings. But the tourists who were quite large in number made a hell lot of noise and the building reverberated it to my annoyance! I tried to take a good picture of the rose-window which depicts the scenes from old and new testaments. But my camera's zoom wasn’t good enough. One of the faces of the apostles there attracted me a lot with the calm in its face, carved so beautifully! You have to believe in something or the other to attain that calm or else you'll be pushed into eternal chaos and void. I would like to have a hairstyle and beard like that. If not for the damn tourists' noise I would have sat there for much more time. Felt that the environment was very good to sit and contemplate on something.  The marche aux fleurs et oiseaux (market of flowers and birds) was quite a treat for the eyes. It seems that the island was once famous for its flower markets and this is one of the very few left! There was a shop beside this for decorative items. The items were so beautiful that I wanted to build a house just to host them there!  Then I went through Rue de Arcole  which was full of souvenir shops to reach Notre Dame church. There were a few places there which I had missed earlier. Those are the point zero mark - from where all the distances within France are measured and crypte archeologique underneath which there are relics which are almost 2000 years old.I was looking for the statues of Gargoyles (chimeras) when I had been there before and found them now atop the walls of Notre Dame. Again my camera zoom was not powerful enough to capture them in close-up.  The woman who was in charge of the public toilet of Notre Dame church affected me a bit. She had quite a pleasant smile on her face always and she looked like an Indian. She was guiding the people to a free-cabin in the toilet. I thought nobody could have a passion for such a job and still she manages a smile.  Every street in Paris has a historic lusture. I was amazed to see a street sign on Rue de Francois-Bourgeois which pointed to 3 museums in 3 directions. Thought that one day or the other the residents of Paris will be evacuated for want of place for hosting the museums. So many of them.  I cannot forget Musee Picasso for the rest of my life for the impact it had had on me. I was quite half-hearted when I paid and entered the museum. But slowly I began to realize the genius of Picasso. It was so intense that it could pierce my ignorance of art. Mind-blowing imagination. Until then, my perspective of art and painting was that its just drawing portraits and landscapes and caricatures and theres no intelligence or analytical thinking involved in it. But many of the paintings that I could comprehend made me realize that I was egregious to an abysmal  extent. At first many of the paintings are quite inscrutable. I read the placards placed in front of each of the rooms explaining the importance of the exhibits and the phase of life of Picasso in which he drew them. Combined with a bit of imagination and absurdity, slowly I could decipher a few of them and those had a profound impact on me. What if I could understand everything? I would go mad! I used to think that only symmetry in objects and paintings would be beautiful. For once and forever I realized total incongruity can also be beautiful insofar as they depict the concept handled by the artist and the depth of it. I could see that at the start as an artist he too was drawing normal pictures and as he aged he paintings involved more and more abstraction. And also the subjects of the paintings like bull-fight, war, romance, sex, illness, death et al reflect the agony of their creator. And it was quite interesting to know that his wife ran away from him. Not surprising. They say that theres a woman behind every man's success. They forgot to add that he has to overcome that woman too to attain that success! They turn the simple task of life to an herculean one!  I was very much affected by a bronze piece of skull sculpted by him which reminded me of my mother's skull. Its still fresh in my memory and would be there till my head turns to one. The works which depicted illness, death, gruel war with dark and dull colours and which depict the frailty and ephemerality of life invoked sadness in me. Death is a subject which I am grappling with for quite sometime now and its unfathomable and quite disquieting! I believe that instead of trying to understand life by attacking it directly, I might get some light if I approach it by trying to comprehend its absence, death. They are two sides of the same coin. One inevitably leads to the other!  After going through most of his works and a bit of his biography I was wondering how could this world understand his complex conceptual works and allow him to rise to prominence. He is a genius inasmuch as he found a language to express his emotions. I was very much amused to see a group of little girls debating which leg belonged to which face in a painting and an elderly girl trying to guide them and make them realize the picture. I am ashamed of my ignorance of art.  Another part of the museum had his sculptures. They were works of a creative genius in Picasso. I've read about the bull-head created with a bicycle-seat and handlebar. To see that and to see many others like a goat's stomach made of a waste basket and a child in a trolley made out of iron pipes and pots was quite intriguing. It takes a genius to bring simplicity in chaos. This is exactly my state of mind - utter chaos and I am afraid I do not have the intelligence to discern the simple and eternal concepts behind them which runs this universe.  One more reason why I was annoyed with myself is my ignorance of the meaning of colours. If only I had that knowledge, I could fathom much more of Picasso. My heart and mind was full with pleasure when I came out of the museum for the only reason that I had discovered another language of expression. Quite a treat!   Then I went to the garden in Places des Vosges. Its beautiful with the surrounding buildings. There were lots of children playing there. And there were a group of violinists playing at a corner. There was a rush to hear to them. I envied those children very much. There's so much of art, music, poetry around and surely many of them would grow up as artists, poets, philosophers and musicians. No seed in a child would die of starvation of imagination and expression. Its a very appealing ambience.  In 6,Places des Vosges is Maison de (house of) Victor Hugo. There were a lot of paintings of his and the manuscripts and old posters of his shows were on exhibit inside. I didn’t know that he could paint. Everybody seems to have some knowledge of art and music. Its very bad that I didn’t study them. But many of the paintings depicted poverty and illness and other somber subjects. I didn’t quite like them. I would have appreciated if he had depicted glory and heroism. I equate him to those qualities. But it felt good to visit that house where its said that he wrote most part of Les Miserables.  The whole of the next day I spent in the beauborg district with most of the time in Musee National d'Art Moderne in the Pompidou centre. I started my tour at the Pompidou centre. Its strikingly different than any other building I would ever see. In short its a building built inside out. All kinds of pipes, elevators, escalators are outside the building! The pipes outside the building were coloured distinctively to symbolize their function like ventilation, water, air-conditioning, electricity etc. The escalator which takes us to all the floors was set up across the facade of the building which was quite an attraction. At first, I was not interested in the modern art museum. But I could go to the top of the building only if I take a ticket to the museum! So I dropped the idea of going there to the top to take pictures. The centre hosts a cinema complex - playing kind of art pictures. And from 19March to 17April its Bollywood special! They were playing chaiyya chaiyya song in a TV and then I heard the Hindi version of a song from the Tamil film Kandukondein Kandukondein! In the library there dedicated to art and industrial design I was amazed to see a book on Indian films with Simran on its cover. And there was a book on photography which was dedicated to human genitals! Really crazy!  Beauborg district is very small but its very beautiful. Last time I've been to the wrong part of it and thats why I felt that it wasnt the most picturesque. Place Igor Stravinsky, very near to the pompidou centre, has a lot of so-called modern fountains which were quite funny to look at. They seemed not to have been maintained well. Many werent working properly. But the place looked colourful.  Besides this place, there's St.Merry church. I went inside to see the old 13th century pulpit. The church was quite small. Many churches here have the look of Notre Dame.  Then I went to Fountain des Innocents and Forum les Halles. Forum les Halles is quite intriguing in that it has a garden at the ground floor and a big shopping complex, cinema complex , swimming pool, gymnasium in the floors below the garden! The building which surrounded the garden was pretty to look at.  After going to all these places, I entered into the Pompidou centre again.Got the ticket for the museum and went to the top!But I was dismayed to see that I could not get out of the closed glass escalators to the terrace or anywhere to take clear pictures.I could only take pictures from inside that glass tube!Then I went to the modern art museum!It turned out to be another lesson for me, like Musee Picasso.  Many paintings were quite indiscernible. The paintings were like scribblings of a kindergarten kid hung in the name of contemporary art! It was quite funny. But I was bemused very much with the works of artists called Cesar, Sigmar Polke(for Pasadena), Andy Warhol (for Electric Chair), Jean Pierre Raynaud(for Container Zero), Opalka (for Details).I could not quite understand container zero and pasadena. I noted all these names and works for investigating a bit on them! I myself felt strange. Many works which involved optical illusion and compression mechanics were also intriguing. Roman Opalka's details is a bit weird. The painting is nothing but a series of numbers. But the importance of it comes from the meaning given to it. Opalka seems to have wanted to do something that would only die with him and uptill then keep on evolving! So he decided to write numbers on a board. He started from 1 and I do not know where he ended. Only part of his work was on display. I could see numbers like 3309916, 5131330 and so on. When he finished one board of numbers he would take a photograph of himself. I think the total work includes a dozen boards. The colour of the board gets lighter and lighter starting from gray. The numbers are in white. So as he gets older, it becomes more and more difficult to read the numbers. What a crazy idea! I was wondering how much he should have been affected by death and the finiteness of life to make him take up this kind of a work.  Another artist that I should mention is Yaacov Agam. His is a fantastic idea. He hated the static nature of art and succeeded in bringing dynamism in it by involving time and motion. They call it kinetic art. A room was dedicated to one of his works. In a room, 3 sides , the floor and the ceiling contain some strange patterns. One side is ofcourse open for us to see! For once I was lost. I thought this is another one that I could not understand even a bit. But the silver ball placed at the centre of the room explained everything and the genius of Yaacov. I saw patterns of circles and diamonds and various other shapes. As you walk from one end of the face of the room to another you see the pattern changing! What a genius! What kind of painstaking imagination! Superb! That was indeed my favourite.  But my body got tired and hungry and I had to leave the centre to my room!  So this week turned out to be a week that awakened me towards art.Picasso and Yaacov Agam have lit the light!  There are abundant languages to express oneself. And I think the best and perfect among them is SILENCE.

      This weekend I didnt spend much time outside and from the few places I went, the predominant theme seemed to be, my pet pondering, Death.   I started at Place de la Concorde.Its a majestic square.Only one side of it has a building and all the other sides are open.There were two fountains in the middle with 8 statues each symbolising the french cities.The star attaraction of the square is the 3200 year old (!!!) Luxor Obelisk.With the Eiffel tower not far behind, it adds to the scenic seduction, I should say.  Very near is Jardin des Tuileries.A beautiful garden.Its better than the one in Luxembourg quarter.Here I was accosted by a boy who had a similar build like mine but far younger than me. "Excuse me,Sir.Do you know English?".  I thought he's going to ask me the way to somewhere for which I had a prepared answer, "Sorry.I am a foreigner!". But he asked me to read a card,which read,"I am staying with my mother and brother here.We are from...(I forgot!).My father died in Bosnia.We are starving.Please give me some money". These were not the exact words,but the meaning is intact. I read and looked at his face. "Sorry!" and smiled.I still do not know why I smiled then! These kind of acquaintances, although very short, kindles my mind very much and makes me ask seemingly silly questions for which I have no answers and I had to decide that I went by instinct rather than reason, which is very sub-standard for a rational being. After enjoying the garden, I proceeded to Palais Royal and the surrounding garden. Nothing very attractive.  To go to the palace, I had to go through Rue de Rivoli. At the middle of it is the statue of Joan of Arc. It reminded me of the movie with Milla Jovovich as the protaganist. I liked her figure and the way she portrayed the character. Fantastic. Rue de Rivoli is magnificent and imperial. You suddenly forget that you are in a very modern city and feel like being in a period where an emperor rules the country. This is not the only place where I get that feeling, since Paris is painstakingly maintaining her countenance. They don’t allow buildings to soar so that all the monuments and other historically precious places are prominent in the skyline. That’s why when I look Paris from the top of any tower or a monument, I get a feel of being in 18th century with all its kingly glory. The road has a lot of shops and I went into a few of them, just to see what’s in there and how the shopkeeper looks like!  The second part of my day was spent in the Latin quarter. I think they are the prettiest streets of Paris in the evening with lots of boutiques and restaurants. It was very busy.  Then I landed in the place of the day, the Pantheon. The facade looks like the pantheon of greece. I pitied the poverty of the imagination of its architect. But its supposed to be an architectural feat. All I could reason for that feat is its difficult to place 2 huge domes on top of one another with lot of room in between and support them with only 4 pillars which form the end-points of the 4 aisles, with the plan of the building looking like a cross with a circle at the intersection of the cross. They call this kind of mix of Greek and Gothic architecture as neo-classical style! It means that its neither new nor classic. Its a confusion. But the facade with this greek Pantheon-like pillars and the peristyle of the lower dome , looked royal.  The space inside is vast.The place is the necropolis of the great french personlities. The names I could recognize where Saint Genevieve(the patron saint of Paris, who (she) is said to have saved Paris once from an attack of some barbarians),Victor Hugo, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Marie & Pierre Curie .I couldn’t go to the main place called the Crypt, which hosts the tombs below the chancel, for I had arrived there lately. In the middle of the space, at the intersection of the four transepts, is suspended the Foucault pendulum, right from the centre of the dome. I have to study what its all about! The walls had a lot of big backed pictures and pendentives. The spiral staircases took me, with lot of other tourists, to the peristyle, to have a panoramic view of Paris.I asked to take a picture of mine with the Eiffel tower far behind, in the colonnade, to the lady who guided us to the top. I gave her clear instructions on how the picture should come and where I and the tower should feature. She invariably messed it up! Somehow cameras or the photographers screw up my photos. All the passport photos which I had ever taken, except for the one in my Nortel ID here, have suffered this. Every photographer and camera seem to conspire against my face! So I ditched her and gave the camera to a tall guy and gave the same instructions. To my surprise, he took it almost as I wanted. I was happy. "Where are you from?", he asked. "India. Bangalore". "I am from Mexico". Then I heard the guide cry something in french. I thought he is explaining something and ignored it and was immersed in a bit of day-dreaming. After a couple of minutes, when I realized where I was, there were nobody around. When I looked down, all the other tourists had went down. I could see them on the terrace down there. There was a door open. Then I came around the place to see if anybody else is there. When I reached that door again to go down. It was locked. For a moment I feared being left there. I started yelling "hello" towards the stairs hoping that somebody would hear me. No reply for a couple of minutes. I pushed the button which was besides the door thinking that its some kind of an alarm. No reply for that too. Then I turned back. All the tourists were still standing there staring at me yelling. One of them shouted that the guide is on her way. I felt relieved.  Then I roamed around the latin quarter streets for sometime. Her I came across a treasure trove! Shakespeare & Co! At last I have found a book shop which sells good English books! It was very old. I forgot that the guide book had mentioned about this. There was an odd-tempered very old man owning the shop. The shop too looks pretty old. Theres a reference library in the first floor of the shop. Earlier I had seen one more bookshop in that quarter. But the books were all of those not so meaningful subjects like engineering and technology and science. But this one dealt only with those soulful, and hence comparatively although not completely meaningful subjects like philosophy, literature and art! I bought Les Miserables. When I came out of the shop it started drizzling and I returned to my room.  The next day I roamed around Montparnasse. Hell lot of theatres. Every street atleast has a couple of cinema theatres. And some sex boutiques too. Should look lively in the night. I saw Tour Montparnasse, which was, when it was built, one of Europe's tallest towers. This, I guess is the only skyscraper in the heart of Paris. All others are in the outskirts like La Defense. I didn’t go up the tower for it would have set me back by 8 euros!  The next place in my plan was to visit Cimetiere du Montparnasse (The cemetery of ...), one of Paris's biggest cemeteries. It hosts the tombs of many french prominent personalities across all the fields. I went to see the one of the famous existentialist couple, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, the couple I most envy. They dominated the 19th century philosophic and literary scene of France. I took a couple of small stones from their tomb as memento mori! Some names I would recognize there were Guy de Maupassant and Henri Poincare. I wondered at the man's thirst to be remembered even after death when I saw some strangely designed tombs. I wanted to see the whole of the cemetery but I had to go to Catacombs by 2PM and so I rushed through it.  For the first time, the map in my guide showed a wrong pointer to a place. Because of that I have to disturb some localites there to arrive at the  place of Catacombs. This is a very special place! Napolean, once wanted to clear all the cemeteries in Paris and clean up the city. So he dug up all those and stored all the remains of dead bodies under some 3 'mont's of Paris. One of those is Montparnasse and the place where he put all of the remains is called Catacombs.  I had to go down a seemingly unending spiral staircase to go to the underground storage place. Once my head started rolling and I had to stop for a moment to regain myself! At the entrance there's a warning asking weak-hearted and weak-bodied people not to take the journey!  Then I had to walk some 2 kms underground to arrive at the storage place. The walkway was very narrow and fearful, if alone. Thousands and thousands of skulls and bones. Wow! what a sight to see! Good that I didn’t miss this. For the next 2 kilometres of the maze-like dark alleys which were dimly lit, wherever you turn you see the skulls staring at you. I was petrified at the collection! In some places the underground water was seeping through the roof, making the walk even more difficult. For the next hour or so all I saw were those skulls, the emblem of Death. This is one of those places where I want to go again for I forgot to take a picture of myself with full of skulls and bones in the background. It would have been a marvelous photo.  Then again to come up to the city, I had to enervatingly climb those stairs. I was a lot relieved to see sunlight and brightness! And I was a kilometre or further from where I entered and I had to search my way back.  I was satisfied with the treat of these places and ended my weekend stroll!  Mother Death, it seems, is waiting for me to get matured to reveal herself! Till then I'll enjoy the fun and freedom of being immature.

      With thoughtful books to read, With soulful music to hear, With beautiful places to stroll, With intellectual art and sculpture to tickle my mind, Paris is a paradise!  Sitting at the banks of River Seine, Wear Lucky Ali on your ears, Hold the little finger of Victor Hugo and ask him to walk you through his woods of ideas and now you know how heaven would feel like!  Wanting a change from monuments, churches and museums, I started my weekend with Bois de Bologne. Its a huge garden. Its the remains of a forest which was beside Paris which is well tended now. The atmosphere was absolutely serene, far away from the din and bustle of the traffic and noise of any tourists. Its the best an ultra-cosmopolitan city can do to take its citizens close to nature. There were many people seen around. They had come with their kids and pets and were having their time. You should be an idiot of a bachelor, like me, to go to such a heavenly place, alone without a girlfriend!  There were ponds in between with calm water with birds and ducks and pigeons. I roamed around for some time to drink the beauty and then settled in a calm shady place. I was disturbed by that calmness! To face silence has become difficult for me, for I have to face myself and my stupid questions. Men cant easily live in silence and solitude for they dread to be denuded by that one-word interrogation upon oneself which they have no guts or patience to face. So many prefer to inundate themselves into noise for that reason and die without ever attempting to answer that eternal query.  In the park, I could see a couple of young beautiful girls jogging, a married (hopefully!) couple, an old lady walking with a middle-aged man; maybe her son. How many roles do women play in a man's life from birth to death, I wondered! And I always wonder about the inherent duality of nature. Why should there be men and women? Why did not human beings choose to be asexual? And why should I allow this duality to screw up my life?! But without this duality, I realise that this world which has progressed from molecules to men, would have remained inert and be impotent of any reaction and procreation. Conflict is indispensable for creating harmony. But I don’t understand why should there be any progress or procreation in the first place. Why should there be something? Why not nothing? Isn’t that calmer? Isn’t that more peaceful? Isn’t that beauty? Why should I exist and experience chaos? I dont know. I am clueless. But all I can fathom is Chance and Change are twin directors of life and Love its producer! And I, the actor. How colourful it is, even though meaningless!  There were a lot of children playing around in the garden. I envied them a lot, as I did in Places des Vosges. I felt that this is quite a good environment for children to be brought up. India is not a good place for children to grow up and get educated. Not only that the educational system is hopelessly marred by the mud-headed politicians, but there's a complete dearth of role-models to look up to for kids; dearth of soaring of human spirit, dearth of order, dearth of discipline, dearth of planning and perfection. Children should definitely not be educated in such a place. Their mind would become crippled with the narrowness of their vision. The fundamental and primary objective  of a teacher is to show the ideal and then to teach how to go and attain it. But this happens rarely in Indian schools. No teacher is worth his salt. I have come across only three of the breed of good teachers in my school life, who deserve some respect. India is against the grain to impart soulful knowledge. All it can achieve is to produce meaningless software engineers like me! The calm of Bois de Bologne disturbed me a lot and I walked back to my room, not wanting to disturb myself further and in the evening I walked along Champs-Elyssees with amar and srinand, looking for a compact flash card for my camera and to enquire about the prices of cellphones for suneetha.  Musee Rodin hosts the works of the master sculptor Auguste Rodin. Its placed in one of the 'finest town houses of Paris'. The 'Gates of Hell' welcomed me. Its a very famous work of Rodin and I wondered how the hell he put all these pieces of bronze together. The house had a marvellous and big garden around it were the masterpieces of Rodin are kept. I couldn’t understand why the other sculptures were regarded as anything wonderful, thanks to my blissful ignorance.  Le Penseur (The Thinker) attracted me a lot, if not for any of its scuplting brilliance which I am incognizant of, for its simplicity and profound meaning.At the first sight it reminded me of Rene Descartes's "Cogito ergo sum".He is an exemplary thinker, who set out to build an entire philosophical system from scratch, not believing in any misleading logic, but his own reasoning. I was quite stunned to look at a photograph of him, for he shattered my pet ideas of physiognomy. To put his idea succinctly, denuding the benumbing abstraction of philosophical parlance, he proved that the existence of self is beyond doubt and we exist because we think. He looked a bit ugly outwards(!) as opposed to Rodin who looks like a sage. All this came to my mind with that piece of scultpture. Its powerful. And its so fitting that Rodin's tomb is below this statue.  Inside the house, there are numerous works of Rodin. I liked those erotic statues very much, for their expression. There are only a handful of emotions experienced by human beings that are so severe that however refined is the form of art used to express them, it would never be complete. Sex is one of them. Sex is sublime. That exalted state can be experienced, I believe, if I can check my sixth sense. That’s the reason, I guess, that every sculptor, painter and musician tries his hand at it, to gauge his mastery, against the infinite!  When I see the statues nude and get out of the picture to see myself and all others dressed up and standing there, I feel odd. It’s not the statues which look odd but its our dress! Its as if I dress to conceal my weak body with a frail frame. The statues make me feel ashamed.  In the afternoon, I had been to Tombeau de Napolean and Musee de l'Armee. The tomb (crypt)of the great emperor Napoleon I is kept inside a dome church. The church is quite majestic to look at. Did I read somewhere that it took 27 years to build that dome? What were they doing sitting on that rotunda for so long!!? But the gold gilded dome  with a cross at its zenith, with sun shining as best as He can through the clouds above Paris, it looks splendidly effulgent. Felt like entering the gates of Heaven after having seen the gates of hell at Musee Rodin! When I entered and beheld that massive dome from inside and the beautiful altar of a crucified guy called Jesus Christ, I felt that its quite a fitting place for that emperor's soul to rest in peace if at all it chooses so! Its quite amusing to note that he rose from obscurity to become a glorious emperor. He was extremely brilliant and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. He is also one of the father's of Paris's beauty. If not for anything else I would remember him for being a part in sculpting such a beautiful city. Its a myth that he was short. He was 5'6.5" tall, average height, but half an inch short of mine! This character inspired me to proceed further into Musee de l'Armee where there are exhibits of things used by the Napoleon dynasty and is quite comprehensive. It’s considered one of the best and wide collection in the world of the materials used in a war.  When I entered the museum I was still revelling in that erotic mood which Rodin has managed to create! But suddenly to switch the context from Love to War was difficult! It was quite a complete switch nevertheless, I should say. The museum educated me of the complexities involved in a war with all its exhibits of swords, daggers, pistols, guns, plaques, flags, epaulettes, uniforms, water-cans(!), heavy metal suits, iron masks, ornaments, bonnets, keys and various symbols used by the infantries and regiments. I was stunned by the administrative genius of Napoleon I.I was awe-struck when I came out of the floor. Sheer power. I felt very very puny before that emperor. He is what I call a Man. I felt sad that he was caught as a prisoner of war by England and was sent in exile to St.Helena on southern atlantic and died there. His remains were brought back here by King Louis XIV and was deposited in the Dome church. It was a bit ironic and saddening to see the set up of the prison room in which his soul departed with the bed and chairs originally used by him. He lived only for 52 years on this earth and see the legend he has left behind for us!  It was good to see that the seal of Napoleon I was N which is the first letter of Narayan, the King, too.  There was another floor dedicated to Napoleon III where I saw a rifle. The moment I saw it, I thought there should be something wrong with its design and it should have been very awkward to handle it. If I had been a soldier I would not have used such a rifle for anything. Its not good enough to kill in a swift way. Amazingly my suspicion was proved right by the plaque that read that it was an ill-designed lounge-rifle, with long bayonet (which was the root cause of my doubt!) at the end of the barrel, which was approved by the king and could not be used extensively and hence failed! So I observed that Napoleon III was not as good as his predecessors. Such is the incompetence that dynasty-rule produces. After this I got a bit pensive about the efficiency of the rulers in the systems of democracy and aristocracy. Terrorists do not jump from the skies onto the earth. They are the illustrious sons of democracy whose major achievement is producing incompetent and dumb-headed leaders who only know how to manipulate the sentiment of the majority to their whims. Democracy, in short is the mother of incompetence and corruption. Decisions at any level, from the individual to the government should not be taken by the majority. Majority of the decisions taken by the majority are hopelessly ignorant. Decisions and power should only reside with intellectuals and philosophers. All others, for the sake of good, should submit.  In the evening I didn’t go anywhere. Amar and Srinand taught me how to roller-skate in an open space in La Defense. I had a good time! After 1 hour of practice, I know how to stand up on my own with the roller-skates on! I had a lot of times deliberately avoided many things for the fear of success. I don’t fear failure that much for I am the personification of it! Then when I returned to my room I got a bit moody about success and failure.  Nobody succeeds unless and until he is aware of his success. And nobody fails unless and until he is aware of his failure. And if he is not aware of his failure, he loses the capacity to transmogrify a failure into a success. I bet that every man who had succeeded, in whatever way you define success, has failed marvelously. If he loves success, there has been umpteen moments when he has faced failure with love, for neither success nor failure is what he exactly loves, but the endeavour towards it. Its the journey that matters and bring true ecstasy, not the destination.  Here again I cant stop repining about my state. Even though I realize all the above, my problem is that I am not able to define my journey and make my sleeping spirit wake up and walk through it. Where there's no definite and conscious journey, all the so-called successes and failures fail to impress the soul. It starves. Journey is the soul of life. Destination is only as good as the body to the soul. As if I am standing uncontrollably on a roller-skates, which for the first time I wear on my feet and find it extremely difficult to get up and balance myself and almost impossible to thrust myself forward in a chosen direction, I am being pushed by the strong wind of chances which has any influence only upon those who have no sense of direction and is absolutely harmless for those who know where they are going, into the gates of hell. I feel that I am very near to those gates. But I can see that heaven is not far away but the next door!. Still I cant change my direction for I am stuck with the roller-skates on my foot which I had been wearing all along in my life, which is commonly called Ignorance. I feel like screaming to my throats capacity, for it would give me a ray of hope that somebody in heaven would heed me and take me under their wings. Hope! Unreasonably hope! "You bastard, hope!", I tell to myself.  The next day I've been to a place where I long wanted to go after coming to Paris. Its Espace Montmartre which hosts the museum of the great surrealist Salvador Dali. Dali is considered as a genius in the art of surrealism. His strange mustache will itself tell you his character!  The first work which welcomed me was a famous Dalinian symbol of a fluid watch, which consists of a watch draped over a branch of tree. This flowing fluid image of a clock is the masterpiece of Dali which he exploits to the maximum extent. Its seen repeated in many more works of his. Dali's time is not precise, not rigid and it dances to our thoughts. Its subjective and an extension of human perception. He preaches, through his works, that man must learn to strike a balance between time and life, to maximize the gift of life.  There was a sculpture which depicted the nobility of time, with a woman symbolizing desire, reality and this material world and with an angel which is a simile for the deeply religious nature of a human being. In between these 2 there stands the Dali clock to preach that inspite of the other two feelings which drive man in his daily life, time reigns, with a crown on its head.  There were many more sculptures like 'Space Elephant' which were amusing. He uses egg to symbolize the intra-uterine life and re-birth. That’s a good idea!  I was able to appreciate even some of his paintings, thanks to the placards that were in English beside each sculpture and painting. He paints and tells stories in his own surrealistic way. He has painted Bible, Alice in Wonderland to name a few. When I was climbing up to reach the entrance, after I was done, I saw many poses of him with some questions and answers which were interesting. I could remember these: What is ugliness? Disorder. What is beauty? Harmony. Why do you wear (such a strange!) mustache? In order to pass unobserved! What is surrealism? Surrealism is myself. Do you think that a painter of your style belongs in our atomic era? Certainly. I personally indulge in atomic explosions.  After this I roamed around the beautiful Montmartre area in the streets back to the Sacre-Couer church. Then returned to my room and wonder about this subject of surrealism, which has always been with me, so beautifully portrayed by Dali. I thought that if his works are called and celebrated as works of a genius, I could produce thousands of ideas like those. After all I am a surrealist of myself!   N.

      Thanks to Nellai(Nellaiappan Soundarrajan) for lending me his laptop to record my thoughts over the weekend.I missed gvim, for Windows always expects her users to be pretty dumb!  I would love to live and die in Paris for it treats me so well, even though I have no ideals to live upto or die for.   I was in Rue Mechain to start my weekend for the sake of Vidya, my teammate and friend.The administrative headquarters of the school in which she studied, the St.Joseph de cluny in Malleshwaram,Bangalore, is located here in Paris and she wanted me to get some photos of it.  The street was barren and it was drizzling a lot. I thought it would be a holiday and thought of taking some pictures of the street and the door of the building and return. Also since I could roam around only in the weekends, it would be difficult to come in the weekdays and satisfy her wish. After taking a couple of snaps I went near the door. It had no numeric keypad which most of the doors in the houses of Paris have, but a button to press. I hoped it was a calling bell. I heard a couple of rings on pressing it. No response. Slowly I pushed the door to see that it was opened. A receptionist welcomed me. I explained her the purpose of my being there. She asked me to wait for sometime and went away to fetch a sister. There was no school inside as opposed to my belief. But it was a mother house and it hosted a church.  While waiting for the sister, another sister turned up in that room and before I could grasp  her face completely, she thrust a T-shirt into my hand and said, "Have it" and went away without waiting for any answer as if I am there to receive whatever they give! I didn’t want to act rudely there. So I kept the T-shirt, for I should hand it over to Vidya, who was the root cause for it!  The sister whom I am supposed to wait for turned up and took me to a small meeting room. After my introduction, I came to know that her name was sister Violet and she is basically a Tamilian, whose family is in Bangalore and who is in Paris for 6 years now! She started conversing in Tamil. She took me to all the gardens and the church inside .She started with a tree whose seed was sown by the founder of the institution, St.Anne-Mary XYZ, which was almost 200 years old. Beside the church is the crypt (the tomb) of the founder. She said that in the box kept there, the heart of the lady is preserved! Then she showed me the office buildings and the sisters' residence.  Then when we were walking along a garden, as if she could connect two different things, she asked, "Do you know to solve computer problems?". She didn’t know that she is asking a guy who has slogged in a call-center like a night-watchman troubleshooting PC problems! But that necessarily doesn’t mean that she would be as dumb as some of those US customers! "Yes." "Then I have a problem with my PC. Will you solve it?" "Sure." The stroll came to an abrupt end and she took me to her room where the PC was.From whatever she explained I understood that PC doesnt play audio.Its 5 years old and all along it has been like that with the dumb speakers staring at her and the poor lady has been watching her movies in another sister's room!She had tried calling up the technical support for no avail.They had replied that the essential software is already installed!Then she gave all the CDs that has been supplied with the PC.Here in Paris, she explained that even if you buy a PC, nobody comes to your house to install it or troubleshoot it.She had set the system up herself following the instructions given in the manual.Good job, I thought.After fumbling around for half an hour, I could install the right device driver for her sound card and made it work.She played a Tamil movie DVD and shouted, "Thank You.Thank You.", on hearing the sound. "Do you eat pork, beef and things like that?". I was taken aback a bit. "No. I am a vegetarian. But I'll take egg too". Then she took me to a dining room. And gave me cooked carrot, cauliflower, mashed potato and some bread and cheese. She made some coffee too. In the midst she brought some prawn pickle and told me so. "What is it?!" "Fish. Vegetarians eat fish. Dont they?" "Sorry. I don’t take it". "How come you do you eat these bland things with not much taste?". I kept mum. I thought curd rice is enough to keep me going.  After conversing a bit she said, "Am happy to see you.", with absolutely no sign of it in her face. All along, until this statement I was comfortable. But the way she delivered it injected a feeling of uneasiness in me and I wanted to move out of the place as soon as possible. I hate people whose heart and tongue do not express the same. She came until the main road and showed me the way to the nearest metro station. By now I had grown very uncomfortable about her and the place. I walked fast without turning back.  Religion is a dead body. For me, a perfect religion is dynamic. Nobody can come out with frozen rules and regulations for a dynamic entity. Does it sound like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle on the motion of electrons? My religion should be shaped every minute according to the tune of my soul by myself. Only I know how it dances. That is religion with life, for it evolves with me. Once I freeze it and write down stringent rules to be followed, the soul runs away as fast as He can and leaves the dead frozen body in my hands, useful for nothing and which would stink like hell. The stinking body would only attract vultures to it! Vultures do not have the necessary competence to catch their own live prey. They wait for something to be dropped down as useless, to pounce upon. I can see these rapacious vultures in contemporary religious leaders.  Musee Grevin is equivalent to Madame Tussaud's of London, hosting wax statues. The entrance to it had long set of mirrors which faced each other at an angle to produce infinite number of reflections. I realized that the entrance fee was 13 euros and walked back. Not worth it for somebody who converts euros into rupees before spending!  In that area of Fauborg Montmartre, there are ancient shopping complexes. They date back to 1800's! Every shop is unique. There were a lot of cafe restaurants in which much of romance was going on. I thought this is the place where I want to be, for it has life and expression. I felt relieved a bit. There were shops for philately, vintage photographic devices, books from gay sex to history of France, figurines of every character that you can imagine for kids. The place had a Paris touch, which always leaves a pleasant feeling behind. Inside one of those shopping complexes and on Rue de Fauborg Montmartre I spotted a couple of chocolate shops, handmade chocolates. The smell out of those shops made my mouth water! They were so rich.  But still I couldnt quite get out of the bitterness of that mother-house. So I consulted the map and among the few choices I had, chose the farthest one! It was Parc de la Villette. The guide said it hosted a science and technology complex. Thought that the place would be interesting, but not as quite as art or sculpture.  But when I was done for the day, I was equally satisfied! Its personally a healthy sign that science and technology can impress me as much as art! It was a big complex with various centers like Explora which hosted the permanent and temporary science exhibitions, Cite des Enfants which is a children's science village, centers for shows and films, forums and conferences. I chose  to go to 'The Geode', one of the theatres there playing short-movies, which Marc had told me would be good. It was, indeed. The geode is a sphere. And hence the screen of the theatre is a spherical surface, which is the speciality, as we see in planetariums. But the films that are screened seem to be special documentaries. Each film lasts for an hour. I have to choose one among the 5 films; "L'Inde' Tigre" whose hero is the bengal tiger and which is inspired by Jim Corbett who pioneered the Indian wildlife conservation, "Adrenaline" which studies sky-diving, "Station Spatiale" which is the story of the world's first international space station or otherwise an orbiting research lab and the people who built it, "La legende de l'etalon noir" which is about the friendship between a lonely girl in a desert and a young black stallion, "SolarMax" which depicts the humankind's struggle to understand the Sun. I could quickly narrow down to the last two.And the phrase 'struggle to understand' which prettily rings along the same line as  my state, decided the film.  They had given me a wireless headphone for hearing English audio instead of French and hence I could decipher and enjoy the film. The film was fantastic. It was written, produced and directed by John Weiley. It explained how our forefathers studied the sunlight to mark the start of the year, about Aristotle's geo-centric universe(I was very happy to see his face), the genius of Copernicus who propounded the heliocentric solar system, Galileo Galilei who built the first ever telescope to view the objects in the sky and confirmed Copernicus's proposition, how he was shown the tools of torture by the then government of his to make him accept that he is speaking nonsense (!).Here I thought that when there's a clash between an intellectual and a society, its always the society which loses the battle in the long run, irrespective of the immediate outcome , even if the individual is killed as is the case of Socrates, for intellectuals are dynamic and society tends to be static and hence falters. The point where dynamism should necessarily succeed the static rule is seen, by commons, as a revolution, which inevitably leads to another higher state and wait for another revolution to take it further above! It takes a genius of a character like Mohandas.K.Gandhi to design and spearhead a revolution without a single drop of blood. India, if not for anything else, can be proud for having produced this prodigal son who claims to have experimented with truth when I am struggling to discern it.  Art is waiting for another Picasso and science is waiting for another Einstein. This is how we climb the staircase of civilisation.  The two shows in planetariums, which I had seen in India, stopped with Galileo, as if he is the most recent and modern astronomer.But the film came far ahead.It went on to explain about the sun's dark spots, study of sun's composition through spectrography which was very neatly and  succintly put as based on the property of elements to absorb a unique wavelength of light to leave a unique signature in the spectrum, the way kids could easily understand, Berkelin's theory that sun spews out energy symmetrically through both of its poles and how humanity has to wait until man's first space voyage to confirm this hypothesis through videographing sun spewing out its corona, how earth is protected from sun's flares by its magnetosphere, how a couple of thousands of satellites placed around earth influence our daily life, how SOHO was built and placed a million miles from earth balancing exactly the forces of gravity due to earth and the sun to capture the sun's activity directly, how it was troubleshooted by the international NASA team for a silly mistake of their own which turned the system dead, where do we draw the frontier of science and technology now, role of the various observatories all over the world, how they form a chain to study the sun. A notice at the start of the film said that none of the images of the sun were created by computer animation, but were original images captured by various observatories around the world. I was very much satisfied with the film and its content and the way it was presented keeping in mind the level of knowledge of its audience. Brilliant.  I badly wanted something to drink and for the first time in Paris, I bought something to drink, a cup of Expresso Cafe and settled on a chair there.  The children I see here are pretty cute, with their rosy skin, blonde hair, tender lips, chubby jackets, faltering gait, questioning innocent deep stares. All over the world, children are the same. I feel like kissing these children on their cheeks and hugging them and playing with them and answering to their questions with utmost sincerity and successfully pass over atleast a part of my chaos to them! I want to grab all these nascent minds and make them grow as intellectuals. I was very angry then with the kind of range and method of education that the schools which I studied were able to deliver, when I wanted to learn something in my tender age and as good as now, when I was completely ignorant of my goals. I was very upset so much so that I wanted to build a school and create revolutionary concepts in imparting knowledge and which spews out nobel laureates! I would take pieces of coal as students and turn them into diamonds of immense value through the infinite energy of knowledge, by inspiring their elements to point towards one direction. I'll cultivate intelligence and harvest knowledge in the lands called their minds. I would make sure that these lands remain fertile by giving them enough nourishment from outside. I would deploy the best minds in this world to impart them the education. My school will have all the subjects ever touched upon by humanity and invent many more. Geniuses in art, sculpture, philosophy, literature, science, engineering, sports, music will be created. A student would pass out as a complete human being and a powerhouse of knowledge in his chosen field of study. The necessary and sufficient qualification for getting into my school would be the will to learn, the hunger for knowledge. And the necessary qualification to sustain oneself there, would not be the fee, but the love of his job. The system would be such that it would automatically eject out the incompetent or uninterested. Along the course of education from kindergarten to a doctorate every step, the tenure of it, the speed of it, the style of it, its composition, its breadth and depth, will be decided by the individual himself. There will be no admission based on age, race, religion, caste, previous field of study or any other bullshit. All  I needed were proper motivation and inspiration. I didn’t find one worthy blackguard who could deliver these. I'll create my own Men. I have never felt at home when I was in school or college. My children who study in my school will feel completely at home, with tremendous deal of motivation and inspiration around. This will come from the kind of teachers I have deployed and they'll be envied all over the world for the kind of pay that they would receive from me. I'll make these teachers, the gods of knowledge, as a bunch of richest men in the world. My eyes were hot with anger and as if to cool themselves they oozed out tears and they ran down to cool my face too! Its a shame on me that, for the first time, I cried in public. I said to myself, "Get up. Don’t cry in public again. And don’t dream in public again." I immediately mopped my tears and put the coffee cup in the dustbin and walked out of the place to the room. For the day, I can’t suffer anymore.  Since I am not yet 25 years old, I could visit almost all the places with 'reduit tarif'! This has saved me some euros. I had to give only 4.10 euros as against the usual rate of 6.10  to visit the Conciergerie.  The conciergerie is called so, for it was the office and residence of 'the concierge'( the keeper ) of the King, who was vested with lots of power. The entrance was a huge hall complete with Gothic archs. It looked royal. It has been originally constructed as an office but later many cells were added which made it the bloodiest prison in the history of France. After the great revolution in 1792, the accused who were thousands in number including personalities from all walks of life from peasants to emperors have been guillotined here. The prisoners faced only two options once they were brought in: freedom or death. Still I could smell the suffering of those hearts there, for the authorities have managed to keep the ambience intact and replay those events through documentaries and pictures well.  I could not even imagine the kind of suffering of the people who were sentenced to death would have gone through. If natural death disturbs me so much, how much these people on whom death has been imposed by heartless savages could have got disturbed? I wondered. It should have been a deadly agony for I read that some of them committed suicide with raw tools that they managed to procure there. The paintings there depicted the feelings who were guillotined en-masse in Place de la Revolution which is now the Place de la Concorde. Very somber. Man's intelligence is so paltry that nobody can ever manage to create a soul. I do not know who has any moral prerogative to put an end to one. No individual or government is qualified to bring an end to somebody's life, not even their own. Its the nadir of justice and the zenith of evil to award a judgement to a fellow human being as to end his life. Its not fair by any moral or ethical standards.  I came out with a heavy heart from that erstwhile prison.  Outside it was raining heavily and the weekend was marred by a pretty bad weather for sightseeing.So I returned to my room and continued my dreaming!  With her long lithe legs,  the lustful shape of the seat of her pants, the fatal curves of her pelvic girdle exposed neatly by her tight jeans, slender sleek waist, voluptuous bump of her bosom drawn by her skin-tight tops, shining shoulders, slender rosy fingers, svelte lines of her face, cherry red seductive lips, the lovely pink skinny cheeks, the wavy upperlip with its minute pale-brown hairs, the tip of the nose which has been made red by the blood rushing to rescue her white glowing skin against the chill wind which splits itself at that point notwithstanding the fast gait of hers, soft thick pink earlobes, the blue eyes which pierce into mine, the look of disdain as if she descends from heaven and I have dug myself up from the netherworld, the flaring forehead, the golden blonde hair which cascades down on her shoulders, the young french girl looks like an angel and disturbs me a lot. I've enjoyed seeing these features in the same fashion described atleast a few hundred times and I don’t think I'll ever get bored of it! The chill weather increases the need for warmth!  I saw the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life a couple of weeks ago. Her features had a deadly perfection. She was taller than me. She had the kind of face I would love to see every night. Being so close to me physically in a metro, her face told me that she is still unsullied. I couldn’t take my eyes off her blue ones till she disappeared from  my purview. Phew! It pained. I have not heard of a bachelor king. So my queen should be skulking somewhere out there. I should find her out. But how?!  Lets see! Lets Hope!  N.
