      rainy days always make me feel lazy... *yawn*  buti na lang i'm not in my hyper mood or i would've gotten pissed na naman sa techpoint (where the office bought my pc). eng eng kasi mga tao, i told them i wanted a P4 last year and the darn pc that arrived was a stoooppppid celeron 2.0GHz. ayan tuloy! wa pang one year, malapit na bumigay! (di pa ko hyper inis nito ha?) stupid processor can't handle the stress i put it through hahaha 0rpm na ang CPU fan speed when i checked hardware monitor a while ago. buti napansin ko ang init. i thought napapraning lang ako when i felt the cpu tower was hot....di pala!  maybe if the weather gets better tomorrow, i might make talak our purchasing why they bought a stoooopid celeron.  *yawn*

      oo na! mababaw na ako! i just don't like it when people do this. yes, it is my pet peeve. i can't help it. i was born this way.  some PM here borrowed my pencil kasi gagamitin daw ng director. kanina pa yun. when i checked again, they're both gone...with my pencil! i'm so attached pa naman to that pencil...it's my favorite. it's a rotring 0.5 mechanical pencil. it's only my second rotring in 10 years. my first just gave up on me. ganon! and i just can't accept na mawawala lang itong isa dahil sa kagagahan ng PM na ito! burarang old maid yun! pweeehh! leche!!  grrr....  i'm so inis!  *murmur* *grumble*

      what do you do to relax?  because i can't seem to do that nowadays... it's like i'm always harrassed (tama ba spelling? cute kasi ako kaya bobo sa spelling eh) and stressed out whether i'm in the office, at home or even in church. they say that one sign of stress is falling hair? is that true? siguro, kasi grabe maglagas ang hair ko this past year. numinipis na nga ang hair ko...had those bald patches about a year ago...scared the hell out of me!! (i was like "my hair!!!" and also "yoko makalbo!") tumubo naman sila ulit thank god!   but today.... mygas! i discovered one very tiny patch again near my puyo....my goodness! go buy na naman ako ng minoxidil nyan! so expensive pa naman!!  halp! what do you do to relax?   1. take a looonnnggg leave of absence and turn off your cellphone so no one can reach you? 2. ask for a transfer to another less stressful department? or  3. find another less stressful job altogether?  after those three choices above, the issue now would be that: 1. i like where i'm at now (mga tao lang ang pampastress eh) 2. dyahe sa owner ng company because i know them personally and i love them  haaayy!!
