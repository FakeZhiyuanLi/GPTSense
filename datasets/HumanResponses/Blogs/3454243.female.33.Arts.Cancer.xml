       The moon is almost half full. I'm staring at it through my window, listening to george carlin and pondering yearning. It has plagued me all week, a yearning for something, anything to make me feel. I often get these flights of dissatisfaction. There was a time I moved cross country on a whim and a weeks notice, with little money and no plans.  I had a like minded Gypsy partner then who was just as fly by the seat of the pants as I was. Now that he has taken The Great Trip (death), I have seemed to have lost my verve. Now I sit waiting to go to bed to start the road to hell afresh tomorrow (the Desk Job). This is why I yearn: I have had it more exciting and can't seem to find my way back. I yearn for the time to pursue my art. I crave travel. Especially I crave jack. Maybe because he is freedom, or represents it. I want to be the little bohemian girl again, and it will take a grand statement to do it. It will take an act of courage or bravery so profound, or so stupid, to cause a seismic rift. All I need to find is the door. The night is ripe for a talk with Hecate to send in some Chaos to stir things up.

      shooting away from my body I seek jack in his boxers, sleeping waiting for me outside  my wraith hits him full speed lashes though his soul the soulblood mixes entwining  our plasma mixing in cake swirls not knowing the end or  the beginning of knowing  knowing that me and mine and he and his are the same even briefly  for my soul must part his back to the mundane sharing the mixings oneness  -zezrie 06/26/04-

         It amazes me how a day can start completely in the toilet and then redeem itself before sundown. The existence of once again another woman in Dan's life had me questioning my own desirability. Also, I was pondering the use of all the changes in my life, if they were worth the trouble. Distinguished job (though it's not what I want to do really), 60 lbs lost, and some semblance of balance has entered my life, sans a trustworthy lover. Thus, I was not in a good mood this morning. The work day was seamless enough, though busy as usual  (I work for a university graduate school). Then the cardiologist's appointment was upon me. Though I am a runner, I have heart palpitations and was worried. I got a confirmation that yes, I do have a heart beat problem, but I wasn't going to die for another 50 years. So I walked out of the doctor's office and looked down the street, where a previous lover owns a business. I had not seen Mark in about a year, and then I was a bald (I shaved my head), grieving basket case. An urge to see him just propelled me down the street. The look of  delighted astonishment on his face when I walked in was worth all the crap I have endured this week. Now I am much thinner, my hair is on my shoulders, and my confidence is back. On my way home I had this thought: my life is good, I like my solitude, and a lover meant for me will come across my path sooner rather than later. The run tonight was fabulous, and the runner's high on top of the feel good ending to the day reconfirmed that all the lessons learned, pain endured, and humiliation has been worth it. I feel capable of going through the transition of moving away from Dan and to a better place with someone I deserve.                                                       "I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you                                                      That its impossible to get along with you                                                Its hard to look you in the face when we are talking                                                        So it helps to have a mirror in the room                                               I've not been really looking forward to the performance                                              But there's my cue and there's a question on your face                                                      Fortunately I have come across an answer                                                                       Which is go away                                                                  And do not leave a trace"                                                                                 -Jack-

       My skin is crawling, hands shaking. I feel like I want to run, but don't know where to. Alas I am in the beginning stages of an anxiety attack. The magic I did last night feels like it went loopy, like I didn't ground right. Dan and I are probably separating. It is a good thing too, we may be good friends but he cannot offer me the future I need. I've been doing sex magic to try to stem the loneliness, but can't seem to shake the blues. Today is Midsummer, a high holiday, so doing magic tonight will be powerful. Maybe tonight I can shake some of this unease. Dreamed of Jack again last night, for whatever reason. I need to feel close to someone, so my astral buddy will have to do for now.

      Move over children, Let’s get comfortable now.  We can talk to the animals.  We can breathe with our brothers.  We can hope for the best.  We can challenge the mind. We can open up and rush forward blood vessels upon the ground. We can deliver fresh food to someone who cannot get it themselves. So why do I worry so violet? Why do I need more from you and more from life? Why is it that I don’t become satisfied?  Cannot we break that rule? Cannot we break the tradition of mind? Satisfaction is death. Satisfaction is death. Satisfaction is death. It is the pursuit of happiness that brings us happiness, and not the happiness achieved. I thought about this yesterday too. So violet, will you then ever be satisfied with me? You need to constantly pursue me. You need to chase after something in me,  Always. You can never be satisfied with me, I hope you cannot.  I hope you cannot. Let’s pursue this further.   Jack 09/18/03

         Went to see Tony C and the Truth in concert again tonight, there second time in town. The blues was swirling round my mind and I felt him, for the first time in many months. A memory flashed...Savannah, GA on the waterfront. Walking past a saxophone player, John handed the man a 10 and asked him to play his wife some blues. He was like that, he remembered and did little things to never let me forget I was his kindred spirit. The songs, the guitars, the crowds must have stirred him. This man went to the first Woodstock, and followed the Rolling Stones on a tour. As the music roared, my pentacle grew warm and I had the memory. He was there beside me once again, laughing at the antics of the other concert goers...His arms around my waist as he always did during concerts. The pentacle that I wear was a gift from him and was over his heart when it had its last beat. I suppose his essence will always be part of it.    Dan, my current lover, does not give me that kind of joy. He is smart and funny, but not empathetic to me. He never remembers little things about me like John did. Dan doesn't take my faith seriously, whereas John converted to witchcraft for love of me and then grew into a splendid witch. I often sit and wonder if I am meant to have another man that connected to me, as John was. There has been times I have caught myself wistfully thinking of my astral lover Jack, his funny weird ways and formidable talent. The problem with astral lovers is that it is very likely you will never meet them in person. Some call astral lovers daydreams, projections of what you want ideally in yourself and others that usually are too perfect to be real. This I don't buy into. I believe that astral lovers come to you to give you comfort, to be there in times of crisis and joy. It is an intimacy that cannot be matched. I have heard of astral lovers meeting and actually marrying in like two days (LOL) after they see each other in person. To them the courtship has been ongoing..Why waste time. That is what happened with John and I: we met and then married after three months. I really don't think we were astral lovers, just two people who recognized connected souls when we saw them. I am thankful of this. I just sit and bide my time now, dallying with Dan and visiting Jack in my head when I have time. And feeling John's spirit in places and situations where we were once happy.

      Hecate always seems to smile at me this time of month. She knows I'm her child, and my life revolves around the constant chaotic change she dishes to me. The Moon is dark for three nights starting tonight, a time to stir things up. My ceremony was long last night to celebrate the mystery of no light. One can be anything in darkness...as evil as they dream, or as good as they fear. My wants are simple: a companion to explore the mysteries with. I prayed for Jack as I always do, the dream man I will never have; and John. Yes John, the husband I gave to Hecate and Hades in the circle where he drew his last breath. I laughed, thinking that with all the awesome power of craft at my hands I will always want the men I can never have. At least, the ones I cannot have unless I wield the Gift. So I cast the circle, call the quarters, and invite my Patroness and Patron to join me. I ask for my need (Jack), then give them all the power my orgasms can burst forth. The spell washed over me in my release, and I hoped Jack felt my love for him. My sleep was quick but troubled as it always is, even after magic. Dreams of snakes and dark hungry eyes always follow dark moon workings for me. The peace of the dark comforts me, hides me from my faults and fears and insecurities: since, after all, one cannot be judged if they can't be seen.    My workings for the next two nights shall be for the quick, violent, chaotic change that I crave. I hate being ordinary, mediocre; yet it is all I seem to accomplish without my Dark Lady's help. I do not call for evil nor do I fear it..The dark simply is a cleansing bath that lets you feel like the air.

       I just picked up a book at our local new age bookstore/head shop called The Ethical Slut. Now I am all for sex that has more freedom than just being chained to another. I loved my husband: I was faithful the whole time and adored him. Really I didn't want another...I was also very young. Now that 33 has hit me I feel the overwhelming urge to just have a slew of fuckbuddies without the drama I have with Dan. If the right one came along I would be faithful, I know myself too well not to believe that. It is just that right now I yearn to have more. I tried the BDSM thing ( I am submissive), and the freedom of the relationship is what thrilled me. Once a week I met with an intelligent, cultured man and explored my darkside for a while (thanks Doug wherever you are!!). Then the rest of the week I had my life and he had his, it was wonderful. No drama, no stress, no bullshit.   There are two things that make me just ache to try this lifestyle. For one, just having outside contacts with others would be wonderful. I am very much a loner and enjoy my privacy..This is why my house is a mess. It is an excuse not to have others into my private Batcave. However, I have gotten so good at seclusion that I yearn to have contact. A lot of this has to do with Dan and his jealousy, which frankly I have had enough of. I want to have a circle of friends with who I can share myself with, intellectually, socially, and sexually. I miss intimacy. Secondly, I really want the sex. I want to try everything that has to do with interaction with another (or several) that has the pure magic of sharing each others bodies . I am loving, affectionate, passionate and curious and want an outlet for this energy. Sex magick only takes you so far by yourself. There is nothing more magical than giving another soul pleasure and accepting the gift of pleasure back from them. Even one night stands have a certain amount of meaning if you want to share pleasure for pleasures sake, not looking for Mr. Right, just enjoying the moment of touching JUST TO TOUCH with no deeper trauma.   Am I becoming narssisistic in my old age? Am I giving in to my early-30ies hormonal surge? Am I just bored? Probably all of the above in greater and lesser degrees. I astrally projected the other night to talk to jack about it. His opinion is that love shared with others for the sake of just loving is a precious thing, and for me not to feel scared or ashamed. This is why he's my spiritual guide..He encourages me to go for things I never would before.

       I am constantly amazed at the way the Goddess has ways to tell you that life is good, and...everythings ok. The week was long, work was long, life drug me down like a feedsack I was pulling behind me. My metaphor for life right now is running. If the day sucks, the run usually takes the stress away and gives me a nice runners buzz for the rest of the evening. Lets not kid ourselves, I won't be in the Olympics. The pounding of my feet, my heart racing and concentraiting on oxygen normally kicks the ass of anything bothering. Thus if the run sucks, the day is fucked and unredeemable. Today I had a nice epiphanious run that gave me hope.  Ran around the first corner, and got a yelp of encouragement from the local college guys that live on that street. Normally, the comments screamed at me are usually not repeatable in daylight, but not today. A few hundred yards later I was getting ready to go by a hippy kid that I see around, but have never spoken to. 4 feet away he asked if I wanted a lavender flower (there is a local nursery that grows them along that street). I was touched, I haven't gotten a flower of any kind from any man in forever. I'm in midstride so I can't stop, so I tuck it into my bandana around my head and trot on after smiling and thanking him on the way past. The smell of lavender in my hair, the ease of my steps today, combined with the dopamine kick sent me into a trance as I cruised around the second corner. I finally went around the third corner to the hill that normally kicks my ass. Half way up someone yells out a car window, "don't quit you can do it". Three big messenges in one run: I had to ponder the meaning during my cooldown/stagger on the way home. I've been praying all week for a sign that life is serenely moving the way I want it and this run was what I needed. A nice, Zen-witch moment from Hecate stating that the life transformation was on course and with little turbulence, for now. I sit here sweaty, stinky, and calm with a runners buzz. Everything's ok.

         "Everything’s Okay (Chris Jonat)"   The Clumsy Lovers  You think – you think you think too much  But it’s not about when, it’s all about what  If you use your eyes and forsake your touch  You might hit for average but you’ll choke in the clutch   You wonder – you wonder wonderful things  So far beyond your reasoning  You throw back your head you start to sing  But you catch yourself, you get your bearings – why did you need your bearings?   You believe – believe belief’s beyond you  Belief belongs to the blessed few  You divine water and hope and the blues  But it don’t mean much when it don’t ring true   You worry – you worry words won’t work  When winged wonders wonder what you’re worth  You have strong suspicions and you’d like to be sure  If words make you sick there must be a cure – why don’t you take the cure?   Hey, everything’s okay  Put those other thoughts away  Let me hear you say, at least for today  Everything’s okay  (Live so you live the life you’re leading  If you lose the groove don’t move the groove’s repeating  If you come undone it’s from the words you’re heeding)   You’ve seen – you’ve seen scenes so serene  Like red makes you rage but you sleep to green  And you try to determine what it could mean  That it’s full and rich but pure and lean   And you sigh – size up your surroundings  See the colors and all that they bring  You try to choose from all the offerings  You get right rooted, thinking of your bearings – but then you start to sing   If you want to improve  Get your mind into a groove  And let it play  All that you have to do  Is get your mind into that groove  And try to keep it that way

      Grey is a old friend from high school that sends me timely things just at the point where I am about to go postal. This is his latest inspiration:  The Farmer, The Donkey & The Well  One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.   He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.   A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.   As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!   Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.                                 Remember these five simple rules to be happy:   1. Free your heart from hatred - ! Forgive.   2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.   3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.   4. Give more.   5. Expect less                                            NOW Enough of that crap .. .   The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.                                     MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:   When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass, it almost always comes back to bite you.

      8 days ago I got to see people I hadn't seen in 15 years, my old high school class mates. I missed my 10th reunion because I was in Oregon and not Kentucky. Of course I went into it scared shitless and having all the high school paranoias and wounds opened up. Then I got there and was shocked but shouldn't have been. Everyone was older, wiser, fatter, and more human than 1989. I was surprised on the baldness of the guys I thought were so hot then; and the guys who were average then who found hotness in the passing years (yep that's you Wilbo and Henderson!!). The cheerleaders who ignored me were hugging me like a lost sister. And finally, some of my puberty sexual fantasies were finally realized: two big high school studs actually hugged and talked with me for a while. Sigh. So I feel that I healed quite a bit last weekend, like that part of my life is closed FINALLY.

       I lost my mind and finally participated in my first 5K last night. I finished in the top 2600..not bad for a 5000 people race. came home intending to smoke a celebratory joint, but collapsed from exhaustion the natural way. I want to use this blog to thank Scott Clark. He was a roommate and good friend in the early 90's, as well as a marathon runner. This guy could eat 6000 calories in a day just to keep his energy going. For thirteen years I have wanted to have his energy, determination, and discipline. It is only now that I found it. The race wasn't pretty, but I made it. And for Dan, who even though admitted to seeing 2 other women besides me (:P)walked half way though the race with me--thank you too.
