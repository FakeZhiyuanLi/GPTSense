      I just read Erica's blog. I had been waiting for her to post. She said a lot of stuff and it just really bugs me. Yesterday, it took so much to just try to get myself to ask her if she wanted to be there for my birthday. I honestly really wanted her there but it was a question of whether  she  wanted to be there. I didn't know and I was afraid she'd ignore me or just say no. I really missed her and wished everything could be okay again. I got myself to ask her and she said she could come. I saw Martin's display picture on MSN and thought it was really funny. It was a picture of him and Roger on White Water Canyon, looking really scared. The funny & cute part of the picture is the fact that they were really little. As in age-wise. It was just priceless. I thought about Erica the moment I started laughing at it and I knew that she was probably still mad at me and wanted me "out of her life". Since she wasn't ignoring me, I decided to tell her to look at Martin's display picture and said that I hoped it would bring a smile on her face. She couldn't see it so I told Martin to send it to her. He said I was a good friend to do that but I'm not so sure about that... She got it at last and thought it was funny too, I think. She said "lol" or something so yeah. I just assumed she liked it. We talked a bit more about other things and yeah. She has no idea how badly I wanted things to be back to the way they were. No idea. I really wanted everything to be okay again, before this whole thing.   In her blog, she said that she was gonna take back what she said but then she read her comment on her blog page and wasn't so sure again. It was I who left a comment on her blog page. I wrote some stuff to clarify some things and I... I said that it wouldn't be a problem to stay out of her life. I guess I was just letting my pride get in the way again. I know that it  isn't  a problem, but it's not something I want to live with. Like I said, no matter what happens Erica would always be the one I go running to anyway. Even with the littlest things. She says I lecture her but I wouldn't know if I do or not. I don't mean to do a lot of things that I do. I mean, I'm me! It's typical of me to not know what I'm doing half the time. I think before I act or speak most of the time too!   I've tried acting perfect and nice. I've tried being Miss Nice Person but it's just... not me. Does everyone really think I love little kids? Sure, they're cute! Sure, they're nice! But I only like kids when they're nice! I wanna freak out everytime they start climbing all over me or bug me when something needs to be done that's actually serious with my friends. They  do  get on my nerves! But most of the time, I try to keep on a smile and just laugh along with them. Some of them are really nice (sincerely), some of them are annoying, and some of them just like bugging me on purpose. I'm not super-friendly. I'm not a great listener. I don't give the best advice in the world... And most of all, I act like a mom to Erica more than a best friend because I care about her a lot and I don't want anything to happen. Yeah, I guess I'm over-protective, but it's only 'cos I care. She knows I do.  It hurted that she had second thoughts about things. I really missed her. I wanted to be back in her life. I wanted things to be back to the way they were... even if we got on each other's nerves all the time. I love Erica as a best friend... I still care. Even if she wants me out of her life, I'd still care about what she does... I can't do anything about what she does but I still care so much... I just want her back.

      There are only 10 days left until I go to Hong Kong. So much has happened and this trip to Hong Kong may not be the best thing that's happening right now. As predicted, Nima didn't call last night but whatever. I told him to call Jordan first anyway since Jordan was looking for him. I knew Jordan can be and is an asshole so I didn't want to put up with his rude and disturbing comments. "get the fuck off the phone with nima" wasn't exactly the nicest way to ask me to get off the phone with Nima when we weren't even on the phone to start with. His mom was using the phone on a long-distance call. Jordan has some pretty nice manners, doesn't he?  To be honest, I'm not too comfortable with the fact that Nima and Erica are "close". I  think  they are close again, not sure. He put her back in his "Important People" section of his MSN so yeah. I don't know... I'm just uncomfortable with it. Don't know why. He's got 11 people in his "Important People" list and 7 of them are girls. The remaining 4 are guys. How am I supposed to feel about that? No idea. Whatever.   Sometimes I get jealous of Alice even. I know, Alice is Nima's best friend and it's unreasonable to be jealous of her but still, it's natural... can't help it. I mean, earlier, when we went to the school and they played hockey, why did Nima have Alice's keys? She had pockets and stuff but why would he have them?   At times, I even wonder to myself why I liked Nima. Why did I like him if sometimes he bugs me so much? Why? But I guess it's all in the feelings I have toward him.  I'm seriously really worried about high school. I try to not think about it but I'm afraid of losing him. There are gonna be a lot of really nice and really pretty girls in his classes. What if one day he starts falling for one of them like he did for Sara and other people? I don't know... I'm just afraid of losing him.  Another thing, I've come to realize that through all these years, things have changed so much. I mean, when I first met Martin, he was the kid who hung out with Rachel a lot and the guy I kept pinching and kicking. As we grew up, he's now one of my best guy friends. I'm really grateful for having a friend like him.   Also, I was talking to Ingrid on the phone yesterday... she said that sometimes she can get pretty possessive. I wasn't sure what she meant by that and she was talking about our older friends at church. People like Jay, Will, etc. She felt possessive towards them because Katie and Erica now talk to them more and they all know Katie and Erica but don't talk to us that much anymore even though we met them first and stuff. Sure it may sound childish but I have to admit that sometimes I feel that way also. Especially towards Will Ng. He's someone that I love and look up to. He's always been like a big brother to me and I couldn't help but have felt a pang of jealousy when he told me he went to Swiss Chalet with Erica and Katie after softball and stuff. Ingrid felt the possessiveness towards Jay 'cos it was the "GUMMY BEAR TRIO" who started the whole poking thing and then now Katie and Erica took over again. I mean, Erica even macks on older guys! Being with Sam was really wrong in my opinion but I just kept quiet since she seemed happy with him. I mean, he's 4 years older! Grade 11 guys (Nathan and Wilfred) were already a little extreme for our age, but Sammo?! That was a little crazy.   Speaking of Wilfred, I couldn't help but really think this... I've been hiding this for a long time but I seriously have to admit that I loved him... I did not regret ever being with him and I miss him. He was special to me and he was so different. It's just this strange feeling... I don't know...  sigh...   Well Julie's still on vacation and when she's back I'll still be in Hong Kong. That sucks. Will said that maybe we could do something together sometime this summer but I don't know when. Hopefully we'll really end up doing it and spend some time together.   I'm really disappointed and sad that this happened between Erica and I but I guess all I can do is wait for something to happen and... get over it.

      Here I am, just sitting in front of the computer yet again. I don't really know what I'm going to say in this blog entry but all I know is that my thoughts are just flowing into my fingers as my fingers are flying over the keyboard typing out my every thought. I don't know if I'll hide anything on this blog because I know that I've hidden some things in my public one. What I need right now is guidance. I really don't know what to do. Read Wilfred's blog and thought about what he had to say about the problem I was currently having. She cleary stated for me to stay out of her life. What do you want me to do about it? Why do I have to say I'm sorry when I don't even know why she's so pissed off at me. Is it because of all the stuff she said in her blog? That I lecture her everytime she talks to me about something? Do I really lecture her? I remember just not saying much about certain things! I don't say much when she tells me stuff because I hated how  she  always ended up lecturing me about everything! I turn to her with my problems with Nima and she ends up giving me this whole talk that I really didn't need. Instead of helping me think things out, that shit she said made things worse! It's always annoyed me how she tried to act all "cute" too, but do you see me snapping at that? I hate how she snaps at me but I let it go every time. You never see me snapping at her! She doesn't even know this but she makes me feel so stupid every time she gives me one of her as-a-matter-of-fact comments. I really don't need that stuff but I just took it all in and kept quiet anyway.  Wil pointed out so many places in my old blog about how much I loved my best friend. Yeah, those were all true. It took a lot of troubles, sweat, tears, and of course laughs to get through to now. It wasn't me who told her to get out of my life... she told me to. It'll probably only frustrate her even more if I did anything about that. So what can I do? I can't force my way back into her face because of that.   Yeah, she's always been there for me. She went all the way downtown with me and all the way back up with me and was there when I was doing stuff with Wil. At the Candy Carnival she went outside and walked with me when I wanted to. Yeah, she was there all those times. But what do you want me to do about it? I can't do shit to get her to take back the "get out of my life". It wasn't me who decided to end this, it was her. And if that's what she wanted then that's that.   I know that she gets frustrated with me. I know that I'm not the greatest friend in the world. I'm not perfect... but the fact is: we've both changed into totally different people. From when we first met in grade 4 till now. Five years ago, we were just friends. She knew me as "the girl who beat up Martin" and I knew her as "the milky pens girl". We sat together sometimes in Malin's french class upstairs and drew with her milky pens. In grade 5, we talked more and became best friends. We talked about Eric, Benny, and other stuff. In grade 6, we were still best friends and she was there too when I was with Ronen. In grade 7 last year, she was there when I was with Mike, when I was with Joel, and when I was with Wilfred. Even when I broke up with Wilfred. To be honest, that was one of the hardest things I ever had to do... break up with him. I can honestly say I loved him. What we had was definitely something special and something I could never forget unless I got into a very unfortunate accident where I lose my memories. This year in grade 8, she was there when I was with Nima and through all the good times and the bad. Finally, this happened and is this the end already? I have no idea.   Would it ever be possible that we get back together as best friends again? I have no idea. It could be possible but it also may not happen. I don't know.   Wilfred said that I would probably have too much pride to say sorry and stuff to fix it up and he's probably right. I do have too much pride sometimes to do certain things. I remember back in grade 4, Rachel and I always fought and always hated then loved then hated then loved each other. We were always fighting. We still ended up being pretty good friends. We were, in other words, inseperable. I've always been the one to set away my pride to apologize and she never was able to do that until later. I don't know why I can't do it now. It's just... unexplainable with words.   I skipped church for Wonderland? I wanted to go to church and then go to Wonderland a little later than everybody and meet up with them there but a few people needed rides and couldn't go unless they had a ride there and my mom wouldn't pick them up on the way to church to pick me up so I had to just go with them.   Katie said "its not like u never skipped cd team!". The thing is, it would've worked if she hadn't been there with me. Everybody has. That makes the statement killed. And the thing is, I didn't have anybody there telling me not to skip.   Everybody I talked to told this to me as politely as possibly because they knew that Erica and I were "best friends" and I just kept quiet about what they said. Basically, they said that maybe it wasn't a good idea to bring Erica and Katie to our church. Bringing more people to church is always good but it probably wasn't the right time to yet. All they had ever done at our church was socialize and mack. Erica always complained about Katie and how all she did was mack and go to church for friends. The thing is, she's doing the  exact same thing . She said "o thx joey for bringing me to church and God" and all that shit, but what is that? Shit!   She complained to me that all these guys were hitting on her and asking her out and then she turns around and goes macking right back and leading them on! When they ask her out, she just rejects them and continues flirting. Not healthy in my opinion.  She thought that I was talking behind her back but I wasn't. I was just talking to Katie about why she skipped. I was actually gonna speak to Erica seperately to see what happened. Katie being there for her? Why do you need someone to be there for you when you're on the phone with your man?! Erica's always complained and bitched about Katie this Katie that and then she goes telling me that Katie was there for her? Okay right whatever.  There's just so many thoughts running through my head and I just have no idea as to how I can arrange them yet. I'm not the one who called off this friendship in one day, okay? She did. If that's all this friendship ever meant to her, then I guess it's fine with me that she calls it off in  one day .   ------------------------------  From the movie Stand By Me, the main character said in the end of the movie that he never had friends in his entire life like the ones he had when he was 12. I find that very true... because once we all grow up and change into our own people, the way we look at things and the way we do things are different and it changes the relationships between us.  ------------------------------   Just one more thing I had to say...  I didn't show it but I was actually disappointed and kind of hurt that she told me to get out of her life. I really did care and I sincerely loved her as a best friend. She meant so much to me... and I don't know if she took me seriously but I meant it when I said she meant more to me than even Nima.
