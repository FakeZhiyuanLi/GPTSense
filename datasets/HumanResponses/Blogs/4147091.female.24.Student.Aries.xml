      So, we are all well aquainted with my obsession with track. And we all know its because I ran track, but I also have a smaller but no less important obsession with gymnastics....because I did gymnastics. Towards the very, absolute end of my time in gymnastics, I was being recruited for trampoline, but my track coach wouldn't let me even begin to learn tramp because he felt that I would bust the heck out of my knees and then I wouldn't be able to jump. So I didn't, but I always felt I missed the oppertunity for tramp. Hence my obsession. WEll, today we won silver in womens trampoline with Karen Coleburn. She won bronze in Sydney. And she will no doubt try for a medal in double tramp.

      Track and Field has started at the Olympics. That statement alone should dictate my last week in Newfoundland.  I live in a sad world, but I love sports and anyone who dares to insult that can bite me.  So I leave in a week.  I'm getting use to the idea that I will soon be living in a city that values its beef and country music more than fish and Irish music.  I"m being teased by my friends that I will return in Dec with a thick, 'mainlander' accent.  I find this somewhat funny and amusing. When I was living in Cape Town, I lived with and made friends with many Canadians, all from Ottawa west.  But the whole linguistic divide became very apparent when a Canadian from Victoria moved in towards the end of my stay.  She had a very obvious, flat accent. Mutual friends of ours from Cape Town noticed very early on that we had different accents.  But none of our friends from South Africa had ever heard a 'newfie' accent before so I was not able to elicit from them whether they thought I sounded more 'east coast' than she did.  i personally don't think I sound like a newfie, especially when I've been away from home for any length of time.  but while in South Africa I was constantly asked if I was Irish (from my colouring and hair, but also from my accent).  Even when talking with my Canadian friends, people from South Africa would consider me Irish.  Ah well.  Similar things happened in Ireland, outside Dublin, the Irish thought I was from Dublin.  Inside Dublin, they knew I was from Ireland.  (I can't explain how happy it makes me when people actually know where Newfoundland is and can recognize it)

      I have a brillant mother. Shes managed to throw out my itinerary for my whole way to Calgary (which is including a 5 nigt stopover in Toronto). The woman who proclaims to be organized has haphazardly trashed my itinerary. But this is to be expected, she always trashes things without actually stopping to see if important. Oh my...SHE will be getting me a new one, not me.  So our house is being sold. The market is good and I now have 8 days to say goodbye to a house I"ve lived in for 14 years. I will come home at Christmas and have a new home. And whats even more distrubing is that my parents have decieded that since I"m 24, and I will be 26 when I graduate, they no longer need a house, they are going to get an apt. Small, with a pullout for me when i come to visit. I'm being uncerimoniously kicked out of the nest. Sure, I never really had any true plans on moving back after i graduated, but still, to have my parents come to that conclusion and make arrangments that way.....its very scarey.  Yah, so 8 days. I"m slowly beginning to feel lonely. I don't know anyone is Calgary, I"m leaving my friends, I"m starting a new school, a new life and I"m single. Not that the last one really matters, but it would be nice to have someone to share my owes with. As it is, I"m talking constantly to my best friends, chewing their ear off, so to speak and making a sad attempt to unload through MSN with a friend in South Africa. Now, if I had a sig. other, I would simply unload on them and they, being my better half, would have to endure this long and arduous event in order to stay in good boyfriend standing with me. Its the rule.  Random question of the day: At what age is it too old to dye part of your hair bright purple?

      Whoo knew that three glasses of wine would make me drunk?  I certainly didn't.  three glasses of wine, cheese and dessert.  Who knew I'd have such a headache this morning.  Oh well.  live and learn.  10 days now i think.  I"m still distracted by the Olympics and I'm really happy as Canada has won a bronze in synchro diving.   And I"m realizing...I don't know anyone in Calgary!

      Oh my, I did it again.  Or should I say 'opps, I did it again'?  I was answering an email in my yahoo account and saw an ad for what look like a very cool movie...and dark and evil looking.  but it didn't say its name.  So I proceed to click the button to watch the trailer.  Its the new Exorcist movie.  I've managed to avoid that commerical the past few days, but here I go, making the mistake of following the rabbit down the hole.  I guess I deserved it.  So I"m day three into my olympic coverage.  To quote Nichole Richie...'loves it!'.  I woke up this morning to Beach Volleyball...mens....and womens basketball coverage.  I"m really actually just biding my time until the track and field comes on when I can squeal with delight when I see people that I actually know. It will annoy most people I know, butI will get satisfaction in knowing that I can remember a time when Mike Boswell didnt have cornrolls.  i also wait in vain for the winning height in the high jump to be like 1.80m.  then I will say...'see, I could have won the Olympics'.  Waiting in vain, I tell ya!  So the countdown to Calgary is almost in its final 10 days.  I've been distracted by the Olympics too much to really begin to worry.  I still have so much left to do, technical stuff too, the stuff that you hate doing.  Loan stuff and VISA payments and RSVPing for stuff.  Argh.  All I want to do it pack!  but I am getting excited.  I've been laying in bed at night before I go to sleep wondering about the kinds of people that are going to be in the Center with me and what my supervisor is like (having had a really bad experience with my honours supervisor...evil Leyton!).  I"m sure I"m giving myself an ulcer...

      The word is peloton! the group of cyclists who are in the pack behind the leader. Yes, I"m up and watching the Olympics again. This time I woke a half hour into the fun. But I'm just happy I remembered the word. Especially since its the womens cycling today.  Today is my youngests counsins Christening. I was in Ireland at the last Christening to take place in this family. And the one before that was Katie, the girl I"m 'babysitting'. I remember the party after Katies Christening very clearly, which I find surprising because I was only 9 at the time. However, I won't be attending Isabellas Christening today. I knew about it, yes, but I"m house bound, with my parents with my car and Katies parents with her car. I received a call at 9:30am from my cousin to ask if we were still going. Appearently plans had been made without me to have me and Katie picked up for this little shindig. But its 9:30am! the Christening is at 11am. I"m just waking up, Katies still in REM sleep. Two girls, somewhat concerned with their appearence will take longer than one hour to get ready, its a law of nature........especially since I have NO appropriate clothing to attend. People should really fill me in on things that concern me.

      I'm prepared to admit that I"m addicted to sport.  Any sport really.  I was fortunate to have spent my ENTIRE teen years competing at a somwhat high National level in Track and Field.  Now that injury and well, university, have pulled me away from the one thing that provided me with absolute joy, I have become an armchair athlete (and occasional runner).  So I spend the last 2 weeks on my time in Newfoundland watching the greatest sporting event in the world, the Olympics.  I was up at 8:30am to watch the beginning of the morning session os CBC's broadcast and even though it was cycling and beach volleyball, I sat rivitted to the tv screen.  I learned today that the 'group' of followers in a cycling roadrace is called the...crap I"ve forgotten already.  But 10 minutes ago I swear I knew it.  I learned that this year in Beach Volleyball there is no side out...very different from the volleyball I played in high school.  And the very fact that the number 2 in the Canadian womens team is 5'5, gives me hope at 5'6 that I am not short.  But i think we have lost the Olympic spirit.  None of my friends really care the its on.  And they have resigned themselves to the fact that I will be a hermit for the next 2 weeks.  Even those people that I feel should, at the very academic level understand and appreciate the Olympics, do not.  Like my Classics minor friend, who also majored in Philosophy...pre-Decartes philosophy.  Even I, who took only one Classics course in my undergrad, and it being the intro to greek civilization, can appreciate the history of the games.  but alas, I stand alone, curled up in front of my tv, cheering on the Canadian team.  I also feel the need to inform everyone that the first commerical I saw this morning, at 8:30am was a commerical for the new Exorcist movie.  I was so doe eyed that I didn't realize waht it was at first...and ofcourse CBC weren't going to broadcast such a commerical at 8:30am on a Saturday morning! But they did and I gave a little yelp and changed the channel.  Oh boy, its going to be a long Olympics!

      Well, I've been elected to 'babysit' my cousin till Tuesday.  Since she is 15, its not really babysitting.  Its more like making sure she don't burn the house down.  I love the child, but she really is liable to do that.  I brought my laptop with me (cause although they have a computer with internet, it sucks).  Once I got here, i noticed that someone in the houses adjacent has a wireless connection and I can pick up on their signal.  Depending on where i am.  so i ran around the house trying desperatly to get the signal.  But the only time I got it, it was actually too weak for me to do anything.  Sucks eh?  Well, probably not since I"m not actually suspose to be stealing signal...  I've just watched the opening cerimonies of the Olympics.  Very interesting since the order of the countries depends on the host countries own alphabet.  And Canada, being something like K - triangle - N - triangle - D - triangle...or something like that.  So we ended up marching after the States this year.  Not that i really care, but I thought it was an interested dynamic.  So I was up at the summer home last night with my friend.  It was relaxing and actually a pretty good time full of drinking vodka with my parents.  Who knew three or four years ago that I would be sitting around a fire, drinking and having a good time with my parents.  But true story.  Times theyt are a changing..

      Alright, so I"m off to the 'summer home' for a night with a friend.  My parents are already up there and I just need a night out of the city.    How we will get there is beyond me as neither of us is any god at directions.  We will probably get as far as Hr. Grace and start asking for directions to New Perlican.  Townies, they don't know nothing!  I"m still a little sick, but I am no beginning to think of this 'illness' as a bell curve.  I"m back to where I was about 4 days ago.  So this must mean that in a day or two it will be gone.  or I"ll be dead.  Whichever, the pain will be over soon.  Ok, so I"m off.  This will either be a huge pain in the ass for me and Kathy, or it will be a great time full of a whole family of drunkards.  Who knows?

      I've managed to become somewhat involved in a research oppertunity without having any knowledge of what the research would entail. That would be my 'look before you leap' quality shining through. However, I"ve managed to submit a resume to be a lead researcher for the upcoming SSCR conferance on the proposed restructuring of the Native reserves. Have I any interest in native issues? Not really. But i applied thinking that this might be a good way to get my foot in the door and introduce myself to the NRC as a competent researcher. However, I think back to my entire knowledge base of native issues and all I can think of is Five-Wing Goose Bay. I somewho doubt that will be a leading research topic. But I digress...money is money and experience is worth a million bucks.  However, what prompted me to post again today was a story just recently on The National. Darfur, Sudan. Yes, we all can picture the starving children, left motherless by the Sudanese rebels fight the Islamic government. Yes, we cringe at the staggering amount of women who are being raped during this 'genocide'. But sadly, what interests me is the hesitation of the labelling of this situation as a 'genocide'. I fully understand the reprecussions of the UN announcing the offical term genocide in Darfur. Chapter 7 (?) peace keeping missions and all that bull. But do we have to remain blind to the horrific acts of violence and horrid rape of humanity that occured just 10 years ago in Rwanda? Will we let Kofi Annan follow in the footsteps of the incompetent leaders that have come before him? Or will we 'outsource' the policing of the Darfur, only to make the area a protectorate of some other country? We should take a page out of R. Dallaire's book (not literally, having not read it yet) and shout at the top of our lungs, go crazy with the maddness of it all until the UN is faced with the reality of the situation. It will come to a chapter whatever peace keeping mission. Whether is comes to that now or in two months or in a year should not be a concern. What should be OUR concern is that we make it happen now.  What struck me as most humourous in this report this evening was the interview of a very clever academic with the Kennedy Center for Government at Harvard. She suggested that we call in those most emotionally equipped to deal with the 'problem' being created in Darfur, those unlikely Rwandians, who are truly the only people who can imagine such acts. Who better to fight the growing genocide than those who have experienced it first hand? Was it not the Congolise who were called in as a front line in Rwanda to help our dear R. Dallaire in Rwanda. The same Congolise who has suffered similar, yet different fates in thier own country? And as backup? This woman suggested that 'uncontroversial' countries such as Canada (a known powerhouse in peacekeeping...[Somalia anyone?]), Australia, South Africa (I shutter to consider who would have been in their place 10 years ago) should be the ones to clean up the mess made. At least shes honest about her own countries dangerous laisons. Do we really see a future in Darfur without the U.S.? I can only hope so. But I continue to digress...  Maybe we should 'outsource' the peacekeeping before we demand that the UN do what they were created for. Would Woodrow Wilson be turning in his grave? I doubt, but he probably didn't foresee a UN that would hide behind legal and linguistical technicalities either. But alas here we are, attempting to force the hand of the organization that was created to protect it.  But I should not have to digress again.

      So apparently, I"m not the plague child of Newfoundland.  Last night, after I had consigned myself to yet another night of tv watching while feeling bad for my sick self, I receive a call from friends - independently.  And all of a sudden my germ infested house is party central.  Well, not really, but there was more than one body in my house for several hours last night.    We laughed, we cried till the wee hours when I kicked them all out for making fun of my complete disregard for my exboyfriends feelings.  Was that wrong?  I don't think so....hell, it was 3am.  Am i feeling any better today?  Nope.  I feel just as crappy as yesterday, although I"m going to the doctor today.  Not for this flu that I"ve seem to catch, but for some unrelated girly thing that 'has to be done' as some people put it.  But while I"m there, I"m most definatly going to bring up that I"m sick.  Who knows, maybe there is a cure for the common cold?  Last night brought about some truly interested questions that have spawned a little self analysis.  I am, unchallenaged, the most superficial person most of my friends know.  I realized that years ago and I"ve embraced it.  But last night I began to think long and hard at the men in my life, or men who have been in my life.  For all my superficial qualities, I certainly don't pick the models.  Not that I"m the modelling attracting type.  But I"m beginning to think my label as superfical is somewhat un-called for.  I would have to re-label me as random, as all the men I"ve dated have NOTHING in common, physically or personality wise.  So, I"m going to interrupt my well-meaning friends from now on and replace their label of superfical with random.  (I think it will last roughly 10 minutes before I"m off chasing the cute bass player in the Trews again).

      So for the past, oh...hour and a half, I"ve been attmpting to take a very crash course in HTML and add the Blogroll to the site.  This ain't happening.  And I"m frustrated as hell.  I like to think of myself as smarter than the average bear when it comes to computers, however, appearently the average bear must be illerate and cannot find the on button on a computer.  I follow all directions, generate a code, copy and paste said code and with some minor tweeking (which as far as i was concerned I shouldn't have had to do) I get my blog to say 'Blogroll me!'.  yippie.  nope.  When you press said link, nothing happens.  So after tweeking it more, deleating some "'s adding some "'s, I finally gave up and decieded I"m going to marry the next man who can read html. Any takers?  So that is why the link section on my sidebar is empty.  I want it to say Blogroll me!, but I can't so I refuse to add any other links there, which I"m sure would be much easier than the aforementioned Blogroll me!

      I awoke this morning feeling so much better than I have in days.  But I sound funny.  I'm extreamly congested.  A relative called me this morning to see how I was and didn't recognize my voice on the phone.  Oh well, i was never that big of a fan of my healthy voice anyway.  So, where are we on the great countdown? 17 days I think.  I'm getting more and more excited, obviously.  But I wish I could fast forward to the part where I move in to my new apt.  I"m stoked about visiting friends in Toronto on the way up, but I"m slightly less excited about staying with a quasi relative for 5 nights after I arrive in Toronto.  I"m sure an amature psychologist could easily see its one of those social interaction things I have so much trouble with, but I"m just going to put it down to the fact that I haven't seen this quasi Aunt of mine since I was probably 11.  I will be disrupting her life for 5 nights, and on top of it, she is moving into a new house at the exact same time I will be there.  Stupid University of Calgary policy on not be able to move into apt res until Sept. 6th.  Argh.  But there really isn't anything I can do about it.  Hopefully I'll be too busy to spend any time under her feet.  I"ve got zoos to visit, books to buy, jobs to find.  How much free time can I actually have?   So, I've decieded to visit my folks at the summer home for a night on Thursday with a friend.  I'm very much a city person, but hell, even I need 24 hours of relative silence once and again.  Thankfully I'm not driving the hour or so it will take to get us there.  Although I"m the first to admit I don't have the greatest confidence in my friends driving either.  She may not have hit a house like me, but she has a bad habit of backing into things.  Oh, and surprise, surprise, I did see that cursed commerical after last night.  Thankfully, I recognized what it was before I was too tramatized.  Random question for today: do opposites really attract?

      How boring can my life be that I"m posting twice in one day?  What you should be asking yourself is how contagious am I that I"m posting twice in one day.  Very.  Apparently.  Yes, I"m still sick, but being home alone, sick has made me realize a few things that also make me laugh.  Go figure.  I have discovered my hatred of caller ID.  Since my parental units are not within shouting distance, I am now refusing to answer the phone if I know its not for me.  This is disturbing, as I realize I've become one of THOSE people.  Before you know it, I"ll have an answering machine and I won't be answering until the person on the other end starts saying..'Rian, i know your home...pick up Rian...'.  How rude!  Also, I've realized for probably only the second time in my life, that I lead with my heart.  Within the past 12 hours, I've spilt my heart (well, not my heart, but my true emotional feelings) and I've been burned....again.  Although the again is not necessarily referring to the same person.  I"m not stupid to spill twice and get burned.  And as always, I say i will be more careful with who I trust with my true feelings.  However, I know that in a month, or a year, I"ll be back here saying the same thing. Maybe its true what people say....what is it that people say?  I dunno.  And I don't care.  I"m becoming jaded. Bite me world of indifference!  However, I have gone through the day without seeing that damned Exorcist: The Prequel commerical.  The day might not be over, but I"m fairly confidant that i won't see it.  So I"m considering this a good day.   Random thought for the day: Why did they replace Belle Black three times in two weeks?  Or more importantly, how many Floridian's will it take to relect G. W. Bush, Jr?

      I'm beginning to think I"m going to have a very unproductive 10 days. I"m still not all that well, and it doesn't look like I"m going to be clearing up too soon. I did miss the Folk Festival that I so desperatly wanted to go and I heard it was a blast. So I feel poorly on a bunch of different fronts. But, we all need to get sick, and I"d rather mine now, when I"m of no burden to anyone...  So I think its like 19 days till I leave. Not only am I excited, but I"m truly looking forward to starting school again. Theres something for me about learning, about drawing ideas and being in a atmosphere where everyone is there for the same reason that inspires me to do my best. The only thing that I am trepadacious about is not knowing anyone. Academics I can handle, social interaction...that scares me. I have a few quasi relatives in Calgary and one friend I haven't seen in ages. Something that has been going through my mind for the past several months is when someone I knew, only through being in the same seminar class with him, proclaimed that I'm an introvert. I had always thought of myself as an extrovert. My whole life. But shortly after he said that I was forced to take a personailty test, and it was reconfirmed that I am indeed an intorvert. I fight against this label, all the time, but its now plain to see, especially in the area od social interaction, that I am an introvert. Evertime I move somewhere (Dublin, Cape Town, Calgary), I"m faced with the realization that I have a hard time meeting other people. Eeep. the very thought again is making me ill. I"m sure I'm giving myself an ulcer....

      I'm feeling slightly better today. I took random stuff to help eliminate the pounding head last night and although I think I drifted in and out of reality because of it, I think it is solely responsible for me feeling somewhat better today. But not compleatly. I still feel like a horse is sitting on my chest.  I was asked a bunch of very though provoking questions yesterday by a friend who felt the need to make sure I hadn't died. God love her. After answering them and thinking about them for most of last night, I think they are something that I should share here, it truly gets the mind thinking...   what do you see as total satisification?  I honestly believe doing something I love would enable me to be compleatly satisified for once. Unlike many people, I don't see a sig. other as total satisifaction (having just come out of a very long term relationship, I might be somewhat jaded). For me, something i love woul be working in a development NGO, hopefully in Africa, but barring that in Northern Ireland. Either a) Africa: working for democracy and economic development or b) Northern Ireland: working towards conflict resolution within already negoiated peace settlements. Corney and strange, eh?  Where were you and at what moment in your life were you the happiest?  Ok, I think I have a few. But most recently, I knew I would be ok and I would live (and love again) when I broke up with my last boyfriend. Also, when I was in hot safari truck in Swaziland, slowly climbing up with hills to the capital, watching pastorial life unfold before my eyes. And probably the night I went for a walk in Dalkey, Co. Dublin. Looking at the stars and realizing that everyone I cared about was looking at the same stars as well.  What is the your principal character trait?  Independence  And which trait are you the least proud of?  The fact that I have a very hard time trusting people.  The quality that you prefer in a man?  This changes for me as I meet new people who bring new elements into my life. But right now, its honesty.  Your greatest fear?  My greatest fear is spiders and death.  What is your most valuable possession?  My sanity at all times. But material, I'd probably have to say my education (is that really material?).  In what have you succeeded the most in your life?  I'd like to think, with my height working against me, I was a pretty good high jumper. And although I"m by far not the sharpest pencil in the box, I have received my BA and I am about to do my Masters. But I think I've succeed the most at doing what I want.  Your favorite painters?  I'll let you in on a very little secret. I love art. I recently went to the South African Museum of modern art, all by myself and got wrapped up there for HOURS! Not too many people know that. But my favourite artist is S. Dail and my best friend Nadine.  Your favorite composers?  Greig  The words that you like?  Depends in the language I"m speaking, but in English, I really enjoy 'as well', 'duck', 'billiant', 'fantastic' and 'superb'. In french I enjoy (way too much) 'savior faire'.  Your favorite cult work?  Probably the white wolf fiction, preferably Masqurade (and yes, I can't spell to save my life).  Your favorite authors?  Anne Rice, Rian Milan and most definatly NOT Foucault.  The book you keep by your bedside?  Its always changing. But presently, its my journal and 'South African Apartheid: A Guide to the Everyday Racial policies in South Africa'.  The song that you often whistle?  I hate whistlers.  Your favorite color?  Green and purple. Although not together.  Your favorite drink?  Pepsi.  Your drug?  Who knows what I"ll be addicted to after one semester of grad school!  Your heroes in life?  I don't want to follow someone elses path and in my view, thats what a hero is. I admire people, but I really don't have any heros.  If you could change one thing about your physical appearance?  Don't get me started. Perfect skin would be great...right now I want longer hair..I could so go on.  The faults that you take the greatest pleasure in?  I truly enjoy not having that little voice in my head that tells me something is a bad idea. Like going to South Africa. That was clearly a BAD career move. I did not expand my academic abilities, although I did somehow pick up on economics and trade fairly quickly (making me wonder if I will someday go back to school to get a degree in economics). I postponed going to grad school by a full year, even two I think. I had emotional well being changed by two people specifically. However, I DID cement my life focus and meet some of the most amazing people in the whole world. I LOVE the absence of that little voice.  Your greatest regret?  Hum...I have always said my whole life that I don't have regrets. There are things I wish I hadn't chosen to do, but I hardly classifiy them as regrets as I usually see the benefit of doing them afterwards.  What do you hate above all?  Manipulation.  How would you like to die?  Quickly. And without warning.  Your current state of mind?  Lonely. Both in a factual point of view and in a emotional point of view.  Your motto?  Say it.

      I've said goodbye to my folks for 10 days.  Yes, they deciede to take a little vacation a mere 3 weeks before I go.  But thats ok, I need a little 'alone in St. John's' time myself.  However, I woke up sick.  And I"m a sucker for being taken care of when I"m sick.  And theres no one to take care of me.  Although my best friend did offer to take me to the emergency room.  Ahh...no.  Sitting in a noisy hospital room waiting to be told I have the flu is not my kind of way to spend a Saturday.  I"ll veg and reminse about all the times I've been sick while living alone before.  And survived.  Although I'd almost give my leg arm to have my exboyfriend here now to take care of me.  He diligently woke me every 4 hours while I was living in Dublin to make me drink water and to make sure I hadn't developed some rare Irish sickness.  I had never been so sick in my whole life.  And I am eternally grateful to him for helping me.  I"m sure I would have accepted a marriage proposal after that.  But I digress...  I busted out and bought the dvd to the 46664 concert I went to in Cape Town last Nov.  I"ve never spent so much on a single dvd.  And the worst part, i can't find myself!  Not that we had the greatest view.  But somewhere in the back of my mind I was sure that I was on it...somewhere and Bono would see it and hunt me down...wait....I"m getting carried away...nonethelsss, I didn't see myself or the other 6 Canadians I went with.  And I must mention my deep unhappiness with the new commerical for the prequeal to the Exorcist.  I probably don't need to explain what an absolutly frightening movie the original is.  And this new one, although seems much less on the scarey side, is conjuring up a bunch of unpleasant images that I must deal with....here...alone.  I saw one at 10am!  Who puts that commerical on at 10am?  Little children are watching that!  Are we trying to push the next generation over the edge and into oblivion?  Or maybe the rest of the world doesn't find it as frightening as I do.  So I sit here on this oddly sunny Saturday afternoon awaiting a promising thunder and lightening storm.  I get cheated by mother nature everytime we have a storm.  I"m usually asleep and I miss it.  However, I'm determined to sit alone and watch it this time.  I find storms an oddly spiritual event (being so very non spiritual myself).  The electricity in the air clears me and recharges my batteries.

      I've been fortunate enough to have my parents pay for my tickets to and from Calgary while I"m doing my Masters.  Well, they are buying the tickets with their aeroplan points, I should say.  I"m greatful, don't get me wrong.  I am however, very pissed at Aeroplan.  Its August, early August and I cannot find a seat out of Newfoundland to Calgary from Jan. 1 till Jan. 14.  I can't arrive that late.  So, with 40,000 points in hand, my parents have bought me a business seat out on Jan. 8th.  I'm so royally pissed because Newfoundland once again gets a raw deal. There are only 4 seats per selected flight out of Newfoundland dedicated to Aeorplan members.  Now, if I REALLY, REALLY wanted to get out, for an extra 12,500 points Aeroplan would MAKE seats available (not in this case, even THOSE slimy seats were taken). This small number of seats out of Newfoundland is appalling!  If I lived anywhere else in Canada, there would be twice or three times the number!  However, no one really ever complains and like everything else in Newfoundland, it will go on unchallenaged.  But I would like to state, that I"m pissed!   And since I"m on the wagon of complaining, I would like to state that for the millionth morning in a row, I"ve been woken up at 9am by construction going on outside my window.  My basic problem isn't with the construction going on outisde my window, its the total lack of disregard for the citizens of St. John's that seems to have permeated EVERY construction company here.  They tear up streets at 2pm in the afternoon, they cause lineups miles long, they take their lunch breaks at the height of traffic.  Now, I'd like to suggest that St. John's city council take a page out of Dublin's book.  When I was living there in 2002-03, there was MAJOR construction on both the Spire (what a waste of Dublins money!) and the new tram system (specifically in St. Stephens Green).  Did construction take place during the normal 9 to 5pm hours?  No usually.  Most of the work took place after work hours, so as to cause as little disruption as possible to the citizens of Dublin.  I"m sure most major citys employ this strategy to deal with difficult construction.  But not St. John's.  Hell, block people out of their homes.  Who cares?  Their only citizens of St. John's....they only pay taxes.  Grrr...  On a much brighter note, Jason Greeley has passed into the Top 7 of Canadian idol.  Good old home town boy from Upper Island Cove (I won't pass judgement on a certain politian from there....even if he is a LIBREAL).  I"ve fallen in love with the young boy (hes 18, gezzz, I"m getting old) from Medicine Hat, AB.  Can't remember his name, but hes a charmer.  And a good singer.  Why do I watch this show, apart from supporting Jason?  I really don't know.  Maybe I like to think that I could do what they are doing, be a better singer...Ha!  Or maybe I just want to see the girl with the glasses get out (cause she ain't special) or once again see Ben Mulroney put on some flashy leather dudes and outdo his father in the public speaking category.  Or maybe I should just get out of the house more?

      And I"m off. In 22 days. To Calgary. Leaving home once again. Gezz...I give almost anything to have a permanment residence. AllI really want to do is have a magizine subscription. You know, the one where your required by the law of magazine laws to stay put for something like two years. This is all I ask. Oh, this and to be eternally happy doing something I love. But thats it. For now.  But on to more immediate matters. This weekend is the Folk Festival. I didn't go last year and I feel poorly about having not supported my local music scene. But I will go this year, come hell or high water (which might happen in this port city). And I promise not to embaress my best friend in front of Hawksley Workman (this time), as long as she promises not to embaress me in front of the cute bass player from the Trews. This time. I think its a fair deal.  Does anyone else feel that the upcoming U.S. election is overshadowing the more important matter that we have the devil as PM?  And did anyone see the Oprah where she talks about her time in South Africa (I realize she talks about it more than once). I"m passivly watching this one right now and I"m realizing that I was in Cape Town the same time she was there. Not that it would have mattered had I known at the time...but its a 'humph' moment for me...an 'I didn't know that' moment.
