      Blog Entry 11:38am Sunday May 30, 2004  Last night, after Christie made dinner, Katie, Sara, Christie and I went over to the plaza to spend the night people watching.  Everything was going well until some drunk ass came over and said that I had his beer and tried to take it from me.  We successfully avoided a confrontation.  His more coherent friends communicated to him that they were actually holding his bottle for him.  The guy was a moron, obviously.  But, I wasn’t too worried about anything.  Most fights end in the first minute and there were over a half dozen bicycle cops cruising around the plaza.  The guy probably would have had a bottle or two cracked on his head and I’d be explaining things to the cops.  It wouldn’t have been pretty.  That’s why I’m glad his friends had more of a brain than he did.    There’s a fly creeping around my apartment.    So no one emailed me back except for my mom.  Thanks guys.  If you send me an email, then I will respond.    A group went to Europapark or Euroland today.  I can’t remember the name.  We drove by it on the way to Freiburg.  It looked sort of lame.  I was reminded of Thunder Island which was a water park up in Westfield, IN.  They tore it down sometime when I was in junior high, I think.  Who knows, maybe it will be fun?  I’m sure that there will be some great stories considering Ted organized the jaunt.  He rented a Renault for €94.  I’ll try to find the link to the Euroland park.  I looked at it before I left for Strasbourg.  They have a miniature Europe.  It has all of the major architectural sights miniaturized.  It did look like they had a decent roller coaster.    In honor of the really tall girls with too much junk in the trunk here, I’ll leave you with these lyrics.    You’ve Got An Ugly and Stupid Butt by Strongbad  You’ve got an ugly butt and a stupid butt, Ohh Oh girl, you’ve got an ugly butt, hey Oh girl, you’ve got a stupid butt, ooh Let me go, you’ve got a ugly butt, uh Everybody got a stupid butt, hey Oh girl, ugly butt, uh Ooh, stupid butt, uh White girl, you’ve got an ugly butt, ooh Everybody got a stupid butt, uh   The Ladies in Town All Know My Name by Strongbad  I am fairly great And the ladies in my town all know my name Except for this one girl She thinks my name’s Brian  The Theme From Dangeresque II: This Time It’s Not Dangeresque I by Strongbad  So dangerous, So dangerous He fights the law, but he also fights the crime, but not as much Dangeresque With Renaldo at his side, he’ll have Renaldo at his side Dangeresque (Dangeresque) He’s got some Chinese stars, and he keeps them under the bed with a length of pipe Dangeresque (lenth of pipe)  The guy is dangeresque The mighty oak has fallen If movies have taught me anything, he’ll get the girl (or maybe not)  Stick it to the man, Stick it to the man (hoo, hoo) Cool glasses, cool glasses Stick it to the man, Stick to the man (hoo, hoo) Cool, cool, glasses  He works alone, except for when he works with Renaldo, which is all the time Dangeresque He’s a private eye, a crooked cop, secret agent and a celebrity pharmacist Dangeresque  That guy is dangeresque, dangeresque, dangeresque, dangeresque Or did I

      I apologize for the long post.  As you'll see, these are actually a few posts in one since I don't have the best internet access over here.   Blog entry 11:35pm Thursday May 27, 2004  Today we went to Luxembourg.  Being the genius that I am, I told everyone that I would call them to wake them up in the morning.  That didn’t happen.  I got a call from Katie at 5:30am telling me to wake up.  We had to be on the bus at 5:45am.  So, I didn’t shower.  All of my clothes are dirty.  I made it on the bus.  We went to Luxembourg (2.5 hours by bus) and visited the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors.  We sat in on a case about waste removal.  It was actually interesting.  We got to see a case argued in front of the Court of Justice.  After that (8 hours later) Katie, Sara, Christie, Chris and I walked through the gorge surrounding Luxembourg City.  That’s when the bird crapped on me.  Not only was I sweaty, unshowered and wearing dirty clothes, but a bird had now crapped on me.  I found out later that I’m number 4 (not number 2, get it?) on the trip to get crapped on by a bird.    We climbed back up to Luxembourg City and went to Sparky’s (formerly an Irish pub, but now run by some Ukrainians).  I met some refugee from Kosovo there.  He and I talked while Katie, Christie, Sara and Chris hung out.  On the way back to the bus I made a bet that I could do 20 pull-ups.  Sara and I agreed on the kind of pull up with your hands to the front.  I lost the bet, but I still won.  I found a place on a bus stop to do them.  I did 10.  I got on the bus and another girl bet me that she could do 10.  At that point, Sara got in on it.  Both of them couldn’t do more than 2.  I won.    I finally got a decent glass of wine.  Sara got us a Cabernet.  It was the first red wine that I’d had here.  It was much better than all of these uber-sweet white wines they have in Alsace-Lorraine.    Tomorrow we have 4 hours of class starting at 10am.  After that I have no idea what’s going on.    I’ll leave you now with the lyrics to a song I’ve been listening to quite a bit.  Enjoy.  Growing Up by Bruce Springsteen  Well, I stood stoned-like at midnight Suspended in my masquerade I combed my hair ‘til it was just right And commanded the night brigade  I was open to pain And crossed by the rain And I walked on a crooked crutch Well, I strolled all along  To a fallout zone And came out with my soul untouched  I hid in the cloud It ran for the crowd They said sit down  I stood up Ohh, growin’ up  Well, the flag of piracy flew from my mast My sails were set wing to wing I had a jukebox graduate For a first mate She couldn’t sail  But she sure could sing  I pushed B-52 and bombed them with the blues With my gears set stubborn on standing We broke all the rules  And I strafed my old high school Never once gave thought to landin’  I stood in the cloud  And it wondered the crowd And when they said come down I flew up Ohh, growin’ up  I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere And you know it’s really hard to hold your breath I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was a cosmic heading for a costume dress  Well, my feet, they finally took root in the earth But I got me a nice little place in the stars And I swear I found the key to the universe  In the engine of an old parked car  I hid in the mothered breast of the crowd But, when they said pull down  I pulled up Ohh, growin’ up   Blog Entry 12:15pm Friday May 28, 2004  Today, after class, I’ll eat at the student cafeteria with Ted and maybe some others.  The food is really not that bad for €2.50.  It’s sort of like homestyle French food.  They have lunchladies in white outfits.    At 3pm, Katie, Sara, Christie and I are riding down to Freiburg with Professor Emmert.    The weather is perfect today.  Class should be over in about 45 minutes.  Christie and I hauled it to class this morning.  We’ve managed to shave about 10-12 minutes off the walk by finding a route through town rather than following the tramline.  I don’t like taking the tram to class because it costs €1.20 each way.  Why pay almost $1. 50 when I can take a 25 minute walk?  Yeah, I’m a little sweaty when I sit down in class.    I’ll have to figure out a way to get the poop out of my shirt and wash my clothes.  I doubt it will happen today.  I have the feeling that we won’t be getting back from Freiburg until late tonight.  There is an H&M in Freiburg.  Maybe I’ll just buy a new shirt there.    I was the tour guide yesterday in Luxembourg.  I have the feeling that I’ll be doing the same today.  I plan on showing everyone the cathedral and walking up the small mountain to get a great view of the city.  We’ll probably walk up and down the river too.  I hope I can find one of the restaurants I ate at there a couple of years ago.  There was one that had this weird pizza-type thing that was really good that I hope I can find.    Nick, and anyone else who listens to Kraftwerk, will know what I’m talking about.  My prof (who is German) just said “Pocket Calculator.”  He said it exactly like Kraftwerk says it.  “I’m the operator with my pocket calculator…..beep…..bop……boing.”  I’d like to take my prof to do Karaoke and get him to sing a Kraftwerk song.  I’d laugh and laugh and laugh.    I’ll leave you with some more lyrics from one of the songs I’ve been listening to quite a bit.  Later  Playing Bogart by Any Trouble  Well, I’ve watched you from my window For a week or month or more Til I heard from an old acquaintance  That my chance had come  He said it ain’t the kind of party  Where they kick you out the door   And they leave you in the gutter Can’t remember what you’d done  Traffic piles up in the city Weekend lurches into gear Got that Friday, seven-thirty feeling in my bones  If you lose playing bogart You’re better on your own Good time people make excuses on their telephones  Give me something for the man who Doesn’t have to try too hard Spend a little time rehearsing my Tom Petty leer  Well, I’m dressed up for my conquest Come out fighting no hold’s barred And I pray for courage and some halfway decent beer  Traffic piles up in the city Weekend lurches into gear Got that Friday, seven-thirty feeling in my bones  If you lose playing bogart You’re better on your own Good time people make excuses on their telephones  Half an ear for conversation Would you like the same again My eyes are red from smoke My legs are going lame  I see those other guys around her Hear their laughter, think again Why does this teenage romance make the jaded singles game  Let me out into the nighttime  Traffic returning home All my two separates??? I walk back slowly through the park  If you lose playing bogart You’re better on your own Sit on my bed and smoke a single cigarette in the dark   Blog Entry 12:35am Saturday May 29, 2004  This afternoon, Katie, Sara, Christie and I hitched a ride with Professor Emmert to Freiburg.  We took the “autobahn” there.  We only spent a few hours there and most of that time consisted of shopping.  I bought a couple of shirts at the H&M there.  We’re going back on another weekend though.  We want to go hiking, but we’d also like to go and shop again.  The food and clothing prices were much cheaper than Strasbourg.  Also, we found the food to be much more enjoyable than in Strasbourg.    I had some absinth.  It was horrible.  I think it might be the worst liquor that I’ve ever tasted.    I’ll have to ask Professor Emmert before I buy any wine.  I’ve had horrible luck so far, and he seems to know which ones are good.    We took the “autobahn” back to Strasbourg.  I think we got up to 200km/h at one point.  I’m not sure how fast that was, but I’ll convert it to mph later.  I did see a full-sized Dodge pickup and a 1965 Ford Mustang on the “autobahn.”    Freiburg was really great.  I had been there 2 years ago under different circumstances.  It hasn’t changed much.  There’s a Burger King there that I didn’t remember.  We’re definitely going back.  There’s much more to see and do.     In honor of my trip to Germany today, I’ll leave you with some lyrics from one of my favorite German music groups, Kraftwerk.  You may think I’m kidding, but I’m not.  I really do like Kraftwerk.  Enjoy.  Computer World by Kraftwerk  Interpol und Deutsche Bank, FBI und Scotland Yard Interpol und Deutsche Bank, FBI und Scotland Yard  Computer Verld Computer Verld  Interpol und Deutsche Bank, FBI und Scotland Yard Interpol und Deutsche Bank, FBI und Scotland Yard  Business, numbers, money, people Business, numbers, money, people  Computer Verld Computer Verld  Interpol und Deutsche Bank, FBI und Scotland Yard Interpol und Deutsche Bank, FBI und Scotland Yard  Time, travel, communication, entertainment Time, travel, communication, entertainment  Computer Verld Computer Verld  Ok, just for fun I’ll post the lyrics to my favorite Kraftwerk song.  I posted earlier about how amusing it was for me when Professor Emmert said “Pocket Calculator” in class.  He said it just how they say it in this song.  Enjoy.  Pocket Calculator by Kraftwerk  I’m the operator wit my pahket calculatah I’m the operator wit my pahket calculatah  I am adding And subtracting I’m controlling  And composing  I’m the operator wit my pahket calculatah I’m the operator wit my pahket calculatah  I am adding And subtracting I’m controlling And composing  By pressing down a special key it plays a little melody By pressing down a special key it plays a little melody  I’m the operator wit my pahket calculatah I’m the operator wit my pahket calculatah     Ok, to round out the nerd trifecta I’ll post some lyrics from one of my favorite Devo songs.  Kraftwerk and Devo are both ridiculous bands, but at least Devo doesn’t take themselves half as seriously as Kraftwerk does.      Mongoloid by Devo  Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid Happier than you and me Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid And it determined what he could see Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid One chromosome too many Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid And it determined what he could see  And he wore a hat  And he had a job And he brought home the bacon so that no one knew  He was a mongoloid, mongoloid His friends were unaware Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid Nobody even cared Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid One chromosome too many Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid And it determined what he could see  And he wore a hat And he had a job And he brought home the bacon so that no one knew  He was a mongoloid, mongoloid Happier than you and me Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid And it determined what he could see Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid One chromosome too many Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid And it determined what he could see  And he wore a hat And he had a job And he brought home the bacon so that no one knew  He was a mongoloid, mongoloid

      Ok, so my first round of pictures are up on  urlLink Sarbinoff.com .  Today I spent some time learning how to make movies.  I have mastered my impression of Professor Emmert.  I think he has a sense of humor.  So, soon I'll have some Quicktime movies up on sarbinoff.com.  The pictures on the blog are from the first couple of days here.  We went to a winery and a castle.  I know, it sounds rough.  In reality, we've had class for 4 hours almost everyday.  The classes have been mixed with field trips.  Most of our days are full doing schoolwork.  The field trips have been really boring.  We went to the European Court of Human Rights.  We were bunched in with a group of undergrads from American University in Washington.  They asked the dumbest questions.  For example, one kid asked if retards and kids can file claims in that court.  Another guy asked something about cyber crime.  I guess he didn't see the sign that said "Court of Human Rights" on the front of the building.  The tour guide chick was talking for about an hour about genocide, torture, unjust imprisonment, etc. when that loser asks about cyber crime.    I've seen plenty of "dog" crap on the streets.  K stepped in some already (names will remain anonymous).  I was making coffee in my room and managed to spill it all over my kitchenette.  It made my room smell really bad.  I sang Karaoke at an Irish Pub last night.  It was the worst Karaoke set up I've ever seen.    Right now I'm in an Internet Bar in Strasbourg, France.  This is where my program is set up for the school.  Not in the bar, but in Strasbourg.  I'm listening to Cheap Trick and chilling with Pierre and Stephan the bartenders.    Everyone has been having problems with the showers here.  They keep overflowing.    I've made arrangements to go down to Florence to meet up with Annalisa.  She's a friend of a friend back home.  I'm heading down there on our free weekend after Brussels.    The girls on the trip are trying to get me to buy some "euro clothes."  I don't think I could sport the capris and sleeveless t-shirt.    I really want to get a red balloon and chase it around the city.  I'll take it to class with me and sing French songs.  It's really easy to keep myself entertained over here.    Alright, C just wanted me to tell everyone that she's in the bar right now too.  She's the reason I put those pictures of wedding dresses on the website.  She might buy one here and wanted to show them to her family.    K is drinking some berry-flavored beer.  I've been sticking to the Belgian beers.  The Chimay's and Orval's have been treating me well.  I'm so glad I made it to the beerfest in Bloomington before I came here.  Now I know what I'm ordering.  K bought the worst beer I've ever tasted yesterday.  It was really thick and tasted like it had some kind of syrup in it.    I'll try to write these posts at home when I have more time to tell the stories well.  There have definitely been some amusing moments.  Look forward to posts about my classmates stepping on "les canards."    Oh yeah, the women here are tall with big butts and the guys are short and tiny.  That's all for now.  Take it easy...

      I,m here.  Please pardon the typos.  The keyboard layout is different.  Also, please pardon this post for being boring.  I took some allergy medication and my brain isn,t functioning well.  Sara, Katie, Christie and I are in a cybercafe in Strasbourg;  I,m drinking my Coke Lite.    We,ve had one class so far.  It was 4 hours long.  My sleeping patterns are still messed up.  I didnt sleep the night before.  I could barely stay awake for the class.  Good thing the lecture was the same one our prof gave in my WTO Law class last semester.  We've been done the wine road to a winery and a picturesque village.  I have pictures, but I'm not sure how I'm going to upload them yet.  Give me time.    Our favorite place so far has been an Irish Pub where we've made some friends.  Céline is our guide for the trip.  She's a law student here and tremendously nice and patient with us.    I'll write more later.  I'm still suffering from jetlag, hungover, and tweaked out on my allergy medication.  Au revoir.

      We're off to France tomorrow.  Katie, Sara and I take the rental car up to Chicago to catch our flights.  I fly from Chicago to Manchester and then to Frankfurt.  I'll catch a train into Strasbourg from there.    The two of them are out playing darts and getting drunk right now.  I just got back a concert that Sara enlightened us with.  Some chick who played acoustic guitar and sang about petting fish (I hope you know what that means).  It was a great show.    I'm going to go finish packing.

      I see that Sara and Katie are now on the blog.  If you guys need help figuring out how to post, then I can show you.  We should be able to add pictures to the posts as soon as I figure out where we can put them.    Also, feel free to post whatever you like.  Don't take my first couple of posts as the precedent.

      So, I don't have much to post about yet.  But, I did see a great commercial while I was building this webpage.  It's for the Sybaris.  I put a link to it in the column on the right.  I think we should all have a party there after we get back from France.  I like the "Chalet" room.  We could get it for an afternoon and all pitch in.  It's cheaper by the hour.    Check out the "Gift Collection" if you get a chance.  No comment.

      Gobo, Last night, Christie and I had to find something else to do.  Being cooped up in our rooms for most of the day, we decided to go out for dinner.  We found an Italian place that was really inexpensive.  Three hours later, we looked for a place to get a drink.  We weren't having much luck so I decided to go back to the little courtyard place I went to the night before.  Success!  There were beautiful women and lots of people around.    A large group of old men sat down next to us.  We started talking to them about France and music.  I found a music fan like me.  We talked about the Sex Pistols (in particular, the movie, "The Filth and the Fury"), Blondie, Elvis Costello, Any Trouble, Talking Heads, the Ramones, Squeeze, and the list could go on.  This man and his friend were surprised to find someone my age who listens to the music that they grew up with.    Christie helped out with the French.  The more I drink, the more French I speak.    It ends up that the guy Christie and I were talking to is a lawyer in Strasbourg.  He and his friends were out for a bachelor party.  I can't remember the French word for it, but it had something to do with "burying the boy."  We then went with these guys to Le Salamandre (sp?).  I had my first Apple Juice and Vodka.  It was surprisingly refreshing and good.    Christie and I were invited to go to this lawyer's "cabinet" (French for "law firm").  His friends said he was the best attorney in town.  I know, your friends are supposed to say that.  This guy was a bit of inspiration for me though.  He's probably the coolest attorney I've ever met.  He was out wearing all black with green Chuck Taylor's.  He also had hair like mine.  Awesome.    So, tomorrow, Christie and I are going to call our new friend and go see his law firm.  I plan on burning some CD's for him that I think he would like.  I think I'll burn him some Television and Any Trouble.  I'll probably throw in some Mysteries of Life or the Pieces to expose him to some music made by Hoosiers.    Annalisa comes in tonight.  She called me this morning and woke me up.  It took me a while to realize what was going on.  She needed my address.  I have to finish cleaning up my room, go to the grocery store, and buy some flowers today.    Sincerely, Uncle Traveling Matt

      Christie and I were planning on visiting her friend just outside of Stuttgart today.  We went to the train station to buy tickets, 80 euros.  We aren't going.  Stuttgart is less than 2 hours away.  So much for that great train system that Europe has.  It seems that it's always been much more expensive to take the train than it is to drive.    So, then we decided to find out more about this Miss Kitten show which was supposed to be in Strasbourg.  It took us all morning to find the information we needed.  We had to walk all the way to the Office of Tourism for the address for Club Yalta.  Whoever designed the Club Yalta website forgot to put an address on it.  Brilliant.    It took us all morning to do these two simple things.    Things are looking better now.  I just borrowed a guitar from a guy here on the program.  That will make my day better.  I guess I could study, clean up my room, take a nap, or play the guitar now.  Sounds exciting.    So, I'll just finish my Pepsi Max and Twix bar and get on with better things.

      Talking on IM with an Italian girl who barely speaks English is very difficult.  It's almost as hard as understanding our French professor.    I thought I'd mention that there is free music to download on my webpage.  I put up a bunch of recordings that were made a long time ago.  Some of you might enjoy them.  They're not the greatest quality, but they're listenable.

      I took some photos of Strasbourg tonight.  It doesn't get dark here until really late.  I'll take some more later.  I'll post them either tomorrow or Sunday.  I have to be on a high-speed connection to do it.    Christie and I have decided to stay the night at her friend's house just outside of Stuttgart tomorrow night.

      This weekend is one of our "Free Weekends."  Most of the students on the program went to Interloken in Switzerland this weekend.  Christie and I are planning on visiting one of her friends in Stuttgart on Saturday.  We might come back to catch a show here at a discotheque in Strasbourg.  It doesn't look like we'll make it to the show though.  It appears to be far outside of town and we don't know how much it will cost.    We have finals next week so I'll probably study for them this weekend.  I don't know what to expect.  We've only had a week of 4 hour classes for each of the three finals.  We don't even really have that much time to study for them.  We haven't even started our German Law classes and we have a final over them next week.  What fun.    Annalisa (the italian cutie) is coming to visit me in Strasbourg.  She should be getting here on Sunday night.  That's something to look forward to.    I think I might go out later and take some pictures of Strasbourg.  The weather cleared up here today.  It's been raining.  Katie, Christie and I went on the boat tour of the canals yesterday evening.  There is a lot of Strasbourg that I haven't seen.  Hopefully I'll have some pictures up to share with you all.    Later...

      Today I was buying some groceries and I saw something really disgusting.  A saw a guy pick up a hairbrush off the rack, use it, and put it back up.     Our French teacher has the thickest accent.  I thought she said, "Is there an ear for the diseased."  She really meant to say, "Is there an heir for the deceased."      I'm back in Strasbourg and it's hot.  The women seemed to have quit wearing their bras.  I've also seen a lot more white pants here on the women.  You can see just about everything underneath them.      In My Command—Crowded House  I would love To trouble you in your time of need Lose your way It’s a pleasure when you’re in my command  Put on your wings You’re responsible for everything  In my command In my command  In my command In my command In my command In my command  I’m standing in a deep dark hole Beneath the sky is black as coal It’s just a fear of losing control  You know so well  Missing when the moment comes Be submissive just this once Imagine there is something to learn Some truth to tell  I would love to trouble you in your time of need Lose your way It’s a pleasure when you’re in my command  Brother (?) like a diplomat Struggle to hold onto your hat Swinging like an acrobat But time will tell  (Something) is sleeping on the wall Listen to the rise and fall Close your eyes and hear the call You know so well  I would love to trouble you in your time of need Lose your way It’s a pleasure when you’re in my command  Put on your wings You’re responsible for everything  Destiny and anger It’s safe in isolation You’re about to be a victim of a holy invitation By the rights have been given  Put on your wings You’re responsible for everything I would love to trouble you in your time of need  Lose your way It’s a pleasure when you’re in my command In my command (in my command) In my command (in my command) In my command (in my command)

      Could someone please tell my dad that he´s managed to #$%@ my email up?    I don´t think I´m able to send or receive emails.  I think I know what he did.  He probably set up the mail program on his computer.  Well, it was set up for me.  He needs to change the settings.    Those of you who know me should be able to find out my home phone number.  Call it and tell my dad to pull his technophobe head out of his rearend.    On another note, I´m in Frankfurt waiting for a train back to Strasbourg.  People keep staring at me.  It´s either that they are actually staring or I´m hallucinating because I´m so tired.

      Well, I haven't been posting.  I've been in Brussels, Bruge and now in Florence.  Yeah, I know.  It sounds rough.    I'm leaving for Strasbourg tomorrow night.  It will be hard to leave this place.    That's all for now.  I have better things to do than sit at the computer.
