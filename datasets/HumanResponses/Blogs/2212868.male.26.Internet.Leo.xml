      I picked up a book at the library concerning exercises for beginners to burn calories, and I came across a very nice long-term at-your-own-pace schedule for training for a 10k run.  The schedule also promises to burn calories at a nice clip, which is something I'm going to need help with.  The schedule revolves around "weeks," where it provides a seven day exercise schedule that you are to repeat over and over until you feel comfortable with each day's workout.  After that, you move on to the next "week."  Here's the first week: Goal: To jog 1 mile (1.6 km) without stopping Day 1: 1 mile (1.6 km) walk Day 2: 1 mile (1.6 km) walk and/or jog (begin to mix in jogging) Day 3: 1 mile (1.6 km) walk and/or jog Day 4: Rest Day 5: 1 mile (1.6 km) jog.  Try to jog the entire mile. Day 6: 1 mile jog. Day 7: Rest Repeat until you're comfortable jogging the whole mile.  I will start tomorrow morning with this.  I might also look at a gym tomorrow; there is one available near where I work that is highly recommended by coworkers.

      I currently weigh 313 pounds (roughly 142 kg), which combined with my height of 6 feet, 6 inches (roughly 198 centimeters), gives me a BMI of 36.2, which is  not  good (info on  urlLink BMI ).  My long-term goal is to reach a BMI of 20, which would have me at a weight of 173 lbs.  This would mean I would lose 140 pounds, or almost half of my weight.  To temper this, I have decided that for each 0.5 BMI I lose along the way, I'll reward myself by buying myself a new book.  My primary hobby is reading, and I thoroughly enjoy spending a couple of hours in the evening with a good book.  Along the way, I'm going to measure my weight each week and re-calculate my BMI to see how I'm doing.

      In mid-June, I went on a vacation with my wife.  On this trip, we camped near Mount Rainier and spent part of one of the days hiking on a mountainous trail, which went for about six miles round trip, much of it going either up or downhill (unsurprising near a mountain).  There were parts of the hike that I really enjoyed, but for much of the hike, I was miserable.  Shortly after we returned, we went on a bike ride together.  We rode for about seven miles and, again, at the end of the trip, I was completely exhausted.  I began to worry a lot about my health, so today I went to visit my doctor, and he strongly recommended that I start on a better diet and a reasonable exercise regimen  immediately .  He had a lot of suggestions, which among them included    keeping an exercise / diet / weight management journal, which you're looking at right here  setting very discrete and realistic short term goals for myself, and rewarding myself when I accomplish them  setting a couple discrete long term goals  avoiding an extensive dietary overhaul, but instead just make sure you're getting all of your food groups in proper balance    So, I'm going to give this my best shot.  This is my exercise journal, and I might also post other things here, such as what I'm reading currently, what I'm listening to when I exercise, and so forth.

      We have something of a busy day planned today, but tomorrow I plan on both running and getting in a session at the rec center in the morning.

      This morning, I had a pair of frustrations that have kept me from exercising.  First, my wife wakes me up and states that we're going to a parade in the morning, which wouldn't have been an issue... except that the gym closes at noon for the holiday.  Second, it's now raining outside so I can't jog.  What a bummer.

      I woke up this morning with seemingly every muscle in my body sore, from my shoulders to my ankles.  I decided to rest today and not even run, but I'm going to go to the rec center in the morning for a nice workout.

      I went to the Lied Recreation Center and was quite impressed with the facilities.  I got a little bit overzealous (for lack of a better word), put on some workout clothes, and tried out pretty much every machine in the place for a bit.  I found several that really seemed to get the sweat going, which is my goal right now rather than focusing on specific muscle groups.  I am worried that I am going to wake up in the morning and be very sore; I may have overdid things for the first day.

      On my way into work, I stopped at the local grocery and picked up some bottles of  urlLink Naked juice  to drink for breakfast and lunch.  As a main entree for lunch, I got some  urlLink Lean Pockets .  More specifically, here's my breakfast and lunch for the next two days.  I'm not sure about supper yet, but I probably won't change much about it since it's regularly my most healthy meal of the day.  Today's breakfast:   urlLink Green Machine  Naked juice  Today's lunch:   urlLink Philly Steak & Cheese Lean Pockets  with  urlLink Power C  Naked juice to drink  Today's breakfast:   urlLink Blue Machine  Naked juice  Today's lunch:   urlLink Philly Steak & Cheese Lean Pockets  with  urlLink Well Being  Naked juice to drink  I'm going to spend my lunch hour giving the  urlLink Lied Rec Center  a good looking over.

      This morning, I got up and got ready to start my walk/jog when I realized I didn't know how far a mile was.  After thinking about it, I decided a brisk walk (see last post) for about twenty minutes would approximate a mile.  So, I set my armband radio with a timer of twenty minutes and took off walking.  At one point, I glanced at the timer and it said about nine minutes left, so I turned around and came back.  At the end, I walked briskly for about twenty two minutes, enough to really work up a nice sweat and get my breath puffing.  I am really glad I did this; I feel really awake and alive.  I drank a large glass of water (20 oz. or so) before going out, and I'm drinking a second one now.  After I leave for work this morning, I plan on seeing exactly how far a mile would be from my place, using my truck's odometer.  I also think I'm going to stop at the grocery store and get something remotely healthy for lunch, as opposed to the offerings of the dining places near my work (a hot dog stand and two hamburger joints).
