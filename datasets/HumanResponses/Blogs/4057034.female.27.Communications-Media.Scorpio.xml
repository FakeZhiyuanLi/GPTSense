      Ok, all of you that know me, understand that I am very "pro-homosexuality" right? But, lately this whole fight for gay marriage has been draining me.  This might be my fault, but I'm getting bombarded with support gay marriage emails and stuff.  So, I pose to you this question.... Is there such a thing as too much?  Am I the only lesbian that is annoyed?  I mean, I realize that saying this might get me kicked out of the lesbian hall of fame, but my thinking is that the gay community is more than likely going to support our gay marriage efforts.  So, the people that we really need to be "harassing" (and I say that loosely), are those that don't understand the importance of equality and civil rights.  I may just be totally off base.  What do you think?

      For a while now people have debated to topic of why people are homosexual. Is it a choice? Were you born that way? I have always thought that a person can identify as being homosexual using both ideas. Think about this.....when you look at some children, you may already see behavior that is consisitent with that child being homosexual, i.e., the male that wants to wear mommies makeup and play only with dolls or the female child that hates dresses and plays physical sports. Ok, those are behavior sterotypes, but I work with first grade kids and I question some of their behavior already. So, since these kids are very young....were they born that way?  No one will know until they hit...what...puberty.  But with statistics being one in ten people are potentially  homosexual, this is pretty possible.  Then, you have those that have been heterosexual their entire lives, but meet someone of the same sex and develop and attraction to that person. Maybe they don't understand the attraction and are confused by it, but they want to explore those feelings and date that person. Before you know it, especially with lesbians, they are in a long-term relationship. Could that be latent homosexuality? Is there such a thing? Where they just in the closet? Or is it possible that it is just this one special person that captured their heart, and once the relationship ends they will go back to dating those of the opposite sex? What do you think? There are points to be examined on both sides.

      Last night I went out to a lesbo dive bar and drank beer.  This is interesting because I really can't stand the taste of beer, but hey...it was dollar beer night. ;)  I'm sooooo cheap, hehehe!  What I couldn't figure out though, was why beer makes me burp through my nose.  You know like when you burp the gas burns the hell out of your nasal passageway.   In case you haven't figured it out, I'm in a weird mood tonight :)  Bare with me.

          So I have this emotional friend that drives me crazy.  I mean, she can make me feel guilty for the smallest things.  Even when I try to have serious conversations about what's wrong with our friendship she ends up crying b4 I can finish what I have to say.     This is the latest drama.  She emails me that she is throwing her son a wedding reception/baby shower two weekends ago.  Well, he got sick or something and cancelled.  She reschedules for the following weekend, but I had forgotten when I confirmed with her that I was already committed to something else.   So I call her and give her the info that I won't be able to make it, and she basically says to get out of what I'm doing and be at her event.  That never happened so I left her a voice message saying that I couldn't do it, but I didn't hear back from her.  It's been 3 days since we have spoken or even emailed.     I was trying to be mature about the situation, so I called her and said that we should talk if she was upset.  No reply.  The truth is that I really could care less if she calls me back.  We have had a love/hate relationship for a long time [she has loved me because I give 100% to all of my friendships, but I have hated her for the way that she treats me] lol.  But seriously, this is the first time that I didn't put my life on hold for her and this is her reaction.     I do have some questions for her though...like: Why was it so important that you see me this time, when this past year you have visited CA several times and I've had to learn about it through the lesbian grapevine?  What makes you believe that we are best friends when we don't know anything about each other [I mean deeply]?      Actually, I think I have a problem as well because I'm drawn to her when she is around.  Even though I know that she is bad for me.  Everytime I say that I'm letting her go, I see her face or we talk and I just wilt with the tears.  WTF?  Maybe I'm the emotional one.

      Today I woke up crying hysterically.  I had a dream that my wife passed away.  I don't really remember all of the details, I just remember the sick-to-my-stomach feeling and how painful it was to deal with.  Not to depress anyone, but I wish I had a dream analysis book right now, lol.    On to a random thought:  I just bought the new Wicked Wisdom CD online [it's Jada Pinkett Smith's band] and it's pretty cool.  I kind of expected a India Arie/funk sort of thing but it's more alternative/rock.  It's cool though for an indy-CD.

      Today has been a lazy Sunday for me. Mother nature did a drive by this morning and it crippled me for a large portion of the afternoon. haha! Just a sidebar---I ate at the Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle place in Long Beach, CA tonight and the service was terrible. Not to mention, the tables are always sticky and have leftover food on them. I grew up eating soul food and if this restaurant is supposed to be an example to other races of what soulfood eating is like......it sucks! Try M&amp;M's, at least they offer you water or something to drink within 15 freakin' minutes of you being seated. This is [thank god for girls 76], signing out!

      It's 3 a.m. I have no clue why I cannot sleep tonight but I'm frustrated.  Today was our friends birthday and she really didn't want to celebrate the way that we did.  There were about 8 of us hanging out for the occassion and we wanted to go dancing or do something fun after dinner, but all she wanted to do was stay in and possibly sleep.  Anyway, we convinced her to go out dancing for ladies night and while she was there she stood up, arms crossed with an attitude the whole time (which was only 30 minutes before she made her GF take her home).  She is the only person that I know that can be in love with a woman, but be totally against the lifestyle.  That's the problem with straight chicks that want to try something..."new" with just that one "special" person.  They get to love a woman but not really be a lesbian or they take the "I'm bi" road.  Plus, they get offended when someone does refer to them as a lesbian.  This is actually only a small problem that I have, the truth is that she can go out with the gay guys to their clubs and drink, party, and just come home talking about the fun she had; But when it comes down to going to a lesbian bar with the girls, she starts talking shit and she never wants to go.  It's really a slap in the face to her girlfriend if you ask me and a bit selfish.  Why can't you have just as much fun with the woman that you love, in a place with other lesbians where she might feel comfortable?  I'm puzzled.

      I grew up in San Bernardino, CA and my two siblings and I were raised by our mother. We were very poor, and I don't remember a time when we were not struggling to make ends meet. My mother never married...she dated here and there but nothing was ever really serious. I mean things were tough for her but she made it seem like there wasn't a worry in her mind. Right now I don't have any children but I have a friend that is doubting her parenting abilities with her kid because she and her lover fight over responsibilities and discipline and stuff like that where the kid is concerned. So while she was telling me about the problems, I was afraid to offer any hard advice because I did not feel that I was experienced in this area. However, after thinking about it today this is what I probably should have said on the phone... Firstly, I think you are a good parent. You have raised this kid practically by yourself for her whole life. Yes, being a single mom is hard but being a mom in general is hard as well. Raising a kid is not supposed to be hopscotch and ice cream parties; and then to add a lover in the mix that wants to have say in how you should now go about raising your kid is a lot to handle. My points are these I guess... For one thing, no matter how well a person is brought up, unless they are parents themselves they have no clue how to raise a kid. I mean, just because I work with kids and love them, doesn't mean that I know jack about how to raise one in my own home. Then, I have to say why now are you doubting yourself? You have been raising this kid (whom I might add, is topnotch compared to some of the little assholes I work with) and now you choose to doubt yourself when you get into a longterm relationship. You are the one that knows how to be a parent because you have lived through it. You should be telling her what she is doing wrong and how you expect your child to be disciplined, treated, and ....I don't know RAISED. It would be easy for me to step into any parents life and tell them advice based on what I have "seen other parents or my own doing," but I would be speaking as an outsider trying to get in.  And that's what I think is happening with this situation.

      Today was such a relaxing day.  I spent most of the day with my wife just playing games, eating, and enjoying each other's company.  The only thing was that the phone didn't ring more than two times.  For those of you that know me, this is unusual because I am always chattin it up with someone.  It was super-nice not to have the phone ringing off the hook, but in the back of my head I wonder why no one called.  I know that's crazy.  I must have a split personality or something because I want people to call me and say hello, but I really don't feel like I have good conversations with some of my old friends.  My wife tells me that I'm moody and that I still have a connection with them but I often wonder if I even want to.  I'm rambling a bit so just bare with me.... Is it possible to separate your friends like:  A) Friends that have the same values B) Friends I would like to grow old with and vacation with C) Friends that are around now, but you know that there is no solid connection that will keep you together for a long period of time???  And if this is so, should I just ditch the friends that fall into category C right now?
