       When I moved into my house two years ago, the AC was on the blink.  After a good cleaning, it started working fine and has been working fine for two years now.  My good friend Jay's AC just went out about a week ago, and it is going to cost him five large to replace.  He could pay 900 (or something) to fix it, but then you get into the whole "do you fix it or replace it" argument.  I don't know a thing about ACs and the guy is telling him to replace it.  If it were me, I have no idea what I would do.  My gut feeling would be replace it, but that's a lot of money.  A lot of money.  I hope that mine can last a few more years.  Speaking of houses, another friend of mine, Carrie, made an offer on a house yesterday, and today it was accepted.  She plans to move into in August and is very excited.   urlLink     Here is a picture of her new house!

          These are my neighbors' digs and the bane of my exsistance.  Okay, they're not that bad, but sometimes I wish they would just shut up.  They know when I am trying to take a nap, watch a movie or read a book.  They know at what time my alarm is set for and start barking about an hour before that.     urlLink     They sit on my neighbors' deck and look over the fense, at what I don't know.   The bad news is that my nice neighbors are moving Wednesday.  The good news is that they are taking the dogs!!!

       My grandparents are coming to visit me this weekend.  I have no idea when they are coming tonight, so I am stuck at the house all night waiting on them to show.  There is a possibility that they will get here too late to come over at all.  Tomorrow we are going to the botanical gardens.  I have never been there, so that won't be so bad.  Then I suppose we will go to lunch somewhere.  After lunch I am lost.  Who knows what they will want to do.  I guess I can show them where I work, or we could go to the state park or something.  I hope they don't want to go to the Space & Rocket center.  It is so boring!  More than likely we will end up sitting in my living room talking about nothing in general.  I will have to endure comments on how I haven't married yet and how I have put on weight.  I will smile and try to steer the conversation to their lives.  Don't get me wrong, I love my grandparents, but we just aren't that close.  Any ideas on how to make it through the weekend?     These aren't my grandparents, but you get the idea.

       Have you ever heard of the runner's zone or a runner's high.  Supposedly at that point a runner feels like they could run forever.  I have no idea about that because running is always hard for me, but sometimes I can get that way at work.  I am a software engineer, so my work consists of designing, writing and testing code.  When I get in the 'zone' everything is in my head at once, and I am so productive it is almost hard for me to believe.  If the phone rings or if I get an email or if some other distraction bothers me, I drop  out of the 'zone,' and it takes me another 20 minutes to get back in the groove.  You can see how since I get interrupted every 15 minutes, I'd never get a chance to get into the 'zone.'  Yesterday at 4:45 I was there.  Everything was clicking, and I didn't want to leave.  I stayed a little late, but this morning I wonder if I will be able to get back to that super productive state again today.  Posting on this Blog isn't helping.  I know that.

       I am leaving today to go on a bachelor party for one of my good friends.  We are going to Las Vegas and staying at the MGM Grand.  The downside is that I am out of money, so everything goes on the credit card this trip.  I might play a little blackjack, but for the most part I will be avoiding spending (which is hard to do in LV)

       Jay's pool pump seized up last night which combined with all that has happened to him this summer was insult to injury.  Jay and Betsy were planning a trip to Italy in the Fall, but who knows if that will happen now.  I am sure this all happened for a reason.  I have started a fund to help them through this unfortunate summer:   urlLink please donate

       Katie, Austin, Anna and I went over to my grandparent's house this weekend.  I wanted to see my grandfather, because he just had surgery on his back.  I also wanted them to meet Katie.  My grandparents are very Southern, and Katie had trouble at times understanding them.   Granny told us all about Paw's surgery.  (Paw wasn't saying much as usual)  She told us how a nerve had become pinched in his back, but that the surgery was a success, and he was only in the hospital for a few nights.  My grandmother couldn't stay with him at night because the hospital didn't have a private room available, so she had to go home each night.  That wouldn't be a big deal, but she had never slept alone in her life.  She grew up living with her family, and then moved in with my grandfather.  She is 75 years old, and last week was her first night alone.  She told us that she made a pile of pillows in the bed so she could go to sleep.  She also was worried about taking her medicine at night.  She didn't want to choke on the pills when no one was there to help her.  I felt sorry for her, but then my grandfather told her that she should start getting use to it and that he didn't "buy bananas anymore unless they were ripe."  (I didn't get it at first, but I guess that was his way of saying that he won't be around too much longer)  Sunday on the way home, Katie called her parents.  They must have asked her what she thought of Mississippi, because she said, "it is just like you would think it would be.  Just like the movies."  I had grown up my whole life hating the way movies depicted Mississippi.  They make it out to be a hot, dirty, run-down place full of ignorant racist people with over-Southern accents.  I always thought the movies were completely off base, but now I wonder how close they really are.  When I asked Katie what she thought she told me that she enjoyed her stay, but that she wouldn't want to live there.  I tend to agree.

       Katie and I are going to my parents' house this weekend.  We are leaving right after work and plan to stop to eat and get gas in Tuscaloosa.  It will take about 5 hours to get there, but we rented a book on CD, so the drive won't feel that long.  (I am not so sure about the book.  It sounds like a woman book.  More on that when I return.)  Here is the path we'll take:   urlLink     Madison to Clinton

       Last night Katie and I were doing our own thing, so I decided to mow the grass and knock out some personal budget stuff that I have been meaning to do for weeks.  I didn't really feel like going out to eat, so I threw a frozen pizza in the oven.  Ten minutes later the timer went off, so I put on my oven glove and opened the door.    The pizza was directly on the oven rack per the instructions for a crispy crust, but when I tried to slide the pizza off of the rack and onto the box it came in--it was stuck.  No biggy. That has happened before.  I grabbed a spatula and started jabbing at the bottom, trying to pry it off.  Finally it detached (leaving some not so small pieces still on the rack) and I slid it on the box.    I reached over to set the spatula down, and the box fell out of my oven-mitted hand.  The pizza fell face down onto the open oven door and started to sizzle.  This had never happened before.  My first instinct was to grab it with my free hand, but luckily I realized that the oven door was hot as crap before I tried it.    Pizza still sizzling on the door, I tore open the utensils drawer and grabbed a pair of tongs.  Using the tongs, I transported the upside-down pizza from the oven door to the box again.  Most of the cheese and toppings were still on the pizza, so I wasn't that bummed.    I set the box down on the kitchen counter and turned to get the pizza cutter.  As I turned, my elbow knocked over a full glass of old coke water (coke and ice that had melted), and all the water ran into the open utensil drawer before the glass rolled off the counter, hit the drawer, and smashed to the ground.  Now I had a problem.    My oven was filthy, pizza and broken glass were all over the floor, and I was barefoot and still hungry.  I tiptoed across the kitchen floor to get the broom and swept up the mess.  After the glass was gone (is glass really ever gone?  I will be afraid to walk in there for days) I ate the messed-up pizza.  Later that night I put the oven on self-clean mode rather than clean the melted cheese off of the door.  I also had to take everything out of that drawer and dry it out.  My kitchen is still a disaster.  Now I can laugh at what all had happened last night, but sometimes I wonder how I have gotten this far...

       It is hard to believe, but today is the first day of Summer.  In Huntsville, we have had what feels like a month of Summer weather already.  For three more months grass will be cut, families will take vacations, baseball will be played, schools will be empty, air-conditioners will be run to death, kids will go swimming, girls will lay out, ice cream will be full price, people will flock to the beach and cars will get washed in the drive way.  By the middle of August I will be ready for it to be over, but in Alabama we will still get punished for at least another month.  At some Labor Day party I will wonder where the time had gone and won't believe that the Summer is already over.  Luckily, the LORD has given us football, and the cycle will go on.  What do you like most about Summer?

       I had a blast this weekend.  Friday night a bunch of us went to McAlister's and to see Dodgeball.  It was funny, and I wasn't expecting anything more.  After the movie, I went home to pack a lunch and get ready for canoeing on Saturday.  Katie drove Saturday morning, and we left around 8:00.  We didn't get on the river until a little after 10:00.  Katie and I canoed, and Jay and Betsy each had a kayak.  There was one section that was really rough, and Jay didn't think it was possible to do on the kayak.  Below is a picture of me proving him wrong:   urlLink     Master and Commander    urlLink click here  to see the rest of the pictures...  The trip was fun, but Jay lost his wedding ring.  That kind of put a damper on the whole day.  We were all tired when we got home at 5:00, but we had agreed to go to a birthday party at a co-worker's house.  I am really glad we went, because the house was beautiful.  I want a house like that one day.  Sunday was relaxing.  After church, Katie and I finished off the chicken spaghetti that I made last Wednesday.  Then I did some chores:  I mowed the grass, put out weed killer, helped Katie wash our cars and printed invitations for a wedding shower that I am hosting for Chip.  (After the 3rd envelope, my printer ran out of toner.  Gag.  $50 for a new toner!)  Then Katie and I had sandwiches for dinner to end a great relaxing day.  While I was putting around doing my chores, Katie washed both of our clothes.  She even ironed some of my shirts.  I am so blessed.

       Tonight a group of us are going out to eat and to check out the new movie Dodgeball.  It looks pretty funny, but it could be a let down.  I will have a good time either way.  Saturday Katie and I are going canooing down Bear Creek.  Jay and Betsy are coming with us, but they are watercraft snobs and are kayaking.  We went last year and had a great time.  We plan to be in the water by 10:00 and be out by around 2:00, stopping to eat lunch in the middle.  It is going to be hot, but the water is going to be cold!  Sunday is Father's Day.  I didn't get my dad anything, but I will give him a call.  I am going home next weekend and will get to see him then.

       It had been two weeks since the last time it rained, and my grass was looking sick for sure.  The weather report has been 30% chance of rain for at least a week, so I had been waiting on a good rain.  Last night I decided I couldn't take the chance on it not raining, so I set the timer to dump huge amounts of water on the front yard.  It rained hard last night and has continued raining all day today.  Next time I will just wash my car.  Must less water wasted that way.

       What a nice, relaxing weekend.  I only took Friday off, but it feels like I just got back from a long vacation.  Brady flew back this morning, (because of weather delays, his flight was cancelled Sunday) and now everything is back to normal.  I picked Brady up Thursday after work, and we went to Rosie's (a local Mexican restaurant).  We went back to my house and watched the Pistons put it to the Lakers.  After the NBA game we played a few games of football on the XBOX, then we went to bed.  Friday morning I got to sleep in a little bit.  When I got up, Brady was playing football, but instead of a normal game he had started a franchise.  In a franchise, the point of the game is to manage the business side of the football team.  If anyone has ever played a strategic management game, (like Lemonade Stand from the 1980's) they know how addicting it can be.  We played that until about 3:00, then we went over to Jay's house to go swimming.  Katie met us at my house at 6:00, and we cooked out that night.  We sat on the deck, but it was a little warmer that night than it has been all year.  Katie left around 10:30, and Brady and I played some more of the football game until late.  It felt like I was back in high school.  We had a blast.  Saturday we decided to go to Chattanooga.  We slept in a little and didn't leave until around 10:00.  Once we got there, we ate lunch and drove up Lookout Mountain stopping at Ruby Falls.  We took the one-hour tour of the cave.  It was fun, I guess.  (It was better than being outside, for sure.  Saturday was the hottest day we've had for a long time.)  After Ruby Falls, we headed over to the aquarium.  (To me, if you have seen one aquarium, you've seen them all.  This one was nicer than the one in New Orleans, but not as nice as the one in Boston.)  We spent a while in the aquarium and then headed over to a comedy club.  We were early, so we grabbed something to eat in a restaurant that was attached.  The comedy show was pretty funny.  It cost $11, and it was worth that for sure.  I think that they make all of their money on drinks, but I didn't help them out too much because I had to drive home.  We got back a little after 10:00.  We watched a rerun of SNL then went to bed.  Sunday morning Brady, Katie and I went to church, but it was an awful day to take Brady.  The high school aged choir took over the service with songs and drama.  It wasn't painful, but that's all I'll say.  We almost went to Sunday school, but there wasn't time for us to do that and eat and get Brady to the airport.  After waiting about twenty minutes at Cracker Barrel, we got a table.  It was around 50 degrees in the restaurant, and even I was cold.  Katie was freezing.  We ate as quick as we could and left, but I think that is what CB wanted us to do.  Katie and I dropped Brady at the airport about an hour before his flight and went back to my house.  When we got there, Brady called and said that his flight had been cancelled (because of bad weather in Atlanta), so I went back to the airport to pick him up.  We just hung out that afternoon relaxing and playing XBOX.  Katie watched us and thought we were  urlLink pretty dumb .  Eventually we ordered a pizza and watched Love Actually.  Brady's flight was at 6:45 this morning, so I had to wake up at 5:30 to take him, (I was surprised how many people were awake at 5:30) so today I am a zombie.    You could say that I am having a case of the Mondays...

        What is this?  Another NEW COKE?!  Not quite.  You can see that the can has changed to the new black on red format, but the biggest change is it has half the calories of real coke!  (They accomplish this by using Splenda.) They are targeting those who would like not as many calories (me), but still want the same great taste (me).  Looks like I am their market.  This could change my life! It means that I can now drink twice as much coke as before.  Actually it means that I might loose a little weight, and I could stand to loose a few.  (Please, no comments on that last statement.)

       Brady, one of my friends since 8th grade, is coming to visit me this weekend.  He is flying in around 5, so I will go pick him up after work.  I am taking Friday off, so we will have all day Friday and Saturday to do whatever.  He doesn't leave until 2:00 on Sunday, so I think that we will have time to go to church before I have to take him back to the airport.  I haven't really talked to him in a while, so there is a lot I need to catch up on.  I know that he has been dating a girl for almost six months, so I want to hear about that for sure.  He will get to meet Katie Friday night, and I am sure that he will want to talk about that.  I am not sure what our plans are be, but here are some possible ideas:  Friday, It would be fun to go swimming at Jay's during the day and grill out that night.  Saturday I was thinking maybe a day trip to Chattanooga.  I have no idea what to do there, but we can figure it out. (Does anybody something fun to do in Chattanooga?)  None of this is set in stone, and we may end up playing XBOX all weekend.

       Joel, Daniel and I went to JFR for lunch today.  It is a country meat and three that also serves sandwiches, etc.  When the place opened up about 25 years ago they decorated and situated everything just so, and I am guessing they haven't changed since.  The place seemed clean and they took credit cards.  I had a hamburger and fries.  Not the worst burger ever, but not even close to the best.  It is about what I would have expected from a dinner attached to a gas station in a rural area, maybe a little worse.  The waitress was nice enough, but did get my bill wrong.  It took a while for my burger to come out, but that wasn't her fault.  I tried their coconut pie for desert, but I am pretty sure that it was out of a box.  Let's just say I didn't find a reason to return.  My ratings:  Food 2/5 Service 3/5 Atmosphere 3/5  Overall 2.5/5

       This morning I went to the dentist for my bi-annual cleaning. My hygienist was telling me about her son going on a mission trip to KY and that he would be replacing a roof and siding. I couldn't believe it, because my friend Jay is gone all week on the same trip. He is a youth leader at a local church, and her son must be in his youth group. I asked her if she knew Jay, and she did. So while I held my mouth open for 30 minutes, she talked non-stop about Jay and all that he does. Small world.   Also, my teeth are in good shape.

       Friday night Katie and I went to see HP3. I read the book, but it was so long ago that making comparisons would be pointless. Here are my comments on just the movie:   urlLink Alfonso Cuarón  (Y tu mamá también, Great Expectations) was the director of the third of the series of Harry Potter movies and without a doubt brought his own vision and his own version of story telling to it. One of the most noticeable departures from the last two movies was the overall darkness. All through the movie whether inside or outside, the characters were surrounded by a gloom. Of all the changes, the monsters were especially darker (and scarier) to the extent that some children in the theater with me were uncomfortably scared at points. Mood wasn't the only change. Cuarón also got away from page by page story telling that elongated the first two films. Even though he left out some small details in the book, it made for an overall smoother (and shorter) experience.  Once again the cast revolved around  urlLink Daniel Radcliffe  (Harry),  urlLink Rupert Grint  (Ron) and  urlLink Emma Watson  (Hermione). It is interesting watching these actors grow up, and not just from children to teenagers. While they still aren't challenged with what I concider deep roles, you can tell that they are growing as actors. Since the first movie came out, I have wondered how being a cute young kid would translate into becoming a talented adult actor. (If they keep up with the current pace, these three may hit 21 before the 7th movie.) Who knows, after they go through puberty and don't fit into Hollywood's mold the studio might change out Radcliff and Watson for Orlando Bloom and Natalie Portman. It wouldn't surprise me.  Two new additions to the cast were  urlLink David Thewlis  (Professor Lupin) and  urlLink Gary Oldman  (Sirius Black). Thewlis did a great job and was a very believable as the new professor of Dark Arts, but it was Oldman that shined with his portrayal of the madman Sirruis Black (if just for a few scenes). Oldman's Black fit right into Cuarón's dark theme (as if the whole movie was a build up to Black's introduction to the story). I really hope that Oldman stays on for HP4 when his character will have an expanded role.  I was actually a little surprised that the movie received a PG rating. Some of the fighting scenes, including werewolves among other creatures, were very realistic and took place near the children in the movie. Although there wasn't any bad language or sex in the movie, it was such a dark and scary version of Harry Potter that it is probably not suited for children under the age of 9.  Overall, the movie stayed true to Rawlings' well loved book, but had its drawbacks in my opinion.  Like the previous Hary Potter movies, the special effects were fun to watch, but the overall darkness of the movie wasn't what I was expecting. I liked the movie, but it felt like a Dementor (evil life-draining monsters) sucked a little fun out of this one, at least for me.   My Rating: 3 and a half stars

       I borrowed a friend's pressure washer yesterday to clean my driveway.  It did a great job, and I never realized how dirty it was until I cleaned it.  What I hadn't expected was how long it took to clean.  Katie came over after church, and she took turns with me otherwise I wouldn't have gotten as far.  The sad part is that I didn't finish.  I didn't even get close to half done.  It will probably take another 5 hours to finish!

After dinner, we rented  School of Rock .  It was funny, but for some reason I was expecting a little more.  Has anyone seen it?

       I am pretty excited about Halo 2, and it doesn't come out until September 9th.   "Halo 2 is a lot like Halo, only it's Halo on fire, going 130 miles per hour through a hospital zone, being chased by helicopters and ninjas," explained Jason Jones, head of Bungie Studios. "And the ninjas are all on fire, too."

       My weekend was full of swimming, projects, and eating.  My girlfriend, Katie, was out of town this weekend which was suppose to leave me with a lot of time to myself, but it didn't exactly happen that way.    Friday night was pretty sorry.  I just sat around and read, and wished that Katie was in town.  Saturday morning I got my oil changed.  (I hadn't changed it for like 7000 miles, so it was due)  I couldn't waste too much time, because I  had to go to a wedding at 10:00am.  (The earliest wedding ever)  The reception was sort of like a brunch and the food was good.  Later that day Jay and I helped Daniel lay a concrete slab as a foundation for a tool shed in Daniel's backyard.  The rest of the night I washed clothes and watched Indiana Jones.  The next morning I went to church, and Sunday school was pretty good.  Trey lead (he normally doesn't), and I could tell that he spent a lot of time preparing.  It was one of the more interesting classes that we have had in a while.  After church, I ate lunch with my Sunday school class at a Mexican place in town.  I went over to Jay's swam for a while, then we (Jay and I) worked on a project for his youth group.  He is taking his youth group on a mission trip to replace siding on a old house.  We build some scaffolding so the kids could reach the tops of the eaves.  Jay had a really good design, so it was fun putting it together.  We didn't work too long, because we had to get some more swimming in.  (Chip and Natalie also came over)  Betsy made a great dinner, and we enjoyed the nice weather.  Sunday's always seem like the best day.  Monday was almost a total waste of a day.  The only thing productive that I did was make some snacks for Daniel's party.  (I will post the recipes in the comments section)  The party was lots of fun.  Daniel also has a pool, so there was more swimming followed by more eating followed by sitting around a fire.  I guess my Monday was spent relaxing which isn't a total waste.  So far, I have been very relaxed and focused today at work, so I call the weekend a success.  Tonight, I pick Katie up from the airport.  I am ready for her to be back.

       We played Balderdash again last night, and  Rat Pfink a Boo Boo  was one of the movie titles that we had to invent a plot for.  Some of the guesses were real gems, but I will let Joel share them with you.  Here is a link to the real movie:   urlLink      Interesting side note:   urlLink Here  is a band by the same name.

       Katie and I went to a wedding yesterday in Toney, AL which was about 30 minutes away.  We got there 30 minutes before the time on the invitation and were some of the last to arrive. The wedding was more of a production than a church service.  There were seven songs performed by various people, but not one Bible scripture was mentioned.  All the songs seemed to make it last forever.  After the "service," the preacher told us all that the happy couple had already taken their pictures and was waiting for us in the fellowship hall.  He was wrong.  Everyone piled out of the church to go over to the FH, but they wouldn't let anyone in until the couple had arrived.  They were taking pictures, so everyone had to wait outside in the heat for something like 20 minutes.  The worst part of it was that Katie wasn't even with me, because she had go inside to help serve.  I was all alone.  By the time I made it through the buffet all the seats were taken.  I ended up sitting at a table full of close friends.  Another person close to them was being taken to the hospital in Birmingham for severe burns to his hands and arms.  As they were talking about making a trip to see him, I felt so out of place.  Finally the guy next to me said, "I don't think that I know you."  I told him, "That's fine.  I don't know anyone here."  We all laughed when I told them that my girlfriend brought me, but she was busy cutting the cake.  When it was time to catch the bouquet, about 40 girls were in a pile screaming and throwing elbows.  Katie was at the back, I guess playing free safety.  Luckily, the bride didn't use all of her strength, so Katie didn't catch it.  She finally got to get a plate, and I got to talk to her for a while.  We sat with some of her friends, and they were nice.  We left after the bride and groom left in a horse drawn carriage.  The best part of the whole day was Katie's new outfit.  She almost never spends money on herself, but she got an awesome outfit from Banana Republic yesterday for the wedding.  I don't think that I have seen her look better, and it made up for all the other crap I had to go through.

       Last night I played some poker with the guys.  We played Texas two-card Hold'em.  It was a lot of fun, and I was the big winner.  (by "big winner" I mean I won $5.)  I have been really busy at work the last few weeks.  A cool new project is taking all of my time.  I still had some other tasks related to an old project, but I have a co-op that is going to be doing some of that.  In the long run it will free me up, but right now I am spending a lot of time teaching him what to do.  He is a good student, so I think he will help me sooner than later.  Katie's parents are coming into town tonight.  They sold their house in South Dakota and are planning to move to Huntsville.  They are going to spend a week down here looking for houses.  I am not sure if they are looking to rent or buy.  Her dad is real handy and has tons of tools, so I am excited about it.  Katie seems less excited to me, but I know she wants them here.  Tonight my friend, Phillip, and I are going to a dinner and a movie.  He hasn't been able to go out with me for a long time.  His son, John, takes up most of his time now.  Ashley is taking John to see her parents this weekend, so we are going to hit the town.  Sunday I am throwing a birthday party for Joel.  He will be 25.  If anyone reads this and wants to come, feel free.  I am grilling burgers and brats, and I think that Katie is going to pick up an ice cream cake.  I guess I should clean the house tomorrow for the party.

       Today Jay, Joel and I went to Greenbriar restaurant today for NET. NET stands for "No Excuse Tuesdays." It is our weekly Bible study. We have spent this year reading through the Bible a little at a time. Each day we have a section of the Old Testament to read and a section of the New Testament. Here is the  urlLink schedule  that we use.  Right now we are in the middle of Psalms in the OT. We talked about how some of the early chapters in Psalms almost song like whining. The problem is that it is really hard to relate to the type of life that David was living when he wrote his songs. Jay said that the worst part of his life is still probably better than anything David went through, and I agree (except for maybe the 500 wives part).  In the NT, Acts tells about Paul's journey through Greece and Italy spreading the good news. Everywhere he goes people accept his teachings, but the Jews violently oppose him and try to run him out of town. Paul was run out of so many towns that he became discouraged and wanted to quit preaching to the Jews, but God said,  "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent." -  urlLink Acts 18:9   There are many other great stories in Acts, but I don't have time to detail them all.  After talking about the Bible and stuffing our faces with hushpuppies, we had to run by the mall so Jay could pick up his replacement wedding ring.&nbsp; (He lost his original on a  urlLink canoeing trip ) Joel and I wanted to let our lunch settle, so we waited in the car, but Jay was back in no time.  Time to get back to work.  I have a new co-op to train...

       Yesterday my power went out, and as I was getting ready to go to bed I set my alarm.  (Please tell me not the AM/PM thing again)  It was the old AM/PM mess up.  I woke up at 8:00 freezing!  Why was I so cold?  Also last night as I was getting ready for bed, I dropped the thermostat a few degrees because it was a little warm in my bedroom.  When I woke up this morning I was shivering.  I got out of bed and went straight to look at the thermostat which read "batt low."  Great!  It's fail safe is to run the AC non-stop.  What if the battery had gone low while I was on vacation!?  Anyway, all the windows in the house were fogged up, and I had to stand in the shower a while to warm my body up.  (That is a first in July)    If I hadn't been late for work, I would have checked it out, but all I did was shut the air off and leave.  Maybe by the time I get home my house will be back up to 72 degrees.  I don't want to see the power bill.

       I found a picture of a fish made out of watermelon on the Internet last week.      Here is the one I copied   I thought it would be neat to do try this for the party last Saturday.  It looks like they had a kit to make it, but I had no idea where to get that, so I made all the fins out of construction paper and the eyes out of kiwi.  Betsy did most of the work.  She hollowed out the watermelon, and made the fruit salad to go in it.   urlLink     Here is my version - click it for a closer look   I think that everyone got a kick out of it.   urlLink Click here  to see a few more pictures of the party.

       Tomorrow morning, Jay and Betsy, Jonathan and Patti and I are hosting a wedding shower for Chip and Natalie.  The shower starts at 11:00, and it is at Jay and Betsy's house.  We are going to eat, open presents and then go swimming.  The theme is a luau, and we have lots of decorations, etc.  I think that we are going to have a lot of fun.  Chip and Natalie gave us a list of people to invite, and we send out invitations a few weeks ago.  We got some really neat luau cards from a local stationary place, and I printed them with a cool font on my printer.  They looked close to professional.  Only one person has regretted so far, so we could end up having anywhere between 35 to 50 people show up, depending on who brings a date or whatever.  Feeding that many people is no small feat.  Since there are guys invited to the party, finger foods just wouldn't do.  We are planning on pulled pork sandwiches from Smokey's (Luau meets deep South), chips, cheese and crackers, spinach dip in Hawaiian bread, tons and tons of fruit including a carved watermelon, and for desert we'll have orange and lime sherbet.  For drinks we will have a punch that Jay is making, sweet tea and water.  The problem with parties this size is you never know how many people will come, how many people won't eat at all, how many people will get three plates of food, etc.  Planning is a nightmare.  You either end up with so much left over that you have to throw a lot away or 30 minutes into the party there is nothing left.  We'll see what happens.  Technically this is a wedding shower, because people are bringing presents, but I think that it will be a lot less formal for two reasons:  1) It is a pool party.  How formal can a pool party be? 2) Guy are invited.  This changes the whole mood of a shower from finger sandwiches to pulled pork.  I think that everyone will be relaxed and have a great time.    At the same time this is part of our wedding present to Chip and Natalie, and so we want everything to be nice.  I hope that this will be a special party for them.  I think that we have done our best (short of spending $1000) so far in planning it, so I am optimistic that it will be a hit.  Tonight the hosts (and Katie) are all going over to Jay and Betsy's house to help clean and set things up for the party.  We will probably make some of the food and set up the tables and chairs.  Then tomorrow morning we will get the rest of the food ready and then wait for the first guest.  Should be fun.

       Trick question, because there is usually nothing good that comes from Detroit.  Today, however, Katie is flying in from Detroit, and she is pretty dang awesome.    It feels like I haven't seen her in a month.  She has been up North for so long, it will probably take me a few days before I can understand half of what she says.  (I never do better than half)  Actually, I wonder if I will even recognize her at the airport.  She told me that she got her hair cut while she was up there, but I am pretty sure that I will be able to pick her out of the crowd.  She will be the only person wearing a plaid flannel shirt under a sweatshirt under a jacket.    I am really amazed how Katie stays so cold.  It will be a normal temperature in my house, and she will be on the couch under a blanket.  We will be at the movie theater and she will be shivering, clutched to my arm.  It will be 85 degrees outside and she will take her jacket.  Blows my mind.  I can almost guarantee that she will be wearing a jacket when I pick her up today.  Her plane lands around 4:00, so I will have to leave a little early today, which is great because I am ready to spend some time with her.  We had talked about going to Jade Palace (her favorite Chinese place) tonight, and I am excited about that.  She is taking off of work tomorrow to extend her vacation to an unreal 11 days.  (I sure wish I could have a vacation that long!)  I may end up taking off tomorrow afternoon and hanging out with her.  It would be fun to go swimming at Jay's or maybe wash our cars.  More than likely we will get ready for Chip and Natalie's wedding shower Saturday morning.  (More on the shower tomorrow...)

       In the last two weeks Huntsville has received 5.4 inches of rain.  In that time my new neighbor has mowed his yard zero times.  It is two feet high in spots.  He has lived there over a month and has cut the grass once.  This is his first house, so maybe I should give him a break.  UPDATE: When I got home from work today, the front yard had been mowed.

       Saturday morning I helped Jay build a new gate for his fence out of some leftover wood.  The old gate was hard to open.  It used to be two equal length doors that drug the ground when you tried to open them.  They were bulky and since neither were anchored it was awkward getting in and out, especially if their dogs were on the other side.    We chose to reuse the old hinges because they were anchored into the brick columns.  We had to adjust our design a little bit, because they were bent from supporting the old gate.  In the new design, we made one of the doors longer and more permanent, so they can use the smaller, easier to open door most of the time. We also raised the frame height an inch, and now both gates can open all the way back.  We finished building the frames and attaching them to the hinges in about 3 hours.  I went home at that point, but after I left Jay and Betsy attached the pickets.  Later Jay added some hardware and anchored the large door.  Here is a picture:   urlLink    Jay's new gate&nbsp; urlLink

       I guess I saw this coming, because she asked me the other day if I would take her to the airport.  Really, She is just visiting her family in Minnesota for a week.  (I hope she comes back!) While she is there, she will help host a baby shower for both her new niece and nephew.   urlLink Here  is a picture of the babies with their Auntie Katie and Auntie Kim.  Hanna is on the left with Kim, and Katie is holding Trent.  While Katie is gone I will have lots of free time--something that I haven't had in a while.  My yard could use a little attention, and I think that I might read some, but other than that I don't have many plans.  I am going swimming July 4th before going to watch the fireworks show that the city puts on.  I also told Jay that I would help him re-build the gates on his fence.  They are old and sagging in the middle.  You could say we are giving them a tummy tuck.  The worst part about her leaving me is that I will have to wait to see Spiderman 2.  From all accounts it is one of the best made movies ever.  I might go see it with a group of people and then take her when she gets back.  If the movie is really that good, I will want to see it twice anyway.

       My neighbor gave me a little entertainment last night trying to mow his grass.    First, his grass has "maxed out" meaning that it has grown as tall as it can.  You would think that he has been out of town for weeks.  It is so bad that the weeds in his yard are fully mature with seed heads and everything.  I have only seen weeds that tall in a book.  Honestly, I have mowed my yard 3-4 times since the last time he mowed.  I had given up on it being mowed the rest of this year.  Yesterday after work I heard a lawn mower start up next door.  I couldn't believe it. The mower didn't run long before it started choking down.  Chur-chunk! Chur-chunk!  I moved over to the window to check things out.  Black smoke was spewing out of the mower, and I assumed that the engine was getting too much gas.  After maybe 10 feet of mowing he stoped the mower and checked the oil.  He seemed satisfied with the oil, so he started up the mower again.  This time it was worse.  The engine was alternating running fast and slow, and black smoke was still pumping out.  He pushed the mower around the yard as fast as he could to knock over some of the tallest weeds, but it died very quickly.  Next he did something a little odd.  He picked up the gas can, uncaped the nossle and smelled it.  Obviously not satisfied with the smell, he held the red plastic can up to the sun studying the liquid inside.  At this point, I am guessing that he had mixed oil in the gas (like you do for 2 cylce engines) by mistake.  He sat there for a while pondering the situation and then tiped the can over and poured the gas  in his yard!!!!!   I let out a audible gasp.  I knew then that I needed to help him, so I went into my front yard pretending to prune some bushes.  By the time I made it out there, he had taken off somewhere in his car.  I ended up pruning my crape murtle for real before he came back.  He had moved his lawn mower into the back yard to avoid looking stupid, I guess.  I heard more failed attemps, and finally he stuck his head over the fense.  I asked him if everything is okay.    He said, "I think that my gas had become unstable,"  He has only lived in the house two months and only cut the grass twice.  "I went to the store and got some new gas, so it should be fine now.  There is just some bad gas still in the fuel line. The air filter might also need replacing.  I think that I've got it."    There is like a 1% chance that the fuel had gone bad in 2 months.  I wanted so bad to ask him when was the last time he used his mower.  I wanted him to admit to me that it was 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Finally, I suggested that the fuel/air mix may be off.  He told me that there is no way to set that, and that he needed to look at the manual.  It was getting dark, so I told him that he could use my mower whenever he needed it, but he didn't seem to keen on that idea.   I guess I am going to just have to wait this one out.  or mow it myself
