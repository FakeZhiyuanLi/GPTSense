        urlLink  West   Ham's    fans are fantastic says Sergei Rebrov, Hammer's latest signing from neighbours and rivals, Spurs (Spurs of course think Arsenal are their great rivals, whilst Millwall think they're our rivals. Dream on. West Ham's Moore than just a football team).    In an implicit criticism of the funeral-like atmosphere of White Heart Lane, Serge said:    "It was a good atmosphere and the supporters stayed with us; they saw we were working hard and we got there in the end."   Good lad that Sergei.

       Accident prone Tory treasury spokesman, Oliver Letwin (you might remember him as the one who went into hiding during the last General Election. I seem to remember Newsnight eventually finding him in what I can only describe as a toga party in his constituency, but that might be my all too vivid imagination playing tricks on me) has once again shot himself and his party in the foot with the attempt to outflank Labour's plans the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI).  Labour plans to reduce waste and red tape by reducing the numbers of civil servants. The trade union that represents the majority of civil servants, the PCS (headed by that well known moderating influence, Mark Serwotka) are understandably not terribly happy about the plans and are lobbying hard against the proposals (according to my mate in the PCS).  Rather than let the PCS continued to give the Government a hard time, Letwin thought he dramatically seize the news agenda by the tail by outflanking Labour, announcing yesterday in a not-quite blaze of publicity he wants to gut the DTI,  urlLink www.conservatives.com/news/article.cfm?obj_id=113696  , slashing the department by 80% and putting nearly 5,000 people out of work.  Naturally the PCS went 'off on one'  urlLink http://www.pcs.org.uk/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=892451   More interestingly, the CBI (the self-styled "voice of business") also put the boot in, too     "The DTI must have the resources it needs to do the job. There is a world of difference between streamlining a department and cutting it to the bone to the point of emasculation." Said the CBI Director General.        Even the free market right wing business special interest group, the Institute of Directors, couldn't bring themselves to give unqualified support for Letwin  urlLink www.iod.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/GBP/IODDirectLink-Start?Type=Content&TemplateName=Advice/VPO.isml&amp;ShowOldMenu=true   "The Institute of Directors (IoD) today welcomed the thrust of the Shadow Chancellor's recommendations on reform of the Department of Trade and Industry in that they focused on making the DTI more effective rather than eliminate it.....Without being able to audit specific costs, the Institute of Directors (IoD) said it welcomed any proposals to drive greater efficiency within the public sector." Read between the lines.  It's a bit off when you can't even get your friends to back you up on something.  J

       Just been glancing at the Metropolitan Police's website. I've recently become a big fan of the Met Police (more of that in a another post) and their site is filled with really interesting stuff:  urlLink www.met.police.uk   The most wanted section features a particularly gruesome line-up:  urlLink www.met.police.uk/mostwanted/index.htm   But what took my eye in particular was the safer neighbourhood initiative  urlLink www.met.police.uk/saferneighbourhoods  aka putting bobbies back onto the beat. As the official blurb says:    "The Safer Neighbourhoods programme gives you a team of police dedicated to your local area. This team includes a Sergeant, two Constables and three Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs). Their role will be to work with the community and local authorities to reduce crime and disorder and deal with the local issues that most affect people’s quality of life."  The initial wave concentrates on the perceived highest crime areas in each Borough, but I understand that this is to be rolled out across  whole boroughs. Marvellous stuff. The Richmond safer neighbourhood team covers mortlake and barnes,  richmond town centre. For a map showing the area  urlLink www.met.police.uk/richmond/richmond_map.pdf   This has largely been paid for by the increases in the GLA precept on Londoner's Council Tax. Together with greater police powers - dispersal areas, anti-social behaviour orders, etc the police now have the numbers and the authority to crack down on anti social behaviour and crime. And Michael Howard has the cheek to say Labour is soft on crime.

       Ken's going to expand the congestion charge to west London. Don't know what I think of that; have to ponder over it a bit first.  What I do know is that a cyclist and a pedestrian central London is better because of the congestion charge. Less polluted. Cleaner. Less congested. More pleasant. The Evening Standard,  urlLink http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/12490356?source=Evening%20Standard  says that congestion is down b 30% and traffic down by 15%. I can believe that. I know of people who now work from home more often, or now don't cut through central london on their way to work.  The Tories' argument is that it hurts business, and Norris made removing the c charge a central plank of his manifesto (dumb idea). I am not convinced that it does hurt the big central london - as argued by John Lewis- shopping venues, as I dont believe that many people drove there anyway, More credible is that the claim that small business just on the inside on the charging zone are hurting, but I am yet to see any analysis on that.  My guess is that one month into the extended zone, West Londoners will be used to the idea, after finding their area has improved.

       Respect have chosen their candidate for the Millwall by-election, called for early September:  urlLink  http://www.respectcoalition.org/index.php?ite=401&amp;rlid=17    Flying the latest flag of convenience, Paul is/has been a longstanding member of the Socialist Worker Party. There's understandably a bit of political baggage that comes with him. I particularly like this article where he tries to explain how they only got 9 votes in the last by-election on the Island he ran. It was quite an achievement given you need the signatures of ten electors to get on the ballot paper.  urlLink  http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext23/Byelec.html    I should know better than to quote secondary sources, and just in case the SWP lawyers are watching, I'll supply the link, but not reproduce the comment:  urlLink  http://www.medworth.org.uk/index.php?m=200311

       I also happen to have a season ticket for  West   Ham.  Last night was the first home game of the season. West Ham beat Reading 1-0 in what was a pretty dire game. First thoughts?  Sherringham, despite being 38, played the full 90 minutes and looked good in the air, held the ball up well, and scored the winning goal. Every first division...sorry Coca Cola Championship..team needs an old pro like him.  Rebrov played wide on the right, an unnatural position for him. He looked out of match fitness and a bit ponderous, being needlessly dispossessed on several occassions. But as someone behind me in the Upper West stand said, he scored 101 goals in 160(?) games for Dynamo Kiev, so he must have something about him.  We looked much better once Rebrov was replaced by Luke Chadwick. I've always liked Chadwick (even when he did play for Man Utd). Pardew, our manager, seems to have a thing about playing strikers out of position on the wide right; he played Harewood there all of last season. With two wide players in Etherington and Chadwick we looked far better balanced and it was only right when Chadwick's persistance supplied the winning pass to Sherrington nine minutes from time.  On defence. Bywater is becoming the best young English goalie for my money. He looked sharp, confident and assertive. Young Cohen was a liability at left back. He will be the solution to England's problem left wing position, but he isnt a natural defender. Dailly looked as good as ever. Anton Ferdinand came on with twenty minutes to go at right back and provided some good passes to Chadwick. He is becoming as a good as his brother. And Repka, depsite having other things - i.e. harrassment- on his mind looked assured.  A pretty dire performance, but Reading will be there or there abouts at the end of the season and if you can win when you play badly, it bodes well for the future.  Worth checking out is  urlLink www.kumb.com  the first and best West Ham fan's website. The match reviews provide some of the best commentary on football you can get.  We're in for another year of our hopes and dreams fading and dying I think judged on last night's performance.

        I think the Tories in Poplar must be enjoying a nice long summer break. They haven't updated their website since February:   urlLink  http://www.poplarconservatives.com       They are a constant source of amusement and entertainment.   I mean, do they really expect voters to vote for a Tory called Archer as their candidate?       And how about this?  urlLink www.poplarconservatives.com/News230104.htm  urlLink     ARCHER ATTACKS COUNCILLORS GREED....Surely this needs an apostraphe? Is he attacking a councillor, or all of them? You wouldn't have found such sloppiness under Maggie, I can tell you. Lynne Truss wouldn't like it.         I do like Timbos' official Party biography, though it does need some translation   urlLink  www.conservatives.com/people/person.cfm?PersonID=89038       "Tim lives in the heart of the constituen cy on the Isle of Dogs.." probably means a nice appartment with a view of water, not too far from Waitrose. Try telling people living in the Royal Docks that the Island is in the heart of the constituency.     "Since graduation Tim has worked for a major UK Bank " mean ctually, he's a banker.    "He is currently responsible for the day to day running of the Bank's Internet Banking Operation " actually he's a very important banker.    "Tim points out "Poplar and Canning Town has been Labour for as long as anyone can remember.." " Poplar and Canning Town was a new seat in 1997, so I suppose it is technically true what he says. Of course the Tower Hamlets Council was (disastrously) run by the LibDems in the early 1990s.

       Really, I dont know why I bother reading the Guardian. If only my newsagent would cut out the Telegraph's right wing rants/ ed-ops for me like I ask...   urlLink http://society.guardian.co.uk/localgovt/story/0,,1277823,00.html   I dont know where to start about just how wrong the facts are in here. Let's just say no-one is really quaking in their boots if Mumtaz is to help out Respect, as she alludes to.  Oh well, another by-election in the East End.  Interesting factoid: ten years ago Millwall achieved a Council turnout of 80-something percent, in response to the election of a by-election win by the BNP. Still, I think, the highest turnout in any Council election ever.

        It must be August: a comment article written by editors of the journal Renewal {readership: three people and a dog} makes the front page of the Guardian newspaper.  Their argument  I think  is that Blair has now proven himself to be a traitor to the third way, and that he has to go, to be replaced by the Gordon Brown, the lone remaining champion of social democracy in the Party. All revolutions eat themselves I suppose, but the likes of Neal Lawson and Paul Thomson really should know better than to feed the animals.  Here's an extract from the Guardian article:         "Recent events echo the collapse of the Tories: first you lose your members, then your councillor base; and finally after an epiphany (such as Black Wednesday) the fall among the wider public is frighteningly fast. Frustrated by years of neglect, clearer threats of disengagement are being made from within the unions. When sensible left-of-centre figures such as Kevin Curran {I've been thinking of switching to Amicus recently. AEEU, natch- Ed} of the GMB prophesy a break, we have to take notice."    Oh dear. Another good echo would be a successful two-term leader stands down, mired in contravery and hounded by the righ-wing press, giving his loyal but not quite so high profile deputy to run for office only for left-wing fring parties to deny him victory. Sound familiar? And look what Bush Jnr did for the US.

       Hard to believe, I know, but there's big changes happening in the kerb-laying business. There is a serious issue, to often swept under the carpet, here: the repetitive lifting of kerb stones is damaging the backs of workmen. An issue the Kerb Laying Forum (no less) has considered in depth. The following guidance note (which I reproduce in all its glory) is a gem of bureaucratic overkill:    August 2004  Briefing 04/43  To: All Chief Executives, Main Contacts and Highways contacts   Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 &amp; Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1994 Kerb Handling Operations – Local Authority Contracts; the Risk – Update from the Kerbs Forum, London, 15th July 2004 Key Issues:  HSE are not expecting every kerb laid by mechanical means but the instances where they are not will require to be accompanied by a specific risk assessment to demonstrate that no alternative method was possible. HSE do not see the use of smaller kerbs being an alternative to mechanical lifting – the cumlative stress on the operative will remain the same. Responses to draft guidance from HSE should be directed through to APSE by 27 August 2004.   1. Background In Briefing 04/26 on the kerb laying issue, it was reported that the HSE had invited APSE to send a representative (in order to improve the representation from local authority organisations) to the forum meeting in June.  This meeting which was finally held in July was arranged by the HSE to gain feedback from the industry on progress towards achieving full mechanization of kerb lifting by the January 2005 deadline.  APSE was represented at that meeting and this briefing summarises the main points raised.  2. Issues Raised The main issues raised from the presentations by Richard Bowland, HSE principal inspector and Andrew Kingscott, HSE’s inspector were as follows:- The HSE issued draft guidance (attached at end of briefing) which illustrated a hierarchy of controls HSE are not expecting every kerb in the UK to be laid by mechanical means.  However the instances where they are not will require to be accompanied by a specific risk assessment to demonstrate that no alternative method was possible. Enforcement inspections for ‘new build’ works are now in place as the June 2004 deadline has passed.  Authorities found laying kerbs on long lengths/new build sites will be contravening the Health and Safety Manual Handling Regulations 1992 and will be served with a prohibition notice and possible fine. Clear support is required from client, consultant and contractor This initiative is not only for kerbs but also: -                      Paving -                      Other work equipment -                      Loading and lifting equipment/plant onto vehicles -                      Targeting a reduction in HAV’s ·         Clients need to acknowledge the cost of investment (one unit cost approx, £15,000 each) ·         The supply chain also have a role to play by: -                      Changing specification (size, weight) -                      Pack Sizes -                      Delivery Format ·         Work protection is paramount using:- -                      Chapter 8 layouts -                      Safety Zones -                      Timing of the works -                      Deliveries  The HSE outlined what techniques they expect to be deployed within the three categories of work: Micro Roadworks (Routine Maintenance) ·         Post mounted cranes for kerbing, paving and lifting equipment on and off the vehicle ·         Post Mounted cranes with vacuum cleaner ·         Curbs cut in half (where litter cannot be utilized) ·         Grabs on JCBs Small Works ·         Vacuum Lifters ·         Best Solution – post mounted vacuum lifters Larger Works ·         Larger capacity vacuum works  The HSE were careful to emphasise that there is not a single panacea; there are a range of complementary solutions and it is up to designers and contractors to ensure that a risk assessment is carried out and the relevant process adopted.  3. Summary The following comments were answered by the HSE following questions from the floor. ·         Designers should be including specific reference within contract documentation regarding mechanical laying techniques and make it clear they should be adopted. ·         HSE do not see the use of smaller kerbs being an alternative to mechanical lifting – the cumulative stress on the operative will remain the same, ·         Contractors are advised to compile a formal action plan of how they intend to implement actions to ensure the January 2005 deadline will be met.  HSE Inspectors may ask to see this on the visit. ·         The representatives from City of London Corporation said adopting these new techniques would increase disruption, which will be increasingly sensitive with the introduction of the Traffic Management Bill imminent.  The HSE were very firm that they would not accept this point and that each scheme should be assessed on its merits and alternative arrangements adopted – e.g. road closures, night work, post-mounted units in vehicles  ·         CDM and H & S plans to mention specifically the approach to be adopted in relation to kerb lifting. ·         Research had been undertaken with Loughborough University in relation to kerb handling.  Good guidance/advice is available on website:   urlLink  www.chsg.co.uk   .  Video clips of various lifting techniques are also available on the site. ·         Sheffield City Council’s representative said that they had changed to using smaller kerbs in an attempt to reduce the need for mechanical lifters and were disappointed that they were now being told mechanical arrangements would still be required.  HSE stated that they had never given any such assurance and were adamant that mechanical lifting would still be required for smaller kerbs.  4. Comments The aim of the HSE is to move to a position “where the majority of kerbs and related products are laid using mechanical assistance” to reduce accidents (currently over a quarter of construction sector accidents are through handling).   Member authorities should be looking to carry out cost analysis of revised methods of kerb lifting and work with clients and designers to ensure that budgets compensate for any extra costs.  Additionally it will be necessary to prepare implementation plans to meet the January 2005 deadline.     The HSE have indicated they would welcome feedback on the draft guidance note (attached) by 31st August.  APSE will be submitting a response and any points that members would like to raise should be sent to   urlLink  jmarsh@apse.org.uk   .    John Marsh Principal Advisor   -------------- and as a reward for anyone reading the above --------------  DRAFT KERB LAYING Guidance from HSE  Introduction  This information sheet explains how to control the risks associated with the repetitive manual handling of kerbs and associated products.  Background  Traditionally kerbs in one form or another have been specified on the majority of roads. The standard components used are principally pre-cast concrete and weigh approximately 67kg. Feature kerbs, stone kerbs or other associated products may be considerably heavier.  The weight of the components means that there is a significant risk of injury if the kerbs are handled manually. As with the risks associated with the handling of heavy blocks, it is not only the weight but also the repetitive nature of the work can progressively lead to serious injuries.  The principal hazard is the weight of the kerb components coupled with the poor posture associated with handling kerbs manually.  This creates excessive stress and strain causing injury to muscles and tendons. These injuries are commonly referred to as Muscular Skeletal Disorders (MSDs). The risk of injury is largely determined by the weight of the kerb – the heavier the kerb the higher the risk of injury.  MSDs account for a significant proportion of accidents and injuries in construction. They are a principal reason for people having to leave the construction industry.  Risk Assessment  The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 require the employer to carry out a risk assessment for all kerb laying work. The assessment should identify what needs to be done to control the risk from handling kerbs.  When deciding what needs to be done, you may find it useful to use the following hierarchy of control measures.  You will need to show that you have used solutions from the top of the hierarchy in preference to solutions lower down.   The Hierarchy of Controls is as follows:  Elimination – Eliminate manual lifting of kerbs. (e.g. eliminate the need for kerbs during the design stage or use other construction methods such as extrusion which do not involve manual handling).  Total Mechanical Solution – Ensure kerbs are always handled and laid mechanically (e.g. fork/trailer mounted or independent vacuum lifters, positive pressure/friction grabs involving no manual effort to lift).  This will be a good solution for the majority of new build and many refurbishment works.  Partial Mechanical Solution – Ensure that part of the process of handling kerbs is done mechanically. (e.g. using mechanical solutions to get the kerb near its final position, off-loading using a hoist). The risks from manual handling can then be reduced by using smaller/lighter kerbs. The aim should be to maximise the amount of mechanical handling.  Manual Handling – In rare cases where none of the above solutions are possible, short stretches of kerb can be laid manually.  Where this is necessary you should use lighter weight products and the workers should be trained in lifting safely.   Tongs allow two people to share the weight of the lift but they do not protect the workers from injury.  The use of tongs and lighter weight kerbs should not be seen as an alternative to mechanical handling.  Precautions All of those involved in the specification, manufacture, supply, and installation of road edge details can help to reduce the risks from manual handling.  Designers, Planning Supervisors and Clients. The design and planning stage should consider: Alternative solutions to standard modular kerb products to eliminate repetitive handling Eliminating the need for kerb edgings by using a different detail or alternative techniques such as extrusion of the road edge detail Where modular kerbs have to be used, the specification should seek to use products that are compatible with mechanical handling solutions Considering the use of alternative kerb components e.g. lightweight products Identifying the risks during the lifetime of the product including issues relating to maintenance and repair Planning work to allow the maximum number of kerbs to be laid at one time to realise the economies of scale and promote the practicability of mechanical handling  Manufacturers and Suppliers  Kerb manufacturers will need to: ·        Supply kerbs in a format compatible with commonly used mechanical handling equipment ·        Ensure kerbs can be removed from the pack without the need to handle them manually ·        Clearly mark pack weights and component weights ·        Ensure, where possible pack sizes are below 1 tonne to allow handling by a wide range of commonly used site equipment  Contractors Contractors need to plan the work to ensure risk is kept to an acceptable level. This may involve:  Rethinking the phasing of the kerb installation to maximise the number of kerbs being laid at one time Laying direct from the pack rather than double handling by stringing out ahead of final laying; Using machinery capable of handling both packs and individual kerbs Using mechanical solutions for the handling of non-standard kerb details such as feature kerbs, transition kerbs, drop kerbs, quadrants (cheeses) and radius kerbs Providing for the safe storage and secure transport of kerbs Ensure that workers are trained in the safe use of mechanical lifting equipment Providing training in safe lifting techniques for workers involved with kerb laying  Mechanical kerb handling solutions Vacuum lifters A number of manufacturers produce equipment to handle kerbs using vacuum technology. The machines can be fitted with a number of interchangeable heads to allow different products to be handled.  Self-contained These devices can be either fitted on the forks of standard construction machines or mounted on trailers which allow the kerbs to be laid straight from the pack without the need to ‘string out’. Both the attachment to the kerb and the lifting force is provided by a vacuum.  Fork mounted Vacuum lifters can be mounted on standard construction lifting equipment. The advantage is that kerb laying can then be undertaken using a single machine, which carries the pack of kerbs and provides the mechanical lift. The vacuum lifter can be powered independently or by the hydraulics of the machine on which it is mounted.   Trailer mounted Trailer mounted machines offer a stand-alone handling solution that can be towed at road speeds between locations. They are useful for contactors, who lay small numbers of kerbs in multiple locations. Independent These are self-contained units, which create a vacuum to attach to the kerb. They have to be fitted to a lifting device to lift and position the load.  Grabs/Clamps A number of devices are available which clamp the kerb, either hydraulically or by friction and self-weight. Grabs have traditionally been used successfully to handle packs of kerbs and larger pre-cast components. Smaller grabs can be used to handle individual kerbs and avoid manual handling.  The grabs should be used in association with existing construction plant such as a backhoe or mini-digger to provide the lifting effort. The grabs can be used to lift the kerbs from the pack and placed directly at the point of lay minimising the manual handling input.  Return to Work Employers should consider how to manage workers who have suffered manual handling injury, in particular their return to work.  For some lower back injuries, staying mobile can assist recovery, and the affected person may be able to return to work to do lighter duties.  You should take advice from affected person’s doctor or your own company medical advisor.  Wider applications The information in this document is relevant for other precast concrete components such as drainage channels, slabs, communication ducts, copings and hard landscaping materials.

       One of my concerns is the disappearing pension schemes in the private sector. Companies that readily took 'pension holidays' (i.e. reduced payments in pension schemes) when the stock market was buoyant suddenly closed down the pension schemes when times got a little tougher. For many workers, pension schemes are wages deferred. It's good to know that the Government sees this as an  urlLink issue,  but many people would like to see stronger and firmer action on those who have already lost out.  It's understandable concerning to many people when the Government starts  urlLink looking  at the local government pension scheme, and it's good to see my own union, the GMB fielding a robust  urlLink response  to the consultation.

       A friend of mine emailed me this morning about regarding an article in yesterday's (16th August) Guardian. I reproduce the email below:   Before the last election, Tower Hamlets Fabians had the pleasure of an interesting talk from Dave Hill (later to replace Alistair Campbell but then with - I think - Bell-Pottinger). He spoke about how a second Labour term would be more radical than the first and we listened politely.  From my point of view there were few surprises, but I was interested at his reaction when  - having complained for the umpty-ninth time about privatisation - I asked whether we could expect to see in other Whitehall departments what had long been called "revolving doors" at the Ministry of Defence, whereby the minister or civil servant of yesterday becomes the highly-paid adviser to a private company. (On the other swing of the door, new grades have to be invented to accommodate the ever-higher cost of buying in private sector "expertise".)  I wondered at the time if it had touched a nerve and perhaps it did.  Today we see the latest symptoms, laid out in the attached article. In any recent era we would have been shocked, I think. Should we now just accept that much of the political class - to which we belong - is as bent as it was in the 18th Century?    And my reply to him:  What’s the evidence to suggest that new grades have to be invented to accommodate the ever higher cost of buying in the private sector ‘expertise’?  There’s actually a very good argument for strengthening the relationship between the private and the public sector rather than attempting to (and failing ) to put up a Chinese Wall between the two. The reality is that big business is always going to get the information you would prefer them not to have; the issue is whether we have a transparent and mature approach to the relationship.  One of the problems of the civil service – probably since the war- has been the lack of their experience in the real world. This makes the policy making and  decision making processes less effective than they would otherwise should be. It’s acknowledged that the French civil service, hitherto based on a no less elite academic basis than ours- the ‘enarque’ system-  has produced a more effective civil service than ours. The difference is largely due to the ‘revolving door’ (what the French call ‘pantouflage’ I believe coming from the word slipper, suggesting a cosy relationship) that you criticize between the public and the private sector.  Rather than attempting to put up rules to artificially separate the two, the reality is that both the public and the private sector would benefit from such an exchange. The public sector would start to cut through the oceans of red tape that hinder decision making & be most cost effective whilst the private sector would begin to understand why the public sector has such Byzantine rules, why decision making does take so long.  Northcote-Trevelyan was appropriate and necessary for the times. The Fulton reforms of the seventies helped somewhat. The Next Steps went someway to dragging the civil service in the 20th Century. Each reform in turn was deeply criticized at the time, and in retrospect seen as necessary.

        Taekwondo   I am just about still able to walk after a weekend Taekwon-do seminar. For the uninitiated, Taekwon-do is a Korean martial art that draws on shotokan karate and traditional kick-orientate Korean martial arts. I try to go to the  urlLink Docklands Taekwon-do school  as often as possible.  The weekend seminar was led by  urlLink Mr Jedut  a sixth degree black belt- from Poland. He brought along some of his students who helped with the demonstrations. I understand that they train three hours a day, six days a week. And it shows. Utterly awesome to watch, and at the same time extremely motivational.   Olympics     It's impossible to avoid the Olympics, but then who would want to avoid it? Good to see the South Africans in the pool defeat the Aussies (they are such good losers) and the Americans (who also know how to be gracious in defeat and modest in victory) in the mens freestyle at the weekend. And who would have thought us Brits would be so good in synchronised diving?  It raises the question of why we are so bad at sports. Certainly, the Aussies seem to have the edge over us when it comes to competitiveness and mental toughness- perhaps our softeness is the legacy of teaching non-competitiveness in schools but I think the problem lies elsewhere.  There's a sense of British (English?) fair play and sport for sports sake which I think happers us at the highest level in sport- heavens, why was Bodyline so outrageous? It was about winning ugly (years before Brad Gilbert thought of the idea). We're not good at it.  The selling off of playing fields gets a great deal of attention, but certainly the playing fields of my primary school were a (vitually) unused asset. Schools didnt celebrate sport nearly enough (although my middle school did introduce 'houses' and mine was Thompson named after the brilliant decathlete). It's really the after school sport where you get a chance to develop as an athlete, and many of the teachers stopped after school activities with the strikes in the 80s.  The loss of the works' team has surely hit us hard: gone are the days when every workplace sent out three football teams and four cricket teams on an evening. It's also still the case that we dont have enough facilities in some sports (how many velodromes do we have? How many Olympic size swimming pools?) but this is less true than it used to be: for example there are more indoor tennis courts than there used to be and far more gyms than there were ten years ago- but we are hardly up there are as a nation in tennis or weighlifting.  What can we do to reverse this decline and improve our chances of winning medals at the highest level? We need a greater pool of people playing sport. Period. How do we achieve that? That's the question.  I think the large employers need to be encouraged to promote sport within their organisations. It staggers me that there isnt a London Local Authority Games for local government employees. I am sure it would prove phenomenally popular amongst employees and residents.  Clubs too, have a responsibility. They need to be more prepared to invest time and energy cultivating youngsters. I played tennis as a very young teenager for a number of years at my local club, without a hint of encouragement from any of the senior players. With a bit of training  I could have been a contender.  Well perhaps not. But I might now be able to serve properly. Well serve at all, to be honest.
