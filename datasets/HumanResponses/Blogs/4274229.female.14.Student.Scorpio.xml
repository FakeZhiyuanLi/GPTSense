       sunny      dear diary...       just cum back from youth service, wearing that toopid blouse and skirt and courtshoe!! haha. we had a excellent time of praise and worship-(*kinda quiet tho,cause joel wasnt there to play the drums. wonder where he he went*) anyways. 2dae during Words, that uncle preached us on the 3rd purpose in life. that is, to find our purpose in life. -(*stop rollin ur eyes.*) well.it seems that in life, we have our   own purpose-(*like stardeeing.becuming a millionaire.that kinda stuff.*) and of cos, God's purpose for us. More often than not, we forsaked God's purpose for us and pursue our own purpose in life. at the end of the day, we had what we wanted -- excellent grades, lotsa money, blah blah. BUT. remove the material achievements and we'll be left with nothing. scary eh? well den. we'll have to live our life to fulfill God's purpose in our lives: to be more like Him. of cos, it is impossible to be LIKE HIM. i mean, we are NOT GOD. but. we can live our life like him. we cant be perfect, but we can try to. obviously, we cannot achieve this alone. we'll have to get help from the Holy Spirt. invit Him to remind us what to do when we haf to make a choice, and do it in a way that is most pleasing to God.hmm. so from now on, i'm gonna live to fulfill God's purpose in moi life. i'll learn to be more Christ-like. so help me along, everyone, to become a better person. =) Jesus rocks.      with lotsa love, krissy
