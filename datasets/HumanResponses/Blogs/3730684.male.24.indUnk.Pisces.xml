      So yesterday was a normal day.   I wouldn't have even turned on the iPod were it not for a quick jog out and about the new neighborhood. You see, I've just moved in to a place right outside of Cleveland, Ohio. I'm originally from right outside of Bangor, Maine, so you can understand the cultureshock I've been going through.  Anyway, as you may or may not be able to understand, I'm still trying to get used to this part of the country. In other words, I'm finally realizing that I'm truly a Northeasterner. I mean, I really can't help but be a little shocked by how unbelievably polite people are here. They, like, say "hi" when passing on the sidewalk. What the hell is that? I mean, I'm used to a nod at best. It's weird.  So anyway, I've found that when jogging, the best way to avoid this awkwardness is to simply throw on the ol' headphones and put the iPod volume on max. If you know anything about me, or if you continue to read my entries here, you'll realize that music just takes me away. Now, I don't really use it that often to escape awkward social interactions, but I certainly use it to escape the annoyances of working out.   Long story longer, as I'm running, this sugarysweet song by Lloyd Cole and the Commitments comes on. Don't know who Lloyd Cole is? Never heard of the Commitments? Well, you've got your assignment for the week. For the meantime, just assume with me that Lloyd Cole and the Commitments are awesome.  So, Lloyd Cole comes on singing about rattlesnakes. (Trust me. Sounds: Weird. Actually: Awesome). Now, this happens just as I'm jogging (albeit slowly) by a flower garden. And it hits me. The sweet smells of the flowers are actually making this syrupy song sound even more amazing. A tritely worded, nearly entirely forgotten tune from the 80s now sounds like pure genius. So this gets me thinking...  Would Einst√ºrzende Neubauten sound better in a stank old turbine factory? Would Tool sound better while getting your ass kicked? Would Britney Spears sound better with sixteen thousand fewer brain cells? Or is it just the mix of the senses? As I'm running, I realize that it is quite obviously this mix of the senses that makes music more powerful.  Why is MTV so popular? (or, since there are little in the way of actual videos shown on MTV why are music videos, when actually shown, so popular)?  I think my simple observation answers that question pretty conclusively. We, as humans, like more than just sense stimulated. Why do you find so many sex mixes at  urlLink artofthemix.com ? Because we like the sights  and  the sounds  and  the smells  and  the feelings stimulated. As many at once as possible.  We like to mix the aural with the tactile as much as we like mixing the aural with the visual and the olfactory.   Damn. If only we could taste those notes.

      1. You must be passionate about the music you choose  2. Create a mood. The mood can vary, but you cannot be haphazard about ordering your tracks. Yes, it is possible to make a mix with both Bob Dylan and Outkast... it's just very tricky to put them next to each other.  3. The first three songs  must  be great songs and they need to fit together well. Lapses in a mix's flow are more easily tolerable in the middle of the disc. As for the first 3 songs, number 2 is, by far, the key. The number 2 song can absolutely make or break your entire mix.  4. Never put the first song of any album on your mix. Advanced mixmakers may break this rule in certain circumstances...  **NOTE- it is  ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE  to make the first song of an album the first song of your mix** Not even advanced mixers may break this rule. To commit this offense is both an insult to the art of the mixtape and rude to the listener. If I put in a CD and hear "Smells Like Teen Spirit" I had  best  be listening to  Nevermind , not to some mix by an asshole who thinks he is good enough to open his stupidass mixtape with that track.  5. Mixing vocal and instrumental music is best left to advanced tapemakers. This is possible but not recommended until several acceptable mixes have been made. Furthermore, it is recommended that pure jazz mixes be avoided. Ken Burns compiled a boxed set of jazz music and was 1 for 5. This is a formidable task and you are likely to fail.  6. "So What" by Miles Davis cannot appear on your mix. This is a sacrilege. "So What" belongs on  Kind of Blue . It does not belong anywhere else. This is, perhaps, the greatest piece of recorded sound that ever will be. You are pathetic if you think it belongs on your mix. Hell, that song was not supposed to be heard by human ears, and, frankly, it does not even belong here on earth. It belongs on the iPod of the angels. Do ont embarass yourself by putting in on a mix and then winding up in the burning pits of Hell for all eternity. It's not worth it.  7. No band or artist may have more than 2 songs on one mix. In fact, only one band or artist may enjoy this privilege on any one disc. We are not listening to a S.D.R.E. greatest hits album, so don't make it sound that way. Furthermore, opening your tape with a track by the same artist you close with is a risky move. This can create a wonderful parallelism in sound, or a magnificent cheesiness.  8. Listen to the mix before you finish it. Be sure songs fit together. If you really want to impress folks with your disc, make a rough draft and modify it. Do you really think  The Great Gatsby  was written all in one sitting with no editing? Of course not. Don't assume you're good enough to make a mix that way.  9. Be careful using popular songs. However, sometimes throwing on a well-known-but-not-too-well-known track is just the way to go. Even better is a lesser known cover of a popular song.  10. Know your audience. If you're making a mix for you, this is easy. If it's for a chick or dude you think is cute but are just getting to know, stay away from anything too suggestive. Hey, a mix is really an unconscious statement of your wants & desires. Espeically in this situation. Be careful!  11. Try to keep away from repeats if you're making more than one mix for someone. And definitely when you're making them for yourself. Yeah, sure, "Soft serve" by Soul Coughing is a ridiculously underrated tune, but don't put it on every mix you give out.  12. Share. Even if you are simply making a mix for you, you should let others hear it. Alright, maybe there are those few that are  just  for you... but music is for sharing and so are mixes. And if you don't wanna' make people feel obligated to comment, just put it on in the background. If it's a good mix, people will comment. If it's horrible, they'll make you shut it off... and if it's mediocre, they won't say anything. Of course, this only holds true with folks who have good taste in music (or at least tastes similar to yours). Can the Velvet Underground's "Heroin" be put on a mix? Absolutely. Are some people going to tell you to shut it off, even if it's perfectly placed? You bet.  RT

      Perhaps this should be started with a manifesto.  I am Tom Geaghan, alternately known as Ron Thomas. Yeah. It sounds like a porno name. Whatever. It's also a better DJ name than Tom Geaghan, and as such I have generally applied it to all of my music-type work.  So, who cares, right? Well, you should. Why? Because this site is about the reader. I want to answer your questions, fuel your debates, and generally be a snob on y'all's asses by telling you what I think, know, and most importantly feel about music. (Specifically of the pop/rock/alternative/indie kind) Of course, not everything contained in here will be directly related to any one type of music, but as in life, it will always be there somewhere. In the backgroud, the middleground, the foreground. Whatever.  So this is where you come in. Send me music questions. Send me music opinions. Send me music challenges. Ask me to make tough music decisions and chastise me when you don't agree with my opinions. That'd be kickass.  R.T.
