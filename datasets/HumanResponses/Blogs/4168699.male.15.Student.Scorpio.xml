      Hmm....today i got up at about 9ish to the sound of the plumber tearing up the basement floor....well i talked online for a little while, not much to talk about....then i went to my church to pick up a LiveStrong wristband for myself, its pretty cool....i then proceeded to go to the Wheel N Sprocket store to look at odometers, all to expensive though, so i decided to not get one...came home, watched some little league world series, some of those kids are pretty damn good...so i did some other random stuff around the house and outside...went to pokers at an old friends house, good night, went up 30 bucks, all various sorts of poker, just not hold'em, omaha high, 4's n whores, 5 card draw, 7 card no peak, and guts....after that i came home and did other random stuff, and here i am now...later

      So today in church i was just sitting there, trying to listen, looking around and i noticed about five people or so w/yellow wristbands on, including the pastor....in the sports section a few days before today, there was a brief article about yellow wristbands put out by the lance armstrong foundation to help fight cancer...the wrist bands have been becoming pretty popular and george w. and john kerry even have ones themselves....so after mass i asked the pastor where he had gotten his from, and if it was infact a lance wristband, it was one, and he said he got it from his office, he offered me to come on down to his offisce later on this week to pick one up....so anywho i got home and went to  urlLink www.wearyellow.com  to find out even more about these famed wristbands...they're all backordered due to popularity, but i ordered a 10 pack...idk its just something about these little yellow pieces of plastic that just inspire me to work hard and do things to full extent...just like lance armstrong...so, i only have a couple left to give away after i get them in mid august...so if you want one, comtact me, see my profile for more info...so yah after all that whoohaa i went for a bike ride feeling so inspired and i rode for about 2 hours...not really any good sports on today coinsidering i find nascar boring..um did some other stuff i cant remember, read a little, oh watched meet the parents on USA, talked on the computer here for a while, worked outside, all that fun stuff...so yah lesson of the day, go to wearyellow.com and get inspired...later

      "Yarghhh" yelled Stramboli against the gushing waves of the Topeka River. "Get a frickin branch or something Stewie", "I'm about to drown." "I'm working on it Stram, I'm working!" shouted Stewie to his friend in peril. Stramboli and Stewie had been friends for about 10 years now, and knew eachother like the backs of their palms. They were both 15 years old and lived life very nonchalantly. They lived in a mountanious area surrouned by mountains of coure and many trees and waterfalls. Everyday they would go out into the mountains exploring, and today Stramboli happened to fall into the river. The current was strongly pulling him towards the 20 story high death trap, the Topeka Waterfall! "You dunce!" screamed Stewie "how the hell did you manage to fall into the frickin river?!" Stewie threw a long branch at Stramboli as he was yelling. Stramboli grabbed on and pulled himself up to shore sputtering out mangled phrases. "Gahgbag I'm ok." Stramboli was very flustered and needed to lay down for awhile before speaking again. But before he could do so, something started flopping around in Stramboli's pants. "My God" muttered Stewie. Stramboli reached into his pants and pulled out a whopping big fish. "Looks like I caught myself dinner!" yellped Stramboli in utter disbelief. The boys decided to start on home sharing their story about the river adventure with eachother, each time adding another part that was not mentioned before. As they were walking, the boys ran into a freakin huge bear! The boys both screamed "Jee Wilikers", and ran for their lives.
