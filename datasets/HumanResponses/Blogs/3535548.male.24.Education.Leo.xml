      I'd forgotten all about today until I got to work.  Damn.  I had such a nice weekend, I put the whole thing out of my mind.  I work with this woman.  She's an awful teller.  Every five minutes she's calling me over to override a correction because she messed up a transaction.  She never proves at the end of the day.  Ever.  On Saturday morning, I realized why.  She's an older woman - in her fifties, I'd say.  Has that kind of bar fly way about her.  Smokes a lot.  Smokers' laugh.  And, as I realized on Saturday, alcoholic.    When I got close enough to her the other day, I smelled booze on her breath.  Not cough syrup; not mouthwash.  It smelled like moonshine.  It was definitely something hard.  And it was at 8:30 in the morning.  So I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, saying that I'd never noticed it on her before (not that I often go sniffing her mouth) and maybe she was just out to have a good time the night before (which was a Friday).  I was going to talk to her about it in private.  That's what Stephen and I had decided, and Stephen is always good for advice on touchy subjects.  I didn't smell anything on her breath this morning, so I figured I'd just let it go.  But in the afternoon, I got near her again and smelled booze on her again, which means that she was drinking on her lunch break.  Jesus I hate the fact that I even know this.  It explains why she can't balance to save her life, and I noticed that her hands are shaky today.  I guess the plan will be to just pull her aside on Thursday when I see her next and tell her she has to do something about this.  I know that if I tell either of my bosses, she'll get fired, and I wouldn't want that.  My head hurts.  I have to read about a hundred pages for my new class, which I don't even have time to write in here about.  Jeez.  Goodnight.

      I love Sundays.  I swear that my body has some internal mechanism that blocks out my alarm clock from waking me up.  It probably was blaring at seven this morning because I know that I was too tired to remember to shut it off last night when I got home.  I woke up sometime around 11:30 and smiled, knowing I wasn't late for work today.  So I checked my email after I woke up and saw that I'd gotten a message from a girl on this Jewish dating website that I signed up for a few days ago.  So I logged in to read it.  Now, I'm not a paying member, but apparently you have to be a paying member to not only send messages, but to reply to them, too.  And it's $35 a freaking month!  What kind of bullshit is that?  At first, I told myself, "Guess this one's not happening."  When my mom made me French Toast for breakfast (I guess one of the few good things about living at home again), I mentioned it to her.  She said I should sign up and that she would pay the membership fees.  At first, I said no, based on principle.  I mean, paying those exorbitant fees is inane.  But forcing   two   people to pay that much money?  That's like the cost of a whole evening, right there!  And this is supposed to make you feel good about dating other Jews?  Blech.  But when I thought about it, the girl is cute, seems like a nice person, and it would have been rude of me to ignore her, especially when my mom was willing to pay for it.  So I caved.  But not before attempting so send this girl an encrypted message by putting my instant messenger name in my profile.  It didn't work.  The credit card came out of my wallet.  Now, last night.  Last night was fucking funny.  Like, REALLY funny.  It was Scotty Ho's birthday, and his eclectic friends get together every year and go out into the city for his birthday.  His friends are mostly...well...let's call them what they are - geeks.  It's so much fun to watch them all get drunk.  To them, alcohol is still like the forbidden fruit and they seem to pretend to be drunk after about a half of one drink.  There was this one girl that I wanted to go up to and talk to, but she was sitting at the bar and about three or four of her friends were circled around her.  They were part of a bachelorette party.  It was like they were protecting her.  From me.  I guess one thing I could tell right away about her - she's got pretty good friends.  They all left before I could muster up the balls to talk to her.  Oh well.  But what happened later made it all worth it.  Three people from Scott's party went home.  I took the subway, and Paul, Liz, and Ray all left after I did and took a cab.  They spotted me on the train, so I sat with them.  Then, we thought we saw the girls from the bachelorette party near us on the train.  But now the lights were bright and they all looked like sloppy messes.  It was like that scene in "Spaceballs" where they capture the stunt doubles.  We kept on saying that we were going to talk to them, but they were drifting in and out of consciousness so we just left them alone.  They really looked like the girls from the bar after a bad coke binge and one was even holding a "bachelorette" tiara.  Then, when they got up for their stop, one of them was wearing a white linen skirt with a HUGE piss stain right on the backside of it.  The four of us almost had piss stains of our own after seeing that.  So we had to ask them where they'd been, that we might have seen them.  One said, "A male strip club."  We just walked away from them after that.  Funny.  Really Funny.  The girl from the jewish dating website IM'd me a little while ago.  I'll write more soon about how this is heading...

      This is really the lowpoint of my procrastination - setting up a blog.  I'd been meaning to set one up for a while, but I have a whole bunch of crap to do today and I don't want to do any of it.  I just moved back into my parents' house (hopefully) just for the summer.  I had a sweet apartment on top of a hardware store with two other guys, but since I'm looking for a teaching job, I'd rather get a place close to wherever the school I work at is.  The lease on the place ended last week and I convinced my parents to not leave me homeless on the street.  They love me.  My old bedroom in their house is a dump.  I'd painted the walls a really cool shade of green, but they painted it disgusting canary yellow after I left.  The place looks like the bedroom of a manic-depressive who thinks painting the walls a cheery color will make them happy.  They also turned the room into a storage closet.  You would think that an old married couple like them who have a whole house wouldn't have enough useless sundries to fill every room of every house, but they do.  Even the basement.  So I had to rent a storage locker for my stuff, but ended up getting an even bigger one to put   their   crap in, too.  That's what I'm supposed to be doing with my day - moving the stuff over to the storage locker.  Well...I guess it's cheaper than paying rent somewhere.  It's what I keep telling myself.  It makes me feel better.  I guess it's not so bad, since I'll never be home, anyway.  I work full-time and I'll be taking summer classes.  My days, at least for the next month, will be mostly comprised of waking up at 7:30 to go to work, then straight to school, and getting home around 9:30 at night.  It's probably better that way.  Keeping busy is good.  I should probably start being productive.  We'll see how this blog thing works out.
