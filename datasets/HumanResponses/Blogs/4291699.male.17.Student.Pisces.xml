      I will begin by introducing myself. My name is Cory. Despite the signature you will see on the bottom, it is Cory. I just think the name Jonas is hot. Laughter. Now, to explain what this is about. In correspondence with my good friend Anthony P. and through my own research we shall point out the inconsistencies of todays Politics and Religion, in hopes that they might read this page, (laughter) and correct the problems we point out. We shall also offer our opinions on the media, Corporate America, and so forth. Today, I shall begin with a story i read about in my local newspaper, Newsday. It is entitled:  Ill Girl Has Rite Denied . Now, just so you are not confused, we are talking about the Rite of Communion. It is a Catholic tradition in which the reciever eats a small piece of unleavened bread to symbolize Jesus Christ's Last Supper, which is called the 'Body of Christ,' or 'Host'. They also drink wine, symbolizing the 'Blood of Christ.' Now this particular article focuses on a little girl, named Haley Waldman. Haley is a normal 8-year-old girl, with one exception. She has a genetic disorder called Celiac Sprue Disease. This disorder makes the affected person highly intolerant to gluton. Now, the Roman Catholic Church has certain doctrine which states that the 'Host' must contain "Unleavened Wheat," to symbolize the bread that Jesus ate. Haley's Family is Roman Catholic and attempted to have her recieve her Communion with a Rice Host in place of a Wheat Host. The Diocese in which Haley resides has declared this void, meaning that she did not recieve Communion, and has not made a major step of growing up in her faith. Now, to clear up something before i go any further, i am an Atheist. I do not 'Beleive' in Heaven, or Hell for that matter. But i  DO  beleive in Freedom of Religion. If this little girl wants to become closer to her God, then let her. Let her have the Rice Host. The Catholic Church has made these rules, not God himself. These are man made rules. Rules can be broken, even had an exception made, to accomodate the Faithful. If the Church can say that a man who lived his life as a sinner and at the last moment of his life repent and except God, and he is forgiven and welcomed into Heaven, why can't an 8-year-old-girl be given the chance to show her faith? Even the Catholics own Messiah stated "Suffer the Children Unto Me." What happened to that??? Did the Church just forget about it? But this little girl understands what is happening, she knows that if she eats the Wheat Host, she could very well die. But now, if she dies, could the Church not be charged with murder of her body here on Earth??? And when they arrive at the Pearly Gates, could they not be charged with the killing of a child??? On top of that, these rules are nearly 2 thousand-years-old. They did not foresee this kind of situation. So, why not just let the girl have get away with it??? I mean, the Church let hundreds of priests get away with touching the children, am I not correct??? I for one plan on supporting this little girl as best i can, by speaking my mind out against these inconsistencies. Hey, and dont forget, this  COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!!!!
