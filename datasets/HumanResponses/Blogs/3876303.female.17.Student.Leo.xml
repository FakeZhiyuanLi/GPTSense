      Saying goodbye to friends I've had for three and six years is not an easy thing, but, it is...a relief. Have you ever had a childhood friend that you just grew apart from? I have moved beyond the scope of my closest friends, and it's felt like they're holding me back for a long time. I know I'm gonna miss them, but on the other hand, I can grow and move on in my new life. I can focus on new friends, who are on the same wavelength...and I can do so much more. I don't feel trapped or misunderstood anymore. I don't feel so alone, either, which is strange, since I'm saying goodbye to my friends. Any advice?

      Yay!&nbsp; I got an early birthday present from this guy I've known forever, and it was Petshop of Horrors volume 7.&nbsp; I love Count D!&nbsp; It's my favorite manga, and he's my favorite character.&nbsp; &nbsp; The guy that bought it for me is an annoying little pariah, but he means well.&nbsp; My family hates him, and HE IS NOT MY BOYFRIEND!!&nbsp; Sorry, but my mom's been giving me shit, and I hate it.&nbsp; Sometimes I hate him,&nbsp; but, he buys me things.&nbsp; Anyway, nuff said for now.&nbsp;

      hey...Life is so dull and boring right now, there's no time to go say my goodbyes to my friends, what with packing and all. I haven't told you, have I? My mother is getting married and moving to Belize. I am moving to Wyoming to live with my grandparents while they put me through college early. I knopw my mom loves me, but why must she be such a royal b****? Why must she hate me for having friends online? I can't believe how horrible she can make me feel. Sometimes, I just wish I could be on my own, ya know? Sure, the responsibilities are huge, but you're allowed to be your own person.

      Hey all, I'm at my mom's, hogging her computer, just so I can write this. Heehee... anyway, I just got an excellent email about Advent Children. I almost died... They've done a very good job...except on Sephy. That, I am not pleased with; they made him ugly! Besides this, I just finished Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. I saw the movie a thousand times, but the book is infinitely better. I can't believe how Hollywood always manages to butcher any work of minimal or major excellence they get their hands on. It's sickening. In other news....I now know why I always feel suffocated when at my mother's, and I with all my moving and whatnot, I know why I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff, waiting to fall. Great, I just got screamed at by my mother. I can't wait until I'm out of here, and I don't have to put up with her bullshit favoritism. I can't believe what a bitch she is when I'm around... Nevermind, none of you care anyway.

      Today I checked my email at the college, and to my absolute joy, I had two very flattering, very sincere reviews for a series of short-story fanfics that I had begun posting yesterday.  I am currently typing up the next installment, and I hope I get more such reviews.  I love praise, since it is so very rare for me, and I can honestly say that this is one of my better days.  I got my research paper back early for the summer course I just finished today, and to my further happiness, I got a B+.    I hope I get some feedback, since I am used to criticsm and comments.  I will probably post again today, but for now, I have nothing else to say.  When next y'all hear from me, I'll be at my mom's in Colorado, packing my bags to move in with granma and grampa permanently.

      July 8, 2004:  I have finally decided to begin a blog, and in doing so, keep up with the Nikkis and Erins in my life.  I am not sure what I should write, in the hopes of maintaining the interest of fellow bloggers, but I will make an effort.  First off: I am sixteen and in college.  Seriously.  When it's time for fall semester, I will be seventeen, but I am enrolled now and have my final day of my first course tomorrow.  I am an English major, and if I seem too verbose, let me know.  Life for me is misery and depression, and I absolutely adore my mother.  Yep... adore ...  I have nothing else to say right now, so I will get off the library computer I am battering with my stubby little fingers and let someone else web surf for God only knows what.
