      yo! today is another day.....albeit a fluffy muffy one. im so glad to be home and lazing about but i just found out that (surprise surprise) our house is falling apart! yeah theres this big freakin crack in the wall! isnt that great? *bangs head on stuff* *sigh* so yeah that sux majorly, but on top of that we have an earwig infestation! some of you may know them as silverfish. but thats stupid. cause  they are neither silver nor fish. my comp is being stupid! my ipod finally  has songs on it again! (thank god!) but the comp itself is evil. it wont launch stuff that needs to be launched and neverwinter nights is going way way way too slowly! *cries* my new kitten, Gizmo, is chasing my old cat, Beezer out of the house on an hourly basis and mom says we cant keep letting him run away from a little baby girl kitten! i dont know what to do bout that. why cant beezer be the dominint (sp?) one and show gizzy that hes the power cat in the house? hes a wuss. (sry bezzey but you are) i have four online mangas that i want to read, but its so  hard to keep track! today i plan on doing nothing. so thats good but tomorrow me and mom and peter and kathy and kathys  mom and maybe sam and maybe a few other friends of mine are going to see the village! yanno that really scary new movie by m. night shaliman (sp?) i cant wait but im gonna be soooo freaked out! as always with scary movies *thinks of the ring* *shudders* *screams* *dies* *becomes ghost* *gets reincarnated as alissa* yeah so ill see some of you eventually....or not *look of intrigue* god im an idiot! ttyl all! oh and happy birthday to harry potter! july 31! ok im a geek i know....
