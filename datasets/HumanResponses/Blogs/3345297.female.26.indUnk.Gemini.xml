      For someone who is usually average when it comes to cooking, I make excellent spaghetti with homemade sauce. Go, me! ;) I also put together a nice salad this evening 'cause I love to do that when I have the time (and remember to purchase all the veggies).  So, my stomach is happy. :) I also cleaned, went for a walk, and had some time to read. I'd stay up all night goofing off if I didn't have to work early. I'll earn myself some money, then relax in the evening and have Wednesday free. Must do some more editing then!

      I worked hard to get to this day off, and now there are chores to deal with. They're better than boredom, so I'll turn on some music and have them over in no time! (I hope.)   T minus twelve days!

      Okay, I think I may understand some of this whole "free will vs. omniscience" issue. I found a  urlLink loooong article  from Dennis Bratcher and I got the most from the last section, An Incarnational God. So here's how I think it goes (and I'm not saying I've wrapped my brain around all the possibilities yet):  Definitions of God that use the "omni" words tend to limit Him. They arose from a desire to answer the question "What is the nature of God?" A better understanding of who He is (that is supported more fully by Scripture) comes when we ask "How can I get to Heaven?" because that's when we explore the relationship between God and mankind.  The gist of the whole issue is that God chose to give us freedom, not  forcing  us to follow the rules but allowing us our own decisions, even if we may not use this free will for good. He  could  have made us unable to depart from His will, but I suspect that He wanted something much more fulfilling for us all. See, if we do choose to obey Him, we see all kinds of blessings and learn all manner of wonderful things about our Creator, our Saviour, our Lord. If we had no choice, we would experience neither lows nor highs.  I like Bratcher's analogy of God being the pilot in our boat, on the river of life. God warns us of dangerous currents and obstacles to avoid, but we choose how to navigate. Maybe we won't listen to His advice, and we'll steer toward the danger. The choice is up to us, but He sees the  possibilities .  I also believe that God can make beautiful things come out of tragedy, but He didn't make that disaster happen. To take an example from my current job in a deli: When there's a shortage in one of my supplies, I will often find alternatives so that I can still do my work properly. That doesn't mean I wanted the shortage to happen or that I caused it to occur, I simply have the ability to carry on and make something out of a less than ideal situation.  I realise that example doesn't cover all the bases, but it can get a person thinking of similarities between their everyday life and the bigger picture of God working with us. Even though my brain might get tired of attempting to understand, I don't believe God wants us to be in the dark. When we appreciate that He gives us choice and freedom, we are closer in our relationship with Him. (And I think everyone has a relationship, whether we choose to disown Him or ignore Him or seek to know Him better.)  Whew, so profound for me that I need a break! ;)

      Well, I'm working  through  the weekend. I have two evening shifts to do, then Sunday as well. Haven't seen the next schedule, but I'm assuming my boss has taken pity on me and given me Monday to run free.  I have new  urlLink library  books for my breaks and then my spare time at home. I'm going to start with  urlLink Princess in the Spotlight  and then I've got  urlLink The Cat Who Saw Red  and  urlLink The Cat Who Played Brahms . I also couldn't resist  urlLink Tempest at Stonehaven . (Mine's not the large print, but that's the only entry Amazon.com has.)  I'm on Chapter Fifteen (that's the last one!) for editing, and then I have to compare an old paper copy of the story with my computer file to make sure they both match. After that, I must tackle any unresolved issues, of which I seem to have a bunch. I'm not sure how long that last step will take, but I'm excited that this is the most work I've ever done on one story. Who knew I could it?

      Check out  urlLink Sam Roberts  and  urlLink Fefe Dobson . Also, the latest CD from  urlLink Avril Lavigne  is pretty good.  Time to get outdoors for a walk (with my CD player along so I continue to listen to good tunes). Hopefully, the rain will stay away while I'm out.

      Someday, I'd like to have a  urlLink laptop . Not just because I've drooled over them for years, but for those days when I'm sore or tired and would love to put my feet up, yet still be online.   Until that magical day in the future, I'll find ways to get around the fact that my desktop doesn't allow me to fully rest my back and legs. Yesterday, I realised I could print out some emails and type up responses later - not everything online must be read or replied to as soon as it hits my inbox (though that's my natural urge).  So, anyway, the plan worked last night, and I got another chapter edited while resting. "Brava!" for me. :)  I'm waiting for a phone call this morning, but I'm sure I could find something to accomplish at the same time. (I'm awfully good at wasting away my days, and I don't even want to excel in that area.) Off I go to clean or organise!

      Rain has been in the forecast for a few days and I think we got a little today. It's the cloudiness and the uncertainty that's thrown me off this afternoon - I took a nap, which I rarely ever need. I am an adult, after all, and usually sleep well.  Most advertisements don't get to me, but McDonald's sunk their hook in with the adult Happy Meal. (Go active!) I wanted one of those stepometers like crazy (and yes, I am aware the real thing is called a pedometer). Now I'll know how far I walk during work and when I get outside. The salad I had to buy to get the gadget was actually really tasty, but I'm sure it's much cheaper to make my own. Thanks anyway, Mickey Dee's.  I think I'll be listening to music more, or revisiting my video collection - TV's Rerun Season (aka the summer) has begun. I'm just waiting for the last "Gilmore Girls" and then the Stanley Cup Finals. Yep, I'm addicted to the "boob tube." Summer is my rehab but then I fall right back into the trap come fall. ;) I guess it's possible I'll get more writing done if my brain isn't full of TV shows....  Time to edit Chapter Eleven!

      Okay okay, I'm just kidding. Put down your weapon of choice and chill. ;) I just want to record the fact that my kitchen is clean, the laundry is almost done for the week, and I mopped the floor too. And now I'll return to my role as the writer of the house.  A few musical notes today:  1. It's easy sometimes to sing at church without thinking much about the lyrics of the hymns. Today,  urlLink Living For Jesus  was more than a song to me, very much a prayer.  2. If you've never heard  urlLink Jars of Clay  before, I recommend  urlLink Much Afraid . Actually, any disc of theirs is great. :)  3. Another good band (playing in my stereo as I type this) is  urlLink Plumb . I have their  urlLink self-titled tape .  All right, time to do some editing!

      Okay, there are more exciting activities than hanging out in a mall, but I don't do it often and so it's still really fun. :)  Two of my mum's friends were in town on a tour of Eastern Canada, so I showed them a bit of Fredericton. They expected it to be a bigger city, but were less disappointed than glad the day would be quieter than the rest of their trip. (They came from my small hometown,  urlLink Castlegar , so it's not like it was the tiniest city they've encountered.)  Being ladies, we had to hit the mall for a bit. :) I found a bargain on a couple items that have been marked down a few times, so I now have a new skirt to wear to church tomorrow - it's almost 12:30 am but I'll still count this as Saturday night - and I have a new carry-on suitcase as well. (I love to travel!)  I meant to do some editing tonight but slacked off instead. I saw "Van Helsing" (okay for a Dracula flick) and "Timeline" (awesome, IMHO). Tomorrow, I will print off another chapter of my novel and check it over. Honest.

      I doubt that anyone who reads this will have seen the movie, but I enjoyed "New York Minute." I thought it would a cheesy kids' flick 'cause it's got Mary-Kate and Ashley, but it turned out to be funny and entertaining. At least to me, that is. Maybe I'll watch it again this weekend, when I try to catch up on a bunch of other shows I wanted to see.  I'm making some herbal tea. Wanna join me for a cuppa?

      This isn't a sermon, just the tale of a personal revelation:  While checking out a friend's online journal, I read some nasty comments about my country. Naturally, I was offended.  And then I thought of the times when I had given a slight dig against my friend's homeland. Doh, guess I'm not so innocent either. I'm sure  he would be ticked off, too.  When I watch the news, and see politicians from both sides doing stupid things or yakking on about how one country is so much greater or smarter or moral than the other, I'm going to keep in mind that generalisations hurt people. And I don't need to hurt anyone to be patriotic.

       urlLink Tony Vincent  provides the soundtrack for this post. (Buy his CDs, they're awesome!)   Just got off the phone with my mother. She has an inside look at the process of writing a novel, thanks to the only creative present I've given her in years: a notebook with some of my insights and conundrums about writing fiction.  Tonight, her writing advice (she's a painter, BTW, not an author) was about description. As soon as I heard the word, I said, "Mum, I suck at description!" (Thank goodness, she didn't scold me on the use of that word. Yes, mum, your vacuum sucks. Tee hee.)  She persevered, telling me that description would really help the story. I defended my lack of skill by pointing out that many stories do well without focusing on descriptions of every object in the tale. And then she gave me a great way to boost the scenes: think of things from my own life.   For instance, in one character's apartment, Mum wants to know something about the chair. Without deep thought, I asked, "What room is it in?" You see, I know what kind of furniture is in the living room, 'cause it feels natural to picture my own comfy chair (which happens to be a freebie, thank you very much) as being within the financial constraints of said character. The colour, a shade between brown and beige, fits the drab, non-decorating mood of the character at that point of the tale. Et voil&#224;, her apartment is now more interesting to my mother!  I now have a tool when it comes to the dreaded process of describing the imaginary world I create: more visualisation. And I feel ready to take on the world with this secret weapon! LOL

      I have a new resolution, thanks to a purchase I shouldn't have made. I hate bathroom scales - the numbers rarely match my hopes - yet it's true that seeing how much one has gained over the winter months (and for me, spring as well) can bring about better eating habits. As long as one doesn't become too depressed first....  Since last summer's diagnosis of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), I've learned that healthy eating improves my mood. Unfortunately, I didn't put that knowledge into practice once the weather turned cold. I stayed inside, hating to subject myself to winter winds and not even missing the exercise much. And then my obsession with "sweets" took over!  But enough of the past, on to the future. Here's my pledge: I will find my sugar fix in fruits and other nutritious foods, plus I'll take advantage of opportunities to exercise. (In other words, I won't let good weather go to waste, and I'll be less of a wimp on the other days!)  I already feel better, and I hope this will bring back a desire to write. If it starts with journaling and expands from there, I'm all for it!  All right, time to get some orange juice (sugar, please!) and grab the hard copy of chapter nine of my novel. The rest of this year is going to be productive, I promise.

      I had to work day shift this weekend, but I still managed to fit in three movies ( urlLink Little Women ,  urlLink Rudy , and  urlLink Police Academy ) and spend time with my husband. We even played cribbage by candlelight during a power outage Saturday night.  And now it's Monday, a whole day off after five shifts in a row. (That doesn't happen often, so I've become accustomed to a lighter schedule and may sound like a wimp for desperately needing this time at home.) I have housecleaning to do - since I tend to neglect it on workdays - and I'm still near the beginning of Dee Henderson's  urlLink True Honor  as a result of less reading time in the past week.  And I  must  get outside for at least one walk today. The evil scale in my bathroom reveals that my ten pounds of winter padding have become twenty this spring. I need to be more active! (I also received some advice on dealing with my sugar cravings from one of my sisters. She'll be studying nursing next year and already seems to know a lot about healthy eating. I'll be turning to the natural sugars found in fruits so I get nutrients as well, rather than loading up on ice cream and chocolate - my dangerous friends.)  All right, I better get to the To Do list in my head before the hours get away from me!

      Dirty dishes beckon from the kitchen, but I would rather write. I'm glad for this change, even though it might be partly motivated by the fact that I can sit as I write, while dishwashing requires a standing position.  I didn't feel bone-tired until I had to wait in a line-up to buy supper ingredients before coming home. Besides the physical fatigue, I was longing for my husband's company. I had "done my time," as I sometimes say about work, and yet my freedom was delayed.   Do I have an unreasonable need to be in complete control of my time off? I bet I do; delays and wasted time are probably at the top of my list of pet peeves.  Now that I'm in my apartment, I feel much better. I am in the presence of someone who genuinely cares about turning my sour mood into a good one (and his methods are working, I must say). He seems to have missed me today, and that warms my heart much more than being free of endless queues in the grocery store or slow drivers on the way home....  God is good to me!

      I love to sign up for things. Freebies, contests, accounts at game websites... and online journals. But can I take this latest registration of mine and turn it into something serious and long-lasting?  Maybe all the hype about journaling will prove to be true. I could get out my thoughts about life here, and what's left will be a creative flow into the stories I like to create.  Here's hoping!

      Finally found the time to watch "Spartacus." With that ending, not something I'll watch often, but it wasn't awful either.   urlLink "Calendar Girls"  was very good. Loved the landscape and the accents and the whole concept!  My short story is finished and I should be able to post it here soon. BTW, when one is typing a story while watching TV, one should always proofread - one sentence had about half the letters wrong because my right hand wasn't on the correct keys, according to the QWERTY typing method. LOL, that looked funny.  Just started "Grace At Bender Springs" and have to write a review of "The Church Ladies" soon. (Lisa Samson deserves a bit of my time for that gem of a novel!) I think I'll re-read the Harry Potter books next, since we own the set - I love taking my time, not worrying about due dates at the library. Then again, the library membership is free! (Always a good thing in my mind!)  Have a great Wednesday, everyone!

      I shouldn't be surprised when the sequel to a good Disney cartoon isn't as spectacular. Yet I was still unhappy when I saw  urlLink "Atlantis: Milo's Return"  last night. Oh well, some movies are just duds.  On the bright side, we watched both  urlLink "Toy Story"  movies afterwards and weren't disappointed. (Although they could have done without the singing in the second one, the movie did have the same sense of adventure as the original.)  This morning, I'm listening to  urlLink The Best of Leann Rimes  while I update all my Gentoo applications. I s'pose I could get out for a walk too, before work, but the sun is hiding and I'm feeling lazy. ;)  For the bookworms out there, I gushed a bit yesterday about a book I'd finished. My review of "The Blue Castle" is on iVillage.com's  urlLink Christian Bookshelf . I hope to post a review of "The Church Ladies" sometime soon. (Just started it last night, then became distracted by the movies.)  Speaking of fiction, I've been avoiding the typing I need to do to have my fantasy short story finished. Also haven't thought about going back to the editing for my novel. I have Monday and Tuesday off work, though, so I'll make the time then.  All right, I'm going to get my exercise before rain descends over Freddy Beach again. (Where did summer go?)

      The Jordan is waiting for me to cross through  My heart is aging I can tell  So Lord, I'm begging for one last favor from You  Here's my heart take it where You will   This life has shown me how we're mended and how we're torn  How it's okay to be lonely as long as you're free  Sometimes my ground was stoney  And sometimes covered up with thorns  And only You could make it what it had to be  And now that it's done  Well if they dressed me like a pauper  Or if they dined me like a prince  If they lay me with my fathers  Or if my ashes scatter on the wind  I don't care   But when I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbye   There's people been friendly, but they'd never be your friends  Sometimes this has bent me to the ground  Now that this is all ending  I want to hear some music once again  'Cause it's the finest thing that I have ever found   But the Jordan is waiting  Though I ain't never seen the other side  Still they say you can't take in the things you have here  So on the road to salvation  I stick out my thumb and He gives me a ride  And His music is already falling on my ears   There's people been talking  They say they're worried about my soul  Well, I'm here to tell you I'll keep rocking  'Til I'm sure it's my time to roll  And when I do   When I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbye   'Cause when I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbye

      Hubby's brother is a dad! Jacob William was born early this morning. Yippee!  Saw "Uptown Girls" tonight and loved it. Sometimes you just know from the previews that you'll enjoy a movie. Being right about that instinct is so satisfying!  Currently watching a Spice Girls bio (VH1 special broadcast on Canada's MuchMoreMusic). Seen some of the footage before, but the distance from all the "Girl Power" hype makes it interesting all over again.

      We're having a rainy beginning to the season, but the sun is out today to say "Hi, Freddy Beach!" I walked to the library to celebrate the good weather, and though my legs were not happy about the climb back up Regent St, I'm glad I went. Now I can read "The Blue Castle" again. Yay!  Just finished  urlLink "April Operation"  and also received  urlLink "Grace At Bender Springs"  in the mail, on loan from a friend. I am in novel heaven! ;)  In movie news, hubby and I watched  urlLink "Bowfinger"  on TV last night. It was quite funny, and I loved the premise of the show. Go rent it, 'kay? ;)  All right, chores await me, since I leave them for my days off. Then I'll do some writing. Honest.

      It's  urlLink Father's Day  and I want to give some recognition to my dad, 'cause he's great.   When I was young, I thought parents were simple people, their main job and only real interest being their children. A silly way to think, but I've found that discovering my dad's character and hobbies is a fun process. For example, I would never have guessed that he would enjoy reading mystery novels, but he beat me to completing the "Cat Who" series. I admit I may have seen that as a challenge, almost a dare. :)  Thanks, Dad, for your hard work in raising four girls and for your commitment to your marriage. You and Mum make a great pair! :D

      One of my co-workers thinks I'm obsessed. She might be right about it, but that's not going to stop me from collecting the movies and music I enjoy. I'll call it my "de-stressor" because I really do feel much better when I can put in a fun flick or play great tunes. It's who I am, and everyone's just going to have to accept it. ;)  So, speaking of movies, I saw  urlLink "13 Going On 30"  and loved it.  Added a couple  urlLink Jennifer Love Hewitt  songs to my ever-expanding music collection, and found one or two by  urlLink Newsboys  as well. :)  Now it's time to work on a short story while the tunes flow!

      Yep, that'd be me. I did clean up all the dirty dishes, but other than that have accomplished little today. Oh well, I deserve a fun day off now and then, don't I?  Watched  urlLink "Star Trek II"  a couple days ago, so today I felt like continuing the story with  urlLink "Star Trek III."  Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon brought on a desire to see  urlLink "Star Trek VI."  :) Maybe I'll put  urlLink "Star Trek: Generations"  in the VCR this weekend, to watch the last of TOS characters in the movies (and also because I love the TNG characters).  Got  urlLink "The Cat Who Sniffed Glue"  (hee hee) this morning from the library, along with  urlLink "April Operation"  and  urlLink "A Cry In The Night."  Still waiting for  urlLink "The Blue Castle"  and also requested  urlLink "The Church Ladies."   I have a bunch of websites open right now, to read fictional pieces or the latest blog posts, but I feel like reading or writing offline. Those sites will have to wait, I guess. Can't be staring at the screen all day, can I?  See you later!

      Just worked out a couple more inconsistencies in my novel, but as is my bad habit lately, I've just got notes. No paragraphs to fit in here and there, yet at least it's on paper!  I don't know how some authors can crank out novels like they're on an assembly line, 'cause this first of mine is taking a long time! I sometimes think that if I didn't have a job that took thirty hours of my week, I'd be more disciplined. Then I realise this is  moi  I'm talking about, and I'd be even worse. ;)

      Finished reading "Jurassic Park" this morning. Yet another example of a great, complex novel made into a blockbuster movie (which necessarily simplified the story). I think I'll check out another of Michael Crichton's books soon.  I woke up early this morning, so I got my grocery shopping done while all was (relatively) quiet at the store. Also went out for a walk after I started the weekly laundry load. Found out there's a small playground a couple streets over from the elementary school, and along with a nice bit of lawn, it has a slide, monkey bars, swings and a pool (empty at this point but I'm sure it'll be used often this summer). It was a quiet little spot this morning, and the path to it cuts between backyards, making it a good route for the kiddies. :)  Not much else happening here yet. Cleaning up a little and may start another novel. I'd like to write something, I just haven't decided whether to tackle another bit of my novel or take a break to be more creative.  All right, time for lunch! Yum yum! ;)

      Time to catch up on the rest of my birthday happenings. Even though we went to Boston Pizza after a normal supper hour, there was still a half-hour wait. Guess that's what we get for going during the first week the place is open for business. The food was great but I found the place quite noisy. Must be so used to our quiet little apartment, and working shifts at Sobeys that aren't that hectic. Maybe we'll go back to BP on a Tuesday night sometime for the cheaper pasta night.  Watched "Troy" after supper (pretty good) and then gabbed with my mum. Also gave a quick call to one sister, to send along birthday wishes for her oldest boy.  And that was about it! This morning I opened the new pack of CD-Rs, then made a quick trip to the library. I found  urlLink "The Cat Who Knew Shakespeare"  and  urlLink "Certain Women"  plus I've got a request in for  urlLink "The Blue Castle."  I also just started re-reading  urlLink "Jurassic Park"  since I remembered we had a copy.  Have to work in an hour, so I'm "out to lunch" now - chicken breast and pasta. (Yummy!)

      Okay, so I forgot to yammer on and on about the movie I saw last night. After all the hype, you'd think I'd chime in with my own review. So now I will!  First off, to the women sitting behind hubby and me in the theatre: You shoulda read the book first, so you'd know what was coming and wouldn't have to comment to your friend. Oh, and stop saying "Geez" at the non-scary things, like spiders and snakes. (Not that I love spiders, but I didn't find that frightening this time, only interesting.)  Okay, now about the movie itself.... Good job taking an excellent plot and simplifying it for the screen. That is never easy and so many films fail at it. I haven't read the book recently, so I can't comment as accurately on omitted or changed elements; but I can say that I wasn't disappointed.  I was a little freaked by all the fainting. Strange, isn't it, that huge spiders and snakes didn't scare me while the passing out did. It's because it felt  real . Especially when Harry's head hit the ground the last time - I felt like I was watching myself, two and a half years ago, collapsing in a hospital hallway. (The doctor said it was low blood pressure, which I suspect was the result of wonky blood sugar levels - at the time, I knew nothing about hypoglycemia but you can bet I never forgot that "incident.")  Lemme see, what else about it? I liked the fading in and out, which one review likened to silent movies. It worked especially well with the fainting because the voices came back before the picture. (Trust me, that happens.) I liked that the Hogwarts grounds looked more earthy and realistic than in the first two movies. (I'll be watching them again to compare the straight green turf with the new look, which actually lends an aura of age and authenicity.)  I also liked that the robes were often replaced by "Muggle clothing." Our pals seemed less studious and more like teenagers, as they should look.  Anyone who didn't like Buckbeak should be decapitated. ;) (If you don't get that, ask someone about Buckbeak's sentence.)  And let's give a standing ovation to Alan Rickman, who seems to have perfected being mean and nasty. I thought he was great in  urlLink "Quigley Down Under"  and then found myself pleasantly surprised with his role in  urlLink "Sense & Sensibility"  since he was a good guy! I should hunt down more of his movies. (Seen  urlLink "Love Actually"  also, but his part is too small to get much of a taste.)  All right, so that was my review. On to other details that I wanted to share.  Oh yes, the gifts! :) My mum gave me a new hardcover journal, bright green with a design that feels like an optical illusion. I wonder if that's a hint for me to fill another book for her on my observations about fiction writing and the intricacies of penning a novel. ;) There was also a new red t-shirt, and not an icky orange-red either, but the color I call "real red" (that is, a good pure red).  Hubby gave me a set of dominoes since I've been playing that game often at  urlLink Pogo . I didn't realise there were solitaire games and many different multi-player ones. (Pogo's version is like "Muggins" but without stealing anyone's points, since the computer does the score count for you.) Both the dominoes and the card decks came in collector's tins. Cool!  My mother-in-law very thoughtfully supplied me with CD-Rs for all my storage and audio CD needs. (A 40 GB hard drive is not always enough for this gal.)  There's a chocolate cake in the freezer (it may last for a while with all that sugary icing - "yum yum" but a "no no" at the same time) and for dinner, I will get to see the new  urlLink Boston Pizza  in town! I told you I was a brat, now we can add  spoiled  to that. ;)  This post is way too long for anyone to sit through, so I must stop. See you later!

      It's finally my birthday! Yay!  For the second year in a row, someone from work called to give me a shift. At least this time the boss realised that I had booked the day off and apologised for the call. All I got last year (from a different supervisor) was "Okay, bye." Where did "Happy Birthday" go, ladies of  urlLink Sobeys ?  I couldn't get back to sleep after that, so it remains to be seen whether seven hours will be enough to keep me going. If I need a nap later, I'll be sure to call it a  siesta  'cause that sounds more sophisticated. ;)  We returned from  urlLink "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"  (which was awesome) just after midnight, so I spent the first bit of my birthday watching  urlLink "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"  and then  urlLink "eTalk Daily"  as well. Also watched the beginning of  urlLink "License to Kill"  on the same channel, only because it was Timothy Dalton playing 007. (In my not-so-humble opinion, he makes a better Rhett Butler than Clark Gable. Go watch  urlLink "Scarlett"  and see if don't agree. Better yet, come to my house to watch it 'cause I have my own copy!)  All right, time to get ready for a walk. It's going to be a lovely day!

      When I came home from work today, my birthday celebrations began. True, I was born on the eleventh, not the tenth; but why shouldn't a woman be allowed to extend her special day? ;) Hubby humours me when it's possible.  He gave me a rose and I opened a gift from him after supper. It was perfect for me - two decks of Winnie the Pooh cards! (I like Tigger best, and love to collect card decks.)  We'll be going to the movie theatre in a while. Then I'll celebrate more tomorrow!

      I get to see  urlLink "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"  tomorrow night (provided the show isn't sold out at our theatre). I'm excited, though I know the plot from reading the books and have also been forewarned (from reviews online) that many elements from the novel will be missing. (To which I say: Naturally, they don't have enough screen time to include everything!)  Oh yeah, the title of this post also refers to my birthday, on Friday! How could I forget? ;)  Finished  urlLink "The Cat Who Played Brahms"  tonight. Very good, I think. Maybe the most satisfying one of the series so far, since I had long ago read one book from Qwill's time in the country and wondered how it all fit together. Now I know much more, and I'll be waiting for Polly Duncan to make her entrance into Jim's life. It's so much more entertaining to read the books in order!  Music recommendations tonight: "Witchy Woman" by  urlLink The Eagles  and  urlLink "So Called Chaos"  (Alanis Morissette's newest CD). And if you haven't discovered the talent that is  urlLink Nickelback , check 'em out now!

      I was listening to  urlLink PFR  and  urlLink Newsboys  on my walk this morning. (I rarely go without the tunes, since they often increase my pace.) When I came back, intending to recommend the bands here, I learned that PFR made another CD since "Them"! It's been out for three years and I didn't know? I am so behind on the Christian music scene....  So, go check 'em out. If you're not a fan of rock, try to find some of the lyrics on  urlLink Let's Sing It  'cause PFR's songwriters are very good.  All right, time to wash some dishes. I have the  urlLink "Singles of the '90's"  Ace of Base CD on, so that will make the chore more interesting.

      Yesterday, I saw a few movies. Here's what I thought....   urlLink "Mean Girls"  - Funny, probably due to the amount of talent from current or former Saturday Night Live crew. I'm partial to Lindsay Lohan since the remake of "The Parent Trap," but she's also great at being mean and nasty.   urlLink "Paycheck"  - Not bad for a film dealing with the touchy subject of predicting or changing the future. I'm keeping this one around for an entertaining action flick.   urlLink "The Rundown"  - Who knew The Rock was so funny? Sure, he was tougher than any human could be without the excuse of superpowers (think Spidey or Superman) or genetic mutation (Wolverine from the X-Men) but the movie was still a fun watch.   urlLink "Grey Owl"  - Good at making me want to learn more about the real guy, but they should have cast someone who looked way less British. It was one of those times where you're thinking "How stupid are these people that they can't see through his pretense?" By the end, though, I was listening more to what Grey Owl actually stood for than caring who played him onscreen.  To come another day, when I have lots of time:  urlLink Spartacus !

      Neither sporting event turned out the way I wanted yesterday, but such is life, right? The Belmont Stakes  was  a good race, and the hockey game was great right up to that last Tampa goal. I'll be watching Monday night as soon as I'm done work and cheering for Calgary once again.  Had seven days of computer uptime before I booted into Windows to view video at  urlLink msnbc.com . As hubby pointed out, it wouldn't be hard for them to support other browsers. To which I responded, "Well, look at the name of the site. Microsoft's being stupid as usual." Anyway, I got to see some interviews and video bits about the  urlLink new Harry Potter movie , which I may see Thursday night.  And a question for any hypoglycemics out there: Do you have odd dreams some nights? I get very weird ones, frequently, and I'm guessing it has to do with low sugar levels during the night. Just wondering if that's a valid explanation. The other is that I could be a lunatic. ;)  All right, my plans for the day are as follows: go out for a walk; do laundry for the week; write down a few ideas to make my mystery novel a bit more mysterious; type up some changes that still aren't reflected in the computer file of the novel, since I happen to enjoy working with paper and pen; drink eight cups of water or tea; watch one of my 197 movies (!) after evening church service. And I've got to stop glancing at the birthday presents sitting by the window; I like surprises, but the dimensions of the packages seem to be quite revealing.

      It's much more fun to type with the sun beaming into my place, and I'm glad the rainy weather has deserted Freddy Beach for now. I even left this post for a while so I could soak up some rays and then finish my thoughts. :D  Birthday present count: 2. Card count: 3. And only five full days to wait! :D  I'm eagerly awaiting some sports coverage tonight. First, Smarty Jones will attempt to win the Triple Crown at the 2004 Belmont Stakes. Later, Calgary may win the Stanley Cup!!  I'm going to get some editing done on my novel while I watch TV. It's about time, right? ;)

      I decided to depart from my normal route when I walk for exercise, and headed instead to  urlLink Odell Park . Since I live at the top of the hill, I started at Thompson Field and had time for a short visit to the beginning of the trails in the park. The trees and the absence of concrete were unexpectedly uplifting. I'm going to make the park my destination as often as possible when I walk! (And I should visit the bottom of the hill sometime to get a map of the trails from the park's lodge.)  Thanks for the wonderful walk, God!

      I doubt I'll get as far as deciding to unveil the complaint I mentioned earlier, but I might as well blast some pop singers while I'm being so opinionated.  Here's my advice: Stop giving in to the pressure to be sexy. It turns you into a tramp! Examples include Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and also Beyonce Knowles. You've taken it too far, girls!  Beyonce's solo album sucks, in my not-so-humble opinion. I don't want to hear you telling your lover what you want him to do (yuck, there's such a thing as privacy) and the other songs, "Crazy In Love" excluded, are  booooring .  I still like some of the Destiny's Child songs - because they just plain rocked - but I'm disappointed in Beyonce. Could you please go back to singing church songs and get some more clothes? Thanks.

      What's a body to do? On the one hand, I've heard lots of people say that aspartame isn't good for one's health. On the other, I have to limit my sugar intake or my body will reel from wonky levels in my blood.  Either way, I'm gonna be in trouble. Guess I'll just continue my plan of alternating between the two, but keeping all of it at a lower level than the average person does.  Though no one who's warned me what to eat or drink will read this, buzz off unless you're going to consider that my choices are limited. Oh yeah, and I'm old enough to decide whether hot dogs taste good. So shut up.   Oh crap, I'm grouchy today.

      I don't like causing a fuss. Today, something bothered me, but I'm not sure it's worth complaining about. Well, I told hubby right away and then vented in a letter to one of my sisters. I thought about posting here, either giving the details or hinting, and yet I haven't been able to get as far as submitting the post. I'd rather just deal with it on my own and forgive those who currently have the title of "snob" in my mind. It's not their fault I'm so defensive about it, and everyone  is  entitled to an opinion. So, it's time for me to just get over it.   Deep breaths   Maybe I'm just too melodramatic. ;)

      Been working an extra shift for a couple weeks in a row, so I'm not doing much more than going to work and then reading when I get home. I'm almost halfway through  urlLink Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  but I spent this afternoon watching movies instead of continuing on with the novel. Ah well, I've got plenty of time.    Deadlines that are sneaking up on me include the yearly inspection for our vehicle and a short story project I just agreed to, though I have no ideas at the moment for new stories. (Oy, they only come when I'm already busy.)    I work next weekend, so I'm already looking forward to the August long weekend. I might get two days off! (Imagine that...)

      I should have been warned by my mum's bad habit of taping nature shows and never watching them. But alas, I had to learn the hard way.  I've been collecting music and movies like crazy. And I don't always have the time to watch the films or listen to the CDs I have. I'm collecting out of habit, though I must say I'm actually picking pretty good stuff while I'm at it. ;)  I'm taking a holiday from all that and will get through the withdrawal by actually enjoying my current collection. That might mean I listen to  urlLink Finger Eleven  and  urlLink Maroon 5  too much, but at least the discs won't sit on the shelf neglected as I find something else I just "have to have."  Sucks when possessions begin to possess ya...

      Saw "Spider-Man 2" yesterday at the theatre, and loved it, as expected. There's a great  urlLink review  from john_murdoch2002 at imdb.com if you're interested.  Been spending my spare time re-reading the Harry Potter books, so we watched  urlLink the first movie  again last night (while waiting for  urlLink "Catch A Falling Star"  on TV). With this series, I enjoy seeing the films so close after reading the books and pinpointing the differences (mostly in my head but sometimes aloud). Novels get much more across and use our imaginations, yet I'll admit to being addicted a little to the visual entertainment as well. (Don't worry, my love of books can't be surpassed by TV. "Inconceivable!" ;) ) Tonight I finished reading "The Prisoner of Azkaban" so it's on to "Goblet of Fire" next. :)

      Today's sermon at church was from  urlLink 1 John 4:12-16 . Here's my understanding of the passage:  The chief evidence of God's love was Jesus taking on the role of Saviour and Redeemer. We can accept this love or reject it. (BTW, I'm a big believer in mankind's free will.) If we take this enormous gift, another decision lies before us: do we hide it away and just wait for our time in Heaven, or do we choose to pass on the love?  Our mission as believers in Christ is to drink freely from God's neverending supply of love, to let it transform our hearts and lives. It will overflow to others and we will live in love as His Spirit lives in us.  Let's make God visible to the world by displaying His love in our actions and attitudes.

      I opened up a window some years ago To see if there was anything I did not know In spite of my enlightenment, it seems I was blind But some seeds got planted and they grew up inside  Now I can give you reasons for the hope that I have This faith in Jesus is based on the facts But you don't know what you're missing Till you get a glimpse of something better  When love comes to life The lost find their way When love comes to life The blind can see the light of day My mind, my heart, my spirit all testify Everything changes when love comes to life  I could say so many things, spin convincing arguments Fill you up with herbal tea and read from dusty documents But if I make you stay up all night, still I can't make you decide To pick up the evidence and put down some pride  When love comes to life The lost find their way When love comes to life The blind can see the light of day My mind, my heart, my spirit all testify Everything changes  It's holy love that motivates the bravest of souls To tremble in awe of the sacrifice It's only love that motivates the faintest of hearts To say these words I say to you  When love comes to life The lost find their way When love comes to life The blind can see the light of day My heart, my mind, my spirit all testify Everything changes, everything changes, everything changes When love comes to life

      I didn't ask for it, but I got a lesson tonight while preparing for church.  I changed outfits at least three times, either coming up with dresses that were too tight or stained. I hadn't realised it before, but it's time to go through my wardrobe and shed a few items. (Losing a bit of weight would be great too, but it'll take longer.)  I was still frustrated and annoyed when the singing began at church, until I viewed the situation as an opportunity to rid myself of unneccessary items. I'll be moving within the next year or two, so this could actually lighten the load we'll need to transport to our next home.  Though I hate to throw things away, there are certainly times when it's beneficial to release some of the possessions I clutch so tightly. They're really not that important, are they?

      My guest post on the  urlLink Master's Artist blog  didn't format as I wished, so here I go again, simply for my own peace of mind:   Silence is golden   I spend much of my days filling the air with the sound of TV shows, movies or music. I'm not very good at being quiet, a fact my mum could confirm. ;)  I've learned over the years that this isn't necessarily a bad trait, my love of noise. It was through the noise that God comforted a devastated teenage Rebecca who'd been dumped for the first time. He brought me back from my days of "I'll run my own life, God, until I'm ready to hand over the reins" and spoke to me through music. That's why my Christian music collection includes praise and worship, pop, and a bit of rock too - there's a spiritual message along with the pleasing tunes. And something for every mood I'm in.  Granted, there are times when I must seek a bit of quietness for my soul. I have to be sure that I'm not just making noise to avoid thinking,  seriously  thinking about life. There's a need for balance, and I admit that I probably see-saw back and forth rather than remaining in the optimum spot. But don't we all?  For all those who love to make some noise, I submit lyrics from Rich Mullins' "Sing Your Praise to the Lord":   Sing your praise to the Lord  Come on everybody  Stand up and sing one more hallelujah  Give your praise to the Lord  I can never tell you  Just how much good that it's  Gonna do you just to   Sing anew  The song your heart learned to sing  When He first gave His life to you  The life goes on and so must the song  You gotta sing again  The song born in your soul  When you first gave your heart to Him  Sing His praises once more   From the rising of the sun  To the place where it sets  The name of the Lord is to be praised  The Lord is exalted  Over all the nations  His glory above the heavens  Who is like the Lord our God  The One who sits enthroned on high  He who stoops to look down upon  Down upon this earth and its skies   Sing aloud  The song that someone is dying to hear  Down in the madd'ning crowd  As you once were before you heard the song  You gotta let them know  The truth is a light to shine upon the way  So maybe they can go  Sing His praises once more   Let the name of the Lord be praised Both for now and evermore Praise Him, oh you servants Give your praise to the Lord

      The wind howled and the clouds darkened by the minute. A farmer plodded down the path to his barn, the smell of snow filling the air around him.  "Too early for winter," he muttered to himself. "Just brought in the harvest."  A friend of his,  claimed  to be a wizard, had told him that something evil was about to happen. "Danger will fly over mountains with the first snow. It won't be long now."  The farmer had laughed at the proclamation. "You're always dreaming up a new warning. What you need is a season in the fields, working the land. That'll keep your head on straight."  When he had seen to his animals, he bolted the barn door securely and walked towards the house. He would have stew for dinner. A delicious rabbit stew, stirred frequently and kept warm by his wife. Her mother had taught her the art of cooking from an early age, and he had been extremely grateful every day of his twenty-year marriage.  Halfway to the house, the farmer stopped. An awful stench reached his nose. He turned around but saw nothing unusual. White flakes floated down to the ground and he watched them for a moment. Then his stomach growled, and he thought again of dinner. "I'd best get home," he told the snow.  Something heavy struck his head, and he tumbled to the dirt. He saw a green mass, then only darkness with the second blow.  * * * * *  The survivors gathered in caves outside of town. They counted their losses: the scorched houses and farmland, the slaughtered livestock, and half a dozen slain citizens. Twice that number were injured, some hanging on the edge of life itself. Farmer Ian Morehouse, for example.  His wife Tina hadn't waited to watch the house burn; after crawling out a window, she dragged her husband's body to a wheelbarrow. Then she ran with the loaded cart. Dared she hope Ian would live past this night of hell?  "Who were they?" Bea Thomas asked. "Did you see the attackers?"  Tina shook her head and soaked another cloth in water from a stream inside the mountain. There was so much blood to clean that it seemed impossible Ian had any remaining in his veins.  She heard Bea turn away to repeat her question to another woman. The two discussed the possibilities, and their theories included invaders from the south, punishment from the gods ("if there are any," Bea said) and even the fabled dragons of centuries past.  For Tina, the cause of the assault mattered less than the chaos left behind. She made Ian as comfortable as she could with only the two extra cloaks Bea's brother Kendrick had handed her when she entered the cave.  She fell asleep sometime during the night and awoke later to hear a familiar voice in conference with Kendrick. Was that Durwin, Ian's wizard friend?  "What are we to do?" Kendrick asked.  "Stay where you are for now. Tend to the wounded, and leave the worrying to me."  "But how will we survive the winter? There won't be any grain or cattle left after this destruction."  "You'll find food enough in the woods, just as your ancestors did the last time."  "What do you mean? What 'last time'?"  "About two hundred and fifty years ago. It wasn't falling stars that sent fire on your cities, though your history books recorded it that way."  "What was it then?"  "Dragons."  Dragons! Tina moved closer to Durwin, carefully stepping over the bodies of her slumbering neighbours so she wouldn't miss any of his words. She crouched on the floor not far from the two men.  Kendrick would be a fool if he let the subject drop now. Though many thought the creatures belonged only in children's tales, tonight it seemed quite possible that they had destroyed her town so quickly, with their fiery breath as a deadly weapon.  Kendrick had remained quiet for a minute, perhaps thinking the same things as Tina. "You really think they exist?" he asked.  Durwin nodded. "I've seen them. And I'm going to talk with them, stop them from attacking the entire kingdom."  "Are you mad?"  Durwin smiled slightly. "Trust me, Kendrick. I  will  talk with them." Then his smile faded. "Whether they listen is another matter."  Tina stood and walked the few steps to the corner where Durwin and Kendrick sat. "I'm going with you, Durwin."  Kendrick stood "Mrs. Morehouse - "  "I know what you're going to say. Don't." She turned her back to him, giving her full attention to the wizard. "I want to represent the town."  Durwin stared at her, then looked around the room. "Yes, you will do it well."  They left at dawn. Ian had not woken up, so Tina left a message to be read to him if he regained consciousness.  "Thank you for the spare parchment, Durwin."  He looked down and smiled much as her father had done when she was a little girl. She had often found that the wizard had a paternal manner about him. "I'm sorry he hasn't woken yet," he said.  "He may never." She took a deep breath. "This journey is for him."  "Then I should issue a warning - you will represent all of your race when we stand before the dragons."  "You'll still be there, won't you?"  "Yes. I will speak on behalf of mankind, but in another form entirely. I'll appear before the dragons as one of them."  "You can do that?"  He nodded and quickened his pace. When they could no longer see the caves, Durwin transformed himself. The size of the creature before Tina certainly intimidated, but she admired the purple tinge of the scales and the graceful wings. When the head bowed to the ground, she scrambled up and sat at the base of the long neck.  They flew north, passing other burnt towns and villages. In a large, snow-covered meadow outside the king's city, they found the dragons resting.  Durwin landed gracefully at one end of the field and allowed Tina to climb down to the ground. He whispered words in a strange language and she found she could understand the dragons' speech.  The dragons greeted their visitors with a mixture of curiosity and hostility, rushing forward to demand Durwin's business in that location yet not going so far as to attack him, despite their large numbers. Even though Durwin brought a human into their midst, there might a code of behaviour amongst their kind that held back their disapproval.  "Who are you?" they asked. "What are you doing here?"  "I am known in this land as Durwin. I have come to ask that you stop your slaughter."  One of the nearest dragons, whose scales were a brilliant shade of green rather like an emerald, stepped forward. "We do what is best for the land. These  men  plunder and abuse, but we listen to the earth's cries. The humans must be destroyed!"  "My husband is a farmer!" Tina shouted, discovering that she also had the ability to speak like a dragon. "He cares for his land, but you struck him down anyway. He may die because of you. How many others were killed who love the earth? Yet you storm through the towns and burn everything!"  "Men are a plague on this earth," the emerald dragon replied.  His friends agreed. One with a darker green hue said that even the farmers had less respect for the land than a dragon.  Another said, "We are following the examples of our fathers, who purged this land before."  "There is no need for this," Durwin said. "You will never changed the hearts and ways of men by killing them. You need to teach them."  "Men are unteachable," Emerald declared. "The great prophet Kadris urged us to be the voice of the earth and we are."  "Kadris preached change and mercy, then lived them."  The dragons all began talking at the same time. Some claimed that Kadris would destroy the race of men himself if he stood before them that day. Others claimed Durwin had not learned well enough from his ancestors if he thought Kadris believed in mercy.  "Enough!" Durwin called, somehow making himself heard in the din. "I know what I preached to your great-grandfathers. It was not destruction and hatred of men!"  The meadow was suddenly quiet. Tina heard a few tentative peeps behind her; even the birds were frightened of the dragon debate.  "What are you talking about?" Emerald asked.  "I am Kadris," Durwin answered. "I lived among dragons many ages ago, and they passed down my counsels. Yet they have been distorted by false interpretation. I ask you again to cease your war against man."  " You  are Kadris?"  "Yes." He changed into his usual wizard form. "I am known by many names, in various lands. And if I had been amongst you lately, I would have corrected your errant notions."  No one spoke; the time for serious thought had come. Durwin conjured two chairs out of the air and invited Tina to sit down to tea, which had also materialised from nowhere with scones and jam.  When the dragons were ready, Durwin shared his plan for the future. There would be a meeting with the king and his advisors, where the dragons would teach men to live  with  the land and prevent its pain. Because men could not hear the earth's voice, the dragons would be required to warn the king and his subjects when their actions threatened to inflict harm.  There would also be language classes. Tina would instruct the dragons in the speech of men, and would also give lessons in dragonspeak in her region of the kingdom. The king's advisors were in charge of the rest of the realm for that task.  By the end of the week, the dragons had issued a formal apology to all citizens who had been affected by the raid. The emerald dragon had personally expressed his regrets to Tina, and had lent her a pouch of healing stones.  Ian's recovery lasted several months, during which time he met with the dragons many times to discuss farming techniques that would ensure fertile soil on a continuous basis. Dragons began to have a good reputation amongst mankind, while men and women were referred to in the dragon community as "interesting little creatures."  And Durwin travelled to the land of the dwarves, where he called himself Thalian.

       urlLink Facing the Challenge  has great insight on living the Christian life in a world of unbelievers. There are sections detailing just what it is that Christians believe (so we know and can explain it to others) and also articles and info on movies, books and television shows.  I spent most of my time at the site in the section on movies (the TV one wouldn't load that day) and appreciated the willingness to look for positive messages in films produced by non-Christians. God can show us great things through different methods, if we'll keep our minds open and receptive to the truth.  Check it out!

      I just spent thirty minutes or more organising my website bookmarks. I've been trying out a browser called  urlLink Opera  and like it a lot, so I imported all my favourite links from Mozilla Firefox into the new (to me) program. But I needed a fresh system - Opera had a ton of links already saved (basically, recommendations for the user) that I wanted to keep along with everything from before. Oy.  Anyway, I'm all done that job. Now it's time to prepare my lunch and snack food for tomorrow's work day. I am so looking forward to Monday and Tuesday off!  Quick movie mentions:  urlLink I Spy ,  urlLink What A Girl Wants , and  urlLink French Kiss . :D

      I found " urlLink Bridget Jones' Diary " mildly entertaining when I first saw it. However, since I had no forewarning that Helen Fielding had borrowed characters and plot elements from Jane Austen, I got stuck on that point. I wasn't impressed that she couldn't write her own story.  Over time, I started to wonder if I shouldn't give the movie another chance. I have few reservations about " urlLink Clueless ," so why should I pick on "Bridget"? And I do so like Colin Firth's Fitzwilliam Darcy.  I recorded the show when it was on TV a month ago or more, and today found time to give it another chance. I appreciated it a lot more this viewing. It was fun to see the common elements, and the modern spinning that Fielding gave to the characters, Bridget especially.  I may just track down the book now! And I'll be looking forward to the  urlLink next movie . :)

      Happy holidays to any other provinces celebrating today. The two that matter most to me at this moment are New Brunswick, where I'm currently living, and British Columbia, where I grew up and long to be.  I'm in evil Windows this morning. ;) I have a song downloaded from  urlLink Puretracks  thanks to a freebie code sent by my mother-in-law. (I haven't yet seen any products that contain these codes in the packaging, but the odds are that I wouldn't want the food, just the code.) Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play the track in Linux, despite my media players having WMA plugins. Methinks there's a conspiracy, and it stinks. Therefore, I'm a-gonna listen to Lenny Kravitz's "Where Are You Runnin'" in Winders at least one more time, though I feel lost and trapped with this unstable OS. (Forgive the rant, I've just become so much more comfortable with open source software.)  So, what should I have for brekkie? There's no milk in the fridge 'cause I needed the last teeny cup at 4 a.m. to tame the monster known as my stomach. (Serves me right for having hot chocolate before bed. All that sugar. Oh, but it was good when I drank it.) I could have toast, or oatmeal (though it's odd not to have a drop of milk to add to it). Or I could get off my keister (now that's a funny word I've never used before) and walk to the nearest gas station for a 2L of moo-juice. I might just do that, 'cause I love cereal. And I have a new box of  urlLink Honey Bunches of Oats  calling to me. (Food does speak to me, you know.)  All right, I'll make a decision in a minute. After that, I have to go for my morning walk (my only form of exercise away from work, though I know I should do something else) and then clean the kitchen. I'd also like to finish a short story I've been gradually adding to, then read more of  urlLink "The Bourne Identity"  ('cause I haven't made much progress lately even though it's a good book).  And wouldn't it be nice if I had a few more minutes later to add another entry? I've missed yakking here, but life gets so busy during the summer!  Catch ya later!
