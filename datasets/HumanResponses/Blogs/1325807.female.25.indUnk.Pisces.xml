      I had a movie marathon session with my friends last Saturday, after Teza treated us at Krocodile.  Teza, Lod and I watched  urlLink  I, Robot  :    urlLink     Rating? I give it a 7 out of 10.  Why?  Wala lang.  Basta hindi lang sha 10.=)  After that, Teza and I watched  urlLink  King Arthur  .  Lod had to go since he has work at 8pm, and the first movie was done 5pm.  He has to go home and change his clothes pa.=)    urlLink     Rating?  6?  Well, between the 2 movies that we've seen, I liked  I,Robot  better since  King Arthur  bored the hell out of me.  But it was a good film.  Labo.  Basta.  I have plans of watching  Along came Polly  later.=)  Addict!

      I've read one book of the said author, which is  urlLink Stardust , and I'm reading another one now,  urlLink Neverwhere .  So far, I can say that I admire  urlLink Neil Gaiman  for his creativeness.  I am intrigued as to where he gets his ideas.  Anyway, I just wanna share that.  I'm going home now....EARLY!!!!! Yehey!

      Yes, I am trying to make my blog a little better, nicer.  But, I don't think I like how it turned out.  It doesn't have that "strong look"....However, this has more features on it, so, I'll go for it in the meantime.  My blog is not the only thing that I'm trying to "salvage" as of the moment.  there is an ongoing issue here on the floor about supervisors and their relationship with their agents.  When do we determine that one is not performing properly?  When do we say that one doesn't have the "people skills" needed?  Such hard questions to answer.  But, this is something that I have to try to address before escalating to my manager.  This is a test of my managerial skills! Haha!   Another issue that I'm trying to salvage:  my "friendship" with the love of my life...I've waited, and have been waiting still...to no avail.  I was able to chat with him earlier.  And as expected, we talked about it again...   S: nanjan ka pa rin ba para sa kin? R: why do you ask? S: la lang... R: hindi pwedeng wala lang...naniniguro ka lang eh. S: hindi no.  bkt mo naman nasabi yun? R: eh kasi y bother asking? S: wala nga lang... R: eh kung sabihin kung oo? S: eh di oo... R: kasi naman puro ganito na lang tayo...ayaw pa kasi eh...hehe S: ayaw ano? R: ayaw pang ako na lang...=) S: masisira lang buhay mo sa kin R: bkt mo naman nasabi yun? S: baka lang R: puro ka baka...y do u think so? S: ewan R: magbibitiw ka ng salita tapos di mo alam kung bkt? S: hindi ko nga alam R: it just puzzles me...how can one's life be ruined if that something that she's been wanting for is given to her? S: akala mo lang yan len... R:  marunong ka pa sa kin. di mo naman madefend own reactions mo. S: di ko nga alam kung bkt...basta lang...baka lang...wag mo na kasi tinatanong dahil hindi ko talaga alam ang sagot.   ...Not the end of our conversation, but it was the end of that topic.  He will never give me a straight answer.  I will never be slapped with the truth....But I do know what the truth is...I've always known it, I just refuse to accept it.  We're too close as friends that changes will be hard to face.  It's scary to think that if things do not work out the way we expect it, everything will disappear, even the friendship that we have.  Who knows, baka tama sha na masisira lang pala ang buhay ko sa kanya?  It is possible that the things we want most may not really be beneficial to us.  Ewan.  yan lang din ang masasabi ko dahil hindi ko rin naman magawang kalimutan siya.  I guess I can make things better by not entertaining thoughts like this anymore.

      My friends and I watched  The Prince and Me  after hanging out at Segafredo.  We just wanted to see a light movie.   urlLink     Reaction after the movie?  Pelikula nga sha.  Complete with all the mushiness and close to impossible scenes.  I can't help but wonder, when does something become a fairytale, and when can it be considered reality?  I guess it's something relative...What could be achieved by others may be a fairytale for me, and vice versa.  Ang sa kin lang naman...maging kami ng love of my life ko is a fairytale na...pero to all the girls he loved before, and he is loving now (kung meron man), it's not a fairytale.  So, what is a fairytale for you?
