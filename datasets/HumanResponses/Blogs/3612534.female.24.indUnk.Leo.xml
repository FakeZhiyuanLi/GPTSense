      I didn't like where I was going, so I just quit.  That describes why I left the Army last year. I chickened out actually, I was afraid of moving forward and taking a stand. I was also afraid of staying in Kuwait during the war. If I hadn't had to get out, I would have ended up staying until at least July of last year, maybe longer. I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I suppose I need to let everyone know why I felt so compelled to escape from a job I loved so much. When I talk about loving the job, it wasn't my specialty in the Army, it was the Army itself. I liked the structure, I liked the people, and I liked the money.  My job was by no means a happy one. Death is not a pretty site, it makes you question or mortality, question your morals and values, and it makes you sad. Having to identify and process soldiers who are wearing the same uniform as you, fresh of their final battlefield is a shocking experience. It makes you wonder if the very next moment if you'll be right next to them, growing colder and more distant from this world as you travel to the next.  Sometimes I would see or hear about their families, hear the stories of happy childhoods. It's disheartening. It makes you wonder what your family would say about you if you passed away.  There is a lot of things I wanted to accomplish by the time I was 24. For awhile I tried to rush my life along to catch up to my goals, and then I realized that my goals had changed and I hadn't even noticed. There are some things you just can't rush for the sake of attaining them.  Joining the Army was a completely last minute opportunity that I sometimes wished I had let pass me by. It was February of 1998, and I was graduating from high school in 3 months. I had not applied to any colleges, one because I'm a procrastinator, and two because I am deathly afraid of change of any kind. Which probably causes my procrastination in the first place.  It was the week before Valentine's day that the recruiter called and asked if he could talk to me about the opportunities that the Army had. I agreed and he came over to the house to "chat". By the time he left, I had made up my mind. It sounded cool and easy, so I said yes. I wasn't the least bit hesitant either. What better way to transition from under my parents umbrella then to go straight under an umbrella of another kind.  Next, I had to choose a job. This, I don't recall, was to tough of a decision. I am a Leo, and as such I like to be the center of attention and have people look at me and go, "WOW." So I chose a job that people would hear about and be fascinated by: Mortuary Affairs.  When I decided on this specialty, my recruiter had to look up the job description. As he read it to me I envisioned thrilling and strange stories that I would be able to tell to friends and family. The recruiter told me that I wouldn't have a job unless we went to war...and then he laughed. How naive I was then.   So, I signed the papers, raised my right hand and became a soldier. Well, half of one anyway. I wasn't to leave for basic training until July 29, a day after my 18th birthday.  As the day approached I began the task of packing up my childhood and storing them in cardboard boxes under the house.  I would leave my parents the same way I came to them, with nothing.
