        "When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.  When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me." I am not a man.  Therefore, I still cling to a few of the precepts I clung to in my youth.  For example,   "When you wish upon a star, "Makes no difference who you are; "Anything your heart desires "Will come to you." I have been thinking about wishing on stars lately.  I used to wish on a star when I was a kid.  I would wish that me and my brothers could turn into cartoon characters and live in a parallel universe whenever we wanted to.  Guess what?  It never happened.  I've had a lot on my mind lately.  Like guys.  Especially Michael Perry.  It's weird, but we never seem to like each other at the same time.  He liked me in Middle School, I like him when I was a freshman, he liked me at the beginning of this year but then started liking Jazz.  I kind of like him now.  The trouble is, he still likes Jazz.  Says he loves her.  He called me yesterday to talk, and we were on the phone for over an hour.  I don't know how long really.  But we talked a lot.  I've never had a guy call me before, and so it was kind of interesting.  I take that back...Mark called me a couple of times when we were going out (back when I was young and silly), but we never had anything to talk about.  Anyway, Perry and I had a lot to say, and so we talked forever.  I talked about Duncan, and how I'm getting over him, and he talked about the pain he's experiencing now with Jazz.  You see, Jazz broke up with him.  She said they were becoming "co-dependent".  Isn't that what a relationship is?  But anyway, Jazz seems to be scared off by anything that she enjoys.  I don't understand that about her.  Why can't she just pray about it and find her answers?  She wasn't at school today, or last Friday, so I called her house and asked her mom to have her call me back.  I don't know if she will or not, but I hope she will, because we need to talk.  Perry was supposed to call me tonight, but I guess he never found the time.  I like this font, so I'll stick with it.  Anyway, I'll go into how I got over Duncan.  I'm still physically attracted to him, but I find no interest in him personally.  That's no problem, I'm physically attracted to several guys and it doesn't mess me up.  I still admire Duncan for his dedication to his workouts and stuff, and for how he's in track and everything, but I really don't like him much anymore.  He makes crude jokes and acts like a jerk sometimes.  Perry informed me that he makes crude jokes a lot and I still talk to him.  I guess my answer for that is that he likes me, and likes to talk to me, and that's why I still talk to him.  Besides, he's getting better.  But that still doesn't explain David Sadler.  Who knows why I stopped liking him.  But I did.  Maybe it was the way he leapt into it.  He shouldn't have gone so fast.  He also embarrassed me.  That must be what it was.  He should have taken it slow, and then I might have started liking him.  But you see, he liked Jazz this year and now he likes someone named Jennifer Lowry (I think).  My mom's a sweetie.  She just brought me down a Diet Dr Pepper.  I love them.  The boys are watching "Strange Brew".  How annoying.  I like the movie, but I don't know how they can stand to watch it so often.  I wore a black dress today, and Stephen Watkins comes up and says "Whose funeral is it?"  I replied, "Yours."  Anyway, I don't like Duncan anymore.  I'm not obsessed with impressing him, or showing him what an awesome person I am, or anything, so I think I'm over him.  Wouldn't it be funny if he started liking me now.  Doubtful, but it would be ironic.  Mom's breathing down my neck now.  She wants me to get off the computer so SHE can use it.  I just read those sentences to her and she made her little cute face, then decided to read a WinFax book.  She's trying to figure out how to talk over the terminal with Aunt Carol, who just got an IBM.  They've been faxing each other stuff like crazy.  Dad's fax machine is awesome, by the way.  I wonder if Noelle has a fax.  We could send each other stuff for like 14 cents.  That would be cool!  I feel kind of empty, not having a crush on anybody, and yet I feel free.  I'm single, and glad to be!  I think I'd like to get to know Noah Kinderknect, because he seems like a nice guy, but he's shy.  But I still have these silly feelings about Perry.  That's not good, because if I somehow got him interested in me again, it would hurt Jazz.  Plus, I might get hurt in the process.  So I'm going to stay away from that territory.  It's very strange that Perry liked me, because I never thought anyone would like me.  But he did.  I wonder if he ever will again.  My goal for my weight remains the same: to be able to wear biker shorts and a sports bra and look good.  That would be so awesome.  I would never wear them in public, but when I was working out I could and then I'd feel great.  But it seems like I'll never reach my goal.  Today Mom came home with a lot of chips and some French onion dip (my favorite).  I didn't totally mess up, but I did enough damage to where I won't be losing any more weight.  Yuk.  Anyway.  Enough about that.  I think Mom's going to be reading everything I write from now on.  She's silly.  Oh guess what!  We are trying to fax Aunt Carol a little certificate that says: "Gift Certificate from the office of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, M.D.  Good for one visit only."  Isn't that hilarious?  I love it!  I want to copy it and give it to people.  I should give one to Duncan, but he might get the wrong idea.  I'll give one to Perry.  He'll appreciate it.  Well, I think I'll stop now, because I really don't have much more to say.  Until whenever I write again...  -HA

       I was so tired this morning. But I got up and came to school anyway. So here I am in 1st hour with nothing to do but write. And that's good!  A lot of changes have been made concerning Kung Fu class, and I will illustrate them. First, we moved to a new church, which is much nicer than the old one and doesn't charge us rent. Second, the class went from two nights a week to three. Which brings about point number three, a price increase. It went from $25 a month to $37.  A lot of people were unhappy about the new high price, saying they couldn't afford it. Since I'm not paying, my only problem was the Saturday morning class, because I want to stay home and watch cartoons like a slug. But I decided to go for it anyway, because I don't want to be a slug. I want to be a trim, fit human being.  The weirdest thing happened to me yesterday at Wal-Mart. AJ said to me, "Heather, you wanna see Duncan? He's right over there." And my heart SKIPPED A BEAT. That was the weirdest feeling I've ever had! I think I'm letting this crush get out of hand.  AJ and Ben had been talking to Duncan. He's not too happy about the new prices and he thinks it's unfair. I don't, because Si Fu has explained how he came up with the price. He's only charging a little more an hour now, and he's giving most of it to the church, maybe all of it, as a donation, because he feels that's what Christ smiles upon. I hope Duncan will come back to class. He didn't come because he didn't like the price. But he talked to Si Fu after class. He's taken Kung Fu for two years and he shouldn't quit now. Besides, if he quits I'll probably never become more than casual friends with him, although I've already told him I have a crush on him. I wonder what he thinks of me? He probably thinks I'm a dork. One thing I know...I gave him a Christmas card and he didn't give me one back. That's because he never gives Christmas cards back. He needs to work on that.  I don't know how I'm going to tape Darkwing Duck while I'm at Kung Fu. I guess I'll have to play with the VCR timer.  Later.   -HA

       Today I woke up and the boys were already up. I had a Pop-tart and a bowl of Froot Loops. Later Dad made hash browns and sausage. 3 breakfasts! The boys went on a train ride with Jon and his friend. I typed my story, did work for dad and read books. We made a cool lunch (late.). I finished my Raphael story and started a Splinter and Leo story. They're cool. They boys got home but were at Jon's when Gma & Gpa came. They called me and I made them come home. They said Hi and then went back. We did junk with them and they left. The boys stayed at Jon's for 1 hour. Then me & AJ stole cookies & Ben used a slingshot. Then AJ played Mario 2. I watched. We watched TV & had supper. I had a shower and finished early. Then I ate milk & cookies, read, and went to bed.

       Today I got up early. Last night I had made the wish that I wish all the time: that I could transform into anyone I wanted to and go to that person's place but it has to be fictional. It never comes true. Today I sang in music for Mrs. Armstrong and Miss Davidson. It was fun. I wanted to invite Noelle over but I couldn't and I forgot to call her. We went out to eat and buy clothes. I had a good meal and a good dessert. Then we went home. On the way, we checked out Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Oh, it's the weekend! I am going to  State Governor's Cup Competition day after tomorrow!  Oh I can't wait! It will be so thrilling! We camped out in the floor tonight.

       Today Mom drove me to school and I am not talking to Melissa. She called Noelle a pipskweak all the time. I finished my contract today...everything. In Science we did a worksheet. That stuff is really interesting. In Academic Plus we talked about costumes for the play. In Reading, we read. In Social Studies, we took notes. In Math we did easy stuff but I forgot to do number 17. I'll try to do it in Academic Plus.  Melissa and I made up on the bus. Mark walked with me until he reached his bus. Well thats all.

       Today in Music we had a test. I got 100. In English we did our contracts. In Science we played review basketball. In Academic + we had Sex Ed. In Reading we made up stories about Tuck Everlasting. In Social Studies we got a new assignment to do a presentation on countries. Noelle and I are partners and we got Bangladesh. It is really neat. I want to invite her over this weekend to work on it. In Math we did some # line problems. At home I played my lesson. I did a little on Bangladesh and watched TV and played Nintendo. Kitty came over. We went to Wal-Mart. Turtles the arcade wasn't working. Back at home we had porkchops, spinach and mashed potatoes for dinner. That was  before  Wal-Mart. When we got back we had dessert. Us kids started to draw posters. AJ = Marios Me = DuckTales Ben = Popeye. Ben kept messing up. We read the Secret Garden.

       Today we watched a little TV and Mom made coffee cake, and me, the pig, ate almost half of it!  Then Dad brought over stuff from Long John Silvers and I pigged out! Later we dropped Dad off to get his truck again and then went to McAlpin's. I got some shorts with my gift certificate. Then we got A&W floats.  Then  we went to Toys 'R' Us where AJ purchased Krang.  Then  to Winn Dixie. I got 3 cute plants. Mom got tons of junk and then she didn't have any checks! She left for some. We left for home. AJ played piano then we went and rented Chip n' Dale (game). We ate dinner and Klondike bars. Then AJ got to Gadget. Then he died. He later showed us his cartoon of Turtles. Better stop now because it's 12:35...tomorrow!

       Today I got up and made my bed. We got ready but it seemed the bus had never come. We found that the bus had come, but very early. At school I lost my Bic pencil, but at least I had my books. We had a sub in Reading so I didn't get to turn in my Comprehension or my rough sketches. I finished my "G" in school and home. I finished my homework in time to watch Turtles. It was the one about Rex-1. When I grow up, I will live in the wilderness. I took a bath tonight and during it I thought about double-chins. Double chins make you comfortable-looking, but no second chin makes you beautiful. I'd rather be beautiful.  I started to write a  book  story about a girl named Agatha Amelia. We had Zingers for milk-and-cookies and brushed our teeth and went to bed. (I hope I get the stuff I asked for for Christmas. I will copy my list and put it in here.)

       Geez, it's the last day! And 14 min after midnight! And I'm going home in 10 1/2 hours! For good!!  I've just been reading this journal and it doesn't even  begin  to adequately describe my experiences here. It barely scratches the surface. Hopefully the sigs & messages in the back, along with my scrapbook, will help me to remember. In the meantime, I'll try to highlight my fave moments:    The Star Wars movies, July 16, 17, & 18. There were some tense times concerning those. "Star Wars" went off without a hitch, but "Empire" wasn't rewound & I barely found the projectionist in time for "Jedi"! Whew! But I pulled it off. Now I'm basically famous. :)  Being named "most radical" in my hall, July 20. This occurred basically because I dyed my hair red. (Pink would be a more accurate term :).) Right now I have a moon tatoo on my neck. Nifty. But today the girls on my hall kinda flashed F2...I didn't really care to get in on that!! Oh well, can't be  totally  insane...:)  Hanging out with Shannon Caveman. She's basically my best friend here, and we've spent most of our time together. We're in astronomy, so we shared some cloudy cowfields.  Astronomy. We never,  ever  had a clear night in a cowfield. Ever. So we didn't get to do as much as we should have. But we can't control the weather...meanwhile, we watched tons of great movies, like "2001" and "Stargate" and "Darkstar" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still". (Klatuu Baratta Nikto, It's so quiet in here, Doolittle - Tastes like chicken! - The earth was without form, lifeless, and I was pleased - Let there be light! - I wouldn't do that if I were you...) - and of course we must have some Star Wars quotes: "Will somebody get this big walking carpet outta my way?" "I have a very bad feeling about this." "It's not my fault!" "Free us, or die." "He's no Jedi." "Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view." "Strong am I in the Force...but not that strong." "Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny--consume you it will!"  Hanging out with Matt, Mike, and Shannon.  Much to your surprise, I did NOT spend all my time sulking and drooling over guys. (It just happened that I only wrote in my journal during those times.) -- testing a new pen... -- DAMN! Stupid pens're running outta ink!!   Playing piano. I used music to express my feelings when I needed to--it was great.  Talking to Doug Griggs. My problem-solving teacher is  so   cool . I love him! He's insightful & thoughtful. His class has been very challenging!  :)  Seminar. It's been fun, once I got over Drew. Well, I probably won't be  totally  over him, but at least I'm not panting after him.   *INSERTED THOUGHT* : tonight (last night) was the Final Banquet. We sat w/Focus Area. I was across from Matt & next to Shannon. Mike was next to Matt. I was about to mention something about looking for cute waiters when Matt yelled at me, "Stop lusting!" I couldn't stop laughing for at least 5 minutes. See, spending time with Matt is  great fun !!   *ANOTHER INSERTED THOUGHT* : Matt wrote that he had something to tell me before we leave. I wonder what he meant. What could he say? I've thought that maybe he's fallen for me, and I wonder how I'd react. I like Matt, but I don't know if I like him  that way . I don't know if I'm hung up on looks, or what. But then again I don't know if that's what he wants to tell me or not.  I remember we were sitting on One-Tree-Hill one night talking about love. He said he's never been in love. I told him about my semi-Duncan love. He said that he was sad about never getting a close relationship with a girl. The thought entered my mind that I could learn over and kiss him and change his life. I know I blushed, and I certainly restrained myself. I don't even know if we like each other.  But anyway...:)    Picture-taking. I've managed to take some good pix, and I hope they'll be sufficient to help me remember GSP.  Scrapbook. I've been saving little items and these I've put in a photo album. I'll put photos in the front.  It'll be cool.   Gonna stop now!

       The reader will pardon me, for any change he may see in my writing; for I have adapted my style, to coincide with that of Jane Austin, whose novel, I have finished this afternoon.  In the abovementioned novel it is obvious when two people, are going to be married. There was no surprise at the end, but a happy end notwithstanding. I find that in my life, it is much harder, to perceive the affexions of a member of the opposite sex; their behavior is to me, very baffling. And so it is to no great surprise, that I am dateless this evening for the Showcase. It is not necessarily a fete requiring an escort, but on my part, the escort, will be sorely missed. I refer of course to a particular person, the attentions of whom I have no cause or right to expect, yet my heart longs after him. But after such a grievous mistake as has been made the evening previous, I doubt he pays me any mind at all, except occasionally to shudder, at my impudence and silliness.  I saw him today at dinner, but dared not join him, for I knew none that were in his company; approaching him, therefore, would be forward. I ate in solitude, trying not to allow my eyes, to wander to his table. This was all in vain, since not looking at him is quite impossible.  As I left the room I greeted him in the least civil manner without being rude, and his greeting of me, was matching in its abruptness and apparent lack of interest. I am certain, that he is quite worried to speak to me, as I have lowered myself in front of him so plainly and stupidly. I cannot realize that he may never return my affections, for my life has always been filled with unrealised dreams.  This being said, I would like to assure the reader, that I am perfectly happy with my station in life, and although it brings me sorrow to think that I may always be an old maid, I will try to do a service, to my position in society.   * * *

       We just had a very interesting seminar. We talked a lot about politics and the environment and overpopulation and Darwinian theory and poor people and discrimination. It was great. I actually talked!  There's  a shock for you. I was in a really bad mood (mostly over Jason and feeling ugly and stupid) but I feel a lot better now. I was vocal, and my ideas were well thought out. So I feel smart. And a cute guy is sitting by me, and a cute guy agreed with me on things, so I feel attractive.  So...  Here I am, and I feel good now. It's been an okay day.  That's about it...

       I never found Alex. My suicidal thoughts and angry feelings about myself are gone. Thank you Midol.  I called AJ last night, collect from a pay phone. I actually wanted to talk to Mom, but she was at work. But talking to AJ was actually good. He is a sweetie.  He & Kristanne rented "Regarding Henry" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" on Saturday, and watched them at her house. They had a good day, though I didn't.  Oh well. It wasn't the worst day I've ever had.  I still feel bad because I think I really hurt Alex's feelings. I don't know what I can do about it. I'll try to get a hold of a Louisville phone book and find his address. Though I can't pronounce his last name, I'd recognize it if I saw it. I know it started with an "M".  Michael tried to tell me that it wasn't my fault. He's such a nice guy. He was too good for me. I lost him because I thought he wasn't.

       Is it vain to love your own eyes? Mine are so wonderful, and it's so great to have contact lenses so that other people can see them.  They're a lovely shade of blue-grey, speckled almost but gradual enough to be a fuzzy conglomeration of color.  When I came to this convention I didn't think I'd have much to write about. Turns out I have lots to say but no time to say it in!  Gotta go, but will return. -general assembly & dance time!  8:55- I'm back, & I'm not a happy camper. I was so excited before, but now I'm depressed. The thing w/Alex...I didn't get to run for president...I didn't win in Creative Writing. Barf! I must have next to no talent whatsoever. Occasionally I come off with a good line, but the rest of the time I must stink. (At least in timed writings!)  The reader doesn't know about the thing w/Alex, does he? He's a guy who kind of picked me up yesterday when I was depressed. I don't feel like going into the details at this position of the earth's rotation. Why? I'm just too depressed, bud.  So will I go to yonder dance? I haven't any idea. I was going to go & wear my green pants outfit, but now I'm not too sure.  Want to know why I hate pictures? I look ugly when I smile.  I really do. I have a fat face and when I smile, all the fat pouches up and hides my eyes. I would have decently-accentuated cheekbones if I wasn't so overweight.  And to think that this book was supposed to be a romantic tale of the life of a teenager. Tragedy sells, to be sure, but that's not the kind of autobiography I wanted to write. Well, that's life, and things never turn out exactly the way you expect them to. So I might go to that dance and actually have a good time. But most likely I'll just get more depressed, because I'm not a very outgoing person. Oh well--going to try on my pants outfit now. ---  9:13- I'm reverting back into the self-destructive hatred of Heather Aubrey of my sophomore year.  I hate myself! I was so rude to Alex, my writing sucks, Michael never really wanted to date me in the first place, I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and I cry over ignorant things. Like I'm crying now.  I'm such an awful person! No wonder poor Alex never tried to find me after last night.  My hideous ponch sticks out so far I look terrible in my beautiful pants outfit. My waist must be ten inches more around than it should be.  And I thought my creative writing piece was good.  Just shows that I'm stuck up to boot.  I want to call Mom. I think I'll try. No reason for her not to be home, unless she's at work :(  Can't. These phones don't call long-distance.  My butt is so huge! And my flabby face dwarfs the only good thing about me (my eyes), so even they're not beautiful.  I'm not going to eat dinner tonight. I need to lose weight. I'm so ugly. Maybe if I lose 15 pounds I'll look good, but it will probably take more than that. (15 off would only put me at 135, and the average girl of my height should weigh 115. I'm lame, huh, weighing 150 now. That's 35 pounds I have to lose, and of course, I can't do it.  I'm so lazy, dumb, procrastinative, unmotivated, lethargic...I'd need a Thesaurus to cover all the facets of my horrible self.  It's awful being this way and a perfectionist too. Being down on myself makes me even more unattractive than I already am.  Alex was such a nice guy! I'm such an idiot! He was caring enough to offer a depressed girl a place with him at dinner. (That would be me.) He was sweet enough to give someone a quarter to use the telescope out on the river.  He liked Star Wars!!  I'm such a fool!  I was consoling myself earlier with the thought that I'd never see him again, but that's cruel.  I need to go to the dance and find him. Sitting up here rotting over self-hatred isn't going to do me any good. I have to make amends for treating him the way I did!  11:27- I couldn't find Alex. Plus, I had a horrible time at the dance, per my prediction. It's probably my attitude. I expect to have a bad time, and it happens. Maybe someday I'll be able to go to a dance and actually enjoy it.  I'd have to be outrageously thin though, so I could "shake it" without flopping my fatrolls. Yuck! Michael says he'll teach me how to dance if I ever want to learn. I might take him up on that.  I was getting suicidal earlier. I hate that. Thought it stopped my sophomore year. But no, it started again this year. Great.  I think it's George coming. Perhaps my bad thoughts will go away. I'm already feeling better because I took 2 Midols.  Malinda (one of my 3 roomies) brought a guy back to the room. Just like I brought Alex back here yesterday. That's so sad.  I think I'll go try to find him again, & then mingle w/ my friends. He should be leaving tonight.

       Today started out great! Guess what? I gave Lou a note (our bus driver) about how the kids on the bus teased us and she made them stop! We got to hear a band play and when we rode on the bus home, Misty was nice to us, and she talked nice with us!  P.S. I got to play with Beth & Amy, and drew with them! Today is great!

       I am using all of these pages so I can catch up on the year. Right now I'm at Kitty's. We got her from the cancer place and took her back to her apartment. There, we watched MacGyver.  9:44 PM - Now I'm home. Earlier we went to Randall's, which is behind Little Caesar's across from Kitty's. We bought groceries for Kitty and then, when we got back, ordered a pizza. It was good, and while we ate we watched the very first Superman in the black-and-white series that eventually turned all color. It was neat.  Tomorrow is Dad's birthday. I am giving him an electric shaver with Mom & the boys that cost like 60 bucks. But he won't know that.  Well, now let me explain a bit about myself. I'm 13, but will turn 14 in May this year. I go to school at JCMS (Jessamine County Middle School) and am in 8th grade. I love my teachers. In fact, I always love my teachers.  I'm different from everyone else in that I'm smarter and weirder...or at least I show that I'm weird.  I like to write stories about the Ninja Turtles and Darkwing Duck.  I also like to write essays and poems. I was entered in the Governor's Cup Competition the past two years. In 6th grade I won 2nd place in Distric and Regional competitions but nothing at State. Then in 7th grade I won 4th in District and nothing in Regional. This year I hope to do better.  Another talent I have is drawing. I have been doing this since I was a small child, so I suppose practice helped me get so good. Drawing projects seem fairly easy to me, yet I set my goals so high. And then I'm discouraged if I don't do well.  I suppose I am a creative person. At the end of each school year, some classes give awards to the students. If there's a creative award, I get it. Well, I can't help it although it drives me crazy that that's the main word people associate with me.  Today's Thursday. Yesterday at church people wrote nice things about a certain person on that person's card which was taped to their back. When I read mine, shockingly none of them had written "creative". There was "artistic" though, and someone even wrote "pretty". I wonder if that person had the right girl.  I know I'm not pretty.  As for school, I am pretty well rounded in all subjects. I have Algebra 1, French, Social Studies, Shop, English (Advanced), Art, and Advanced Science, which is the hardest because no one in our class listens and then we fail the tests. But mostly I get A's. I got straight A's on my report card and midterms are coming out next Wednesday.  Maybe you'd like to know what I look like. I have long blond hair that reaches to my waist with bangs so long they're not bangs anymore. I have blue eyes, freckles, accented cheekbones, small eyes, and glasses. As for my body...I have a womanly frame but blubber covering it up.  Pet peeves- rudeness, Satan, people who make fun of classical music, etc.  I LOVE: pizza, the Turtles, Darkwing Duck, painting T-shirts, having parties, root beer, and playing the piano.  Oh.  Did I neglect to mention that I am a pianist?  Well I am. I've been playing for six years, '92 being the seventh. Come Nov. and I'll have reached 7.  I love to read too. My brothers, AJ, 12, and Ben, 10, aren't as interested in books as I am.  Je suis fatiguee (YAWN). It's 10:00. Actually 10:13. I'll need to get up early since there's school tomorrow.  Speaking of school, I need to tell who I hang with!  Surprisingly, the majority of my friends live in Wilmore, a tiny town near Nicholasville, where I live, which is a small town near Lexington. My friends live in Wilmore because their fathers are all going to Asbury College training to be ministers. When they're finished, the family will move away. This has already happened to me and will happen again.  First I'll tell you about Noelle Mitchell. She's my all-time BEST friend, but she lives in Maryland. Her dad's a minister, and she moved away.  We used to do so much stuff! We saw The Little Mermaid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze, and The Rocketeer in the theater.  Cool! But now she's gone. We call each other long-distance and write letters.  As for other friends, there are: Christy Bremer, who will be moving this year, Melodie Horst, moving, Kristanne Harden, not moving, Tareena "Teeny" Mulholland, not moving. Those are my basic friends, but there are lots more. I'm in Frnech with Teeny & Kristanne and we love to parler francais! Our teacher, Madame Fields, est formidable.  My mom is a wonderful person. She comes up with great party ideas. I had a sweatshirt painting party the 20th of Dec. and am planning on having a party where we'll make earrings.  Cool!  Well, I'm tired and there's school tomorrow. It's 10:25, January 9, 1992.  (Dix Vingtquatre, le neuf Janvier, mil neuf cent quatre-vingt douze.)  Well, gotta pray. Be back tomorrow. G'night.
