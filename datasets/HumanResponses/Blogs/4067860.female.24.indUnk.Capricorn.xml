      i remember learning this (or rather memorizing) this back in college, but my memory is not all that great, and i don't think i quite understood the concept in the foirst place. so i am attempting to understand the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve with the help of the web. so this is what i've found.   urlLink http://www.ventworld.com/resources/oxydisso/dissoc.html   this webpage is pretty straight-forward, has a lot more detail than i am required to know, but it has a cool link to an  urlLink interactive dissociation curve . not that i will ever figure out exactly what the curve looks like at certain pH, temperature, etc, but it's fun to play with anyway.  in order to understand the odc better, here is a link to  urlLink carbon dioxide transport . this page has a couple of great diagrams as to what's going on in the body and lung tissues. i'm still not all that confident with the carbonic acid/bicarbonate ion buffer system, but i think i've got the basics.  well,  urlLink this  is a pretty cool site. it's a site for emt students in new york. mostly focuses on oxyhemoglobin itself, but has a great diagram of the hemoglobin molecule. yes, i like diagrams!!   urlLink here &nbsp;is a hilarious analogy, about parents and children. gotta go, got a call...

      i am studying for a level i-iii class that starts august 25. i am taking my time; pacing myself with the unbelievable amount of material i picked up last week. it took me close to 3 hours to try and sort out what everything was, and what order i should be reading it in, but i believe i have it figured. i have begun reading through the moh precourse package. it is pretty self-explanatory, though the tems updated versions of some of the&nbsp;chapters&nbsp;are not nearly as well put together. i&nbsp;am attempting to learn concepts as opposed to memorize things, and i believe i am doing well. this material is all review though, stuff we learned in college.&nbsp;i would like to have a good&nbsp;knowledge base prior to getting in to the als modules. hopefully i'm not going to slowly. today i was reading the acid-base balance section. i actually feel like i understand the whole carbonic acid/bicarbonate ion buffer system, and metabolic vs respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. i had to do quite a bit of extra reading from my college anatomy book (hole's), but i feel pretty confident. i have spoken to a few people about the class and what to expect. it seems that the most important things to get to know are the standing orders and pharmacology. i have read over the standing orders, and plan to regularly. i haven't started with any pharmacology yet, but will not neglect this topic, thats for sure.

      well, i finally started the self-evaluation questions for the level ii module 1 course. d showed me how to get started on html, so i'm making an html file out of the answers. i am so excited, it's very cool stuff. turns out i won't be able to use the new textbook for the level ii course though, all the study questions are quoted on the old text page numbers. i'll post the link to that stuff once it's on the internet, but for now it's just on my computer. feeling good about the whole als thing.

      well i decided to start doing the readings for the first module of the level ii notes that they gave me. turns out the page readings are from the first edition of mosby's, which i conveniently own. there is one thing that is not in the more current version, and that is the normal arterial blood gas values (page 299t). so i will copy the table here, in case i need access to it without digging out the old mosby's.  pH: 7.35 to 7.45 PO2: 80 to 100 mmHg O2 saturation: >94% PCO2: 35 to 45 mmHg HCO3-: 22 to 26 mEq/L base excess: +/- 2.0  note: only PO2, pH, PCO2, and in some cases O2 sat are actually measured. In many cases, O2 sat is a calculated value based on the PO2 and pH.  taken from mosby's paramedic textbook (c) 1994, pg 299   urlLink here  is a cool table that also states the compensatory mechanisms to the changes.

      i was looking for the up-to-date seniority list on the  urlLink 416 listserver , and wasn't able to find it (i don't think it's on there). the most recent one is from 2002. but anyway, i found a bucnch of pictures from our protest on march 26. erin is pretty photogenic i see... thought i'd hang on to the links for the pics. i did not take any of these photos. what do we want? RESPECT!    urlLink all protest pics &nbsp;   urlLink erin    urlLink bunch of people    urlLink paul on the phone    urlLink far left with the toque on    urlLink strong women    you'd think we'd have the whole symptom relief thing sorted out by now, but no...

      wow, do i ever hate spam!it has never presented to be much of a problem for me (maybe my hotmail account at one time, but not for awhile). it's funny that the email account i use the least is the one that seems to be generating the most spam at the moment. it's sort of a catch-22 though... if you try to stop it by replying or contacting the server maybe, it just tells THEM that it is a valid email address. i was doing some research earlier, and found a spammers anonymous page.&nbsp;one is supposed to give these people the email address that the spam is from and they will contact them for you. how am i supposed to know if they are trustworthy or not?? huh?? this whole thing infuriates me to no end. and like donnie said, i am only one of the millions of people that&nbsp; hate it, and i'm only getting like 3-4/day...grrr!&nbsp;
