      Yesterday was okay. I didn't blog. 'Cos I went outside and played hockey... or rather just hung around. Haha... Since I went outside, my mom wouldn't let me on the computer. -___-" Gayness. But I snuck online and read his blog since he blogged. Tsk tsk tsk... he only blogs when something big happens or whatever. Well, I guess everything's okay. He called yesterday and we talked for a while. Again, he only seems to call when something happens... -____-" Like when he called to clearify the whole Shar thing and also when he asked me out... and now to ask about what was wrong. Blahness... -__-" Oh well... I guess things are okay now and stuff. I miss him... >O  Today was Hoops4Heart. We had a 3 on 3 tournament. My team won. [Yay! We won last year too!] and Nima's team didn't win... but he did really well. I was watching when I wasn't playing... and sometimes when I  was  playing. Hee hee~ *achoozZ* My deo is making me sneeze... baby powder scent... haha...! Nothing too flowery. Blahness... =/   Hmm, Erica told me about some Marcos dude. He sounds really funny. Godfrey asked me if I knew Marcos today on MSN. I THINK I know Marcos. They say his name is Marcos Ho. I dunno... I really wanna meet him though. So I'll be going to Sunday Worship whether I get a ride or not! 'Cos I really wanna meet this Marcos Ho dude! I knew a Marcos Ho from kindergarten! Hee hee! It'd be cool if I really do know him from before though! MuahahahazZ~! Anyways... Gotta go... If you're reading this, Nima... I love you ;)

      Went to school today... as usual. Math test... I think I failed. Blah... I asked Nima why he wasn't at basketball and he said it was because his sister got in a car crash and stuff so he didn't go... he couldn't call like he said either 'cos of that. Haha... Blah... I just hope everything's alright. I talked on MSN a bit, and Candace mentioned something about walking home with Nima, Jordan, Safee, and people and that Nima was acting weird...? She said he wasn't acting like himself and was being mean... mean but not rude. I asked how and she just said he was poking people really hard and being serious and secretive... ookay? Well whatever it is that's making him do that... I hope it's not bad. Nima... he has changed a lot lately. It's just... blah. I hope it's not a bad thing. Guys really need to figure out how to handle their anger sometimes... not just anger, but emotions in general. Blah... weird. He said he'd call tonight but will he remember? Hmm... Blah. Tonight's Literacy Night...~ I wanted to go but I forgot to tell Rodway that I could help out. Oh well... I'll stay home instead. My sister's there to help out tonight.   Kortright tomorrow. Gonna bring money to buy stuff at the canteen. Don't want to bring a lunch. Too "mah fan". Aish... I'm driving myself crazy! Thinking too much! >_  I told Moca and Erica about *cough* today. I trust both of them to not say anything about it. Breathe not a word. I already told IngiEE about it a little while ago and she kept it low. I can trust her for sure always. I didn't tell Felis yet though... she seems to be pretty busy lately. Blah... I told Moca that it was gone but now it seems to have... come back a little bit. I trust myself... not gonna slip~ Hee hee! Wrote notes with Moca in History class about it. Blah... Gonna go bye-bye soon. Anyway... I'll blog later... not in the mood. Tired, arm aches, blah...

      Hmm... Nima didn't show up at volleyball at all! I thought he was only late or something... blah... maybe his mom really didn't let him go... I just hope it's not 'cos he's sick or hurt... :( I'm worried. I should call but he's probably busy so I won't bother him... Plus, I'm still waiting for that call he said he'd make to me this afternoon. Haha! Joking! I know he wouldn't call anyway. Blah... wow! I had a great time at guitar! Sure, I had some catching up to do since this class is faster, but wow; I learned a really cool song. Anyways... Gotta run. BubaizZ~!

      Just got back from guitar class. Well, I guess Nima and the others are at volleyball right now... Grr... I hope Katie's not flirting with Nima! >:( Haha! Anyway... I've got a pretty good guitar class! Nathan, Caleb, Timothy, and Joseph. Hmm, Nathan and Caleb are the only half-decent looking guys there. Haha! Zoe would love to be in my guitar class! Oh... Erica just called. Asked about why I wasn't at vball and why Nima wasn't. I don't know why Nima wasn't there... but yeah... Weird. Blah... He knows he's always welcome to vball so yeah... maybe his parents didn't let him go this time. Blah... Anyways... soo hungry. Need to eat dinner~~~! Blah... Gotta run... washing my hair before dinner~ Peace. Je t'aime~ (you know who you are)

        Nima...   Me, I’m scared of everything. I’m scared of who I am, what I saw, what I did. But most of all, I’m scared of walking out of this room, and never feeling for the rest of my life the way I feel when I’m with you.

        Vivian, Ingrid, Erica, Ioana, Felis, and Nima...   If one day you feel like crying, call me. I don’t promise to make you laugh,but I can cry with you. If one day you wantto run away, call me. I don’t promise toask you to stay, but I can run away with you. If one day you don’t want to listen to anyone, call me. I promise to be there, I promise to be very quiet. But if one day you call, and I don’t answer, come over quickly because I might need you.

      School today was okay. Didn't do much. First 3 periods were science workshops, so that required no homework or anything too hard. 4th period was math. We took that stuff up and after lunch for 5th and 6th period, I went downstairs to the kindergarten rooms with Mayhar (or however you spell it) and helped out there. It was a lot of fun. That kid... Jasmine reminds me of Felis. Blah... went outside during first recess and I practically freezed! Didn't have a jacket on and yeah... Erica came and kept me warm a little and got Kwan to lend me his white shirt so that I can put it on and keep warm a bit. Didn't expect it to be this cold... Haha! Oh well. Mayhar is one funny guy! We messed around a bit downstairs in the kindergarten room and stuff until the kids got ready for the activities. Wow... really tired today. Had NO sleep last night! Scaryness. Haha~! Went to bed around 11PM but didn't go to sleep... just stayed up all night and thought about stuff. Crazyness! Anyways... yeah. I'm not going to volleyball on Tuesday nights anymore. My guitar lessons changed to Tuesdays and they end right when volleyball starts... so unless we have a lesson cancelled for some reason then I won't be appearing on that volleyball court on Tuesdays anymore. Hmm... Nima said he'd call before he left today but that didn't happen. As usual. I've learnt to just forget about it if he says he's gonna call. He never remembers. Blah... whatever. Don't care anymore. Guys are so dumb sometimes... -__-"

      Got back from band practise. Decided to start a new blog here. Like it says up there in the top right hand corner, this isn't as detailed as S-D, but detailed enough for certain things. My S-D people will know what I mean but the non-SDs won't. Just don't worry your asses off trying to figure out what I mean by that. Be satisfied with what you have. Anyway, back to band practise... We had a great time. Jammed, cuddled, jammed, ate, jammed, and jammed some more. Sounded great. :) But...! I had a headache~ Loud sound caused my headache to worsen. Drums AND electric guitar... all turned to the max... ouchiezZ~ >o  Went to bed at 5AM last night... [- -] [_ _] [- -] [_ _] Bad me... Shouldn't have gone to bed so late. Well, actually I went to bed around 11PM last night... but just didn't  sleep ! Spent all night thinking about stuff. I guess I just haven't been able to get a decent shut eye lately... I'm sure I'd sleep pretty well on [NT]'s shoulder. Haha! Anyway... I'm still smarting from the headache... Blah. I miss [NT]... Hee hee~   So yeah... I'll probably bitch here and just let everything out here too... instead of bitching at people. Major PMS. Haha! Anyways... Yeah... I'd probably bitch here a bit... only a bit. Skin deep bitching. Get what I mean? Won't go into too much detail. Just enough. I'll leave the others to SD. :P If my MTF/GFJ people don't know what I mean by SD, it's alright... I might not tell my MTF/GFJ people about this one... 'cos they know everything else from SD. Haha! This stuff is blah. Muahahahaha! If you're reading this and you're clueless, just shake it off and read on! Haha!   GUYS... LISTEN UP OVER HERE...  So yeah... one thing that guys should know... [certain guy(s) in particular] I don't know how else to say this but I'll be speaking on behalf of 99.999% of the girls/girlfriends out there in this entire world... (or just Richmond Hill... haha) Okay... back to my speech... "One thing that guys should know is..." we get jealous! Haha! Yes, strange but true! You know what? Blah! These weird guys that God put here to piss us off and cheer us up after pissing us off need to find out sooner or later. Hee hee~ Yeah, yeah... maybe you kiddies get jealous too sometimes... but hey, you're not the only ones! From reading my friends' blogs, we all seem to get jealous every so often! When, you may ask? When you pay more attention to other girls than us! When you flirt with other girls in our faces! (Or behind our backs) When... O__o" Shit! I think I've run out of "when's". Umm... WHEN YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO US! Yeah... something like that. See? I've been doing my homework/researching! Hee hee~ Anyways... Yeah... just so you kiddies know...! :) So watch out ! :P Watch yourselves ;) LmAozZ~ JkzZ~! But yeah... the truth :P  Ahhh! Gotta take a shower... I'll blog later... *mwahzZ* XOXO~ Peace.

      Wow! That's 4 emails from Wilfred... IN A ROW! Well, 3 of them are regarding my issues and 1 is regarding the fakeness thing. He's a good advice giver... very blunt though. *sighzZ* Blunt is a good thing. Let reality hit me and let me deal with this. Good strategy, Wil.   Anyways, I guess I know what to do but I'm just afraid. Talked to my unni and I guess it's full-steam ahead with that. Please pray for me. I need the LORD's guidance through this... and probably patience, faith, and all that.   Nima, I love you.  Blog later. Maybe.

      School today was okay. It feels a lot shorter though. Bleh. Band practise cancelled today. Damn... I was looking forward to it... Blah, whatever. Don't care.  I talked to Will and Wilfred about something last night and I'm just waiting for their comments on it. Blah.   Talked to Brian here and there today about stuff and yeah. I know he'll keep his mouth shut though. I trust him. Might send him the thing. Dunno. I'll see.   Martin thinks I should say something but Moca says I should act upon what is happening now instead of saying something. I guess I have to agree with Moca. It's better in the long run. I'll see what Will and Wilfred has to say about it. I probably won't be hearing from Will for a while. He hardly comes online. I'll see him at Bethel though so we'll talk then! Hehe~ ^^   So bored. Talking to Julie about stuff. Didn't talk to itf much today. I didn't say much on purpose. Blah.   Things happening everywhere... all is screwed. Blah... whatever.  I'll blog later. Don't feel like blogging right now.

      I got back from going outside for a while with Moca. Called my mom and then went back outside with her and sat on the driveway, talking. We talked about Poodle Boi and Nima mostly.   We both had our problems and we both talked to each other about it. She made me realize a lot of things that I knew but ran away from. I was in denial... and I know it. I don't know what to do now. I have two choices and either way somebody's gonna get hurt. Myself or him. I've sheltered him from most of the hurt already and I'm at the point where I can't stand to take more of the hurt and troubles. I don't think I can shelter him any longer. I can either bear the pain myself and jeopardize the chance of letting it "all fall down" or I can stop sheltering him and let reality hit him. I don't know. I'm getting really tired of this. I'm sick, and I'm tired. If I take any more of this, I'm gonna blow. I mean it. Is all this really worth it or not? So many things I don't know... so many things I haven't seen.   KFD (got the codename from PFF) was real. That I know for sure. Itm wasn't real in the beginning (real in another sense) but eventually became more than real. I realized that. But I couldn't let it go on.   I don't know if RD is real or not. I want to know. Either I get hurt in the truth or I hurt itm. I don't know. I'll see... Gotta go. Sister wants computer. I'll blog later if I can... or if I want. Don't know.   I'm glad I went outside with Moca... maybe it'd have been better in than if I went outside with Nima in the sense that I learned something and I got advice on my issues. Dunno.

      Bored to death. Called Moca. She finally called back. Unfortunately, I was watching Newly Weds on MuchMusic. I wanted to go outside and she was calling me back about that so she waited until I finished my TV show and my ice-cream and shepherd pie and then we're going outside now. I miss Nima and I wish he could come but he's out so whatever.  Well, I'm gonna go get ready... bringing my cowboy hat. Hehe~ I'm off. Peace out. Gonna be back in an hour. By then, I'd probably be kicked off the computer 'cos my sis will be home from her party and she'll be on the computer so meh. Bye bye.  P.S. Read Ingrid's blog. Damn, she's got a lot going on... gonna pray for her too.

      I'm talking to Martin on MSN right now. He's a bit troubled... about grad and Sonia... pretty much something that's on every couple's mind. Pretty saddening... grad's gonna be fun, but high school... it's a big step. Big step for everyone, not just couples. Friends too.  Talking to Martin these past few days have really helped me. He's made me realize so much by merely talking to me about his troubles and about his relationship with Sonia. Praise the LORD.  Ingrid just came online. Gonna talk to her about *cough*. We got interrupted at church when Erica, Karen, and other people walked in on us so yeah. Meh, whatever.  Hmm, Ingrid sent me her blog... I forgot to read it last night. But I'm so hungry right now! Ugh... I'll grab some ice-cream and then read it while I eat it! Hehe~! Or maybe I'll have a cup noodle. Iunno, whatever. But I'll finish this blog first.  Martin really got me thinking. I've been trying to put off thinking about it, but grad has me scared. In high school, there are a lot of other really pretty girls and really nice and outgoing girls. I love Nima and I can't stand EVER losing him. I'm serious. Love IS an understatement. I'd rather die than lose him. I already feel like I'm dying whenever I'm without him. It's gotten me so afraid. I trust Nima entirely, but I don't trust the girls. Really. It's not that easy for guys to walk away from a really really pretty girl who's flirting with you. I don't know... I'll definitely be praying for everyone about high school. All we need is faith and GOD.  What else can I say? Hmm, had a pretty deep talk with both Julie and Martin. That's pretty rare but it's becoming a common thing for us. Maturing? Possibly. Meh, whatever.  It's weird how I think so much and yet think so little. I think so much about other things that I don't think much about my everyday life and stuff that I need to think about daily. Wasting my thinking on the wrong things? In my opinion, there's no such thing as thinking about the wrong things unless you're being perverted.   Got a few comments from people about my "fakeness" email. A few people agreed with what I had to say and one of them, who shall remain unnamed, seemed pretty cold with me. I don't know... either I'm paranoid or it's true. Whatever. Don't care. Said all that I needed to say and that's it.  Wilfred said something about my email in his blog. I guess his way of thinking about it is true too. Meh, whatever. I did what I needed to do and I know what I want. So whatever.  My arm's getting numb from typing. Gonna go grab a bite to eat. Blog later, maybe. I'm off.

      Woke up, pressed snooze button on alarm clock, overslept, got up, got dressed, washed up, ate a donut, called Auntie Lisa, and got a ride. Arrived at worship late. Meh, better late than never. I'm glad I didn't decide to ditch worship again. Didn't write too many notes in there and I actually listened. I hope Martin did. The message could've really helped him there. Step into the unknown, take a risk, God is with you. Learned a lot... not only about Christianity but also about life in general. Definitely worth getting up so early. CD Team was cool too. Sat with Ames on the bus ride there and we talked. Just a bit. She's cool and really smart. Talked to me about softball. I wanna go play softball at RHCBC next summer. It'd be cool. :) Learn a new sport. I'm not too good with sports but I'll give it a try. Sounds like fun. Too bad I'm not of age this summer. Meh, whatever. There's always next year unless I get hit by a car before then and I die or whatever. God forbid.   Learned about Mormons and Catholics today. Well, Mormons were last week's lesson which I missed but that's okay. I read the notes from the duotang during this lesson and it was really interesting. Same with Catholic. I think I'm a little interested in Mormons... but, I know better than to even  think  about joining them. Not good. Satan's trying to tempt me and I know it. Can't give in. Please pray for me that GOD will keep me safe from temptations.  Thought about a lot of stuff during the time that was between worship and CD Team. Walked in this morning, late, for worship and stood beside Sally while we were all singing songs of praise. Surprised to see Wilfred there. I guess he didn't have Kung Fu. Oh wait, never mind. I think he was too tired to go to Kung Fu this morning 'cos he had like... 1 tournament and tons of demos these past few days. Hope he gets some good rest. Knowing him, he'll live through it without rest anyway 'cos that's just the type of guy he is. Meh, whatever. Talked to Ingrid a tiny bit about stuff before Karen and Erica and other people came outside so I shut up about it and I'll talk to her later on MSN or whenever about it. She'll read it all in my "thing" anyway.   Talked to Wilfred after CD Team. Saw him sitting on the ledge of the other doorway so I walked over and we talked a little. For some reason, it was... different. From before, I mean. It used to be all awkward because of our past but this time, I felt more comfortable with him. He felt like... a brother to me. Which is good. I gain another sibling in Christ. I hope that maybe this kind of relationship between the both of us will be better. It'll probably be a lot better. 'Cos it's times like these that I can use someone to talk to... someone that doesn't know much about the stuff but knows enough to give the right kind of advice. We've... got things in common. We think a lot. I don't mean  think  in the sense that others may think. I mean  really  think. Auntie Amy said that sometimes I seem a little more mature in the sense that I think deep... my perspective on that is that I don't think deep... I just think too much. Whatever.   It was weird talking to him after so long... but good in a way. Good that we don't go avoiding each other. Some guys just don't understand that girls... we look for communication in relationships. Or at least most of us do. I found that girls like to talk and interact more... whereas guys just do what they want and that's it. I dunno... whatever. Don't know, it's only what I think.  Talking to Julie on MSN. "Jealousy. Mistrust. Deception. Love. Truth. and. Lies. Welcome to our world." Very true. She and I are just discussing our nicknames. Mine says "Nothing But Empty Words". So basically, we're talking about how we deceive and yet there are so many interpretations of deceiving whereas the truth just exists no more. Very deep.   Bad timing... always bad timing. I have to go cook for my sister and I since I'm hungry. Noodles again. Ew. I'm tired of it. Well, I'll talk to Julie about this later... I'll blog later... maybe. My sister's going out to a party so I'll have the computer to myself. Maybe I'll go outside for a while. Iunno... maybe. Or I'll go take a jog or run... or maybe just a walk. Whatever I feel like doing. I'm off. Peace.

      Talking to Sonia on the phone and talking to Martin on MSN. Like I said before, Martin's like a big brother to me. Really nice guy. Total gentleman.   He made me realize so much. This is the first actual serious-serious conversation I've ever had with him ever since I met him. I know he's real. Not a fake. I know that the GM Crew is real and no fakes. We're all true to each other, and we stay that way. We don't back stab each other. *cough*  I'm getting tired... gonna get off computer. Julie wants to go on so from 6pm on, Julie will be on my computer. Hers is getting fixed. Whatever. I'm off... gotta say bye to Martin. Peace.

      Talking to Elayne and Nima on MSN. Talked to Elayne about haters, fakers, backstabbers, and stuff like that. Nima and I talked. Just a bit. He said "joey...i really dunt think u understand how much i love u" but I guess I can say the same for him. Meh, whatever.  You know what...? I need to read. The Bible. Erica came online. Hmm, I'm tempted to say something but never mind. This'll be better if I type it up and email it... Whatever. Blog later.  Nima came back online. His computer froze. He said "joey...im tired of making mistakes. i want every moment with u 2 b happy" But he doesn't understand that... it's not his fault, it's mine. I'm just... too picky and... screwed up. I dunno... he's offline now. His mom wanted him to get off. He said he'd call later. Meh...  Blog later.

      On MSN. Talking to people. I only have one thing to blog right now...  I hate it when people talk behind my back. If they've got something to say about me, say it to my face. I know that I talk behind a certain someone's back. (WASTEBUCKET) However, I've stopped. I'm trying to not talk behind people's back. I just can't stand it when people talk behind my back and then suck up to me right after that. They act like you're their really good friend but you know they talk about you. I'm so tired of this.  I wish there was a solution to this. I have one but it's not too realistic. I wish we could all just get together. Everyone. And just admit everything. Say how we feel about everyone. Openly. No lies. And then, we either forgive each other or we get mad.   I'd rather lose my fake friends than keep them. At least maybe then, I'd know who's real to me and who's not.   Elayne's right. Everyone's so fake. I'm fake sometimes too. But I try not to be. Now, the only people I'm fake to are WASTEBUCKET and S-GIRL. I'm not fake to Wastebucket anymore because I haven't been around her often so I guess she doesn't bug me anymore. S-Girl... I'm close to telling her how I feel about everything. That'll be the end of the relations between us, probably. I don't know.  I know that some people talk behind my back out there. I know. I don't know who exactly but I know there are people who do that.   I know that I'm not the greatest friend anyone can have, but I've learned so much from this grad trip and I'm gonna try to be a better friend. If anyone who's reading this is mad at me, please forgive me and give me time to change. I'm not the brightest person in the world and I'm pretty clueless about stuff. Please be patient.  As for the losers who talk behind my back and then suck up, I hope that someday someone can get it through your thick head that being fake makes you lose friends... I feel bad for you.

      Haven't posted in SD for a while. Meh, whatever. I'll copy and paste this over. As usual.   Well, grad trip was okay. Wasn't the best. Learned something. Good and bad. Mostly bad. Whatever.  The dance was okay. The food was okay. Didn't like the bus rides... uncomfortable. Got to know Sari better. Too bad. Only 3 days. She's pretty cool. The guy from INCO was weird. He kept talking on and on and on. I payed attention and responded to his talking and followed him off the bus to look at the smelter thing just so he won't be that embarrassed with no one but Oberoi paying attention. Sometimes, it's good to do that for people... so they won't be as "yu" aka bruised (in chinese).  Lots of stuff happened. Big. Nima... Erica... both I had problems with. Are they gone? I don't know. Erica... there's so much more to say but I won't say anything. Nima... no comment.   Just gonna get on with life and leave this behind. Whatever. One sentence can sum this all up: I don't wanna try no more... Just giving up. Whatever.  God said that if you knock, the door will be opened. Seek, and you shall find. Ask, and you'll get the answer. This can apply to somebody. But just not me. 'Cos I've knocked, seeked, and asked. Tired of knocking, seeking, and asking. Not gonna do it anymore. Giving it up.  Long story. Don't wanna tell. It's elsewhere but I'm sending it to Ingrid only. She's the person I can trust most... This is my  HONEST  ranking of trust with each friend I have:  1. GOD 2. Ingrid 3. Zoe/Lisa 4. Brian N/Alice 5. Will Ng 6. Felis/Moca/Kryss/Vivo 7. Candace  Probably the people I'm closest to and people I trust most. I have reasons. Go figure.

      Just got back some grad trip. Literally. Wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, wasn't as fun as I thought it'd be. Iunno... balances out, I guess. Hmm, for once, something balances for me. Certain people will know what I'm talking about.  So much has happened. This trip was... definitely worth it. I don't just mean that moneywise. I meant it was worth going on. Solved so much yet caused so much. Do I make sense? I don't know.  The Erica thing... I gotta read her blog sometime. Haven't been able to read blogs lately. Been grounded off computer. I don't have time to read other blogs. I've only been able to come and blog my stuff out and check my email quickly. I guess you can consider it solved. I don't know. There's still a small thing I wanna talk to her about... maybe I'll talk to her about it Monday. Dunno.  Nima... hmm, I'm screwed. It's all just so messed up. I know that I'm the worst girlfriend ever. I know. Not gonna say anymore. 'Cos he'll get POed that I typed bad stuff about myself. I did, but erased it. So yeah... Nima, you're perfect. You are. It's just that I'm not. That's why I've been such a brat about everything. Sorry for ever making you upset.  The event that was probably the fun-nest was the dance. We all hung out. One thing I learned: don't ever depend on a guy to dance. Their only method of dancing is slow-dancing unless it's for a school assignment. *rolls eyes* Only Jin and Derry danced. Jin was funny...! Haha! Total jokes. Derry was really good. I guess he practised a lot (no duh?!) of pop and lock... Meh, couldn't do much in my skirt but whatever. First time putting on eyeshadow at the dance. Haha! It was cool though. Nima and I slow-danced to...  Don't wanna try no more - Frankie J ,  This I Swear - Nick Lachey ,  Heaven - DJ Sammy , and  The Reason - Hoobastank . THIS I SWEAR by Nick Lachey is my favourite song. I requested it...  Talking to Brian Park right now. Omg... him and Alicia are so cute~! ^^ In my personal opinion, I think they're the cutest couple in school.   Well, I gotta run. Mom's back. Blog tomorrow. Lots to say.

      At Science North right now. Hee hee~ Got a chance to blog on the computers since we have internet access. It's so cool~! Well, took a pic with Nima twice and took a few pics of Nima. Hee hee~! Those are keepers. ^^   I'm sooo pissed. >:( Nika was trying to flirt with Nima on the bus! They were sitting beside each other (with the aisle between them) and she was trying to do draw on his arm or something. Grr...! She's lucky I wasn't on that bus. See? We're not even in high school yet and a girl goes flirting with Nima even though she is fully aware he's taken! Grr... Me angry!  I miss Nima... He's someplace... with his friends. Walking around Science North and checking things out. I missed him so much on the bus ride. All I could do was think about him. Missing him so much... I'm dreading going back on the bus. Don't wanna be kept away from Nima again.   I feel kinda woozy-ish from the bus ride... Ugh. Meh, I should end the blog entry here... I'm off...  Oooh, I forgot. On Tuesday after school, my mom saw that I was really happy with Nima and stuff and she just asked out of the blue what I'd do if he suddenly just broke up with me because he didn't like me anymore. Frankly, I'd be shattered... I'd rather DIE than know I can't have him... I can't stand being away from him. It'd kill me. Period. But of course, I didn't say that 'cos that'll scare my mom so I just said "It's okay I guess. I'd get on with life...!" and gave her a reassuring smile. Fake of course. I can't tell her that I can't live without Nima. I'm not stupid. Meh, whatever...  Nima's over there on the weirdo phone thingies... Meh, me blogging beside Ioana right now.   Caught a glimpse of what Moca was typing... it was about Poodle Boi. As usual... *sighzZ* I hope she's okay and that she'll really enjoy this trip. Before I left on this trip, I prayed to the LORD for His protection on this trip and yeah...  Wish I can spend more time with Nima... I miss him.  On the bus, I read a Manga called Kare Kano... Volume VI. Anyway... in the manga, there was something that really got me thinking. It made me know FOR SURE that I love Nima. It said that when the abscence of someone throws the balance off your heart and make you seem "lost", then that's how you know you love them. In my case, even one second without Nima can put me off balance... I love him. That was definitely reassurance... not that I needed any.  I love you Nima, if you're reading this... I mean it. Don't ever forget... it'd break my heart if you did.

      I'm gonna go to bed now after brushing my teeth and all. I wanna bring Nima Jr. to Sudbury with me but mommy won't let me. :'( I don't want Julie playing with it though 'cos it's my fav. :P   Well, at least Nima Taheri (aka Perfect One) will be there. Hmm, Julie's being weird. She keeps telling me she loves me and that she'll miss me. I thought she found me annoying? Haha! She's always like this when I go on trips that are overnight! Like Camp Wenonah, Kids Clubhouse tent-camping trip, Bethel tent-camping trip, and Camp Cooch. Now this. Haha... weirdo. Bleh, at least I know she really does care. :P  Hmm, I hope she respects me enough to take me seriously when I say DON'T TOUCH NIMA JR. OR NEMO! Meh, maybe I'll let her have a little hug from Nima Jr. before I go. Haha~! Iunno... meh, ish all good.  Well, I'm gonna miss my mommy and sissy and grandpa but its only for a little bit. I'm gonna miss Nima during the bus ride... and my guitar too! Hee hee~! Well, I'm off to bed. I wanted to talk to Nima before going to bed but whatever. He's probably in bed already or busy packing still. Meh, I'll see him tomorrow. Love y'all!  G'nite ye scurvy dogs!

      Well, I found time to blog again! Yay! Hmm, that sucks. No internet access at Ramada. I won't be able to blog about the trip. Dang nabbit! Blah... oh well. I'll blog afterwards about it if I get the chance.    Big news!  My mom went to Promenade to get my cowboy hat for me while I was in school! I payed her back the $30 already. But yeah... She knew I wanted to wear it to Sudbury and all so she got it. At first she said no 'cos if we went after school, there'd be rush hour traffic, but I suggested if she could go while I was in school and so she drove all the way down there to get my cowboy hat and she had to look for the store in her sandals which made her feet hurt now. When I came upstairs from having an after-school snack, I saw a duffel bag on the ground and knew I was supposed to pack so I opened the duffel bag and saw a plastic bag inside. I thought my mom had already put my platforms (for the dance) in there and then I felt it and it was A LOT softer than my platforms so I pulled it out and saw... MY BELOVED LIGHT BLUE COWBOY HAT! I seriously was gonna   CRY!   I love my mommy! Hee hee~!   I talked to Megha on MSN today after school and yeah... it was an interesting talk... I was high though 'cos of my cowboy hat! ^^ Will came online (yes, my bro in Christ) and we talked. Haven't spoken to Will in ages! Hee hee! Speaking of Will, I think him and Becca are such a pretty pair! So cute~!   So yeah... Tomorrow, I'm gonna miss Nima a lot. He's on Coach A and I'm on Coach B! Boohoo~! *sniff sniffzZ* Lucky Vivo & Mark... and Moca & Poodle Boi, and Rach & Jae. Whyyyy meeeee?! RooflezZ~! Bleh... Oh well. I guess God didn't let me sit with him on the bus for a reason. I have no idea why but whatever. Maybe to get me less obsessed about him! Haha! That's what I call  over-obsession  where I think about him non-stop. So yeah... maybe to get me back on track and not ditch my friends so much. Hee hee!  Had guitar lesson today. It was... interesting. We did our unique versions of Amazing Grace and it was totally fun! Hammering, sliding, pull offs, etc!  Oooh, there's a concert on July 18 (the day after my birthday) at the Molson Amphitheatre and I sooo wanna go! Hee hee! My mom said it was okay with her as long as the tickets didn't cost too much. Hee hee~! It's Evanescence featuring Three Days Grace! I wanna go with Moca, Nima, and Krystal for sure! Hee hee! It's sooo cool! And guess what? Tickets cost from CA $19.50 to CA $45.00! Hee hee! I'm willing to pay $45 if it means being closer to the stage! It'll be so cool! We can all bus there or go by subway (or both) and it'll be so much fun! ^^   If things go well, (and if I behave like a good little girl) then my mom and dad will get me an electric guitar for my birthday! Yay! I know they can't get me the Iceman IC400 'cos it costs WAYYY too much but a Fender Stratocaster (same type as Sexy) would be just as good! If not, a guitar like Nathan's! It's acoustic but can sound like electric and looks similar to one too! Of course, I'm aiming for a Fender Stratocaster primarily. :D BLACK BLACK BLACK~! My fav colour!   Hmm, me planning something for the 100th day in this relationship. Don't know what to do yet but I want it to be special! Coming up in a few weeks! A surprise! ^^  I'm thinking about what to get Nima for his birthday. I'm TRYING to get a FOX Racing thingy... possibly a white FOX Racing visor... 'cos he seems to like to wear a white visor with his t-shirts. Hehe~! He looks really sexy like that too! ;) Iunno... I'll see.  Wow, dinner smells great! ^^ Me hungry~! :D Well, enough talk... I'm gonna go on MSN for a while! Hee hee~ Then I'll blog after the trip if I can get on.   Gonna wear my cowboy hat tomorrow! Hee hee~! Me crazy! :P   I may not say it quite as much as I should But when I say I love you Darling that means for good So open up your heart and let me in... And I will love you, until forever Until death do us part, we'll be together So take my hand, and hold on tight And we'll get there... this I swear   That was the chorus from the song  This I Swear  by  Nick Lachey . Hee hee~ And here's the first verse...   You're there by my side, in every way I know that you will not forsake me I give you my life, wouldn't I think twice Your love is all I need, believe me   P.S. I mean it. ;)  To all whose reading this, I wanna let y'all know that I love y'all! You guys are the greatest friends a girl like me can have! I love you guys so much! Without you guys, I wouldn't be Joey! Hee hee~! (this means you take the blame for my faults such as my brattyness! hee hee! joking!)  To a particular someone who may be reading this, you know who you are... I love you. You know that, or so you should. You mean the world to me and even more. In my eyes, you are way beyond perfect... and I love you. (wow, these amazing three words: i luv u, can sum up so many feelings and emotions... and yet it's so complex...)

      At school right now. Computer class. Finally got a chance to blog. I was blogging at my own seat but Martin wanted to trade so that he can play with the other Martin. Some game thing. Whatever. But Martin's computer's internet connected was screwed so I switched to another computer.  Stuffed animal day! :D Hee hee~ I took Nemo (the doggy I got from Nima at Christmas) to school and Nima gave me the doberman I had wanted at Wonderland. I named it Nima. Hee hee~ It's sooo cute and fuzzy! :) I still like the actual Nima better though (aka Best Guitarist In The World/Perfect One)!   So Nima, if you're reading this... THANKS! Love ya~!  Martin got Sonia stuffed animals too. A polar bear and a silver dolphin, if I remember correctly. He told me when he came home from PCW~ I bet she likes 'em a lot. Hee hee! I miss him. :( Even though he's just a few seats away. *sniff sniffzZ*  Julie and I talked to Rodway and she said that she had good news for one and bad news for the other. Good news was that Julie was coming to Coach B with Rach and the others and bad news was that I can't go to Coach A with Nima and that Gula was going instead. I'll miss him! I mean, a boring bus ride for almost 5 hours without Nima?! That's like telling me to commit suicide! Nooo! Haha... Well, at least he'll have fun with his friends over there on Coach A. His best friends Mark and Alice are there too so yeah. My best friends are all on Coach A. *sniff sniffzZ* Moca, Erica, Nima... and all those cool dudees.   *sighzZ* This succckkkksss~ Blah... I wanna bring Nima (the doberman) on the trip too on the bus with me but I don't know if my mommy will let me. I don't like leaving him on the bus but I wanna have him in my arms while we go, so yeah.   Phew... Still at least 20 minutes until lunch time! I'm hungry! Mommy said that she'll make potatoes for lunch today! Hee hee! Yummy! But I'm siiiicccckkkk! :( I have a cooouuuuugh! NooooOOOOooooOOOOOooo~!   I miss him. Nima, I mean. Boohoo~~~! He's over theerrreee ----> but he's like... busy. He had his headphones on the last time I looked. Hee hee~ He looks cute with headphones on! Muahahaha!  Obsessing on my blog. Haha! I'm such a freak!  So yeah... well my fingers are tired from typing... weird keyboards aren't helping. I like the one I have at home better. Oh wellzZ~! Love y'all! Peace! XOXO~

      Just finished dinner. Hee hee~ Got a little bit more time online so I blogged. Damn, gotta go soon. TV show ended... meaning Julie will be upstairs in a bit. Bleh.  Screw it, I got sick. :( Julie had a cough or something and gave it to me. *sniff sniffzZ* It's so annoying. I hate getting sick. Blah.   The unni at the Maxine place (Korean store) put pins in the places where I wanted them to make alterations and the pins poked my arm. OuchiezZ~! T^T  Talking to Moca on MSN. Yeah, we're (the group) is planning on asking for help from Arbo. Really talented in music.   So yeah... there was some stuff bothering me lately but it's nothing. Just got me thinking. Nothing "BAD" bad... at least I don't think. It's in the near future though. Blah... cherish what we have now instead of thinking ahead too much. Stop and smell the roses. Gosh, I'm sounding like Wilfred. :S  Alice just came online. Said "howdy" and she said "heeeeyyy". Haha. Joking around with Moca too. Something seems to be wrong with Edward. Something about Celina. He seemed a lot happier the last time I spoke with him. Now he's all... gloomy. Gonna talk to him the next chance I get to. Can't talk to him now on MSN though because of time restrictions.   Girl/personal part... guys may want to take caution in this part of the blog.  So yeah, before I set out to try on my grad dress, my mom told me to put on a strapless bra and I'm like: "Ewww! Why?" and whining and stuff and she wanted me to put it on so that I won't have a strap in the way when I try on my grad dress... Very annoying. I'm not used to wearing strapless bras (usually wear sports bras) and now that I got used to wearing it for a while, it feels weird again in my sports bra. Jeez, annoyingness. Oh my gosh... just made me realize that I'm gonna have to wear a strapless bra at the night of grad! NooooOOOOOooo! Ahh! Haha! I'm such a freak! So yeah, just decided to put out my thoughts about that on blog... after all, it IS a blog.  End of girl-ish part of blog.   Haha! Moca just told me that she got a pin from Anime North and the pin said "Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't." Haha! Hilarious! It's supposed to be "Those who live by the sword, die by the sword." It's what Jesus said in Passion Of The Christ. Hee hee...! Funnyness!   I'm so bored. :( Man, I can blog all day! Haha! Alice told me to call Nima but... nah. He's probably busy or something. And plus, I don't wanna bother/annoy him or anything 'cos I usually call quite a bit and yeah. Meh, whatever. Isn't he out with his mom or something? Iunno... blah.  Bleh, gonna go now. Probably won't blog until June? Don't know. I might be able to sneak on once in a while... like in computer class or something... well, I'm off. Peace out.

      Sister's in the shower so I had some extra time online. She's using my computer from now until she gets hers back. I helped her unplug everything so that our uncle can fix it up. Anyway... so here I am blogging once again. Hmm, so much has happened? Iunno.   Well, the day after tomorrow is Sudbury. I've finally raised $30. (I found some of my spare change in my OTHER wallet which totalled up to $10) and so yeah. But guess what? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE PROMENADE TO GET MY BELOVED LIGHT BLUE COWBOY HAT! Haha! I'm such a freak. Anyway... so yeah. My mom says if we go on Tuesday after school, it'll be like... rush hour since everybody's getting off from work. She's not willing to go get it for me while I'm in school so I'm like: "NOOO!" Haha! Oh well! As long as I have my alien, it's all good. It's all that matters. Like I said before (gee, I'm so repetitive) I can lose anything but I just can't lose my alien. :)   I miss him... My mom and I dropped Julie off at her friend's house when I went to try on my grad dress again and we passed by Nima's house. (ahahaha! im so weird) I miss him so much. Meh. Ish all good. (o gosh... im turning into Moca! *mock horror*)  Anyway... This weekend has been THE MOST BORING weekend ever, thank you very much. All cos of the freakin rain and because I've been grounded off the freakin computer! My sister is now on my computer 24/7! Playing the stupid game Survival Project! Sheesh, I gotta uninstall that dumb game! It's taking up so much space on my computer! Plus, maybe if I take it off, my sister will stop going on my computer. Geez, she'll be here everyday! :O I'll even have to do something about my MSN Messenger! She'll be on it, no doubt, and reading my emails! Trust me, she does that! She went on my email last time and read 'em. Stupid sly idiot. She didn't know that you can always click "mark as unread" and make it look like she never read it. My mom and grandpa didn't know shit about computers and my sister denied reading my email. Geez, it was a really private one too. Grr! Little bitch...!  Hey hey, chillax! Don't get on my back! I'm a bit grouchy today so yeah. Blah... read a really cute, funny, and yet romantic manga at Rach's place. Grrr! Not gonna forgive Jae for stealing my seat! Hehe! Joking! Well, gotta bounce! XOXO~!

      Finally got a chance to blog. I'm grounded off the computer until June or something so yeah. Well, we had semi-band practise yesterday at Rog's place and yeah. Not very productive. Well, good news. I messed around on my guitar yesterday and wrote a song. Yeah... iunno... it's crap so yeah.   I went out today to try on my grad dress. Still need some minor alterations. That was around 6pm. Then I came back and went to Rachel's house with Jae. Haha...! Jae was on her computer going through her files while I just sat on the bed talking non-stop. Then, Jae got tired of going through her files and got off. I went on the computer but sadly, her internet didn't work so I couldn't blog. Dammit. Then, Jae wanted to get back on the computer to play on the tennis game on her VBA. Haha! He and I fought for Rach's chair. Big meanie Jae! >O

      Just read AL's bloggie. And I read something. *cough* So sad... Now my eyeliner ran because of the thingy I read. Grr... haha... Gotta fix it up.   *sighzZ* AL's going through a whole lot right now and it sounds so familiar... the stuff she typed, I mean. In a way, I've felt something similar. Somewhat similar. Not entirely though. Alice, if you're ever reading this I want to thank you. You're not the only one who's learned something from this. You've taught so much through what you're going through. I now cherish what I have with Nima even more (if possible) than before. I love Nima and like I've said before, I've come to this point in this relationship where I am totally comfortable with him and have all my faith and trust placed upon him. I love him, and I mean it.   I told my dad about Nima and I last night. He's in HK and can't do anything about it but he was okay with it. So now BOTH my parents know. Auntie Ivy definitely wouldn't approve dating at such a young age but whatever. I think my uncle who lives next door knows. So does my other neighbor. Haha... and the ones who live across the street! LMAO! Yeah...  Nima said he was gonna tell his mom, but I don't know... somehow, his mom scares me a little. I don't think she approves of Nima being friends with me or something... haha! What if she doesn't like us being together and does everything to prevent us from spending time together?! I'm scared... well I'm dressed up kinda girly-ish today. Haha! So yeah... a black "I LOVE BOYS" t-shirt (all over it), non-baggy jeans, a jean jacket, eyeliner, mascara, tiny bit of perfume (which may have faded by now) and yeah... haha! I'm so stupid. Just felt like it.   So anyway... I should get going to band. Love you Nima.

      On the phone with Nima right now. So worried about him. He's tired, and I think he's gonna get sick. I'm sooo worried. Some people told me that he had to t-shirts on and he took off one of them to keep the thingy un-wet. And Mark hit him in the jaw. He's hurt, wet, and tired! :( Poor Nemo. I miss Nima so much. Can't wait to see him tomorrow. Damn, I can't give him a huggie cos his parents'll be there. :( Maybe we can have the practise at Brian's or Roger's house? Calling Roger. Blog later.

      Well, I'm just pissed. The sun's coming out and there is no fuckin rain! Thunderstorm my ass! Thanks a lot, "MOM"! Screwed up my chance to go to PCW with my FRIENDS. Even if it wasn't PCW and it was somewhere else...! I wanted to hang out with my friends. Jeez... I'm soooo fuckin pissed.   Now she wants me to make noodles for her and Julie to eat. I don't wanna cook! Don't feel like it. Wtf... I hate this.  Krystal called earlier and told me that Mark and Nima were messin around and Mark punched Nima in the jaw and he started bleeding. Grr... that Mark! If he wasn't Nima's best friend/Vivo's boyfriend I'd have done something about it. I hope Nima's okay... I miss him.   Can't stop thinking about him... Ashegetam.

      Nima and Alice are leaving at 9:45. It's 9:31 now. I'm gonna miss him so much. This sucks... I'd be so pissed at my mom if the rain held off until tomorrow. Seriously. I was really looking forward to going to PCW. Now, thanks to her, I'm not going.   Julie, Rachel, Pickle, and Mabel are all going to Anime North.   I'll be stuck at home ruining my eyes in front of my computer, tv, games, etc... Instead of being outside in the "killer rain" *rolls eyes*   Don't mind me. I'm just being me in my ticked off mode. I don't understand it. No matter how I look at it, I really don't see why rain should be the reason that I can't go. Rain can't hurt me, kill me, or do anything to me! It's like if you pour water on me. *mock horror* Oh no! I'm WET! Now what?! *mock horror ends* See what I mean? Geez, I get really dryly sarcastic when I'm pissed. (wait, who isn't?)   You know what's worse? I'm "not allowed on the computer for the duration of June and I can't go out either... to anywhere." Great! I can't go outside and have some fresh air and enjoy the great weather and I can't ruin my eyes on the computer either! Does she expect me to wake up everyday and play on the guitar and watch TV?! If I watch TV, she'll say I'm lazy. If I play on the guitar, she'll say I'm being too loud and that she's trying to sleep. If I go online, she'll say I'm supposed to be grounded. If I clean up my desk, then I'll be done within 5 minutes and have nothing to do. If I clean up the house, she'll tell me to not to because I'll make things worse. If I go bug my sister (for entertainment) she'll say I'm misbehaving. If I talk on the phone she'll say I talk on the phone too much. She's ruining my fuckin social life. I don't think she realizes that. This would be the perfect time to run away from home, you know that? But I can't miss my Sudbury trip so I'll wait until after that.   You don't see anybody else's moms fussing over the "rain" hurting them at PCW! But nooo! MY mom has to fuss over it! If my friends aren't gonna get hurt from the rain, I'm not either, "MOM"! Geez...  I know that when my sister gets up to eat, she'll ask me why I'm not at PCW and I'll point outside and say "*in mock voice* It's raining. *rolls eyes* I'm gonna get sick from the rain." and my sister will say "But it's not raining! (my guess is that the rain will hold off until tomorrow)" and I'll say "No! Can't you see?! It's raining sooo hard! (notice the sarcasm dripping off every word)" and that'll piss my mom off so badly. Do you know what'll happen after she gets pissed? She'll yell at me and ground me from anything she can ground me from. Probably make me stay in my room all day except for meals. Oh joy. It's not like I can do anything in this house anyway. I can't go anywhere. I'd go to Moca's but she's working on her costume. Otherwise, I'd be more than happy to do band practise at her place.  If it doesn't rain at 12pm, I'm gonna try making my mom drive me to PCW and call Kryss to tell me where they're at so I can catch up. I'd do ANYTHING to get outta this hell. Boring me to death.   Wasting so many seconds of my life. Life is SHORT, you gotta enjoy every single moment of it with every opportunity you get! Now is one of those opportunities. Wtf...  Fuck this I hate her.  My sister just came into my room. She asked why I wasn't at PCW. I told her it was "raining". She didn't see any rain either. It's semi-sunny outside... just a few clouds. Geez... I hate this. For once, she's on my side.

Rain's not gonna fuckin hurt me, for goodness sake.   Wtf... "Ooh noo! It's raiiining! It's gonna kill me!" See? It doesn't make sense. Wtf... well I'm gonna go now... blog later.

      Wtf... I'm so POed. My mom wouldn't let me go to PCW with all my friends 'cos it's gonna rain. -__-" Omg... it's only rain. Sure, there'll be a thunderstorm later but so?! What's a thunderstorm gonna do to me?! The most that'll happen will probably be me getting a cold! Rain = water! Water can't hurt me! I'll just wear a hat and bring a windbreaker! Jeez! Wtf?! Vivo, Kryss, Candace, and Mark already left and they're on the way there. Martin's gonna go soon, and I'm supposed to drive Nima and Alice. If I can't go, they won't have rides. I don't know if Nima can get his parents to drive him and Alice but yeah. I hate it. Now if Nima and Alice don't have a ride, they won't be able to go either. Fuck it. I wanted to go really badly. "Go on Monday" she says... psht... Monday's Victoria Day! There'll be like tons of people! Today is gonna rain so there won't be as many people!  My mom is so... blah. What's a little rain gonna do to me?! It's not like I'm gonna get struck by lightning! Hello?! Geez... I'm not a kid anymore. Wtf... so POed right now.

      So bored... home alone. Sister went outside with friends and I'm just... here. LoL! Talking to Alice, Chris, and Elbert on MSN. Wow, haven't spoken to Elbert in ages! Met 2 years ago at Delia's place! We all had a sleepover together at Delia's and stuff. Went to Elbert (who was sleeping in Delia's room) and woke him up... but he was too sleepy to go eat ice-cream with us. Haha! Good times! Chris broke up again. *sighzZ* Poor kid. He's cool, but I don't know why he keeps getting dumped! Maybe he should go for Ingrid! LoLzZ~!  Jay talked to me a while before and asked if I was going to Bethel but I told him I couldn't. Had to babysit my sister. Bah humbug!   Nima was last seen at the park. I miss him... We talked about going outside today after school but yeah. Forgot about it. Whatever. I think he's with Jordan. Blahh.  Haha! Alice is so funny! "la" LMAO~! So yeaah. Hmm, maybe I'll call Elbert after school. It'll be long distance though. He's all the way in USA! Blah.  On the phone with Roger. Talking about band, PCW, the usual... haha! So many brothers! Muahahaha! Wweeeee! I'm high.. okay I'll shut up now.

      Well, what can I say? I got home a while ago... probably around 3:30pm. Nima wasn't at school for the first half of the day. I was soo freakin worried! But yeah... he came at lunch time so that was good. Got home and microwaved some Shepherd's Pie. Home alone with sister so I'm not going to Bethel tonight. Can't leave her all alone at home. So here I am: in front of the computer, sipping lemon tea. I'm so bored.   I talked to Ioana about the contest today at school and we've gotten Roger to join our group to try out for the thing. I want to try really hard on this. *sighzZ* Blah.  Going to PCW tomorrow. Driving Alice and Nima. Mark got a ride from somebody. So yeah... we'll arrive a little bit late because Alice doesn't have a season pass and she's gonna get a one-day ticket so that's cool.  Talked to Alice at recess today and it was... interesting. I didn't know what to say but I learned a lot from this. So yeah. Keeping all my friends in my prayers.  I haven't posted on SD for a while. I'm just gonna post here from now one unless something major happens. I'm not posting on my personal personal one either. Haha...  Oh yeah, we had a Sudbury meeting today in the library and yeah... Rodway, Sandiford, Cruickshank, McDaid, Mann, and Oberoi. Why isn't Tsokas coming? He's funny! Haha! Most important thing is that Nima's there. Hee hee~ So yeah. Rodway's (my) class is getting split on the busses. Damn. Julie and I wanted to trade 'cos she wanted to be with Rach and Delia and I wanted to go with Nima. Haha! So we talked to Rodway even though Sandiford said no trading. Rodway talked to us after school and she's gonna see what she can do. GO RODWAY! DON'T LET SANDIFORD STEAL YOUR WIND! Haha! Jokes~ But yeah... I hope we'll be able to switch. Rodway wrote down that Julie wanted to trade because she "didn't have any friends" on Bus B. I saw her write down "(Nima)" beside my name as the reason and I'm like *blush*! Haha! She did NOT have to write that down! But yeah... It was really weird. Blah. It was funny though. I guess she isn't as bad as I though. Rodway I mean. After that blow-up with Julie and I, she seems to be a bit nicer to the both of us.  *sighzZ* Boredom... I'm gonna DIE~ Gonna download some more songs on Kazaa Lite and listen to music... Tired from playing guitar yesterday... fingers throbbing.   I miss Nima. *sighzZ* He's so... Nima. (its a good thing) Perfect guy. Everything about him is PERFECT :) Ashegetam.

      Wow... I got my mom on the computer with me and found out I had signed up for the WRONG CONTEST! Haha! I found the right one and am currently discussing this with my band members. They want Gordon on drums but Gordon is too conceited! We might fail...! I don't know... we'll have to do this! Deadline for sign-ups is June 11!   First prize - $1000 and trophy Second prize - $800 and trophy Third prize - $500 and trophy Best instrumentals - $100 and trophy Best lyrics - $100 and trophy  If we make the auditions, we'll be performing on August 15 at La Rosa Grand Hall & Restaurant! Geez, I want to go sooo badly! This can get us somewhere! First prize winners get their song on a CD and it'll be sold in places! That would DEFINITELY bring us somewhere... pleeeeaaaase! Even a LITTLE publicity can get us noticed! Argh! I wanna do this soo bad! Even more badly than getting a cowboy hat! This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Please pray for us!  Well, I'm gonna continue talking about this to my friends... blog later.

      Nima called on the phone a while ago. Around 5-ish? I dunno. I just got off the phone with Martin. Had to get him to translate something for me in Chinese. Haha! I couldn't read the Chinese online! It was the registration for the song-writing thing. I wasn't sure what was supposed to go where so I had to ask someone who knew Chinese better than I did. Haha! I'm gonna check again with my mom later. Just in case.  Read AL's blog and yeah... phew... itf's wise! I guess things that happen teach you a lesson and some people actually learn and take it all in. Itf's a smart kid... Itf knows what to do.  Oh my gosh! FTV just called me! The radio station thing with the song-writing contest! They called regarding my registration and they asked if I would be able to make it to Vancouver since they're recording the performances on TV there and I'm like: "NOOOO!" 'cos my mom would never let me go! *sighzZ* Oh well... maybe next time.   Disappointment... *sighzZ* I actually thought that this might be able to bring our band somewhere. Oh well. Whatever. Maybe next time? They have a contest every I-don't-know-how-many years and soon we'll be old enough to go to Vancouver so whatever.  *sighzZ* That taught me something. Don't put your hopes up too high. Oh well. Whatever.   Oh yeah, back to the Nima's call thing. He called to see if I wanted to go outside with him and Mark but I doubted my mom would've let me so I said no. Just stayed home and worked with the guitar.  Bruce just came online. Haha... talking to him right now. My mom is having second thoughts about letting me go on Saturday! 'Cos it's supposedly gonna rain. I personally don't mind the rain but my mom's afraid I'll get sick. *sighzZ* It's supposedly gonna rain on both Sunday and Saturday. Oh my gosh! It's like gonna so ruin my hair! Haha! Preppyness! Anyway... *sighzZ* So tired and bored. I wonder what we're having for dinner? Iunno... blah.  Gonna go back to talking to Alice and Brucey... I'm off for now.

      School was okay... as usual. SSDD. Got that from Wilfred/Nathan. Same Shit Different Day. Yup. I had a tummy ache. :( It hurtttts. Oh well... it feels a little better now after some chocolate ice-cream. You know what? My sister dropped the whole box of gummy bears and wasted it all! Geez... thanks a lot Julie. *roll eyes* I liked those gummy bears too! :(  Nima's hurt... *sighzZ* I hope he'll get better soon. I wanted to talk to certain people today but oh well... didn't get the chance to.   Oh my gosh... I'm so pissed off at Konez. Who the hell does she think she is?! She said that I didn't deserve Nima and that someone else would be better for him. She said it behind my back. (duh!) I don't know if I do deserve Nima or not (probably not) but the someone else would be better for him part...?! Psht! Bitch. Probably talking about PURPLE. (haha *dryly*) She acts all nice and casual around me when asking how things are with Nima and then talks behind my back like that. Dumb fuck.   There's a song writing contest from FairChild Radio Station, I think... My mom told me about it. The song HAS to be in English (yay!) and I'm thinking of joining with Moca and Nima. We could do this! If we actually end up joining, then we'll have to perform the song on TV... this might bring our group somewhere. I don't know... Nima and Moca are both busy tonight so I'm just gonna play around with my guitar tonight and hopefully start writing a melody. I've got a scary gothic rockish thing going on right now on my guitar. Haha... it'll sound wicked on electric guitar. Anyway... I'm gonna go work on it. Blog later. I'm off for now. Peace out.

      Talking to Nima on the phone right now. Had a pretty good shower. For some reason, my hand hurts. Dunno why. Blah.   I practised Sweet Dreams and American Pie on my guitar. Hee hee~ Coolness. I'm obsessed with the American Pie song.   I'm pretty friendly with Brian, Martin L, and Martin Y. I hope Nima doesn't mind. They're like... family. My brothers. They diss me and I diss them back. I punch them but they don't punch me back. We have our chinese jokes... they make me laugh. Haha... it's like being "one of the guys" with them. Their stupid comments are mad funny and yeah. They don't treat me like a girl and like I'm all delicate. We were throwing stuff down Brian's shirt and Martin mentioned throwing it down my shirt (only jokingly) and I'm like: "Yeah okay! I dare you! You'll get beat up if you do!" but I know he didn't mean it. It was only meant to be a joke. Not to be taken seriously. We played rock paper scissors and whoever lost had to take of a piece of clothing and they dared me to play and I said okay since I had a jacket, a tank top, and another spaghetti strap under that. So we played and I only took off my jacket. Martin Y and Brian had to take off their shoes. Martin Y had to take off his glasses. Haha... they're hilarious. Weirdos... brothers :)  It's like Nima and Alice, kind of. They're best friends... Martin Y, Martin L, and Brian aren't my best friends but they're good buds of mine. Brothers! ^^ Haha...!  Nima if you don't like me hanging out with them then it's okay too. I don't mind not hanging out with them. There are always my girl friends. :) Let me know if you're uncomfortable with it okay?  Well that's it for tonight. Blog tomorrow.

      I just read Alice's blog. It's so... blah. Can't say anything. Not even on SD. I'll post elsewhere for this one. But one thing I should say...  Alice if you're reading this, I want you to know I'm always there if you need to talk. Pray =)  So many things make me realize so much. And everything makes me so sad. The way so many people can't see such simple things. We study our asses off to get into university to get a good job to get our children into a good school to get into university to get a good job and the cycle goes on and on. There are so many solutions that people don't realize. I'm not really as dumb as I pretend to be. I think a lot. Probably too much for my own good. But I still do think. Some people realize things that others don't. Things that can fix up so many problems... Iunno... I'm just yapping away now... well, dinner's ready. I'll blog tomorrow maybe. I'm off. PeAcE~

      Went to school today as usual. We went to BSS for orientation. The principal, vice-principal, superintendant, student council president, and the head prefects spoke to us before we went to take a tour of the school with the assigned prefects. The barbeque there was okay. Met a lot of friends from BHES, and SSPS. Friends that used to come to RRPS was now in SSPS and we met up and talked. Same old Timothy, JinWoo, Danny [aka PC], Anthony, Eric, Amin, Edan, and Kammie. Some things never change... Haha. They're a great bunch to hang out with. I miss them. Blah. I'll see 'em in BSS next year! Haha. There were so many bugs at the barbeque. Scaryness. Hmm, saw Joel there too. Talked to him a bit. Wanted him to teach me how to say "See ya later" in Korean. Damn, he wouldn't teach me. Lazy butt. Haha! Blah.  I talked to some people during lunch and stuff. Including Tracy's mom. Dunno why she talked to me but yeah. I'll keep what she said to me in mind. Talked to some other people including Moca and Zoe and people. Very interesting... Blah. I'll know what to do and stuff. Haha. Told Nima not to play basketball at recess since he did so much yesterday and kinda hurt himself. He didn't listen. Oh well. Whatever. Do what you want. I'm definitely gonna go for guitar next year. I dunno... I wanna try vocals though. Might join the choir. I know I don't sing well but I wanna try to improve what little I know about singing. My mom would never let me get vocal lessons anyway. Oh well, whatever. Might get Brian to join our band 'cos of his keyboard/piano skills. It's a good idea. Moca doesn't think he's the "band" type but whatever. I'm gonna ask if he wants to come to our next band practise.  To be honest, I don't really think Safee is... you know. Didn't scream the way I thought he would. Like Chester. From Linkin Park, I mean. So anyway... maybe a little more hoarser? I don't know. Whatever. I'm no singing/screaming expert.   Hmm, Hillsongs concert or Blink-182 concert? I wanna go to both but I don't think I'll be allowed. Hillsongs is a Christian band and Blink-182 is just rock. Iunno. I'll think about it. Damn, the Hillsongs concert is tomorrow, I think. I wanna go!  Just spoke to my sister about Megha. What a weird little girl. She's gotta learn that you can't just go up to someone and tell them that you think their boyfriend's hot. Whatever.  Julie told me it was Dan's birthday this weekend. Cool. I'm gonna go tell him happy birthday whenever it is. Haha.   This coming Saturday we're going to Wonderland. Yup. It's gonna be cool. So many people going. Blah. I just don't like line-ups. Haha! Oh well. Whatever.   You know what? I noticed that I like the phrase "whatever" a lot. Yay. Anyway... so yeah.  Stayed after school with Nima and we just... walked around. After Octi and stuff. He and Boris were supposed to fight but they called it off. Weirdos. So yeah. Nima walked me home and yeah. I think my neighbors saw us hug. LoLzZ~! Well whatever. My mom knows about it so yeah. Even if they tell my mom it's like: "...Okay, and...?"  Blah. Oh well. I'm so bored. Blogging again. Haha! I started this blog entry around 4:30-ish and now it's 5:15 lmao! Weird. Anyway... Nima found my lost_diary account on fanfix and yeah. He said he wouldn't read it if I told him not to and yeah. I trust him. If he says he's not gonna read it then okay.   Nikki and Moca had this fight again. Jeez, people's gotta learn to chillax. Talk calmly instead of screaming. Nikki... I don't like her attitude. She's changed a lot and a lot of stuff she says and stuff bugs me. It all just started with the whole Persian pride thing. Same with Moca. She's changed a little and it's not for the better. Or maybe I'm the one whose changed? I don't know. But... I feel like I'm growing apart from Moca. Oh well. At least I still have one best friend that will never leave me. GOD.

      On the phone with Nima right now. I have to go soon, and so does he. I'll just wait until he has to go. Golly, I miss him so much. Bayview Orientation tomorrow. Tour the school, have several people speak to us, and then barbeque. Damn, I haven't done my Science yet. That sucks. *sighzZ* I don't feel like doing my Science. Today was really messed so yeah. But everything turned out okay as it always does.   I love Nima. He's so... perfect. Beyond perfect. I love him so much. Everything that happens makes us even stronger, in my opinion. Well, he just got off the phone to go to bed. I should go do my chores and turn in too.   AL has her SA problems and SA POs so easily. I really think AL should end this. Before they get hurt. She deserves SO much better than him. But she loves him. I know. :( *sighzZ* Gonna pray for her. I'm so grateful that God has blessed me with Nima. The best gift God has ever given me. Nima doesn't PO everytime I talk to him about stuff and be honest with him. Nima I love you. POS. Bye.

      Just got home from guitar class. Called Nima back 'cos my sister said that he called. We talked. He told me he blogged 3 times. Wow... that's rare. Seriously. Anyway... We talked a bit and stuff like that. I love him. Honestly I really really do. I'm sorry for ever hiding that dumb blog but yeah. It was just stuff I wanted to clear outta my head. It wasn't meant to be hidden. 'Cos that's the place where I blow off MAJOR steam. Anyway... I didn't mean to hurt him. I'm sorry Nima... Please don't let out your emotions by working out too intensely. You're gonna hurt yourself badly like that... and you know how I feel about you hurting yourself... I love you and you mean so much to me! I can't even start to describe how I feel about you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for ever hiding anything from you, for ever hurting you, and for doing anything and everything that makes you unhappy. I'm sorry. You have no idea how sorry I am. I love you. I have to go to dinner now. Blog later... tomorrow.   To make a long story short, I LOVE YOU Nima... I mean it. Never forget... the last thing you do.

      At home... I was talking to Nima on the phone but we hung up when he said he wanted to go for a walk. Wonder why... *sighzZ* Oh well. I'd have gone on a walk ages ago if my mom let me. So many things my mom doesn't let me do. I miss him. Wish he hadn't gone. Said he'd call me back later on tonight but I doubt it. He might forget like usual or I'd miss his call from being at guitar class.   Should I type out what's wrong on here?... I'm tempted but I'll probably only type out the minor things. The major stuff I'll leave for myself. Where should I start? Hmm...  Well first of all, I think, or should I say KNOW, that Nika likes Nima. I think she still likes him a lot. When I say a lot, I mean A LOT! Anyway... so let's go back in time a bit... according to my resources, Nima and Nika went out last year, I think. Someone said that they broke up after one week of being together. People say that Nima said he didn't really like Nika but only went out with her because she liked him A LOT. Then Nima put "I LOVE _ _ _ _" in his nickname on MSN and Nika thought it was supposed to be her name so she liked him again. She also wrote "N" on her desk once and someone asked why "N" and she said something about "N" being the person she liked. Another thing is that she stares at Nima in class. Any class. In Science, she stares at him non-stop. It's kinda scary. I don't know if anybody else noticed [Kryss and Moca knows] but Nika ALWAYS ends up close to Nima. She's always behind, beside, or in front of Nima. "Coincidence? Fat chance."   A third thing is that I think Konez tried to stop Nima and I getting together for her friend Nika. Why else would she have made up all that crap about Nima and piss me off? Probably because her friend likes him and wants to help her friend out? Interesting...  A [wise person] had  this  opinion on this situation, or rather our relationship... (WP = Wise Person, and I'll say "it" instead of "him" or "her")  WP thinks that Nima is with me because he likes the attention I give him and that he's too nice to admit it. Maybe he's going out with me because I liked him a lot? Another bizarre possibility. WP thinks he's only acting and it observed that his attitude towards Moca and I are the SAME.   I don't know... I thought about WP's opinion a lot and it really made me think. I came to accept that it IS a possibility but after washing my hair and taking a nice, warm, comforting shower, I changed my mind. I am going to disregard that possibility because  I trust Nima.  I trust him when he tells me he loves me. I trust him when he says he cares. Therefore, that is over with and is merely WP's opinion. I should not have done something so foolish as to even take it into consideration. [No offense to ____]To be EXTREMELY honest TO THE MAX, I cannot help but agree to the statement regarding his attitude towards us.   I am either paranoid or I am losing it completely. [S-Gurl] might get POed and just get annoyed with me but you know what? I'm really tired of this. I'm tired of her getting annoyed at me for the things I do. She is a great friend but you know what? I can't stand it sometimes. I'm ME. I'm PARANOID, A BRAT, BITCHY, AND EVERYTHING YOU SAY I AM. Okay?! Accept me for me. Otherwise, please do not PO everytime I do something that annoys you. So many things YOU do annoy me and piss me off but I don't ever blow up at you OR snap at you! Give me a freakin break! Okay, let's get back on topic.  Am I being too blunt? Being too honest? Being too paranoid? Care too much? Or do I love him too much? I don't know... you tell me what I am. But after reading this, I am 100% SURE that Nima agrees I am anyting BUT perfect. Sorry Nima... you wanted me to be honest. Here I am. I could never get myself to say all this to you... therefore, that is why you're reading my blog.  Also, I just remembered... Nika was beside Nima during art class too. He was sitting with Nikki, Nika, Konica, Kellie, Alena, Mayhar, and all those people. Most of them were "Persian". *rolls eyes* I am so freakin sick of this "PERSIAN PRIDE WORLD WIDE" thing. Next time Nikki does that, I'm probably gonna start spazzing at her. I admit I used to say "AZN PRIDE" but I don't do that anymore. I knew it was racist. Okay, back to the Nika thing. So yeah... I don't like how Nika is always beside Nima or whatever. In fact, it bugs me... am I jealous? Probably. But you know what? I'm past the point where I'm hiding my jealousy. If and when I'm jealous, I post it all on here. Good idea? Definitely.   After letting this all out on my blog, I feel a lot better and also a lot worse. I feel like a totally jealous and paranoid bitch bitchy brat. I really do. Fuck it... I shouldn't have said anything anyway. 5:30... one more hour until guitar lessons. Won't be back until 8:00pm. Borrrring. Well, I'm off for now. This is probably the longest blog I've typed up. Too bad Nima's on his "walk", otherwise, I'd call him and tell him to read this. Well, I'll blog later. Gonna exercise a bit.  Nima, after reading all that up there, I want you to know that I'm sorry. You have no idea how sorry I am. Also know that I love you, and it's true. Otherwise, I wouldn't be so paranoid, jealous, and I wouldn't care so freakin much. I hope you understand. Asheghetam. I mean it. Please... don't ever forget. No matter what happens.

      On the phone with Nima. He called after he got home. Blah. I should talk to him about the [thing] but yeah. Maybe tomorrow. Not on phone. Not good... Dunno if I really should though. So hard. Complications. Blah. *sighzZ* So... weird? Can't think properly right now. Paranoidness? I don't know. Just those occassional feelings of uncertainty, probably. Some regarding "cough". Don't know if he noticed that she was walking home behind him. Oh well... she always ends up close to him. Don't like it. Oh well. Nothing I can do. Whatever's happened has happened. Can't do shit about it.   Stuff... on my mind. Talked to certain people about it. I was gonna talk to Alice about it 'cos she seemed like a good person to turn to but will she tell Nima? They're best friends and all... iunno. Got some responses from certain people... I dunno. I'll see.

      20 minutes until band practise. Rach sent me a chatlog and an epilogue and it was so deep.   Talked to some people today and it made me even more conscious of how lucky I am to have Nima. I love him and I know that he loves me too. He cares for me as I care for him and there's nothing more I can ask of him. I love him so much. This... is different. Different from what I had with Wilfred. This is more than that. At first, I thought that I wouldn't like a guy my age for a while because guys my age are so immature, but I guess I was wrong. Nima is probably the most mature guy in grade 8. I love him. He's the best thing God has blessed me with. He's perfect. Beyond perfect yet perfection beyond description. When I tell him I love him, I mean it. Always.   [Of all the things I regret, sometimes I forget to say... I love you]  Nima, if you're reading this, I want you to know that I really do mean it when I say I love you. I don't ever say things that I don't mean unless it's to wastebucket or Lohan or anyone else I hate but never to you. Don't ever forget... Je t'aime... jamais n'oublie pas. C'est vrai.  I talked to Alice today and she gave Vivo and I permission to talk to Safee. I think he's upset. But you know what? He deserves all this... he should stop doing what Alice tells him not to do. He continues to flirt and stuff. I told him to keep his distance from girls and I hope he stops. Alice deserves better than him... really. Gonna pray for her.  Well, I should start packing to pick people up to band practise. Adios.

      Wow! It was sooo much fun today! Went outside rollerblading with Moca. Grabbed my guitar and we saw Celia and Azra too. We played some music in the shade of the portables and Daniel joined us. Then we played music in the park while Dan and Ronen played basketball. Ronen, Moca, and I went to my house to drop off my guitar and I got Moca some water. Then we set out to Wal-Mart and sent Ronen in to get Moca a McFlurry and he got me a sundae. Yum! ^^ We played TRUTH OR DARE all the way there and all the way back. Then Ronen went to play basketball with Octi and Mark and people and Moca, Dan, and I played TRUTH OR DARE. We hung out there while we finished our desserts and then Dan walked us to my house and we hung out inside while Moca had some water. We joked around a lot. Little Benin is a hilarious guy... that little frigger. Haha! When we got into the house, Nima called. He had gotten home. So we talked on the phone while Moca and Dan joked around. Dan somehow got the idea that Moca liked him... yeaaah suuuuure. LmAozZ~! Roofles~   I missed Nima so much. I wanna see him and give him a hug. :( Blah... school tomorrow. Omg... I still haven't done my lab report or Outsider questions... or my math! I'm a bad bad girl! Hee hee!  Well, they're all gone now... just me at home... and my sister... and grandpa. Mommy's out at Asta's. *sighzZ* So freakin hot... My sunburn on my shoulder hurts a bit. You know what? I found out I had $5 in change and I'm gonna get my sister to pay for the other $5 for my cowboy hat! Hee hee~ I hope my mom lets me go back to the Promenade this coming weekend to get that cowboy hat for Sudbury! :D  Wish me luck y'all! Well, I'm a bit tired... gonna have some ice-cream, shower, and take a nap!   [Peek-a-boo!!! LMAO!!! MOCA/DAN]

      Just had a late lunch... cooked noodles.  Well, Moca and I and some people are probably gonna go rollerblading to the school park so yeah. Gonna call Moca and go now... Julie's such a fuckin brat. A bigger brat than even me. Grandpa's talking to her, telling her to give him the bowl so he can wash it but she's ignoring him even though she heard him say it. She just continued talking on the fuckin phone. What a bitch... If that kid wasn't my sister, I'd have fuckin beat her up already.   Trying to call Nima at his cell. Oh well. Dunno if it works... *sighzZ* I wanna talk to him before I go out. Moca just got outta the shower so yeah. Gotta wait for her. Nobody answering... I'll just hang up. Oooh he picked up... haha. Oh well... he said he'd call back after a while. Blah... oh well. I should go now... bye bye. Blog laters.

      On the phone with Nima right now. Told him that I found his blog entry... and it hurts. You'd probably go: "why the hell would it hurt?!" I'll tell you how it hurts... it hurt that he kept it from me. That he wasn't honest with me. I was honest with him about the Nathan thing because I wanted HIM to, in turn, be honest with me. But he wasn't. It hurt that he kept that from me. I asked him what was wrong before and he never said anything. Now I know... after reading it. But... I won't know anymore whether he's being honest with me or not... he probably won't blog there anymore or type out his feelings and worries/troubles. I wouldn't know if he was hiding anything... That's what I don't like... he wanted me to be comfortable around him and stuff but... I can't do that without honesty, and being open with each other. I've gotten myself to be totally honest with him about everything and I'm totally open with him about anything... but he kept that from me. Even though he says he won't do that anymore and would be honest, I don't think he will. He probably will just hide everything and not even blog it out... *sighzZ* Fuck it... nothing I can do. Wish I could change it and never have told him I knew.

      Hmm, dinner was okay. We had take-out and just... rice. Typical chinese dinner. Talking to Mark, Vivo, and Julie on MSN. Told Julie about the cowboy hat I fell in love with and now she's telling me about Troy. Damn, I wanted to watch Troy but mommy won't let me. Vivo and Mark are gone now so yeah. Can't stop talking about the cowboy hat! Haha! I'm so weird.   Well, church tomorrow! Sunday worship. Hmm, what should I do after worship? Not much to do... I'll probably be stuck at home with nothing to do while the weather may be really good outside. Oh... speaking of good weather... I got sunburns on my shoulders. It's so gay. Mommy says I gotta avoid getting a tan because tanned skin doesn't go with my beige dress. Damn... I wanted to get a tan on my arms and face and then a small sunburn on nose and cheeks! Hee hee~   Ooh~ Vivo's back! Talking to her on MSN now. Julie stopped for some reason. Oh well. So yeah... Hmm, should update the songs on my MP3 player... blah, too lazy. Hee hee!  Now that I think about it, I got a few "girly"-ish tops today. Haha... kinda surprising myself. Oh well. There was this t-shirt I got from H.M. and 2 other tops I got from this shop full of preppy clothing. Haha! I'm so weird.  I like the "girl next door" look. By the phrase "girl next door", I don't mean like the movie "THE GIRL NEXT DOOR"! I mean like... a hometown girl-ish outfit. Like... what I wore today. Nothing too preppy, slutty, tomboy-ish, or anything! Just... the girl next door! Nice simple grey spaghetti strap [no logos], pair of blue jeans [no logos], blue shirt around the waist [tiny logo], and normal white running shoes. Haha! It's so casual but... nice. I like it a lot. That combination, I mean. Haha!  Geez, why in the world am I talking so much about clothes? I just go on and on and on! Somebody PLEEAAASE shut me up! I talk too much. Yes, I realized that... not just now though. Like, I noticed it ages ago. I just don't stop! See what I mean? Phew! I gotta shut up for once! Maybe not talk for one whole day! Nah... too hard! I always have a comment about anything and everything!   Back to my other topic... it's gonna be pretty boring tomorrow! I'll type out my scheduel...  8:30am - eat breakfast 9:00am - watch a bit of tv 9:20am - get picked up 9:30am - go to worship 10:50am - worship ends, hang out time 11:15am - hop onto the bus and go to BHES 11:30am - CD team at BHES 12:30pm - take the bus back to RHCBC 12:45pm - get home 1:00pm - eat lunch 1:30pm - go back on computer  Then after 1:30 there's not much for me to do. Maybe I'll go outside with some friends... hmm, I wonder if Moca will feel like going outside... or grab some sportier friends and play some basketball? Maybe... Haha~ I'm so indecisive!   Yes... anyway... what else is there to talk about? Hmm, still "debating against my conscience". I know that I should do a certain thing but if I do that, it can lead to a good AND bad result... I know an alternate way of getting around this but... the best thing to do is tell the truth although I don't think I should. [if you're reading this and is complete confuzzled, then whatever... this part is for myself]I don't want it to happen but I gotta fix this somehow without revealing the source...? *sighzZ* Screw it. Whatever. Don't know what to do about. Usually, I'd say that if I don't know what to do about it, then it's best to do nothing at all... but in this case, I can't do nothing about it. Impossible. Gotta fix it somehow to avoid misunderstandings.

      Just got back a little while ago from shopping 6 hours straight. Feet hurt so fuckin much. Looked around for shoes for grad, but not very successful. However, I did buy some cool spaghetti strap tops, tank tops, jackets, and a pair of cool skateboarding short-ish pants things. Bumped into Azra at Urban Planet and we said hi. Got my sister 3 jackets (2 blue, 1 grey) and I fell madly in love with a light blue COWBOY HAT! It costed $30. I had $20 on me and didn't have enough. My mommy looked like she was willing to buy it for me since it looked pretty nice... especially with my outfit today [grey spaghetti strap, blue jeans, checkered blue jacket tied around my waist] but she said that if she got that for me, then it'd be my birthday present and she won't get anything else for my birthday. I changed my mind because I'd still rather have an electric guitar. I'm not as in love with the guitar as the cowboy hat but I thought about it and knew it was better in the long run. I could use the guitar and praise the name of the LORD through music and it's better for my musical education than just my appearance. *sighzZ* I guess I'll just save up $10 more and then go to Promenade to get it. I've been wanting to get a cowboy hat when I was 3 years old! Damn, I ain't gonna give up this opportunity! It's so cool! I've been here last year and I've been eyeing that hat already! *sighzZ* Soon... soon.   Got back from shopping and went on MSN. Talked to Vivo and she said she went outside with Mark, Nima, Alice, Safee, Octi, and Jordan. I'm surprised they only sat around playing Truth or Dare. She told me Nima kissed Mark and Safee on the cheek. Gross... Seriously. I love this guy but it's a total turn-off when he kisses his guy friends. I'm NOT kidding...! I was about to  PUKE  when I read that he kissed them. If he kissed some girl then I'd just get pissed but kissing his guy friends... ewness. I know it's probably a dare but... ew. Did I say ew? I'm sorry, I mean   EWWWWWWWW  ! *choke choke gag gag puke*   Let's change the topic before I lose my lunch... I need my appetite for dinner. Well, yesterday I did some stuff... Hmm, speaking of yesterday, I'd better also blog about last night at Bethel.   Okay, last night at Bethel, we made sushi! It was a lot of fun. We talked, joked, and made sushi! Totally cool. All Martin and Brian did was eat the leftovers and the odd ends of the sushis. I didn't really know much about making sushi so I helped skin the cucumber, chop it up, and made 1 roll of sushi and stopped. I ended up just helping out here and there and joking around with Martin and Brian. Yelled at Martin as usual and Brian jokingly dissed me [as usual] and I sprayed water at him. Instead, I ended up cupping my hand and filling it with water, then I just threw a lot of water on him, making him ALL wet! Haha! Funnyness. Auntie Amy just sat there and laughed her head off. It was soo funny! I got some on Martin too. Hilarious. I think the water thing all started when Brian wiped something on my arm. Haha! Oh well, as long as we all had fun. We ended up finishing our designs and team 1 won! Oh well. We sat together and ate it all up. Kenneth [Wilfred's bro] kept coming to have a few sushis while playing basketball. Oh... I just remembered... I wanna ask Brian Y. for a copy of our sushi. He took a pic of our sushi with his cell. Joanna keeps coming to Bethel now because she wants to see Derek. She thinks he's cute...! Haha! Funnyness. So yeah... I didn't like the shirt that Sally had on. Made her look like a ho. Talked to Zoe in the washroom and I told her some stuff. *cough* Same with Priss. Well, talked to Priss outside though...   This morning at Chinese school, Vivo wasn't there! Haha... not surprised. Jeff got switched to the back and ended up sitting behind us. Him and Janice. They had to do their exams. Muahahaha! Suckerssss~! JkzZ~! We helped Jeff cheat a bit since he's a nice guy anyway and we messed around with his cap. Lmao! Hat hair!!! Looks HILARIOUS without his cap. So yeah... Talked to Zoe a bit today at Chinese school and Yvonne came late. Auntie Yvonne~ Hee hee!  *sighzZ* Can't get my mind off the cowboy hat! >O  Geez, I'm so tired. Too lazy to get up and take a shower yet. I'll go later. Still feeling a bit unwell from what Vivo told me. Gross...   Konica wants me to show her what I got at the mall through webcam but I'm too lazy to get the stuff outta the bag... I don't wanna do webcam today... Not in the mood for anything. Miss my cowboy hat too much.  Got some stuff to think over... Blog later... It might be in SD, might not. Whatever. I'll see...   『 Debating Against My Conscience 』

      I'm freakin bored to death. I wanna call Nima to talk but decided against it. Always me calling and I really don't wanna seem like I'm annoying him. He'll call if he wants to talk. (duh... see? im being stupid again) So bored... I'll probably call Erica? Or Moca? Iunno... Blah. Just bored to death... period.  Still grossing out because of the kissing dare Nima got.

      6:50pm right now. Phew... it's so hot. Only 1 hour until Bethel! Julie was outside with her friends and they saw Nima and people playing basketball or something by the courts. Hmm, guess he's not home yet. *sighzZ* I guess he's not going to Bethel tonight. So much for hanging out with him at Bethel. I miss him so much...  Julie told me that one of her friends like Nima. Whoever's reading this blog of mine, please DO NOT say anything or I will seriously lose my fuckin trust in you! I promised to not say anything about it! So basically, this is in my online DIARY which nobody is allowed to say anything about. I know which friend of hers likes Nima but I'm not allowed to mention names. Julie asked me for Nima's picture so that her friend could have it. Yeah right. Nooo way! MY PICTURES! Muahahaha! A grade 6 kid likes my guy... hmm... should I consider this competition? LoLzZ~! Blah. JokingzZ~!  I love him so much. I love Nima. I don't like him, I love him. There's a difference. I'm so afraid of losing him and stuff... I trust him a lot more now. Seriously.   I can't wait until the Sudbury trip. It's gonna be so much fun! Especially because Nima's there. The dance thing is now CASUAL instead of SEMI-FORMAL. Damn the people who voted for casual! Joking~ But yeah... I like semi-formal a lot better. Its more fun! You get to dress up a little nicer than you do usually. *sighzZ* No telephone calls after 11pm [lights out]. I wanna talk to Nima on the phone before I go to bed... hee hee~ I'll have to call my mommy too. I wonder if long distance calls are allowed... I might call my daddy in HK.   Like I said before, I really don't think Nima knows how much I love him. When I tell him I love him, I want him to know that I really do mean it. I'd do ANYTHING for him. If he wanted me to, I'd even get over my fear of insects for him! Anything at all. I love him. Love beyond description.   I don't know how much Nima loves me but I know who loves me more than even my parents. GOD. He loves me even more than anyone! If I am tired, He'd listen to my whining. If I'm angry, He listens to my complaints and cussing. If I'm hurt, He heals me. If I have a broken heart, He'd be there to comfort me. When you break up, you might not always feel comfortable going to your parents, so you go to God. When you fall and injure yourself, you might not like your parents fussing over you like a baby... so God heals you. When you feel bad for something you've done, you ask God for forgiveness and it shall be given to you. Praise the LORD.  Since Nima's still out, I guess he's not going to Bethel... I'm gonna miss him so much. Last time, I didn't go to Bible Study because Nima wasn't going and I'd rather be at home than elsewhere with other people. So I skipped Bethel last time... I don't know if Nima's going to Bethel 'cos he might not have time for dinner if he's still out... so I guess I'm just gonna go this time. No more ditching God for Nima. God SHOULD BE my #1 priority. No more ditching God for anything.  I'm sorry LORD for the thing I've made it... but when it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of worship... but when it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus."  If Nima doesn't come, then whatever. I'll see him on Monday. I'm going to Bethel tonight, and there's no stopping me. Even if Nima's gonna call my house while I'm at Bethel. I ain't gonna wait for his phone calls anymore. Just gonna chillax with God. :)

      Got home a little while ago. Phew~ So hot! Actually, I got home pretty early... before 3:30. My mom drove my sister and I to Wal-Mart and we went in to get some water. We bought some water for our water machine thing that you usually find in office buildings. Very cool. Anyway... So yeah... when we drove there, I saw Nima still at the bench outside the school and when we came back, he was walking down Grover Hill. Missed him so much while I was gone. Couldn't stop thinking about him. Hee hee~ I'm crazy... about him.  So anyway... Got home and helped my mom carry the stuff into the house... so damn heavy. Then we put the thing together and then I went upstairs. I wanted ice-cream but was too lazy to get some. Went upstairs, turned on the computer, and checked my email. I read Jay's blog and he said something about these two guys in suits going up to his house and he found out that they were mormons. Oooh~ Coolness! Cool but scary. Cool only because they're weird. Don't like 'em. I talked to him on MSN about mormons (right now) and he explained to me that they're just weird people who are kind of Christian-ish. They make up stuff that aren't in the Bible. Kinda like the devil. Kinda scary. I'm grateful I've never met any mormons yet.  Spent lunch recess with Nima. I missed him and didn't get to talk to him too much so yeah... Hee hee~ I hope he didn't mind to had to have spent the entire lunch recess with me instead of playing basketball with his friends. I just like spending time with him... no matter where or when. I really hope he didn't mind. I know he'd rather be playing basketball though. Not gonna make him do that much anymore... hee hee.  Bethel tonight~ Yay! I wonder if Nima could come or not... I really hope he can. I know that his parents don't want him to belong to a religion and that he thinks he's too young to commit to one and I respect that. I only want him to come so that I can spend time with him. POP... in the gym. Wonder what's gonna be happening.  Haha! Still talking to Jay on MSN. He asked if Ingimon (Ingrid) is going to Bethel. She usually goes so yeah... told him that and he told me they made up an attack for her. LMAO! She spits out 3 gummy bears at her enemy. LMAO! GUMMY BEARS RULE! Her weakness is eating and sleeping. LmAozZ~! Funnyness! [inside joke] Gummy Bear Trio rox!  I miss Nima... He's so captivating. :) I love him so much... I swear, it's impossible for me to get annoyed or mad at him. I love him. I mean it too when I say that. Why else would I miss him so much?! I miss his brown eyes, his irresistable smile, his gentle touch, just everything about him. I love him so much.   He said he'd call me when he got home or whatever. Hee hee~ I wonder when he'll get home...! *yawnzZ* A little tired... but it's not gonna stop me from going to Bethel! Can't miss POP! Hee hee! Anyway... I'm gonna go back to talking to Konez and Jay... blog later. Bye bye~~   Note to Nima  I hope you don't mind me talking to him so much. If you do, let me know. It's nothing serious or whatever. He's just a really cool guy that I look at as a brother. Nothing more. :) Remember that I love YOU! XoXo~

      Omg! Sooo hot! I have a fan on outside my room between my sister's room and my room. Phew! Hotness! Sweating... ewwers! I'm so sticky! Anyway...   Just emailed Lisa. Yup, we talked about losing virginity and spaghetti straps and how hot it is in Texas! 30 something degrees! Whoa... I'd pass out in that temperature. Phewness~!  I miss Lisa a whole lot. I've never had a big sister... only a little sister. I've always had to teach her homework, teach her about boys, make-up, girl stuff... I've never had anyone to teach me that stuff... no one to ask for advice and stuff. I mean, yeah, you can always talk to friends but an older sister's different... someone you look up to. I'm really grateful for Lisa. I'm grateful that God blessed me with such a great friend and sister in Christ. She has guided so many people and been a great person to be around. I tell her everything and she gives really good advice. She's always been there for me... the only thing I didn't tell her about is the time when Wilfred went somewhere he wasn't supposed to go. Only thing. She was already "troubled" when I told her about us kissing. So if she knows about the "other thing" she'd totally freak out. Talked to Ingrid about this. Haha~!   There's... also this thing that happened to me a long time ago... but it always... bugs me. Nobody knows... only I do. Not planning on letting anybody else know. Scary... comes back to haunt me even years from the event. Like now. Don't wanna think about it... *sighzZ* Gonna take a shower.

      Oh my gosh... I was browsing online and looking at guitars while flipping through my guitar magazine... I remembered being totally obsessed with this really cool guitar... the ICEMAN GUITAR and the RANDY RHOADS RR1T! Oh my gosh! Total sexyness! Fuck, I want them! Dream guitars of mine... pics below.   Iceman IC400      Randy Rhoads RR1T     Oh my gosh... The Randy Rhoads RR1T might look crappy in that pic but in my magazine it is sooo fuckin sexy! Same with the Iceman guitar. Having either one of those will be like... dammmnnn...! Too bad, they cost thousands. My parents will never get 'em for me. :( I'll have to save up bit by bit. If I really want one, then it'd take me a few years of not going out or anywhere or spending ANY money whatsoever. :( *sighzZ* My only hope is this summer. MIGHT get electric guitar in the summer... MAYBE. I said I'd even give up getting a new bike if I get a guitar. I'd give up a new bike, new rollerblades, new hockey sticks, new PS, new computer, new anything! I just want an electric guitar! ...a BLACK one!... I like the Fender Stratocaster! It's nice! I like the Iceman more though, haha~! Oh my gosh... I really wannit sooo bad~~~! >O  Blah... enough day dreaming... I'm eyeing the Schecter Diamond Series SpitFire-6 right now! Damn, nice guitars! I want them sooo bad. >O

      On MSN right now. Talking to Nima on Jordan's accoutn and also talking to two guys I met on Friendster. Haha... they're so friendly. Nima looks just as cute on webcam. Jordan first signed on and he said stuff like "hey sexy" and "hey beautiful" and I was like: O__o" He tried to imposter Roger but that was really gay. Roger knew better than to do that when with Candace and we were on the phone so he told me it wasn't him. Hung up a little bit after that so now I'm talking on MSN. A bit hungry but mom's mopping downstairs. Can't go into the kitchen. Otherwise, I'd have ice-cream with me. Oh well. Doesn't matter. Just really hot right now... gonna change into a spaghetti strap later. Phew... Too bad we can't wear that at school. Annoyingness. I'll see if I'm gonna wear a tank top tomorrow... if it doesn't rain. Got Lisa's reply when checking my email. Yeah, she really thought I was gonna sleep with Nima and lose my virginity. NO WAY~! Silly Lisa. I love him but I'm not gonna fuck him! Right... moving right along...  I miss him. Nima, I mean. :( Even though he's on webcam I still miss him. :( *sighzZ* Oh well... Well he's on BRB, beating Jordan up or something. Whatever... just hope he won't get hurt... or get Jordan hurt. Jordan's already got his arm thingy screwed so yeah. Blah...  Nima blogged today in his agenda... haha. Longest blog in his agenda written by him. Of course, I obviously write more in my blogs than him. He writes so little and calls it a blog. Haha... such a cutie. Anyway... it's really really hot in here and I can't stand it... gonna change right now. >O  POP this Friday at Bethel. PLAN OWN PROGRAM. Angie and Brian won't tell us what they have planned. :( Blah... I hope Marcos won't be there. He hasn't called for a while so that's good. Godfrey's different. He's funny, unlike Marcos... he's freaky. So yup... *sighzZ* Whatever. I'll see what happens this Friday. It should be fun. I like hanging out with Angie and Brian. Hm, I wonder if Brian has Friendster. I have Derek's MSN but not Brian's... haha! Joanna's going back to Bethel this Friday 'cos she wants to see Derek. She thinks he's cute. LoLzZ~! Funnyness. I have to admit, he IS nice though... like in a big brother-ish way. But then again, he IS a big brother to Mich and Brian. Mich is like my sister so yeah.  Hmm, Bruce is online. Haha! Gonna talk to Brucey too... blog later.

      Nima said he'd call after school but still hasn't. Whatever. I can't remember... was it today that he was going out somewhere or was it Saturday? Awww, I really wanted him to come shopping with me since I really wanted a guy's perspective on the stuff I try on. *sniff sniffzZ* Oh well... Whatever. *sighzZ*   Kent went offline 'cos he had to go to school now. Checked out Jay's public blog today. Haha! Summer school... well it isn't that bad from the way he described it.   IngiEE reckons Chrissy has changed. Hmm, good point. He used to be a lot more fun to talk to... I don't know what happened. Oh well, he's growing up... give him space. :)  So bored... can't nap 'cos of my wet hair... so hungry. I hope we have something yummy for dinner~! >O

      I have a headache. Seriously. From computering... but I'm addicted. I have a headache from figuring out guitar tabs too... and also from my wet hair that I'm waiting for to dry naturally. And the loud rock music on my computer. >O  Argh~! I hate this.   Tired, headachey, sticky, hot, hungry... could this be any worse? I wanna go outside but noo my mom wouldn't let me. UghzZ~! We have the playing test tomorrow too! Wtf~ I didn't study. Too lazy to take the saxophone home. Too heavy, too hot, too tired, too lazy. Period. Why'd I have to pick the sax?! Sure, it's fun, but I shoulda taken a nice small instrument! Like... drums! Or... clarinet or flute! Wtf... stupid me. *bonks head*   You know what? I need ice-cream. BUT dinner's gonna be ready soon. Argh~! Soo annoying. My fingers hurt from guitaring and I don't want to touch my guitar now because my hands are sticky from the hotness. Screw it...   Ooooh~ Kent from Friendster added me on his MSN. Gonna talk to him now. Yay~ He saved me from boredom.

      Washed my hair and lightly braided it so that I could have a wavey effect on my hair tomorrow. Don't know if it'll turn out the way I want it to though. Oh well... if I don't like it, I'll just wash my hair again to straighten it out.   Hungry~ Hee hee~ Feel like having chips. Nah... bad for me. I'm such a junk food addict... with a sweet tooth too! You can obviously tell by my passion for chocolate ice-cream with chocolate chips topped with chocolate sauce. Yummy~ I need to buy chocolate sauce to go with my chocolate ice-cream and chocolate chips. Hee heezZ~! You can tell I love CHOCOLATE too! But you know what (or should I say WHOM) I love more than chocolate? NIMA~ That's right! ^^   Walked home with Nima and he said he'd call. Still hasn't. Blah, it's all good. He's doing homework, probably. History notes due tomorrow~! PhewiezZ~!   Wow, I killed my fingers badly yesterday, trying to learn the chords for BEHIND BLUE EYES. >O  Speaking of guitar, I met a guy on Friendster who also has a passion for music, especially the guitar. He messaged me and asked me to add him since we both like guitars. Coolness eh? Power of FRIENDSTER~! ^^ I added Nima's pic into my gallery in Friendster. Only Nima's grad pic though. :P   I miss him. Blah. So tired... taking a break. Blog later... maybe.

      At school right now. Computer class again. Wow, it's so hot today! Phew! I wanted to wear my tank top but my mom won't let me because it was supposed to rain today. -O-" No rain so far~ Oh well. Gauss math test today. People who didn't do the test stayed in 8R and watched Mrs. Doubtfire. Haha... Funny movie. Doubtfire reminded me of M_____. Roofles! Speaking of M_____, she's across the hall in the primary pod. Weirdness. Anyways... so yeah. Everybody's tired today 'cos of the heat. Funny eh? You feel sleepy and won't get up when it's cold and when it's warm or hot out, then you still feel all tired and stuff. Crazyness.   We talked a bit about the semi-formal dance at Sudbury and Rodway mentioned that we didn't have to wear skirts or dresses or whatever but yeah... I'm gonna wear a long flowy-ish black skirt and I'm looking for a top to go with it too! Hmm, yup. Can't wait until Saturday when I go shopping for it. The top, I mean. I'm probably going to look for a new silver ring too. Might get it engraved. Haha... Iunno. If I DO get the ring, guess what I'm gonna engrave on it? Hee heezZ~ I lost my favourite silver ring so I wanna get a new one. Hopefully a plain silver one with "NIMA" engraved on it. Haha... I'm such a weirdo. Anyways... next topic.  Nima went to the doc yesterday and he said it was nothing serious. Good. I didn't want anything bad to happen. Still, I'm a little worried 'cos you don't just get nosebleeds for no reason! Hmm, I miss him. Hee heezZ~!   Oh yeah! I remembered something I was gonna ask him. I wanted to know if I could sit with him during dinner at grad or whatever. :P HahazZ~! And also wanted to ask him if he wanted to sit together for the bus ride to Sudbury since Vivo and Mark might be sitting together and I know Safee's sitting with Alice. Iunno. He might not want to though. I know that he might want to sit with his guy friends instead. Iunno. Whatever. His choice. 'Cos if I fall asleep on the bus (high chance) then I'd want to be asleep on HIS shoulder instead... like on the ski trip. HahazZ~!   Eww, my wrist is sticky... it's sticking onto the table, where I'm resting 'em as I type. Funnyness. So yeah...  Oh my gosh, you know what? I had gotten 98% on my website but since I lost my rubric, I get 0% on it instead. Dude, this isn't my day... it just isn't my day.  Another thing on my mind... grad. I can't wait until grad 'cos it'll be a lot of fun but I don't want to graduate yet because high school will mean our friendships drifting apart a little and stuff... *sniff sniffzZ* Sadness... and there are A LOT more pretty girls in high school whom Nima will meet and it's not that I don't trust him, it's that I don't trust the girls. Haha! 'Cos Nima's not a bad guy and he's really sweet and friendly with everyone. He might come across some really really nice and pretty girl whose really friendly and possibly flirty and he might fall for her... like he used to. Iunno. I love him and I don't EVER want to lose him. Seriously. Even if he doesn't flirt which he promised to not do, the girls might flirt with him. I don't like high school. :( *sighzZ* I can't do anything... but pray.    If my alien is reading this, I want him to know that I love him...

      Earned $10 from hacking. Yay~ And then $5 from the minor hacking done before and I have $15 in total~ Yayness! Got $20 but didn't have $5 change so I just owed the "person" $5. Blah, whatever.   Guitar class was a lot of fun. We did different songs and sounded great! My mom's considering getting me an electric guitar & amplifier in the summer. We're gonna do a garage sale and then I'll get most of the money from what we sell since I'm PROBABLY gonna organize it... maybe. We're probably combining with Rachel too so yeah. Well, it's not that I'm gonna get most of the money from what my family makes but it's probably gonna go towards paying for my guitar. Hopefully. Gotta be a good girl and show mommy that I deserve an electric guitar and amplifier. Hee hee~ I'm probably gonna save up a little too. I really wannit badly, as you can all see... or read. Haha~! Wow, Nathan and Caleb did REALLY well in guitar class today. They've totally mastered the fingerboard! Awesomeness! I'm on my way though. I didn't practise but did a lot better than last time so yeah. I'm totally getting the hang of the riffs. I understand how to pick/finger the chords instead of just strumming, which in some cases sound better... like "POWER OF YOUR LOVE". Total harmony among us. Yayness.   Anyway... Guess what? I saw this really cool dress on http://www.promgirl.com! It's called "COOL SHOULDER". Almost $300! Expensiveness! But I totally love it! I'm OBSESSED! Too bad I've already got TWO grad dresses, otherwise, I'd totally order it online! Too bad it only comes in white and light blue. I wanted it in black. Plus, it's got matching shoes that you can buy additionally. Too bad, I can't get it... maybe I'll get it when it's time for my grade 12 prom! Haha~! But it'll probably be ancient and out by then. *sighzZ* Whatever.  Shopping on Saturday. I'm sure I've mentioned that in my blog previously. I really hope Nima can come. I want a guy's perspective on the stuff I try on. I mean, girlfriends are great to shop with but if they can tell that you really like that outfit even though it looks horrible on you, they'd say: "Oh wow! It looks great!" just so they won't hurt your feelings. But I want a GUY'S perspective on things. Plus, I don't want ANY guy's perspective, I want NIMA's perspective. If I wanted ANY guy's perspective, I would've brought ANY guy with me! But I don't think I dress nicely for guys, I dress nicely for Nima. 'Cos I want to look good for HIM, not other guys! Capiche? Anyways... so yeah. I really hope he can come. I don't want to have to drag some guy randomly from the food court to give me his opinion on the tops I try on, which will most likely be spaghetti strap tops 'cos that's mainly what I'm shopping for on Saturday. Anyway... I should go now... gotta take another shower before going to bed... I'm all sticky... so hot. >O

      I'm off to guitar class in ten minutes. *sighzZ* I didn't even practise. Screw it. I was in a pretty crappy mood today at school. Blah, whatever. The stuff that I didn't want to get to me, got to me. So blah. Whatever. Volleyball tonight. Fuck, I don't get to go anymore. I miss volleyball.   Nima had a lot of nose bleeds at school today. I hope it's nothing serious. I'm just really worried about him. My mom says it might be from being too tired, eating too much junk food, or sleeping too late or whatever. *sighzZ*   I had to go to Maxine yesterday to try on the grad dress I ordered and they had to make variations to my dress 'cos it wasn't a "perfect fit". The shoes I wanted were $125! Holy fuck, dude! I'm only wearing them for that one night though! I can't wear it to school...! There isn't anybody in my family that is getting married anytime soon so yeah... Girls have to spend SO MUCH on grad and guys just spend a little. I spent at least $400 on my dresses. I bought the first one (baby blue) for $170 something but didn't like it so bought a new one (beige) for $200 something. With the old one, I bought earrings and a necklace for it too and those were at least $40 in total. Now, I'll have to get shoes which will probably cost around $100 and I'll need to get a new set of earrings, a necklace, and possibly a bracelet to go with my new beige dress. I'll also need to spend at least $100 on setting my hair, make up I can handle myself, but I need a pedicure and manicure too! So basically, it'd be at least $600 for grad!   Oh my gosh... I'm also going to Markville this Saturday to go shop for a nice top for my Sudbury semi-formal dance! I have a skirt but I need a top! I'm also looking for some nice spaghetti strap tops too! Phew~! A lot of money spent this year! $200 for my green guitar, $100 for the bag, at least $600 for grad, and I don't know how much for Saturday! Crazyness!  Had some ice-cream today after school and also an ice-cream sandwich. Yum... talking to Candace on MSN right now. Hmm, I should probably get going for guitar class. *groans*   Whatever. I just hope Nima's okay. I wonder if he really went to see the doc. I hope he did... some beating from Octi could really put a guy in the hospital if it was serious.   Time to get my ass across the street for guitar lessons. So fuckin hot outside... phew... Oh well... guess what people?   ONLY 2 MONTHS AND 6 DAYS UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY!    ONLY 3 MONTHS AND 13 DAYS UNTIL NIMA'S BIRTHDAY!

      Just got back from band practise a little while ago. Wow... total coolness. By far the best band practise I've attended. Sure, I've been a lazy ass for most of the band practises, just sitting out but wow... this time is just total coolness. We need to get Julie here though~! Safee too! He can scream, I hear. Nima's mom is really cool. So's Moca's mom. Dude, they're friendly. It's a lot cooler when you mom can speak english you know? Oh well, my mom's cool too in her own special way. :) I love my mommy. Anyways... Yeah. Phew... still worrying over my Sudbury Semi-Formal outfit... don't know what to do for it. *sighzZ* Guys have it easy... a nice shirt with nice pants and shoes with gelled hair and that's it. Girls, we need to find the outfit's that's JUST RIGHT~! Julie and I are going shopping at Markville this coming Saturday. Hopefully. I want Nima to come... I know I know... Guys don't like going shopping but if I try something on, I want to know if Nima likes it. Plus, I'd get to spend time with him... which is something I'd do anything for. If I get to spend time with him or if he's there, I'd go for sure... If capable. Well, I gotta run. Chores chores chores... :D Can't wait till next band practise... maybe we can call an extra band practise at Nima's place this week? :P We can plug the mic into his piano amp or whatever. I could also ask Gordon if we can borrow his electric drumpad. Total coolness. Anyway... Gotta run. Buna seara all! Arrive derci~ (I think that's how you spell it) Anyway... peace out! Love y'all...! Especially you ;)

      At school right now. Computer class. Sandiford's marking people's pages and I'm just here doing my thing. Blogging. As usual. Hmm, blogger looks a lot better after they upgraded it. Bored. To death.   I need ice-cream right now... Erica should know why. Yesterday was only cos I was grouchy all day but today... different story. Screw it. Who cares... Don't feel like doing anything.   Wtf. That's all I have to say about it. Blah.   Moses "sprained" his toe so he couldn't participate in gym class. Weird. How do you "sprain" your toe? Oh well... I hope he's okay though. It was a bit funny in gym class... we were doing laps and I was racing Ioana for fun. All of a sudden, Moca fell. Iunno... she was falling face first and landed on her back. Mad funny. Too bad I didn't video tape that. She really fell head over heels for Poodle Tree. Haha! Anyway... So bored. BrB... blog later. Gonna help Derry.

      Well, got outta the shower just now. Talking to Brucey and Ingimon on MSN. Muahahaha! Ingrid and I have "GUMMY BEAR TRIO" in our MSN nicknames. So yeah... YOu know what? Sally is just so blah! This is what Wilfred said in his blog:   alot ALOT of people asked me if bestfriend and kt was going out... there was so many people asking and sticking their noses up it that it was starting to get annoying... WHAT DO YOU ALL CARE ABOUT? // what u gonna tell me ur her friend? LOL weren't people like bsing about kt and how bad she was and blah blah blah.. // but u all care about her... // o ic.. how ironic... // Smart move using my kai mui to check up on the stuff... lol please don't use her like that...   So I'm just like... wtf?! Okay, first of all SALLY was the one nosing about Katie and Nathan going out. She told Wilfred that she was finding out for a friend or something and INgrid an dI are like: *smacks own forehead* Smart move. We didn't want Sally to go find out for us and now Wilfred thinks we used his "kai mui" whose also known as Sally, to find out for us. What the fuck?! See the cockiness?! What is up with that?! Sally asked him, not us! We don't give a fuck anymore if Nathan and Katie are going out! Yeah, everyone's bitching about Katie because everyone hates her, but Wilfred stands up for her so much. I'm just like WTF?! I don't think they've seen the bad side of her yet. I don't care if they get hurt by her because I honestly think they deserve it for being so close-minded about everything. In my opinion, he's always doing what he "THINKS IS RIGHT" but he never is. I wish he'd just stop this bullshit and ditch Katie. He's blocking out everybody including Sally just for Katie. What the fuck?! Who does he think we are?! Evil backstabbers that use friends for gossip?! Ingrid and I don't give a fuck anymore about Nathan and Katie and he thinks we still do! All Ingrid and I wanted was to be cool with Nathan and Wilfred again and just be good friends. BUT Sally had to be so blunt and bring it up so now we're in "hot water" with them again. (quoted in a way from Ingrid... modified wording) Geez, I'm not telling Sally anything ever again. Untrustworthy. I just wanted to be really good friends with Wilfred again... but things keep happening and I think I'm just gonna give up on trying to grasp onto this chance to become good friends again... I mean, from what I hear he supposedly still has feelings for me and I guess there's no way that I can become close with him again without going out with him again... which isn't going to happen because I love Nima and not him. Despite his cockiness and bitter shell, I know that he's a good guy. After our break up he just toughened up because he felt as if he got struck down... he's trying to put his guard back up so that he won't get hurt again... but sometimes that wall he put up... is too hard to get through to be friends again... I really valued his friendship. It's a shame to lose it. He was a really cool person when I first met him. Peace-crazy guy... funny, cool, friendly, outgoing... after all that, he's just... cold, bitter, hard, uncaring... I don't like it.  Hmm, Nima said he'd call after 5 minutes... *sighzZ* I miss him. Well, whatever... Hmm, POP this Friday for Bethel. I hope we're doing something cool. They're not gonna tell us! NOOO! Haha! At least tell us if we need to bring bible! Oh well! I'm gonna go now. I wonder if Nima's even gonna remember to call back. Oh well... whatever. It's 10:40 or whatever now... it says 10:40 on my computer but 10:30 on my watc. Whatever. Round it of and you've got 10:35. Big difference. Anyway... I'm off... don't know if Nima's gonna actually call back. Hope so... I don't think he will though. Whatever... bye.

      Talking on the phone with Nima. Hee hee~ I missed him so much. Now we're talking about people we trust... Not a lot of people, but strong relationships htere. Relationships as in friendships. Yeah... Hmm, I really wanna run over to Nima's place to help his sister out with her midi stuff but I can't. :( My mommy won't let me... if she isn't done by tomorrow, I'd go over after school and help. 'Cos I can help her get a program that makes it into a midi. Blah... I hope she gets it complete in time.   Nima~ Hee hee~ My favourite guitarist/rocker. My alien. My perfect boyfriend. My everything.

      Well, I went to Sunday Worship today. Saw Lisa but didn't really say anything. Just hi and that was it. Wait, not even a hi... only a smile. Haha! She walked by and Sally or Tiff or whoever hugged her and I just smiled at her. Haha~ I missed her a lot. Blah. Don't wanna bug her too much so blah. Guess who else I saw? Gummy bear#1 & #3~! That's right! Jay and IngiEE~! Muahahaha! Gummy bear trio! We went to English worship as usual and then instead of going to CD Team like usual, Auntie Amy told us to stay and watch Gordon with the drums in Chinese worship. We did and I almost fell asleep in the middle of singing! I DO NOT understand Chinese that well and I can't sing chinese so blah. Sally's skirt ripped near behind her knee so she tied her jean jacket around her waste. Then, she just stayed outside. I wondered what took her so long so I went out for a drink 'cos I was coughing a bit and saw her outside. She told me about her skirt and we went downstairs for a drink. Then, Ingrid and Zoe came out so we all just hung around downstairs. All of a sudden, Erica appeared too so the 5 of us hung out in the basement in one of the rooms after having some Sally Cakes. [Joey Cookie, Tiffany Cracker, Alan Biscuit, Sally Cake, Zoe Tart, and Ingrid Pies] Muahahaha~ Coolness. So yeah... We had a little prayer time together in the room (us 5 girls) and then we gossiped aka "sharing negative opinions about other people" and did our make-up. Haha! Funnyness. While I was waiting for my ride after church, Jay kept poking my cheek and Ingrid's and we just poked him back or something. Haha... Funny dude.  During our talk in the room, all 5 of us thought Wilfred had gotten cold and bitter. He used to be so warm and friendly... My fault? Probably... Iunno... Guys are usually like that after they get dumped... like how Nima was "tasteless" with the whole Sara thing. Blah. So we talked about that for a while and stuff...  After that, I got home and cooked noodles. I missed Nima so I called him and we talked while I cooked. Eww... I might've gotten some oil on my white blouse. Then he had to go because his guitar teacher was there. I ate my noodles, talked to auntie and daddy on the phone, and then went upstairs on the computer. Nima came online after I got off Friendster and we just talked a bit. Not much though. Hmm, come to think of it, he hasn't blogged like he said he would. I'll mention this to him after I'm done.   I missed Nima a lot yesterday... and today too. I wanna see him but can't. :(   Hmm, "MISS YOU" on Winamp... I like "ONE CALL AWAY" though... Blah. Slow mushy "I-MISS-YOU" songs. Haha... I wanna go to Screemers this Halloween with a bunch of my girl friends and hopefully Nima. Girls night out... but I'd want Nima there 'cos I'd miss him too much. Probably go out for breakfast together, go shopping, then Screemers. http://www.screemers.ca/ So yeah. Totally cool.   Nima... I love you.

      I'm on Friendster and also talking to Bruce and Candace. Yeah BRUCE! The dude I used to know from Mandarin School! I knooowww~ We lost contact after a while. I had his phone number and I still have it but yeah... Never called him though. Guess how I found Bruce again? FRIENDSTER! I knowww~ Coincidential! I browsed through DesmonD's friends and found... BRUCE! I saw his name and wondered if it was the Bruce I used to know and judging by the pics on the profile, it was! So I added him on MSN and we talked a bit. He remembered me! Yay! I'm glad we got back in touch tonight! He's a really good friend and stuff! Ooh got some pics of Gummi from Friendster. Oh there's this really cool one! I don't know how they do it. It's so cool though! Ask me to show you! It's total coolness! Anyway... I gotta go for now... I miss Nima... Called his place but his dad said he wasn't home. Oh well... I hope I'll get to see him tomorrow or I hope he calls 'cos I miss him.

      Ooh~ My sushi's here. Gotta go downstairs for dinner. Guess what I did all day? First I went to Chinese school, then ate McDonald's. Then, I spent the whole day at home talking to Jay on MSN. IngiEE came online for a while and then left. We're officially the "gummy bear trio"~ Haha! IngiEE's gummy bear#1, I'm gummy bear#2, and Jay's gummy bear#3~ LmaozZ~! Funnyness. Funny love, gay love, love love~ LMAO!   So bored... Oh, and Godfrey told me that Marcos moved out so they don't live together anymore. Congratulated Godfrey. LmAozZ~! Now I feel kinda bad for being so mean to Marcos. Oh well. Blah... I'm so bored... I'm making stars. =) I'll learn to fold a rose someday. Well, I'm hungry so I'm going downstairs for sushi~ Bye bye!

      *sighzZ* So bored... stuck at home... raining outside... missing Nima. There's no one to talk to on MSN except for Jay. We talked and joked around a bit. He thought that he shouldn't hang out with us "little kids" that much 'cos people might think weird. I talked to him about it and told him that all that matters is what GOD thinks and not what other people think. He was just concerned about losing his friends because they think it's weird that he does this. Blah... I think he's a cool dude. Like, a brother in Christ. I love RHCBC~ My family! ^^ Everybody's so friendly and stuff. I love 'em all~ Brothers and sisters, uncles and aunties. My 2nd mom, Auntie Amy~ Haha~ Oh well. I just hope he'll be okay. It'd be a bummer if he didn't hang out with us anymore because of his friends. Blah... PUSH~ whoever's reading this, pray for Jay~ That GOD will help him through this and stuff.   Went on Friendster a bit and added Zoe, IngiEE, Sara, Katie, Alice, Roger, Martin, Jay, Eliot, and a lot of other people. HahazZ~! Funness!  I miss Nima... Can't stop thinking of him. *sighzZ* Hope he doesn't get sick... *sighzZ* Nima... I love you... and I just worry...

      Hm, the Chinese exam this morning wasn't so bad. I think I passed. I wonder if Nima really went to Wonderland today. It's raining outside... if they're really at Wonderland I hope he's okay... don't want him to catch a cold. Guys always get sick carelessly. Gonna go shopping for some tanktops or tshirts next week. Sunday Worship tomorrow. Ew, what if Marcos comes like he said he might? Scaryness~! Nima said he'd ask his mom if he can come to Sunday Worship but I doubt his mom would let him anyway. So blah. It's okay... I want him to come though, 'cos I wanna see him. I miss him... didn't get to talk to him at Bethel... blah. Girls... like to talk. Weird... so yeah. Talking to Kryss and Jay on MSN. [Kryss = Krystal, Jay = Jason] I wanted to go outside but raining~! Blah... MSN's fine. Haha... Jay goes to Seneca College. Hmm, didn't Doris go there? Blahhh~ Funnyness! We talked about "bubbly cheeks" and IngiEE. He liked IngiEE's cheeks. They were BUBBLY. Haha~~~! So funny. Gotta tell IngiEE. Anyways... Hmm, maybe I'll get to go outside on Sunday after church... Fresh air... still a little tired right now but I'm okay, I guess. Miss Nima... *sighzZ*  I wish I could give Nima a hug right now... I wanna apologize to him for not going over beside him when he played the piano and talking to my friends instead. My fault. Shouldn't have PMSed over that. Blah... I miss him so much... Talked non-stop about him during lunch... haha... I'm so dumb. Couldn't stop thinking about him. I'm making stars too... one for each day we've been together... but I'm making some extras. I thought about making one for each time I think of him but it'd be too much. Not enough jars or whatever... I think about him non-stop... not possible for me to make stars non-stop. My fingers are fucked as they are... Blah. Hopefully I'll get to talk to Lisa... Hopefully. I missed her a lot... *sighzZ* Oh well...

      Now I feel bad a bit. Just a bit. I feel "whatever"-ish and I feel bad at the same time. You know what? Fuck it. Not even gonna bother thinking about it. Chinese exam tomorrow. Haven't studied. Gonna flunk. What's worse? It's "that time of the month" again. Blah. Whatever.   Hmm, I talked to Sam today. Sam as in Samantha, not Sammo or Sammy. Anyway... Sam, Angie, and I talked. Well, Sam and I talked a bit about Moses. Moses is her cousin. Anyway... before I said anything, she just knew he liked me. That's... weird. Blah. Girls always have pretty accurate instincts for a lot of stuff anyway. So yeah... We had our little girl talk and guess what Nima was doing? BASKETBALL-ing. Whatever. Anyway... yeah...   Before that, IngiEE and I were outside talking while I lay down and then I saw Will park his cool car and I ran over and gave him a hug. Missed him. Haven't seen him in AGES! Before we left, I went to give him a hug but he was sweaty too so blah. Haha! Ew. Anyways... Yeah...   I don't feel like doing anything anymore. Fuck it... Blah. Don't know, don't care. Blah. JoJo (Joanna Leung) came to Bethel today. I know a lot of guys think she's hot. Don't know if Nima think so. Even if he does he wouldn't say anything. So whatever. I don't care if he thinks she is though. Whatever. Blah. Don't know don't care. Hmm... I'm starting to like this phrase. So yeah... I'm probably going to do what I usually like doing when I get "whatever"-ish about everything because everything bugs me... SHOPPING. I'll go shopping for a semi-formal outfit for Sudbury or something. Haha... maybe I'll find a nice tanktop... I've been trying to look for a nice spaghetti strap... Blah. I'll see.   So tired... can't sleep... MSN... Blah. 11:30PM already. Missing him. Whatever. A bit hungry. Blah... Talking to Ingrid... my "whatever" buddy. Haha... I can talk to her about anything... we both bitch about wastebucket, we talk... and talk... and talk. :) TY IngiEE~

       Okay, this is BETHEL in detail including my personal thoughts about stuff... (which I usually DO NOT put on Lost Diary but blah... this one is an exception)   So yeah... My friends and I talked in the stairway for a while. (Friends = IngiEE, Zoe, Erica, Candace, Vivo, and Mark) Lisa walked in, everybody said hi, then bye. After a while, we walked into the gym and I saw Nima on the stage. I went to sit beside him and wanted to talk but he was teaching a girl guitar stuff so I just watched. After a while, him and Nathan ran off to play basketball so I'm like: "Okay, whatever". So much for talking to him. Then, Jason came over and sat beside me. We started talking and joking around. He poked my cheek and I poked him back. Then he poked Ingrid's cheek and she just jumped and laughed. It's like... his way of saying hi. Kinda like what Nima used to do to people... poke. Erica pokes too. Haha...! Anyway... so we all talked and then after what seemed like ages, Nima finished playing his dumb basketball and came over. He looked at us and I said hi. He went and played on the piano so I was just like "whatever" inside my head and continued talking with Jason and other people. I wanted to go sit beside Nima and talk but he probably would go back to basketball and I didn't want to feel like an idiot being left alone so I just let him be and he played the piano while we all just talked. I felt bad for staying there, talking with Jason instead of with Nima but then decided not to feel bad since he was the one who just ran off for basketball anyway. Now I just plain miss him because he hasn't even really talked to me at Bethel so all night I'm just like: "whatever" to myself when he doesn't talk to me and goes off doing his own thing. When we go out to play hockey, do you really think I go to play hockey?! I only go to see him! So now, instead of thinking "whatever", I'm thinking "wtf". But you know what? Screw it.

      Just got back from Bethel a little while ago. Today at Wonderland was fun. It was great having Nima there and stuff. Long line-ups... good lunch... a nice walk back to Wonderland... Nima was really nice and gave me his jacket when I was cold. Tried 3 times, but we still couldn't win the cute stuffed doberman I wanted. Blah! It was totally cute though. Oh well. So anyways... it was okay. I got a huge headache from being carsick and also ride sick. The wind blowing against me and my head going against the restraints really gave me a big headache. At Bethel, I didn't feel like doing anything. Spent some time in the stairway with Vivo, Erica, Zoe, IngiEE, Candace, and Mark and we just talked. Nima was inside playing basketball the whole time. Then we went inside and I saw Nima on the stage so I went beside him. We just sat there for a while and he helped some girl with her guitaring. I only sat and watched. Then he went back to play basketball before I got the chance to talk to him. Whatever. Jason came over and sat down beside me and we talked for a while. He's a very pokey person! Haha! He kept poking my cheeks and IngiEE's cheeks. Haha! Funny guy. He has this baby-ish voice and it's really funny. Blah. Then Jason took a pic with me using his cellphone and also with IngiEE. Haha! It was a lot of fun talking to them and messing around. Made my headache go away. Got me a little hyper. ^^   Nima stopped playing basketball and played some piano. I was gonna go and sit beside him to talk but I didn't think he'd want to be disturbed when he played the piano so I just let him be and continued talking with Jason and the others. Haha... he needed gum so I shared my last 3 pieces of Bubblicious with him and some girl. Exchanged MSN addresses. BlahzZ~! I didn't really get to know him until tonight. We talked a little and he's really fun to hang around.   I missed Nima and really wanted to talk to him and just take a nap on his shoulder but he was always busy playing his basketball and piano and crap so I just let him do his thing while I talked to the other people. So tired... Too bad... maybe I'll get to talk to Nima some other time. Whatever...  I'm so tired but I don't want to go to bed. I miss him. I want to talk to him a bit before I go to bed but probably won't get the chance. He'd probably be in bed, playing CounterStrike, on the phone with Alice/Jordan/Erica, or playing with his guitar. Blah. I don't know why... but I always like talking to people. It just... is. I like talking to my friends, with my close friends, my best friends, anybody and everybody. I just wish Nima and I could talk more... I find that talking relieves the tension and awkwardness between people. Whatever. He and I will talk when he wants to talk...  Hmm, saw Aaron today but didn't really talk. Saw Derek and Brian too... Why was Mich, Derek, and Brian all there but not Auntie Amy? Her children are there but not her... Nooo! Haha~ I miss Auntie Amy most out of all of them.   Hmm, almost forgot... Lisa's back. I had a huge headache and wasn't exactly feeling the greatest while talking to my friends in the stairway. All of a sudden, I see someone pull some luggage thing into the place where we were and I saw her. Lisa. At first I thought I was hallucinating from being so dizzy 'cos Lisa was supposed to come back in September or whatever! Oh well... I missed her so much. One of the people I trust most. I tell her everything... Or used to. She was really busy in Texas so yeah. Well she came back early. I hope it's not a bad thing like getting kicked out or whatever. *sighzZ* I doubt I'll get to talk to her a lot anyway... she'll be really busy talking to everyone who also missed her and stuff.   Nima had his arms around me most of the time at Wonderland and I could almost still feel them there. Haha! Iunno. Weird. My mind keeps going back to Nima. See?! No matter who I'm with, where I'm at, or when it is... Nima's on my mind. Can't get him out. Don't want to get him out. Like I said to him today, "I could lose as much money as I want, or lose anything... but I don't want to lose you." I love him... I just hope he realizes just how I feel for him. *sighzZ* Whatever. Too tired.   I guess I'm going to go take a shower now... gotta post this on both SD and LD... Bye~ Goodnight and God bless y'all. Fuck.

       You know what? I've decided to make a special blog entry just about NIMA! So here goes...   Nima... hmm, what can I say? He's a great guy. He's perfect! More than perfect! Indescribable! However, I'll try right now to the best of my ability to write a whole blog entry about him!    Let's go back in time...  It all started in the beginning of the school year. I didn't even know him then. I knew there was a guy named Nima, but I didn't exactly know who he was. I knew Katherine liked him last year but that was it. I got to know him better and better, bit by bit. It all started with... music. I guess like many people, we have a passion for music. Especially guitars. He and I were the only guitar-players in this class. Actually, in the whole grade 8, I think only Mark, Nima, Gordon, and I play guitar. I think. As far as I know, that is. So basically, no guitar players in 8Oberoi. Nima and I were the only ones who played the guitar in 8Rodway, while Gordon and Mark were in 8Sandiford. Anyways... I guess that's what got me to see him there and notice that we had something in common. We talked a lot about creating bands and guitars. Eventually, I looked at him as a pretty good friend that I could talk to. I started having relationship problems with Wilfred and I turned to Nima for help. He was the only close guy friend I had then. I didn't want to talk to my girl friends about it, for some reason, and that's kind of where it began. It was November and my feelings for Wilfred had slowly faded away, little by little. Later, I realized that I had developed feelings for Nima. Of course! Who wouldn't? ;)   I started blogging because of all this stuff in my head, practically causing it to explode. He read my blog and realized what the whole thing was about. He admitted he had small feelings for me but also Sara. Hmm, I think I've forgotten that part. Sara. He liked her a lot and he ended up with a broken heart. I felt really bad for him and when I realized I had feelings for him, I wasn't sure if they were "FEELINGS" or pity. That was what made me confused.  In December, I broke up with Wilfred after volleyball (before I left). His eyes got red, as well as his face. Seemed like he was going to break down and cry. I had to leave and gave him a quick hug and an apology. I felt really bad. Then, we got back together after a few weeks. Do you know why? Because I made the stupid mistake of mstakening the pity I felt for Wilfred for FEELINGS. See what a goofball I am?   Eventually, I realized my mistake (a lot of realization in this story) and broke up with Wilfred on February 12, 2004. I sent him an email and he got it. That was the third and last time I broke up with Wilfred. For good. He was really heartbroken. Sent me an email to ask for another chance. I said "Sorry no" and that was it. It hurt a lot to watch the guy I had fallen for go around after Sara, Shar, and Katie. But you know what? Fuck it... it was worth it. :) He clearified the whole Shar thing to me later and he asked Katie to the Valentine's Dance. It was cute. I tried my best and did all I could as a good friend to just be happy for him and stuff.   On February 14, 2004... I was on MSN talking to Jordan and Nima. Nima had to go and went offline. Therefore, I was left with only Jordan to talk to. Jordan had to go to and went offline as well. I figured they went to some arcade or the mall together or wherever so I just talked to some other people on MSN. A few minutes after that, the doorbell rang. It startled me and I went downstairs to see who it was. Nima and Jordan. I was thinking: "What are these two doing here? Damn! I'm still in my PJs! Argh!" and opened the door for them. My mom, dad, and sister were out somewhere for the whole day so I let them in. Only my grandpa was upstairs and he was listening to his radio so whatever. Jordan did his thing and just made himself comfortable in my place. Nima was polite and stuff and we just... talked. Offered Jordan some sourkeys and Nima messed around with ChooChoo. (ChooChoo = my chinchilla) I knew they couldn't stay that long 'cos my parents would be back soon so I asked why they were here and told them that my parents would be back soon so they might have to leave. Nima said that the real reason they came was to give me something and he handed me a box. Inside was a bracelet. I didn't really see anything on it since I just glanced at it... I didn't know how to react and so I gave Nima a hug and thanked him. They left and we embraced once again at the door. [UenTung unni saw us hug at the door since she was on her computer in her room, which faced the door to my house] Later, I was on the computer after they left and I examined the bracelet more closely. Tears came to my eyes when I saw what was on the bracelet. "I LOVE U".   After a few weeks, I heard that Katie told Nima that she liked him. At first, I thought that the two of them would probably end up together or Katie would do what she did to Derry. I was just worried for Nima because I didn't want him to get hurt. However, that didn't happen.  On March 3, 2004 after school, Nima asked me out. His friends were trying to make him do it. I had to go so I jumped into the car and left. After that, he called me and asked me on the phone. Of course, I said: "Sure" and that was how it happened.  He left to Iran on March 5, 2004 and he was gone for 3 weeks. Throughout those 3 weeks, I missed him terribly. Of course, he came back and now it's been 2 months since we've been together.    Nima...  Like I said, he's a great guy. He's sweet, cute, smart, funny, understanding, fun to be with, outgoing, and just... perfect! One of a kind. I love him. He's the best guitarist in the world, my favourite rocker, my alien, and my cereal-lover. Haha~ Nima, if you're reading this, thank you so much for putting up with me. I love everything about him and I'm serious when I say he's perfect. Now, Candace might say that ROGER is perfect but you know what? That's cool too. Nima is perfect in my eyes and nobody could ever replace him. I loved him then, I love him still. I love him now, and always will. I couldn't possibly ask for more in a guy. He's perfect. Nima, I love you and don't YOU ever forget that either.   Conclusion  Well, this concludes my blog entry about Nima and our history. Wasn't it fun reading me go on and on about him? Haha! Anyways, gonna go have my Sheperd's Pie now! God bless y'all!

      Woke up at 9:15AM today... couldn't get back to sleep. Blah, screw it. Who cares? Hmm, I'm hungry. Maybe I'll grab a bite later. I hate it when I wake up and can't get back to bed. Annoyingness~ Well at least I'm going to Wonderland later with Nima, Mark, and Vivo~ Yayness! ^^ We gotta wait for Vanessa at the entrance though, 'cos she's renewing her Wonderland Season Pass too. Blahness.   Aww, Vivo doesn't wanna go on the "scary rides". Blah, I'll either wait down there with her or go up with them. Blah. I'm sure Mark will either stay with her or go on the ride with her! ;) She won't be as scared with Mark beside her. Besides, you don't really get the nerve to go on the big rides until someone forces you like how Jae and BK forced me onto the ride. You don't really learn to appreciate them until you understand how fun and exciting it really is. ^^  Hee hee~ I'm so happy my mom thinks Nima's a good guy. She thinks that out of my ex's, Nima's probably one of the best ones. Iunno... he's tied with Wilfred. Haha... Too bad my mom doesn't know about "where" Wilfred has gone, otherwise he'd be at the wayyy bottom of her list and she'd get my dad to beat the crap outta him! Haha! So I guess this makes Nima #1... as he always was. ;) My mom didn't like Joel. She thought he was weird looking and too nice. Haha! Funnyness! >O  You know, Erica's actually good with Nima. She hated Wilfred, wasn't too cool with Joel, and hated my other ex's. Nima is the first guy she actually approved of. Haha! I don't think any guy is good enough for Erica. She likes Sam a lot though... Eric, I didn't like much. Joe, let's not even talk about him *shudderzZ*. Ali, flirtyness... but overall a good guy. Sam, he was okay at first but now I disapprove of him... what a butthole.   Haha! So basically, I think Ali's best for Erica. She loves Sam so much but I don't think he realizes what he's doing to her. He's so clueless and evil! Argh! I'd slap him if Erica let me near him. She'd know what I was doing it probably tackle me over before my hand even goes within a metre of his face. He's gonna get it from me one day. >:( He and I need to talk.  Ahhh! I wanna talk to Elbert! I seriously hope he'll visit from USA this summer! It was so much fun last last year! Sleepover at Delia's place, video games, waking him up in the middle of the night, going out to the beach to do fireworks, and ice-cream. Then we went to "yum cha" (dim sum) in the morning. Too bad I only got to see him for those few days. Blah, at least he called me before he left... *sighzZ* Good times. He was pretty sweet of a guy, writing a poem and crap, but he's NOT someone I'd consider... Just a good pal! ^^ I heard something about getting together with Cindy, breaking up with her, going for her sister, then I don't know what happened. Well whatever. Hope he's happy, 'cos I know I am with Nima~! Couldn't wish for someone better! ^^ I love Nima and he's the best guy ever! He's   perfect!    I wonder if Nima's awake yet. It's 10:18AM... Only 1 hour until we go to Wonderland. LmAozZ~! I'm so messed. Hey, Vivo finally blogged last night about Wonderland! Yayness!  Aww, Erica's having it pretty rough right now... I'll talk to her tonight at Bethel. I don't like seeing my best friend like this... I'd practically strangle Sam for doing this but Erica wouldn't let me touch a single hair on him! -O-" I guess Sam can't get any worse than Marcos... They're both... flirty... except Sam knows how to flirt and Marcos sucks at it. Only difference... and except that maybe Sam looks better than Marcos 'cos Marcos is scary-looking and Sam is like... innocent-looking, although he's not innocent.   Do you know who looks best though? Nima! Hee hee~ Hmm, I haven't updated my story lately... Blah... I'm just giving up on it. I'm not as good a writer as Rachel is at stories! Moca excels at song-writing and poems too! Haha! Coolness, eh? Oooh... "eh"! Haha! I AM CANADIAN! Roofles! Aha! Saying roofles reminds me of Chrissy. He hung up on Nima and I yesterday 'cos we were too "boring" for him. Weirdo. Haha! Chrissy's always bored. -O-" Weirdo.

      I'm on the phone... AGAIN! Muahahahahaha! This time, with Nima. We 3-wayed with Marcos for a bit and I couldn't stand it and we hung up on Marcos and just talked ourselves. Wonderland tomorrow! Yayness! ^^ Can't wait! Bethel! YayzZ~! I miss Will a little... (don't worry Nima, he's just a really good friend of mine~ besides, he's too old for me haha!!!) We have our little talks once in a while. The man in the white cap! ^^ Anyways... Yeah... I miss Nima.  Ohh you know what? My mom likes Nima... as in approves of him! Yayness! HahazZ~ She's actually okay with us going places and stuff... Usually she doesn't like me hugging people (guys, not girls) but she seems to have accepted the fact that I grew up in Canada and that I'm not a Chinesey person where guys and girls hugging isn't "good" at our age. It's supposedly disgraceful. -__-" Riiight. Anyways... she's okay with it so yay! ^^ I'm glad my mom's okay with it! But my dad isn't. -__-" Gayness.  *sighzZ* Blahness... I miss Nima. :( I wish I could give him a hug before I go to bed or whenever. I wanna see him. I miss him like hell! Ahhh! I'm gonna diiieee! Haha! At least I'll see him tomorrow! I'll wake up, get dressed, put on my usual eye make-up (can't go places without the basic stuff) and then microwave some sheperd's pie from Shneiders... then we'll go pick 'em up! Yayness! ^^   Hopefully, we'll be there by 12? Picking them up at 11:30pm. Hmm, I usually wake up around 11-ish! Muahahahaz~ Lazyness! *yawnzZ* A little tired... blah... I'll go to bed later... not now...

      I'm on the phone... again! Haha~! This time, it's a 3-way call~ Haha! I called Nima and then I added Chrissy into the convo. His name is actually Chris but Ingrid calls him Chrissy... blah! LoLzZ~! HahazZ~! They had their "guy talk" so I put down the phone for a while. Chrissy was asking him something like how far we've gone or whatever...? Haha! Weirdo Chris. Well I'm happy for him! He got dumped but at least he's with Becca now~   It's partly cloudy tomorrow so blah! At least it's not rainy~ Hee hee! Invited Candace and Roger, but Candace couldn't come so I didn't bother asking Roger. Alice didn't give an answer as to whether her and Safee are coming. -O-" Blahness!   Mark and Vivo are at Nima's place right now. Blah... watching a movie or whatever? Blah! I'm bored outta my mind! -O-" Chinese EXAM on Saturday! Dammnn~ Nooo! Fuck... ahh!  So bored... Don't feel like blogging... maybe blog later.

      Still studying for the history test on Confederation... and still on the phone with my hubby~ Hee heezZ~! Hmm, asian girls tend to say that a lot... "hubby". Blah.    I am complete now that I've found you...   That's from a song I know. [I knew I loved you - Savage Garden] I need a hug right now... dunno why. Blah... oh well. Oh my gosh... I forgot to mention! The other day, a guy gave my sister a flower! It was soo cute! He likes her so yeah. Cuteness~ I was like: "Oh my gosh! That's sooo freakin cute!" They're not together, but he has a crush on her and yeah... people... whoever's reading this, please do not say anything about it to anyone! You're not supposed to know. This is just in my blog 'cos I felt like putting it in here.   Nima. Perfect guy. Perfect guitarist. Perfect. Period. I'd write a poem about him, but I suck at poems so blah. Same with song. I used to write songs about before... like when I was all depressed and crap... but yeah.   Yeah, and all of a sudden, I thought of Pirates of the Carribeans. Hmm, I personally think that Johnny Depp looked better than Orlando Bloom in that movie. *cough*Julie*cough* Haha! Anyways.... but do you know who looks even better than Johnny Depp (whom everybody knows I think is hot)? That's right! NIMA! :) If I got to choose between going somewhere with Johnny Depp or going somewhere with Nima, I'd stick with going with Nima. 'Cos Johnny Depp's only a celebrity. Nima's a celebrity too... my personal celebrity. He's got his own little place right here. *points at own heart* ^^ Aww, don't you feel spesho? ;)   Do you know who I miss a lot, besides Nima? FELIS! I miss her so much! I wanna meet up with her! I bet she's sooo much taller than me! I'm short. Blah~ She's pretty too! Blah... and she's got better grades... blaahh! Heee hee~ Fav word: BLAH!  Wow... there I go with another blog. I seriously have NO LIFE! Oooh, I'm a NO LIFE-er. Ooh, you know what? I've already thought about what rides to go on... Let's see...  Dragon Fire Canadian Minebuster Psyclone Sledge Hammer Vortex Sky Rider Wild Beast The Fly The Bat Nightmares Jetscream  That's all I remember for now. Oh wait, and also the new Tomb Raider ride! Total coolness! ^^ But it doesn't matter what we go on... as long as I'm with Nima, it's all good! ^^ That's most important! Hee hee~ I wonder if the weather will be okay. Blah~ Gotta pray for it! ^^ I'm thinking about what to wear for Friday! Haha! Hmm it's pretty warm on Friday. Probably will wear my And One hoodie. I don't want to wear a jacket... too annoying. T-Shirt won't be warm enough anyway. Haha~   I love you ;)

      Still on the phone with the best rocker/guitarist ever. He blogged and yeah... HahazZ~! Both studying for history test. >O  Like I said, I can't wait until Friday~ I can't wait until tomorrow when I get to see him again! Yayness! Hee hee~   I can honestly say I love everything about him! I don't know what in particular, but he's just... iunno~ Indescribable. The best things in this world are indescribable. Ever heard that? Like... sunsets... the Grand Canyon... you can never fully describe it... the best way is to experience it. The best thing that's ever happened to me is my alien~ I can't describe just what I love about Nima, but I know I do. [don't you forget either]   Ahh~ Freaking out 'cos of History Test~ Ooh, I wanna get on Dragon Fire when we get to Wonderland! It's right by the door and crap... ^^ Hee heezZ~!   Hmm... bringing back memories about last year. I went to Wonderland with Brian Kim, Jae, and Rachel last year. It was a lot of fun. Jae and BK had to pick me up and put me onto the rollercoaster 'cos I was so chicken! I'm glad they did though. 'Cos now, I'm not scared of 'em! Hee heezZ~! Yayness! We spent an awful lot of time in the arcade 'cos of Jae and BK last year. -__-" Haha! That's where Rach and I got out blue sticky spikey things too! They're a lot of fun. I have a mark on my wall 'cos of it. -__-" Blahness~  I should be careful at Wonderland... the U on my bracelet is coming off a bit so yeah... always getting caught on stuff. Blahhh~ The important thing is that I've got Nima~ "If I've got everything but not you, then it all means nothing to me." Trueness~   I love you.

      I'm on the phone with Nima right now and yeah... he's a really sweet guy and he's perfect! More than perfect... indescribable! :) I'm lucky to be with him~  *sighzZ* History test tomorrow! Argh! So blah~ I don't understand what the "American Problem" but yeah... Whew! >O  Hee hee~ I can't concentrate on studying~ Can't stop thinking of Nima. Yay! He can come to Bethel AND Wonderland on Friday~ ^^ Yayness! I can't wait! I miss him. :( I used to miss him even when he was beside me, but now I don't. Dunno why. But I miss him when he's not there with me or wherever... or when he's not beside me. Hee hee~  Niiimmaaaa~ A nice name! ^^ Gonna get ice-cream or blue slushie when I get to Wonderland! Yay~~~~

      I was on the phone with Nima and then I had to go to guitar class. Haha! I didn't even notice the time 'cos I was talking to him. ^^ I always love talking to him. When I can't see him, I'll have the next best thing... TALK TO HIM! Hee hee~ So yeah... I was late for guitar class but it was okay. We did some different riffs and stuff with different chords and crap.  I came back and saw an email from Candace. Read it. It was one of the blah-est emails I've ever received. By blah, I don't mean it in a bad way. I guess it's a good thing that she read that in my blog. She says she's gonna change and I have faith in her. She said sorry and stuff but I guess I'm the one to say sorry and also THANK YOU. I really should've been honest with her about how I felt about things and when I wanted to tell her, I just chickened out so my bad~ The THANK YOU is for getting me to realize that it would've been a lot better if I just did what I should've done in the first place. I guess P.U.S.H. is even true-er than I thought.  Never underestimate GOD!  The lesson of the day~  Yeah, and I guess it was my bad after school... I got Jeremy to go buy ice-cream for me (a small twist cone... yummy!). Blah... Nima wanted to go but I didn't want him to, so yeah... I only got Jeremy to go because I was too lazy to get up from my seat! HAHA! Lazyness~ So yeah... plus, I didn't want Nima to go... I wanted him to stay right there beside me~ ^^   Well, to be honest... I've got something to say. Something that I know a lot of girls do subconciously and probably will NEVER admit. I know one who's admitted it and I admit it too! To be totally honest, I've done some pretty blah stuff that I know that I probably shouldn't have done. Sometimes, it just seems like Nima doesn't know I'm there... like he doesn't see me or whatever. So I start talking to some other guy (not flirting, but TALKING) and I guess that's self-explanatory as to WHY I start talking to some guy. DUH! Attention! I know... it's gay, but you know what? Whoever's reading this (IF YOU'RE A GIRL), I know that you do it too! I KNOW IT! Don't try to deny it! 99% of the population of average girls do that! Blah... It's just... something I know that I do subconciously and then feel bad about. Haha... gayness... Blah~ See what I mean? I'm such a bratty little girl! BRAT & PROUD! ^^" Anywayyyy, Moca's probably going like: "Daaaaa bine" HAHA! So yeah... That's me. My thoughts. My crap. My bullshit. So shut up! Haha~ Joking. Dude, I love blogging. Allows me to type stuff I'd never say out loud! Whoohoo!   Thank you guys for listening~ Wuv y'all~~~

      Talking to Candace on the phone right now. I was on MSN and she just... asked if I was mad at her. I was like: "whaaat...?!" and then we talked on the phone and she mentioned the blog entry on "May 1". So, I immediately checked it out... she quoted:  "I just hope CANDACE doesn't flirt with him. She flirts too much with every guy. Like Erica said, I'd flirt with Roger just to show Candace how it feels, but he's like a brother to me so flirting with your brother just isn't right. Plus, I've got Nima. I don't think Nima will be too comfortable with that. Erica won't flirt with him 'cos he's... a girl! Ewww~ Hee heezZ~! So yeah... If Candace tries to pull anything today, I'm sooo gonna bitch at her! >:( "  I was freaking out sooo much! Phew~ We got past most of the complication stuff and yeah... I'm really glad we talked a bit. *sighzZ* I talked to Roger too, on the phone. Whoaness~ Haha!  Hmm, Vivo wanted to go outside with Mark and Nima and I, but Nima wasn't home. Heard from Mark that he was at Cosmo getting a new amp. Blah... typical. *sighzZ* Candace and I will talk again later or whatever so yeah...  Complicatedness...

      Told Nima about the Nathan thing yesterday at band practise. Today I read his blog in his agenda and he was kinda... upset? I don't know... He wasn't sure if I liked him. But I do... I am SO sure. I love him. I seriously seriously do. Yesterday at band practise, I called Moses and talked to him about everything. About me being uncomfortable with stuff, and yeah... He doesn't tell Moca stuff anymore 'cos he thinks she tells me... What the...?! By the way, remember that the stuff in here STAYS in here~! You take this to your grave! Hee hee~ Anyway... yeah... Moca and Nima did their thing at band practise and I called Roger and talked to him about something. Got frustrated and crap but yeah... Cantonese comes in handy sometimes! :D Hee hee! Anyways... Yeah... Today, there WAS something on my mind and there still is... but everybody's got something on their mind always anyway. So blah. It's nothing serious anyway... I miss Nima... :P Ooh, you know what? He got hurt 'cos Octi hurt them and stuff... :S I hope Nima's okay. His ribs hurt... See?! I hate it when people get violent... I can't just tell him not to fight or do anything violent 'cos it's just what guys do... it's like telling me to stop talking! But.... I just hate to see him hurt... Vivian thinks so too. Who would want to see their boyfriend so hurt and stuff?! *sighzZ* Guys... they're so blah. You can't live with them, but you can't live without them. Screw it... I want to assure Nima that I love him and him only. Sometimes, he's not the one that has to wonder whether I like him or not... it's me! Haha! Blah... but if he's reading this I want him to know that I'd never stop loving him~ XoXo~  Love you... you know who you are.

      Marcos gives me the creeps... I'm shivering... I even have goosebumps! Isn't that scary?! He's mad funny though! Ahahaha! He said he liked me since kindergarten. Okay, is that like... flirting? 'Cos he sucks at it! He asked me out to the movies! -__-" Wtf?! What part of "I have a boyfriend" does he not understand?! Godfrey kept telling him I had a boyfriend and he just kept on going on! -O-" Ingrid's right... oddball! Haha! They're so "mo liu"... walking around Future Shop, KFC, Loblaws, and all that. They have nooo lives! Haha! Now he has my address, AND phone number! Holy crap...! Stalker dude...! Told me to dump my boyfriend 'cos I'm "too young to date". Yeah right! He's only half a year older than me! Calls himself my brother? Yeaaahh okay~! Then he said he had to go and asked when I'd go to bed tonight so I quickly said "around 11pm" and he said he'd call me at 9:30pm. -O-" Spare me! Scary dude... As much as I wanna meet him, I just hope he won't be flirting the whole time... gayness.  He might come to RHCBC tomorrow with Godfrey and stuff to meet me. At first I wanted him to come tomorrow so I can meet him, but now I'm not so sure. Before, he said that he has to go to HIS church to see his girlfriend but then afterwards he said I'm more important so he might come to our church. Butthole. -O-" Feel sorry for his girlfriend. If that was Nima, his ass would be kicked outta the door instantly! Tsk tsk tsk... Scaryness... *points to arm* See? The goosebumps are still there! Ewwyness!

      I just got back from going to Moca's. It was incredible awesome! We had sooo much fun in those 5 and a half hours! Total coolness! We jammed and jammed and jammed! She is soooo funny! Haha~! WAL-MART COMMERCIAL! [inside joke] Hahahaha! Funnyness! *grins stupidly* Haha! Hanging with Moca always makes my troubles go away~ Way cool dudee she is!   Sing the following with a very off-key country accent   This is a sad sad song... About the souls that don't belong...   *LmAozZ~!* Funnyness!  ROOFLES  Mad funny~ Hahahaha! So yeah... Damn, Moca sings great punkish-rockish-opera-ish-thingy-songs! Hee hee~! We turned the creepy latin & toe-E-ah thing into a cool gothy punky rock-ish song! MuahahahazZ~! LoLzZ~! *dies laughing* Had a great time! I'm glad I went to her place. I reckon FMP wouldn't have been as much fun though... although Nima's there so that makes up to it~ Hee heezZ~! I miss Nima!  Marcos Ho just called me... -O-" Weirdness. So we're talking on the phone... Weirdo. He's mad flirting... -___-" Gayness. He's gonna be at Bethel this Friday. I wanna meet him and all, but flirting is just... blah! He's probably gonna mad flirt like he did with Erica. -__-" Gayness. Nima... please come on Friday! Ahhh!!!!! Save me from this weirdo!!!!   So yeah... Yay! He has a second line! Phew! Whoever it is saved me from this weirdo. Blahness... Blog later. Adios~ Ciao~ Boona Syara~ Goodbye~

      Well, here I am in front of the computer once again. Went to Chinese school this morning. Borrring! Tried calling Nima at Jordan's place but got answer machine instead. Oh well. So yeah... They're all going to JQ's bday thing at FMP so I hope they have fun. I trust Nima to not flirt anymore 'cos we talked about it and stuff. I just hope CANDACE doesn't flirt with him. She flirts too much with every guy. Like Erica said, I'd flirt with Roger just to show Candace how it feels, but he's like a brother to me so flirting with your brother just isn't right. Plus, I've got Nima. I don't think Nima will be too comfortable with that. Erica won't flirt with him 'cos he's... a girl! Ewww~ Hee heezZ~! So yeah... If Candace tries to pull anything today, I'm sooo gonna bitch at her! >:(  Ooohh, and I talked to Marcos Ho this morning at Chinese school. I called him for the first time! Haha! Godfrey gave me his number. I asked him what school he went to in kindergarten and he asked me the same question and we kept arguing about who will say it first and stuff... so anyway... it turned out that he was actually the Marcos Ho that I knew from kindergarten. Coolness, eh? Muahahahahaha-ness! I asked him to come to church tomorrow morning but he had to go to his own church so he's going to come to church next Sunday and this coming Friday for Bethel, so I'll be meeting this guy again for the first time in 8 years! Coolness, eh? Haha! It's sooo cool! My mom reckons she knows his mom. Blahness... so yeah...  I gotta finish talking to Moca and this blog and I'm gonna wash my hair and then go to Moca's! ^^"  Miss you, love you~ (you know who you are) My alien~ *mwahzZ* My fav rocker~ Best guitarist in the world~ Best boyfriend~

      Wow... I guess I didn't take a shower when I said I would've. I did my own facial (kind of) and put on TONS of cleansers and crap and yeah... my face feels a lot more refreshed! THEN I took a shower.  Called Nima but he wasn't home. His mom answered and again recognized my voice (or it could always be Caller ID) so yeah. Told me he was at Jordan's so I called his cell. Blah.   I'm so hungry... haven't eaten anything since 12. Had a chocolate bar around 1:30, and a small bag of snack noodles at 6 but that was it... still haven't had dinner. The only thing I had for breakfast was Shepherd's Pie and I had a few Chinese Pork Buns for lunch. I'm so freakin hungry... and tired... and sleepy.   I burnt a piece of paper in my washroom! LOL! 'Cos there's no carpet in the washroom and the floor's tiled (duh) so I wouldn't set the house on fire. Blah.  My fingers are SO FUCKED UP from golfing! Skinned 2 fingers, which now STING from contact with ANYTHING except for air, and got a callus on another. Golfing's worth it though... I guess. I might join the golf team in BSS and meet more golfers and I'll TRY OUT for basketball (although I won't make it since it's more like a popularity contest) and I'll TRY OUT for volleyball. *sighzZ*   Talking to Park on MSN again... Nobody else to talk to! Ahh! So bored. Will came online but he's busy so yeah. I'll see him tomorrow.   Oooh that reminds me... church tomorrow. Hm, I feel like dressing a little more like ME... probably a t-shirt, jeans, and... my cowboy hat? Iunno if it's appropriate for church though... maybe I'll wear it to Bethel next time. Maybe. Dunno. Whatever. Haha! I can't ruin my hair tomorrow though. Wait, I gotta wash it with extra stuff to make it extra nice for grad.  Ahhh! Thinking about all that work is making me HUNGRY! Screw it whatever. Hehe! I'm off for now...

      Got back from golfing just now. Haha! Yeah, golfed from 12pm-5pm! Crazyness! My hands are sore and they hurt sooo much! Jae and I took a walk to a nearby convenience store and bought a pack of cigarettes and 2 lighters. I had 8 bucks left on me and he had 3 bucks. The pack of cigarettes was 8 bucks approx and the lighters were approx 3 bucks. So it all worked out. I payed for his cigarettes and gave him one of my lighters to smoke with. I kept one of the lighters. It's black. Hehe~! Fav colour. Anyway... yeah. His parents came afterwards and golfed with us. The two of us were really tired so we went and read comics instead. Before that, we also went outside to a nearby park and started a small fire in the middle of a clump of trees... so basically we were out of sight. The fire got A LOT bigger... like a campfire and there was a lot of wind and we didn't want people to see the smoke so we stopped it and then ran back. It was a lot of fun! Hehe~!  Then we went to Galleria supermarket and walked around while his parents shopped. I got myself some noodles with the 80 cents I had left. Haha!   I wanna call Nima but Julie's on the phone so screw it. Taking a shower in a few minutes maybe.

      It's 10:05am as I type. I'm supposed to go to Nima's place today at 10am but then I just thought I should wait until 10:15am to call and make sure. Blah. So I just came upstairs and blogged. Yesterday was soooo much fun! Haha! I was like... hyper. But that wasn't even considered "hyper" hyper. That was just moderate. If I get REALLY hyper... haha! It'd be scary. ^^"  Wow... grad's only 2 days away! The day after tomorrow! So scary! :S MONDAY~! I think Erica had an extra ticket for Auntie Amy, I don't know. That's what Auntie Amy said. I'd have invited Ames (Amy Wong) to come to our grad but I think she might be busy with school and other stuff so yeah. Busy busy girl.   Ahaha! Okay so yeah... recap on yesterday and the stuff I forgot to type up about. So... [person1] was majorly macking on [person2] and it was sooo obvious but then [person3] started macking on [person2] also! That surprised me... that [person3] would mack too. Interesting. Not like [person3] to mack. Oh well, whatever.  Erica and Karen were talking outside the kitchen while we were all being hyper outside and yeah. It was fun though. When my mom came to pick me up, Sally came out with a huge container full of water to splash at me 'cos I dumped a cup of water on her so that she'll get an excuse to use the little container of water that she was holding "just in case" somebody gets her wet. I knew she wanted to join in the fun 'cos not too many people were getting her wet so then when I was approaching my car, she splashed the whole thing at me anyway, getting my jeans wet and also a bit of my car. Tiff ran over and whispered to her that she shouldn't do that in front of my mommy (smart thinking, Tiff! too bad Sally doesn't think that!) but I said it was okay anyway. Doesn't matter. I'd go home and change anyway. Hehe! Drove Sonia home while Martin and Gordon stayed behind. Blehhh so much fun! Hehe!   Can't wait until next Bethel. Probably won't be another water fight but it'll BIG BIG WORSHIP on July 2 so yay! June 25 there won't be fellowship (ie Bethel, SALT, etc) because they have councellors and leaders training for the camp. Nima's supposed to come on July 2 for the BIG BIG WORSHIP but I don't know... It might not be for sure that he's coming so whatever. I think I'll probably have more fun there at the worship than he will 'cos it's not just about music. I love BIG BIG WORSHIPs 'cos I actually mean all those things and I sing it with a passion for the LORD. Nima... he's not exactly Christian and he wouldn't sing there anyway although nobody can hear anybody since it's so loud. Blah... there'll probably be a message to and scripture reading and the usual so yeah. Meh, whatever. I've gotten used to Nima not being able to go to Bethel anyway even if it's not for Christianity which is okay. So blah. Like I said, I balanced out my life and I guess the times when I go to church is DEFINITELY a time where I get to enjoy praising the LORD and serving Him alongside my brothers and sisters in Christ.   Might to golfing with Jae after coming back from Nima's instead of having lunch and then going outside with him... Gotta ask mom... gonna go now. BLog later.

      Bethel today was interesting. BBQ and games. BBQ was good. Had a bun (didn't want patty), and tons of "Chuen Sew". We played dodgeball with the doctor stuff on the team and yeah. It was cool. Got hyper the whole night. Sonia and I layed down on the stage and just talked. Finally remembered Karen Lau's name. Haha! She was "POP CAN GIRL" 'cos she had the pop can stuff on her earrings. Very cool person. I think she's a really good friend of Amy's. They're always together. Obvious. Anyway... Had a really good water fight after that. Got myself all wet 'cos of SALLY mostly, got my tank top a little wet, not too wet that there was any exposure and I guess that was it. I'm considered lucky. Other people got a lot more wet! Like Gordon and Wilfred! Muahahahaha! Got Gordon all wet and Wil too! Actually I put my 3 cups of water down Gordon's back and then some in Wil's face! ROOFLES! Hilarious.  School today was okay. (why do I always go backwards on my day?) Might go to Nima's tomorrow. Not 100% sure yet but yeah. I'm really tired. Didn't get too much sleep last night. Probably won't this night either. Whatever. Got a new ring (yay!), a watch, earrings, hair accessories, and a phone string thing. :) It's a couple thing. A girl and a boy one. So I'll keep the girl one and I'm gonna give Nima the guy one. It's a super-casual grad gift. So yeah. I was gonna get us a couple ring instead but I don't think Nima would like a ring. Besides, it's not really a "girlfriend" thing to get the guy a ring anyway. Haha!   Well, I should go now... I might blog tomorrow. I don't know. Whatever. I'll try to get some shut eye tonight. I'm off. Peace.  P.S. Took piccy with sis. It was okay. I guess my sis isn't as bad sometimes when she's in a good mood. ;)

      At Moca's house right now. We messed around for a while. Watched "LOVE ACTUALLY" and stuff. Didn't leak this time. Haha! I stayed over instead of going home for dinner. Called my mom to get permission. She said that Danny (aka Dan Benin), Herman, and Nima called. Herman left a message, I called Danny back but he wasn't home. I called Martin to tell him something and finally I returned Nima's call. Since I was at Moca's to hang out and stuff I didn't think it was a good idea to be talking on the phone with Nima so yeah. It was cool. Studying for History and blogging. Oh joy. Anyway... yeah. Having fun.  Today was a pretty emotional day. I cried myself to sleep last night after praying 'cos I was thanking the LORD for blessing me with great friends. Moca, Julie, and I cried at school so much. Haha... like Moca says "In the end, we're all fruit!" Funny Moca... gonna miss her. :(   *sighzZ* So much to say but I don't feel like blogging so yeah. Well, gonna go back to studying. I'm off. Peace to y'all. Love you guys.

      I'm going to band practise in like 10 minutes. Just taking a while to blog before I go. Nima didn't play basketball for both recess and we just hung out. I'm surprised. Blah. Got an email from him too a while ago while I was checking my email. It's rare of him to send emails but yeah. Glad he did. He went home early cos he was tired and had to work on the speech too. *sighzZ* Grad coming up this coming Monday. So quickly... Too quickly.  We might be meeting up on Saturday again. Iunno... I hope my mom lets me. Bad news. My sister's friend saw us "doing something" at the back hill so yeah... I said "no I wasn't" to my sister and if my mom asks, I'll say we were "nuzzling noses" like we usually do. Haha... anyway, I gotta run. Blog later if I can.

      Talking to Brian Park on MSN. From now on in my blog, I'll call him Park. Yeah. Last names. Too many Brian's I know. So yeah... Park is having problems with his girl again. Well, I'll do what I can but yeah. I was just talking to him about his nickname to make sure he ain't cheating on Alicia. LOL~! I'm such a weirdo.   I think I woke up a little. More awake than asleep. I'm tempted to go back to bed but I'm waiting for Nima's call back after dinner so I'm talking to Park. :P   Daddy called just now. Hehe~ Talking on the phone. So bored.  Well, watched that episode of Newly Weds/Punk'd again and Park just got offline. *sighzZ* I don't know what to doooo... high school. Grr...  It's so friggin hot right now... jeez, I'm wearing a tanktop-ish undershirt-ish thing and its still so freakin hot. Grr... My long jammies pants are NOT helping either. *sighzZ* Goshnameh.   Guitar lessons tomorrow. Ew. I'll have to see Nathan and Caleb and Timothy and Joseph again. Well, I guess Nathan isn't that bad. Talked to him at church on Sunday outside and it was just... blah. I think he's going out with Katie. Cool. Caleb... he seems like a Nathan-wannabe but he's still cool... Joseph's just messed and Timothy's a nice guy. Knew him since grade 5 I think? Whatever. So yeah. Probably doing Rhinestone Cowboy again. It's a cool song though. So yeah...   I've tried speaking less Cantonese with my Chinese bros around Nima. Sorry if I accidently do it sometimes... I'm trying.  Blah... so hot. Gonna lay down and talk on the phone. :P

      I looked outside the window and decided to keep my blinds up. The sight I saw was so depressing yet beautiful. The sky was a dark grey while the thunder sounded. The rain pounded on the rooftop next door and I watched it for a few minutes as it died down. I wanted so badly to run outside in my pajamas that I'm wearing right now and just stand alone, bare-footed, in the rain. I longed for the feeling of the raindrops on my face and soaking me. I hadn't felt that since the last time I was outside with Moses in the rain. It felt so good. I see the dark clouds clearing ever so slowly and the rain has stopped. It looks so depressing outside. Like something out of an Evanescence song.   Speaking of that, I wanted to go to an Evanescence & Three Days Grace concert on July 18 in the Molson Amphitheatre downtown. For Priss, Tiff, and my birthday. Hopefully Nima will get to come. Dunno... he might be in Montreal, Cali, or camping. I hope he could come though cos I know he loves rock. I forgot to ask Will... I want him to come too. I hope he won't be busy. He's a really cool guy. I was feeling kinda down 'cos of looking outside and I took a nap but after talking to him on MSN I felt a lot better. Thanks Will. :)  Thinking of this, I just realized that I took so many things that GOD has given me for granted. Like what I just saw outside... or my friends... and family... So many things. Freedom is one of them. The freedom to feel what I wanted. The freedom to think what I wanted. The freedom to say what I wanted. All these things I took for granted. I took Erica for granted. She's my best friend and she's always been there for me... through thick or thin. I took Nima for granted a little... I've been so sensitive about the littlest things. I took so many of my friends for granted... I realized how much I loved each and every single one of them. But most of all,  I've taken God for granted.  I was so wrong to have done that... He's done so much for me yet I took it all for granted. I've ditched Him too many times for my own selfish reasons. Please pray for me y'all who are reading this. I can't do anything without GOD and I've taken so much of HIS credit... THANK YOU LORD... for making all of us so beautiful... because every piece of work that YOU've done... is beautiful.  The clouds are really clearing up now... I see a litle bit of sunlight and some white clouds instead of grey... do you know this makes me think of? Sin. That 5 minute storm was our sinning and now the light overcoming the darkness from the storm is God's mercy and grace. This is so beautiful. Can't ever forget it.

      I took a looooonggg shower just now. Feeling a little better. Nima's at Kwan's, I think. Whatever. So here I am blogging. Laughed so hard in class with Ioana. She's gotta get into stand up comedy. Haha! Also had a talk with Derry about... stuff. Weird but only to an extent. It was cool though. Funny guy. Not as bad as I thought.   Wrote a letter to Elbert cos Delia's gonna see his ex, Cindy, and she's gonna give it to Cindy to give to Elbert. ^^ I hope he'll write back or email back or whatever. Haven't spoken to him in a while. Blah.  Left my guitar at Nima's gotta pick it up before tomorrow's guitar class. Maybe I'll get it tomorrow after school. Looks like it's gonna rain tomorrow so mom will probably pick us up after school. Or not... I dunno. Doesn't matter. But if she does, then I'll get her to drive me by Monaco to pick it up.   Nima's such a cutie! (uh huh!) Hehe~! So yeah... wrote our little description stuff of our friends for grad and I wrote about Moca. So funny~! Too bad you can't include inside jokes. Meh, whatever.  Well, I'm off... listening to music and taking a nap. Nima said he'd call tonight but iunno... blah. I'm off for now. Peace.

      I've just been outside with Kryss. It was fun... a lot of walking! Hehe! She picked me up at my house and we walked in a whole circle. So smart of us... LOL! We were too busy talking and wasn't paying attention to where we were walking so then we finally made it to HeadWaters after a while and we hung out by the pond a little and I saw on the other side of the railing on the rocks and I heard something in the grass. Before I knew it, I was staring at a snake! It was moving in the grass and I was so scared I freaked out and tried to climb back over as quickly as possible. Then I wanted to see it again so I looked for it and found it in the grass. Haha... it slithered away though. So cool~ ^^ We walked around some more and guess who we saw... Ms. Rodway. Two people were walking towards us in the distance and I was like "Is that Rodway?" cos I recognized the jacket and it was. Her and her husband out for a walk. So weird... she described him as handsome and her husband... well, let's just say he's definitely umm... blah. You know what I mean right? I wouldn't use the word "handsome" but then again... its her husband. Of course she thinks hes handsome. :) I love Nima and I think he's the sexiest guy on earth although other girls may not think so. So blah. So Kryss and I walked to the community centre and bought something to eat, ate outside watching tennis, talked, bought something to drink, ate, talked. Etc~! Found out we lived in the same neighborhood when we were little! Hehe! So cool! We also talked about Nima and high school... *sniff sniffzZ* So scared, still.   Then Krystal came over to my house to see the grad dress and then I went to her house and checked out her grad dress. So pretty! ^^ Silver halter~! Coolness! She's gonna look so pretty and GIRLY! Hehe! Nima called while we were hanging out in the kitchen and we talked on the phone for a while. I missed him so much. I could've ran over to his house just to give him a hug. :(  So yeah... I'm home again. He said he'd call in a while so whenever that is... lol. He also said that for some reason, he missed me the most last night... strangely, that was the same for me... So weird. ^^  We went by a "Father's Day Sale" and I bought a keychain-ish thing that you can tie to your phone for Nima. I have one and I got one for him. Mine is Cancer and Nima is Virgo. Kryss got one too! She's a Gemini! Hehe! Cuteness.

      Just finished dinner. Got a call from Nima. He has guests over so we can't talk on the phone. :( He'll try to get on MSN but I don't think he'll be able to so I guess I won't get to talk to him until Monday.   He's at Demetri's tomorrow for Demetri's birthday and I'm at church and then I'm going home. I'll probably go outside with Moca. Iunno... maybe. Called Jae back and we decided to go golfing next weekend instead, so yeah.   *sighzZ* So bored. Blah, had some Woody's this evening and it was like... yum. Well, I'm off to sweep the floor downstairs and I'll be back within 5 minutes hopefully.   Nima -> I love you.

      I watched 여름향기 with my mommy. It's a Korean movie. In English it means Summer Scent. It's so cute and romantic and all that crap! Song Seung Heon is in it! He's good looking! ^^ But you know who's even better? NIMA! Hehe!  I downloaded tons of wallpaper and the sound track. So romantic and stuff!   Talking to Chris and Alice on MSN.   Oh noo! I missed Jae's call! He called... probably to go golfing! I was out with Nima this morning so yeah. I went over to his place at 10am and we hung out in the basement. Jordan was upstairs playing on the computer. Haha... then we went outside and hung out at HeadWaters. Coolness. Tons of fun. :) Lupper! LOL!  I miss Nima... *sniff sniffzZ* I wish I could see him right now. I don't know where he is... whether he's at home or wherever... I miss him. I probably won't get to see him tomorrow... he's going to Demetri's birthday party and I might go golfing with Jae if he's not busy. *sighzZ* That means I probably won't get to see Nima until Monday.  I thought of Nima non-stop all night... I thought about high school and what would happen. I came up with something but I forgot to tell Nima. So I guess I'll tell him later if I get the chance. I just hope I won't forget. :)   은헤야... 나이상해... 이싱하게 기슴 이두근거렸어... 나... 이럼 안되는 거저...? 너한데 미한 거지...?  That was a quote from the movie. ^^ So yeah...   I gotta go for a sec... Nima if you're reading this, I LOVE YOU. :)

      Bethel tonight. I'm excited. I hope Erica comes 'cos I wanna talk to her. Same with Ingrid.   Oh my gosh... you know what? I miss Nima a lot. I'm gonna flat out DIE in high school! I can't emphasize on how much I love this guy. When I look into his eyes, they seem to captivate me and I just totally freeze. I get lost in his stare... His smile is so warm that it can warm me up during a cold winter day; and his voice... His voice is so comforting and assuring. Whenever I get so stressed out and I hear his voice, everything seems to be okay again even though nothing is. I feel so relaxed and just the mere prescence of him makes my heart skip a beat. :) Gee, I'm good at this stuff! Haha! But yeah... he's really special to me and stuff...   You kno wwho else is important and special to me? My best friend Erica. My buttcake! Always been there for me through break-ups, crushes, stress, homework, hyperness, everything! I love my buttcake~! ^^ Hehe! Through all this crap, we're still great friends and that's what makes this so special! Erica, if you're reading this, thank you so freakin much for always being there for me through all this shit and I really appreciate this! God has blessed me with a best friend that I have taken for granted so much... :) Ty for everything!  Of course, I can't forget Will! He's totally a big bro to me! I talked to him about my problems although it's not often and no, I don't want to create pressure for him, but he's also a great role model for me in my spiritual life with God. It's great and I love him as a spiritual brother. He's always been there to give me guidance when I needed it and I totally appreciate that too! He was there when I was with Wilfred, he was there when I liked Nima, and he's been there when I had my problems with Nima! Will if you're reading this too, THANK YOU! GOD BLESS YOU!  Alice... my sis! ^^ Oh my gosh! She is so cool! Hehe! I didn't know her that well but we've talked and yeah. She's sooo been there for me! I had my talks with her and everything and it's all cool. She's a cool person and everything and I appreciate all that she's done for me too! Thanks sis!!!  Big hugzZ~!  Next is INGIMON! Hahaha! A proud member of the Gummy Bear Trio! Muahahaha! You gotta be cool to be in the Gummy Bear Trio! Ingrid, Jay, and I are all cool people so we're in the Gummy Bear Trio! Ingrid and I have had our share of bitching about stuff and she's always been there for me to bitch about everything that's bugging me and she's done some bitching with me too! We've never bitched about each other though... which is good! We've both bitched about Wil, Nathan, [wastebucket], certain people, and yeah. Ingrid is cool! She's the Queen of the world and you have to give her cookies! Roofles! Of course, I met Chrissy through her and yeah. Thanks IngiEE~!  Oh, yes, I mentioned Jason too! He's a cool dude! Hehe! So cute! I mean that in the baby-cute way! Only Nima's guy-cute! ^^ So yeah... as I was saying... he's part of the Gummy Bear Trio! Cool guy! Hehe! Another big brother-ish person that I look up to! Haha! He's Ingimon's pokemon trainer and loooves pokable cheeks! Hilarious! Hehe! So yeah... thanks for being there Jay! Definitely made a difference in my life!  And then... there's Moca. Yes, Moca. We are the MOFU TOCA! Roofles! Yeah inside joke... anyway... STOP DROP AND ROLL! *cough* Inside joke again. LUPPER TIME! Yeah, another inside thing. Okay anyway... she's a great person once you get to know her. She's not all that snobby. To be honest, I used to think she was a big ego-ed snob when I first didn't know her that well but she's actually really cool. Good but blunt advice. Blunt isn't necessarily a bad thing though. Very straightforward and everything. Moca thanks for putting up with our Lupper sessions! TY~~~! *cough*Garurumon hugs*cough* *shudders at the thought*  There's one more person... CHRIS! Ahahaha! You weirdo! Haha! He's funny... He doesn't have my blog site but oh well. He's been through that girl (don't know her name), Becca, Jess, and now I think he's single again? I don't know... whatever. Only white guy on Friendster... haha! He's hilarious! IngiEE told me about the Shrek movie and I was ROFL! Actually it was Chris that made up ROOFLES! :P Cool guy. He's like a little brother I guess. Iunno not quite sure yet but yeah. Totally cool.  You know who's coolest though? Yeah, I was gonna say Nima but GOD is cool too! God is THE COOLEST! :) He rocks! Yup!  Nima's sexy though. I can't really call God sexy 'cos well, He's my God. But Nima's not my god... he's my alien... my boyfriend. :) I have a different love for Nima than for God. Very different. So yeah... I should go now... dinner and then Bethel... I'm out.   *mwahzZ*

      I just finished taping up some pictures on my door! Hehe! Guess who? :) Nima of course! ^^ I've got like 4 pictures of him on the front of my door along with my celebrity mini-posters and behind the door are the 3 we took together at school. I put them BEHIND my door just in case my uncle came over and saw. Hehe! Now I can face the door every night when I go to bed so I can fall asleep staring at him.   My mom picked me up after school and drove me home along with Nima and his and Mark's instruments. Returned Mark's guitar and amp and then my mom dropped me off at home so that I can print out the good copies of our lyrics and everything and also record the song onto my computer from the tape so that we have a copy of it. While I did that, my mom picked up the photos from Wal-Mart. Then, we drove off to AM1430 Radio Station and I walked in to hand in the registration for the song-writing contest. The person called out Esther who was in charge of this and then she looked through the stuff and led me into a meeting room for the radio station. Told me to take a seat and I did so. She looked through them once more and asked me a few questions. Basically just making sure that I know the rules and what would happen if we DID make it to the Quest.  You know what's really cool? Pinky Luk is one of the "sun sow" people in the Chinese singing-contest thing! Oh my gosh! I heard her on the radio and I'm like: "Oh my gosh! I know her!" One of Wilfred's friends. She introduced herself on the radio and she said she was 16 and attended UHS. I'm so sure it's her! So yeah. I don't know her personally but I know her through Wilfred. I'm not sure but I think she came to Screemers with us? Iunno... blah whatever.   I've still got so much on my mind right now... geez, this sucks... I'm so afraid of high school. Nima and I have NO CLASSES together! So basically I won't get to see him except for at lunch everyday and well, to be honest and totally blunt, I know I won't get to see much of him at lunch anyway. He'll be hanging out with his friends and everything so basically, we'll be so seperated at high school! That sucks crap... Seriously. *sighzZ* Fucked up.  I hope we make the auditions for the contest... pray for us please.  Good news. Moca isn't quitting anymore.

      Been to band practise. Fucked up. Screw it. Whatever. Only one thing was good about the band practise *cough* but that was it... it was the most fucked up band practise ever. I got a long freakin lecture from my mom about the squeezed up schedule that we had... disorganization. Wtf...   I  was  gonna take a group photo of us but nooo! The basement's got laundry! Blah blah blah... whatever. So now my mom's pissed because I didn't take any fuckin group photos and crap and it'll take ages to get it developed... you know what the best part is? The deadline is 5pm. I already got us an extention for writing the staff but thats it. Only the staff is allowed to be late. Nothing else. What the crap... This sucks ass. I thought that we might've had a small chance but you know what? Screw it. I thought this would all work out, but no. I was wrong. I thought we could've done this but no. It's all gone now. My motivation, my enthusiam for this whole music thing? Gone. I had faith in our group that if we tried hard enough, we could get somewhere someday but not anymore. Our designated drummer's resigning from the role of drumming and also resigning from the band after grad. My opinion is that we can do this without anybody but Nima and/or Moca. Seriously. I mean that. But you know what? Whatever. Screw it. I don't care anymore. This is so dumb. I can't stand this anymore. So many comments kept to myself... and they're remain kept to myself... I'll probably share them with Nima and Ingrid but thats it. Nima will know what I'm talking about but not Ingrid... I'll explain to her and I know she'd listen anyway 'cos well... we listen to each other bitch about anything and everything so yeah. God bless Nima and Ingrid.  Things with Erica are cool. I'm so glad we're back to normal. I need her really bad right now. I'll call her later if I get the chance. Really need to talk to her about so much stuff in my head. I could scream. Jeez...  Bethel tomorrow night... so much going on tomorrow I think I might skip Bethel just to stay home that night and punch out walls or something. Or I might go and use that time and tell Ingrid everything... if she shows at Bethel, that is. Otherwise, I'll talk to Auntie Amy about everything. Iunno... whatever.  Ingrid talked to me on MSN just now and I didn't wanna talk. I never do that... I feel bad... but yeah. I'll apologize later.   I really don't need this. I can do without this in my life right now. Honestly. Moca's lecture at recess [dot dot dot], Mom's lecture [wtf...], photos, deadline, recording. Wtf... I hate this. Why did I tell them I found this stupid contest anyway. If I never told them then my hopes wouldn't have been brought up so high that it had to drop now. I wouldn't have all this on my mind. So fuck it. Too late to back down now... Brian and Roger will get annoyed after working on it...   Moca keeps mentioning the $1000 prize money for FIRST PLACE but she thinks we can't go far in this contest so why keep mentioning it? [...]   Look here she comes now Bow down and stare in wonder Oh how we love you No flaws when you're pretending But now I know she Never was and never will be You don't know how you've betrayed me Somehow now you're everybody's fool   Lyrics might've been mixed up but I think y'all get what song it's from so whatever. Anyway... gonna go now.   Just forgot to mention... this started off to be a pretty good day and it ended up like this... I guess I brought this all onto myself?   100th day... Nima got me a rose... very pretty. I loved it. It was cool except for the Jordan incident but my mom's hanging it upside-down to dry it out and I'll get to keep it in my room so yeah... thanks Nima. I love you.

      Just been to band practise. Very interesting. Did our stuff, messed around, basically had fun. Except for the fact that *COUGH* and also Moca and her discouraged spirit. *sighzZ* Screw it...  Nima had lots on his mind and said he'd blog about it tonight but I don't think he'll end up doing it... *sighzZ* Blah...  I had... some stuff going on in my head too and yeah. Don't be surprised if I snap at you outta nowhere... apologizing in advance.  Bethel on Friday! Yay! Media Discussion. This should be good. I always enjoy that.   Last night we went out to dinner and it was cool. Peter had the coolest t-shirt ever. Haha... hilarious. Jason was being dumb (what a freak!) and Cindy and Karen... hasn't changed. :) Still my cool cousins.   Tonight... Very memorable. Why, you may ask? One word. MOCA! *cough* Ahahahaha! I'm a freak! Wee~! Okay yeah. Moca and her eye-roll. Blah.   Tomorrow's the 100th day... :) Wow... thats so... cool? It's... anti-climatic in a way... Special yet... blah? Iunno. Meh, whatever.  It's really hot right now... I'm gonna go take a shower... so much in my head... but so little to type... Blah. It'll all end up somewhere else... but not on any blog. On paper? Possibly. Anyway... I should go.  Acquired a new piccy of Nima. Haha... sexy ;)  Anyway... I'm seriously off now. Peace.  Oooh I forgot... mommy and I went to Cosmo and browsed around some guitars. Sexy guitars, man! :D Obsession with a certain black and gold one. Swweeeetttt~~~!

Oh my gosh... I just realized I might see Harris there. Haha! That kid! Haven't seen him in ages! My aunt's friend's son! He's a freak. Haha... I call everyone a freak. Well, we used to hang out but lost contact so blah.   Listening to "Arms of an Angel" and "I Don't Wanna Know". So... deep. Meaningful. *sighzZ*

      Got home ages ago. So freakin hot. So yeah... working on my Outsiders review. Due tomorrow... ugh!  It was really funny during Science class. Martin L, Martin Y, and Brian. Hilarious people. Makes me laugh so hard. Them and their eraser throwing down people's shirts. Haha... idiocy.   Read Wilfred's blog and Erica's blog at school during Computers. Tomorrow after school... band practise session for the contest. Gotta do this! ^^ So excited.  Oh my gosh! So hot! Argh! Can't... think! LOL!  Re-read the emails that Nima sent to me (almost all of them were forwards) and re-read his blog entries... I read them while listening to "Arms Of An Angel" by Sarah McLachlan. Makes me think... Same with "I Don't Wanna Know" by Mario Winans... *sighzZ*  Nima said he was a little upset today... I wonder about what. He wouldn't tell me though... *sighzZ* Blah... I'm too hot to type right now... blog later... maybe.

      School today was okay. Got a little pissed over something and yeah. Long story, don't ask.   After school, I was packing/talking-ish and Nima came over and gave me a white stuffed bear that was holding a rose-ish thingy. From Wonderland, I know. Haha. Cuteness. :)  Went to try on my grad dress after school, still fucked. Had to go to Korean supermarket with mom and get stuff and got some ice-cream from the ice-cream truck nearby. Also grabbed some guitar stuff from Yamaha Music Gallery. Then went to Nima's place for dance. Talked, hung out, danced. Yup.   Finally got a chance to blog. Gotta go to dinner now. I'm off. Peace.  3 days until 100th day into our relationship. (Thursday)  I love you.

      Wow! Got a chance to blog after all. Finished dinner a little bit ago. The Chinese version of the song-writing contest is on TV right now. Very cool. Good guitar skills.  Talking to Nima on MSN. We were supposed to all work on the dance today at the school park but we ended up goofing off... as usual. Had our hopelessly hilarious moments, our serious moments, our goofing off moments, everything. Ioana and I walked to my house and we stayed outside on my driveway and talked. The usual. About... stuff. Like I said, with Ioana, everything is total honesty. I swear, I think I can talk to Moca all day long and we'd be laughing non-stop. I make a fool of myself for her amusement and she does the same. Hilarious.  Talked to my mom about Nima over dinner and yeah. It was funny. Dad was thinking about coming back to Canada for a week or two just for my grad and I asked what he'd do if he saw Nima and I hug but yeah. He'd probably just say: "Don't you see me standing here?! Hello???" So yeah. He wouldn't have a huge problem with it though.  Hmm, I think we might be going back to HK for the summer (maybe 1 month?) after all. Gotta update our HK ID cards. So yeah. I'll probably buy a really nice blade for cheaper in HK 'cos HK stuff is a lot cheaper than in Canada. Mehe! (no, thats not a typo... I just laugh like that)  Had Sunday worship today and Herman was talking about Singleness: A Whole in One. Very interesting. Made me think. As usual.  Bleh. Got an email from Star Miser. I forgot who that was. Sounds familiar though. Meh, whatever.  Hmm, a lot of stuff made me think today. Voluntary or mandatory? I will never know. Only Moca will know what I'm talking about... but she won't know unless I remind her. Haha. Me and my weirdo codes.   *laughs silently* LAUGHING RETARD  Roofles! So funny! "Are you done yet?" *STOPs laughing, DROPs on the floor, AND ROLLs on cola-covered floor laughing* THE STOP, DROP & ROLL drill! Roofles! That's what Moca did today.  We SO need practise for the contest. 'Cos the people that were in the Chinese one were good. HOWEVER, Moca sings better than all of them. Seriously. They sucked crap when it came to singing. Moca owns.  Nima wants to go to Wonderland again this coming weekend. Sure, why not? Just depends which day so that I know which day I can go golfing. Mehe~! I need a new golf glove (yes, you only play with one glove) 'cos it got too small for me. Same with my golf shoes... come to think of it, I outgrew all my golf stuff... except for my clubs and bag. Damn, I've got a cool bag! Hehe! Costed quite a bit. ^^ It's got a stand, straps for both shoulders, etc etc etc! Muahahaha! My bag owns! :D Whoohoo~  Roofles. I think I scared Nima. I said something jokingly and he didn't reply for a little bit. Okay he just said "lol". Oookay I officially scared him. Haha. Some people appreciate my twisted sense of humor, some don't, and some just live with it. Iunno. Haha. Weird. Only my GM Crew fully appreciate my twisted sense of humor that somehow makes sense! Gotta run.

      I'm on the phone with Marcos right now. Oh my gosh. I was helping my mom with some website and he called. I was just like -O-"~! Jeez, he DOES NOT have a life! He's going after some OTHER girl now! He just said he wanted me to break up with Nima. Gosh, what an idiot! Loser! Capital L!  Went to Wonderland with Jordan, Mark, and Nima. It was fun. Had ice-cream, corn, fries, etc. Nima thinks his mom knows about him having a girlfriend. Not sure what to do about it.  Oh my gosh... now he's boasting about his "Persian". Geez, idiot~! Annoying! Ah! Leave me ALONE!  Probably gonna get together with Ioana, Nima, and Martin to work on drama assignment. Probably will need to practise again on Monday too. But I'll have to go try on my grad dress before I show up on Monday for after school practise for drama.  Wednesday & Thursday! Band practises! MUST! For the contest~! My mom's gonna go drive the cassettes to the radio station after school with me on Friday. FRIDAY'S THE FREAKIN DEADLINE!  Yesss! My mom just came in and said loudly that she needs the phone and I hugged her. THANK YOU MOMMY~! She saved me from Marcos! Phew! She didn't really need the phone but just said it to save me. Hehe~! My mommy knows how annoying he is. Muahahaha~! Suckkerrrrr~!  So yeah... as I was saying. I'm thinking of asking Jae is he wants to go golfing with me this coming weekend at the Eaglequest Golf Dome. Dunno if Nima's okay with it if I go golfing with Jae. I'll have to ask Nima. Maybe he can come along. I haven't practised golfing in a while so going to the driving range would be cool. We could either practise outside in the sun or indoors with air conditioning. Probably indoors 'cos it might rain this coming weekend. In the summer, Jae and I are planning on going on course to play together! Total coolness! ^^ Haven't played on course for a while! I wanna go to golf camp again but yeah... Iunno. Meh, I'll see. I wanna beat him! Muahahaha~!  Got Alice an ELMO from Wonderland. I hope Nima remembers to give it to her. I hope she likes it. LOL! 'Cos I remember she Elmotized her AA page so yeah. Meh, gonna go practise guitar. Blog later... or whenever. I'm off.

      Woke up a bit ago. Nima emailed me and blogged last night. Like I said, pretty unusual but okay. We're going to Wonderland today. Picking them up at 9:30 and we're leaving around 5:30-ish? 'Cos that's the only time I can get us a ride home. Mom's busy after that so yeah. Meh, Nima's leaving at 5 anyway.   To be honest, I don't like Nikki too much. Her and Tara are coming to Wonderland with us. I don't have a problem with Tara but I just don't like Nikki too much. Her PERSIAN PRIDE and loud Persian speaking is really annoying. She was talking about Ioana in Persian so loudly its not even funny. Whatever. I'm probably crabby since I just woke up.  Bethel last night was soo much fun! I picked up Jo and we went to Bethel. Murder Mystery Night. We interviewed different people and basically just had fun! Robbie's group got it right. Haha! Angie was the secretary, Brian was the lawyer, Steve was the brother of Mr. Stone, Amy's friend was Mrs. Stone, and the funny dude was the janitor. Hilarious guy pretending to be janitor. His accent was soo funny! Hehe! So yeah. Next week is Media discussion. I like those~ The one after that is BBQ and Games! Yay~!  Well, I should go wash up and eat. Blog later...? Maybe. I'm off.

      I'm so freakin bored! Didn't have dinner yet but I'm really hungry. After dinner is Bethel. No Chinese school anymore! Yay!  Nathan helped me with uploading BK's song online and stuff. I need Wilfred's help though... 'cos I need to make a computer graphic-ish logo for something. So yeah... I made a little picture that says Graffiti... black and white though. Meh, whatever. I tried.  So bored. Phew... need to type up an email for band. Blah... I'll do that and then game for a while. I'm off.  Brian, we need to talk.

      Oh my gosh! I was just talking to BK on MSN and inviting him to Wonderland tomorrow but he said he had band practise tomorrow so he can't make it and we launched into a conversation about music and our bands. He has 1 drummer, 3 guitars, 1 bass, 1 vocal, and 1 backup singer. He sent me one of the songs they did and I was sitting there like: "WHOA! HOLY CRAP THEY'RE FUCKIN GOOD!" It's so cool! They don't have a name for their band yet but wow! Very cool!  Too bad they don't do English songs 'cos if they did, I'm sure they'll win that contest we're joining. I'm a fan of his band already. All Korean people. Haha! So typical of him. Tsk tsk tsk... LoLzZ~! Oh well, maybe we'll be able to hook up and visit PCW together again sometime this summer. Just like last year. Good times! Hehe!  Wow talking to two Brians at the same time. Brian Park and Brian Kim. Both Koreans. Haha!  Listening to BK's song again and listening to "The Voice Within".  I just said to Brian P that him and Alicia are so cute and he asked if it was a compliment. Haha! Silly kiddo! Of course it is.  Well, I'm off for now.

      Had some ice-cream, dim sum, and water when I came home from school. Watched a few music videos on MUCH and then came upstairs to blog and check my email. Junkmail and one email from Ratemyteachers and one from Bell. Now I'm just here blogging. Safee is an asshole. Long story.  Bethel tonight. Yay~ Murder Mystery Nite. Very cool. Sounds like fun. Probably will be. Nima said he'd come but I don't know if he really is coming. Sounds busy tonight. Whatever. He's not sure if he can call so I doubt he'll be showing at Bethel after all. Blah, whatever.   He said he was considering being a Christian but it's because of the 7 years of chaos and crap. Sounds like pretty much the same reason to me... but... I hope that while he's considering, he'll find a passion for God. Then, I can share my greatest Love with him and we can worship Him together. *sighzZ* Too much hoping. Bleh.  So bored. Bored to DEATH. Cheese. Meh, whatever. Gonna go on Friendster for a while or whatever. So bored. I could die.

      Just had some ice-cream and A LOT of gummy bears downstairs. (Hee hee, IngiEE & Jay) Bethel tomorrow! Yayness! ^^ Oooh, we gotta work on our dance too.  There's something that I find so... blah but you know what? Whatever. Don't wanna talk about it.   I forgot that I had to send the thing to Brian! Haha! Forgot. Bleh, whatever, I'll send him this instead. ^^ By the way Brian, it's all gone! ^^ No more! They go POOF! Hehe~  Still playing with my blunt blunt knife. You know what? I'm gonna attempt writing a  deeper  song for the contest. Iunno... we don't have a lot of time left. Next Friday is the deadline. Let's go, people! More band practises needed!  Well, I'm off to practise. See y'all laters.

      Took a shower just now. Feeling a lot better. ^^ Playing with my knife right now. My mom says its not even harmful enough to cut fruit and I agree! Trying to make it sharper-ish. Damn, I'm addicted to knives! Gonna get that nice little silver hoooked-ish knife when I get enough moolah. :D  Talking to Moca and Martin on MSN. Martin having his Sonia problems so I'm just trying to help him out 'cos Sonia IS my daughter. :) I'm gonna try pulling something... hope it works.   Oh my gosh... something really frightening just happened. The "freakishly ugly grade 7 bisexual girl" just talked to me. She said that my display picture (in black and white) was "damn sexy" and I'm just like :| and then she said "HEHE I LUV U I GOTTA GO EAT DINNER. I MISS U LOTZ". So freakin scary! Ew!  Now I'm talking to Tiff, Moca, and Martin. Still worried about high school, that guy. Well I kinda am too... I've got my reasons. Bleh... *sighzZ* Freakin hard.  He said he'd call me back at 6:30 but whatever. Probably eating dinner or he's still in the shower. Blaahhh. I'm going downstairs for ice-cream. Be back later. :)  Moca, don't fuck him!

      Talked to Nima today and yeah... just about stuff. Blah. I'm a little sus but whatever. I also talked to Erica too. I guess things are cool between us again. ^^ Yayness~! The power of the Internet~   Track and field today. Phew, I think I might have a headache from that wind. Meh, whatever. Talked to Martin, Roger, and Brian. Well, I wanted to talk to Brian and was about to but before I got too far into the conversation, Nima came over so I hung out with Nima instead and Brian and I will talk later. :)  Like Erica says, GUYS ARE SO [BLAH]. Go figure out what blah is yourself. Not giving out answers.  Hm, we really should work on our dance 'cos it's so crappy right now, it's not even funny. So yeah.  Read Erica's email and read Lisa's email. Lisa's coming back sometime in August which is great! ^^ Well, I think I should go for now. Not much to blog about. I'm off. Best of luck to Brian and Alicia.  Peace.

      Had band practise until 10-something tonight! Whoa! Total coolness! Tons of yelling for me! Haha! My voice is weird now. Moca is awesome at echos and Roger is PHENOMENAL at drumming! Oh my gosh! All hail Roger! Phew~! LoL~! Brian left a little earlier but yeah. Talked to him about stuff. Got it all figured out now. ^^  Rog is pretty down about Can but yeah. I'm sure he'll be okay. :)  Got home and signed onto MSN. Left myself on AWAY while I was in the shower. Came back and saw a few messages from Nima. Checked my email. Got an email from him that said some pretty sweet stuff. ;) He told me he blogged (wow... thats rare!) and I read his blog too. Very strange. Not like him to send me an email AND blog! Blah, whatever. Stuff in the blog and yeah... maybe we'll be able to talk about it tomorrow if not, then whatever.   Didn't think I'd have time to blog but my sister is talking to my mom about some Integrity Team so muahahaha! I'm such a bad girl.  Wow, band practise is past coolness! We practised the song I wrote and it was total coolness! The chorus was soo much fun! ^^ I can't talk properly now! Hehe~  Hmm, went back on MSN but Nima's off so I signed out again. Whatever. Going to bed. Peace.

      Track and field tomorrow! Yay! Hmm, Candace just called. Said she needed people to sell refreshments and everything. So I said okay. Blah. Not running the 400 anyway. Selling with Yasi and Nima. Cool. Blah.   Was supposed to walk home with Brian today but I took too long hehe! Neighbors were looking for sister -_-" Grr~ Hehe! Blah. *sighzZ* Stuff going on with itm, itf, and itf#2. But I'm basically on itm's side. Can't use initials and names so blah. Hope everything works out.   I think Roger has changed a lot. For good. To be honest, he used to be a not-as-good kinda guy but since Candace, he's been a lot better. Stopped flirting, being *cough*, and a lot of stuff. They're crazy about each other, which is cute. So yeah. Not a bad guy after all. :)  Alice... *sighzZ* Haven't talked to her much these past few days but I hope she's doing okay. I wonder if she got to get her talk that they were supposed to have...?   Talked to Erica at recess today and yeah. I guess it's all good.  Band practise in half an hour. Nima's not coming. Cancelled out on us again but whatever. We're having it without him this time at Moca's house. He's going to Alex's birthday party.   I don't know if I'll be able to bring my keyboard for Brian but yeah. We need to work on our song for the contest.  Well, there's not much to say now... gotta run. Bye.

      Got an email from WilaX today. I was at guitar lessons and I came back just a little while ago. Got back on the computer, continued typing my story, and went on MSN. On webcam, phone, and MSN with Nima. Haha! He has to go downstairs to dinner but he doesn't want to. Aww... he's such a sweetie but he has to eat! His parents'll get mad. *sighzZ*   Blah... the email from WilaX was sooo freakin long! Hehe! Haven't read a long email since Wilfred's 4 long emails. I think Will's email was longer than Wilfred's emails but then if you count in total, then of course Wilfred's 4 long emails were longest in total! Hehe! Blah...! Wilfred and Will's emails were closest to reality-ish! Other people's advice didn't really come as close to reality as theirs. So if Wilfred and Will are reading this, THANK YOU for giving me GREAT comments and stuff~ ^^ I know what to do now and yeah. Hehe~!  Well, the *cough* problem still remains and I know I can count on Brian to help me out with it! [nooo pressure, Brian!] Haha~!   Blah, I'm gonna blog later... maybe.

      Hm, I read Erica's blog and yeah. Re-read her blog entry that talked about my "over-obsession" with Nima (exaggeration). I've got a comment on that but you know what? Never mind. Don't wanna stir anything. So whatever. All I gotta say is:  think what you want ...   Talking to Moca on the phone. Haha! Woke her up from sleeping on the couch. She fell asleep watching TV! :D Tofu to the rescue! ...or not! Hehe ^^~ So yeah. Whatever. So bored.   I wanted to go outside today after school but whatever. My sister's going outside and I have guitar lesson later so yeah. Nathan, Caleb, Joseph, and Timothy. Ew~ Haha! Bleecchhh~ Zoe and Ingrid would love to be in my class, maybe? Haha! Ingrid is probably going like "Whaaat?!" right now but yeah. Bleh. Whatever.  Haven't spoken to Ingrid in a while. The two of us need to talk. Mehe! ^^ Mystery Murder Night. Might talk then or not. Dunno. Whatever. Blah. So yeah. I'll wear my COWBOY HAT to church on Friday! ...or not! I don't know... if I feel like it. Well, gonna practise on guitar for now. Blog later... maybe. Might not be in the mood. Whatever. Going off for now. I'll read Wilfred's blog and then practise. Hehe~ Bye bye! Peace! XOXO *mwahzZ*

        Whoa. So much happening. Problems with [apple], [pear], [red], and Daniel Radcliffe! Haha! Yup! Daniel Radcliffe's the guy who plays Harry Potter in the movies. He says that he thinks Harry might die in the last book! Nooo! *sniff sniffzZ* But he's so cool! Haha! To be honest, I think Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is better looking than Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). Of course, I don't like it when Felton gels back his hair in the movie but he looks a lot better in the other pictures I've looked at it. Hehe ^^  *sighzZ* So bored. Not letting the [apple], [pear], and [red] problem get to me. [Pear] can think whatever [pear] wants... I don't give a shit anymore. Psht. Screw it.  What else is there...? Hmm, talked to Brian and Martin today about some stuff... I think I've decided something. Gotta find the right timing though ^^~! Haha! It was so funny during Science class with Brian, Martin L, and Martin Y! We played a game similar to Spin-The-Bottle. We spin the waterbottle and whoever it points to, the person who spun the bottle gets to ask that person a question and the person has to answer truthfully! Muahahaha! It was really funny! ^^ Those guys are so weird.  Something seemed to be bothering my alien today but he didn't say anything so blah. Hope that nothing really is wrong.  Well, that's it for now... blog later maybe
