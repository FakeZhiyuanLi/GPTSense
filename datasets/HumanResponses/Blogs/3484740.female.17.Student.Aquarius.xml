      Hmm...not a whole lot to say I don't guess. Other than today sucked seriously! Everything was fine actually, I got to the pool this morning, and I didn't vacuum because it was raining, and the rain was just going to cause more stuff to fall into the pool. So I sat there for a while, then a friend of mine showed up, and we hung out for a while, until another guy came, who swims like everyday. We were all hanging out and some chicks came and then these other people came. And they had like, 15 kids with them, which wasn't a problem. Everyone I saw was in their swimwear, except the first little girl who went in. Well I stopped her and told her that she couldn't swim in them, because they were not white shorts. Well her mom or whatever was like, no she has to swim in them or they will be seethrough. And she had a serious additude, and ya know, I let things slide half the time, but her additude just set me off. I said well I guess she can't swim then. And she started in on me at that point, and I was like, don't come up here talking to me like that, I run this pool and I don't have to let you swim in it. It's my decision and I don't have to take anything from you. So she was like, well we're going to go to the board and you'll see how long your job lasts. I just laughed, because I knew she couldn't get me fired or anything. So I called my boss and told her everything, and then they showed back up, just the one I got into it with and she brought another person. And the other person was like, are you the one mouthing my family? I was like, no, I simply told them the little girl couldn't swim with her shorts. They were not regular swimware, nor were they white. Well she had a problem with that and blah blah blah. Well then she was like, who is your grandma? I was like, you don't know my grandma. She was like, where is Sherly(which is the girl who ran the pool last year, who also has granddaughters, I'm just not one of them.) And I told her that Sherly no longer ran the pool this year, and she would have to take it up with the person who does. Well they left and later the board members came and talked to me, and they were totally fine. And they were basically, you know its a judgement call, and I said yea, if they had been nice I would have let the little girl swim. But they started in the second I said anything. And they acted rude when I checked to see if they had paid their dues, which I have to do. How should I know if they are paid or not? Ya know. But I didn't say anything when they did that, I let it slide. Well the board members were totally fine with everything, and my boss was like...no you're not getting fired. Lol, which I wasn't worried about..but ya know.  Well!!! Thats about all...too bad Aaron couldn't come today, I had wanted to talk to him about that last night...but it didn't work out too well.

      Hmm...today has completely sucked. Thats for sure. I'm not to sure what to do about Aaron, all I can do is sit back and let him decide. Which is fine. Apparently he needs something right now, and I'm not totally sure what that is, but I hope he figures it out. I really did enjoy talking with him, and yes, I did make him feel bad about talking to me more than once. But I know that more than once he would do things to try and get me to feel bad, or to think about things, like make me jealous and things like that. I try not to do that very often, but sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do.   Anywho - - I guess thats all for now. Not a lot to talk about. And I really don't need anymore comments on here, unless of course they are needed. Then yes, but as far as any others, just ignore this. This is for me, and the few people I've told about it. But I suppose it really doesn't matter, I can change anything I want whenever I want. So whatever. I'll write more later! Bye.

      Okay, first off..he hasn't been an ass to me lately until last night. Which, what I said last night was true, theres me, Jenny, Lyndsey, and whoever else. Which, I know of a few just by him telling me...also his comments like, "most of mine were virgins so theres no way I have anything" and I already know half of them were young. So my comment was very true. I did perhaps go to far with the 10 year old thing, but it was meant in a way, of me saying they were young. Which, compared to his age, they might as well be 10.   Yes, this is public, but no one can find it, at least, no one knows who I am if they do read it. Does it say my name anywhere? Does it have my picture anywhere? No...it sure doesn't. For that reason exactly. I started this ONLY because he wanted me too. He wanted me to start to Xanga one, he wanted me to continue the one he made for me a while back on his site, so I started this one. I'm not very good with words, so writing things down in a letter or on here is much easier for me than actually telling someone. Either way, the message still gets across. Its funny, since I was falling for him again. I couldn't handle the distance before, and now that I don't have a car, it would be really hard. He is busy, he is always talking about all the things he has to do, I don't want to mess things up for him. I was always doing something to screw things up with him, maybe not him, but with other people. People started to not like him or talk bad or whatever when we got together, things happened with teachers that never happened before. So yea, I didn't want to bring all that back on him. No I haven't told him this, but I really don't care.   So you can say whatever you want to say, it doesn't make a difference to me, but it would be very nice if he could grow up for a few minutes and let me tell him a couple of things that he needs to know. Perhaps he could shut up and actually listen to me and then quit talking to me. Not talking to him, would be completely fine. I don't need him, I have no desire to want to be with him anymore, so it really makes not difference to me. Yes, I did want to be with him a couple weeks ago, and I even asked him more than once to come see me. He came on bad terms and that was my fault as much as it was his. It didn't work out the way I had planned on him coming for the first time. But life goes on.   All I want is to say a few things and I'll be gone. If I'm a bitch, then hes a bastard. Because you can't judge until you know everything, and I'm sorry hun, you don't.

      For anyone who does come here to read this, who wasn't invited by me..I'm very sorry but there is nothing left to read. My privacy was invaded by someone and he decided he could inform everyone of this blog, which that was not the case. This is my blog, and if I choose to share it with him, thats my business. He had no right to share it with anyone else.

      It's not considered a damand, when you say it flat out. When you say something, I expect you to follow through. When I tell you something, I do it, and if I can't do it, I at least find a way to tell you I can't. That is something you have never done. The least you could do is let me know, I may only be a friend, but that shouldn't matter.

      I was hoping to have heard something by now, but I guess thats not going to happening, considering its already 9:00. I'm not too sure what to do actually, I guess give up. What else is there? I can't just sit here and wait around for nothing, which is exactly what I am doing. He can't "stop for me," just for other people, well that isn't going to work for me. Which is exactly what he does and how he talks, I'm not sure what the whole message thing was about, how there was only one nice message, perhaps that was directed at me, but I don't remember any messages that weren't nice. I got upset because he told me one thing and changed it at the last minute. I wouldn't have sat up for as long as I did had I known things were going to change, again. So I guess thats all I can say, whatever happens happens. Its all up to him now. I'm tired of it, and I quit. I have more important things to do and more important people to deal with if thats how hes going to be. I'm sure he had a few minutes today to say something to me. But thats okay too. Whatever he wants.

      Perhaps if I stop talking with him, things will be better. Things are actually fine when we do talk, and I totally understand that hes busy. I'm just tired of him saying one thing, and not even knowing if he'll be able to do it, and of course, he can't. Don't say anything! Just say I don't know, because you really don't know. It's not very nice to make someone think one thing and do another. The fact that he hardly enjoys talking to me at all helps my decision greatly. I know that because of the way he talks, which he does talk about it. Which is also fine. I have a pretty busy life myself, I spent way to much time at the pool last night searching for my keys, which I did find, but I shouldn't have had to even begin to look. They should have been left where I left them. It doesn't matter anymore. I believe I have made a good decision, and I might stick with it, I might not. We'll have to see what happens. Thats all for now. Thanks for kinda listening.

      Well, I hope my starting over on my blog makes things a little easier. I've had a lot of crap from people on here before, and I hope that has all stopped, and if it hasn't...then I suppose I will have to quit with my blog all together.   A lot has been happening, a lot that mainly has to do with Aaron. He has found a girl whom he likes, and I think he can be very happy with her. From what he says, she seems like a very nice person. Hopefully things with me and him and okay now too. We had our up and downs, we both did things to deliberately hurt each other in the last week, and after talking tonight for over two hours, I hope that has come to a stop. I think we have come to an understanding as to where both of us are in our lives...and we both just have to respect the others wishes, which we haven't been doing for quite sometime.  As far as everything else, all is pretty good. I got my first paycheck, over 300 dollars!! I get paid to basically sit on my butt all day! Who wouldn't want a job like that? I can't wait, in about 2 months I should have exactly what I want. A car!! I'm so excited! The bad thing that is happening soon, is I have to go to the dentist, and I believe I will be in some serious pain Thursday...but I'll live. Thats about all for right now. I'll write more later!! Bye!

      They make no sense. They say they like you, and then are talking to other chicks? Its very annoying, makes ya wanna turn gay! Not really! But sometimes it would have to be better than the alternative. A month and a half ago I went to town with a guy, thinking possibly it was cool again...and it turned out he wasn't. Of course. I'm never right when I want to be. I guess I should start getting used to it.  Work has been okay lately, except the other day. The girl that works on Thursday, told me she couldn't get the vacuum to work, which wasn't a big deal. It didn't need it. Well, I couldn't get it to work Friday either, so I called my neighbor(he does the pool stuff) and asked him if he could come and try and make it work. He said he would be there around 4 or 5. Well it was about 4:30 and I decided I might want to get in the pool, well I got on my bathing suit and everything, and only got my feet in basically and decided that no, he was coming and I better not get in just yet, and it was freezing. Well, he came about that time and I had my pants about half way on when he came up. He was like, no don't do that, I can't see your body if you do that. And I sat down and had my shirt and was about to put it on and he got up to go to the gate to get started with the vacuuming, and told me to not even put on my shirt, which I did anyway. By that time I was really starting to feel weird. And so we went and got the stuff, and started. He got it to work and so I vacuumed then because it needed it. And he kept making comments like, I'd enjoy this more if you were in your bathing suit. And then there was something in the pool, it looked like spit to me, and he was like, it looks like someone came in the pool, you haven't been having sex in here? And oh my gosh!!! And he said something about my ex, how he drives a little green truck...that he saw him at WalMart and said he was a jerk. Well, according to him, the only thing he said was that we broke up because we didn't get along. How is that being a jerk? Thats exactly what happened. Maybe he did something else. And he said something else about how the sex is good but its not everything. And he said more than once about me needing to take off my clothes, like one time he said do you have a boyfriend yet? And I said no not yet, and he was like...oh well thats because you don't take off your clothes, you gotta show these guys everything you have.  I had no idea what to do. I still don't know what to do. I told my mom and dad, they came to the pool later and I was like, okay...I don't care if the house is burning down, but if Jim is here, so are you. And they asked why and I told them. Well dad said I should tell my boss, which I think I should too...and I had planned on it today, but she never came back. But mom said I should wait and see if he does it again. Well if he went that far the first time, why wouldn't he do it again? I don't actually think he would try anything, but I can't be sure. The neighbor, his mom(I think) said that there was a girl that had a complaint on him before because he said inappropiate things and wanted to have an affair, but she didn't believe it because it was like "love at first sight" with him and his wife. I told the lady who I work with, and her husband over heard, and he was like...well thank you for telling me, I thought I might like him but now I know I don't, and hes the kinda guy that...would do something, at least say something to him. Which he said he would the next time he sees him. I don't want to start anything with the neighbors, but that was going a little to far I think. I don't know, I don't know what to do...any ideas would be wonderful!!

      Well... A LOT!!! has happened, which ahs to do with a recent post of mine, on June 13th I believe. My boss actually talked to the guy and everything, and we had a huge blow out at my house...and what not. I'm not going to go into any details, I don't believe its a good thing for me to do that anyway. So...perhaps one day soon I can write them all down. I don't know what is going to happen in the future...but we'll just have to wait and see like everything else.

      Well, I didn't think last night wasn't a bad thing. Everything seemed to be going very well...sure there were a couple things that made me uncomfortable, but I'll probably have that for a while. I'm sorry other people didn't think it worked out that way. But now that those people have read what I wrote on here, only somewhere else, maybe they will understand something else. I don't know that I wrote anything really worth reading, but maybe I did. I don't know...time will only tell.

      There is a bit to talk about now, its been a few days since my last post. I swear, if I didn't have someone asking about this, I wouldn't even keep up with it. Lol. But thats okay. I have almost 900 dollars set away for my car, and I found a cute one but dad doesn't want me to rush it. Which I can understand, but its really cute and it kinda...hit me the right way I guess. Haha, but it hit him the wrong way:(. But we'll see. The right one will be there, that I'm sure of. I know I need a car by next year...and I'll have one!  Okay, I was wrong about writing a lot, figured out a few things I have to have done in less than an hour. I'll have to write more later! Bye!

      Hmm...I don't think there is a whole lot new...but I guess there has been.  Nothing has changed with the pool guy, he hasn't came around or anything, except for him and his father calling me a whore in my garage...ya know. I've actually been having a bit of fun lately. Been able to hang out with some people. The other night I went out to a friends house and I brought my friend Twinkee with me, and he got drunk off some nasty stuff called Southern Comfort. And so he had to be home so I took him home and he wouldn't stay there and he jumped in the back of my truck and I was like, alright...you can come with me. So I went back and asked some of the guys to help me keep him there and so basically, we stopped on the road outside his house and dumped him out of the truck and drove off. It was kinda harsh, but he was okay. Then later we went and checked on him and he had thrown up everywhere, it was so nasty. Then tonight we went to Walmart because a guy had a blowout on his truck and needed a tire, then we went to KFC and saw Robin, a chick that this guy Mike is likeing, and came back to Twinkees and just hung out there until 12:30 and Kerry drove me home. I like going and hanging out, its different. I'm so used to just, sitting at the pool, then coming home and siting here, maybe talking on the phone or watching TV. Something different is nice once and a while.   But anyway...thats about all for now. I'll keep ya posted!

      Now that I don't have someone nagging me about writing all the time, I probably won't write very often at all. Which is totally fine with me. I haven't had time lately, last night was the first night in a couple days I've been home. I've spent the last two nights with some people I'm pretty close to. I'm very glad that this weekend is over! And I have almost all the money for my car, and I think I'm going to be getting the one I was talking about earlier. But we'll see. I guess thats all for now. To bad things arn't going to well with everyone. I wish things we're different, but they arn't. And I know its for the best, everyone is telling me it is..and has been telling me that for over a year now...I just never listened. Maybe I'll listen now. Who knows. Everything with other people is going great though! Cept Twinkee, hes getting on my nerves lately. Thats okay though, I think hes just upset with me so hes not caring anymore. Oh well. I'll write later maybe.

      Well I haven't posted in a while. A lot has happened! I got a car! And it should be all legal and in our name in less than a week and I can finally drive it. Its been like, 8 months now, I can't imagine anothe week will kill me! Haha. Its cute too, cuter than my other one(at least I think so..other people might not).  I'm not sure what is happening with Aaron, but I would love to be able to figure it out. I can't tell what he wants, I'm sorry that I like someone, but thats how it is. I would like to know what that post was about though. ''Just a song''. There has to be more than that. I dont know.  Anyway, I'm not going to write anything else for now. Maybe in a bit. Bye!

      I hate people who think they are so much better than everyone. Although, it is quite nice when it all comes crashing down at their feet. He always thought he was better than other people, and so proud of himself because he had the car, and the girl and all the friends. Its sad that he doesn't have any of that now. I felt for him, you know, I really did. And I tried to talk to him. But it just made me realize how much of a bastard he really is. And, apparently so have his friends. Since well, he doesn't have any. I'm done with it now though, he can do whatever he wants, whoever he wants and just screw up his life all he wants. I really don't care this time. Life is going great right now, me and Kerry are doing wonderful. Hes going through some tough times with his life and different things I can't really talk about, but between the two of us we're wonderful. Since we've been together, there is probably 4 nights that either of us haven't spent the night with the other, and we aren't getting tired of each other by any means. I realize we just started, and we might before to long, but I'm not thinking about that kind of thing right now. The only time I get upset is when I contact him, like today. I thought I would be nice and contact him, but apparently that was too much for him to handle. I think he thinks to hard about things, and maybe doesn't know what choice he should make, so he makes the one that hurts him the most? At least, thats what it seems like to me. But like I said, it really doesn't matter. I know what its like to not have any friends, and well, its very hard to get through life like that...so I hope everything works out for him in the end. It doesn't look to good now, but it will be better after a while. It always does.   I guess thats all I have to say for now, I'll write more later, now that I don't feel bad about writing about the good things I have going on in my life!

      So much is going on. I don't even know where to start. I got a&nbsp;car! And it should be legal within a couple days, so I can actually start to drive it. As of right now...a plan of mine is to be going to Texas next Monday for a few days. Stay with Dawn for a night maybe, see a bunch of people, get some new school clothes. I'm excited. &nbsp; Work is alright for right now. The other day these drunk people came, and we really can't do anything about drunk people, just have to let them in ya know. So they went in and well their little boy that was almost 2, was playing with the gate, and I very nicely went and held the gate shut and told him he needed to go to his mother and she basically looked at me like how dare I do that. Then the dad was like why are you being hateful to him. I don't see how I was being hateful, I simply told him he couldn't play with the stupid gate. When they left they called me an ass hole, and a lady on the board stood up and asked what was wrong. And then there was a meeting the same night, and they came back, still drunk and was crapping about me, but they kinda brushed it off because a lady and her husband on the board were sitting right there, and they said I kicked them out, well trust me, they left very willingly. Hehe, I'm just glad people were sitting there!  &nbsp; I'm not sure what else is going on, nothing I can really think of I don't guess. Maybe I'll be hearing from someone one of these days, if not, I guess thats okay too. We'll just have to wait and see.

      Well, Peaches is gone. If he was going to come back, he would have by now. I'm very sad, he was always my favorite kitty, he was my only kitty actually. At least, the only cat I've ever had that I could call my own. Twinkee found his collar on the side of the road about half a mile from my house. The weird thing was, he brought it, thinking it might be mine...and didn't say anything to me about it for like 30 minutes after we met up at the pool. Then he was like, hey I found a cat collar. And I was like, oh yea...thinking we could put it on the little kitty of Kerrys that has now moved in, and I turned around to look, and knew it was mine by all the fray he had caused from scratching it. I like freaked out then, and was like where did you find it and everything. We had been looking for Peaches before then, mom was out looking for him and everything, and I just brushed it off, oh...he'll come back, don't worry. Sad thing is, he isn't coming back. He might, I suppose. But if he got attacked, I think he would have made it home by now, he wasn't&nbsp;far from home, so I don't think he's coming back. I mean, this kind of thing happens.   Thats about all I guess. School starts in like 2 weeks, I'm so ready, but I'm really not. Last year, its really scary. This is going to be a very weird year. We have someone moving into our house, which will make it even more weird. But fun I hope. As long as I don't get tired of him being around. But we'll see. Anyway, wish me luck on Peaches...!

      Well, I think it is official, that Peaches is really gone. Also, for anyone reading this that knows about Peaches, my friend did not bring Peaches to me, he brought me his collar. I think the person I told thought I meant Peaches, but I meant his collar. I have not seen Peaches since the last time he was here with me, which I am very happy about. It would be a lot harder on me if I was to see him any other way. :(  Everything else is going pretty good. School starts Wednesday! I'm excited...but then I'm not. Its going to be over before it starts, but it'll be okay. I have some pretty cool classes I think, one is Stagecraft. And we get to be in charge of the Drama Homecoming float, and other stuff for plays and stuff. We don't have a lot of money, so its a pretty good class to take your senior year, because you probably won't do much. Which is also very cool.  As far as me and Kerry, we're good. It finally sank in the other day that he has no where else to go but here. Now that his mom has left and everything, this is his home. Hes okay with it I think. But it probably gets to him sometimes, I think it would anyone. We kind of got into it tonight, he has been saving change for like 2 years and has a little over 200 dollars, and lately I've put in some as well, no more than 25 dollars I'd say, but I still put something in. And about a week and a half ago we decided to save 1 dollar bills, and I know I've put in at least half of that, and we have about 70 I believe...and tonight we were at Sonic and he asked for my ones and I said sure and gave them to him, and I don't even remember what was said, but he said that I didn't put any in, maybe 5 dollars but the rest was his. Well I didn't like that because its not true, I know I've put in like half. Because for the last week and a half he really hasn't had any money. Thats why when he says he wants me to put his money in my bank account, I won't. I do not want any confusion as to what is mine. I don't want to be selfish, but I don't want something like tonight to happen, with a greater amount. So I'm going to eliminate that possibility at all. Anyway, so we kind of got into it, and he wouldn't even see where it made me mad. But oh well. It'll pass.  Mom and dad are pretty crazy right now, we're running low and its getting very stressful. I went to the dentist not to long ago and they gave me 20 pain pills. Well, I've had 3, dad has had 3, and Kerry had 1, and I have one left. And mom swears that she isn't taking them. I know she has. Thats 12 pills gone...and shes the only one left. She was very defensive when I asked her about it last night, and I talked to dad about it this morning, and he said that it wasn't a subject he wanted to bring up to her because she would deny it. But for almost as long as he has known her, she has liked her pain pills. I don't understand what for though. Nothing major has happened to her for her to be in so much pain or whatever. Dad, yes...but nothing has happened to her. I needed them the day of and the day after my dentist appointment. But thats a good reason...she has none. I don't understand why she lies about it though, it doesn't make sense. Dad told me to leave it alone, so I guess I will. It still pisses me off though.  Anyway, thats about all for now. Its been a while since I've written, and I'm sure it will be a while before I write again. So...Until next time!
