      i had work last night and today. my legs r killing me. i am so tired but i wudnt trade it for the world. i luv it, it is so much fun.   this whole thing with tiffany is way out of hand. i hate what it is doing to all of the girls. i am kinda sry the sisterhood broke up, but i think it is about time. we r all getting too old and our scheduales r all really different.   but, i life will go on and we will all get thru it. i will c everyone one tuesday. have a happy memorial day!

      Ok, i kno i already wrote one today, but oh well. today was better then this morning. i talked to everyone and i think we have decided to offically dismember the sisterhood. i really wanted to thank everyone for saying that tiffany does not have the right to kick me out, she doesnt own the group. i love all the school group. and i hope tiffany will realize everything i told her.

      i just want to thank cat for being there for me after what happened last night. now that i am out of the "sisterhoood" (poison kool-aid) i found that i will live. i thought it wud b really bad, but it wasnt. tiffany started yelling at me for what i did, well u kno, sry. she is everyones friend and we all like her. i dont get y we cudnt just have her in the group (poison kool-aid) and not everyone had to tell her everything they told evreryone else. i was under the empression, from julie, that tiffany and paige left the "sisterhood" and we told cat weeks ago that when paige left, she could b in. but no, ppl cudnt just leave well enought alone. look, i am sry that i didnt ask everyone, but in all honesty, no had a problem with it except for one person (i thought tiffany and paige left, so i didnt bother to talk to them cause they had not vote on it anyways). after talking to cat for about an hour last night i have come to the conclusion that life will go on and as long as u have one true friend who u can talk to and bitch to, life will be ok. thanx cat. i am sorry for telling cat she cud be in the group when some ppl had a problem with her.   (and tiffany or who ever reads this. let me ask u a question, if u werent invited to a birthday party, who u want someone to say "oh yeah, i am having a party and u r not invited to it cause i dont like u. i wudnt. so last night, tiffany yells at me cause i told the "sisters" who were invited not to tell her. then someone told tiffany who told paige and all hell broke loose. i thought it wud b better if she didnt kno. but now next time it will kno to tell tiffany and paige what they r not invited too.   i also want to let tiffany kno, that it is harder to plan things with her cause a, she work, b, she goes to college and has a different scheduale. so i am sorry. but its hard. i dont think she understands that. we plan things last minute alot, so we dont always call her, agian, cause we dont want to rub it in her face. and when we plan something a week or so in advance, then we tell she and see if you want to come.   and i am sorry if paige feels left out but she didnt sit with us alot the past few months. and if she didnt sit with us cause she felt left out, then how is she supposed to feel back in if she doesnt talk to us. we dont c her, how can we read her mind?)

      i am kinda of upset right now. i am mad that andi left the "sisterhood". and i am confused, i dont kno if we still have one or not. but, w/e. no word on barry yet, but i dont care. i am so glad i got it off my chest and he knos how i feel. oh, yesterday was the funniest thing ever. is still cant believe they actually made out, but it was still awsome. altho, i want to kno what is going on the the sisterhood. now that paige and tiffany r gone, what do we do. i mean, what is it anyways. i think that julie is right, that we shud just "take it apart" and forget it. just all be friends that we can all toalk to.  but here is something, what is up with mia and brian. i mean, i wish mia wud have just told me that brian felt left out. i will talk to him tomorrow, something i dont think i have ever done. and find out how i am making him feel left out. i will try harder not to, but i wish she just wud have told me personally and not ignore me when i asked her. i mean, he is the one who always makes fun of me and crisizes me. i had no clue he felt left out. mayb that is just how he is. makes fun of ppl to get there attention. i dont want him to feel that way, i care about him, and he is my friend. so, i will try.

      hi everyone! this is my first blog. i am proud of myself for writing it. a high tech journal if u will. anyway... today i finally had the "balls" to tell barry that i liked him. finally i said to myself. it actually wasnt that bad. i am so releaved that i got it off my chest and now am able to let him know how i feel. he said he was surprised, if i were him, i wud have thought it was kinda obvious. he said that i was funny and nice, too and that he wud think about it. how sweet. i guess inside i am letting preparing myself for a big let down. cause u kno, its me, and things never go my way when it comes to this sort of thing. but, nevertheless, i am still hopeful.   my conformation went well tonight. i did my speech and the prayers i was supposed to. my mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, great grandpa, grandma and brother came. i was really happy that they all did.   to anyone who reads this, please try to cheer me up by saying that barry likes me too. cause, i am totally trying not to get excited about it.   good night!
