      At least I do. Here are my two lessons from today.  Lesson 1: Don't risk making a fool of yourself unless you are actually a fool or you won't mind it if they treat you like one. To cut a long story short, I am an idiot. I have officially decided that when I get a crazy idea in the future, I will:  1.Write it down on a piece of paper  2.Read it carefully  3.Think  4.Throw the piece of paper in the garbage, because it is nothing but a crazy idea and I am a grown-up, mature and intelligent person who needs to act responsibly.   Lesson 2: Meeting a person through his graduate school web-site is a crazy idea. His online entry is not an open invitation for me to e-mail him, call his office, and talk to him!!!  Moving onto another topic, I am in the process of changing apartments and getting ready to go home for a month. I have started packing and unpacking in a very automatic way, almost without actually paying attention to what I am doing. Living out of suitcases has transformed me from being a light-hearted idealist into a boringly pragmatic person. Now, I get really attached only to objects that are light, unbreakable,  and don't require care when transporting. I am sure that at least 2 of you reading this still remember how we came to the USA with 2 bags and they were both delayed for 6 days; an experience, which has taught me to carry true essentials in my backpack, not just my 23-year old teddy bear (yup, he was born on July 10th too when my dad bought him at a store around the corner from the hospital). Today, I managed to separate all my stuff into three piles: many objects that I like and need, some objects that I like but don't need, one object that I don't like AND don't need. Tomorrow, I hope to actually pack the first pile into boxes, go carefully through the second pile, and send one purple pen with a grinning yellow fish attached to its top to one of you as a token of my friendship. Any takers?

      So, here is my brand new corner of virtual reality. Welcome! I hope that this blog will be a good way to keep in touch and partially make up for the ever-growing lack of possibilities to chat over Chai Latte's at Irving's in State College/The Coop at Colgate/The Barge in Hamilton/Jimmy's Ice Cream House in Sofia/any-other-coffee-place-around-the-world. To those of you who know me well: expect the usual, albeit it in an unusual form. To those of you who don't know me well: brace yourselves!
