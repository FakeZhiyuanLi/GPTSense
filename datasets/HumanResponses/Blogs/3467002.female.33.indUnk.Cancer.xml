      I am broken But I will mend  I am sorrow But I will smile again  I am lost But I'll find my way  I get confused But I'll remember what to say  You changed my world Then ran on your way Left me to stumble, Bend at knee, Call out your name  Took me so long To learn to breathe again Such a simple thing And you took it all away  Now I'll think back Dream on To better days Know I loved you then Couldn't change it Wouldn't if I could  But will you look back To that whispered memory, See me standing there, Know yourself the fool, And cry  FORGIVE  to the wind?

      I've often wondered Why writer's block Must weigh so heavily When it weighs at all Never the feather's touch On furrowed brow A moment without a word Then flowing as they did before This curse, this joke, this enemy Laying such tonage Atlas would quail Bend at knee Drop tear and cry out Seven years to be so cursed And I wonder Why didn't I glue that damned mirror Back together When I had the chance...

      Gray and silver tones &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cascading over a gentle laugh Emotions racing with the wind &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wild horse &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open hand &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No words needed Arms to enfold my soul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tender lips with dual needs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A heartbeat to drown the Alone I call you Rat &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we laugh &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we cry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we are. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My friend As you have always, As you will always be. Distance matters not. I can still feel you near. Fluid, swift strike. Like lightning. That such has touched my life. No scars. I have been highlighted. A streak through my soul. I touch with hesitant fingers, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fearful, should it disappear. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You tingle my senses. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I thank you.

      If you had only told me. I lie in this wooden bed, My arms crossed over my breast, And look up at you To see your tears raining down upon me.  If you had only told me. I never was loved -- Gave up looking for it, Never knew To turn to you To find that elusive look. I could easily have loved you As easily As I breathed. It was within me. I had no where else To place it. If you had only told me.  Now, when I would touch you, I cannot sense your warmth. Is it the bandages That bind my wrists Or is it what they try to hide That keeps me from you? I would whisper words of love To free your soul of torment But for the threads That lace my thoughts Behind my teeth.  My heart reaches out to you With its silent beat As you kneel at my side To give your grief To the empty shell That mirrors Who I once was. Your hair Gently caresses The hand you hold So near your heart.  I watch helplessly As they pull you from me, Your body Heavy with sorrow. Your eyes look upon me Once more; Then twice For you have seen. The tears slide Effortlessly Down my pale cheek As the nerves Of the hand you held so near, So dear, Twitch one last time On my silken pillow. You never told me. You Never Told Me  If you had only told me. I lie in this wooden bed, My arms crossed over my breast, And look up at you To see your tears raining down upon me.  If you had only told me. I never was loved -- Gave up looking for it, Never knew To turn to you To find that elusive look. I could easily have loved you As easily As I breathed. It was within me.

      Plagued by life's trivialities, By body aching, My heart wrenching, By mood darkening, My nerves shredding.. And the phone rings. In irritation Do I excavate, Unbury this unwanted treasure, Sighing, For lack of name To put to shrill ring, And it is you. You. Simply you. Greeting me with teasing query, With bright heart, With gentle love, And I am undone. In so few words Do you erase me Start me over Build me Beautify me Gentle me Tame me Lift me Love me Name me... And I am yours.  And I try: To tease you Love you Endear you As I have tried -- With but few others... To be for you All I ever was For them. Yet that, and more, For you. Again, By you, Am I undone. Seductress By no means, Moving to tease you, Please you, Entice you... Play my words along your flesh Where handstonguemindbody Are so eager to follow. And deftly, Without effort, You strip me down, Lay me bare, Still my hands My tongue My mind My body. Drawing from me What no other Ever Has. Shy girl Speechless woman Untried lover, Virgin-born In my desire for you. Finding myself Unsure, New, In finding myself In you.

      Empty my house of you Your scent Your words Notes Poems Condom Handed to me In another state Of geography And mind I like to pretend That I REALLY Mattered That you REALLY Loved me Know I don't know What is real What was us Just see it all in reds Pools of my tears Mixed with blood of heart Loss of spirit And faith Things I thought gone Resurrected by you And sacrificed once more On altar of your happenstance The gesticulation Of enchantment That was your mantra For my ears My heart My body Play me once more Fine tune me To your desire I miss this song Our melody Even knowing Was a one hit wonder Lie to me One more time So I can pretend Was real Was love Was us  Am sorrow.

      I hear my voice Echo In an empty world. I am surrounded By friends, Family, Strangers. Yet I am alone. There is an empty Space Within my soul, One that threatens To overwhelm. There are so many Voices; So many, many Lives. They mean nothing To me. And I? I mean nothing At all. I am an irrational number In a negative world. Magnetic refraction Is the only science I know.

      Everyone has a little Hope in their hearts, Change in their pockets, Love in their dreams. But who, truly, Who, really, Has a load of toenail clippings In their backyard swings? A tubful of cottage cheese curd? Well, now, let me find the right wordâ€¦ Would it be worth the words on this page, To be writing like this at such a ripe old age? Ah, I digress, I've wandered askew. But if you were me, what the hell would you do?

      Pick up lines Falling So many winter leaves In a season of lust Libidinous tidal waves "Cut to the chase" As if brand new This line Fishing Diving That pearl Of passion Momentary moans A scream to rip the night Pave the path An end To aching need Body pacified In passing touch And spent condoms

      That's what they called him Or what he answered to It didn't really matter In the end No matter what he ate It all came out in a splatter Outcast Shunned Set aside as just not quite right Frankie's eating habits Were causing quite the stir So he decided If I'm going to suffer for it Be shoved aside Might as well make a living And finger-painted His way Into the feces-painting Hall of Fame For his V8 Fishy Great Ode to Odor Art

      Hold me in your arms An' rock me 'til Sun shoots down Moon Over yonder hill.  I'm fighting immortal fears, Striking out at life's lies, Searching for your forgiveness, Finding damnation in your eyes.  People mock me As I run down a dark street, Trying to break free From Nightmare's insane beat.  Our trust in one another Dies with my dry tears. Losing you Was among my greatest fears.  I sit near freezing flames, Burning rain falls from the sky. My heart is cold and you've left me; Now I wish only to die.

      Sitting here, rain falling down A sea of thoughts enfolds me Holds me Within myself Gathering my wits And hoping for inspiration My face misted with dew My future misted by uncertainties Knowing that while it's all Just too much at times Feeling like I never know enough I am enraptured Lifted By the one thought That one bit of fact That transcends all else No matter my path No matter the obstacle No matter when it all ends I am not alone Never alone For he is here Standing in the wind His hand brushing mine As we bare ourselves To this murky future This muddied way Existing in visions	 Through misted rain

      My heart screams bloody murder As my soul weeps itself to death I am my own end Brought on by my own means I lifted the filthy cleaver To my brazen throat, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gushing-swishing-wishing Full of desires yet to be unleashed Upon this, the Un-Holy land. What mark shall I make Other than the gore-trace of the fleshy sack Out of which I was spawned as a heathenistic curse? My demonic bent is the one called care -- Too much -- too often -- without cause nor reason. And who shall I take down with me To my shadow grave six feet within A facade of faces, names, games? Call me slut if you're from the east, Alone-scared if you hail from the west. I'll be/do whatever I have to. Just don't ask me to be me. It's bad enough as it is...... Haven't you gasped enough? Need I strangle your more With my response to a question &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you never asked? Cut me now, before I strike again And take you with me -- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down to my home &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the depths &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of hell.

      I have become the means to my own end I have offered myself up -- Blood, Bones, Heart, Soul, Fears, Hopes, ALL A sacrificial offering To an insane god Rabid foam dripping from perfect lips His feral grin my reward A broken spirit my curse He is laughing at me This bemused deity Relishing my sorrow Feeding off my pain Self doubt Feeding on his pleasure I am my own ruin I have set my own throat To such wicked sharp desires A belief that I am not alone. Not again. Not anymore. Sad fealty, A failure in dues to Mad Cupid.

      I'm lying here, on my back Warm breezes caress my flesh Hearing the seagulls, the slap of water on sandy shore Knowing myself at peace And wondering what it is that I have forgotten That inner nagging feeling That I can't seem to let go of... That knowledge that tells me this isn't real This is but a dream, but a hope, but a far cry  From where I really am And I open my eyes, lift them, see that these sunny sands Are but bright hospital lights The cries of seagulls the voices of my family Their sorrow rising as a chorus of mourning birds In a cold square hospital room Filling up the corners and chasing my mind back Back away from what I have seen What I have lost My brother, adrift in a sea of stillness And we, we sorry souls We who have lost him Left on these arid tropic sands, to wave our goodbyes.

      I free myself Of loving you Slipped from the noose Spread these feathers Sodden with mine own tears Salt water my mainstay My downfall Shriek forth my victory Raptor's call takes wing Shivers through winter's wind And I know myself Wild Woman Child No more Laughter trembling forth Maniacal joy A treble of your sorrow You Standing there Useless jess of a wedding band Rolling loose in your hand Watching Helpless Lost Alone Knowing. Too late. I hear you no more, Lost in the clouds, Feeling myself your last breath Knowing my freedom in your death.

      Oh quiet lake, I sit at your edge &nbsp;  as a disciple &nbsp;  at the feet &nbsp;  of his master.  I ask that you reveal to me &nbsp;  the knowledge, &nbsp;  the wisdom, &nbsp;  the secrets &nbsp;  of your years.  Your peaceful waters, &nbsp;  spread out before me, &nbsp;  show the calm patience &nbsp;  man has yet to learn.  And what do I offer &nbsp;  in payment?  I cannot assure you &nbsp;  of uncluttered waters, &nbsp;  nor of an existence &nbsp;  in the future, &nbsp;  and not &nbsp;  of the ageless forest &nbsp;  to embrace you &nbsp;  in its loving charms.  Alas, I see naught &nbsp;  that I might offer you.  And so you see, &nbsp;  man indeed &nbsp;  needs to be taught &nbsp;  by his betters.

      If I moan, and call out your name, Will you treat me just the same? If I make love to you, hold you near, Open myself to you, call you dear, Will you want to talk as we do now? Will you become the dew on my brow As I die inside and weep your memory While you break my heart & dismember me? Are you the risk I should take The potential for another mistake.. I'm wanting to have faith, to believe So weary of hoping, too tired to grieve Wanting for this to be more than the rest Needing it, but forgot how to judge what's best Tell me.. is this where we are to begin, Or will it end as penance for some past sin?

      What it is to ache Tears down too hot face Free will to care Heart to see Soul to know Spirit to want All these, Oh, Father, I beg thee Take back from me Take love from me Take knowledge Take understanding I would be  Numb To it all Dumb  To a fault Knowing no more sorrow No more loss So weary Of missing Needing Feeling Let me be, Oh, Father Let it go Sacrifice no more Teach me alone Teach me deaf Teach me blind And let me forget To hurt To break To live on Without.

      I'm as subtle as a bitch I heat. Yet I fail to catch your eye. My spoken words mean nothing. It's what my heart is saying That matters. But how do you make the deaf hear Of the blind see? It's easier than making You care. For the sake of friendship I reveal none of my true thoughts. This in itself is destructive. I open my hand,  You close your heart. I am a study For your divining eyes. Is this the root of your thoughts? Would you like to dissect me? I can understand. I do resemble a frog. Awkward and green; Eyes that coldly stare. Here. I have made the first incision. See how my soul bleeds? I shall guide you. Turn from me once more. There. My heart is in two. And for the final stroke, Prove my non-existence With your x-ray eyes. You cannot - will not see me. What is not seen does not exist.

      This is how I miss you, How I kiss you, How I love you. To touch you again. My hands on your chest, Palms flat, Gliding, Up, Over Your shoulders, Fingers trace and linger Over rise of  clavicle, These cups of flesh formed As if to receive my kisses, These hollows At the base of neck and shoulder. I plant them there, Letting them nurture And grow, Climbing as tender vines Up jaw line To the fountain Of your mouth, And am refreshed By soft breath of life, Your exhalation Of passion, Of peace, My arms wrapped â€˜round you, Holding your warmth to my own. Soft, serious eyes, So dear to my own vision, I am lost in you, Drowning in your touch, Alive in your presence, Wanting to kiss The tip Of Each Loving  Finger, Followed by gentle press Of lips to flesh of palm, A seal of my love for you.   How I miss The all of you With the all of me. The scars and moles That mark you. I know you By these, too. Miss the feel of them, Part of how I know Casual touch Is touching you, And no other. I miss the way You get that twinkle To your eye, Mischievous smile, Gently teasing me. Your passionate, Hungry arms That night. Caressing graze  Of your hands On the curves Of my inner arm, Standing in sunshine, And in love, With you. You are my happiness. Waiting, Ever waiting For that moment When your heart Races â€˜gainst mine, Calming slowly, Flesh to flesh, Weary Tangle of limbs, Snarled in adoration, Wanting it to last Forever.

      Not again I tell myself this I try to believe this Make it my mantra, my sigh in the night And hope that it will show me my path But again, it is Wrapped round my heart My throat My self, my inner self And I know myself lost Lost to that feeling of needing Wanting Hoping Yet again For that moment, that greedy, breathless moment In which I am swept up from who I am And remade by those three words Those three little words But again, it is the wrong three "It is over."

      The sins of the fathers, For three generations to follow. This is our debt? How we must pay? Our errors for our heirs? Enacted vicariously From this generation, To the next, And the next? I propose heresy. Genetic echoes Silenced. Karmic reverberations Dispensed. Do you see? I say no more.  Stamped by their mistakes Just as surely As their better traits. Look you, Here, At this. JFK, Both senior and junior. Rugged good looks, Outdoor vigor, Wicked charm And nasty penchant For dying too soon.  And,  Here, Elvis. His little Lisa Marie. Songbird, Sexual sneer, Hip sway, All his way. Will it stop there? Or will she mimic His very end? And forever Be sighted At 7-11, Reduced to conspiracy theory And legend.  To my own family, I turn. Grandfather, Molested my mother. Brother, Molested me, And, now, His step-daughter. Father, Accident-prone, Shy half his finger. My other brother, Accident-prone, too. Shy his life.  And I, I am told, I Am the mirror image Of my paternal grandmother. She is etched In my features. Not five months ago I survived The same surgery That took her life. But no. By word of my father, It was a broken heart That stilled her breath. Grief in love Snuffing that spark.  I say no. No. If I am to die, I die a heretic, Whole of heart, Old of age, Bearing my own sins Alone To my grave, Taking with me Her face, But no more than that. I entreat you, Let your sins Die with you. Leave our children as a legacy, Never again as penance.

      I Am a poem of pale A sonnet To the office worker Ode To the untraveled To the overworked The downtrodden The hopeless I am pasty In lack of motion Some try to cheer me "oh, no, dearest.. Tis porcelain fair, you are" And I guffaw Snort Furthermore Titter Come Dance with me In a heathen throw And chant Worshiping the gods Of office dictates And company morale I am queen Of my own ineptitude A peon To be worshiped.

      Grasp the Alone. Drink him in As the finest of elixirs. Taste of his dark solitude. Hear him laugh, Cold, hollow, echoing sound, As he pulls you under, Embracing you with gentle violence. Touching your soul Caress of fear Caress of death Caress of Alone. He is the core, The embryo of darkness In the womb of every light, And he knows the meaning Of my being, The talk of my sight:  Victims of a neo-past Stumble by, Shuffling in their haste, Fumbling uselessly With the broken dreams That have scarred their decayed hands; All symptoms of a love affair, The mortal encounter, With the Alone.

      They say That life is perception: I breathe, therefore I am. Eye of the beholder. They say that existence Is what we make of it. It is chicanery, A sleight of hand A joke, a play, A rerun That hasn't improved For the repeat viewing. I have come to see it, With my beholden eye, As what life would make of us. It is mythos, A fantastic creature of the fancy, That would have us believe That we have any choice at all, Any direction to give to our paths. Come with me, I entreat you. Join me. Realize that we, Fellow fools, Are merely the stepping stones, The means to an end, A cosmic joke, Worm on the hook, Cast from a broken mold And discarded To make of this What we will. Welcome to the dance, With your broken feet, And no sense of rhythm.

      Have you ever killed? Have you ever held a small animal &nbsp;  beneath water? With your bare hands? Have you ever been clawed st &nbsp;  by tiny paws As they try to escape? Have you ever watched the bubbles &nbsp;  as they struggle In your grasp?  And have you held a baby bird &nbsp;  beneath water With your bare hands? Have you ever been pecked at &nbsp;  by a tiny beak? Have you felt sodden feathers &nbsp;  beat helplessly At your fingers?  Or have you lifted the dripping body &nbsp;  from beneath the water To find that it wasn't yet lifeless?  Have you ever choked down tears As you plunge your hand into the water &nbsp;  Once again?  If only broken tails and limbs could heal. And if only felines would nibble on popcorn &nbsp;  Instead.  Have you ever believed &nbsp;  that drowning was less painful?  Were you unable &nbsp;  to snap a neck, &nbsp;  to bash a head, &nbsp;  to poison a body?  And after the killing time was over.... &nbsp;  after the tears and pain could be ignored..... &nbsp;  for a little while.... Have you ever been told That just before death in a drowning, &nbsp;  Your lungs --  Burst.

      Wolf eye, glimmer bright, Manâ€™s city Shining in natureâ€™s dark face, Winking, blinking your knowledge, Your feral light Peering up at this metal bird, This blasphemous mark, Human wings spreading Over lady night, Marring star-kissed breast. I can see you are amused, Delighted, By such foolish whim, Our need To step blithely Into windy death, Break free of motherâ€™s embrace, Scoff at the soil And cry aloud! Our freedom, Lost  In jet wake and thundercloud, Swallowed by lightningâ€™s kiss.

      Opened my eyes To a crystal love, Flying on the wind With wings of a dove.  Reached out for you, Embraced a heart so cold. Singing a suicide song, Diamond tears turn to gold.  Turn back the clock, Let love live on. Tried to stop you, But you were gone.  A breach-birth romance Hanging by a malignant thread You ended it all With wrists of scarlet red.  Lover's death, Bells toll. They're puttin' my babe Into a dead man's hole.

      Been livin' a soap opera life Channel won't change And my visions stay the same Walkin' in a daydream It's been a nightmare all along He died and left me behind Gotta learn to live without him When every day seems to scream his name I see his face in the angels Hear his voice in my sweating fearful nights Wrap his love in my heart And try not to ache It's amazing The dust of his funeral, Shook free from my feet And settled on my soul Such a bright light, Snuffed and left me in the dark.

And the saddest, the most bitter pill of all, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is that I too, have no choice but to be what they are, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be human.

You are my morning  You are my evening You are my dental bill You are my carbonated pimp daddy I am hooked on you As child to mother's milk I suckle on you to make it through my day, My life I've bathed in you Been lifted by your syrup of life And been cast down by the demon of flat But you rise again, rise in me My sweet narcotic

      You wind your words Around their hearts Reel them in On a line A hook of verb and simile You bait them Leave them breathless Wanting more Understanding little Their sighs And coos A caress to your ego Feel yourself aroused Their limpid eyes Fluttering at your guile Erotic sonnets The groundwork To a rumpled bed and gasping breath And after it all When the silence fills the air And they have gone Carrying away folded paper Bits of carefully creased words Your signature on their souls You find that you have seduced The art of alone

      I like the effects Of sex On the nerves Of my Inner curves. The sweetest embrace: Face to face, Thigh to thigh. I love the thrill When you fulfill. Skin on skin. They call this A sinâ€¦. The physical equation For love, Our "punishment" From above. Forever to touch And caress, Never saying no; Always, always yes! They say "Love the sinner, Not the sin!" There's no way For anyone to win. Love the sinner, Commit the sin! Deny the sin And you Cannot Love the sinner!

      I have gathered my memories This day Of the way things were Of the way I had wished Things Were In my childhood And strewn them at my feet Coral and pebbles interlace With each fragmented thought A collage of pain A mural of wistful losses And I realize This pain This sorrow That I have carried For, oh, too long How it has become me Colored me In shades of umber night Tainted my taste For life Left me To echo In tears and disonance Reverberations Across the latticework Of my soul And so I look to you You who shines So brightly In your heart of hearts Embracing it all Laughing Even through your own pain And I am amazed Wonderstruck Once again By the beauty of you The simplicity of your being A complexity of spirit As no other You have reached out Taken my hand Lifted me free Of the darkness That I used to be And I say to you Namaste My love So you have taught me So we are And so it shall be

      When the nights are empty And the days are long When minutes last forever And joy passes me by When all hope is gone And despair ever present I turn to you And I find my peace in you  When my soul is set adrift Wanders aimless in the dark When fears rise up And pull me down When life gets to be too much And happy moments all too few I turn to you And I find my peace in you  Ever unsettled You calm my spirit Ever without You fulfill my need Ever confused You set my mind at ease I turn to you And I find my peace in you  Friend Confidante Lover Muse Man My all And all that I am I turned to you And found my peace in you.

      What men die in Women were maid for Is never fast enough And always So many feel a dis To, for, from And I think All any of us  Are trying to do Is figure out What will serve us In serving this life Our purpose Drive Desire Path What are we to do? With whom? And for what motivation? What grand purpose Shall I live for? Die for? Cry out for? Or shall we go gentle Into that good night Some failure Of a grand poem Our only requiem?

      Delicacies of life Oceanic symphony Repast of man's passing fancy Would that it were that simple Lazy dance of life Flip of fin, flash of scale Cool waters to be breathed in As we dance amongst seaweed columns And undulate to a seaside melody Something finite and out of reach We plodding, land bound fools Look out to sea Think of mermaid, of legend, of siren's call wishing we were part of it Once more Reverse our evolution Find peace in earth's salt womb Fade and pale no more Dry sunlight Lost dream

      I get this sinking feeling Every time I lift pen, set it to paper Find myself without words Without expression Just an arid drift of particles Dangling metaphors  A haze of verbs That lead no where Have no action Suck me under Bleed me dry So I resort to that last act That last attempt To wring one more verse Out of my ill-tempered muse And I fall back on rhyme Without reason Poetry without form And I choke On that hated tendency To insult Seuss, Silverstein And put Potter to tears For there is no meter In this damed poem And me without a dime.

      I wear my past wounds Like a family crest. I'm howling in rage, Sounding my pain for the world to hear, Coming off in a whimper, And waxing morbid in my dire need. I'm tearing the flesh of the hand That reaches out, Lashing out at all who draw near. IneedyouHateyouLoveyouFearyou Do you dare the fangs For the heart that lies beneath? The mad looks I give, Insanity cupped in longing, Driving off the gentle touch As I shrug Back Into my comfortable despair.

      A tango of insecurities dancing in the darkness of my mind. Life crumbles obliquely, shatters as old metal oxidized in salt breezes. Winter winds of an ocean gone mad tearing it asunder, green, rusting shards fall without sound, sand-encrusted memories at my feet. My serenity tattered, frayed by inner doubts of myself, hope, future, anything of truth or value. Fearing myself lost, needing to be found. Standing adrift in shifting dunes, despair spilling about me, so much finite soil, dusted pain blinding me to the beauty that we could be. Hearing echoes of your voice whipped away by the distance, left in a flurry, in a swirl at the bottom of my sinking heart.

      Are you my fairy tale? Can you be That lie never told, That trust never broken, That hope never let down? Can I have faith With a crucified heart, A fallen soul, A spirit that fades? So afraid to believe In the impossible. And what Would you have of me? Passing lover? Water sylph? Lady wife? Partner in life? Do you see me? Or just what you want Me to be? Soft serenade In how you touch, Intensity of gaze. Braille fails me As I touch your body. I've no legend For the map of us. Traveling in circles, North star beyond vision.

      Wandering through the forest, My thoughts have gone astray. I smell blood. It is me. My heart has been Ripped Out of my chest. The wound hangs open raggedly; Blood drips to the leaves Forming puddles of life. Something stirs in the trees. I raise my head To behold you before me. You stand, Naked, My heart in your hand. I watch As you smear my heart Across the sky, My life's blood Continuing to flow from the valves, The red warmth falling, Like rain, Upon the woods, Upon me, In my eyes. I see my pain, My anger, In this red haze. With a snarl, I leap. My teeth sink into your throat As your hands grasp my fur to you. For you know That I cannot live When your hand ceases To guide my bleeding heart.  In the forest, Side by side, We three lay. Wolf-woman, man, and death.

      I am a blinding conflict of sorrow A heart-wrenching contradiction in pain Part of me begs to be seduced To feel Just for one moment That I am loved Truly That I am cared for That I haven't lost All that mattered to me All that I am Was Or ever will be That I haven't lived this life in vain  Yet here I stand Looking at those I have hurt These bright lights Misting through my life Diaphanous laughter touching my heart Lifting me for the moment Then gone Tentative contact destroyed Passing out of my now Choked by needful fears That swallow me whole Spit me out Leave me in the all alone. I am sorry.

      This shrew is not in need of taming. I am not your bitch in heat, your territory to mark. Do not fight my dragons, Do not climb these castle walls, Do not speak to me For the swell of my breast, Nor seek me out To divide what you hope Are willing thighs. Lay not a kiss upon this rosy cheek For I am saving myself.  I shall knight my own cause, Tell my own tale, And sing my own praises, As I serenade the world With who I have become. I am the warrior, the fighter, the survivor; I wait no longer to be saved by you... It is my heart you would break, My hope you would forsake. I have become my own hero. I will not be your Ophelia's End.

      Reach for me -- I'll deny you not. Can you feel my tender thoughts, Hear my deepest desires for you? Any other man's words would leave me empty, Ringing hollow in the starless night. Dear heart, know my mind, Let me touch you once again, Each intake of breath, a taste of you; Every whispered breeze delivering my message, Bringing to you memories of me Rich with my love, my adoration for you. If two souls should merge so completely as one, Could they not be our own two lights, to Kill the ember of a pale sun, to shine as one? Take me within your rugged embrace and Whisper to me of your gentle-violent passions, for Ours is tonight, ours is tomorrow, ours is forever.

      I wake from slumber, Slight breeze of fan Wrestling that relief From weary body, And in this silence, When troubles are lifted But for a moment From ever occupied mind I feel it. Your lips on mine. So many months Have gone by, And here you are. In my room, In my arms, Your breath warm Against my cheek, And I live in that moment Once again, Heart leaping as it did then. And just as quickly, It breaks. Because you are not there. It is memory, Nothing more, That leaves face wet, Chest heaving, Unable to breath. I am without you. And I have forgotten how to be. Me. Alone. In the silence. Wanting so much To make it all different, Take back that moment, My body against yours, And make it last forever.

      True blue, they call me. Truly blue, I say. Gathering bits of memory on the wind, Piecing it together, Forming a tattered tapestry, This fragile shape of my heart. Here where a brother dies And I am shattered. So much frail glass Cobbled together again, Leaving me in need Of the tie that binds. Frayed edges Loosened by uncaring hands. Child molesters are the moth-eaten holes In this blanket of my soul. And these threads, These threads that unweave themselves, The fractured remnants of my insane mother. How they tug and pull to unbind me, Leave me less than complete.  Gently I unfold me, Shake loose the dusting of pain. Slowly I mend, Clip away the strings of my mother, Sewing a stronger weave, One of my own making. A patchwork of new memories To erase moth tracks And bind my edges With my own caring hand. Alas, unable to reverse a death, I try to rinse the blood of his loss From my fabric, But the stain remains, Faded, always there. Always a part of me. I am left Only to find the warmth, The comfort in what I have become. I am worn. I am weary. I am complete.

      Sunflowers standing in complacent rows Green arms tickle and touch Slender stalk of kith and kin Swaying to music Of bee buzz and bird chirrup Seeded with memories... Each poignant, pointed thought Salted wistfulness Waiting to bite tongue and heart Swirl and line of each seed Imprinted as laughter and tears, Sun-laden droplets turned, Face-first, into summer breeze, Nodding in recollection to themselves Before they bow their heads To the coming fall, Autumn, And slumber once more, To dream of next season, come anew.

      I sit inside Of a One-way mirror Picture box. I may look Out, But those who try To look in See only My physical form And themselves Reflected in my eyes. When I try To break away From this Constricting closure, To show my inner self, To live, To love, The box distorts what I sense And I see others laughingâ€¦. Laughing at my efforts, Snickering to one another, Pointing. For all they see is a travesty Of human life, An unreal joke Being told in serious tones.  So I Build another box To surround me--- To protect me From themâ€¦. And from myself. Now, when they laugh, It bounces off. And when I try To get out, All that escapes My boxes Is a clown. At times sad, At others, funny.  But I didn't build A sturdy box. Sometimes I leak out Or their laughter seeps in. And I can't build a new box Because if I do I will suffocate And die, Leaving behindâ€¦. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only....  The Picture Box.

      These places Inside of Outside of Me My writing Our words Mistakes Happy errors Dancing lingual tangos In smoke-filled rooms Coffee-swilling shacks Trying to be writers Coming off as hacks But who knows? Listening to a beatnik beat Black clothes and darker moods Looking for inner meaning Eating cafe foods Ending as would-be authors Beer-belly budgets And broken dreams While I'm young, in this now I'll feed on the words Let my audience decide I've always looked good In tar and feathers As, out of town, On a railroad post I ride.

      Sitting here Thinking of you Sorting papers Taking calls And wondering If it's possible To build a bridge From my desk to yours Out of nothing but paperclips Oval longing These metal hands Gripping data And my imagination One and the same I can hear you Your voice a light timbre Of pleasure Making work a jumble of noise Nothing I can concentrate on Glancing at the clock Filing and re-filing  The Same Damned  Folder Crossing and re-crossing My legs Thinking.. Knowing... Coffee breaks Just aren't long enough And xerox machines Just aren't loud enough To cover my screams Your moans Our joy One desire And I add another paperclip.

I am in you, a part of you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as sheets of desire &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leave us shaking, &nbsp; &nbsp; dripping &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with hot dew upon our lips &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the wild aroma &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of nettle-musk &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seeping into our souls -- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; promises of moonlit rapture, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two bodies as one &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pressed upon forest floors &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dappled in silver shadows.

Light under the door Spills in on my life I wish I was with you -- My heart is torn by this strife.

      My friends, my co-workers, we women, joking, just as bad as any men's locker room. I, with my "Hand just doesn't send me flowers like it used to," followed by titters and groans whilst I chuckle at myself, realizing that for all I have laughed at so many men who have put name to body parts, theirs, or my own, (must it ALWAYS be junior?) I acknowledge my own silly guilt in such anthropomorphism, having found myself on too many a night calling out your name, imagining it is you, your touch, your passion, your love that drives me to distraction. But it is not.  My hand does not cause me to wonder what's on its mind, what happens in its life, what makes it happy or sad, nor make me want to be a part in that, whether cause or cure. I do not love my hand. I do not miss my hand. I do not need my hand. Not like I love you. Not like I miss you. Not like I need you. Not like that.  My hand is not you. Nor was he. And giving name to his needs did me no better than giving your name to my hand. Futile gestures to silence this body, this mind, this heart that cries out in the night and waits...  for you.  This joke just isn't funny anymore.

      I raise my eyes To the vision Of so many friends, Strangers, Men, all of them, With children at their sides Or clasped in their loving arms. Doting fathers, Tender love Softening the stern, Masculine facades, Crumbling the iron hearts, Igniting the Soul-paternal. Is this not reason enough To give birth On an increasingly-crowded Mother Earth? My rational mind Struggles With an eternally-maternal soul, With a womb That aches to carry life, With a heart That could love a nation Of children, Of hope, Of desires to be fulfilled. To give birth, To carry a part Of him-that-I-love, Just to see that look On his face As he gazes Upon our child, Our love.....  And even in this I have not spoken Of my own &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inner &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desire, To feel the weight Of a life Within my life, That which haunts my dreams And teases upon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my consciousness.........  But, alas, I cannot, Will not, Allow the fulfillment Of such a quest, For there  is the future to think about, Is there not? &nbsp; ....Yet... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what is a child.... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if not... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our future.

      Fearing that loss...  fearing to touch that which you have sought... to have it evaporate.. so much mist, leaving dampness on the cheek, sorrow in the heart...  and feeling the fool for believing, this once, this one time... that this would be different... that that person... that person you know... living inside your heart... your whole life you have known this person... Never caught sight of their face.. but in a dream.. and only briefly.. so you wake in sorrow... sweet pain.. knowing yourself so close... but ever too far away.. and believing this person does not, could not exist. Not in this lifetime. Not in this reference. Coming to believe it just wasn't ever meant to be. That this person, if they do exist in this now... in this time... is somewhere... in Africa... sitting in a hut... doing God knows what... speaking a different language... and you shall never meet... just continuing to touch phantoms... and watching them break your heart.. bury your faith... that laughs at you in your dreams... every time you miss seeing the face... of that person you never quite see, full on. Your other.

      When sorry is never enough To erase the pain To amend the mistakes Wrought by youth By foolishness By fears To bridge the gap In understanding Things not said Feelings not expressed Actions taken In heated moments Or extended silences Even Simply Gestures not made Words not heard For these things Are friendships lost And hearts broken For all of these things Have I laid a rift between us Brought sorrow where none Was ever Deserved And so I watch you walk away With my regret in your step Knowing that you are lost to me Because you cared More than I knew And I hurt too quickly Curled into myself And shut you out I cannot ask you to forgive Where I have not earned it Simply stated I tell you It You What was us Always  Mattered

      In the night A girl walks the streets She's a runaway reject Selling herself to any she meets  In her is a crystal heart A piece of which breaks away -- Erosion of the soul -- Each and every day  None who care None to love She's dying slowly The death of a wounded dove  Shooting crystal Snorting cocaine No feeling No pain  Incestuous father Forced her to run Now she doesn't care About what he's done  She's picked up the phone She doesn't wanna' roam -- "Daddy, this is Nicky... Can I come home?"  Daddy doesn't want her, Momma don't care. She's on the run again Nobody knows how she'll fare.  Nicky sits in a hotel bed Some stranger sleeps at her side. A razor is in her hands -- It was a bloody death that she died.  The police said it was suicide. The truth was that she was killed. Rejection and malice raised the blade -- No killer could be as skilled.

      Starlight, My body limned in sorrow. Gazing Into the velvet gown Of night's soft brocade, I am Wrapped In my regrets, Scented By my desire For that Which has yet to be And trapped, Caught Between the twilight of hope And the forever slumber Of what has been. Whispered prayers, A manna of desperation Slips From tear-stained Lips, Begging life For what I Would have of it, Moaning, And mourning, Knowing It will always be What life Would have of me.   Sun slips Moon From her tangled skirts. As I turn my eyes From such heated passion, I have been blinded To my own path.

      I know, now Why I don't sleep What keeps my mind From the darkness of rest Til exhaustion Bleeds me Feeds upon me Takes simple thought Sends it sobbing into the night Out of reach And lost to simple unconscience I know, now Why I don't weep Without you on my mind You changed me Loved me And then forgot it all In silence of night Echoing with hollow shout Of soul torn in two I hear you And know you aren't there Just one more laugh One more murmur One more anything Lying to myself To hold on Keep breathing Despite myself Hiding what you have made of me From all of them Dying With each beat of heart That shoves me forward Makes me live another day Static White noise In the empty curve of skull Shadow under eyes Sorrow under tongue Ululation of loss

      I see you I hear you I love you  You  Thinking of them Of others Always Over your own needs As she fades, And looks to you, Holding on Fearful, desperate grip On life On what she knows Afraid to let go Afraid to stay And you tend To what she cannot Embodiment Of her wishes  Lifting your eyes To the faces Their faces Her care-takers You honor them For what they have done Struggling With what is best for her 'Gainst what is needful For them Fret yourself Over fair Over right Over honor  How your heart It cringes And aches At things You'd rather not face Losses You'd rather not take Decisions You'd rather not make Yet you do it For her For them For everybody But you  And Life, Ever self-bemused, Deems this not enough For even in heart of hearts In home and hearth Where breath is to be drawn And slip free 'Tween tender lips Gentled by passion By the ease Coming home Is meant to be Soft touch to brow Loving caress To lift the burden To speak of love Commitment Of heart Of hope.  Not even here Not even now Surcease of grief Nor tensions subside Here is yet one more For whom you forget yourself Bound in honor Yet again Mindful of her Who has forgotten her vow Left you To stand alone In your moment of need.  I see you I hear you I love you I know  You  I know.

      Bright hopes dashed on bitter sorrows, Life's expectations nothing more than a whisper One that touches the back of the mind, Leaves it wandering, Wondering at that moment, That sound that was just a fragment, A memory, A forgotten dream That you ache for, Reach for, Wanting it back -- And it leaves you Stranded, alone, deaf to it all. It becomes you. You are consumed, Having served no purpose, But to echo the wind.

      Torn by dual natures Howling into the ocean waves And surfing through wooded valleys I am a creature of the wild A force of nature that mother earth Had made no allowance... no plan for Lifted from a watery embrace Into the cool night air Moonshadow drifting down To kiss my brow Beaded with the dew of a thousand seaside deaths Clothed by oceantide Giving voice to riptide I am a contradiction unto myself A blossom, a deadly bloom A moonflower scented with saltwater sorrows.

      He whispers my name Caresses it with his mouth Tasting it As if tasting of me And I am found  Lost these many years Of a broken heart Of a life lost Of a shattered hope Of love disbelieved  How many years Have I heard his voice? Felt his gentle touch? Turned to his arms, And found a phantom? His ghost stalking my now And eluding my forever?  Finally, Finally have I found him His breath on my cheek As I turn to him Deft fingers at my neck Guiding me to him Enfolding me in love  I am, He is, At last, Home.

      First kiss First embrace Drawing closer Too far away Thinking of you Wanting all of you Knowing your heart Is in my every now Knowing only your gentle words Tender humor, lifting me up Takes me from myself Makes me something new Something I've seen Only by means of you  Sunsets defined by your voice Moonrise contained within your love All that I see Shadowed by all that you are Limned in textures of passionate thoughts You are the sweet taste on my lips The name that breathes forth From the heart of me As I wake in the night Reaching for you, finding you gone And waiting, ever waiting For a finite forever To pass me by, Put me in your arms

      Sucking in each breath, Drawing it in deeper, Filling my lungs, My spirit, My heart With this primal effort This tormented pain, This out of my mind, destroying my body, Shredding my soul, and shrieking my delight, Orgasmic, banshee-shrill of a scream! Blown All To Hell 'cause I sneezed.

      Such a fleeting thing  This grasp I have  On life  On focus  On what it is  That I want  For me  Of you  To be  I am overwhelmed  Consumed  By the sheer power  Of all of it  All that I want  All that I can be  For myself  For you  For now  Forever  And yet I lose it  Just a momentary thing  Slip of breath  Between parted lips  Shredded desire  Beyond my reach  And I am rendered  Powerless  Hopeless  Floating  Aimless  And waiting  For that moment  To come again   Give me heart  Shape  Dimension  Endless, infinite  Dreamless  Find me  Shape me  Mold me  Hold me  And remember  To see  What it is  We could..  Are meant..  To be.

      Screaming out in terror, I wake from a nightmare. You hold me through the night And I know that you care.  You protect me From my fears, You kiss away The threatening tears.  People call you cold And they condemn you. They'll never know What is false and what is true.  I call you lover in the night, And friend by daylight.  Come with me; Forget their hate. Know my love And your passions I will sate.

      These random people See them going by Sitting at crossing gates Waiting for the trains to go by Knew about them, anyway My father Working for the railroad Stories of people in cars Blankets Refuse and defacation left  Like mice leaving insignia Wondering at their lives What they were before What they see Seeing me Do they see what they were? What they would be, again? Do they care? Or just thinking of next meal Next hearth Next home Next starlit night That doesn't freeze to the bone Just keeping low to the tracks And riding it out What life has done to them.

      It seems we spend so much of our lives Gathering sorrows like so many photos in an album This, this is where we slept back to back The space of too many silences between us And here is where despair set in Remember? It's like we can look at when and where It all began (Or shall we say ended) Yet, like the photos, All we can do is look and remember We remain helpless to change that which has passed  I think I must have become so drunk On those first bitter-sweet months The shy passions and delicate offerings We shared in the attempts to learn one another Even the petty fights to establish that we cared But above all, the constant companionship The desire to be with one another over all else. How do you get such things back? How do you pull the reality of the picture Into the confusion of now? I have forgotten myself I do not know how to be alone anymore I choke on stupid anger and tears And I blame you for my loneliness I am no more alone in your absence now Than I ever was in the solitude I once lived  Yet still I feel the resentment for the change. I look to every moment that might be shared Wanting you to want it as much as I Or as much as you once did. And I curl into myself to push you away, Every time you leave me a small betrayal Every friend that calls to your now And wins. Even the silence has its hold on you, Beckoning you into the night to escape From life From hurt And even, I fear, from me. And I stand here with my heart in my hand Trying not to hurt you as my hand harshly crushes  Every step you take towards time away A beat less in my palm for the pulp that remains I am no more alone now than ever For you have taught me what it truly is And it hurts and I blame you, me, my brother For leaving You come back from the night And I am losing you Every day I wait for your return And I watch you walk out the door Called by family Called by friends Called by yourself And you return to sleep   There was a day when you would stay awake Simply because I was there. Now you wait to see if the phone will ring Waiting for word that they will come to you And you anticipate their arrival You look forward to talking into the night And when the phone rings to let you down To turn you away You return to your slumber And I, I return to my Alone Spent listening to you snore While I wonder if I shouldn't have loved you from afar Loved you as a friend So that I, too, might be anticipated And spoken with into the night. Being a constant is to be in sorrow I feel that I cannot give enough And find myself withdrawing all the more Tied up in disappointing As I am disappointed.   It is a game I do not know how to play That of bribery.   I know others did more to keep your attention, Thought of what they could do to entice you  And I, I find that I push you away For every step you take there yourself   The more I am left to the Alone The more I am learning once again to embrace it. And I don't know how to make you understand Make it matter Make it change  I always come back to wanting to live my life As if we had not been joined To live single as it seems you still must in too many ways that hurt And let you want for my presence as I am always Wanting for yours.

      My heart just Hit the floor. I can't Fool myself anymore. It seems I might've dared To think That you might've cared. By this window You did pass As I stood waiting For my class. I made an effort To catch your eye.... The way you avoided me Made me want to die. Finally, it seemed, you could No longer hide, Pretending to look at someone By my side. I gathered my courage And developed a smile While you looked at me With dead denial. I mouthed "Hi..." You responded in like With something akin to "Take a hike." As you passed from my view I felt suddenly alone, Unsure what to do. I never meant To bother you.... Don't turn from me, And don't look away. I'll promise to love you If you'll only stay.

      You cheated On my heart Our vows Your promises Our love Marriage Was a convenience to you Maid service And a blow job In one You were as faithful to me In your attention As you were faithful To being a man Rage, resentment A coiled ball of self-pity Swallowing me down Using me to stay afloat Stepping on my dignity And shattering my faith I should thank you For the scars On my spirit They remind me Of who I never want to be Again

      Never having known A feeling like this, Meeting you now, needing you Ages before sharing one word Suddenly, it all makes sense, This waiting, this wandering Everything locking in Marking you, my completion, Innocent to pure love until us Kindred, I know you now. Eager and patient, I await.

To be me, Loved by you.

With the wolf With the beasts of shadow and stealth A child's sleep upon your brow And a child's dreams held near your heart Tomorrow's light brings grief's dread dirge Hold on, Child, to such tender youth And Howl, Howl Child! Warn them. You are hope, And you draw nigh with ivory fang The truth sung upon your lips Let them cower in their fear full age For they know what was, what could be. They know YOU, Child. And no matter else, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; always,   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Howl, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HOWL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Child!

       Fell to his knees  "I'm begging you."   Turned deaf ear to his pleas  "I'm leaving you."   Cried out her name  "wife, I love you so"   To her it was the same  "I don't, and so I go"   Sobs wrack his form  "I'm sorry.. don't hate me."   Nothing out of the norm  "You forget, there's no we."   His heart shatters in two  "Forgive me, love me once more!"   There was nothing she could do  "Get up off the floor."   He reaches out a trembling hand  "I've loved you since day one."   She hears his hope fall, strike land  "My heart broke.  We're over.  Done."   He turns away, curls into a ball  "All I ever wanted was you.."   Doesn't see her tears start to fall  "I never mattered.  We're through."

      Be still my frozen heart. You have yet to earn the right &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of passage Into the realm of human emotion. At times, late at night, When his face haunts my dreams, I think I hear you coming, The delicate thud-thump of your steps Into the cavern of my soul. Then a choked sob escapes From rebellious lips, Making your presence But a whisper. It seems you've begun to thaw Behind the walls I built so carefully Over the years. The dew that gathers on my breast Can have no other origin... It's merely the melted ice Backing up in faulty plumbing, Blurring uncertain vision. Nothing is as it seems. I know, I know. Tis I who have caused your rebirth. I thought it safe to reach out, To touch the flame of another life's light... I'd forgotten the searing pain, The dangers of wanting, of caring. I'd believed you too far gone In your icy haven To ever be touched again. But you see, it is as I said before. At times, late at night, His face haunts my dreams.

      Finally, I have come to see it. I am a novelty. From afar, And so new, I fascinate, Amuse, Entice, Delight. Given time, Exposure, And the distractions of life, I am reduced, Faded in color, Not quite enough. No better Than a 25 cent toy, Waiting for drop of coin, Spin of gear, Delivered Into the hands Of this eager child Known as man. Only To be broken And discarded, Wanted No more. So here I sit And wait. For word from the child That I, As toy, Saw from afar. So new, I was fascinated, Amused, Enticed, Delighted. Given time, Exposure, And the distractions of life, He became larger than life. He stole The heart of me. Waiting, Knowing, Hurting, Dreading his final decision. This one time. To be discarded no more.

      Now, knowing he shares with another What once he gave to me, To my heart, It is a slow death, A choking death. I can see him now Looking into her unknown face, Touching her as he once touched me, Holding her in his arms Pressing with tender lips, Gently probing with sensitive tongue. I can see all of this, Knowing how much more it hurts, Knowing that he could turn from my arms Into those of another In the breadth of a heartbeat, Our grave yet warm to the touch. I knew he never loved me, Yet for the sake of friendship, I would that I had mattered more, Mattered at all, So that the passing of my life through his Might cause him to pause As he reaches to stroke her hair (As he did mine) And think of meâ€¦. And know what he's done. And for an instant, Just an instant, Know what he has lost, feel what he has lost, By loosing me.

      You have turned to me Just as I have turned to you We have met eye to eye Soul to soul Knowing ourselves afraid Yet we do this We reach out Fingertips barely brushing Thoughts reaching out Whispering to one another Like children tucked in 'fore night's fall And we risk it. Risk the hurt the pain the shame. That demon called Alone Because we see. We see each other And we know Kindred Other Mate Love Potential Forever Embraced Locked in 'til the end, 'til we see this through, And know it for what it is. Know US for what we are. At long last. Complete.

      This is where I tell you Not to look at me again Where I tell you Not to beg of me again Not to vent Your spleen In my heart Bleed me out Feed me out Weed me out Of your life Forget how I felt In your bed On your body Against your lips  Breath &nbsp &nbsp of my perfume  This is where I tell you No more do I adore Where I tell you To hell with you Where I say Do I love you And do I forgive you And do I miss you  NO MORE  This is my I will survive I am woman Hear me roar Boots were made For walking All Over You  Sonata  And I ask you Do you hear me DO YOU hear me DO YOU HEAR ME  NOW!?  Because This is where it starts And THIS is where it starts And THIS is where it STARTS AND THIS   Is where it ends.

      I have no path I float lifelessly Within a lifeless job, Greeting faceless, endless Grocery carts, Checks, Cash, WICS, Rarely truly acknowledging a customer Or a voice. I am as guilty Of the crime that victimizes me, Lays me bare And exposes me for the statistic I am. I file away the carts Like another failed dream And am pulled up short By the outstretched hand of malice, Insanity In the blood-shot eyes of a regular. He pulls me aside, Whispers of judges and bars and fast-food joints, Placing his expulsions upon my representative shoulders With a presumptuous hand of familiarity Explaining with an apologetic voice Why he refrains From courting those of us he has raped With a word or a look, And I stand there all the while, Stunned by the hilarity of it, The grotesque joke he hands to me An offering of repulsion, And I grasp it to me in secret, Back to my sister cashier to reveal the burden, So that between us the horror shall be twained By the meeting of our eyes And our desperate sighs As we displace another violation In the wiping of tired hands on soiled aprons. The bright glare of the store lighting Clarifies the atrocity, Chases away all hope of redemption from this new burden, Leaves us to empty carts in the silence.

      You found me. Adrift on a sea of words, Pouring my goodbyes into the waters, And you gave me cause, Reason, To stay, floating, Tranquility, Reaching out with compassion, Recognition. And for all I was deaf, With emotions, With the din of so many voices, Tugging at my heart, Rending my soul, You, I heard. You I reached back for. Your hand offered up, In friendship, In understanding. And we shared whispers, Tendrils of thought, Of life.  Yet you reached out again. To offer aid, comfort, yourself. And I, behind these walls of doubt, I was touched by you.  Now we reach out to each other. I have opened myself to you, Spreading wide as a lotus in bloom, Bearing forth a heady aroma of desire To be scented, seeded, by you, Your thoughts, your ardor... You came into me, Spilling out the knowledge of your ancestors, The potential of your descendents, And the wealth of your love. Now here we lie, coiled one 'round the other. You still deep within me, both body and spirit, While we share our momentary, fleeting truths, All else a somnolent buzz, And I find I drift no more, Having found my peace in you.

      Seeing you in my mind's eye.. Taking flight on winter's wing.. Eyes downcast in thought.. Curve of mouth lifting, pleased Knowing I exist in you Just as you breathe in me.. Feeling that distance growing Even as I am drawn closer to you On this eve of Christ's birth Aware that I'd sacrifice it all Give up all that I have  To become all that we can be Together Tonight And in every tomorrow that we will have Between us Before us Stretching out with such promise Our love Our future Our fate Intertwined Souls enmeshed Indivisible Never again Shall we walk this path alone You and I Never again Apart But complete.

      The steps we take in life Those first toddling ones Reaching out for support For a hand, Mother's hand to assure Later in life Those steps That carry us into school To our first date Our first homes Into hospital rooms full of death Steps into becoming ourselves But the steps that follow me The steps I hear an echo behind A lifetime away Are the steps of the one That one that haunts us all The one we lose faith in Refuse to believe in After too many steps alone Searching And never finding The one The one who makes us whole As we make them whole That perfect other That love Looking for that day When these weary travels are no more And Namaste becomes greeting and end We are found.

      Breathless promises Made in a passionate moment, Whispering Of hopeless dreams, Offering the world, Holding on to the moment -- Never wanting it to end, Knowing it will, Memorizing each caress, Every passing kiss Placed upon a downy breast, A diamond tear shed For the knowledge that such ardor, Such unforgiving bliss, Shall turn to the dust Of an oft recalled memory. Hurting at the same time As ecstasy lifts you Upon a sparkling wave of sensations, Gathering him to your soul Knowing he'll leave his mark, The impression of tender lips, Or gentle words, Taking just a little too much, Leaving just a little too little. But you do it, Giving all you have, Knowing all too well, Loving for the moment.

      Sometimes When he doesn't know I stare at his face The tender curves That sway with his thoughts Dark lashes, Dark eyes At moments like these He touches me deeper than most Knowing he can turn that gaze on me An intensity I never knew Never thought I'd feel. He tries so hard Too hard And pushes me away My deliberate lover Male, direct in desire Touch my heart Stir my mind Speak to my soul, love My body already knows.

      How do people forget? So simple As blocking childhood memory? Amnesia by choice Emotions inherent Imperative All consuming Overwhelm Defined And underlined Yet they forget Forget love Forget scent Forget touch And taste How sweetly kissed Body arc Cry and moan Delight All at their command Demand Desire And yet They forget How do they do it? Once learned Once taught that..   That skill That drill That manner In demeanor   Thatâ€¦.   Thatâ€¦.    I would rather forget.

      Confection of my heart Sweet taste of you Lingers On my tongue A memory of saccharine delights Your touch on my flesh Your breath, warm against my lips Scent of you Heats the fires of my spirit Aromatic passion The nectar of your memory Nestled within every breath I take Longing for the harvest To reap what we have sown A garden formed by love The hanging vines of your words Dripping so dear Into hungry ears A cornucopia of emotions This feast of each other Waiting only For dinner bell to ring

      What we become at heart As we weather yet another love Another friendship Curled as balls of fur Of blunted claw Of wilting whisker Waiting for heat of fire To warm To bring to us What is but faded memory What we remember Of hunt Of capture Of what we once were Lithe in muscle and limb Seeking mate Prey Life Twitch of eye To what life has to offer But no more Simply coiled And curled In upon ourselves Purring Fond of memory Of what was And of what we never caught Ninth life bled out As sigh And settling Of fur To slumber

      I'm finding the way Back into this life Into these memories That I'd shed for brighter days For warm hopes Into this life I'd shrugged free of so long ago I've gathered my wits, My sadness, My wanderlust, and my quiet moments And I've shed the truth of what I have become, What I have ever been, Onto this last whisper of the child Who has forgotten to laugh, Who has forgotten to be free. At long last I've found the way, the way into being me.

      Every breath taken And expelled With yet another year passed Another moment lost Yet to achieve dream Achieve hope Achieve any semblance Of what would be deemed goal Yet I breathe on Taking flight On broken wing I am call of lark Sorrow of loon Seeking nest Seeking lake Seeking choice And hope Alighting Just in time To see myself too late Flock moved on Every flap of wing And feather lost Whimsy and murmur Of the flight Of my life's desires.

      Cut loose these strings That have bound us By our mutual mistakes Loneliness  Causing a hand outstretched A whisper in the dark A passion that should never Have been shared To appease and please Fill in Where sorrow had tread  A moment too long A silence too loud An aching heart That bled too red Thanking you For what passed  Between And now Beyond  Let it have its rest A grave untouched A tear unshed Let it be said That we have forgiven Gifted And no more Spirits set free Better for meeting Better off for letting go. Friends at one time, Friends once more, And nothing further.

      Shadow of my heart In whispered confusion Do you conspire against me Yammering at me  Of things desired Yet out of reach I know not  What to make of you What you do to me Where you lead me What I truly want Knowing only Of the absence Of the empty inside Waiting to be filled A need knowing no end Waiting for him For that touch That sound of voice That comfort of solace Brought to me But in bits and pieces Of time meted out In gaps of gasp and sorrow Trying to understand  What has become of me What is truth, anymore What is before me What I should seek Just knowing I have yet To arrive.

      These gawdy harlots Dancing their chiming ballet Giddy on lifeblood Of we hopless, we hapless Many Choking on glee As we suffer and quake Spun and spent On thread of their whims As they string us about on    Lyre Harp Desire Showing us what we would With these oh-so small lives Wicked fang agleam Painted faces leer And we are pulled up Short On lead and leash Of their pantomime Our hope Their comedy and drama No more, no less, no fate But what they weave of us.

      The first time is supposed to be A very special time. It should be With someone you love. It should be With someone you trust.  I suppose my first time Was special in its own way. It was unique. The one who gave me My first time Is the only one I've ever had "time" with. I guess that means I should be proud. Proud to say that there's only been one.  I guess you could say My first time Was with someone I loved. At least I loved him at the time. I looked up to him. He was the knight Who would oppose all of my dragons.  And I trusted him. Only to be betrayed. You see, My first time Was very unique. It was with A knight In rusted, molding armor. And it was when I, The fair maiden, Was but a fair child. In human years I was a middle-aged cat Who got her fur rubbed The wrong way. I was no where near Coming into heat.  Yet I loved this fallen knight. With a brotherly love. For that's what it was. Special, brotherly love Any child would have. For a brother. I think I'd rather Face my dragons and die Than to face life... After my first time... With my brother.

      The feel of your hand on my leg, tentative touch, gentle, inquisitive, longing Our eyes meeting, knowing, feeling, loving, in this, our first encounter Knowing myself swept into the arms of your gaze, awash with curiosity, with desire My lips still burning, tingling from the memory of first kiss,  Waiting for your mouth to speak passion, taste of love And so I am led by you, my hand in yours, towards desert night,  To a bed of our making, a nesting of our two hearts I am struck with waves of ecstasy, joy contained in your touch,  Your heated whisper coiling in my ear, and I hunger for you anew Flesh sliding, gliding over flesh, turgid, soft, supple and sure,  I am drowning in you, having no need to survive I have surrendered to your verdict, this edict to love you,  And forever be reborn in the baptism of your caress,  Your passing looks, the defintion of my soul. You, my release, my parole, my reward, my freedom,  Forever have I awaited you, and now, forever,  Shall I drift in your promise, you, my ocean. And so am I quenched in you, needing no more than this,  These moments we share, these lovers we are, this beauty that is us,  This love like no other, complete.

      Indigenous beer bottle gravesite outside Unable to bury the truth Of dark native eyes Or lithe brown arms Nor in black, curling hair And ivory teeth grin Familial love In a roomful of strangers Bound by blood By dust in the creased seams Of weathered smiles And warm ancestral hearts Adobe walls Echo with Bingo shout And dime store glee My lover at my side We feed on BBQ And each other Our secret laughter And joy In glancing affection And momentary touch Found in rugged settings And simple company Ours Theirs And the holy faces Woven in tapestries That act as windbreak and shade To arid desert breeze  We drive by a book Spine against rock Open in hymnal To knowledge lost on ochre road And broken hopes Faded in pastel colors On the concrete bridge we cross, As Kokopeli dances his history Between swathes of graffiti And traces of red soil

      In twilight's fading light Moth dashes itself In ruin Against faded neon sign Striving for that beauty That flash of delicacy Such fragile wings cannot bear And I wonder at you Your own fragile self Butterfly wings Sodden with orchid tears Sorrows running so deep So true  To what you don't want to be That its shades are imbued in you Deep blues of mourning Scattered black ashen in your fluttering Streaks of yellow Like flashes of pain Runs throughout your pattern Your flight, your fall, your ascension You are a wonder of life A creature beyond comparison You are what most of us Would have of ourselves Yet your melody How it chains you Defines you Is a crime upon your soul When that same song How sweetly it has guided us, Those who flock to your bardic trill You are my dark angel My star in the night sky I would that I knew how To capture you And set you free Of yourself Your hurt Your walls Without taking away The beautiful dusting of your wings A memory of you Left in trace upon my hands.

Listening, Hearing that beat Echo  Off vaunted cave walls What you call your heart. Cold stone. Walk it alone.

      My spirit My soul Ever uneasy Never to rest Rising up A fiery bird Born from a pyre Of uncertainties Choking on the ashes Of what has been Consumed by flames of hope I am newborn. Passion and desire My colors, My calling. I pierce the night sky With my molten cry Dazzling the eyes Of the unlearned Those who've yet to understand I am the beginning I am the end I am fulfillment And completion I am what you have dreamed of But never believed in. I am what you would have of me. I am yours.

      That moment in pool of water As rain has passed us by Each drop Soft whisper Hint and clue To what we would know Just beyond serenity Beyond knowledge Beyond meaning And we wait Wait for that next storm Wait for that next drop That next torrent That sings of the now Of the future Of meaning to life Brushing tangled mass of hair From clouded view Reach for watery reflection For image of what is And lightning strikes Blinded To wait For that next rainbow And promise Of storm, of truth, of reason.

      The way my mind wraps around it all The colors, the scents, the sounds Taste, touch... This life I laugh aloud Thinking I understand it all WANTING to understand it all And not getting a bit of it It all spins by so fast A whirlwind A merry-go-round From a convoluted mind Too much And always not enough Spinning Spinning As a girl in a meadow As a teen in angst As the woman I am now Watching the stars above Feeling the soil below The wind at my throat And tangled in my hair And I wait for it This understanding And know myself lost In cognitive distortions

      Body language That's what I'm speaking, here Speech for the eyes Nothing fancy No peacock feathers Just a hip sway Tilt of chin Lifting lashes Tongue Running so lightly Over dew-frosted lips I am the Colorless Symbol Maker The heart breaker The taker  Of your desire Entrance you Enhance you  Draw you in And make you mine Seducing your soul With the glyph of my sigh And the cenotaph of my desire Breathe me in Know your death In my passion

      What shapes us Drapes us Breathes us in His whispered words Over soil and sand Formed in shadowed light New breeze over supple flesh Gifted yet ever cursed Free will our blessing Our end No control No design Desire, dismay An apple a day, and forever out of grace Waiting for moment to be forgiven Even as already forgiven Father calling us home Impatience in the fraction of a second Glance of an eye Eternity in the span of a sigh

      I remember walking on shells As that saying goes In my mother's household Her arguments with my father Her anger at us Her insanity And I wonder at what has changed I have left many marks in my path Bled my heart out A trail of tears A wake of laughter When all I really want All I've really needed Was to walk in love To find that other My other He who I would adore Who would lift me With sheer presence Knowing he was there For me  With me  Forever at my side To help me walk a new path Shining, sparkling Free of taint and sorrow One of sweet clarity To be laid out In crystal footprints

      Every time I get in the shower Go to bed Pick up a book Breathe in Breathe out Step in Step out Every time Ringing Off the hook Off the wall In my head Wishin' myself dead Gets to where  I can't think anymore Telemarketers Drive me nuts What ever happened To solicitors  At my door?

      These walls This heart This soul Seeing me in dew of passion On lip and lid Tress on curve of breast  And I sigh As I settle and sinew Twist and coil Passion enflames Denies And draws on Sweet song on tongue As tasted in kiss and moan Of that which you would have Could have Should have And is not But for the notion Of the motion Of the sweetness that is and is not Interpret the braille Of my siren And be drawn to my rocky shore

      I remember, As a kid, How the blankets Pulled over my head (With air hole Through which to breathe) Sufficed As monster repellant And fending off Those too active shadows.   Nowâ€¦ Now it has all changed. The monsters have gone, But these pesky aliens, With their abduction attempts, Are blanket resistant, With their static guard And lint eliminators. But Iâ€™ve figured them out. It seems a circle Of Mortonâ€™s finest salt, Poured with shaking hand In circle â€˜round bastion of bed, And air hole Converted Into firing shoot For steady stream Of soap bubbles of doom, Is quite more Than any xenotechnology Can handle. If only Iâ€™d figured it out sooner. Anybody out there Have cure For anal probes Or occipital lobe implants?

      Adrift in an ocean of clouds Turbulent winds Tugging at the plane Tearing at my heart The wind pulling me further from you My mind begging me to turn back Trying frantically to warn me To turn me aside From turning from you, Knowing it was the last thing I wanted to do. Running for the plane Running out of your life My actions were lying My feet betraying my heart Wanting to run back into your arms Into your love Into us. So I am shaken. By rough skies, By aching heart, By my love for you. And left wondering Wanting Waiting For the moment When life may whisper me In your ear, In front of your eyes, Into your arms again. How can each second take this long?

      My grandfather. Love. Sadness. Pain. Cantankerous old bastard. Shamelessly swearing To irk his son. Grumpily grouching at my ineptitude. But not real anger. I know this now As I knew it then. What neither of us said But always felt. I say it now, Grandfather. I have always, will always, love you. If only I'd said it before.  We were opposites In most every way. My liberal thoughts, Your conservative actions. I stand for animal rights. You never knew such existed. Given two pups You chose one (shot the other) And raised it with a heavy hand.  Yet I remember more. Your conversations In the bathroom With the soap and plunger, All to amuse Grandma and me. Peering at me Through thick lenses With a silent face. And eyes that said everything.  And when the pain Was at its worst, and life unbearable, still you fought to maintain the facade. You didn't hurt, You didn't care. But grandma knew better. As did I.  On the radio the DJ says, "Call in -- let me know what you want to hear" I want to hear you, Grandpa. But all I hear, all I see, Is my imagination.  My mind's eye Watches you creep painfully from the house; remaining dog romps at your side, your escort to a darkened grape arbor. I can hear you now. Raspy intake of breath, scrape of cane along picnic table's surface, placing thick spectacles next to your cane.  Dog's ears perk At the sound of shells sliding home. Old man hands pull back hammers. Forever hearing Report of silent death.  Your dog misses you, Grandpa. You took his lifeliness with you. He sits staring at nothing. The stupid, faithful mutt stayed at your side. Was there when they found you.  I understand That you hurt. I also understand that I hurt. Part of me is angry. At you for leaving, At me for things I never said. I fear your funeral. when they incinerate your shell.  Part of me will be burned. Even now I feel the aching heat. The scar will run deep. Eventually, slowly, the pain will fade. To leave behind The numbness, The emptiness, The alone. Can you hear me, Grandpa?

      Dance with me, My love... Call to me, Let me shatter As breaking waves On the shore of your desire. I want to live with you, And live within you, Know the shadow of your soul, Hear you echo In the chambers of my heart.  Give me wing, My love... Let me break free, Tethered here, So much chafing flesh Brought to heel At the hands of another. If belonging I must be, Let that longing Be with you...  As I would be with you, And no other. I know. 'Tis not fair, Teasing you thus and so With tender touch Brushed away By timber of his voice, Gentle kiss Suggested, Never given. Glancing looks Touching deeply, Yet not at all. I would gift you with me If only..  If  Only  You would be my key.

      Silence gathers in corners Wispy, unnoticed Creeping into the curves of the couch Pockets of quiet that shiver and turn in my wake As I pass from one thought to the next It coats all a somber color Creates shadows in my mind And I think of those Who sound no more Laughter that dies with a soft note Leaving such a familiar ache Tears that burn with a whisper Down pale faces And into the pools of my breaking heart I thought those sounds would carry on forever Forever comes too soon.

      Will I ever grow beyond this? Beyond the acts of childhood prostitution? Trading my body for time meted out in sessions at Barbie or moments of playing pretend, a play that grew wan and pale for similar such moments spent as nurse to doctor, hospitalized, paralyzed, a mannequin for experiments. I was my brother's own life-sized Barbie, allowing those attentions in trade, tendering my soul for the price of pretending he was just my brother, and cared.  So many years later, and his attentions matter not. Yet I sit peering at my toenails, painted by a friend, thinking of the paint on my face but days before, a makeover by yet another friend, and I wonder, what am I trying to make over? What does all this paint hide? It seems I am caught, trapped, behind Barbie's plastic smile, knowing not quite the perfect woman, never complete, something missing from the anatomy of me.  Because that moment came, that final awaited moment. A hand reached out, eyes met mine, and touched beyond this mask, beyond this plastic smile, saw me through it all and spoke to me in a language I'd never heard. He spoke of love and patience, handing me my body in trade for my heart. And I didn't get it. It was currency so rich, so fine, and yet so confusing. All that I had wanted in a lifetime of transactions, failing to understand this rate of exchange.  So.  Here I sit, staring at sea-green toenails, having bartered my body, compromised my heart, fed the passion of a friend to feed the bank I could comprehend, knowing myself robbed, having stolen it all from this gift, his gift, to me.  Filing for bankruptcy. This branch is closed for business. Learning, finally, to be a monopoly and speak his moneta.

      It's bed time And he's no where to be found It's bed time And his side of the bed is cold It's bed time And all I want is him The smell of him, The feel of him, Sense of him At hand It's bed time And I want to look into his eyes Hear his gentle voice Coil round my ear And into my heart Feel his hand touching mine His breath warm upon my cheek And know. Know that this will ever be. But it is bed time And he is anywhere But here.

      Do Not Do You Befriend me. Better that you greet me With thinly veiled conceit Than with gentle touch And kind words Carried by a voice Of compassion For I shall strangle you With my passionate embrace And fill you with dread Of the strength of my desires.  I am the puppy. I follow Where I shall surely end up Receiving kicks in place of kisses.  My resolve of love Would cause St. Valentine Himself To shudder and draw away.  Yet how I fear The definite signs Of true intentions, The key phrases, The gestures That say I, too, am loved. I seek the purest passion Yet I tremble at finding its depths. For this is my dream I fear the nightmare of drowning.... Of being submersed so fully That when the depths No longer have need of me My soul will fade, Leaving behind Only a shadow of grief.

      I am a whore of Babylon A slave to Eros I am the therapy Men seek out With wounded hearts in hand They bury themselves In my embrace Lose their grief As they lose themselves in me Crying out in passion, in pain Giving me their rutting sorrow And the passing illusion That it is me they love And when it ends, When they lift their sated souls From my open heart, From my open thighs, All wounds mended They gift their love to another Leaving my paltry broken hopes On the bedside table Sad payment For a debt with no end.

      Pregnant with sorrow These many months This babe Of our creation Mourning sickness That grips my heart Leaves stretch mark furrow Of tear tracks Down weary face Carrying this burden This part of you That fills me up Weighs me down Waiting for that morning To come That doesn't end In cold shower And sobs Coiled with me On tub floor Needing this water To break Before I do Feel spasm of birth In back and breasts  And having given This stillborn babe Into cold life air Wrenched with pain Of afterbirth Bereft Of you Of us Of our infancy Empty inside I labor no more.

      Mind in rebellion Battles with body Cares not for losses For casualties of war Back of fire Bending 'neath weight of sorrow Of tenacity Thoughts stand rampant Triumphant over wreckage Ruin That is spirit and form of me I win and I lose Tug of war Made up of sinew and sigh Laughter ringing no more Muscle bunch and heart clench I am set free And bound By a memory Of you Of what was And is No more I am sick inside My body yet another symptom Of loving  And letting go.

      These many years gone by Watching time slipping past And remembering those fragile moments Those fleeting flashes of joy Laughter like tiny shards of melodic glass Carried through winter winds As we played and carried on Building our igloos, throwing our snowballs Making angels in the snow Myriad lights that glimmered blue Sharp cold air whipping away our breath  We were children, you and I, Lost in the forever That our young minds created of those days Mittens and scarves binding hands and cheek Happiness wrapped 'round as Snug as any winter coat Knowing that we would have forever To be children, to be brother and sister Giggling as we endowed a snowwoman  And these many winters later Watching the snow drift down Icicles hanging low, the ivory teeth of my pain I look out and see the children See the snowmen The igloos The laughter and youth And I see them making their angels Through a haze of sorrow And I think of you And wonder Do angels cry, too?

For the Grace of God, you went. And now You are a light A laugh A tear for us all You are the child dancing in our hearts Bringing us to our knees Thanking God for what we had in you. And for the Grace of God, Kevin, For the Grace of God, our love.

      When I was born Twas a June day When first I breathed in  This life This reality Knew myself as more Than touch Hunger Sounds Mother's heart Cried out To know more And so many Junes So many days  That have passed me by And yet Here I am Crying out Wanting to know more Wanting sounds Hungering Touching For life For breath For a different sort of beat To play in my ear And not knowing what  What that sound is The heart of another The beat of my path The story of my life Just knowing That I am more Than just another June day

      Lying next to you in the night, I hearkened to the beat &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of your lionheart, Watched your chest rise and fall, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rise and fall With every breath you took. How many hours did I spend Just watching you live? Caressing your silky skin, Placing the smallness of my hand Within that of your man-hand, Knowing all along that I did it To know you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to memorize every part of youâ€¦â€¦ In my own way &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hoped my touch would enter your dreams Just as surely &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as you entered me that night. Your touch spoke for you, The timbre and tone of your caresses Every bit as deep as your voice, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just as tantalizing. That night, as we held each other, You asked if I was in love with you. I told you I didn't know. But I do know. I love you as my friend, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as my lover. If the two as one &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should mean that I love you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then there is no other answer, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no other truth. I remember the feel of you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; next to me in slumber, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; above and in me in love-making. Even now I can still smell you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the spicy, metallic tang of your body &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has been ingrained in my flesh. I can still taste you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; feel your lips upon mine, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your tongue a messenger of passion. Know that I am happy, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that our friendship, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our love-making, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is all I need of you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all I will ask of you, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until the time should come &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that you desire more of me. Know that what you have given me, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; being the first to be my lover, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has placed you as special in my heart, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in my memories. I'll not forget you, my love, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor our passionate friendship. Romance is not ours, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for romance is for books, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for fantasy. You, dearheart, are quite real.

      When Can I hear Bob Marley  And not be sad? Drown in Bjork Without drowning In tears? A sampling of music A sampling of you Gifted to me With love Taken from me By time And distance You tell me That it was all a lie Difficulty with attraction You said And I hold the poems That you wrote to me Hold them With disbelief This hollow sorrow Inside Knowing myself safe To finally let go Of you Of your lie But the truth of MY love For you Itâ€™s the lump in my throat The ache in my heart The soft moan When Bob Marley sings

						   Silence is never so loud as when it is shared.  Lying.. if they're strangers, they shouldn't matter enough to you to lie to them.  Little white lies to save their feelings, perhaps.. (No, Louie, you DON'T look like a serial killer), but not about life in general or in specific.  No point in it.  And if you know them, then they should matter enough NOT to lie to them.  Neh?  Games and manipulation.. much like the issue of lying.  Except I don't see any exception to this.  Be direct.  You only honor yourself, and whomever you speak with, if you are forthright and direct.  If something goes awry in communication, try try again.  But know that you aren't murking the waters with deception.  You waste your life, and time, much less theirs, in bothering with that.  Love.  I say this having been through more pain than I wish to discuss.. pain I don't wish to repeat.  Even knowing and feeling this.. I say to you, no love given or shown is wasted.  Even should the recipient act in opposition to my above thoughts.  Even should they hurt, neglect, or revile you, take advantage of you, abuse or dismiss you.  Love, when given or shown in truth, has not been wasted, because it is the beauty in you shining out.  Pity those that mistreat such gestures.  And love on.  Friends.  I cannot say this enough, and try on a daily basis to improve upon my own actions, having few I deem as close.  Know them for the treasures they are, and remind them that they are treasured.  We're all in the process of trying to be and do better things.  Not a one of us would succeed and persevere if it weren't for those that love us and support our efforts by presence alone.  Family.  They're yours, whether you want them or not.  Apply the above semantics, laugh a lot, and pray a lot, to whomever you pray.  I know some families are not blessings.. are, sometimes, even, a curse in too many sad instances.  So if nothing else, pray to survive them.  As mine prays to survive me, neh?

						   So.  I was still awake at 2 this morning, lying in bed, thinking about Otis Redding.  Or his songs, at least.  What?  Doesn't EVERYBODY find themselves awake in the wee hours with Otis Redding songs in their head?  Try A Little Tenderness was ringing in mine.  "Young girls do get weary, wearing that same old shaggy dress, yes.."  I'm about a month away from seeing about getting a reliable car.  And the behemoth I'm driving decides it's going to try and kill me before I can dispense with it.  Somebody said once that I should name it Morgan, a play on morgue, for a hearse or the kind of car mob hit men might drive.  I don't know that I perceive a Chrysler Fifth Avenue as mafia material, but I'd agree with the whole grim reaper aspect to the sucker.  The brakes went out.  Again.  After replacing the master cylinder.  (don't ask me, I barely get what that is, myself)  So she's trying to kill me, this metal monster.  I think I simply don't get along with machinery.  She resents that I'm replacing her.  And now my computer is trying to commit suicide.  It seems to be eating itself, insofar as memory space on the main hard drive goes.  I think, overall, it means I need to spend less time with the two of them.  Shed my shaggy metal dress, not let these malfunctions drag me down.  It's starting to be spring and summer out there.  Thinking about trying a little tenderness on myself, and seeing what goes on outside of the midnight hour.  I'll be going to the Shakespeare Festival in July, and will be taking my birthday off for the first time in years.  I'm taking a couple friends to see Spiderman 2 that day.  And then doing whatever else comes into my head to do.  Odd concept, that.  Doing whatever I want.  *sighs*  I do know that once my adversary is functional enough to actually STOP when I step on the brakes, Iâ€™m going to start taking drives out to the lake and other outlying areas and just go for walks.  Start breathing.  (I, btw, hated Waiting To Exhale.  A little overdone, for my tastes.  So Iâ€™m NOT waiting to exhale, folks.  This is more of an oxygenating, take it in deal)  And see what Otis has to say to me, then.

						   Okay, keep in mind I'm a Cancer, for whatever that means in the scheme of things.  So that title has more to do with that than my temper.  It seems Iâ€™ve become somewhat of an oracle or an advice columnist to friends and strangers alike.  Iâ€™ve got one stranger stalking me (yes, Iâ€™ve developed another stalkerâ€¦ itâ€™s like a rash that keeps coming back, but itches in different spots) with the obsessed belief that I can answer for the world, much less whatever troubles are in his life.  This guy doesnâ€™t even know what heâ€™s dealing with.  I weathered Danny.  This guy is small fries, comparatively speaking.  I just donâ€™t get how Iâ€™ve somehow become stalker bait, much less how people think I can give them direction in their lives when I canâ€™t put direction in my own.  Perhaps because itâ€™s easier for me to give advice with clear eyes for others than it is to follow my own advice.  So, between my own advice doing me no good, and my writing skills serving no purpose, Iâ€™m thinking I either need to start up working as exactly that.. an advice columnist.. or contact Hallmark and start creating greeting cards.  Make these useless skills (insofar as them serving any purpose for me) do something to benefit me.  Every once in a while I have a man ask me why Iâ€™m not already taken by somebody.  It seems to me the same could be asked of those that pose that question, but regardless, they seem to figure it out in the long run.  Iâ€™ve given up on seeing through the eyes of others, when it comes to what they see when looking at me.  Just helped one friend figure out he was being an idiot about a woman in his life.. ie, donâ€™t look a gift horse in the mouth, just saddle it and go.  Why people struggle against the chance for happiness when it comes their way, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever understand.  But itâ€™s such a tricky thing.. finding what that happiness is.  Always one person or the other.. never both.. seeming to look at one another and thinking.. yes.  This would be happiness.  But only one of the two.  Thatâ€™s always the problem.  So here my friend is, looking at her, and sheâ€™s looking at him.. and both thinking, yes.  Yet he struggled against it. *sighs*  I know.  Itâ€™s always easier looking in from the outside on these situations.  Iâ€™m just still adjusting to being on the outside in all things.  On that lovely, cheerful, exhausted note (insomnia.. you hag, you), yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  Or something to that effect, dear readers.

						   Okay, so the brakes are fixed.  The lines were cut.  Hmm.  I know.  Let's not go there.  The computer is back on its electronic feet, and the car is back on its brake pads, so they're good to go for a while longer.  Looking to move, shortly, I hope.  Mixed issue, that.  But mostly positive.  Friend of mine is talking perhaps rooming together.  Daft girl.  She'll never know what hit her if she does that.  Muwahahahaha!  lol  Random brain spewing, here.  No calls at work, and Zuma and Mah Jongg are about too boring.  I left the copy of The DaVinci Code in the car, so I can't read that.  I've thought of taking up weaving belly button lint, but I'm saving that up for a rainy day.  Alright, yeah, yeah, I know.  It's always raining in Oregon.  Maybe I've got a LOT of belly button lint.  I'm not telling.  Show me yours, I'll show you mine.  Maybe.  I think positive things are finally coming around for me, now that I've gotten a lot of the old garbage cleared away that was in my path, but I'm about out of patience for getting there.  Still waiting for some guy to come to my door, tell me his name is Calgon, and he's come to take me away.  Problem is, I know too well he'll be wearing a white coat (white knight, you're thinking?) and offer me a self-affirmation jacket.. you know the one.  Where it helps you hug yourself, has all those straps?  They're coming to take me away, hee hee ha ha ho ho....  Pffft.  I'll opt for the bath salts, instead.  Looking forward to having a bath tub I can call my own, again.  Or at least RENT and call my own.  Wish me luck.

						   So it's just after 3 Sunday morning, and I'm still coming down off of my Oregon Shakespeare Festival high.  My friend, Tiffany, and I were doing a caffeine pill, sugar cookie, loud music buzz to drive for three and a half hours (okay, three, with how Tiff drives) to get back to town.  It was my first time to the festival, and I'm too jazzed for words, being the Shakespeare freak I am.  She and I have made a pact to go back every year together, maybe trading off each year from comedy to drama to tragedy, etc.  Switch it up a bit.  Spent way more than I should have, but I'm beyond caring.  Haven't vacationed in about three years, and never let myself just be... so it has been a long time coming.  I won't say there weren't sad moments for me.  Still not past my feelings for a certain party, regardless of his lack of feelings for me, this whole time, it seems.  Saw a Bob Marley shirt, thought of him.  Saw a peacock feather, thought of him and his cat.  He'd agreed to go with us to the festival, back a year ago, when she and I had first discussed it.  But life changes, as do people, and I really don't know if that was just one more thing he said to me without ever meaning it.  Irony of it is, today, Sunday, is his birthday.  His mom died a year ago last Thursday.  His ninth wedding anniversary with his beloved/hated wife was on my birthday.  Doesn't matter that I never mattered to him.  I loved him, and part of me still does.  Echoes of those feelings still resounding off my heart at times, but this, too, shall pass, as do all things.  So, to the better subject of the festival.  Can't begin to describe to you the many treasures I brought back with me, but suffice it to say, I've started replacing the rings I lost (after they slipped off my fingers unnoticed after losing the 110 lbs), and have added a lovely windchime to those I already have, which my ex-husband hated hearing.  Tiff and I wandered all over hell and back in that town and STILL didn't cover it all, but capped the day off with a lovely dinner (shrimp pasta for her, lemon snapper for me), after which we ran like mad women to the play in a beautiful Elizabethan theatre (also named that), with an open air stage.  Reminds me somewhat of the one in Shakespeare in Love, a movie I oft grumble about.  We've had our tickets for Much Ado About Nothing since February.  But something that was, somehow, the best part of the evening for me... I'm always saying everybody's self perception is screwed, comparatively speaking, versus what anybody else perceives of them.  My self esteem has straightened out pretty well from having been too heavy for too long, and I've quit seeing the stares of strangers as repulsion, and figured out what the men are thinking... but wow.  Get this.  In the scene wherein Benedict is speaking of what aspects he would find pleasing, and acceptable, in a wife, he first names three aspects, being a lady fair in feature, one who is wise, and one who is virtuous, pointing out three women in particular in the audience for these aspects, one to stage left, one to center stage, and one to stage right.  Starting with lady fair, he pointed to, and looked directly at, me three rows back.  I know he had to have picked us out ahead of time, because it wasn't a thing of searching faces and settling.  Quite direct about looking at we three in turn.  Tho' I'd note it that he made a joke of hesitating about the third lady, as if realizing she wasn't so virtuous, and switching back to the wise lady to also label her as virtuous, to which the audience took great delight.  Great day, great night, am DEFINITELY going to repeat it.

						   'Cause this young girl is all fed up with feeling this weary.  I have to wonder why I'm paying a therapist, when it seems like going back to sleeping with a stuffed animal (yes, I know.. regression) seems to be giving me the best sleep I've had in some time.  My friend, Reed, and I went and saw Shrek 2 together.  He later won a stuffed Shrek 2 Shrek doll from one of those crane games, gave it to me.  I got home from housesitting this last Sunday, went to climb into bed that night, and the Shrek doll was laying on my bed.  So I thought.. what the hell.  Wrapped my arm around it, curled up, fell to sleep.  My friend Tiffany posited the notion that it's because I want to curl up with somebody.. have that closeness and affection.  Perhaps a stuffed animal, having no issues of its own, no needs.. nothing.. no strings attached, as it were.. gives me the unconditional cuddle I've needed.  It doesn't dawn on me real often how much I miss Garfield, because I know he's better off.. but moments like that.. yeah.  So.  Also having figured out how abysmally horrible I seem to be at the "contact with other humans" game, I decided to quit caring.  Hasn't seemed to do me any good in the last two years or so.  Experienced a lot of pain, wrote a lot of poetry.. and that's about it.  I figured out I don't want to be alone.  I figured out I have no control over that, and the likelihood of meeting somebody compatible, much less somebody who would be passionate about me as I would be passionate about them?  Well.  I'm 33.  Hasn't happened yet.  Not mutually speaking, at least.  So up goes the white flag.  I expect I'll be doing some camping by myself.  Lot of other things by myself.  But I think I'm also finding peace in that, finally.  Don't know if the difference is a Shrek doll, or simply no longer aching for what I can't have.  Who knows?  I still say shut up, Otis.
