						   Me and Rachel were practicing the basic elements of the Swedish grammar (after Rachel had fixed her computer :-)).  1. We translated into Swedish several elementary sentenses such as:  Mary lives in a large and beautiful city. Mary bor i en stor och vacker stad.  She is a good girl. Hon är en snäll flicka.  She writes a long letter to a friend. Hon skriver ett långt brev till en vän.  etc etc  2. Then we recalled these four irregular plurals:  männen gässen lössen mössen  3. And we had a lot of trouble with incorporating these five words:  often -  ofta  seldom -  sällen  always -  alltid  never -  aldrig  usually -  vanligen   into simple sentences like "Jag skriven brev" (not sure if this is correct -- note that "brev" is a plural!)  Seems like it is possible to say it in these two ways:  a) Jag skriven brev ofta b) Ofta skriven jag brev  Or this:  Ofta muttra jag till mig Jag går i skola alltid  Homework:  1. Plurals of nouns 2. 20 most useful verbs  Adjö!

						   I know -- I've been slacking on this blog of mine these couple of days, and today I wanted to make an atonement -- write my analysis of the lyrics of "In The Court of The Crimson King" or to summarise my latest exploits in the Swedish language. But today I went to the GA Tech tennis centre and for the first time in my life faced semi-professional players. More than that -- I was playing for two straight hours which is my record. I don't need to tell you how spent I am, physically and mentally. I am hardly typing. So all the excercises in lampoonery are postponed till tomorrow.  Cheers to all.

						   I experienced a lack of good novels, and now I know more good novels than can I read in all my life.  I have had a lack of good music and now I have more good music than I have time to listen to it.  I believed that good films were scarce, but now it seems that my belief was essentially my ignorance.  But now I believe that good, intelligent, educated people are hard to find. Will I ever know more such people than I can have time to talk to them?

						   This is the post that I submitted to one Russian forum as a response to the question about "new and not-very-well-known musical groups".  Hello :-)  I am glad somebody is interested :-)  As I have already noted, progressive music is a tremendously rich topic, and as I would say, worthy of long, pleasurable discussions. How to begin to listen to progressive sound?  In my opinion, one should start not with specific groups, not with certain musicians, not with styles and different directions of progressive rock, but with the attitude to it.  The idea of progressive music and progressive music itself were born at the end of the 60's in England as a challenge to commercial, cheap sound and devoid of serious content lyrics, aimed at the mass audience. Progressive music was created for and directed at intellectuals -- people who regard music as a form of high art, in whom it invokes acute feelings and whom it stimulates for deep reflections. Indeed, I do not know any ardent admirers of progressive music who are not at the same time ardent admirers of literature and art in general. So if you do not think you are an intellectual, progressive music is not for you.  Progressive lyrics almost never contain overly-simplified teenager-like lines of pop, such as: "Love, love me do, You know I love you …" and openly aggressive, spite- and stupidity-brimming pathos of metal/trash/death/punk and suchlike, à la "Kill Them All". It is not uncommon for progressive rock musicians to orchestrate old legends or fairy tales, populate their texts and music with imaginary creatures living in other worlds, marvel at the beauty of nature, explore the deepest human emotions and speculate about the meaning of life. These topics are very complex and emotive, and this is why many progressive albums contain pieces more than ten minutes in length, and in many cases each album has a common theme and tells one story where each track is a chapter, quite in contrast to a simpler music where each track has to tell a separate story …  The patterns of progressive music vary greatly in their structure, but their common feature is the accentuation of the instrumental parts, created by keyboards, guitars, drums and more exotic instruments (including human voice). There are also several clearly marked styles – symphonic progressive rock, psychodelic progressive rock, space progressive rock, neo progressive rock, art rock, fusion, zheul and others.  It is rather difficult to start giving concrete recommendations or directions, because I do not know your intellectual background, musical preferences and knowledge in music in general. Perhaps, what I am going to recommend to start with, you already know very well. Let me just facilitate my task by assuming that you are starting off from the scratch.  Almost all the greatest progressive rock bands or individual musicians are English, but progressive music of significant merit also comes from Scotland, France, Italy, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, USA, Mexico, and, I believe, even Russia. Still, I would recommend to start from English music, and specifically from the two pillars of progressive music and 20-century music in general – “Pink Floyd” and “Genesis”. Following is the approximate “listening list” for the beginner, if you are not really familiar with these bands. I cannot believe that you have never heard their pieces, but, remember, it’s the attitude that is important – you should start listening to their whole albums, ponder over their lyrics and study their history. This music is not for entertainment, so you cannot take it as lightly as anything you are likely hear on the mass radio or TV.  So, here’s the list. Start with the upper albums and end with the lower ones. This is my personal recommendation.  “Pink Floyd”: 1. “Wish You Were Here” (1975) 2. “The Dark Side of The Moon” (1973) 3. “Atom Heart Mother” (1970)  “Genesis”: 1. “And Then There Were Three” (1978) 2. “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway” (1974) 3. “Seconds Out” (1977)  If you don’t like these, progressive music is not for you. You will not equally be able to enjoy Meredith or Modigliani.  But if you do like these, or know them already, I see we speak the same language and I’m approaching your very question about the rare or not-so-well-known groups. The first recommendation here would obviously be the Swedish “Anglagard”. Listen to both their albums:  “Hybris” (1992) “Epilog” (1994)  and visit their official website www.anglagard.net for further information. I discovered this group pretty recently through (again and again) www.progarchives.com and already value it as one of the greatest among progressive rock artists. It seems, I can listen to these two highly complex, unconventional and very-very Swedish (as their website truly notes) albums five times a day and not be tired of them!  If you’d like a more detailed discussion, I am always open to intelligent conversation.  Regards, Arteum

						   Tonight I have finished reading "All's Well That Ends Well". Following are my first impressions after closing the book, unaffected by anyone else's opinion.  What a puzzling, inhomogeneous play it is! Puzzling because it's hard to find explanations for the heroes' illogical actions, especially at the end of the play (for example, Helena's spreading the news of her death, Diana's contradictory confession before the king, or the king's easy forgiveness), and inhomogeneous because it captures attention periodically, in between strong and week scenes. The great comic episode is Parolles' capture, but it is nearly the only part of the play that will be firmly indented in the reader's memory. Of course, the text was not meant for a reader but for a watcher ... and perhaps, watching the play on the stage will make me change my first opinion of it. I suppose, beside Parolles, Lafeu (who seems a rather dull personage in the text) may be acted as a slightly comical figure, and the clown's witticisms may be brought to a better light.  Sure I am in one: the play certainly cries out for dramatic power and in its value should not rise much above "Two Gentlemen of Verona". Interestingly, "All's Well That Ends Well" has the same kind of precipitate, hardly believable ending as "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "As You Like It", which, again, does not add to its merit.  Now that I have vented the first fumes, I need a more thorough reflection about the play as well as reading its criticism in order to decide if "Two Gentlemen of Verona" has a worthy companion.  ** "The Magus"   pregnable  = able to be captured etc.; not impregnable   a hasp  = a hinged metal clasp that fits over a staple and can be secured by a padlock [origin: OE] ("... I had to saw halfway through the hasp of the padlock ...")   " '... are you asking me to commit osculation?' laughed the ever-playful Fanny."   [a phrase from the book Nicholas found in the Earth]   "... I pulled down the whole lot and out of one of the books, an old printed copy of Punch 1914 (in which various pictures had been ticked in rad crayon) ..."  [I can actually go to Emory and touch the copy of what Nicholas touched!!]   "The eight sheet was a typewritten copy of The Tempest passage Lily had recited to me."  [to think of her less highly]   " ominus dominus Nicholas homullus est ridiculus  igutur meus parvus pediculus multo vult dare sine morari  in culus illius ridiculus Nicholas collosicus ciculus "   Baron von Masoch Plato  Madame de Sade  [no, this is too much for my poor brain, need to turn to something easier, mathematics, perhaps]  For example,   "Baron von Masoch sat on a pin Then sat again, to push it in"

						   It is my habit to read several novels or plays at the same time. Usually four or five. What is it that I'm working on now?  1. Jown Fowles, "The Magus" [No doubt, one od the best intelelctual literary creations in the 20th century; I am reading it for the second time.]  2. Jane Austen, "Pride and Prejudice" [Do not simper please :-) Everyone has to read it some time]  3. Benjamin Disraeli, "Coningsby" [A political novel, the first in a trilogy, by a prominent English politician and writer]  4. William Shakespeare, "All's Well That Ends Well" [No need to introduce that]  5. Лев Толстой, "Анна Каренина" [Yes, although I am Russian, this is my first experience with Лев Толстой]  And these are some comments I made yesterday while reading a few opening chapters of "Coningsby":   "The walls of the saloon, which were covered with light blue satin, held in silver pannels portraits of beautiful women painted by Boucher."    François Boucher [1703-1770]: French painter and decorative artist.   a dunce, a dullard  = a person slow at learning  A very strong passage from Disraeli:   "We are too apt to believe that the character of a boy is easily read. 'Tis a mystery the most profound. Mark what blunders parents constantly make as to the nature of their own offspring, bred too under their eyes, and displaying every hour their characteristics. How often in the nursery does the genius count as a dunce because he is pensive; while a rattling urchin is invested with almost supernatural qualities because his animal spirits make him impudent and flippant! The school-boy above all others is not the simple being the world imagines. In that young bosom are often stirring passions as strong as our own, desires not less violent, a volition not less supreme. In that young bosom what burning love, what intense ambition, what avarice, what lust of power; envy that fiends might emulate, hate that man might fear!"    "... and then proceeded with her chicken-pie."  [Wow, there were chicken pies at that time! It's interesting whether they looked the same as the modern American chicken pies!]   "All the gentlemen who expected to have been made peers, perceived that the country was going to be given over to a rapacious oligarchy."  [The term "oligarch" must have been well in use in England!]    a cue  = the last words of an actor's speech serving as a signal to another actor to enter or speak; a signal for action  !! I'm beginning to admire Disraeli:   "The other gentleman was of a different class and character. Nature had intended Lucian Gay for a scholar and a wit; necessity had made him a scribbler and a buffoon. He had distinguished himself at the University; but he had no patrimony, nor those powers of perseverance which success in any learned profession requires."

						   [WARNING: This post has an adult content and may be offensive to some people.]  I always wanted to tell this story.   Perhaps you have seen adult XXX magazines. Perhaps you even peeped inside (out of nothing more but sheer curiousity, of course). If you did you might have noticed that somewhere on the first few pages (you surely did not venture to read the rest of the pages) there are letters from the readers of the magazine and answers to these letters. These letters are from men writing to the women whose photos appeared in the previous issues of the magazine. Of such letters that I have seen, most may easily compete for the first prize at the competition for the dumbest literary composition. However, one letter was quite remarkable in its ingenuity:   Dear ----,  Like the cum that settles all around me, I have found a new home. The waifs and whores that used to give me shelter are all as one to me now.  Walking across the living room I take my oh-so-tight pants off. Laying beside you, I look into your eyes. Sweet ----, with your still lake-eyes so blue, don't you know my lust for you? You ... you must groan in your own special way, and I would like to help.  Marry me, Duke   If this does not make sense to you, please read the title of this post.  But this message apparently made sense to the girl to whom it was addressed, for she (or somebody else, who acted as her representative), made a following straightforward reply to it:   Dear Duke,   ---- on me, I love new ---- and right now I'm all alone. I'll make you whine and moan too and give you a ---- something special, if you like. ----, ---- it right in my ...  [etc etc]   Lovely, lusty poetry from me to you, ----

						   I have hardly ever seen a horror film that would be able to scare an intellectual. Vicious monsters with litres of saliva dripping off their nested jaws, ridiculous, unphysical, purposeless zombies and living dead, fairy-tale vampires -- all this is a good prop for ten year old children, but surely not for an adult intelligent person. Films which are based on streams of blood are more repulsive than horrifying, and those toying with superstition or conventional religious beliefs are simply laughable.  What is really scary is the unknown. What sends shivers down your spine and makes your blood curdle is the unexplainable.  The other civilizations, for example, which almost certainly exist.  But ...  Why do aliens in horror films have heads? Is it possible for them also not to have teeth and claws? Why all of them are large, powerful, carnivorous predators?  They just look ludicrous, those monsters, especially if they are always defeated in the end.  Much scarier as an alien is something that looks like a transparent ball of blue jelly and has no tendency to produce roaring sounds or to attack people. It has no limbs, but upon close examination reveals a complex, highly organised structure. It functions, exists, as if paying no attention to us and we do not understand its purpose. We apply different tests to it and it reacts to these tests in a rather unpredictable way. We spend years and years studying it only to arrive at no definite conclusion about its origin and meaning. In the end we almost give up and declare it just a blue jelly-ball, when one day it bewilders and horrifies us by its stunning intellectual superiority over humans ...  [Spooky sound effects go here]  Or imagine an alien which speaks or thinks in parallel. It can generate many ideas at the same time, mix them into one complicated signal, and vocally or telepathically transmit it to another such alien, who receives and decodes the signal in parallel too. And of course, the results of these parallel thinking channels may be combined and analysed together ... Suppose creatures who thus live parallel lives [in human sense of the word 'life'] ...  Isn't this more interesting to film than stupid zombies or blood-thirsty maniacs?

						   The time has come for me to go online too, with my personally-maintained web page!  It is 20 July, 14:45 EST (Eastern Standard Time), and I am listening to the beginning of a match of the European football championship -- Spain vs. Portugal. Listening because I live in the United States, where people are mostly unaware of the tournament's existence. Indeed, I would be surprised if most of them knew that there is such a country as Portugal. So it is nowhere on American TV. The match promises to bring all the excitement and drama, since the both teams have a handful of well-known, scintillating players, advocate attacking football and because Portugal need a win in order to advance to the next, quarter-final stage. It is 0-0 so far.  [Ten hours later]  The final score is 0-1, Portugal win and advance to the next round while Spain go home as a result of Russia's defeat of Greece in a parallel match: 2-1.  This all is not very intersting to read because you may find this information on several hundred other websites ... I'd like to believe that it was only a warm-up for my first online publishing. In future I shall try to be more creative :-)

						   The title that I initially intended for this post was "Americans, learn to drive!!!", but some careful thinking&nbsp;made me change&nbsp;it, in order&nbsp;to aim&nbsp;at a more specific group of people, whose horrible driving habits I see (and feel) everyday.  &nbsp;  Two days ago my little cozy&nbsp;"Toyota Corolla" was violently hit from behind by a monstrous in size and weight "GMC Suburban".&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who was behind the wheel of the SUV was being apparently very negligent and failed to pay proper attention to traffic lights. My car was declared a total loss and I am lucky to&nbsp;remain relatively unhurt -- no scratches or broken bones, but some of my muscles have worked pretty hard at the moment of collision, and I still feel the effect of it. If you saw my car after the collision you would be&nbsp;surprised that I&nbsp;stayed alive!  &nbsp;  Spurred on by this unfortunate accident, and warmed by multitudionous cases of bad driving that I become witness of every day, I decided to give my word of warning to those those who drive aggressively and&nbsp;give my advice and recommendations to those who have to defend against reckless drivers.&nbsp; I doubt the quality of driving in Atlanta is going to&nbsp;improve after I publish this little post in this blog, but at least I hope to prevent a few accidents.  &nbsp;  Advice # 1: Do not buy a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) unless you absolutely must! Studies reveal that only a small fraction of Americans buy SUVs for the purpose of off-road experience. I suppose you don't need exact references -- you may easily believe me. By the way, with avoiding SUVs I also recommend stopping watching (or taking any&nbsp;activity in) baseball and American football. Better take your flabby belly in a gym! SUVs are&nbsp;fuel-devouring, environment-polluting&nbsp;monsters, dangerous to drive and&nbsp;dangerous to other drivers! Many people think that SUVs are, on the contrary, safer to drive than&nbsp;ordinary cars, but&nbsp;this&nbsp;opinion may be possibly true only for collisions&nbsp;(safer for the owner of the SUV),&nbsp;since SUVs are unstable on high speed and slippery roads and are vulnerable to capsizing. They also do a bad job at turns. Besides, SUVs are simply ugly (with the exception of a few Japanese models)! What kind of person do you have to be in order to like the look, say of a GMC Suburban? A fat, dumb, middle-aged baseball watcher with a small beard round your mouth (men)&nbsp;or a wife of such a person (women), obnoxious and aggressive, very probably a&nbsp;country-music listener. That's the best characteristic of SUV owners that I may give. Do you expect such a lazy, rude, uneducated person as I described to drive&nbsp;with any respect to others?  &nbsp;  Advice # 2. If you change lanes without the use of your mirrors, you drive incorrectly. It is amazing how many people rely on turning their head for a second to see if there is any car in the adjacent lane! You may turn your head, but for a second you lose control of what's going on&nbsp;in front of you, and then you saw the&nbsp;position of other cars to&nbsp;your left or your right with a duration of a second! Next moment, when you are actually turning your wheel, thinking all is safe, cars around you may already change their positions -- some crazy drivers&nbsp;change three lanes in a second on highways!&nbsp;You are always an amateur driver if you turn your head. You absolutely must set up your mirrors so that you eliminate the blind spot, and learn to use only mirrors while changing lanes!  &nbsp;  See  &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.smartmotorist.com/mir/mir.htm   &nbsp;  or  &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.miata.net/misc/mirrors/   &nbsp;  The rule that works best for me is the following: sit as you normally do in your driver seat. Set up the left mirror so that when you touch your left door window with your head, you can see the body of your car a little. Normally, when you keep your head straight, you don't have to see your car at all! Then do the same operation with your right mirror. Tilt your head to the right until it's in the middle of your car and make sure you can see only a small portion of your car. This ensures you have eliminated the blind spot. Check the above websites for the instructions of how to use these mirrors.  &nbsp;  When&nbsp;looking in&nbsp;the mirrors while changing lanes, you keep one&nbsp;eye on the road and another on the position of the cars around you. You may look in the mirror five times faster than&nbsp;a what a turn of your head takes! Besides,&nbsp;you are observing the location of other vehicles continuously while changing lanes. This&nbsp;allows you to react quickly if you see&nbsp;that a car suddenly appeared beside you.  &nbsp;  Advice # 3: Be patient and respectful! It often happens that I drive on an Atlanta highway at 65 mph&nbsp;in the rightmost lane, and although the speed limit is 55 mph, someone behind me&nbsp;wants to go at least 75 mph. This person, although it&nbsp;remains&nbsp;just 1/10 of a mile until the exit where we both leave the highway, suddenly overtakes me,&nbsp;and zips back into the exit lane in front of me just to exit&nbsp;one second before me!&nbsp;This is basically an invitation to an accident. Another common situation&nbsp;is when&nbsp;someone's car is stopped at the middle of the road to turn, or because it's not functioning, and I, having stopped behind it,&nbsp;need to change the lane we're in&nbsp;to go around it. I cannot do it immediately, because there are cars&nbsp;in the next lane&nbsp;going at 35 mph at least. So I am waiting for 10-20 seconds before the lane next to me clears. During this time a few cars naturally stop behind me, and instead of letting me turn first (because I am the first in the line), they move in the lane at the first available moment and push hard on gas!&nbsp;People, are you people or beasts&nbsp;fighting for survival?  &nbsp;  More to follow.&nbsp;

						   This promises to be one of the busiest weeks in my life: before my departure to England on the 20th of July, I need to finish an article (of which only the Introduction is written) and prepare a poster. The time seems to be in plenty to accomplish both these tasks; the only hindrance is that the research results that are to go into the article and the poster are not ready yet! When will they be ready? Who knows? It depends on the number of bugs in my programmes (which are also not finished yet ...). If there are many bugs ... I suspect it'll take me two or three days to extirpate them ... And then I need to run the programmes for a couple of days to collect the data ... The initial plan was to finish this all very comfortably by the 10th of July ...  So one would say I hardly have time for reading Jane Austen, studying the Czech language or playing chess online ... and yet I do it! Not as intensively as before, it is true, but I still somehow feel no real time pressure ... Maybe I'll feel cornered at the very end, on the 17th or 18th? Maybe it's normal to finish everything on the last day?

						   How many languages do I speak? Three fluently -- Russian, Ukrainian and English. In French I can read a bit and can communicate basic things such as: "My name is Arnold Shwarzenegger. I am an lumberjack. I live in Sahara." So, it seems, I have only one language to learn -- French. That's not a whole lot ... Recently I have added two more languages to French to make up three, to addle my brain and to complicate my life even more. Three is a whole lot now. This excerpt from a letter explains how this 66.66...% addition happened.  "... And lately, quite unexpectedly, I got involved into studying two more languages! I always had a great sympathy with the Swedes and liked their music (some of it sung in the Swedish langauge), and was toying with the idea of studying it some time in the future -- because if you want to study English professionally (which is what I am trying to do), apart from other things, you also need the knowledge of French and some Scandinavian language. I did a little research and found out that the most typical and ubiquitous scandinavian language is Swedish! So I started to read about its grammar, without any intention of studying it seriously -- and I was simply fascinated by the very untypical way Swedish language worked! Although it's Indo-European, in many aspects it is very different from either English, French, German or Russian! For example, there are two genders in Swedish but they do not coincide with masculine/feminine! Thus, "a boy" and "a girl" grammatically fall into one gender! The ways of using articles and constructing plurals are weird as well! And so, as I was reading about all this, an American girl whom I had never met before, e-mailed to me and said that she was very interested in learning the Russian language (whe turned out to be a very bookish person and apparently is studying Russian for her own knowledge, not just for a class), and would be very grateful if I could assist her with it. I consented, and in return she promised to help me with English (since she thought Russians were notoriously bad at English). But it soon became clear to that English is gradually becoming my first language ... and she said that she knew some Swedish and could try to teach me Swedish instead! That was a wonderful coincidence -- I thought this chance would be bad to miss ... and now we meet twice a week online to study Russian and Swedish!  Another language I unexpectedly discovered for myself was Czech. The fact is that my neighbour is a Czech girl, Olga, and we have been playing tennis for some time. She did not speak Russian (although she had been studying it in school for a year before the fall of the Soviet era) and so we were speaking English. We always knew there were great similarities between Czech and Russian, but when I, out of curiosity decided to read about the Czech grammar I was simply stunned! Czech was much closer to Ukrainian than to Russian! And as I know both Ukrainian and Russian I saw that I don't need to learn the most awesome (in the traditional sense of the word), especially for a Western person, part of the Czech language -- multiple conjugations and word changes -- they were almost identical to Ukrainian ones and I use them naturally, without thinking! Many words are also very similar to those of either Ukrainian or Russian language! So it seemed I had a native speaker of Czech at hand and 90% of grammar essentially learned, and again it would be bad to miss such a great chance to learn Czech too! And now I can really hope that I will really be able to re-read "The Good Soldier Schweik" (the most famous novel of the Czech literature) in the original language! Now whenever I meet Olga, I try to speak to her in Czech and she corrects me, and we often laugh when we find how funny something sounds in Czech (to me) and in Ukrainian (to her). According to my estimations, I'll be able to speak Czech fluently in just two or three months! Isn't it great? ... "

						   Here is another Mathematica function that I wrote. This time it is combinatorial. I needed to go over  all the sets of unconnected clusters of different sizes (to understand what I mean exactly, read my upcoming aticle in Mol. Phys.), and in order to generate them I had to use this function.  OrderedRangeSets[st_,fin_,len_] constructs all the possible ordered arrays of length len which have as elements integers starting from st and ending at fin. The increment between the two nearest elements should be either 0 or 1. The first element is always st.   Pay particular attention to my favourite (and original? -- never saw this done by other people) technique of constructing tables of arbitrary size using the ToExpression function. I've got ten or so functions written where this trick turned out to be very useful.   OrderedRangeSets[st_,fin_,len_]:=Module[{k},ReturnProduct={};              If[fin>=st,                  Indices=Table["k"<>ToString[k],{k,1,len}];         IndRanges="";                  For[k=1,k                      If[k==1,             IndRanges=                 StringJoin[IndRanges,                   "{k1,"<>ToString[st]<>","<>ToString[st]<>"},"];             ,                          IndRanges=               StringJoin[IndRanges,                 "{"<>ToString[Indices[[k]]]<>",k"<>ToString[k-1]<>","<>"If["<>                   "k"<>ToString[k-1]<>"=="<>ToString[fin]<>","<>ToString[fin]<>                   ",k"<>ToString[k-1]<>"+1]},"]             ];           k++;           ];                  IndRanges=StringDrop[IndRanges,-1];                  StrIndices=ToString[ToExpression[Indices]];                  ToExpression[           "Table["<>"ReturnProduct=Append[ReturnProduct,"<>StrIndices<>"],"<>             IndRanges<>"];"];                  Return[ReturnProduct];                  ,                  Return[             "Error: the finishing value is smaller than the starting value."];                  ];              ];  These are some examples of this function's use:  In[178]:= OrderedRangeSets[2,5,7]  Out[178]= {{2,2,2,2,2,2,2},{2,2,2,2,2,2,3},{2,2,2,2,2,3,3},{2,2,2,2,2,3,4},{2,2,2,2,3,3,     3},{2,2,2,2,3,3,4},{2,2,2,2,3,4,4},{2,2,2,2,3,4,5},{2,2,2,3,3,3,3},{2,2,2,     3,3,3,4},{2,2,2,3,3,4,4},{2,2,2,3,3,4,5},{2,2,2,3,4,4,4},{2,2,2,3,4,4,     5},{2,2,2,3,4,5,5},{2,2,3,3,3,3,3},{2,2,3,3,3,3,4},{2,2,3,3,3,4,4},{2,2,3,     3,3,4,5},{2,2,3,3,4,4,4},{2,2,3,3,4,4,5},{2,2,3,3,4,5,5},{2,2,3,4,4,4,     4},{2,2,3,4,4,4,5},{2,2,3,4,4,5,5},{2,2,3,4,5,5,5},{2,3,3,3,3,3,3},{2,3,3,     3,3,3,4},{2,3,3,3,3,4,4},{2,3,3,3,3,4,5},{2,3,3,3,4,4,4},{2,3,3,3,4,4,     5},{2,3,3,3,4,5,5},{2,3,3,4,4,4,4},{2,3,3,4,4,4,5},{2,3,3,4,4,5,5},{2,3,3,     4,5,5,5},{2,3,4,4,4,4,4},{2,3,4,4,4,4,5},{2,3,4,4,4,5,5},{2,3,4,4,5,5,     5},{2,3,4,5,5,5,5}}  In[179]:= OrderedRangeSets[3,3,4]  Out[179]= {{3,3,3,3}}  In[180]:= OrderedRangeSets[3,2,4]  Out[180]= Error: the finishing value is smaller than the starting value.

						   Unbelievable!  Unbelievable to such an extent that the word "unbelievable" sounds stale and commonplace! Greece, which were considered as a joke of a team by everybody, even by Greek citizens and Greek sport commentators, are the champions of Europe! Who would imagine that their starting win against the hosts Portugal was not a tremendous fluke, but a sure step towards reaching the summit? Isn't it amazing how the respected, praised and admired teams like Germany, France, England, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands have been vanquished and thrown off the tournament one by one, each leaving with something special blame, and how the unknown, unprepossessing, Greece clung on and on, ignoring jokes directed at them, and tenaciously defending their way to Mount Olympus?   Isn't it becoming a bit of a farce now that the footballers from "Real Madrid" or "Manchester United" who get payed millions of dollars a year and are basking in fame, are not capable of clinching a place even in the semifinals, whereas the footballers from Greece, one of the poorest countries in Europe, whose football league attracts no attention from the European sport community and who have never been victorious in a major international match, confidently win the biggest football competition in Europe? Where is the "best player in the world", peerless Zidane, where is "the most expensive player in the world", the virtuoso Figo, where is the most famous footballer in England, Beckham? Charisteas, Nikopolidis, Zagorakis and Otto Rehhagel -- these are the names to look up to and to remember!   Bravo, Greece! Bravo the new European Champions!  And quite unexpectedly for them, Russia may get some piece of Greek fame too. In any case, Russia was the only team to defeat Greece at Euro 2004!

						   I should have started long ago a library of useful Mathematica functions that I wrote! Here's one of such functions. It's called BlockDiagonalMatrix[Matr__]. It takes any number of square matrices and constructs a large block-diagonal matrix out of them.  BlockDiagonalMatrix[Matr__ ] := Module[{i, Len, Dim, Cursor},              Len = Length[{Matr}];       Dim = 0;       For[i = 1, i          Dim = Dim + Length[{Matr}[[i]]];         i++;         ];              BigMatrix = Table[0.0, {i, 1, Dim}, {j, 1, Dim}];              Cursor = 1;       For[i = 1, i          Table[           BigMatrix[[m, n]] = {Matr}[[i]][[m - Cursor + 1,                  n - Cursor + 1]], {m, Cursor,              Cursor + Length[{Matr}[[i]]] - 1}, {n, Cursor,              Cursor + Length[{Matr}[[i]]] - 1}];         Cursor = Cursor + Length[{Matr}[[i]]];         i++;         ];              Return[BigMatrix];       ];

						   As usual, it takes me hours to digest a page of Horst Schubert's "Categories". Today on the menu are the following puzzles.  In chapter 3 we decided to move to re-construct our definition of categories by introducing universes  U . So now a category  C  consists of a  U -class Mor  C  and a composition rule. Note: there are no objects any more. They have been substituted by identity morphisms! What Schubert writes after this definition is: "In particular, this composition determines the class of identity morphisms of  C , denoted by 1-Mor  C  ..."  Question # 1: Are Mor  C  and 1-Mor  C  two "separate" (in a class-ical meaning of the word :-)) classes? Why is it not possible to simply make 1-Mor  C  a substructure of Mor  C , say, a set?  In section 3.3.6 one may read that "... a category is  U -small if 1-Mor  C  is a set. This is equivalent to Mor  C  being a  U -set."  Question # 2: Why is this so? If both Mor  C  and 1-Mor  C  are classes, how making 1-Mor  C  a set transforms Mor  C  into a set as well?  Perhaps I'll go and read the definition of small categories in other sources ...
