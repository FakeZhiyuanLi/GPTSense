      well... i have needed a lot of sleep!!!  i crossed theroom, and what ou did was to feel my hair over and over again and in different ways, touch it, with the palmof your hand... felt it strands of hair, with your fingers, touched it as if it were cloth, the way a child touches it's favorite surfaces....  Edna O Brien...  all right... it would be nice to have more direct interaction, but i guess you don't want to do that right now...  the way i feel is that i want to talk to y o u... i want to feel y o u... it's the way i feel... i don't want more things inbetween us...i want less things inbetween us... is that sooooo bad? love, wanda

      wow.... it's sunday... of course woke up later than usual... and got into making this picture for site... but should have written first.... !!!!  i may have to register for 1 class this semester...i'm really not in the mood to argue with mom about that...not looking forward to months of her chiding me for not being in a class... that will still give me time to work on pictures and now... movies!...ok!!!! and focus more on gym...which is really my main big push right now.... i really need that ourward schedule.... otherwise i get superexcitedly involved in creative internet activities and frankly... lose track of time... it's not fair to you or me.... i will update calander today....it's only proper i do so.  kisses and dna love, W A N D A  have you e  v e r noticed.... our names wanda (k~~~~)  both 5 letters, both unusual names... both go together, mom picked Wanda because i was born in germany (Vanda), and my biological dad's name was Willehard Westling (my original name was Wanda Westling...) i think it's Finnish.  When she married Jack... he adopted us and we became Leonards. )
