      England v Portugal.  How can you have a Swiss ref when less than a week a go England have helped to knock Switzerland out of the competition?  Anyway, much anger shouting and kicking walls.  Why oh why do the English get penalised by dodgy refs, wonder if it goes back to the days of the empire and it's revenge of some sort? Having recently been to Crete and announcing myself as a native of Greece i'm glad to see they are still in the competition though.   urlLink Michaels blog ?  The man is a genius, or seriously messed up.  Work, why? As much as I have tried to play down its importance in my life I seem to be constantly tortured by it. This probably comes down to the fact that I get ripped off by bosses left, right and centre, I am apparantely too nice. All I ever wanted was to be paid what i'm worth, and when I was single have something nice to look at (occasionaly play with when I got lucky). Instead i've gone from job to job receiving all the plaudits in the world but never getting the same pay and treatment as those around me. I've been contracting for the government for about 8 months now, with them nagging at me to go full-time! So after waving a farewell to my stop-start development career I decided to give them what they wanted. Six months it has taken them to get all this 'sorted' but I still haven't received a written offer of what they are going to give me.  Bearing in mind Jo Average in my office is on 18-20k a year, I have far more qualifications and experience than any of them, so would reasonably expect 17-18k minimum. On Friday I spoke to the boss again and it looks as though they are going to dismiss my experience as not being relevant just so they can get me on the cheap??? Why would they do this, the software I have written for them has and will save hundreds of man hours, I did it as a favour!  THEY BLOODY WANTED ME, I WAS NAGGED INTO SHOWING AN INTEREST! I SCAN F'IN SCUM CHEQUES FOR A LIVING NOW! When the inevitable cost cuuting offer comes through I will of course tell them to shove it up their arses and will find something else to pay the bills.  Just once, I would like to be offered the going rate without all the hastle! I have a business meeting tomorrow after work with one of my "bosses" regarding some outside development work he wants done, they respect what I bring to the party and still try to get it cheap????????  This weekend has been all about Getmail again, sounds weird but I feel a sort of commitment to the people using it and getting a new release out. Why, I don't know, its free.  Anyay, thats all for now, going for an all you can eat Indian tonight at some place in Ramsey which should be fun.  I 'm going to try and upset my stomach so that I can stink them out in work tomorrow, not that i'm spitefull

      Found out today that I cant write these things at work, network admins and security, I shake my fist!  This means that i'm going to limit my updates to a couple of times a week, I already spend way to much time on computers, according to the better half anyway - love you babe  After the crapness of Friday, the weekend was a pleasant one.  Laura had a dance festival which meant I was left to my on devices on Saturday.  I finally got to release the set of updates for  urlLink GetMail  which I had been holding on to for a couple of weeks.  With all this gmail stuff it has really taken off and i'm getting a couple of thousand downloads a day, answering support questions is taking up loads of my time as well but I do my best to be helpfull.  Anyway, the millions of pounds coming my way make it worthwhile ;)  Other than that I watched Troy, which was excellent, if,  like me you always try to guess whats going to happen when watching a film this was brilliant (unless you are already familiar with the story).  Who would have thought Brad Pitt playing a bi-bloke (cousin my arse) with a nasty streak?  Bit of a rushed en....  Sunday I was supposed to be going to see my dad but the whole family is down with colds and I was advised to stay clear.  Instead I was nagged into going to the dancing to watch Laura.  In all honesty it was a pleasure and she's dancing so much better since she changed dance schools.  She was ace and we were robbed!  Being a 25 year old bloke I hardly fit in with the rest of the crowd but if I cant go and watch my little girl dancing every now and then when what sort of a dad am I?  When I get some more time i'm going to post a picture or 2 of Laura doing her dancing, she's great.  Yesterday was about one thing and one thing only for me. EN-GE-LAND!!!!!!!!!!  The boys did well even if was a nervy start.  By the end all 3 of us were jumping around the living room, i'm sure Suzanne and Laura were more excited for me than England.  Can't wait for Thursday, bring on Portugal.  Hopefully Col will get a pass so I've got a wingman and can go for a couple of beers and soak up a bit of Euro pub atmosphere.  Go on fella get it sorted, show G who's boss!  Those who know me well, know I like a rant.  Well today in work I found a classic.  Budgeting loans for scummers.  Check  urlLink this  out.  Now normal people like you and me have to worry about interest rates, credit histories, repayments, earning a living etc etc but not so if you are on in come support benefits, not pensioners mind you.  Need a new pair of £100 trainers?  Here you go, have this money, pay us back out of the free money we give you at £5 a week, interest free!  Feel like re-decorating your free council house?, broken washing machine?  Don't worry about it, get a budgeting loan!  Just got out of prison, here you go son, have some free money!  Pisses me off no end, these people can have £1000 in savings and still borrow money interest free!  A lot of the time its even free altogether, no pay-back no nothing, no worries. Working for the DHSS i've had my eyes opened to sooooo many things but i'd probably be breaking all sorts of confidentiality laws even mentioning them, but needless to say, I and any decent normal person would be horrified at how they spend OUR money.    COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!!!!!!!

      Okay, after much hastling from my good friend  urlLink Paul King  i've decided to write down a selection of my thoughts and feelings.  Today has been one of the worst days I have ever experienced, even more so than when I electrofied my nether regions with a battery powered body toner.  Suzanne (the wife) has been un-happy in her job ever since I met her.  Every couple of weeks somebody would upset her resulting in her wanting to leave, again!  I've lost count of the times I've told her to just pack it in.  Today was another such day with her arguing with one of her work buddies, phoning and e-mailing me and generally being miserable.  Having gone through this routine a lot of times I decided to phone her boss and find out what was happening.  The man has no management skills, people skills and in general is not fit to hold the position he does.  Suzanne has quit, i have nothing but shitty phone calls and arguments all day.  My own contract isn't sorted properly yet, the missus will be un-employed soon enough... all in all not very good.    After this crap day at work was looking forward to a bit of r&r.  Not so though, we have just got a letter from our advocate (laywer) advising that the adoption battle for our daughter will be dragged out even more.  At 150 quid a letter plus vat and with money running out it rips me apart but we might have to give in and give her biological dad who has shit all over her all her life "one" last chance at not letting Laura down.  From my point of view I want what is best for Laura, Laura wants nothing to do with him but what can you do?!

      7, yes a great big SEVEN months it has taken to get work sorted out.&nbsp; I have spent the last week and a bit having arguments with personnel who appear to have done nothing since my successful interview 2 months ago.&nbsp; A huge thankyou to Paul King for being a top mate with the reference(personnel were lying about sending them out and then receiving them back), I felt like such a tw** having to ask and then ask again.&nbsp; Once again, cheers fella! In the end i&nbsp; had to run around and get my own references and hand deliver them because government personnel couldn't be trusted.&nbsp; The sacle these people are on&nbsp;is approx 21k - 26k ....  Anyways, now i have some work stability i figured it was time to decide what&nbsp;I wanted to do with computers.&nbsp; As a brief overview I have been programming since I was about nine, the first 8 years as a games programmer (ahhh, the Amiga, happy happy days!) and the the last 8 ( on and off)&nbsp; as a business application jobby.&nbsp; The only reason I switched was because i got paid to do it, not may games houses on craggy.&nbsp; Now, i'm not really getting paid to "do it" so the choice is mine.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have time for everything, work, business applications, games and so something has to give.&nbsp; I miss sprite detection routines, blitter objects, AI, image multi-plexing etc etc&nbsp; so i'm going to rap up my one major project (GetMail) and start down the the rocky path of games programming windows styleeee.&nbsp; Bring on DirectX!!!&nbsp; This will&nbsp;mean brushing up on my C++&nbsp;and several new technologies but should be fun, in a twisted sort of way.&nbsp; Books, I need books. Oh yeah, in case anybody put 2 and 2 together and gets 5 this has nothing to do with the Canadian one, if i'm not getting paid to design databases, right boring applications they why do it?!&nbsp; Games were what made me so games it is!  Suzanne and I have our first anniversary tomorrow.&nbsp; It has been a real struggle the last year, it started of with me accepting the job from hell the day before we got married and has ended with Suzanne having to bring a grievance against her boss.&nbsp; We have applied to adopt our daughter which should have been done and dusted by June, but we are still&nbsp;to have Police checks and so are months away from a decision.&nbsp; We have had deaths, most notably my uncle (and usher) 1 week after our wedding and had the dream of moving to a better house ripped away from us at the last minute.&nbsp; Throughout it all though we have remained as solid as a rock.&nbsp; I love her soo much that no matter what happens I know I have her, and I know the feelings mutual.&nbsp; And then we have Laura, you couldn't wish for a better kid, i'm so proud that she calls me dad.&nbsp; Looking back, cut out all the dick-heads and life is sweet!&nbsp; We are going to go out as a family tomorrow and watch a movie and get something to eat, tremendous.  Just to finish of, a quick film review:-  Stepford Wives - Suzanne liked it, I thought "where are the funny bits?", i'm thinking Royal Tenanbaums style American up its own arse crap.&nbsp; Suzanne watched the original the night before and recommends watching that one instead.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I haven't updated this for a little while now, mainly because nothing of any interest whatsoever has happened.    Work is dull, still playing space, crap tv, comfy sofa - all is well.  I suppose yesterday I had a brief moment of rantism but it was nothing great.  Public Buses (or Busses).  I'm stuck on the bus system due to me being a bit stupid a few years ago, beer, no taxis and me having my car keys.  I should really have sorted out my license again by now but the cost of lessons is a serious rip off.  Anyway, i digress.  Why do they put seats facing each other on the lower deck on double deckers?  I got on the bus and due to limited availability broke one of my own golden rules, I sat on the back seat!  No sooner had I sat down than I found myself surrounded by a bevvy of beautiful young girls.  I thought to myself "This isn't so bad, bit of a result really!".  Then though, the moment, about 18, short skirt, cracking chest, pretty face sits down opposite me in the shittly arranged seating.  All of a sudden i'm face to face (about 18 inches apart) with this fine young thing.  I feel like i've been pushed into a romatic meal for 2 with somebody i've only just clapped eyes on.  Now here is the dilemma, where do you look?  I spent a couple of minutes trying different angles.  In the end I just thought sod it and settled for fading into my own dream world whilst I happended to be looking straight ahead.  The next thing I know i'm getting footsied and "hi, don't I know you?"  What the hell? Apparantely I was staring right at her which I admit must of been a little wierd but I couldn't help it.  Back in the day, the single days this would have been a great opportunity, these days it was just an awkward situation I could do without. I made pleasant conversation for the short journey but all the time it felt as though I had been locked in the broom cupboard with some strange young girl.  I thought this was just me so today I turned around to check out the people on the back seat.  It made me happy to see them all twitching looking for that golden angle.  Anybody any ideas on what the correct etiquette is for this?

      Well done the Greek lads, as my second country of birth I was very proud, the boys did well.  George from the Cheers bar in Hersonnisos will probably still be going ape shit. On my last day there he was explaining how the Greeks / Cretians don't care that much because "we are too rubbish" and were delighted just to be there. I could only be slightly happier if the English won, just a shame I didn't put my money where my mouth was when it all kicked off.    Long weekend and didn't get much done really.  Friday was a me and Suzanne day. Saturday I was very ill, throwing up all afternoon.  Don't know what caused it but I was fine again by 11pm.  Laura had ANOTHER dance comp and managed to come second beating all the others from her old school. Suzanne was very excited when they finally got home at 11:30, twas a good night!  Sunday was a right off, have no idea what I did but i'm sure it wasn't much.  Same for Monday.  Only thing of note is that I have started playing Space again to help fill the days on the gravy train.  Currently alive in galaxy 96, god that sounds sad!  Having got my adsl up and running at full speed i'm going through the process of downloading as many films as possible.  Over the weekend managed to watch Underworld (very good, you cant go wrong with vampires fighting werewolves), The Day After Tomorrow (excellent film but the title left me puzzled, it's more about the day before tomorrow and you never get to see the day after, sequel, maybe?).  I've got Around the World in 80 days and Van Helsing to fit in some time soon.  Will provide some more in depth reviews when I watch them.  Has anybody noticed any dns problems with blogspot.com .  I'm having to refresh pages loads of times before anything happens?     Anyway, thats all for now, Paul  ps Currently 4/0 in the lift game, i've never been this lucky in my whole life.

      It's not often i'm wrong, well it is, but its not often I admit I was wrong, but i'm prepared to eat my words this time. Work offered me a fairly fair contract which is a significant improvement on recent offers. After some finalising of details I have signed up for the service gravy train. They've got me as a generel office worker with no IT stuff involved, I get the right to refuse work that I don't see as suitable so cant argue with that.  On time finishing, gym down the road, enough money, no hastles - i'll probably be fed up in 2 months time then. One day my star will shine again.   So now my contract is sorted, all i've got to occupy me is the actual work, hence was very bored yesterday, bored to the point where I was thinking of ways to add a bit of risk to my "bean counting" work experience.  Thats when I came up with the lift game.  Everytime you use the lift in work (this is best if you do it while on your own in the lift), stand with your nose pressed against the door ready for it to stop.  Now here comes the fun bit, when it stops, jump out waving your arms and shouting.  If you're lucky i.e. the guns not loaded there will be nobody waiting.  If you're un-lucky you clatter into the boss or terrify the whinging girl that sits in the corner.  Anyway, childish, stupid a bit mental maybe but it has brightened up my days.  So far i'm 2/0...   Today is a day off, with the summer holidays coming up, Suzanne of work, I thought it would be good for us to have a day just to ourselves.  Hopefully Suzanne will get out of bed at some point. Pub lunch, driving, loving, who knows?

      Its been a very busy week, trips out, loads of computer stuff to do etc etc  Started last weekend with a trip to Peel to go fishing behing the castle.  I brought the rod, Laura had her net (for the rock pools) and a great time was had by all.  The weather was stunning and we all ended up a bit burnt.  I managed 1 Pollack (Callig locally) which we had for our tea.  To make the day that bit more special I took the opportunity to use it as my return to driving.  L plates firmly in place and off we go, I had no nerves about it but it will take Suzanne a long time to get used to me driving.  It all comes down to judging the width of the car, I drive through gaps that she would stop and let the other car go through, although in all honesty you could get a bus through!  Twice she shouted at me, mentalist.  Getting caught up in some vintage car thing was fun, it could only happen to me.  On Wednesday Suzanne and Laura went to Onchan park with Laura's dance school.  I met up with them after work.  After an initial mix-up which involved me walking laps around Onchan we finally got together for our free goes on the motorboats, bumper boats, crazy golf etc  Afterwards it was of to McD's for tea, do you know they've stopped doing SuperSize?? Why?  A little poxy box of fries is no good to me.  Big Brother is watching, I could understand it if they try to make the kids meals healthier but i'm a bloody grown man.  If I want to supersize something then its my choice.  I go to the gym 5 times a week, i'm not overweight but when I have McDonalds I like to have a lot, b'stards.  You can buy beer, fags, get yourself in all sorts of debt but you cant supersize a bloody McDonalds meal.  I was upset.  Now the reason I haven't been able to update my blog this week is because I have limited computer time, its best for the marriage that way.  To kick start my games programming career i've bought a couple of books which i've spent the last week and a half reading cover to cover.  Full of knowledge I used late Wednesday evening as my chance to get started.  I'm hardly a rookie at this, so I got everything set-up as I 'though' it should be done.  Starting at the bottom I thought it would be best to load an example and get that working first.  Load file, compile, build all, run.  Easy peasy, it is after all "For Dummies".  Not so, 164 warnings, 34 errors?!?!  Warnings don't bother me (Having spent years working with Michaels code, you get used to it.  Just supress them).  But why the errors.  TWO NIGHTS it has taken me to get ANYTHING to actually run.  It does nothing, but it runs.  I blame Microsoft, the promised backwards compatibility of DirectX isn't quite so.  Anyway I am now up and running and working on my game engine.  Knock a few basic games together and then come up with the killer idea, write and then retire living of the proceeds.  Sounds like a plan to me.  In the meantime though its work as normal.  Luckily i'm off for a week, my first paid holidays in 18 months so i'm really looking forward to it.  Today we are going on the train to Port Erin, Laura is bringing one of her freinds with her so should be a laugh.  Must remember to empty out the digi camera so it can come with us.
