       Monday, 31st May 2004       Haiz! This my blog and here, i shall fill you on with the events of my life starting from today. My life starts with a quite refreshed good night's sleep. Today was quite a disaster because i fell out with my bestest fren ever, Judy. I love her so much man. Haiz, luckily we patch up le or i really dunno how miserable i will be. Life has not be going on smoothly for me and i felt so miserable. I love all mi frens, mi family, mi everything but sometimes it gets on my nerves when people just dun understand you. Anyway, despite the disaster, i managed to be happy because of Francina. She is now one of my best frens. She is always there for me. Just some numbers, and there she is, on the other end of the line, giving me good advice and comforting me. Francina is really the only comfort i find in this new school. I felt happy, glad to be her friend and know that i can always trust in her. *sigh* Today, she is going off to Holland. Passed me some of her books that are due by Friday before she left and i gave her a feather for good luck. I shall miss her when she is gone...I really hope for a better day tomorrow man...haiz...
