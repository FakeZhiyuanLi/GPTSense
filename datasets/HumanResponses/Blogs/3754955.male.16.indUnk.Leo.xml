       Well this blog thing has been such a bitch to do, but after Line (thank you) told me to download that Hello program I think I got it under control now. So I need to get up on some posting. Umm, well nothing much has changed. But I gotta get a digicam, those things are tighttt. And I can post more pictures if I have my own camera. I have nothing to write about which is strange with all that goes on in life and whatnot, buttt. Sunday night was a funny one. Steven Mendelsohn, oh mann. That kid is hilarious, After watching our old B.A.C. movies (don't ask) I must admit, Steven is by far one of the funniest kids I've ever met and will ever meet. Quote of the night from Steven "I'm James Brophy bitch" as he kicks over 4 garbage cans. They looked at him the wrong way.  But anyways I feel like posting some pictures. I only have one though. But this picture is of a shirt that I wanted to get. Check her out. It's Ralph Luaren, and it's a nice looking polo. Perhaps I shall purchase it, and plus it may bring out my eyes.     urlLink       What a beautiful shirt&nbsp;  urlLink

        Well as you all know awhile back I had some pretty long hair. It was a little bit lower than my chin. Because I'm so funny, I thought a mullet would be kind of cool. I don't know why I'm putting this picture up because I look like a very big dirtbag (what else is new). But I'll say the reason to put it up is for your amusement. Back to the mullet, the mullet was a success. It was perfect. Thanks to HB and Caroline, but J, you might as well not try to get a career in hairstyling like Pasha. Anyways along with my mullet came popularity. My popularity was short lived though, only two days. The first day was me with my mullet, "wow your hair is cool" blah blah blah. Then the second day I got it cut and I was still popular because everyone was like "oh man why'd you cut it." After that I just became a normal face in the crowd. What I liked best about long hair was when people said I looked like a girl, then when I got it cut to a "normal" length people still said I looked like a girl. Maybe I need a sexchange. But whatever, I have a pretty good picture of the mullet though. I'm also wearing my thrift store suit. I bought the pants for a dollar and the jacket for a dollar. And yeah that suit is made in ITALYYYY. For the record, I am not at all a dirtbag. Seriously.       urlLink       Yeah, it's pretty self explanatory, but kind of a shitty pic.  &nbsp; urlLink

        I'm sure many of you have seen this many times, but hey, it's not everday you get to see our 4 sexy bodies so I decided to post it. This picture is of Skill, Grant, Steven and me at the Warped Tour 2003 in Randall's Island. AS you can see, Steve and Grant look really cool clapping there hands. Skill is the dude standing to the left of Steve. And me, well it's not hard to pick out the sexiest one there, but I'm the one chillin behind grant with the hat and red backpack on. Rock on dudee! And for the record, Split Fifty was a damn good band.     urlLink       "Yeah , woooo, Split Fifty fuckin rocks!!!" That's so gnar kill dude.&nbsp;  urlLink

        Well, this is the exact site that Caroline got her's from, the exact format as Caroline's also. If only I had some creativity and could make mine a bit different, but whatever. I was really bored tonight so I decided to make a blog. No idea how long it will last, but we'll see. Hopefully I will get some pictures put up here sometime soon for your amusement. I'm sure there can be some good ones posted.

        I saw Liz and Caroline's blog, so I was like damnnn shorty, I am going to be a trendwhore and try to give this a try. But then again I may not be able to create one because I'm " impitent " (Yeah Hogan, try I-N-C-O-M-P-I-T-E-N-T). I won't have many pictures yet but hopefully I will get some put up, so stay patient. By the way I must give credit where it's due, so Caroline sorry for ripping your exact thing, I copied yours, so, once again sorry     There are a couple of reasons I created this blog anyways and that is:  1) I was really bored tonight  2) I can chat about really stupid shit that went on in my insignificant life  3) I can post pictures  Yeah that's pretty much it. And a lot of the stuff I say is just me being a douchebag, so disreguard some of the stuff.

       I have been slacking on my posts, but it's all good.Well after our trip to Albany for our new band equipment, I realized I have nomoney left, because my cell phone bill just came in too. So $127 for the cellphone, and over 500 for the band stuff, so I gotsta keep working. Anyways, Ibought the Ampeg BA112, no one knows which one that is but that don't matter. Iwet myself when I first played this. Then me actually buying it and being ableto play it is a dream come true. What else has happened. Oh yeah, my friend toldme that when he was really drunk he took the dog food bowl from the kitchen andtook shit in it, then put it back in the kitchen. I found that funny. I also sawFahrenheit 9/11 recently. That movie is sooo fucked up, in a good way though.Everyone should go see it. Pictures will be up soon.

       Well I haven't posted because I had no acces to the internet for awhile. My sick room is in the process of being renovated, so you know. Well anyways, young Ryan Poole has let me borrow his digi cam, but the kid forgot to give me the charging cable and the one to conenct to my computer so yeah, unless I can find some cables, his camera will not be used. Anyways, today was Ironman, wow is that shit gay. I fuckin hate Ironman.&nbsp; Once I get some pictures I'll post something for everyone to enjoy. Good day.

       Man, life is way too hectic these days. I mean jamming, working, and skating, hard to balance them all out, but whatever. So I haven't posted in awhile, but das aight kid.&nbsp; Bustin (aka Justin)recently made me remember about a song that we listened to way back in the day.  The Dandy Warhols -  Heroin is so Passe.  What a good song that is, I haven't heard it in sooo long.&nbsp; It's on the list as one of the new favorites, or at least one of the songs that you listen to everyday&nbsp; until you don't like it anymore.&nbsp; So that's it for now, but I'll be posting some pictures sometime soon.  &nbsp;

       So the other night there was a good group of us hanging out. We were going to get a hotel room and shit, but yeah that failed. So Hogan and Tobin invited Steven adn myself to there house to chill with some of Tobin's college friends. I could not be happier to be invited. It's a night to remember. I don't feel like writing all of the details, so I'll just mention a few things. Everybody was drunk there, so they were all in high spirits. Went into the hot tub, damnnn. Played some drinking games. But the man of the hour was tobin's friend Paul. He was sooo drunk it was hilarious. We watched a dvd, and as he was eating his lucky charms, he was singing random songs, and sayign the slogan to the lucky chamrs commercial. It got late, about 2 in the morning and we were bored so we started fucking with him. He was asleep, koncked out practically. Then Toby waked him up "Paul, c'mon, we're going to go smoke a J" Then Paul, says no, then he gets up, knocks over several cans, goes outside, takes a piss and just walks right back into bed.&nbsp; My favorite was when we came into the room, woke Paul up and said "Paul, Paul the cops are here !!! Hurry up, put your shirt on, get dressed." What does Paul do. Well Paul decides to take his shorts off, and goes back to sleep, but rather than using his blanket, he used his wet towel from the hot tub as a blanket. Oh mann, what a night it was. College will be great.   I must be departing now because the song Stupid Kid awaits to be learned. Daniel Andriano is amazing, I must admit.

          So Hoagie Roll, Steve and I decided to go jam. Well on the ride there something unsuspected happened. Words cannot explain it, so I'd just rather show you the pictures.   &nbsp;     urlLink      A nice carride &nbsp; urlLink         urlLink      A nice blowjob &nbsp; urlLink         urlLink      Cleaning up &nbsp; urlLink        urlLink      And here's the end product &nbsp; urlLink

        What up son? I haven't done a whole lot since my last couple of posts. But you know it's not easy to live life. Well anyways, on to something mroe important, Green Day is good to listen to while you're trying to think of something cool to write for these gnarly blogs. Which brings me to the point of our band. We covered Green Day's song Warning, which surprisingly doesn't sound that bad. Maybe you guys will have the pleasure of listening to it sometime, maybe even viewing the video of it. What we're going to do is name our band " A Gay Band " and have a song called  No Friends  That way when we hit it big and we're on the radio, the DJ is going to say "And up next is A Gay Band with No Friends." Well once again, it's been a pleasure, but I have to go set up a new skateboard because I broke mine today.

        Nothing too special went on last night. Unfortunately Justin Fletcher was unable to attend this amazing night. But anyways, Hogan and I went and jammed at The Generals house, then we went up to price chopper for some doughnuts. It was 1:30 in the a.m. and as we were leaving Price Chopper we have Alex Hudson, his cousin Justin and Tyler pull up in the mini van. We hung out for a bit. It was a pretty boring night, but at least Hogan and I took some super cool pictures.      urlLink       This picture is gay. Hoagie made me put it in. Strange.&nbsp;  urlLink          Before     urlLink       yeah yeah yeah, I'm retarded and bored. What else can I say.&nbsp;  urlLink          After     urlLink       That's sooooooooooooo cool, Oh wait. &nbsp;  urlLink           urlLink       What irony? Me being Russian/Ukrainian and that sign above my head saying thank you (pronounced cpaciba)in Russian. The irony.&nbsp;  urlLink           urlLink       Hogan "The Band " Birney at work. "Good eye, sniper. I shoot, you run." For all you wondering, yes my friends, his guitar is a LES PAUL.&nbsp;  urlLink           urlLink      urlLink       Facial closeup. "Good eye sniper, I shoot you run." He's so sexyyyy &nbsp;

        I am super bored right now and I never know what to write about in these things. Maybe I will briefly write about how my day went. It wasn't too special, pertty ordinary for me. We went to Saranac Lake to skateboard. Every spot we went to we got kicked out, the shit got really old. Then back in Lake Placid, some new janitor kicked us out. He was a major ass. He asked me to read some sign that was like 20 feet away, but I couldn't so he took the liberty of reading it for me (Damn, what a nice guy) After that he was saying how he could lose his job as a janitor at a school. I know it's kind of assholish, but it's not like that job is that good anyway, and it's not my fault he became a janitor in the first place, but whatever. The guy means well, he's just trying to do his job. If I had to put up with some "pot smoking, public property destroyers" plus whatever stereotypes are associated with skateboarding, I'd probably be an asshole too.

       Well I haven't posted in awhile due to the lack of a digicam, but one of my sources said she'd hook me up with a digicam (Sank you Maggie!!!!!!) I don't have it yet, but I think sometime soon I will have it and take some pictures for your pleasure. But anyways, in the meantime, I thought I'd post something that is really irrelevant. This is going to be a long post by the way. Hogan's had songs dedicated to him,(The infamous HB song, bad newsss, very bad) so why not have a blog dedicated to him also.       HOGAN BIRNEY       urlLink       Need I say more?&nbsp;  urlLink         Hogan Birney. Much can be said about him. But nonetheless, there are many sides to Hoagie Roll. Many sides that people don't know about. For example.    Hogan "the toolman" Birney  - I believe Grant was the one who made this up. But this was when we were building Steves mini ramp and Hogan sat there pretending like he was doing something or knowing what he was doing. As Grant, Justin, Chu, and I pondered from a distance laughing at his facial exspressions and his pointlessness.    Hogan "the thong man" Birney  - Justin, Hogan and I were working at Steak and Seafood one night. A good looking girl walked in to eat dinner. As she was enjoying her food, I have Hogan come up to me and say "She's got a blue laced thong on, That shit is sooooooo hott" Justin and I being the perverts that we are decided to take a look. That was not at all a thong, but a belt. The girl was wearing a belt, nor was it laced or anything. he still argues that it was a thong, but hey what do we know.    Hogan "the cell phone/ digi-cam/ anything electronics"   Birney. As you know I got a cell phone a week or so ago. Well anyways, I was all excited to fool around with it, and put in all my contacts and whatnot But since Hogan knows everything there is to know about cell phones decided to take it from me the minute I got my phone and "set it all up" like my background, ringtones, everything. Of course I almost had a say, oh wait. Also I said I was going to buy a digital camera. Hogan, since he never buys retarded shit like that piece of shit 5-in-1 camera, mp3, picture he bought for 200 and used about once, told me not to get one unless he approved. (For the record, that 5-in-1 thing was such a piece of shit, everything about it was so terrible) "Art, you're going to get ripped off if you buy it. I know which one you should get. Let me buy it since I don't want you to get ripped off." Yeah it was all in good nature, but I mean it's not that hard to pick out a camera.    Hogan "THE BAND " Birney  . Yeah we kind of have a band, and it's finally getting off it's feet because of HOGAN BIRNEY. We're learning some songs, blah, blah, blah. After realizing that I cannot sing at all, Hoagie decides to sing. I must admit, I bow down to his singing, it is very good. Much better than myself. Anyways, one day if we have our gig, it'll be at Hogans grandpas house, blah blah blah. Since it's in his garage, the garage door is going to open while HOGAN BIRNEY plays some really radical riff on his giitar. He's a good guitarist, but he needs everyone to know that. So while he is playing and singing for that matter, showing off all of his skills, there is going to be Steve and I in the background playing our instruments, Who cares about the bassist and drummer, it's  ALL  about guitar aka HOGAN BIRNEY. Maye sometime you guys will get the pleasure of watching us play, or maybe we'll get the pleasure of you actually coming to watch us play. So wtach out for our band, but most importantly, watch out for Hogan Birney aka Our band.  Thos are just a few of his names, there are several more, but I don't feel like naming all of them.  THIS IS ALL IN GOOD FUN HOAGIE, PLEASE DON'T TAKE OFFENSE YOU KNOW WE ALL LOVE YOU

        I feel that this blog is nothing with out pictures so I might not be writing to many posts on it , but we'll see. I could post something about how my day went and whatnot, but that wouldn't be too amusing. I wish I could write like my favorite magazine writer, Dave Carnie. He can write about the most random shit and make it so interesting and hilarious. His articles were so amazing. That guy is a genius!!!!!!!!     urlLink       If only I could write like him, if only.  &nbsp; urlLink

       I found one of the coolest pictures that were ever taken of me. This is back in my prime days when I had my long hair, which I still wish I had. Although I got made fun of a lot, and called a girl just about every day, I still wish I had it. But it don't matter becasue after I cut my hair, I was stilled called a girl, and when I was working one night, some lady mistaked me for a girl, and called me "ma'am" when I am indeed a "sir". I love it when I get mistaken for the opposite sex.    urlLink     What a hottie.   urlLink

       So I've realized that I can sum up my hobbies in one picture. I tried being creative on this picture, but as you can see, it did not work at all.  My house is a mess from all the construction Pasha is doing.    urlLink     My bass and skateboarding, what a life   urlLink        Yeah, so I like to skateboard, and play bass. Those are the two big things in my life right now. Yeah, those are all my broken decks that I've collected over the years. And you gotta get the stickers all over the bass. It's the way to go. And maybe even put a little suttin suttin on the strap. Maybe like the chrimson ghost and a sessions patch.    urlLink     Gotta rock the crimson ghost on the strap   urlLink         And to top it off, gotta get a skateboarding picture, although I've put some in before. Hb took the picture of me on this one, Umm, heelflip off a ledge? This was caught and landed sooo perfectly .   urlLink     Is dat a fuckin heelfip he's throwin down? Once again, I landed this, just like my backside tailslide.   urlLink

If I were black, I'd tap dat shit.   urlLink      urlLink     Backside tailslide down that hubba, That is totally gnarly. And yeah, for the record I stuck this.   urlLink      urlLink     "Mike, Mike, we got a watch" A really cool inside joke. I fuckin hate ironman, but it's funny how I go down there anyway to support them .  urlLink
