       I was playing some  Doom3  today, and I don't know about everyone, but sending zombies from hell back to hell with a shotgun sure does beat anything else you could possibly ever do in a day.   Fuck the shotgun, you get a chainsaw.   Weapons that use bullets or shells, or anything for that matter, that you have to use from even a short distance, are for girls and gay firemen.     A real man gets his hands dirty by digging a chainsaw vertically into a screaming demon's skull.   Oh yeah the game might have a story line too.    So like yeah, after I was done being very one-thousand three-hundred thirty-seven, I get an email.  My application got accepted for Reality! I'm writing for the newspaper! I am very happy!   This is almost as much fun as  Doom , but still... c'mon,  chainsaws, people.    My day was almost perfect, except for when my aunt and the kids came to visit again for the next two weeks.  But by the time I get up, they're usually going to sleep anyway.  And I am going to wildwood for about a week tomorrow so I don't really care.   Whateverzors.    It's going to be hard to fuck up my day now.         [cutscene to sam watching his house burn down, while it starts to rain fecal matter]

      Filming Henry slam his fist into an overconfident thirteen-year-olds face, with a surge of blood erupting from the sides, I tell Dylan- Dude, this is giving me a hard on.  Dylan is laughing so hard that he can’t respond.  I’m a little baked, so I think I hear Mozart’s  Moonlight Sonata  coming out of the little kid’s mouth in the form of birdcalls.  You think to yourself,  How can this be anymore fun then a movie?   How the fuck could going to a dance or watching television all night beat watching Henry try to rip the muscle linings out of a little kid’s face?  Dylan, please, I say, hold the camera for a second so I can go behind a shadow and jerk off or hump a storm drain with steam exhaling from it.  Dylan gulps some more air down, and responds in a very, matter-of-fact look on his face-  Don’t tease me, Maverick.   You can see the outline of Henry’s back as he pile drives the little kid into a dumpster full of fiberglass or asbestos.  Henry leaps back to the twig lying on the ground, kissing it profusely.  I am getting every second of this. I have enough battery power for another two fights- three tops.  I’ll make sure to send you all copies via internet in a few days.  Let’s mail a few copies to some television networks.  MTV must be desperate without jackass.  Oh man, you can hear Henry whisper, I thought I lost you, baby. I’m so glad I have you now. I promise I’ll never let anyone come near you again.   Promise.  Forever.  I love you.    How this came about was a few days ago. Dylan and I are baked off our asses in his basement playing video games. I’m not sure what game we’re playing, but I know I just launched a grenade into a chick’s arm, and she’s running around looking for her fucked up virtual parts.  Hardcore, comments Dylan. Dylan jumps over a bunch of barrels into a machine gun turret, picking off zombies or robots, screaming through his headset, Henry’s girlfriend is going to dump him any day now- wanna get some top-grade stuff and mix him up?  I stick a mine into a zombie’s chest and kick him down an empty elevator shaft. Sure, I say. It’s always good to get someone drunk after a brake up.  I think the zombie before the mine went off.  Damn.   Who needs to talk about your problems when you can ignore them?  The headset gets a lot of static feedback as Dylan obtains a power-up. His character is now four times as big. He’s running around with a copy machine, smashing a sadist robot’s head into her torso. The robot pants, and you can here her virtually come from her spinal column braking virtually. It’s hard to tell the difference these days.  Nah man, Henry accidentally keyed my car the other day with his spike belt stud thing. Dylan blurts out, I told him not to wear that retro shit. It’s time her got a fashion lesson.  I use a pre-recorded response because I’m too busy high jacking a cruise missile.  Chhhhhh… roger that . Some times it’s just easier to say yes. This is as I chuck an aborted fetus-grenade into a bathroom’s handicap stall.   Boom.  Splatter.   Do computer programs feel pain?    Do they like it?    Dylan sticks rides an office chair down a hallway while making lead salad out of zombie-lawyers with a machine-gun. Dylan, under the crackle of gunfire asks me where I saw myself 5 years ago, in my version of the future.  How could this ever be any better then getting a shit job and buying a beat up car? How could we ever have more fun playing cat and mouse with girls than unclogging beauty queens of their brain tissue in virtual reality?  Seriously.   As I climb up a rope, dripping with napalm. The thick substance slides down and burns my hands off. Falling, I’m losing all control in my blissful paradise. I respond, I saw myself studying hard to get into a good school.   As if the future is worth something to me, anymore.   Dylan’s watching me fall through his binoculars a thousand battles away, and he asks me if I remember the first day of Junior High School.  I hated Junior High. Everyone did. That awkward, watered down quality that you got at Junior High was like doing your food shopping in a Dollar Store. It was as awkward as finding true love at a Laundromat. It was as dirty as our thoughts. It was as blinding as the refrigerator light at 3AM.  This is as I’m gunning down a hoard of mutant girl scouts with a gun that shoots nails instead of bullets.  They look like nine or seven inchers from here.  Dylan asks me if I remember that first day of Junior High where the principle told us a piece of information that would last of the rest of our metamorphic teenage lives.  Over the screams of a thousand soccer practices and dinner specials, Dylan exhales as he sticks a cross, made out of sharpened PVC pipe, into a soccer mom’s skull. You can hear her frontal lobe go squish as Dylan says, “You are going to lose some friends, and you are going to make some these next few years.”  People ask me why I’m natural in biology.  We meet outside the front door of a bunker somewhere in the purgatorial field of battle, and Dylan takes off his helmet. No offence, he tells me, you were the last person I was expecting to hang out with after that speech.  No offence taken. I thought I was going to be a lawyer or a doctor or a girl magnet back then. Back then plus five.  In the year 1999’s version of the future. Where everything is white and the tech bubble never burst.  He upholsters his .357 and puts a slug into a giant floating squid that was 2 meters from my head.  Thanks, buddy.  I love my friends.  I love my honest friends the way you love constructive criticism. I love honesty the way you love your own twisted little shit life.  Who wants to be honest and live a real life when we can so easily slip away into a computer program or television?  Honesty is a thing of the past, just like Chivalry or bloodletting.  Outdated and fucking stupid.  You’re really the anti-Christ, you know that? Dylan leans against the wall and tries to fix his sub machine gun. I look over the scorched yellow fuck-fest that we call fun and tell him it’s about control.  I was sick of being told what to do.  I was sick of good grades and flash cards and learning to apply myself. I got to the middle of my teenage life and realized I hadn’t lived any of it.  I wanted to brake off. I wanted to hang out with the kids that scare me. The kind of kids that mothers worry about.  That’s  you , Dylan.  I had to trash my life to better understand and appreciate it.  Dylan smiles as he accidentally unloads a round into his foot and says, “Thank you, I’m honored.”  I bow.  I didn’t know you could bow in this game.  Fucking crazy.  Chucking his disloyal weapon, Dylan waves the miasma of smoke away from our faces and leans in. Maybe you’re onto something, man.  What do you mean?  Maybe, Dylan gags without his gas mask; maybe we really do have to destroy something in order to make it more beautiful. The way we buy more CD’s if they’re from artists who suffer from disease or violence.  The way members of the opposite sex who have scars seem more open and able to relate to.  He pauses for a second, and you can see a mushroom cloud being reflected off of his eyeballs. This is just like when you see the two mirrors at the barber shop that stretch into infinity. You just have to replace the conceited good looks with a near-apocalyptic not-so-distant future and you’re done.  I take off my mask and tell him, go on.  The way unforeseen fate is just easier to cope with then the kind that you know is slowly coming up from behind you.  Just like that, an ameba the size of a sport utility vehicle lands on us. We’re both disarmed and the ameba is sucking the protein out of us slowly. I give it a minute and twenty seconds before we die.  Watching Dylan’s body receding and yielding to a larger force, he looks like a martyr from some east African country in a civil war.  Dylan rambles on as our brains are put on spin cycle in a huge washing machine. Maybe through destruction we can learn to build something better with our lives. Maybe after we’ve done so much pointless stuff in our lives can we only blow it all up to enjoy it a little.    Self-sacrifice, Dylan says. We aren’t that different from all those nuns and Buddhist monks that can’t see their families and can never get any licks.   His skeleton pushing against his skin, Dylan tells me that whatever doesn’t kill us can only make us stronger. Whatever doesn’t make us stronger- we can learn from.   Everything fades, and we’re in Dylan’s kitchen mixing drugs into Henry’s glass. Just your basic hallucinogens and steroids. As Dylan looks in his Chemistry textbook for a quick reference, I dump my sister’s video camera into my backpack and my dad’s car keys.  Apparently when you use enough LSD, one can mistake objects for people. So a twig we found is going to be Henrys forgiving girlfriend. We’re going to pay some kids to try and take the stick from Henry.  This could be one big illegal waste of time, but knowing Dylan, we’re going to have some real special male bonding tonight. Tonight minus five hours.

       It’s summer.  It’s summer and I’m at the beach.  I’m running.    Only in my bathing suit, my sneakers, and my sunglasses, I’m running to free myself. To hurt myself to make something better out of it. I pass cute girl after cute girl, and each time it’s love at first sight.  Each time it’s a tragic departure.  An exchange of glances. That’s all they consist of.             This is the first day I’ve gone to the beach all year, and everything is so perfect. Everything around me is perfect. Each little world I pass by, I get little splices of people’s lives.  These aren’t highlights or excerpts. These are real people talking about real topics and enjoying their day at the beach.  I run past current events. I run past political debates. I run past jocks throwing a beat up football back and fourth. I run past lovers lost within each other. I run past every little snippet of life’s fruit, as well as its discontent.  I haven’t run in weeks. My body is out of shape, but it’s hard to notice. My hair is all frizzy and hasn’t been cut in what seems like forever. I got a chance to shave this morning, so I don’t look like a complete bum.  I run back to my family and we exchange a few words before I take off my shoes, and go running after my sister and my uncle’s sister in the water admiring the seashells in the water. They look so innocent and unsuspecting as I dive at them, hurling my sweaty body at the refreshing water.   Splash.  Everything turns to blue as I lunge into the huge body of water. I’m so hot and out of breath, and my lungs begin to shrink. The cold water is adding pressure to my hot lungs. I feel like I have peanuts for organs. Up to my neck in blue, I push off and keep my head afloat. It’s so refreshing it hurts, and I try to laugh at myself.  I hang with the kids, because I love kids. Children don’t have hidden motives or unsure sexual feelings, so it feels like a true conversation to me. Talk to my uncle or his brother, and they could tell you how pretty everything is, or how satisfied they are with their white color jobs- but they’re trying to tell me how they’d love to spread that blonde with the black bikini and demolish their insides. How they can’t wait to get home to play that latest video game with the new “detachable limbs” feature.  Civilization has sterilized us of our primal instincts. Sure it looks good on the outside, but people never went on murderess rampages two-hundred years ago.  At least that’s what I’m imagining that they’re thinking of.  Hanging with the kids, talking about stupid little things like sports or tricks to pull on their teacher, my lungs start to expand and I’m thinking of nothing but simplicity. I lean back and close my eyes, and everything seems to make sense.  I’m not thinking about shoving anything down the cute girl’s tube as she walks by with her friend. I’m not thinking about how I’m going to make some cash together for my feeble little high school life. I’m not thinking about swiping a few beers later. I’m only thinking about what age I stooped playing soccer and started specializing in nothing.  We’re collecting shells, and I’m thinking about making a few for some friend’s back at home. Maybe a necklace or a bracelet will help buffer the wall of hard work that’s coming at the end of the month. I can’t believe I’m going back to fucking school next month.  There are so many shells, each unique and beautiful in their own right. They start picking some, and I make some excuse not to, but soon enough we’re making trips back to camp with handfuls. The pile grows and grows.  Soon enough I plan on at least three necklaces and one or two bracelets for my friends.  We each find about one really special shell that is so pretty and unique that it’s impossible to ignore. There is one complication though, and that is that there is a little slug still occupying it inside. The thought of hurting an animal for a stupid little necklace is so absurd, that there is no opposition when it’s thrown back into the ocean.  We build a castle. We destroy it. We go swimming. We sun bathe. Rinse and repeat. Over and over. The same cycle. It never gets boring. Each time we go out to the ocean, we bring back more and more unique shells. It’s not until the last run that I find it.  I’d been looking for a centerpiece to my special necklace all day. This shell is so perfect for the job that nothing comes close to rivalry among the others. The way that it gets thinner at the end would be a perfect place to drill a little hole. The way it would dangle and dance of the chest of any special girl would be perfect.  This is  my  shell.  It’s here that I find the stupid slug. The stupid little creature who crawled into my perfect shell. He’s way too big to fit in it, and he is half exposed. I poke him just to be sure, and of course he wiggles around.   Fuck.   You had better though that back in, my little sister tells me. It’s still alive, you know. Oh, I know. What this little fat slug doesn’t know though, I tell her, is how I have to kill him to truly make him alive.  My sister winces.   Huh?    We have to destroy something to make its true beauty shine. Who would care about the bikini islands before they got nuked? Why would people wear fur if they didn’t know it was from something alive and happy? Who would ever buy a Van Gogh if they didn’t know he shot himself?   If I have to kill this little slug in order to make a necklace that rivals god’s work in order to gain a sense of vanity, then the slug is being sacrificed for a great cause. Like those astronauts in the first Apollo missions. Like those pioneer scuba divers that never make it back up, they sacrificed their lives for photographs of such beauty and awe that it makes you rethink your life.  Maybe, I tell my family on the way home, the world is just God’s own beautiful blue shell that he gave to his special girl, and he’s taking all of eternity to destroy us so we’ll be remembered.  It’s not a wasted existence.  If the ocean starts trailing us in the rear mirror, and Neptune’s face is hurling fury and death upon us, I would have no problem crawling into a ball and waiting out my termination. I’m glad that God thinks that we are that stunning.  My Scottish family with no Melanin and lost in the day’s simplicity simply reply back with, “Aye.”  Back at home with a beer in my hand in the middle of the night, I reach into the bucket that I’ve stored our shells in on the side of the house. I pull out the shell. My own little earth. It’s purpose is small and simple, but it’s more then most people will ever get in life. It’s more then most ever get a glimpse of. I feel bad for drawling out its slow starvation and dehydration.  I polish off the rest of my beer, and fill it up with some water from the sink inside. Dumping the water into the bucket, you can see the slug move and reach to it. It’s not sure why it’s still alive, but it doesn’t seem to care.  I’m giving it a chance to enjoy a few more simple days of existence before I drill into it’s base.  I’m giving it a chance to drive three hours north to hang out with his family before a wave of spinning metal crushes it. I’m giving the shell a chance to reflect on its purpose before he is sacrificed.  It is not a wasted existence.

      Hey there you anal warts!  Oh man, you're  my  anal warts. I love you guys.  I just got back from Sean's Party- and although my cell phone got wet (I think it  might  recover) when Jon chucked me into the pool, everything was great.   Better  then great. Everything ruled. I'm so happy, but at the same time I'm   so   pissed off.  This is all because the times that we live in.  Everyone tried to relax, despite the fact that it's summer. We're  all  thinking about fucking school, though.  We're all going back. Sorry to slice the bubble.  This is our junior year.   11th grade.   We're all getting tested. We're all going to try to apply to some schools. We're all going to never see each other again.           Fuck everything.      We're all competing at the one thing that we think is good about us. We're all learning more about music theory, we're all working our asses off running six miles everyday, we're all doing binge drinking and doing horrible acts we regret to try and become a little more creative. All right, maybe that last one is just me.  Maybe.  We all need funding for college.  We need scholarships in sports or worse, disabilities.   If you love me, you'll chop off my hand or sterilize me. Please, I'd do it for you. I'm so pissed off to see all of my friends- all these kids that I love, willingly demolish themselves through physical exhaustion or sucking dick behind a desk for a better grade.   You all are worth so much more than that. You're worth more to our society then you think. We could ALL become doctors or lawyers or poets or musicians, but we're fucking caged running suicides or picking up prep classes in the summer.   Summer was  ours .  It used to be.   I remember being a kid, with Kris, and doing NOTHING all day. We'd go to my Grandma's and swim, or play video games. We had no schudule. I didn't know the fucking day of the week until I got to 7th grade.  I'm still a kid, god damnit. I'M NOT READY.  I still have so much to explore and learn.  Time to grow up? That's  bullshit .  Bullshit created by our government and education system, trying to produce workers faster and smarter then fucking China. We're still in the middle of the cold war. This terrorist stuff is just one big cover-up if you ask me. The red's are only a hop across from San Deigo. I can't wait until they're fucking 1 billion man army starts landing on Malibu Beach and turns all the Hollister into propaganda centers.   That is going to rule so hard.    If any politician doesn't think the same way that I do, then LET US GO. Let us stay in public school for another two or three years.  It couldn't hurt.  But god-forbid if Germany or Japan starts producing better then us, not like they are now, we recede into a depression again.    I'm fucking sick of organized civilization.     This is stupid. I'm bored. Nothing blows up. No drama. Only pain. I only get to see my social group spilt up and sent into the army for college money to do something better with their lives. I really don't feel like going to funerals at twenty-something. Somebody is going to go into the reserves, get called up, and they're head is going to get implode by a mortar shell in some neo-Babylon.  I still get a kick knowing Iraq was Babylon.  Think about it- in a few short years all of us will either be sucking dick in med school, trying to sell the scrap of creativity we have, or in some Masque in the middle east getting our faces owned by sniper bullets.  The future is going to suck.   When did the future switch from being a promise to becoming a threat?   This all blows.  Our school mascot is a Hawk. A noble bird, who has complete freedom.  We're more like the Council Rock South Seeds, if you ask me.  We're not learning how to fly and leaving the nest to go and conquer the world. We're being ejaculated out of a plant in some hell hole west of Manaus.  We can't control where we are going. We're spiraling downward into our progressive future.  This is why we have to cherish nights like tonight.  This is why we should learn all of this now, not in some boot camp for college money.     We're drones.  Drones in a hive.  The queen gives us orders and we follow. Squirm-squirm-dance-dance. This is the same queen who is going to order us our of hexogram cells one day. She's going to send us out into the world to conquer land for the next hive.  To destroy, to flatten, so the bigger and the better can have it.  Guess what? Our entire world is almost developed now. The habiatle parts anyway. We have no where else to go.  For now, though, none of that should concern us. We're together and we're all individuals. That's Jack, that's Amanda, that's Sean, that's Teresa, that's Jill, that's Brad, that's Ryan, that's Eugene &amp; Kris. We're all connected by who we are now, rather then our job description.  We're going to lose all of that. What I want is a way to blast our entire generation free. Blast us free of history and obligation.  I promise all of you, if I somehow do find a method to bring us all back to the stone age where the same tribe stays connected forever- I wouldn't hesitate for a  moment .     I have no problem fucking the world over for a few more good parties.

       Tonight was the first night in nine months that I was able to get to my desk without having to jump, or crawl or weave my way around piles of notebooks, without looking like a hieroglyph. This feels more like freedom then you could know.   Why it hasn’t been cleaned up, I could give you plenty of excuses. I hate excuses.    Jump back to middle school, back when I thought I still had control. I gave my English teacher at least half a dozen excuses in twenty minutes to why I hadn’t circled all the verbs in a story I was given. After my through scalding in front of the entire class which also had my first girlfriend in it, I made up more excuses of why I hated my teacher so much.   Pulling out a year-old paper from my old notebooks and trying to eye some grey hairs on my mom, I listen to my little cousin ramble on about computer games. I try to hide my grin, because he sounds almost exactly like me from a few years ago.   My mother’s been busy. Too busy to help me or even bother to yell at me for the bombshell that is an excuse for my bedroom. I’m not whining because she has been through a lot, and even after all the screaming and fighting that happened about two hours ago, I’m still not angry at her. I should be angry at myself or some bullshit like that. Any therapist will tell you that bottled up anger can damage a person's health. “Damage,” or in other words, bring you’re hunting rifle to the top of the school and start picking off Emo’s. I wish I had the balls to do that, but the truth is I haven’t touched my rifle in about nine months, except for a Sunday in May when I cleaned it out.   By busy, I mean my mother’s been driving my grandmother to and from chemotherapy or chemotherapy checkups. This is in-between my sisters physical therapy, because my sister has Cerebral Palsy. This is also in-between driving me to summer school, friend’s houses, and bass lessons. Shit, that reminds me, I still haven’t touched the damn thing. I haven’t fucking picked it up all week. I haven’t sat down and jammed in what seems like years, but it’s probably around nine months. And I used to be such a good kid.   Seriously, whenever they ask you in health class who is your idol, I say, my mother. Everyone, and even the girls, say their father or some celebrity. If I sat down and read a book about finding out people’s past lives, I’m almost fucking certain that mom would be either a be a scotch drinking general or a wine drinking, bread braking martyr.  Mom, for the first time in almost a year, is helping me clean out my room. Why it’s so dirty, she isn’t sure. Probably because she can’t ask because it’s lost in her brain, next to Grandma’s reallyreallylongtumorname and my GPA. Maybe she does know, but if she did, I’d probably be in a therapist’s office or something she’d make time to take me too.  She opens up my sliding closet door and right off the bat, she asks, “What is my cooler doing here?” Oh shit. I know this routine. I already know the whole story, where the plot twists are and everything, even before it has begun. I make up some excuses, subtlety hinting that my little thirteen-year-old cousin, Donald, should exit the room. He picks up in it quick, and I’m glad because I like him so much. I didn’t want him anywhere near the fallout of the explosion that’s going to erupt any moment now.  After my cousin leaves, Mom sends the international warning sign for “What the FUCK?” Her skin, starting to wrinkle, her hair, probably graying under layers of dye, her hands, weak and white knuckled; under all of this, is a brain that’s frying itself with disappointment and rage. That could be my brain too.  Under the flames and cracking sounds that my brain is making. Under the flat, grinding sounds a hard drive makes when it starts to really spin up, I smile. My mother is about as confused as black man in my neighborhood. I smile some more, and wait to hear my cousin’s voice fade until I know he’s out of the house.  Quarantined.  Contained.  Locked Down.  Safe.    I get discouraged because I remember how I got my cousin out of the room. Pointless excuses. Yeah, dude, check up on the Air Conditioning filter, and see if it’s still on. I don’t remember what I used, but I’m sure it was something of that caliber.  Christ I hate when I bullshit. Everyone knows it and I feel terrible afterwards. As if excuses have gotten me anywhere these last nine months.  As if I amounted to anything.  Before she can question more, I lean against my dresser and think back to the first time I got wasted. Everything slows down, the way it does when you take too many serotonin pills or when you drink so much that you’ll experience a kind of slowness, like a lag in a first-person-shooter, or when you launch miniature versions of yourself during an orgasm. Life is really just a bunch of uppers or downers. It was the first of November.   We’re at Tom’s. The Triad. Tom, Philip, and I. I can just see us all signing up for the next world war together. The first one to get killed would probably be Phillip. We talked this over.  This isn’t the first time I’ve drank. We’ve been at it since middle school. Drinking because media and church groups telling us how bad it is. Well, we were bad, in the current situation’s standards. Drinking, listening to loud, Satan approved rock music, and in our underwear, and not doing our homework. And I used to be such a good kid.   No sticker on any album ever warns you that you might already be slowly dieing from listening to it with a combination of drinking and bad grades. They really should.   The point being, there is, in fact a level under badass. A level no teenager, or aspiring artist, or suburbanized eunuch is ever warned about. School doesn’t tell you because they know that a couple kids in the building every year eventually do hit bottom. Parents don’t even bother because they know it’ll never happen to their kid. Why would God let their son get like that, when they already have a tumor for a senile mother and a daughter who has Cerebral Palsy? I mean, their son has already survived car accidents and bad grades and ski accidents that make their insurance higher then the cost of buying their own personal paramedic. God just isn’t that cruel.     God used to be such a nice guy, right?   In Tom’s basement, listing to disco records, trying to piece together our own parent’s generation understanding of life, as if cheating is getting us anywhere, we’re all drinking and partying.   Tom’s basement has a little swing door that is meant to fix pipes if they ever have a leak. A small crawl space no deeper than two, two and half feet tops- exist between a sense of twisted accomplishment and the real world. We’ve been chucking our empty bottles down there for what seems like forever, but it’s actually just been the last three years.   We’ve lost about half a dozen lighters down that crawl space. One gets satisfaction from looking at that, even if it’s only for a brief second before the lighter starts to cook your thumb. This makes you think back to when you were a kid, and you’d spend dry winter days inside building goliath castles and spaceships with Lego’s, each with precise and noticeable details. This wasn’t the kind of accomplishment you’d get prepackaged with directions and men. This was something that held no blueprint, and you had to recruit people to build it with you.   If you made a cross section chart of the bottles, you’d find Gatorade bottles on the bottom, from the childhood era, where we thought we were still capable of doing something great with our lives. Next you have the seventh and eighth grade, where we thought we were so rebellious and smart; you’ll find a few cheap beers. Work your way up to high school, and you have the experimental age, with hard liquor and a few broken shards of a shot glass. What you’ll find nine months from now is a bottle of vodka I polished off myself with a note inside.  An autograph from yours truly.  No Photos, please- I haven’t bathed in days.  Yes, I’m back on my feet. Or at least that’s what my agent’s told me to tell you.   Looking at the imaginary cross section, I see a bunch of paleontologists humping over each other, each trying to make the best hypothesis to who we were and where we came from. “Working your way from the bottom, one scientist observes, here, you can see the pillars of their ideology.” He continues on, “You can see a celebration here, he notes, where the tribe discovered faster, and more efficient methods of delivering the alcohol.”   Then he steps back, the way people step back from a car accident trying to find where the last chunk of the brain is, and end up spending all day trying to find it, because it makes more sense to look for pink goo then to go to work or school to make something out of your life.   Still confused and in much need of a nice, smooth snifter of brandy, he reaches the crust of the ancient tribe-civilization-thing and says “this must be where their holocaust happened.”   I snap to, and Philip is holding me up in the air, flaunting his untapped power that the drink gave him the keys too, holding all one hundred and thirty pounds of me, three feet in the air. Needless to say, he’s a lot bigger than me, and can hold a lot of liquor. Something I found out later that night, making a Taiwanese whore house out of Tom’s toilet. You’re the best man, thanks for letting me spend the night, I said in slur of barley audible English.    Nigga, he says, what da FUCK are you smokin? I tell him that I was looking for clues to the past- to now, the present. Even more confused and probably a little drunk, he tells me that it’d be best to shut the fuck up and do another line of blow with him.   We like talk ghetto because Tom brought up the point that we could yell racist slurs all day where we live and never fear getting in any sort of trouble because, honestly, there are no black people in suburbia. What a fun night that was with the two of them.   Tom has aviators on, and is on a barstool with his fly unbuttoned on his boxers and he’s pretending to bomb Hiroshima. This would be completely realistic if his dick wasn’t hanging out and I'm sure bomber chairs don't spin all the way around.   Maybe, you think, they were drunk. Maybe, you think, they were jerking off. You can only level a modern city and blow some sperm once in a lifetime.   Listening to the Boogie Nights soundtrack we go back to dancing and looking for relics to our parents past. Looking for their naked cross section of cumulative failure. I’m still looking for something to compare my problems too make them seem more distant and less personal.  Less of my problem.  Less me.  My life’s server jumps a little bit, and I whisper the word into my imaginary headset- LAG. This is in the middle of the last school year. This is like four or five months ago. I’m playing computer games, next to my sealed backpack, plugged in.   I’m afraid to leave the one place I have control of. I’m deadly afraid to become exposed and weak. When I’m in a game, on the top of a pile of rotting carcasses, I feel alive. When the steam from your minigun is scorching your face and the wind is blowing your wild sun-bleached hair in a thousand different directions, somebody might mistake you for a Norse god. I can almost hear the Valkyrie’s hymns from down here on a battlefield.   This isn’t me.  That’s what I love about it.  And I used to be a real kid, too.  My pants are still unzipped from the last time masturbated, which was hours ago. Mom would scream and flip out if she saw, but she gets home around six or seven every night now from somebody’s doctor or a quick stop at church. As if God has anything to offer anymore.  He used to be on the ball, right?  Download a few weeks before this; I replaced all the copies of my church’s bibles with copies of A Brief History of Time with my friend, Dylan. The church never even mentioned the incident, because even the pope himself might shrug once in a while and say yeah, our religion might not be the right one. We don’t have anything to offer more than the next guy, but we unified the west, so suck my cock. It’s an admirable organization, but I still want to lunge out at something.  An excuse.  Something to make my problems seem less personal.  Less real.  Less me.  And I used to be such a good kid.  It my basement, with me screaming at the headset half because my teammate just put a .45 in my head by accident, half because I banged my head on the desk trying to pull my pants up from my other addiction, half because I’ve hit bottom but don’t have the guts to admit it. I’m pulling up my pants not because I should work on my studies because I want to make something out of myself. I’m pulling them up because I can hear the pitter-patter of footsteps coming down the stairs to my two o’clock. This is my little cousin, and he’s twelve-years-old here.   I love this kid. He has this fascination with me. He looks up to me the same way I did to my old neighbor, Matt, when I was a kid. I modeled my style after my neighbor because at that point in time, I practically didn’t exist. I used to imagine more adventures then the ones I actually had with Matt.   Here is information evolution in the fifth gear. Music, fashion, sports, even what video game console to purchase is all dictated by this lost soul. This creature that takes over teenager’s lives and moves on to find another prey.    And here I am, trying to blame my problems on imaginary creatures. And I used to be such a good kid.   For Donald’s twelfth birthday, my uncle and I collected money from everyone in our family and built him a gaming computer anyone remotely familiar with PC’s would admire. For my gift, I got him a copy of Half-Life.    Why I did it, it was some vague example of brotherly love. Philadelphia. This is my life, and I want you to enjoy it too.    The real reason I bought him that game was another twisted soul to drag into my hole of a personality. This was the full circle of my neighbor’s life to mine to his. I was passing on the final driver for failure. Keeping the black torch’s flame alive and healthy.  “Healthy” seems like an oxymoron now.  Skipping the bumps on my life’s disk, I think back to the day I got my Saga Genesis. It’s Christmas Eve and I’m still reticent and naive. Matt showed up. Everyone loved Matt. I was in love with the fact one day I’d be like him.  And, to believe, I used to be my own person.  To send off the devil that’s been in his head since he first got it probably playing Atari somewhere, he came over to deliver his gift. His black flame.   Merry Christmas, little dude, he says. I see his red-haired girlfriend behind him smiling not out of love but probably the fact that they were going to go fuck and try to have their own kid that night. I look from the red and green package to his skinny but god like hand to his girlfriend’s white smile, and just from the weight of the box that I’ve felt a thousand times at his house, I know the story even before it starts.  All the plot twists.  How many pages are in each chapter.  The aspiring artist always gets killed.  I don’t fit into the victims, I see myself as more of an observer mainly because I still have a six pack of Guinness Draught in the mini-fridge I’ve been meaning to get to.  My family still has a few laughs about how quickly I pieced the surprise together. I ripped off the paper and then shot to my mom, pregnant with my damaged sister next to grandma, lighting up another cigarette. She nods to the basement door, and I’m down there in a flash.  About halfway down there, I run back to my neighbor, and hug his leg. Realizing years later that I probably smashed the poor guy’s balls in, I thank him. Thank you so much, I say. Thank you for everything. He’ll never know how much he gave to me.    I’ll never need another sugary treat or sports equipment for the rest of eternity. I’ll never have to wait at the DMV for four hours to get my Driver’s Licensee. I’ll never have to worry about college or school.   It’s kind of funny how our happiest moments reflect our worst.   It’s almost kind of cool how we put up this invisible security blanket of good memories in our moments of unhappiness or pain or near death. And yes, I’ve been to all of those places, and I’d thank god for the good memories that protect me from a bordering insanity if I weren’t so fucking pissed off at him.   Jump back to seeing my cousin, standing in my basement, trying to avoid looking at my undone pants and the wires wrapping around my body that stinks of whiskey, he asks me if I want to play some Counter-Strike tonight. Just a few rounds, he says. It’s already six or seven at night and I see him as more of a nine o’clock kid.    In the background you can hear a Terrorist blow my brains out, and that adds up to about my sixtieth death in that level alone. That’s how much I was playing. This is how much control I had of my life.   My cousin, looking incredibly timid like the way you look at a corpse or more like a corpse who’s under the heap of less white skin humping its rotting brains out. You’re first instinct is to simply turn around and ask the next person whose problems and addictions aren’t on the surface. Whose problems don’t include the following: alcoholism, sex addiction, bad grades, depleting social life, personal conflicts with God. I always imagined God as an awesome drinking buddy. I can imagine him hammered off his ass and telling me that the Missis and him got a little to frisky in Rio one night. One thing led to another and Humanity got blown out of some hot angel that god boned nine months later.   Sorry to disappoint you, God says stinking of red wine, but Earth is the sewers of the universe. Suburbia isn’t as bad, it’s like the storm drain, he tells me. Just shut up and try not to forget about me at the apocalypse, which is right around the corner.   My cousin, he says in his little whimper of a voice a lot like mine used to sound, asks if I want to play a little counter-strike that night. When I think of night, I’m thinking 1 am, because I like to play right after my midnight drink n jerk. He still goes to school everyday, I remind myself. He still has a life and a future and riches ahead of him, I remind myself. He’s still alive. I don’t want to ruin his life for him. It’s so much more fun to watch somebody do it to themselves. It’s the kind of laughter you get from watching a person willingly get shot out of a cannon or when people have heart attacks at eating contests.  He’s still alive the way I haven’t felt like that night at Tom’s in November.   I’m on my cell phone, typing out the words, I love you, to my girlfriend. Samantha. I still think of her every few nights. I remember her because she’s the one who dragged me into the hole I like to call hitting suburban bottom.   How she typed a message on a phone so quickly and articulately, she must have had it written out for a while. She was actually planning to dump me over a cell phone message. Jesus Fucking Christ that still gets to me. This is High School, I tell myself. We’re supposed to be adults. That’s the bullshit I’m fed everyday, anyway.   I start flipping out, and right away, I have my own plan stored in Tom’s cabinet. I hear Philip make some backhanded comment to Tom, and they play the I told you so game that they know has pissed me off since we were in the third grade.   My contingence of postponing my own pandemonium is in the bottle, the place the horror stories of broken families and great artists wrote about. I know all the passwords to all the doors without even having to ask for directions. I’m predestined to fuck up.   Tom and his Russian parents with their smooth Russian vodka, I pour everyone a shot. They think it’s kind of funny. I thought it was too.   Staring into the Vodka that I could have sworn was water, that I could have sworn would save me from my problems, how could I have known?  Jesus, isn’t this your job? Where is that fucking compassion? It would be great right about now.  Even now, every time I’m at a party, I like to take at least one shot of vodka, and every time I do, I can taste Samantha.   On my second shot of vodka, I taste the unity of Tom, Philip, and I, and how they’ll stick with me when I eventually tell them I’m a raging alcoholic. I still don’t think I am, but like I said, I can’t accept the fact that I have the biggest self-induced problem of anyone I know. I’ll get over it, eventually.   Third shot, I like to think of where my life is going.  Fourth, I like to forget.   Still though, I like to think that because of Sam, my life is a wreck. Sam’s headed towards Ivy League. No exaggeration. I’m dead sure of it. Everyone else is, too. She was smart and cute but most of all, she cared about my work and always comforted me when I needed it. Which I did, everyone does.   She used to make me feel smart by comparison.    As if I have anything real and valuable to contribute to the world.       As If amounting to something could solve anything.       It took her about two or three months to be able to brake up with me. It’s hard to brake up with a guy whose life is a hole of disappointment, I imagine.   Even with all the hospital visits and trips to flower shop for the small but elite group of sick people I know, I still get pissed off because she broke up with me over a fucking text message on a screen three inches big. I’m the most selfish one I could ever meet, or at least that’s what I was. I haven’t heard from Sam in nine months. I was the kind of nice kid who used to walk girls to their doors after every date, even if we fought.   For the past nine months, I haven’t lived. I’ve been in a comatose state. As soon as I was out of a bottle or pornography website or computer program, I feel back into another. I remember looking at clocks when my Mom would come home from her second job or the pharmacy, and thinking, Christ, where have the last five hours gone?   For the past nine months, I haven’t been out of a drink or x-rated movie or a round of counter-strike long enough to do any homework or study. I find myself relating to over-achievers in my school who haven’t slept enough because they were volunteering at the hospital, while I suck up their time and talent without a reason to live or progress or evolve. I used to help other kids study, that’s the kind of compassion I showed for my common man.   I haven’t gotten a mark on any test or report card for the past nine months higher then a “C.” I dropped a few courses and failed one, which is why I have to get up in four hours to get to summer school. This is before mom drives my sister to physical therapy. I used to help my sister with her exercises to help strengthen her demented muscles and twisted sprit, that’s the love I used to show for my sister.   Trapped in my self absorbent bubble of excuses and bad grades and drinking and sex addiction and video games, I stopped caring about anything.  That was the beauty of it.  I stopped living.  In a sense, I’ve been dead for the better half of the last year now.  I don’t care about the war, or which celebrity is having a fuckfest with a street bum. I don’t care about children’s rights, and I especially could give no shit about abortion either. The great part about being an addict and a waste is you stop worrying when the last time you got a haircut was or if you’ve worn the same pair of blue jeans for the past six days.   Stumble to last weekend, where you can find the three of us, Philip, Tom, and me, at it again. This is my problem that I’ve dragged them into. Thank the unfair God that it hasn’t gotten to them yet. They’re not taking hits during the day just to stay awake. Not yet, anyway, depending on how much we go though tonight.   This is the same routine we’ve been at for a very long time now. We’re drunk and Tom has a now half broken pair of aviators on and he’s bombing Nagasaki. He’s wearing white underwear , so his penis isn’t out and collecting gamma rays from any horrible weapon of mass destruction. I should go kick him off that damn chair if I was a little more coordinated.   Once Tom and Philip drank themselves to sleep, I take the Vodka bottle upstairs to Tom’s clean white kitchen, spilling some liquid failure every few inches. I find my way to a pen and paper next to his phone. I polish it off.   In cute little script, the word “Message” floats translucently above the rest of the bleach white pad. I write “I am abandoning my ties to anything remotely human. I am sick of searching for something to occupy my being. I am going to try and survive without my personality. If I don’t do something with my life and you’re reading this note, add it to your museum of natural history with the description of ‘suck my wasted life’s dick.’”   I don’t need Matt any more. Matt is probably on his second or third kid by now. He probably has a degree in something meaningful. His wife’s teeth are probably starting to shade yellow, and he probably loves her just as much or more.  He probably found God, somewhere.  Probably somewhere I haven’t looked because it doesn’t have a trail of shot glasses or pornography.  And maybe God isn’t so forgiving. Maybe he’s more of a teacher then a ruler. Maybe he’s trying to teach me how once you get the chance to brake up you’re life you have an excellent chance to rebuild it anyway you want. I write all of this on this little napkin-cocktail thing.   Maybe being an addict to so many things, God knew I’d eventually crash. Maybe he’s not out to judge us after all. God is just an observer. He’s watching the game on the television in the bar surrounded by the color white and a ton of fluffy things. Or maybe it’s something else. I’m writing this down in the early hours of sunlight. It must be around five or six.  Thank you for fucking up my life, God. Now that I don’t have Matt to follow blindly anymore. God’s horrible intervention has saved me from doing something boring and ordinary with my life. I could be way off on this one, I scribble as bits of saliva trickle off my lips, but maybe God being such a douche bag can inspire us to do great things.  I fold the note in half.  I write “Matt” on the front of the fold.  I roll him up like a SOS from the Spanish expansion.  I’m still pissed off at God, but not that pissed off anymore.  Wrapping the note and placing the genie in his bottle, I release him into his own mansion of numbness and into his own personal coma which will last until the day Tom’s pipes burst and the plumber finds a mountain of fossils. In this distant future I imagine, I can see the paleontologists over the note. I feel bad for the lives I might wreck, but that’s their problem.  That’s their chance to make something out of themselves other then a good salary and a Christmas bonus.   Jump to this afternoon, with my mom holding back the tears of one more problem that she needs to baby-sit. I sit her down. With Donald out of the room, I can finally breathe clear. Telling her everything, I know the creature that’s been jumping for generation after generation, to one troubled person to another, is dieing under the words of my revelation.    I shut the door and lock it, my mother staring at the giant Milky Way poster I have, she unfocused, and is able to look at the whole picture.    Mom, I say. I’m sick of consuming and destroying. I’m sick of watching people die and I’m sick of being one of them. The only thing I want to do now, I tell her, is to create and build and proliferate. Why I want to, it’s not because I owe society or God shit, it’s because of her. That because of her determination’s reflection to live, I want to mimic it- to fill the gap Matt left in me. I want to mimic her for at least the next decade, if she wouldn’t mind.    Mom begins to cry, and I bring her down to my chest, and I pat her and rub her back, telling her; thank you. Thank you for this mom. I love you, and I’m sorry.  Thank you.    That moment, that exact moment in time, I’ll never forget. Because, for the first time in nine months, I feel good. This is my rebirth. I’m no longer myself anymore, and I can feel the layers of personality and habits I used to know disappear under their own folds within my mind.    This is the first time in nine months where I can honestly say, that I’m a kid doing a good act. And maybe I’ll never really get a chance to build anything with my life, but sitting in the rubble of my wasted teenage years, I think,  I’m sure enough piled dust can still make an impression on the world.

      Kris and Eugene came over last night and we played a lot of video games and we also went to see  Collateral .  That movie was pretty cool.  Best ending ever.   Not as good as an ending compared to a movie like  Seven , but still pretty good.  I got a job this morning so I got up at around nine this morning. That was good. I made some much needed money.  I swear, a heroin addict spends money slower then I do, and I don't even buy anything useful.   I am waste.  I am trash.  I am trash. I am trash and shit and crazy to you and this whole fucking world. You don't care where live or how I feel, or what I eat or how I feed my kids or how I pay the doctor if I get sick, and yes I am stupid and bored and weak, but I am still your responsibility.   I told that to my mom at breakfast when she asked me why I was wearing sun glasses and a bathrobe.   Blue bathroom   +   blue shades  =  L337 ,  right?    Yeah so, I had a dream last night I was eating glass out of a bowel with a serving spoon. Then I told my Grandma that I wasn't feeling to good, and she's like well then vomit it out, you human butt wipe.  So like I tried sticking my fingers in my mouth but I couldn't do it right- I'd only spend five minutes at a time staring at my fingers after I tried to puke.  Grandma was like  OMFG, SAM . So she stuffed her fingers down and BAM, i vomited all over the place.  Then I look down, and what do you know- DIAMONDS.  So like my grandma was all like  w00t!   Then I woke up and my anus hurt.  I'm going to go get some pants on. It's too cold in my house.

      Watching this girl, who hasn’t gotten a good night’s rest in a week at this god-forsaken camp, tears running down her face, smeared in make-up and shame, I try to imagine her legs spread across my bed back at home. That’s the first thing I think about.  The second thing I think is how fortunate it is of a thing that she started braking down, almost on que. This stalls the envoy of salvation that’s been traveling around the conference room for the last half hour. We’re almost at forty-five minutes, which is spilt time.  There is the clergy, marching around the room to different tables. Shining Christ’s love onto each and every believer. Saving each soul, one at a time. Everyone’s got their pasty yellow tickets into heaven with an expected ten-minute wait.  Oh yeah, welcome to Camp Salvation. This is where the gentiles convert the heathens. There is absolute nothing to fear here except for the fact that about two or three hundred bible thumpers are ready to pound my sinful ass.  I spot Dylan in the corner of my eye, and he gives me this look that says, “SOS.” He doesn’t look angry or impatient. Dylan is more human then ever here. He is scared. He is scared shitless and so am I.  The shameful girl full of mascara and woe, they have her on her knees now. I move a couple images around in my head, except for her body position. This is that part where the cameraman is supposed to get a close up of your shoulders with the two creatures chilling up top objectively pointing out each aspect of the problem. I hold my breathe and try to listen to what my mind thinks I should do, but all I can think about is that purple… crimson color those girls knees are right now, and how awesome they would look on my hardwood floor.  I’m evil and I can deal with that. I wouldn’t label Dylan and I evil, but we are sinners. We had talked about this last night. Last night with the blanket of stars and the cold mountain air. Jesus, I had said, I love it up here. The whole human thing, I also commented, the whole brainwashing salvation deal that they’ve got going on kind of thins the beauty of everything. Dylan looks at the hole in his beer and swishes it around a bit before saying, “That’s what’s the beer is for man, helps you un-think all the worldly possessions we are supposed to be attached to. All those neural synapses and endorphins we call feelings are just… complications if you ask me.”  I’m not asking you Dylan.  Christ, how did we get here?  “Careful, Dylan tells me, the mountain has ears.”  And we laugh, together, for what seems like a long time.  I take another sip of the beer, and say “Whatever, man.”  The girl went away to wash off her shame by now. By the time I snap out of my little stupor of a hallucination because nobody has slept this whole week, everyone is looking at me. Everyone has their hands folded, like they are about receive an axe to the neck. And me, I spaced out again. They ask me if I’ve accepted Christ as my personal savoir. And I feel a hand tug on my arm. Smooth, delicate, features that remind me why I’m here. Alison. That stupid little cunt-bag that teased me into deliverance. Alison. I had tried to bang her last night. She whined about abstinence and forgiveness and Africa missionary work… stuff that reminded me of different drugs and sexual positions.   Dylan with his half-empty beer and his big red sweatshirt… he tells me that if they get to him, and they try to convert him, he wants me to pull the plug. I ask what he means by “pull the plug.” Dylan tells me to run into the basement of the meeting hall where they hold the inquisitions, and flip the circuit breaker. I tell him that they won’t like it, and he gives me a spot to meet him at after the blackout.  We’re so tired and a little drunk that running away from a christen teen concentration camp seems like the perfect solution to get back home as soon as possible to avoid Christ’s forgiveness and play some video games.  Dylan opening another beer looks at the stars and tells me that it’s just plain old selfish. That we sacrifice our entire lives for some… phantom that was more then likely cobbled together from the backs of biblical cereal boxes. “We sacrifice more than our dedication and time, Dylan tells me, we sacrifice our ideals and morals for the church’s.”  I take another sip of the beer, and say “Whatever, man.”  I clench Alison’s open palm and put on this look that says, “Help me help myself.” Looking right into the guys face, I tell him that I have yet to wield the power of Christ’s all-forgiving love. I get the reaction I’m looking for. I tell them I’m ready to pull the plug on Satan and his filthily habits.   I notice Dylan excuse himself on the word “pull.” The hard-on I was feeding off of Alison quickly shoots back down into my pants because my Adrenal glands have just licked their lips and they are ready to blow.  I can hear Dylan in the back of my head, ranting as usual. Dylan tells me that he never wants to be saved. Salvation, he says, shouldn’t have to be a goddamn obligation. Dylan on his fifth or sixth beer tells me that without sin, what would we have? Dylan shifts his weight and almost stumbles, but manages to get out the word “…nothing.” Sin is the fuel of our species, Dylan tells me. If we don’t break a few rules and conquer a little vagina here and there, we wouldn’t have any need for law or the military or even school. Without wrong doing we can never be caught. Without wrongdoing we are all the same generic cola in nonbiodegradable cups. We need to fuck stuff up once in a while to keep the earth spinning.”  “Would you say this night was uneventful, my friend?”  I don’t know Dylan, I’m drunk and I want to get some rest.  “Answer the fucking question, man. Have we done anything interesting tonight?”  No, Dylan, we haven’t.  “BUT… but, have we done anything wrong?”  No, Dylan, we follow the rules and nobody gets hurt.  “Well fuck them, I say we make this night memorable. I say we keep the earth spinning.”  I ask Dylan what he’s talking about.  “This.”  Just like that he polishes off his beer, and chucks the bottle into a fucking window down the row of generic blue housing. I jump and pull up the hood on my sweatshirt. I’m already reacting. I don’t think, I do. It feels kind of… good. I start to toss our bottles around, but Dylan grabs the last one, and tells me to throw it. “Sin already, they’re going to be pissed off when they find out we’re hurling shit.”   Dylan with his drunken smile, and his candy-ass hairstyle, I want to put a .50 in his forehead. I just start to jog away, but Dylan won’t leave. He just stands there, tossing the bottle up and down in the palm of his hand like a baseball. “Don’t tell me your brother-in-law is an angel or something and will know that we did this.”   No excuses. No distractions. I’m at the precipice of enlightenment.  I grab the bottle out of his hand, and say “Whatever, man.”  I chuck it, and I hear it smash, and it feels good.  I can feel the neural synapse. I can feel the peptide phenylthylamine rush into my blood stream. For a second, we aren’t thinking. We’re just doing.  All of this… these memory replays, are just the background static of my brain. My cortex and cerebrum are off somewhere, and it feels like my stem is the only part actually interacting with the rest of the real world.   I’m on my knees now. I look up and the inquisition has me caged in. They’ve formed a circle around me. Alison and I are the only ones in the circle, and she puts her warm, curved palm on the side of my face, and rubs it.   I’d smile but my cerebrum says, “You’re scared right now.” I am.  Here we are, Alison and I. What I’ve dreamt of for months. She’s the queen and I’m her knight. Flash back a few hundred years and this would seem all too familiar, but it doesn’t. Me with my eccentric layers of faith and body armor, it’s actually a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt that has a drawing of a sponge. All of that doesn’t matter though.  I part my arms, holding the warmth of the bright ceiling lights. I whisper, “Save me.” The circle closes a little, and the lights dim. The warmth fleets a little. Alison’s grip on my face tightens.  I clench the muscles in my face, and when some of the skin overlaps, I think of those old sailors with their wind-hardened faces that remind of you of stretched leather on a jacket or on a steering wheel or those eighty year old Indian medicine men. I berate in deep. I inhale. I gasp out the words, “Save me.” I can sense the circle’s feet touching mine. Alison brings my face to her belly because she thinks I might cry. I might have. I don’t know, nobody had gotten any sleep that weekend and nothing makes sense at a point.  I start to chant it like a song. “Save Me.” Save me from sin and a life that I’m doomed to fail at anyway. Save me from bad grades and satanic atheist teachers. Deliver me, if you will, from Swedish death metal and Junior Prom. Rip me out of my comfortable lifestyle to replace it with a sense of substance. SAVE ME, ALREADY. The circle closes tightly and I’m pushed into Alison’s abdomen. I wrap my arms around her body, and the first thing that I can think of is what I would do to her if I wasn’t getting delivered from sin. She buys into all of it. I think I am too. Getting on her knees and wrapping her arms around my head, she tells me everything is OK, and not to worry about anything.  I meet her gaze, and she tries to let go, but I’m holding her too tightly. Alison knows that look I’m giving her. That look that people have before the roller coaster goes down that first hill. That look that astronaughts give to the camera inside the cockpit around T-minus five seconds. That look that says I’m scared and I’m ready to have a blast at the same time.  Whatever.  Fucking A.  On our run back last night, Dylan looked like one of those caveman drawings you see in Biology textbooks. He’s got his weird hump to his walk. His head is low like the zenith above is going to come crashing down any second.   I guess even best guy friends slash revolutionaries can be scared once in a while. I guess that’s what he wants to do to himself.   Dylan tells me that people are always telling us that uncertainty is the worst feeling we can have. Dylan with his caveman dance says that if God does exist, he certainly isn’t following a game plan because nothing makes sense in the world, and that’s what makes it so amazing and beautiful. We are the control freaks of the world, Dylan whispers to me while you can hear ministers cursing a few dozen yards behind us. “The United States is so afraid of the unknown we invest money and troops to every hotspot of the world. We’re not angels; those Old Testament angels with the legions of holy warriors purging entire cities just because they have anal sex. We’re not god’s personal hit man and I for one am certainly not apart of the plague that’s strengthening a moral blanket that makes cups that aren’t biodegradable.”   We’ve just all got to learn to let go once in a while, he adds. We have to learn to let go by blowing something up once in a while, and he tells me there is no shame in that.  I laugh really hard and say “Whatever, man.”  I snap back, and I’m screaming it now. “SALVATION!” I scream that I demand sanctuary from a society that tries to steal my faith. I tell them I don’t have a god because I want to find him on my own, if I can find him. Everyone’s looking at me. The ceiling lights are burning my flesh. The circle is wide enough for me to dive through an opening if I needed to.  Which I need to, in about T-whatever seconds.  Alison’s mouth is open, and just like that; I hear a deep, load, and scratchy scream down the stairwell to my 2 o’clock. It’s Dylan. Either Dylan is charging Fort Wagner to restore the south’s glory or he’s showing me that the wrong thing might be the right thing for once. Dylan’s cutting the lights.  I smile and flash, everyone’s been isolated. I have that weird negative imagine burned into my cornea of Alison’s shocked expression and her open mouth. I lunge into the hole, and soon enough my tongue in jammed down her thought, and we’re sucking each other’s faces in. We’re grabbing at each other like primitive cavemen, and it feels good.  I push off of Alison.  I run.  I run out of the negative hole the circle left open, and I just close my eyes and feel my way out to the door. Everyone’s screaming and some kids are making weird hooting sounds.  I start sprinting as soon as I make it to the door, and I see a weird shape that looks a lot like Dylan. He’s waving to me, as old maple trees obscure the view a little and I can see him mouth the words, “That was fun.” I make a fist and everything feels good.  Dylan and I just kept running away. We ran for as long as we felt that we needed to. We’re still running. I’m so tired and hungry and deprived of oxygen that my brain doesn’t really think, it just does and what I’m doing is running.  For once in my life, nothing exists except Dylan’s blurb of a person and the cold mountain wilderness.  For once, everything makes sense.  Everything makes sense, and where we’re going from here who knows.  We just kept running from salvation, and where we will end up doesn’t really matter.

      I went to DC for the weekend with my family. Caitlin had never been there, or maybe she did and didn't remember anything- but like yeah, it was all good.  I went to all the memorials with them, then I spilt up and went to the holocaust museum with this British guy I met along the way named Henry. Funny dude.  Except it's hard to be funny in the holocaust museum. You get the idea.  So we went out for food later that night, and I could have had a normal meal. I could have had a burger or even a salad or some soup.  But NO. I'm a jackass. I had to act like a qusdo-intellectual prick and order some ultra spicy raw sushi.  Flash to 5 AM with me over the hotel toilet vomiting my intestine out. I called my dad in, but he's like-  SAM, STFU.    I love my family.   I figure this is all the Jews fault.  If there weren't any Jews to begin with- the Nazis would have picked on some other ethnic group we don't care as much about, and there would be no museum or Henry or bad sushi.  Of course I could  admit  that it was my bad idea to order the food I couldn't pronouce, but blaming the Jewish race seems so much easier right now.   I'm going to go take some more pills and try to get some sleep.
